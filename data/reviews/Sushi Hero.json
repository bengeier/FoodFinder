{"text":"At first look it didn't look so impressive, boy was I wrong! I have eaten sushi for years and the was by FAR the best I have ever had! Absolutely an amazing experience. Thanks choo choo!"}
{"text":"Hands down officially my favorite sushi  restaurant in Las Vegas! Completely worth the drive (about twenty mins from my house in Summerlin; restaurant is located in East LV right off the 515). 

We went midday (1:30) and there was one other group in restaurant - so it wasn't too busy, which allowed the waitress to be attentive and very helpful, which was awesome. I live for great customer service! 

All of us did AYCE and literally everything we ordered was amazing! Fresh fish! We had a bit of everything! I can't wait to go back! 

A few of the rolls we ordered :
*Cowboy Special
*James Bond
*Crunch Roll 
*Hulk Special 
*Jackpot Special 
*Johnny Roll 
*Something Wrong #69

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This guys are great.. it's the sushi brothers.. sushis always on point.. if you sit at the sushi bar.. the chefs will most likely make a special roll not on the menu for you..always fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have the best Sushi! The restaurant is clean and the service is great. It's our second time here and we will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome! My husband and daughter went a couple weeks ago and couldn't stop taking about it so we all went yesterday and they were right. Food was delicious and fresh. The place was very clean and cute. Great lunch and dinner specials."}
{"text":"Really great sushi!! The staff is so nice! Choo Choo and his wife are the best!! I would recommend Sushi Hero to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place blows.. I came here with my girlfriend about a week ago & we were not impressed to say the least...they're variety is limited the fish didn't taste all that fresh its quite pricey they played rap music the whole time (which I hate) the service was slow as snails even though we were the only ones there....honestly I don't see this restaurant being open too much longer...i would rather drive the distance to umiya on W Flamingo...quality food quality service & their fish is ALWAYS fresh"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! The staff were so helpful and polite. The food was fantastically delicious! I ordered the dinner bento box with teriyaki salmon. It included the salmon, choice of appetizer, California or spicy tuna roll, rice, vegetable tempura, shrimp tempura, soup, and a salad. The portions were so big my fiancé and I were so surprised! The bento box is definitely meant for sharing. They even threw in a few free mushroom balls which we were going to order for our appetizer, but we chose more vegetable tempura instead. I am so thankful they included the mushroom balls! They were so mouth watering and yummy, I'd order those for dessert! Overall my experience there was very welcoming and I went home and stuffed my face with some wonderfully delicious food. This may become a regular favorite of mine. I will definitely be going again! Be sure to try the mushroom balls, you will be super happy you did!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've eaten, delicious! Very well priced! No beer though, hopefully soon. Love their food, the chef owner brought out a surprise roll, wow amazing! Hooray for best sushi!!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite place to have lunch with my friends. The waitress already knows me there. Always very friendly. The sushi is great and big portions too, which is what I look for at a sushi place."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.. friendly and attentive wait staff.. detailed and original menu.. we were blown away! Oh and the food is great!.. Freshest sushi in town I will be back! Choo Choo!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at sushi restaurants all over and this is easily one of my favorite if not favorite. The food is so good here. I usually come for lunch and all the employees are so nice and very helpful. Small places like this are the reason sushi became so popular. If you are on this side of town eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, very good service thank you guys. This is my sushi favorite place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Choo Choo is the man!!! Top quality sushi with extremely quick service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place charges for edamame. That's already a red flag! I won't be going back to this place because they're obviously so cheap. I ordered a spider roll and that's the first spider roll ever to not look like a \"spider\"  they literally used one leg for  the roll. I could barely see the meat. It was 95% rice. Listen to the other reviews saying their rolls are all rice and no real filling. It's true. They can fool people who barely eat Japanese food but they can't fool me! See my picture for proof. It's so funny bc a guy behind me kept raving over and over and it is so obvious he hasn't eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants otherwise he would've kept his mouth shut. He said this place would make so much money on the west side.. I have tried places on the west side that give free edamame! And they also don't go cheap - their \"spider roll\" looks like a spider!!! Never going back to this place. Lol. See my picture."}
{"text":"I don't come here often but I've been here twice over the last couple of months. I'm impressed and I've been to a few sushi spots in town. When I come here I haven't waited for my food. I was taken care of quickly. Very very friendly vibe walking in. The location is very clean. I ordered Spicy Tuna and Garlic Tuna and I was pleased. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It was pretty amazing! I had visited this place once before, when they first opened a couple years back, and was disappointed. However, this second time around was so much better. So far the only sushi place I've found on the east side of Vegas. They have 50% off their special rolls after 3pm, and there's SO MUCH to choose from. I did order the dynamite as an appetizer and was not impressed, but the rolls definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place in vegas.  Great service, even better sushi!! The  Poki bowl kicks butt.  Yum yum"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible! Service was very slow and the chefs were very unfriendly and rude. The fish was hot and didn't taste well. Would not recommend anyone ever going back there. Worst $30 I ever spent in my entire life! Please close this place down for the best of the communities interest!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, the service was prompt. Pretty friendly. I would definitely go again. I had the all you can eat dinner and was far from disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi place right next to Smiths, they just opened so be sure to let friends know, this AYCE is indeed a hero for my hunger, A+, 10/10 recommend! After we had ordered some dishes the chefs made things they thought we'd like and we loved them! We eat a lot of nigiri and sashimi and the quality of the fish was excellent and the pieces well prepared. The Sexy Time roll (crispy rice nigiri sexiness, really) is a favorite, along with any of the super spicy ones and the I Love My Ass roll, a not spicy but sesame and garlic white fish one that was lovely. Good to have another super AYCE and A La Carte sushi place! We'll be back every time we think of sushi, thanks Choo Choo and all the chefs and staff for a beauty time!"}
{"text":"Nice neat and cozy little restaurant. I like the layout. The service was very fast and friendly. They have AYCE and you can share the AYCE with a child for a small fee. This is because they don't have a kids menu. 

AYCE is very good value. The rice to fish/seafood ratio is favorable to the customer.Not too much sushi rice paired with the fish/sushi. 

I really like the scallop sushi here. Big chunks of scallops. The quality of the sushi is comparable to all other places. 

They just installed new booths and the place looks really nice. 

This is my favorite sushi restaurant as of today."}
{"text":"My co-worker took me to Sushi Hero for lunch on my birthday and boy that was a really good treat! Their lunch combo is a great deal which comes with an appetizer, miso soup and 2 rolls, all for less than $10! I had the spicy tuna roll and an unagi roll. It was fresh and delicious and not overly packed with rice, something I always look for in all sushi places. For an appetizer I had the garlic spicy edamame which was yummy! They have AYCE lunch too but the lunch combo was very filling. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is 100% the best sushi place in town!!
Every time I come into town I must come in and try their all you can eat menu the entire menu is available when you do the all you can eat option. It's unbelievable they even serve you Uni here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome love their poke wrap. a bit pricey though if you take ur family. Lol.. all you can is the best way to go"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! One of the top places in Las Vegas for Sushi. You can bet on it that I'll be returning again and again.  Thanks again everyone at Sushi Hero."}
{"text":"New place for us!!! Excellent sushi, great service, great taste !! We love it   the chef special was amazing!!! The grand canyon is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Different from other ayce place i have been. New special rolls to chose from. 

Small place but clean. It is not crowded, food came right in time.  Chef used gloves. Staff and chef friendly. Love the sushi with yuzu sauce. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Somewhere between A-OK and \"Yay, I'm a Fan\"
Everyone has their favorite AYCE sushi place in town - and I can see why this could become yours. ...but it's not mine.

If you're visiting from out of town and are thinking of stopping by; it's a perfectly reasonable choice, and you'll probably be happy. 

There was nothing bad about my experience here. But there was nothing that made me get all sushi smiley. It was perfectly serviceable sushi - comparable in price and quality to many other places in town. Even the silly names of the rolls are pretty much the same as everywhere else. 

The rolls were fine. Just fine. 
My favorite was when I ordered the \"Candy Cane\" roll - the sushi chef suggested that I eat it with a side of garlic ponzu sauce. It was the best thing that I tried here. 

The nigiri sushi was on the smallish side - but with AYCE, that's okay with me. You can order more if you like, and I'd rather have a bunch of different things. However; I'd have been disappointed if I had ordered these pieces a la carte. 

The place felt clean - but there was really no ambiance to speak of. I wouldn't bring a date here. 

Even though I'm a big guy, I don't eat a ton. Usually it's two rolls, four pieces of nigiri, and a small piece of mochi ice cream for desert. For about the same price of 30-ish dollars, I'd rather choose to go to somewhere like \"I (heart) Sushi\" in Henderson. It's just better and more interesting food. It's not AYCE, and I might eat less for the same amount of money -
 but I'll enjoy it more."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place! All their rolls are fantastic, service is quick and kind. A wide variety of appetizers. They also have bento boxes! My favorite appetizer is their baked green mussels and their takoyaki. My boyfriend always gets their yellowtail! He swears by it! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Some of the best secret gems are found in the Eastside, esp when it comes to great sushi!! We didn't get the AYCE dinner but what an awesome deal, 50% on their awesome special rolls, even had dessert--we ended up walking out with a $30 bill and fully satisfied (see proof of receipt)! Now where can you get that?  I went by the yelp pics people posted, and it's very true, the 'threesome roll' was really good! Got the 'yumyum lobster roll', side skewer apps are a must! Tempura rolls were made and exactly fried to perfection! Our service was quick, attentive and very accommodating!! Mainly came here out on a whim, saw it didn't have too many reviews, which tells us all of Vegas hasn't discovered this place but yet had enough 5-stars to sway our decision to come here. We'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Customer service is pretty phenomenal along with the sushi. I would assume the owner is the sushi chef? He is very entertaining and makes sushi into art. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The owner is a really cool guy he staff all greet you as you walk in. Don't be shy to order fast and ready when you are! Choo Choo gave us a \"Chef Special\" Roll and they don't use an overwhelming amount of rice. 5 stars for 5 Keys, Friendliness, Speed, Atmosphere, Cleanliness, and of course the SUSHI!
Don't forget to get a stamp card!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!
Being raised in Vegas I've gone to a million sushi places; and this is absolutely AMAZING, from the THEME, FOOD, The CHEF, and wonderful SERVICE. Our server was very inventive with us, the chef was amazing he was very fun! We got happily greeted as we came in, I will be back again! You're missing out if you don't come to this place! :D"}
{"text":"First time here. Came on a recommendation.  Will let you know my results after we are done. So far so good customer service is good. Clean and Grade A from health department too. Customized my order with no fuss. Appreciate that A lot for my dining tonight."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Flamingo and Eastern and was a bit sad because I didn't think there would be any good sushi places around. I was shopping at Smith's on Sandhill and saw a sushi place next door. I checked it out on Yelp, and saw great reviews. My boyfriend, a restaurant owner, and I am just plain picky (especially with fish) when it comes to eating out! I told him based on the reviews we need to at least try it and make up our own mind. We stopped in, and then I realized who the chef was!!! Chef Choo Choo!! I used to sit at his sushi bar each week and eat all you can eat at an old place over in my old neighborhood! I was devastated when he left! Thankfully he's now right around the corner again, even though I would have driven across town if I knew! My love said it was the best sushi place he's eaten at in a long time and gave me a pat on the back! It was so delicious like always! Thanks Chef Choo Choo, you're the best! Staff was great as well, always a plus especially coming from the customer service industry myself!"}
{"text":"I was sold at the spicy garlic edamame. I could tell from the appetizer that these chefs care about ingredients. The vampire roll was phenomenal, the I Love My Ass was flavorful and the Threesome Special was great. I can't get over the edamame. The best part was how fast our food was brought out!"}
{"text":"So yummy had to go back. Service was fast as it was the 1st time I was here. Only downside is it seems they brought all the dishes to 1 side of the table instead of dispersing them out among the group of us there. Didn't take any photos this time as I was too busy eating. Everything was super fresh. Best uni I've ever had in Vegas. Will be going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious sushi. All you can eat for $21.95 yes yes yes. Very creative names too. I would come back when in vegas next."}
{"text":"There's a third Sushi Hero in town- the first two are  high quality spots named after chefs (Sushi Hiroyoshi on the west side and Sushi Hiro in Henderson), while this one is going for a themed, casual AYCE concept. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work.

Their grand opening special (half off rolls) was why I came in, and I suspect responsible in part for the high ratings (along with the overall lack of sushi on this side of town)- I personally found the food extremely average, to the point of mediocre. Sauces were nonexistent or stingy, flavors were plain and lacked punch, fish was not notably fresh. Rolls were small, took a while to come out, and fell apart, even considering we were initially the only customers present. I would not pay their listed \"full price\" for what I received. Maybe I'm in the minority, because they had four tables by the time we left (and most seemed to know the owner) and this is their first review that isnt 5 stars.

Server was efficient and the space has undergone a considerable facelift since the previous owners (Hello Tokyo), but I lost my appetite when I noticed the giant poster of Stalin hanging on the wall. Consider naming your rolls after action figures as a branding move to do something cool and different, and lose the artwork of a guy who massacred millions. Just a thought."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a coworker as this particular sushi place is centrally located and not too far from our workplace. We ordered a la carte since we weren't too hungry, but we were impressed. The restaurant is very clean, the sushi was good, service was nice, and I love the hero theme. The prices weren't too different from other places. I would definitely return again to try their AYCE in the future. They made an awesome first impression. Also, get the green tea ice cream. So good."}
{"text":"Sushi Hero is a great secret hide away. Their fish is always fresh and tasty. Great value for the price of the all you can eat. We love Chu Chu. They will make special request rolls for you that will blow your mind. We keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Average local sushi spot, with friendly, but cheesy chefs and a few unique options on the menu. Overall - the interior of the restaurant needs improvement and the price is too high for their AYCE as compared to the service, variety and quality of nearby sushi restaurants. I'll probably go back and update this review in a few months. (3 Stars) - updated as service and options continue to improve. Nice to see a local place continue to grow."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and service! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and ordered 4 rolls. They were half price due to an evening special and therefore were great value. The sushi chef was very helpful when we needed roll recommendations, I will be returning here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered on UberEATS and it's awesome!!! I got two rolls one was the Jackpot. Anyways they gave me free mix poki!!! They're so cute I will be visiting soon!!! Food was awesome tho thank u !"}
{"text":"Great place! Love the all you can eat and amazing poke bowls. Excellent customer service and pretty easy to order take out. I've taken my 9 month old here and they were so sweet they gave her some tofu. Overall my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"Super Sushi!  ^-^  I honestly feel like Sushi Hero has the best All You Can Eat Sushi out in Vegas.  The salmon, hamachi, and unagi were all good.  Not the best quality but its the best quality I've had from an all you can eat establishment.   The rolls also were very tasty.  Another highlight was dessert!  I had the tempura ice cream which was bomb!  Loved it and highly reccomend it.  Sushi Hero is definitely my new go to spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite  sushi spots. Quality of  fish is great,  fish to rice ratio is impressive. They have a vast variety of choices for ayce. Friendly service. 
Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"The Best AYCE Sushi in Vegas. Love this place. Sushi Is fresh and Everyone there is so nice."}
{"text":"Really great, fresh and tasty sushi. The sashimi salad dressing was truly fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"So amazing! Picked a roll and then had the server suggest one and hers was hands down so much better! So clean there and everything tastes so fresh"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted sushi but did not want to go to far ( China Town ) we tried this place and we will definitely come here. sushi was amazing ,service was fun ,fresh food ,let's just say that this place is my number one choice now and I have been to so many sushi places around Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is amazing even my 11 year old was grubbing it up. Super and the hamachi mama is to die for"}
{"text":"We had been searching for a good AYCE sushi place on our new side of town. So glad we found sushi hero! Restaurant was clean and the staff was all super friendly. Everything thing we tried was amazing! At some AYCE places they go a little heavy on the rice but, here the fish to rice ratio was perfect! I'm the only vegetarian in my family so sushi can be hard for me to find something but, sushi hero had so many vegetarian options! Plus the tempura ice cream is a must have!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once after they first opened and more recently. My first visit was great and I'm happy to say the second visit was even better! I prefer AYCE sushi restaurants and Sushi Hero doesn't disappoint. This place is my go-to from now on. The wait staff is friendly and attentive and the rolls are delicious. Order the sushi nachos, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time at this sushi place normally we go to SAKANA but its always a 1hr waiting. I was gonna go eat some PHO but i wanted to give a try to this sushi place. 
PROS: clean, not to busy, nice service, great sushi and salads
CONS: tooooo much rice in the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for several reasons! 
1 - Creativity! Definitely one of the most creative AYCE sushi menus that I've seen (and I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places!) The Poke appetizer is bomb! I didn't care for the sauce on the Sushi Nacho, but still so creative! Loved the \"Salmon Tartare\" (it was salmon and crab), as well! And there were so many creative rolls that I want to come back and try, including rice-free rolls and baked rolls. 
2 - Quality! The Tuna Poke appetizer totally blew my mind. Huge chunks of Poke, well seasoned. Yum! Also had some really delicious rolls. There were some where I didn't quite love the seasoning or sauce (example - the Red Rock roll was too sour/lemony), but that is just trial and error. Props to them for the creativity. The quality was there with everything I ordered. 

My only complaint - I wish they let you order your food with paper sheets, like most other AYCE places. Ordering with the waitress can be a little awkward, when you want to stuff your face. Also, she doesn't come over to ask if you want more. But she's friendly when you do order. 

Anyway, will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are nice and are filling.  service is good as well.  I would recommend you try this location as it is not a yuppie sushi location."}
{"text":"I saw this place earlier today . I checked the reviews An all of the ones I read were good An that was enough to try it . Super good food \"Soo\" was very nice . The place is all new an very quiet . I'm glad I found this place , it's close to where I stay when I come to Vegas An I'll defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Sushi hero's atmosphere is awesome. What I like about this place, is they don't rush you. Most all you can eat places will do their best to have you in and out, and our servers never made us faces because of our large group, they instead said, \"bring it on!\" What makes us feel very comfortable is each time we go, they recommend us a roll, the chef knows my sister and is always welcoming to our family. They even let your sushi digest a bit before coming to your table to take your dessert. There was a promotion, 5 AYCE, 1 free, so keep that in mind! Don't know how long they'll have it. Take your stamp card, each 10 AYCE stamps gets you a free one!"}
{"text":"They have really good nigiri  Karai, karai tuna, salmon, salmon belly (special), unagi, yellowtail were excellent. 

The location is a bit dodgy in the older part of town but the food were great and service was also very good. 

Keep up the good work, Sushi Hero! 

We will come back!!!"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding new sushi joint.  The service was excellent.  Almost too good, like eating at a fancier restaurant.  The lunch special includes 2 rolls, an appetizer, and a soup or salad for only $9.99 or $13.95, classic or special rolls, respectively.  The gyoza had a nice kick and the miso was your standard, good miso.  I had the Caterpillar Roll and the Mistake Roll, both delicious.  For a sweet finish, try the Vanilla Tempura Ice Cream.  The tempura doesn't overpower the ice cream, as it sometimes can, and it's just the right size.  Tell only the right amount if people, because I'd rather have this place all to myself, but stay busy enough to stick around."}
{"text":"I go to the LVAC in this parking lot so happened to notice this place under construction a few months ago. 

Today, the wife and I were looking for an AYCE sushi spot and decided to look into it on Yelp. 5 stars on 81 reviews- it's was must try!

Naturally, went with the AYCE option because it only makes sense! $26.95 a person. At about $70 total with tax and tip for 2 people, it felt a little expensive but maybe it's the going rate. We haven't done AYCE sushi in over a year so I don't remember how the price compares. 

The waitress was super friendly, the chefs were cheerful. We were the only people in the whole restaurant eating at 4:30 on a Saturday and I was pretty shocked to see that.

The chef sent us over a white albacore special (that we didn't order) which we certainly appreciated. If we were paying for stuff and got a freebie, it would have felt like an even better gesture but regardless it was still very thoughtful so we appreciated it! 

A ton of great menu options. There was nothing I didn't like. My wife is more picky than me and said she felt like some of the fish that laid on top of her rolls was a little too thick. I say the more protein the better so I had no issue with it. 

If I'm in the area looking for AYCE sushi, I'll definitely keep this place in mind. 

I say definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"I came here based on all of the other amazing reviews and was not disappointed! Speedy service and quality food, I will be coming back again soon! They have a very large selection of unique rolls. Very satisfied with my entire experience."}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome and the staff was super friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner! I stand firm in my love for Sushi Hero!! Every single thing I've eaten is bomb! Fresh and delicious! One of the servers asked how my baby was, that is so thoughtful of her to remember and ask us that ! We've only been one other time! I tried some dinner items this times, loved them all. This is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant. I don't need to look any further :). Love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi that I've been to so far.  Staff is very friendly. Wait time for your food is fast. Would highly recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for an early mother's day. We wanted to try somewhere new, and this was super close to both our homes. 

When we walked in we were greeted and sat at a booth. Our waitress asked what we wanted to drink, just water, and told us about the specials that day, they were posted on the wall. We started with miso soup, agedashi tofu, and the sashimi roll. Tuna, yellowtail, salmon, and crab wrapped in cucumber (no rice!) with \"s.o\" sauce. It was pretty small, but we liked it that way. We get to try more stuff!!

While eating, we looked through the menu and decided to try a half roll of the double d, half of the yellow yellow with no cream cheese, a something wrong 69, which was tasty but a little dry, and some nigiri. The yuzu yellowtail is delish. The garlic tuna was also super super good, and the ikrua was fresh tasting. We tried a couple specials, salmon belly, oyster, and toro. The salmon belly and toro didn't have much flavor, and part of the salmon was hard to chew. The oyster was HUGE. Probably the biggest one I've ever seen. 

We also tried the salmon carpaccio, which I would avoid, sashimi nacho, which was pretty tasty and interesting, and shrimp balls and mushroom balls. The shrimp balls weren't really sphere shaped at all, and didn't have much shrimp flavor. All I really tasted was eel sauce. 

The service was pretty good and friendly, but the lady never refilled our water, and like super awkwardly pulled an empty dish I was using for soy sauce RIGHT out of my hand as I was moving it. I assumed she thought I was giving it to her maybe? She was also the only waitress in the place. It isn't big in there, but it was pretty busy for lunch. Also, the sushi bar only seats maybe 8 people.

Overall, I really really like this place. Might be more like 3.5, but I'll be nice."}
{"text":"We came here at 9:10pm and they told us that they close at 10pm. I don't understand why they would close their kitchen almost an hour before they say that they close. They might as well just change their hours then if you turn around customers almost a whole hour before it says that you close. No desire to come back and try this place out after that."}
{"text":"I'm extremely picky with sushi restaurants and this place definitely hit the spot. I live right around the corner have been traveling across the valley to hit up some of my normal sushi spots. One day I just said screw it and gave Sushi Hero a try. I was very happy with the selection on the menu. I went with my mom who isn't as adventurous with her sushi choices and there were things that suited her tastes on the menu as well. I had Garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail (my favorite), salmon belly, the ono and jalapeño special, the sashimi roll, and a cup of miso soup. Let me start off by saying that the owner choo choo used to be a chef at my favorite sushi place in town jjanga. So a lot of the things on the menu were very similar. The Yuzu yellowtail was amazing (fresh!) and if you haven't tried yuzu yellowtail I would definitely recommend you trying it next time you grab some sushi. The garlic tuna was good as well. I'm a sucker for a good ponzu and theirs definitely hit the spot. The sashimi roll was delicious and not too heavy. The salmon belly was just as it should be, melt in your mouth and delicious. The ono special was good I just am not personally a fan of seared super white, but the flavors over all were good. Miso is miso and I was pleased with it. Let me just finish off by saying that everything I had was very tasty. My mom also agreed as she got some more basic rolls and was happy with all of them. Also they DO NOT skimp on the fish. Most of my nigiri had huge pieces of fish on very small rice which is rare to find in an all you can eat place. Definitely going back. I'm actually considering taking a walk down there today for lunch on my day off!"}
{"text":"I was visiting vegas for literally 36 hours and was craving sushi. Didn't want to go to the strip for the outrageous prices so we went off the beaten path for this gem.

Our Uber drove us into the strip mall and we were both pretty confused. This place got great reviews and didn't expect it to be strip mall sushi.

It looked closed because of the dark windows but as soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. We both got all you can eat sushi of course. We ordered...edamame, spicy edamame, gyoza, vegetable tempura, bulgogi, fat ass roll, miso soup, crunch roll, shrimp lover, banzai roll, hulk burrito, chicken teriyaki, vanilla tempura ice cream and green tea ice cream. WOW.

This sushi can't be beat. My favorite parts of the meal were the bulgogi and the vanilla tempura ice cream. I have only eaten bulgogi (and liked it) in NYC's Koreatown. Delicious! You've gotta come here and do it up like we did!"}
{"text":"VERY pleasantly surprised!!!  Have to admit this was a Plan B because my Plan A is closed on Mondays.  Sushi Hero was nearby, open and had good reviews.  I entered VERY skeptical, with my sushi-snob nose in the air because they offer AYCE and 50%off rolls... So it couldn't possibly be good, right?  Wrong!  The ambiance is nice, but casual enough. The staff, both chef and server, greeted us happily as soon as we entered and accommodated, patiently, our indecision over table vs. sushi-bar. (the bar won). The sushi chef, Brandon (If I heard him correctly after saki) was attentive, fun, funny and really really good with his flavor profiles.  He caught on quickly to what we liked (good fish, nothing sweet, not alot of sauces. Sauces should \"enhance\" not \"overwhelm\" or cover up), and just started making the perfect items for us.  We might throw out a general direction to go and he'd come back with a flavor combination/profile that elevated the mundane to the outrageously yummy.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My kids and I decided to try Sushi Hero on a whim....not disappointed at all. The quality of fish used is quite good for an AYCE restaurant and the price for dinner is good, $26.95. The staff is efficient and very friendly. I do believe we or at least I will be back again."}
{"text":"I feel I can give a fair review of this place because I was a customer since opening day. The restaurant has grown steadily and I'm extremely fond of this establishment. Being from California, I have had my share of amazing sushi and this place is comparable. I like to have the all you can eat at the sushi bar. The service, staff and the owner Chu Chu are awesome. I'm glad to see that they're doing so well."}
{"text":"Can never say enough! Staff is amazing and the sushi is better than that! We drive over 100 miles to eat here! This is my 4th time and Ill come back till the end of time!"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is delicious. The all you can eat was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Honestly get off the strip and try this place. Great service and good recommendations. Huge assortment of sushi and when we were stuffed they gave us mochi instead of our remaining apps.  Will return when in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great staff and service.  Normally I hang out at my usual spot but I was looking for sushi on lunch break and heard about this place on FB. You need to come here. The menu is big and everything I ordered was awesome. They just opened about three months ago and it is prime to jump off. Cancel your plans and get down to sushi hero asap!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since opening.

I have an infatuation with spicy tuna and this place does not disappoint. My wife is more along the lines of sushi virgin so the crunch roll or any shrimp tempura does wonders for her.

We recently tried the all you can eat and it was everything dreams are made of!"}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi restaurant, this one was the best off the beaten path in Las Vegas. This Sushi chefs on duty of 1/7/17 did a very amazing job with all their great works of good sushi rolls plus the server is working that night took very good care of me. I will definitely have to make this 1 of my top 10 places for AYCE sushi. I hope to come again soon and get the same great experience I had while I was here for CES trade show."}
{"text":"Great place, cozy and clean, they could work on the birthday surprise a bit but service and food were both fantastic"}
{"text":"Decided this time around visiting Vegas to venture out into the local neighborhoods and become in a sense a resident not a tourist so me and my gf were craving sushi and Sushi Hero it is. One thing that caught are attention was the 50% off Sat night special. Now a lot of times your thinking well 50% off on a Sat night this place must be doing bad or whatnot trying to drum up the business but hell no not here! Let me say AMAZING sushi with rolls on the larger side. Taste and uniqueness were very on point. I can't exactly recall the name of all the rolls we tried but all were super good especially the beef bowl appetizer which I can't recall once again the name. Service was very friendly and the prices were on point. Vegas takes the crown with Sushi some way some how over the years my visits to other major cities nothing could touch this place. 

5 out of 5 all day long no questions asked I will hold them to the top honors and someone has to dethrone them at this point in my travels!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the service. They are soo fast at getting you food, refilling your drinks, and clearing your plate. I'm really impressed with how personable everyone is. Light hearted and fun environment. The food was spectacular and the quality of the fish felt great to taste. I recommend the chef specials for the day. Tried a few things i wouldn't normally and now I'll get it on the regular. Thanks for saving me sushi hero!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi and It took no time at all to make It! I'm from Alaska where sushi is to die for so I was skeptical about the sushi here but their daily deals are wonderful and the sushi tastes great!"}
{"text":"I really love Sushi Hero! The service is always amazing and their sushi tastes fresh. It's sort of a hidden gem, in my opinion since it's away from everything else. Even when it gets busy, the servers are very attentive and kind. Their appetizers are really delicious, as well. My personal go-tos are always the garlic yellowtail and tuna. I easily eat 10 orders of each! Tables are all a nice decent size and the restaurant itself is spacious for a sushi joint. I don't like going anywhere else now! They also have a stamp card so on your 10th visit, I believe, you get a free AYCE."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Amazing! Sat at the bar on a very busy Sunday night and got super lucky with Brandon as our chef. All of the sushi here is delicious and generously portioned with the fish/rice ratio. The fish is super fresh! We ordered AYCE plus a bento box and it was all bomb. Even though they were slammed with orders Brandon took care of us with his exceptional customer service. Our waitress only came around a couple of times and our dishes piled up pretty high but luckily we had a ton of table space at the bar, we also were without drinks for a little while because she never came back to check on us. 
Some yummy dishes: The bulgogi here is really good it's not too sweet and the pieces are pretty big. The dynamite as an appetizer is delicious grab an order. All of the nigiri is delicious. 
Overall it's an awesome place probably the best sushi on the east side of town! I'll definitely come back but probably when it's not as busy. Five stars for delicious food and great service from Brandon!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! Great sushi! Great service! A.y c.e . $21.95 until 3pm,  $26.95 3pm - close."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place last night, a little gem.  Live in Vegas and I rate this as the best Sushi Restaurant.   Great staff and chef, easy to park and great value, we will be back in the next couple of weeks.   Fantastic"}
{"text":"I'm stuck on this place. I started with Yamasushi (Maryland parkway location) then met Sakana and then met sushi hero. These are my 3 favorites. But being that Sushi Hero is on my side of town and next to my gym makes it even better. But besides location, i love everything here. I always start out with baked mussels, Shrimp tempura and Tako. I also love their random specials and surprises. And apple saki yummmayyyyyy. Oyster shooters!!!! Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Beyond average. I don't understand why this place currently has five stars on Yelp. The establishment is clean, but mostly consists of rolls, undercooked rice, and run of the mill fish. Soy sauce is from the bottle. There are plenty of other wonderful sushi places nearby. Go there instead!"}
{"text":"Really nice sushi place, super nice people running the place and food is good. Many sushi rolls to pick from, I think over 40 rolls. Fair price on rolls and bento boxes."}
{"text":"Fish are friends, not food... said NO ONE! New favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. We've been here 3xs and it only keeps getting better. We always ask to sit at the bar for a more personal experience.

Staff is friendly and we love the brothers (there's 3). Ethan and Damian are great Sushi Chefs. Ethan always comes up with unique creations just for us. Truly makes us feel special. 

Salmon nigiri is my favorite. Literally melts in your mouth like a piece of cotton candy. Do not judge me, but I eat about 10 pieces of it. Yellow tail nigiri is another favorite of mine. 
Spicy garlic edamame is spicy and full of garlic flavor. 
Fries oysters are fried to perfection followed by a soft gooey inside. 
Many of the specialties rolls are tasty, but we prefer the real deal of just the fish itself. 

Not once have we had an unpleasant experience, looking forward to many more visits to come."}
{"text":"Man, I feel like Yelp really let us down on this one. 

We have been wanting to come down and try this new spot for a while now due to it being extremely close to the house. We stopped by once but saw that it was $26.95 for all you can eat which is much more expensive than other sushi joints in the area (21.95-23.95 is the average.)

Well, today our favorite sushi spot was too crowded so we thought, \"why not? Let's try the other spot. The yelp reviews are all five stars so let's give it a go.\"

Right when we sat down we were a bit take aback at just how the interior didn't feel like other sushi spots. Let's face it, if you're going to plop $30 a person on dinner, you want to be in a nice environment. It's not exactly a cheap outing when you're doing sushi, so interesting decor and cleanliness is basically top of mind. This place is not modern in the least bit, the booth seats are old and weathered and springs poke into your butt as you sit. Not a great first impression. 

We continued on and ordered our usual ayce which consists of mostly sushi (fish and rice) and a few half rolls. When the fish came, it was presented well and looked nice enough. However, once we took a bite, something was severely missing. The fish tasted bland and the rice was off. Now, we aren't sushi experts by any means but we have eaten enough to know good fish and proper sushi; and this ain't it. 

The salmon belly was still frozen and crunchy on the tail end of the cut which was really disappointing since this is a favorite of ours. We knew we didn't have a good experience when we began ordering mostly rolls with cream cheese which is something we never do but man, that was the only thing tasting right at this point. 

The wait staff is very nice and extremely attentive and for that I'm giving two stars. However, the price of this ayce at $26.95 coupled with subpar sushi makes this a hard pass any time we are looking for our sushi fix. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Smith's for their grocery store sushi; it's cheaper and tastes better. 

All jokes aside, Yama is just up the street and is some of the best sushi in town. Don't waste your paycheck here (literally with the price of this damn place.)

That's $60 we wont be getting back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Omg, omg, omg this place is amazing and well priced, fresh, flavorful, and filling. AYCE has the best options and most roll s can be ordered as a half so you can try more."}
{"text":"Service was blah... the lady had attitude and was just like irritated but when she went to the table next to us then she was having a conversation and being nice to the ppl and the rolls sucked... the end"}
{"text":"Ya no.... No bueno.. I dont recommend this place. Sushi had no flavor and some of the orders said they had something and then were served with something else (like cream cheese .. eww) Lastly the service was not that good .. our main server was the buser because the waitress was doing something else? Our first and last time here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best and freshest sushi I have ever had. I am in town from California and picked this place because it is close to my mom's house. Amazing service, amazing sushi, and amazing cleanliness. You can tell the chef is so proud of his work and you can absolutely taste the freshness in the fish. My mom and sister both said they will be coming here regularly now!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Did all you can eat dinner which is a very good value. Considering the price, very good sushi, lots of choices and options and very fresh fish. Monday night so not many people. The service was just ok. Some guy who is new and doesn't know much. Couldn't really recommend anything which would have been very important to the first time guest. A girl stopped by to check on me and at least she was able to recommend something very popular to try. Helpful. So overall four stars but with better service it's likely to improve."}
{"text":"Well my favorite sushi spot closed, but this place has many of the same items!  Such as Apple #1, Something Wrong 69, and Karai Tuna.  Not all sushi places include those rolls in the menu.  

I started with some mini udon and nigiris.  Got the Karai Tuna, which comes with rice, wrapped in seaweed, and served in 2 pieces.  Also got the garlic tuna and the ono (super white tuna) with garlic ponzu.  The Kara Tuna are bulky 2 pieces of sushi.  The garlic tuna and ono came perfect with the garlic ponzu on both.  

I ordered the Big Easy Roll, but I requested to substitute albacore with salmon.  It's very similar to the Something Wrong 69, but with less action (which is fine because the Something Wrong 69 sometimes has too much going on).  Both rolls are my favorites, and I'm not saying 1 is better than the other.  Something Wrong 69 roll comes with a variety of fish, soft shell crab, and shrimp tempura and ponzu sauce while the Big Easy Roll that I ordered came with salmon, soft shell crab, and ponzu sauce.  I guess it's a milder roll compared to the Something Wrong 69. 

Everything I ordered as mentioned above was excellent.  The only item I thought that wasn't mind blowing was the mini udon.  The portion was a little bit bigger than a mini (bigger than I expected), and the flavor was mediocre.  I think I will skip the mini udon next time.

This is a great place to try AYCE!"}
{"text":"We now have a new favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas ! Well worth the $27pp that we paid. We came on a slow day so maybe that's why everything came in quickly. We got all kinds of yummy off the menu items. Everything was fresh. Chef Choo choo was funny and really nice and so was the lady serving us. I wish I could name a favorite or two but everything was so good, they're all faves!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot! Great prices, lunch is $21.95 and dinner is 26.95 all you can eat! Staff is really friendly! I am seriously loving this place! Everyone needs to come and try it. It reminds me of a hole in the wall kind of place. In the smiths parking lot by LvAc, kind of hidden but great place!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit at Sushi Hero. What can I say? It's amazing!!!! 

Menu: Tons of selections for rolls, apps, and sushi. Great variety in what's offered: even sushi burritos!!!! Their fish is extremely fresh; their yellowtail, salmon, and tuna are phenomenal! 

Service: Excellent!!! The wait staff, busperson, and Chef are very attentive, quick, and kind. They are so prompt in removing dishes from the table, refilling your drinks, and checking in on how you're doing. 

Location: New! So clean, you could eat off the floor! 

Really appreciate their price too. 27$ for dinner AYCE. Buy 10 get one free stamp card! :)

I used to go to Yama Sushi down the street. Loved Yama but the wait and service are outrageous now. Definitely will keep coming back."}
{"text":"they're amazing . it's new and not much clientele just yet but the good is amazing , one of the best, and the service is in point . I think I found my favorite sushi place"}
{"text":"Was very surprised by how good the sushi was here. I've been to many sushi places in Vegas & this is by far one of the best sushi places I've tried. The sushi chef is very animated & fun. He also brought us a free roll of his special of the day for us to try. Overall great sushi & dining experience I have already told friends & family to come try it out. Thanks for the great experience I will be back."}
{"text":"I love sushi but never had any AYCE sushi. We came here because they offer buy 2 AYCE get 1 free AYCE. Perfect for me and my daughters.
The food came fast, taste good and fresh, servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't had good service in a while and this place amazed me with everyone smiling and the very much engaged sushi man! Easy parking despite how busy the mall was. 
I had tuna poke bowl and let me say!!!!! The best in town!!!! Sauce and spice was perfect. You must try this place for those visiting on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Not fancy but nice and they weren't over crowded on Friday evening. I'm picky about eating raw fish. If I smell fishy odor, peace I'm out. It was very clean and no fishy smells. Preparation was OK, service good and we will probably visit again."}
{"text":"Was visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to goto a good sushi spot that locals eat.  Found this place through good reviews and was pleasantly surprised.  If your looking for a good sushi at a good price away from the craziness from the strip this is the place!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Absolutely loved the inside. Not a sushi person, was with a friend but the food was really good. Super cool sitting at the bar watching the chef roll the sushi. Music was awesome. I plan to bring any of my friends who love sushi here. The service was wonderful and every employee couldn't have been nicer. Great little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem is las veags me and my wife come here alot. Just on our last visit we tried the all you can eat... OMG WTF!! some places limit what you can get but not here. The entire menu was available. For one low price you can not beat that. The sushi is second to none here and the crazy part is every time we went it wasn't crowded. I recommend this place to any and everyone who like... correction... anyone who LOVES sushi. We will continue to come her all the time. Oh one more thing... the names of the sushi rolls are amazing. One is called taste like my ex girlfriend lol and the my fat ass roll.. great place great atmosphere check it out the quotes on the wall too. Lol"}
{"text":"I only go out for sushi.  Out of town and found this place and OMG soooo good!   I asked sushi chef Brendon what to order.  He was dead on w/each order, flavor was yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots here in Las Vegas . We've been ordering from here on DoorDash for the last few months and I've never been disappointed . I'm very happy to order the \"Fat Ass Roll\" every time ! The miso soup is outstanding as well ! The delivery is always ahead of schedule and at our door in at least half the time they've quoted ! I came into the actual establishment at opening this morning and was offered the lunch special - I couldn't pass it up ! I usually purchase a single deep fried roll and soup but for $3.00 more , the lunch special gave an extra roll and appetizer ! Can't beat that ! I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on accident after working out ..bomb food great service ..great price .. best sushi on the East side"}
{"text":"Sushi love!! The all u can eat lunch is bomb.  There are so many options and all rolls made fresh to order.  The price includes soup and dessert too.  I opted for the large poke bowl with tuna and salmon and loved it.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here for lunch on Saturday.  We did the AYCE sushi.  The rolls were okay.  The ones marked really spicy were not even spicy.  The ones with garlic really had garlic.  I don't even remember which ones we ordered.  The service was good though, which is not always the story at an place that offers AYCE.  I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I really liked the food. Their appetizers are flavorful. But honestly their servers made the experience so much better. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. I can't have raw fish but my boyfriend was having it and it was delicious. we tried a little bit of every different thing he can find and I'm very picky but I loved it. Everyone was extremely nice from the waitresses to the sushi chef. I would definitely recommend everyone to try this. I don't eat raw fish so I'm extremely picky but all of their stuff was extremely good I still didn't have raw fish but I had deep fried rolls and shrimp tempora rolls. And at the end the chef brought me a roll since he seen all I wanted was shrimp tempora and it was so good. YOU MUST TRY IT!! You won't be disappointed. 

Presentation of the rolls was beautiful and I loved that they make the pieces small I hate biting them to a big piece of real I'm not good with chopsticks so I hate eating half a piece of the role and then eating the other half because it falls apart. So the size was perfect for me. 


Great job everyone. My new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Booths are hard where you can feel the springs in your ass.

They were playing loud hood music. \"I'm going to fu** your bitch\" playing over and over. The next song proceeded to say \"nigg* this and f**k those hoes\"... 
completely disgusted . 
This is the third time I've been here, never have I heard such inappropriate music in a restaurant. They didn't seem to care after I made it clear how inappropriate the music was and then decided not to order.

I couldn't believe it. Never again.
We didn't stay to eat .
What's worse, on the way out- the two sushis chefs started singing the songs really loudly to annoy us."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff at Sushi Hero. I came here tonight wanting some sushi and was very pleased with the results as I have never been here before. Sally was very inviting and accommodating and helped me get a seat at the bar and was very friendly - she brought me sake and beer and helped me order appropriately. The two sushi gentlemen, Ethan and Brandon - who prepared the sushi were very friendly and they recommended I get the all you can eat in order to save money. I love this place! It's certainly my preferred spot as I've just moved here from Los Angeles and need a sushi location! Thanks, Sally!"}
{"text":"The  best!  Very  Good Quality    Very good Staff    Everything  Fresh  !   The best  AYCE   Sushi   In Vegas !"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. We ordered AYCE and were not disappointed.

Being able to order half rolls is great -- that way, we get to try more rolls.

The staff is extremely courteous."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now both a la carte & all you can eat & I thoroughly enjoy the food & the service. I tend to stick to the all you can eat for more bang for my buck. I like that they are open until 11pm most days & last call is at 10:30. It's down the street from home so that doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"What a place! Found on Yelp. The owner Chu Chu really took care of me. He is creative and willing to make things not on the menu just for you! I wish I could come back soon. Unfortunately I live in Reno not Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. 
Treated my bf out to a sushi bday dinner and he chose this place. I was a little sketched out bc of the side of town it's on, but this place does not disappoint. 

Their fresh oysters are amazing! I always wish you can order more than one.. the sauce paired perfectly with a good sized oyster. 

We ordered their salmon and garlic tuna. YUM. Such good quality fish, the sauce was amazing and Their fish to rice ratio put the cherry on top!

We also ordered a few appetizers here and there, with the same amount of satisfaction. 

The only thing I didn't like were the actual rollls. We only ordered 2, and they weren't that great. However, it did not bother me as I prefer nigiri over rolls. 

All in all, 5/5. The servers were fantastic! The sushi was fresh! And the price ain't bad. Love love love."}
{"text":"Had a quick meal a la carte. Miso, sashimi salad, and unagi roll. All very good. Service was very good--there was a demanding party of 10 having AYCE at the same time, but my service was not delayed."}
{"text":"We have been trying numerous places since we moved here and many have just not lived up to our expectations. We went for lunch & they have great flavors, some pop in your mouth, service was great and very fast where many places you sit & wait & fill up on water......We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was great. When me & my girlfriend came here it was only us. It was like 30-45 min till closing and they were very nice and patient. Didn't seem frustrated or anything. Just kind. 
We ordered a few things and my girlfriend is picky and she really liked this place. 
The bulgogi was soooo good 
I was just in a happy place there. 
This was around April 23rd when i went
But i can't wait to go back. 
The prices are normal. A tiny bit pricy. But i mean it was a great night so i guess it really doesn't matter especially when the customer service is great. 
The guy who was behind the counter was talking to us which i thought was pretty nice and cool he was funny and also helped me out with choices because I'm not a big sushi eater and i don't like raw food. Oh yeah. I was looking at the menu wrong and ordered something my mom suggested. I didn't know it was raw and the woman was kind enough to make something else free of charge, but i didn't let her. I just picked it off because i didn't want to be that person. Lol. Thanks we will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat, the sushi chefs listen to all sorts of music and they have fun with their creations. The price is about the same as other sushi joints, and they have a stamp card which is nice. The service is good and the restaurant has been clean every time I have been there. I am always a little hesitant to try new seafood places but this definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place hands down was worth the drive and the cost. The service was good and they brought our food out quickly. There are a wide variety of items to taste and explore. They have an all you can eat menu. The Teriyaki Beef and Chicken was also delicious for those that don't like Sushi in your group. We ate so fast we didn't even take pics because things were getting passed around. Of 7 people there wasn't a single item we didn't like. 

I posted pics of the menu....."}
{"text":"Ok. We tried this because of the rating from Yelp (~4.5) and it was on our way home. Easy to get to. Not exactly the chic part of LV but the reviews said it was nice inside with good service. ALL TRUE. Clean, helpful waitress who pointed out all the eel dishes (my favorite). We passed on the $26 \"all you can eat (in one hour-fine print) not cuz that's too expensive but because we didn't want to be little sushi piggies. Anyway, tuna poki was really good, cold, spicy, fresh. Eel hand roll was loaded with both smooth avocado and eel. Just right. Did caterpillar roll with soy paper. And, the \"I love sushi\" with one pepper was plenty hot. Glad I didn't order a three pepper dish.  A scoop of tempura vanilla ice cream split between two was really good and we walked out for $43.  We will be back. Honest meal, good service. Go there."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD! we came on a Saturday evening and it was happy hour so most of the rolls were 50% off - which was great but either way it would be worth it.

THe fish is very fresh.  The flavors are not typical to what you would find at most sushi restaurants, and the menu has a variety of traditional and non-traditional items; cooked and raw.

The decor is pretty modern and very clean.  The staff is attentive and welcoming and very helpful explaining the menu and specials - it seems like they always have some sort of special.

I don't live in the area but would definitely return."}
{"text":"At first I thought this place was gonna be a hole in the wall but when I walked in it was very modern and clean. Newly revamped.

The sushi was soooo good and I was very surprised ! And the price is amazing as well. When it comes to sushi I am very sceptic especially if it's an all you can eat place however this place was far from disappointing. 

I ordered 2 rolls and all were refreshing and tasty! 

Only downer I would say is the rolls are very small. 

But this is definitely my go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"We ordered the Japanese lasagna (amazing) the volcano (delicious) and the taste like my ex-girlfriend (my lady liked it but a little to hot for my taste) but overall worth it"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for sushi and we have been to a lot of sushi restaurants!  The service is always great and the food always amazes us.  We have a lot of sushi restaurants close by our house and we drive to this one.  Thanks choo choo!"}
{"text":"So this is my new favorite sushi spot at the staff here is absolutely amazing the rolls are so good and fresh I like coming here for the lunch specials are a great price reasonably price the ambiance is awesome"}
{"text":"Chef Choo Choo is the best! Our first time was a 5 star experience!

He made us feel completely at home .. you can tell he has a passion for what he does & it shows. The AYCE menu is huge & everything we had was super fresh! The restaurant has a lot of space as well.

Our waitress/server was nice, wait wasn't long for anything but when she was busy Chef Choo Choo even helped out taking another customers order he is AWESOME! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously where has this place been all my life. Came here for my Bday and everything tasted fresh. I normally don't like Ngiri but Holy moly the white tuna with the garlic ponzu was so tasty and just melted. We had a couple of rolls and gy?za, edamame etc. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Gourmet quality food, family owned, clean and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Another wonderful sushi place I'm glad to have found in this city!
I absolutely love AYCE sushi, it's practical, is the best deal for your dollar and allows for the you to try a different variety of sushi each time! 
We decided to sit at the bar, this is usually the fastest way to order and it's super interesting watching the chefs make everyone's rolls. Well, for us it is. 
The service was very attentive, they were great at making sure we got what we needed. I did feel like our appetizers did take long to arrive but they made sure to send each out when they were ready.
I did wish that they would advertise that you can order half rolls for some orders. Sometimes I just want a few bites of certain rolls. Our chef was super funny and towards the end was extremely engaging which we enjoy a lot! 
Check this place out!

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"So I was a fan of the place that used to occupy this location.  It was with a bit of anxiety that I chose to go to the new restaurant.  However that anxiety was soon changed to happiness as I hungrily explored their expansive menu.  

Sushi Hero did a lot of modernizing to this place and although the other place was awesome, this place has a huge menu, amazing staff, fresh fish, and a great ambiance.  

Everything I ate exploded in my mouth with a variety of delicious flavors.  I will definitely be back, there are so many items I have yet to try.

It's definitely among my favorite all you can eat sushi places, not just on the East side  but in all the city.  If you're nearby, you owe it to your taste buds to give Sushi Hero a try.  Ask not what your taste buds can do for you, but what you can do for your taste buds."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype!  Although it's in a strip mall, the service is excellent, prompt and attentive. The food is great. Try the garlic tuna or yuzu yellowtail.  The all you can eat is a terrific deal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. I don't understand why YELP insists on marking my review not recommend, I live less than a mile from sushiro and come often I don't have the time to review every single time. But so be it. Come to this sushi restaurant if you want fresh, good and reasonbly priced sushi and all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I saw all 5 stars on Yelp but man are they right!! My husband and I did all you can eat. They give you enough time without feeling rushed. They also don't rush in between orders. We had the sexy bom roll, I love sushi roll and the Japanese lasagna. We also ordered an assortment of nigiri. Everything was delicious! The nigiri was fresh and the perfect size. Absolutely amazing place! The chef even sent over a special roll that wasn't on the menu which was delicious!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed EVERYTHING about Sushi Hero!  VERY nice employees! Choo Choo, Damian and Sue.....It was a very nice experience!! I honestly can say I liked ALL the sushi rolls I ordered, P.S. They also sell sake, wine  and beer.  :-)   Don't let the (crappy) Smith's / strip mall  parking lot  scare you. THIS WAS TRULY A DELIGHT AND NICE PRICES TOO!"}
{"text":"I have to say out of all the sushi spots I have gone to this one has to be the worst. The sushi just ain't all that great. And 2 of my moochis were rock hard, didn't even eat them and they didn't even offer to replace them. On the bright side the waitress and staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"I really liked this spot! Not only can you find a large selection of spicy rolls but they have no rice rolls too! We did AYCE and I didn't find a single items that I didn't like! The mussels, ice cream and sashimi selections were also awesome!
The servers are working hard to ensure that your visit is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I typically don't write a restaurant review until I have been to the location twice but I just can't help myself with this place... 

SO impressed by the quality at Sushi Hero and I can honestly say that it was some of the best sushi I have ever had, especially in Las Vegas. The service is prompt and efficient too, especially when partaking in AYCE ($27.00, whole menu). 
The vibe is super casual with good music (along with a TV playing sports) and you can tell the chefs and employees are having fun while at work, which makes a good vibe for customers. 

We had been on the hunt for a while to find a new regular sushi spot and I am SO glad I checked this place out on Yelp, so thanks Yelpers!

One thing I really enjoyed about our dinner at Sushi Hero is that the rolls are thick with fish, NOT rice (that can be hard to find, especially in LV)! Try the Playboy Roll and either of the Hand Rolls- incredible! Oh Ya, and the Red Bean ice cream too..yummm. 

Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best selection I have ever seen for an all you can eat sushi menu. They have only a few restricted items (one per customer) and you wouldn't even see these at other sushi places. This will be our go to place if we want to pig out on all you can eat sushi from now on.

We ordered so much it's hard to know we're to start. Everything was great. In particular I loved they have sushi burritos on the menu. I tried the bulgogi burrito and feel in love with it. I also liked the smaller size so it didn't feel me up and left plenty of room to try other things.

The chef (possible owner) also came to the table with some extra sushi dishes we didn't order. He said he likes to make special dishes every day for the customers. It was a nice touch and every member of the staff was very friendly.

The price is the typical $27 that seems the standard price for all you can eat sushi. For the quality and selection I highly recommend spending your money here over any of the other sushi places on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Was skeptical of the reviews, but this place lived up to the hype! I love the fact that they have SO many rolls to choose from and the portions are generous. Each roll we got was delicious and the chef was so fun."}
{"text":"This place was good. The service was handled by one waitress but portions were perfect, you can order half orders of most rolls, not huge. It is decent place for sushi. Take your time to look over the menu and you will find some of the names of the rolls are hilarious."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi spot and chefs in east Vegas.  Choo Choo makes the coolest and tastiest stuff on the fly. If they offer to make you something special you better always say yes!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest. They're menu is pretty extensive so you'd think something as simple as raw oysters would be on there. But no, they have deep fried oysters.. so how about you just don't deep fry mine? Put a little seasoning on it and serve. Should be that easy if it were \"fresh\" right? Their sweet shrimp sucks, they drenched it with ponzu/soy sauce so it took away flavor from the actual shrimp... and they don't give you the fried shrimp head. To top it off the service was subpar... yes, thanks for remembering our rolls but you forgot our drink order.  Their specialty rolls are good which is the reason for 2 stars. But nothing \"heroic\" about this place when you can't get the basics down."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday & not much people were inside when I went. Sushi here is small compared back home in Hawaii but overall, it's still good. You can do ala cart or all you can eat. You're best bet is to do the all you can eat just incase if you order ala cart and want something else to eat, you might be ending up paying more than the all you can eat price which is about $26. The only thing is that the service to receive the sushi is very slow. The second time I ordered ebi nigiri, I waited about let's say 10 or so minutes. I just wanted to leave since they took long but I decided not to since I was with my boyfriend and our nephew. They also had a buy a roll get the other one half off. This place isn't so bad to spend about $57 for all you can eat sushi for two people only."}
{"text":"It was empty as soon as my husband & I walked in but towards the ending of our meal it started to get packed!!! & now I know why it got packed because this place is delicious!!! My cup never got empty. My waitress never let it go past the half way level. Service is awesome & food is awesome!!! I thought the all you can eat was a separate menu but it's all the same. The only difference is you have to pay for the drinks but it's only $2. Will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars because YES, it's very good sushi. Thick pieces of fish (nigiri) and the rolls that had eel sauce weren't DRENCHED with it, *which is something I personally like to compare to with other ayce sushi restaurants especially*. 
Now to why it's not 5.. The wifey and I went for dinner. And yes I know it'd obviously be busy- and I seen the two sushi chefs (other sushi chef was training probably) working very hard getting blasted with orders- but I paid close attention to the staffing.  I bring it up because no waiter/waitress actually CAME UP to us prior to being seated, and each time we wanted to order it was so hard to get one of them's attention because they don't look at you and they walk fast all around! 
So to bring up my point of the -1 star, 
It's really good sushi. But there was literally one younger girl as hostess, waitress AND cashier. One waitress, and one bus-person. With a room full of people. 
I just think they need more waitresses, and I'm sure they're still working out the kinks. 
Fantastic job with the delicious sushi, chef HERO."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and very tasty.  The staff is very friendly and the restaraunt is always clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi place in town.  Don't forget to ask for the choo choo special.  It's a super awesome roll.  I have eaten sushi at most places including business that are all hype and no quality like I heart sushi in henderson and others around town.  They have the blasting music with a beat or w/e and the quality and service is usually crap.  This place has a simple atmosphere it's small boutique like and out of all the places it's my top two and trust me when I say I have eaten at every sushi joint in town (there is alot actually) a couple are comparable quality wise but honestly not in price.  You either get super expensive non all you can eat and it's good but a 200 dollar bill for sushi isn't my cup of tea.  I grew up in Alaska and have fished deep sea and ocean most of my life.  I know quality of fish.  So far Sushi hero for me and my friends is as good as it gets in vegas.  If you want sushi for a fair price that is extremely consistent then go here be sure to do the AYCE order 4 rolls, and two of the chef specials.  There is also a few apps that are tasty such as the jalapeno app and some korean beef.  
These guys came from Jenga which used to be the biggest sushi place in town everyone was there that was anyone until is shutdown recently due to liquor licensing issues.  These guys were the ones that made it so famous there and they opened there own shop super glad they did."}
{"text":"I've never given a 1 star review before. But, I was so shocked at how I was treated here, I feel almost obligated to warn people. Quick background on me: I adore sushi and it is an experience me and my family truly enjoy. I am a waitress and several people in my family work in the service industry so we make sure to take care of our servers. Tipping over 20% and of course being beyond kind to them, leaving our table so clean it's practically ready to be re-sat, and making sure they know they are appreciated is how we dine out. I had been here a few times before and never had amazing service but it was average and I enjoyed the sushi enough so I decided to bring my family by. I called ahead of time to ensure a group of 10 wouldn't be an inconvenience and we were good to go. We arrived and let the server know the majority of us would be eating AYCE and we were ready to order. I'm not sure why we didn't even have any menus and the server walked around us with no sense of urgency as we had to get her attention and ask for them but here we go. I began to order and when I asked for 4 rolls, she looked at me and questioned if I really wanted 4..and I said yes...and I went on to continue our order and she continued questioning the quantities I was ordering. Mind you, there were 10 of us. Just about every time we ordered, there was a question and a look of annoyance with what we were ordering. Everytime I ordered, I was polite and tried to look beyond her attitude. She would address me like I was an idiot who has never ordered sushi before to the point where I had to reaffirm to her that I have had sushi before. Ironically, she even messed up on one of our orders and put it in twice. At one point while I was ordering, she seems annoyed and says \"Wow! You guys can really put them away!\" And I responded jokingly, \"well there is 10 of us\" And she turned away and said, \"I've never seen anything like this before\" with a sense of pure disgust! We couldn't believe it! She seemed so bothered by every order..you would have thought we were disgusting pigs when ironically we are all in pretty great physical shape and have awesome mannerisms. As we were leaving she even complimented me on my toned arms and said she wants to workout more but then said she's \"too pale\" for that. I'm not sure what that even meant. She still received an 18% tip only because it was auto grat but had she even been an average server she would have made over 20% off our check which was around $250. My family was offended but we didn't complain to anyone about her..we just got the hell out and will absolutely never be returning or referring anyone there. As I mentioned, we work in the service industry and are always asked for recommendations and this place will definitely not be on that list. I've never been treated this way when dining out before and still can't believe that happened. The server we had should consider a different occupation because she seemed miserable."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday on a Thursday night. This was our second time here and it is still pretty empty. I don't like sushi much but I do like all of their options for appetizers and I do get some deep fried stuff. Everything I have eaten has been great. A lot of variety and even sushi burritos! Since there was hardly anyone there we got all of the attention and got the food right away."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here and what a selection!  The waitress was good.  This place is tucked away next to a Smiths market but don't let that turn you away.  I read the reviews and we gave it a go.. so glad we did! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited this sushi place was so close and had a lot of great reviews. When we went in it was empty and that should of been a sign. We tried the all you can eat but after one roll my boyfriend was done and wanted to go pay for another all you can eat. I wouldn't consider myself a sushi snob but this was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant. Doesn't look like anything special from the facade but indoors it is stylish little place with the usual bar and normal sitting tables. 
I ordered seared salmon sushi and an unagi roll with hot green tea. Both were pretty light on the rice compared to other AYCE restaurants I've been to (which is a plus, usually) and both were delicious. The server and sushi chefs were very friendly, and it was a pleasure to eat there."}
{"text":"I feel shame - a deep glutinous shame. I sore off all you can eat sushi for the pounds of girth it packs on you. I thought I found the answer- no rice rolls and sushi with minimum rice, but you just have to sample the other interesting offerings don't you?

We started off with miso soup and the spicy garlic edamame, both were good starters. We moved on to the fried oysters, jalapeño poppers, baked mussels, bacon and scallop skewers all were delicious.
 
We then turned our attention to the no rice rolls. Each one was unique and flavorful, we had the mellow Freshman Roll, the spicy flamingo Roll both were wrapped in rice paper and both were very tasty.  The Sushi Nacho was a different and creative savory item.  The TNT Roll was spicy, deep fried and deliciously naughty.

The regular rice based rolls were excellent as well, we sampled, I mean devoured the Burning Your Stomach Roll and the Kiss of Fire, both fantastic but you must have a Teflon tongue to handle the Burning Your Stomach Roll - it lit me up like the Forth of July! - I would and will do it again. The I Love My Ass and Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend were fun to order and delicious as well.

I think that's all we sampled, we had saki bombs also. We finished everything off with green tea and tempura ice cream cool and tasty. Service was excellent, with all the rules attached to all you can eat, the staff was attentive and flexible."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi places that I've been to great service the quality of fish is amazing"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover! This unlikely hole in the wall sushi restaurant is worth going to. I was skeptic even after the good reviews I read because of where it's at, but then again I am a regular at a sushi restaurant located on Boulder Highway. I tried and they did not disappoint! Sushi chefs took the challenge because I'm really worried. 

All you can eat price is typical, but their choices are better than what I've seen before! They have riceless selection and their apps are tasty (try the beef bulgogi and garlic edamame). I don't remember what we ordered but they are all so good! 

Chefs are amazingly skilled and staff are friendly. I will be sure to be back and this might be our regular go to."}
{"text":"Great service great food fast and average priced, 
What more can you ask for, one extra we got as it's walking distance from home , Nice selection of rolls Miso soup is very good.
Great location easy parking, right next to Smith's
We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! Restaurant was very clean. Lucy was our waitress and she did exceptional refilling our drinks and asking us if  needed anything else! Food was absolutely delicious and came out nice and hot and pretty quickly too! We would totally recommend this place! Overall, prices were reasonable and the service was awesome! What a great choice we made!!"}
{"text":"It is a neat little place. Food was great. Really liked the riceless rolls. The staffs was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow this sushi place is really good. I was skeptical at first with being in a ran sacked strip mall but man this place has good sushi. Fish to rice ratio was perfect. Huge pieces of meat. Service was great too. Must try for Vegas locals."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, well, once. The first time was when this location was \"Hello Tokyo\" I loved the sushi they had, was delicious, comparable to my usual go to place. 

The second time I ate here, was when it turned into Sushi Hero. The sushi wasn't bad, but it just wasn't the same. The price is pretty high compared to other all you can eat sushi places. To make up for that, they carry a stamp card, so we can at least get a free meal every once in a while. The other upside, or maybe downside depending on who you are, they place was completely empty during lunch time. Makes me worry about how long the business will last."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today and it was great! I had the \"I love sushi roll\" and it didn't disappoint! The sushi here is excellent quality and fresh. It is prepared and presented well. Service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant was super clean. What I also really liked is that you get a lot of fish and not just a bunch of rice. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Perfect flavor of sushi and presentation...how a sushi roll should be bite size ...the speed the rolls came out was very consistent. Price was okay since the fish served tasted and looked fresh portions were good ... sushi chef was friendly and attentive ... and recommendations he gave was terrific .. he suggested I try choo choo special best roll of the night tried the following rolls ..bam bam (good) jackpot ( good), double D (good),something wrong 69( great )choo choo roll ( my favorite awesome) dessert was deep fried vanilla ice cream excellent ending to my dining experience ... hope this place lasts since I love sushi and very few good places keep quality going"}
{"text":"The rolls were ok, place was clean and presentable. But the customer service was real poor. First it took to long to get our waters after being seated. Then I had to keep raising my hand to get her attention (mind you the place was not packed at all, bout 6-8 ppl total which equal 2 families in 2 booths) then when I got it it was like she was in a rush. Then asked her to get us some napkins, she forgot had to ask her again smh. Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Great food, but very slow service. They could be better if their female server will pay more attention to the people."}
{"text":"Very nice. Servers were great! Food was delicious. Will come here often. One of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas, so trying to find our local spots has been a little tough. But boy did we score with little gem. Not only is the food Amazing the service is just as amazing! We will definitely be back! Found our favorite sushi  spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot, quick and friendly service with high quality sushi rolls. They could use a chopstick upgrade but other than that I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"So we were looking for a little place closer to home to introduce 2 of our 3 boys to sushi (the third is a solid no go in regard to almost any food except ramen in a cup and grilled cheese.) I located Sushi Hero on Yelp, read the reviews and away we went!

The restaurant was inviting as soon as we stepped inside. Clean with bold vibrant sushi cartoon graphics on the wall. Perfect place for a newcomer to sushi!

We ordered salmon sashimi (my personal favorite), a dragon roll for my boyfriend, a golden Philadelphia for everyone and the boys (age 6 and 9) requested two California rolls and a spicy salmon roll.

Everything was a hit! Our waiter was great, our food was amazing and the kids are now full sushi converts! I will say the golden (fried) Philadelphia could quickly become one of my favorites to vie with sashimi!

Definitely pop in and try this place out!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!!! Always friendly when I call to place my order. I have never had to wait for my food always ready when they say it will be. The take taste like my ex is the bomb!!!! I always get it with green onion added and love the fact that they know exactly who I am when I ask!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! This is gonna be our go-to sushi place when we are craving for sushi. I love the atmosphere inside as well as the chefs and servers. Nigiri sushi were fresh and delicious. I also loved that you could order half roll instead of the full roll. Would recommended this to anyone and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best place! Even tho it is in my hood, I would travel to eat here. Fantastic service as well. T"}
{"text":"The portion sizes are generous. Go figure since most restaurants have all you can eat sushi right? But the serving size of fish is a lot compared to other restaurants I've dined at around town. I also ordered the poke bowl lunch special $14.95 for take out and the amount of fish was heaping and very tasty! Hidden treasure, next to Smiths. Lots of parking and never waited to be seated when I got there."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Great quality fish, super friendly and helpful staff. My wife and I will definitely be coming back for our next date night."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, so nice to have something so close. The food was great, affordable, and the service was the best. Will be going here a lot."}
{"text":"We have a new sushi house! 

Fast service, clean facility, and plenty of tasty choices! 

I have been here twice in the past week because I've enjoyed it so much. Give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I've been here several times and it's a great AYCE spot. The sashimi salad is incredible and they do a few items with yuzu which I love. Another plus is that they do half rolls so you get to try more variety. ChoCho is amazing at what he does and Eli our server is incredible!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply amazing for an All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant and here's why.

Small Portions - Sounds like a bad thing but it's amazing when you think about all of the different offerings you want to try.  The nigiri is small, but the fish to sushi rice ratio is on point.  Rolls are typically six pieces instead of eight, and appetizers are small enough to not get you full too quickly.

Fast Service - While the service is not exactly perfect, the food gets prepared quickly and the appropriate amount of attention is given during a busy lunch or dinner period.

Food Quality - There's no doubt about the quality of the food here.  I've been here at least three separate times and I can honestly say, for Las Vegas, this is one of the best places outside of the strip.  No need to drown your sushi in soy sauce and wasabi here, everything is good as is if you want to really taste it all.  Non-sushi items are decent, but I'm hoping you didn't think about coming here for anything but the sushi."}
