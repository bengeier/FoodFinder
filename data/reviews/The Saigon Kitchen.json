{"text":"New management, better experience... the waitresses are much nicer, the restaurant much cleaner. They renovated so it looks brand new. And the food much better in taste.

When I found out the restaurant was under construction and changing management I waited to see how it looked before I tried it. I saw that it was brand new people and staff and I was excited to try this place. Saigon kitchen has became my weekend routine. I do my groceries and such and stop by here to have something almost every weekend, at least 2 weekends in a month. 

 I have been waiting for the name to change on yelp to Saigon kitchen so that I could update my review and today I finally remembered to check !!! 

I really hope this restaurant stays around because they truly have better management now."}
{"text":"Very good place. At first I was skeptical due to how it looked on the outside but it is a very good and small area to get a Vietnamese/Thai food. I recommend the Pho, the soup is really good."}
{"text":"After work rainy day it the best eating hot soup. So choose to get nice bowl of soup near my home. Small plaza with plenty of parking.
Soon you get inside, you get greeting from the waitress and seat where you like. Clean, quiet and friendly atmosphere. 
Not take long your food arrived...the taste is clean seem the msg not killing your throat. 
I believe I find my fix place if I would like to have bowl of soup!"}
