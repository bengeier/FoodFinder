{"text":"I hesitate to write this review because I know it will only be fuelling the hype train that I can already see is on the way. This is exactly the kind of place that gets featured on BlogTO to feed the zombie foodie hordes - casual ambience, great selection of a variety of food, good value for pretty good food. But I will stop being selfish. Here's the review:  This complex is actually a 5-in-1 food court - Sushi Burrito/Poke Bowl, Chinese wonton noodle stand, Taiwanese fried chicken (think Hot Star), Japanese Crepe, and Bubble tea. We had a couple sushi burritos, the spicy salmon ($11.99) and the grilled mango chicken ($8.99). I was really impressed by the chicken one - it was seasoned like a Taiwanese fried chicken. The salmon was average but I still liked it. For value, go with the chicken options.   There is seating for approximately 32 people (8 tables of 4) and they play some Kpop music on the tv, nice background and not overpowering. The service was very good. They have a couple intro specials - come before Jan 31st and get a free pop with your order. Like on Facebook for a free small fries.   So like I said earlier, get here while it's still pretty calm. Pretty soon BlogTO will sink its claws in and the horde will descend. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wonton noodle for takeout. The wait time was around 15-20 minutes which is about the normal wait time since they cooked the wonton fresh. I like the bright colour and  open kitchen concept because you can see what they are doing.   However, here is the downside, I see WHAT they are doing. There were 3 staffs: one in his twenty, one men and women in their forty. They seem unorganized when there is only 3 orders of noodle, me and two other ppl's order. The guy in his twenty doesn't seem like he know what he is doing and the guy in forty keep ordering him what to do. I overheard the two older staff complaint the young staff put too much beef in one of the order \"he put 4 servings worth of beef!!\" . For my noodle, he use his BARE hand to separate the noodle and put into boiling water. Yes bare head after he handled the tilt with money. What's worst is he pour my noodle into the takeout container after it's done, and then he use chopstick and took two bite size of noodle from my bowl to a larger bowl on the counter. Why would u do that? 2 bite size worth of noodle!!?? And where is this communal bowl going to? His stomach or another customer later? So I guess the size of order depends on which staff handle ur food. Portion was enough for me but doesn't get me full. For a guy it will definitely not be enough.   In terms of the food, shrimp wonton was good, good mixture of shrimp and pork. However, the broth is as bland as water, for the price of $6.95 I would rather go to congee time which is within driving distance because you get 5 wonton for $5.50 instead of 4 for $6.95 at this place. In congee time, I can request beef broth for free but here he said I have to order beef and wonton noodle in order to get the beef broth.   I would not come back to get the noodle again. I can't comment on the other food booth there until I try it. However it's the same staff that handled all 5 stalls so if I see the same staff again I might walk back out."}
{"text":"Basically a really small food court.  Put in your order at the front till (by the crepe stall), and take your pick from one of four stall options.  Skip the pork rice roll, which are a couple bland, mushy plain rice rolls with minced pork on top rather than rolled inside.  The wonton noodles are served with four large, shrimp dumplings, but are standard in terms of taste. I found the Taiwanese chicken to be bland, and I would definitely recommend that other place *starring* Taiwanese large, fried chicken, instead of Mega Street Food Complex, if y'know what I mean....  Table seating is a bit tight when the places is full on the weekend, and if you ever want to get up to refill your drink, get condiments or napkins, etc. you'd basically have to ask every person in your row to get up from their seats to squeeze on by."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon salad bowl and it was AMAZING! There's parking close-by and it's not expensive! The customer service was excellent, making this a regular for me!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have many different food such as sushi burrito, Taiwan popcorn chicken, wonton noodle, bento box, bubble tea, crepes and many more! The shop is super clean and with lots of seating area, customer service was A+! I tried their popcorn chicken, bubble tea and steamed rice noodle rolls with pork, super tasty and big portion! Will definitely come by next time to try their bento box!"}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon for a quick snack at 3:30 pm. Order Shrimp wanton noodle. Was very surprise with the quality of the wantons. Fill with shrimps and very tasty. Will return for shrimp rice roll."}
{"text":"Finally a Chinese food court style eatery has arrived in the north York area!  Though the cuisine is not necessarily all Chinese , this place has 5 different types of offerings under one roof, and is operated by a Chinese owner.  There's fried chicken, wonton soup, handmade  boba bubble tea, sushi, and crepes.   We tried the fried chicken Bento and the shrimp wonton soup without noodles. Both were very good!  The Fried chicken was prepared Taiwanese style and was very crispy on the outside. The rice in the Bento box was sushi rice and was equally addicting.   The shrimp wonton soup had 5 jumbo wontons inside. Inside the wontons there were 4-5 baby shrimps inside, and in general they tasted juicy and fresh. The owners said all their cuisine is handmade.   I look forward to coming back to try their poke bowls, bubble tea and crepes !"}
{"text":"Interesting idea to have 4-5 different stalls in owned by same owner under one roof. Only problem I have that it is pretty small seating area.  They had wonton noodles, poke bowls, bubble tea, crepes, Japanese bento.  We got the Wanton noodle where the wonton was good but the noodles were over cooked and mushy.  2/5.  I also got the Japanese chicken cutlet bento which comes with a free drink.  The portion is very good around 4-5 pieces of chicken.  But the sides were a litle shady.  Looks like can pineapple and some veggie that looks old. 4/5  If you like their page on facebook you will also get a free small fries."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place that I've ever been to for asain food, EVER. Mega Street Food is a 5-in-one restaurant, it serves; Wonton noodle soup, Fried chicken, bubble tea, sushi burritos, and crepes.                                About the restaurant        The restaurant is located on Yonge Street, Toronto in an asaian-dominated part of downtown Toronto. The building is right next to the popular restaurant-bar and it also is conveniently beside a convince store. I've actually walked past this place before it turned into to a restaurant and believe it or not, this place used to be a dentist's office!!! I actually also recognized the guy working there, Jackie Zhao, who also owns TWO bubble tea stores at CNE.                                   Atmosphere           The place has a warm, modern feel to it which is good! There's significant lighting in this place, and there's a tv that plays K-pop and Asian music. The employees are nice and friendly and try their best to give you the best experience possible in this place. Which is exactly what I call amazing service!!                            Hours and other Info"}
{"text":"Just ok food. Lots of seating though. Big menu and lots of options. The service was friendly and they gave us a free pop."}
{"text":"Five different brands here, all focused on Taiwanese style snacks, drinks, and meals.   They have two cashiers which suggests they might have two lines going during busy hours. Not too many tables though, as half the space is used for the kitchen.  Ordered the original XL fried chicken and plain wonton soup. They cut the chicken up for you if you're dining in, which makes it easier to share instead of a giant slab. It was crispy, but the meat was a bit dry.  The plain wonton soup came with 5 pieces of wonton, compared to the wonton noodle soup that comes with 4. It costs an extra dollar to get the bowl without noodles, so if you're looking to get shrimp wontons you've got a choice to make.  The wontons are quite large. They stuff two small pieces of shrimp with fish paste or something. Sometimes the shrimp isn't cleaned properly, so check before you take a bite if that concerns you. Soup was light in flavor, which I prefer.  The prices are not bad for the area, depending on what you get. They've got a lot of options to cater to different preferences, so it's a pretty good place to drop by whether you're a group or dining solo."}
{"text":"An Asian place called mega street food complex definitely got me excited. I visited the website and learned that it's a place with 1) wonton noodles 2) bubble tea 3) large fried chicken 4) japanese style crepe 5) sushi. Based on what I tried, this place is not worth the very short trip from my house.  You can rightfully suspect that a place doing 5 things with 1 owner, would turn out flawed. Me and my brother ordered 1 beef brisket noodle, 1 shrimp wonton noodle, and 1 Schezuan spicy fried chicken. Everything was underwhelming...  I might be spoiled by gems like Jim Chai Kee that specialize in Wonton Noodles. This place is a far cry from JCK. The egg noodles here don't have that bouncy texture. The beef brisket I had were slightly tough, and not that many pieces. The broth lacked the flavor I was expecting. And the fried chicken was horrible. It had no taste. Did they forget to even add salt?  The cashier obviously is not fluent in English. We ordered Schezuan fried chicken and got the original. It was a struggle to even communicate our order to the cashier.  The owner seems nice though, gave us free pop, which seems to be a grand opening promo.  I might give their crepes a try. That one should be harder to screw up in terms of taste as all the toppings and ice cream should be pre-made. Just a question of assembly. But I don't recommend their hot foods based on this visit."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place as it range from fried chicken to wonton noodle to poke bowls. But after observing it is owned by the same owner.   I've ordered the shrimp rice roll. The rice roll was a bit too moist. But the shrimp was large. Moving on to the wonton noodle, I've asked  them to mix the dumpling and wonton. Both tasted good and a good size. I didn't like the noodle as I find it too soft. But it is convenient, I will come back to try other items on the menu.   I came back again on a weeknight and ordered the wonton again and fried chicken. I find the wonton didn't taste as good as my first visit and the fried chicken the batter didn't taste dry enough. I will see come back as it is convenient but hopefully the wonton flavour improves."}
{"text":"There are so many Asian eateries in this neighbourhood that it's hard to decide which one to enter but am I ever glad we looked on Yelp, read the great reviews and walked into this place. It looks a bit like a Baskin Robbins ice cream parlour and the ambience is definitely fast food, but it works for what they serve. It's brand new, less than one month old, and run by a very helpful and friendly staff who make everything to order so it's hot and fresh. We ordered the chicken nugget bento and chicken nugget poutine. I was worried the nuggets would be reconstituted ground up chicken but they were actually whole chunks of fresh chicken and the crispy outside was perfectly done. The bento box was a very sizeable portion (and comes with a free pop!), and the fries and real cheese curds on the poutine were great. There was also some sort of topping drizzled on top of the poutine, sort of like sesame seeds, which was a nice touch. Only wish the poutine gravy was a bit saltier (it was an Asian gravy that had a bit of sweetness to it), and that the cheese curds melted into the poutine which they somehow didn't even though the fries and gravy were nice and hot, but all in all we were very happy with our meals and will come back to try the sushi burrito/poke bowl, noodle soup and rice rolls. The table beside us had the spicy sliced beef rice roll and it looked scrumptious! Be sure to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 star joint. They have a variety of foods all in one spot. It reminded me of the eatery in Galleria Supermarket, except the employees aren't working for the same restaurant. You have one fried chicken place, one sushi burrito/poke bowl/bento box place, a bubble tea spot, wonton noodles, and a crepe place.   I have to give props for the workers because it can get SO busy. We arrived at noon, just before the lunch time rush and a few of the tables were occupied. They've got approximately seating for 30 people. The older gentleman serving everyone was super friendly and it's interesting to see a complex under one roof. It's like the CNE food building, but on a much smaller scale.   My boyfriend got a beef noodle soup, our friend got a wonton noodle soup and I ordered the salmon bowl. We also got a fried chicken to share (which came with a free pop). It's a large chicken breast that's seasoned Taiwanese style and fried to a crisp, golden brown with a great crunch. I didn't really enjoy my spicy salmon bowl on account of there being too much sauce, but the toppings were plentiful and everything was fresh. It had: salad mix, mangos, a bit of seaweed salad, sliced radish and large cubes of salmon.   I'm mad at myself for not getting the spicy mayonnaise with the fried chicken *kicks dirt* Will be back for the crepe. Happy they opened this around the Yonge/Finch area as there isn't a one stop shop for Asian food for the employees of the office buildings nearby.   Debit/credit/cash accepted :)"}
{"text":"A great place filled with a variety of foods. Contains sushi burrito, poke bowls, bubble tea, fried chicken and Ben to boxes! You get a good portion for a very decent price. I'd come back whenever I'm in the area. Very fresh ingredients but small staff so you can expect a little bit of a wait time if it does get busy tho."}
{"text":"Large chicken was really really large and they cut it up for you. Very flavorful and came with a drink too for about $10 plus tax. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We went there again on 27 May 2018 and we both had the Pork Rice Roll.  It was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Had the kimchi beef rice rolls. The kimchi was way too strong with fermentation taste and overpowered the whole dish. The beef was pure fat - very low quality meat. The rolls themselves were very fresh and had a nice texture. If I were to order again, I'd go for plain rice rolls with soy sauce.  Boyfriend had the fried chicken bento which he liked - the breading was very flavourful. Nothing much else to say about the rest of the dish (i.e. the rice, salad, canned corn, and canned pineapple). OK for $10.99.  The service was efficient and friendly enough. Washrooms were clean. Decent amount of seating despite the small space."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Friendly owners.  Nice staff in general.  The cooking area seems clean, but the seating area was pretty dirty.  Food ===== We ordered Deep Fried Chicken Bento and Salmon Burrito.  And also order two drink: Signature Milky Black Milk Tea w/ Tapioca & Kumquat Green tea.  Deep Fried Chicken: This was delicious!  The chicken was seasoned perfectly, super crunchy--reminded me of Lohas Cafe in Markham.  Bento Salmon Burrito: Good but I wouldn't get it again.  There are places with much better Japanese/Poburritos.   Bubble Tea: Tea flavour was good.  They use milk powder which I don't personally like but that's just a preference.  BUT the tea was not prepared correctly.  The ice was practically all melted but the time the drink was served and it wasn't even cold.  They probably used too little ice or the tea was wayyyyy too hot going in,  Either way it made for a watery, luke warm, bubble tea.  Tapioca was also falling apart :/...  Would I come back? =============== YES!  But for their fried chicken & take-out only.  Seriously it's some yummy chicken."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this food court style restaurant, located on the north-east corner of Yonge and Finch. Firstly, their service was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered their sushi burrito, rice roll, popcorn chicken (chicken nuggets), and a bubble tea.  Their spicy salmon sushi burrito was fresh and tasty, but not quite at the level of M'hito or Rolltation. However, for the price and convenience, this is a great order. They had various sauces and toppings for the burrito, including avocado, tobiko, spinach, and many others.  Their rice roll was better than expected. Very soft and tender, I would definitely order this again.  Popcorn chicken (called chicken nuggets on their menu, but it's actually Taiwanese style popcorn chicken) was a hit. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and flavourful throughout. I'd recommend this any day.  Lastly, their bubble tea was a bit too bland for my taste.. as in the tea taste wasn't strong enough. I also ordered mine without ice so it wasn't watered down either. Well, in Cantonese, it is \"tam tay day\" (kind of bland) so it feels healthier to drink lol.  You may need to find street parking if you're driving here, but there is free parking on the street on Yonge after 9pm on weeknights.  I really like this place. The idea of having separate food stations, each with their own brand identity, and ordering whatever you like from the cashier offers great variety and convenience. It also helps that they offer foods that my wife and I generally enjoy (rice rolls, sushi burritos, popcorn chicken, bbt)... and they also have a Japanese crepe station which I'll try next time."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the exterior. This is a mini food court and they got great prices seldom seen in this location. They serve a variety of popular foods like sushi burrito, poke bowls, taiwanese fried chicken, and Japanese crepes. It's made to order so the quality is better than the usual food court.  I love the variety because even for picky people there will be some option they can eat. The ambience is quiet but always with some customers. It's definitely more of a take out or quick lunch place.  I like the owners and servers here. They seem to be good people. Yes they serve fast food but with a homemade style."}
{"text":"Visited Mega Street Food Complex around 7pm on a Saturday night and it was fairly quiet, only 2 other tables in the entire place. My friends and I all ordered crepes. Unfortunately we were informed that they did not have any ice cream that night so we just ordered the non-ice cream versions instead. I got the apple cinnamon crepe. It took about 10 mins for each of us to get our food and the crepes were much larger than we had expected and well worth the price. My apple cinnamon crepe was quite tasty as there was a good ratio of apples to cream.  I'll definitely be back to try some of the other food options as the fried chicken and bento boxes looked really good.  The only thing I didn't really like about my experience was the excessive use of plastic utensils and Styrofoam containers. While good for takeout, it would have been nice to have actual plates and cutlery for dine-in customers to help cut back on waste."}
{"text":"Decent food, generous portions at fair prices. A very large assortment of diverse foods, from Chinese noodles to bubble tea to fried chicken to desserts to poke bowls to sushi burrito rolls. Albeit not the best per selection but the value is definitely good enough for me to come back. Personal favourite so far is the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Went in to lunch on a Friday.  Lots of options and no line ups to order! However, I waited 45 mins for my order and it wasn't what i ordered.  Owner tried to compensate with a free pop...(which was free for any customers anyways). Poorly organized process and staff were incompetent to understand that orders should be done on a first come first serve basis. After 45 mins, I decided to ask for a refund and was offered the wrong order to compensate...  I didn't have time to argue for $6 back so just took it and left.   I do like the variety of options but can't wait 45 mins for an order.   FYI the rice roll I got was terrible... it was in the steamer too long  My colleagues ordered fried chicken and wonton noodles and they were dry and bland as well.   My recommendations.... give them some time to work out the kinks...."}
{"text":"Sold as a food court -- but it's not a really a food court.  Think of it as like a self-serve counter where they have separately branded portions of a large menu.  You order everything from one till and the person making your noodle soup, may be making a poke bowl on the next order.  So if you're hoping for a 'food court' like you would find in Asia where each stall is operated by a separate specialist in their trade, you'll be disappointed.  It's more akin if you walked into Tim Horton's and you ordered a coffee off 'TH Coffee' menu, a chili bowl off 'Mama's Chili' menu and a donut off the 'Sweet Treats' menu.  So, points off for the misrepresentation.  It's mostly trendy food -- Taiwanese fried chicken, poke bowls/sushi buritto, 'Japanese crepe' (whatever that means) and bubble tea -- so it's not like you can't find it elsewhere in Yonge & Finch area.  In addition, if you're looking for a Asian food court experience, you can do better if you went to that food court at the bottom of the condos @ Yonge & Sheppard (which has Allwyn's, HCafe and a bunch of random Asian stalls).  However, they do have a menu for Cantonese staples like wonton noodle soup and rice rolls - which is sorely lacking in the area.  I typically drive out to Markham or Scarborough for my fix and was hoping to find somewhere closer.  Pass on the rice rolls - although it's fresh made and street style (it's not like the dim sum version), it's not close to a specialist joint like Yin Ji Chang Fen.  I had beef on my rice rolls ($5)  and the beefs chunks were too large and grainy.    The beef brisket and wonton noodle soup ($10) was OK.  Nothing too much to complain about and you get 2 large wontons and a lot of beef brisket for the money.  The noodles were probably too thin or overcooked.   Obviously, it's not close to what Jim Chai Kee or Wonton Chai can offer -- but it's a lot closer to the city and transit.  The lady had a poke bowl and it was a good portion -- nothing much to say, other than they were heavy on the mayo.  Overall, it's not bad - it's solid value and convenient.  For the wonton noodle soup alone, it's a solid addition to the area.  However, it is a bit tilting for misrepresenting itself as a 'food court'."}
{"text":"We're a family of opinionated stubborn-headed four. Normally we have a system: we take turns to decide what to eat. It works and keeps everyone happy but isn't perfect because I'm stuck eating Korean fried chicken every week (partner's one true love), which I'm not a huge fan of. This is why we went to Mega Street Food Complex - Decent size portions, reasonably priced and the option for everyone in your party to order from a range of items. Food was fresh and taste was decent - not exceptional. Ordered beef brisket with noodle, beef brisket bento, spicy salmon poke bowl, fried chicken bento. Not so bad to drop in if you're nearby. Don't just come here for the food though-each of the items found on the menu are done better elsewhere. The service is really what sets this place apart: We ordered 'extra spicy' fried chicken & ended up with mild. Told the guy behind the counter & he must have apologized a hundred times. He quickly got us a HUGE box of extra fried chicken (far more than the original bento had) & said we should keep the original bento (gave us a box so we could take it home). We ended up with a LOT of fried chicken, my friends. He was still apologizing at the end of the night as we walked out the door."}
{"text":"Perfect 5/5.   Seeing a store with 5 tiny speciality stores combined (sushi burrito/poke/salad, noodle soups/dim sum, bubble tea, Fried chicken, and japanese crepe) run by a 2 person crew had me drop my jaw.   We ordered the chicken nugget bento box and the salmon burrito.  The Chicken nugget bento came first and it comes with a respectable portion of fried chicken that tasted very juicy and tender on the inside. The outside was covered with a satisfying crunch in every bite. I would definitely order again. I really liked the attention to detail and how there was some seaweed seasoning on top of the rice and some vegetables and sliced mangos. This dish tasted really good with the hot sauce on the side when I asked. The server was very kind to offer this for me.  The sushi burrito came a bit later but it was top notch as well. Great combination and portions when I shared it with my partner. We liked that there were corn and crabmeat but part of me wished there were some avocados too. But overall it was nicely wrapped and tasted great. I dont think there is another joint in this neighbourhood right now that offers sushi burritos! (correct me if I am wrong)  Anyways we will definately be coming back and I hope this place doesnt get too popular as I know (as per the review below) that blogTO will definitely pick up on this and the lines here will get crazy. Best of luck Mega!  Note that until Jan 31st 2018, you can get 1 free pop with visit ! Free is good :D"}
{"text":"Great place for a snack or meal. This is sort of like a food court-style fast food joint. It has several different types of restaurants in one place (i.e., wonton noodles sushi burrito, Taiwanese fried chicken, bubble tea and Japanese crepes). The service is good and friendly but it takes a little while for the food to be prepared. If you want a quick lunch meal, I'd suggest to call ahead.  The salmon sushi burrito was okay but not a huge fan of so much lettuce in my sushi burrito and would have liked more flavour and avocado.  The wonton soup had large wontons and quite legit like HK-style.  I'd order it again! Their squid tentacles are crispy and comes with tasty Sriracha mayo.  Beef brisket is good and their large fried chicken also very good. I hope this place sticks around as it has a good variety of options and there aren't many wonton soup places around the neighbourhood. If you come here, you're bound to find something you'll enjoy.  All in all, I'll be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Good place to go with a group of friends if youre indecisive about what to eat.  Lots of options.  Only two staff working behind the counter when i went.  Tried the chicken steak and some noodles. Nothing great but good in a pinch when everyones indecisive"}
{"text":"Would rate 4.5/5 stars, but giving it a slight bump because the owners are a such friendly bunch.  We've been to this place many times for dine-in as well as take-out. The food is delicious, and they try their best to get your food ready ASAP. My favourites include the spicy salmon burrito roll, Taiwanese fried chicken, and the shrimp wonton noodle soup (you only get about 4 wontons for $7, but each wonton is huge, containing 4-5 pieces of shrimp). Also there's the option to get poke bowls or sushi salad bowls rather than sushi burritos if you wanna be extra healthy and skip the rice! These bowl portions are pretty generous and filling.  Will definitely come back and try the crepes/dessert menu items when it gets warmer..."}
{"text":"I normally don't write a review for a restaurant, however this Mega Street ,,,,is so good and unique , We  already visited this restaurant 4 times in the last 2 weeks even we live quite far away...My family like the variety of food under the same roof,   From chinese Wonton to Sushi Burrito ,each type of food is so unique as well.  one of my favorite is the wonton noodle..., this is not a ordinarily  wonton , this a very tasty jumbo size with fresh yummy shrimp ...inside, for sure  better than many speciality wonton noodle place in Toronto and Hong Kong,   My other favour is Sushi Burrito. What a great idea !!! we like this  better than  japanese hand roll,  because I can choose so many different type of fresh ingredients, in addition, there are numbers of house special sauces  which makes it taste even better.  We also love their their Taiwanese fried Chicken, it is so  crispy on the outside, tender Inside, I just can't stop eating it until I finish the whole thing.  ....  My wife and daughter love their Japanese Crepe with ice-cream, it is so yummy and  my daughter like the character they created......  I believe the ice-cream is actually import from japan,  Another few reasons we like this place is because the sitting area is very clean and comfortable and price is very reasonable plus no need to pay tips :) We will try their bubble tea with unique flavours  tapioca next time."}
{"text":"This looks like a pretty brand new place, the place looks spic and span but the service is too slow. The workers, albeit very nice, moved at a snail speed and each food came out one at a time. For a Hong Kong style cafeteria place, that is unacceptable. But I will give this place a few months and hopefully the service will pick up. I hope it does well, it's a good concept and will compete with neighbouring restaurants if the service is faster and they continue churning out good food. There were like 4 different \"restaurants\" but in the same store/area: crepes, sushi burrito & poke, bubble tea, Taiwanese fried chicken and wonton soup & lo mein. There should have been more seating especially with people waiting so long for their order. There were 8-9 tables.   The food wasn't bad. We had the Kimchi XL fried chicken (9.99) and shrimp wonton soup (6.99). The prices are fair. The fried chicken was cooked decent (somewhat moist) but under seasoned. The crust was Taiwanese style and was crunchy. Didn't really get any kimchi flavour. They cooked to order so that's good. The shrimp wonton soup was decent. My husband is Chinese and I am not so I thought it was flavourful but he said it was standard, not that special. For the price, it's pretty good. Come with 4 big wontons, shrimp was cooked well and flavourful. The soup was good, standard broth and okay seasoned. I thought the noodles were fine but my husband said it wasn't that good and they were stuck together. That's kind of noodle soup 101, you gotta stir the noodles around! The old man that made it was super nice and sweet though.   I also had the hazelnut milk tea (4.99), not good. No black tea flavour. Tasted like almond milk but with hazelnut flavour and sugar. Another annoyance was it looks like each order was done one at a time so my bubble tea was made after the other dishes. This is very inefficient because there were at least 4 workers at each \"restaurant\" station but each order was made one at a time? They'll need to speed up or every customer would probably not come back.   Another note: I thought the workers, clearly new at the restaurant biz handled this one disgruntled customer well. I have no idea what was wrong but she had complaints and the employees were trying very hard to please her. Her english was terrible but she kept getting mad at the workers (whose english was bad too) for not understanding her. It looks like she ordered one dish and milk tea. Unless there was a hair in it or it was inedible, my goodness lady, just eat it or throw it out, why make such a fuss? It's such cheap food! She was also asking for an elastic band? I've never seen this at any other restaurant lol.   I'd come back because I like the concept, convenience and the food was decent. If the service doesn't pick up, it's doomed to fail regardless of the food is good!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the buzz is about with this new place but I just had their spicy salmon poke bowl and it was terrible. Very little salmon and lots of rice with hard cabbage shreds smothered in their mayo sauce.  If you want good poke bowl options, downtown Toronto is the only way to go otherwise you will regret it."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of food court/restaurants, food is great and authentic exactly like what I had in Asia, with reasonable prices. The best part is that you get such diverse food choices that incorporate different presentation skills giving off wide range of culinary experience. Top recommendations are the XL fried chicken bento and the chicken nuggets bento (tremendously nutritious, comes with healthy amount of veggies and fruits) cannot wait to try their crepes!!!"}
{"text":"Had Their crispy chicken bento and Singapore curry chicken bento.  Their Taiwanese chicken was soo good. Super crispy, authentic seasoning and juicy. The Singapore curry chicken was pretty good but could not hold a candle against the Taiwanese chicken. Also the portions of the Taiwanese chicken was like double that of the Singapore curry chicken. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be or if the server messed up. Anyway, I'm rating it 4/5 just for that Taiwanese chicken.. I can still taste it *drools*"}
