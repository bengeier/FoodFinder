{"text":"Zoiks, this was bad. I was the only one at the bar and the bartender said nothing to me for over 30 minutes (ignored me the one time I said anything just to break the silence). She is generally acceptable in the looks category so she's probably used to having that write her checks but she lost me immediately and I couldn't finish my one beer fast enough. I will say I REALLY liked the manager Dale. She was very cool and understanding about the bartender service issue. I'm confident she'll rectify the issue, so I added a star for that. Hopefully they improve and I'll come back.

Oh, and $8.25 for one pint is just too much. I went next door and got one for $5 afterward..."}
{"text":"It was my favourite place to hang out weekly till one fine Saturday evening when we were there and someone old a very funny joke. Apparently we laughed too loud so the assistant manager came over accusing my party of being drunk and cut us off . Never been so humiliated but the staff there are a class of their own. Three of them called me personally to apologies for the way we were treated . Will go back there just for the staff 
Good choice of beer and scotch . Just don't laugh too loud"}
{"text":"Beer selection is excellent and they will let you sample a couple if you ask so that you can decide on your choice. They also have a beer paddle with three options  so you can get creative.  Their whiskey options are also expansive and a nice list to find something new. 

The food is expensive and it is hit or miss on the quality.  
The colossal onion rings and wonton nachos are great appetizers,  crispy, and fun to share. Their steak dishes are also consistently good with great flavor and nice sides. 
Their burgers are mediocre at best.  Their fish and chips are greasy, The salads are ridiculously small for the price and their pasta is just plain bad and boring. 

I would go for drinks and appetizers with friends.  I won't bother with dinner items any more"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Beer Beer Beer and great food. Steak is awesome. Must go! Perfect service! Love it!"}
{"text":"If your the type of person that enjoys beer or whiskey, then Rib Eye Jack's is the place to go for a night out with the guys or gals.  The have a huge selection of mostly local beer from Ont. whether your looking for a light beer or a strong stout, they have it.  As for the whiskey drinkers, Rye or Scotch, they have a huge selection of that as well, so raise your glasses and enjoy your whiskey neat, on the rocks or mixed.  by the way their bananna bread pudding is a must try."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, their fries are absolutely the best. Great atmosphere and amazing service. This is the best destination in The GTA for Ontario craft beer outside of the core. The tap list is great, but it's their bottle list that truly shines. They do a great job of keeping the fridge full of one offs and other great beers that you can't find at the LCBO. The prices are steep, but you aren't going to get a lot of these beers unless you drive to the breweries yourself. Be sure to go on Thursday as they tap a fresh Cask every Thursday.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We've tried to like this place. We've given it 3 chances now. 
The pros: a great beer list and selection, and a great patio. That's it. 
Service is consistently slow.  It's expensive for not very good food. The rib eye I had was decent. But the burgers taste like they're from frozen. 
Also, the manager had all the warmth and charisma of laundered Kleenex. Maybe he was having an off day."}
{"text":"If you're craving a big delicious beefy burger cooked to your perfection head to Rib Eye's! Not only is their food great they have a vast array of craft beers from local and surrounding breweries.  Pair any beer to the food you want.

This is a great place for boys to have their beers and burgers or girls who are tired of salads and are craving a guilty pleasure of being a true foodie forgetting calories, carbs and waistlines and indulging in some really good comfort food.  The gym will always be there tomorrow....! :)

Service is friendly and knowledgeable if you don't know which beer to have the servers have recommendations they can suggest.  The best is the pricing is affordable and you get a great portion size...meaning...guys you won't be starving while watching a game; and girls...after indulging your inner-foodie and your plate isn't finished you can take it home.  I suggest trying it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So this place was recommended to us by a work friend, and they weren't wrong! 
They place was buzzing and the staff were very nice and mannerly and constantly making sure we were okay for drinks and never left waiting.. 
Nice menu to choose from, I had trouble ordering as there was a lot I wanted haha!
But I decided on the feta bruschetta to start and the quinoa sweet potato burger with mash! All in all, food was fresh and delicious and the staff always kept our table clean, either replacing drinks or removing empty plates (but not to the extent where it's annoying) and I also had a bikini martini (which would blow the socks off you) but it could have just been the type of vodka in it! Still drank it as it was yummy ;) 

They had a good selection of desserts too but I restrained myself (as I already gave myself diabetes from snacking at home earlier in the day) 

Will defo go back and try something else next time!

They have wifi but you have to ask for the password
Also, their recommendations are marked with a star on the menu!
Plenty of parking right outside the door!"}
{"text":"Fiancé and I wanted to try something different and we found it. 

We were not disappointed at all. All the food was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. We would recommend this place to anyone.

The wedges, salads and steaks are a must have.

If your looked to try something different get the alligator. Lightly fried, served with fried banana peppers and a citrus aioli. It was to spicy for me but my fiance liked it. Only thing he didn't like was it was really chewy. Oh well new experiences were made.

We will definitely be ordering from here again.

I rated all photos with a brief description. 

Enjoy and eat well!"}
{"text":"First night in Canada, within walking distance from our hotel.  There is outside seating with  no smoking, which is a plus.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  However, I was not overly impressed with my food or one of their signature cocktails.  I was told the best items were the steak, burgers and fish and chips.  I decided on something quick, the cheeseburger and fries.  I was told it was made in house, but it was just okay.  I have had much better and was dissapointed.  If I come back, I will consider the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Came by here with a bunch of friends for after dinner drinks/dessert(so I was told) when we weren't quite ready to call it a night. Considering the place is only a few months old, the place is very spacious with lots of tables and ample floor space. No doubt to accomidate those busy nights, especially when there is an high priority sporting event on! Everything is clean and spotless and appears always ready for customers. Taking in that it was later Sunday evening the place was dead, so we had our pick of tables. Everyone ordered a drink, mine was a \"Special Coffee\", in which I had to explain to them on how to put it together, considering the menu on had maybe one or two other on it there wasn't much of a selection to order from. Plus I ordered \"Bread Pudding\", which was AWESOME, but my wife neglected to tell me that she gets half. Which the waitress already knew cause she brought it to the table with two spoons, which was sweet of her, according to my wife. As for beers in which she forgot to bring for a couple of my friends, all in all service was good. What really made the evening was the company we were with, I would recommend this place for a night out with friends, a sporting event to watch or just a change in atmosphere for something to do, when you're bored of your normal/typical hangout place in which you always wind up in."}
{"text":"awesome, awesome, awesome! 

I think this place used to be the old turtle 'jacks', (where I spent many bar nights in my early 20's) hence the name rib eye 'jacks'. the interior make over was impressive with massive 50\" flat screen TV's everywhere including the women's bathroom.

I bought a wag jag deal for $25 for $50 worth of food and I will be buying more wagjag deals for this place - valid until March 31, 2015

- Excellent service
- 14 ounce t-bone steak to die for!!! with side of buttery veggies and twice baked potato
- fish tacos were healthy and good - a bit too much lettuce for my liking and I think  homemade guacamole would improve them with more pico de gallo
- the beef barley soup was homemade and delicious, def order it!!!
- tried two ipa beers from muskoka (twice as mad tom and detour) loved them both fruity full bodied brews
- penne kids pasta with homemade sauce was a hit for my son and he enjoyed a sundae included in the kids meal

Our bill came to about $90 for the three of us. 

Overall, I will be back plenty of times to try everything on the menu and I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that one of my fave foods around is steak, and there is no steak I like better than a well marbled, perfectly aged Rib Eye. If cooked as they should be, this tender, delicious, juicy piece of red meat will be almost fork tender and each buttery, salty, meaty bite should melt on your tongue whether you take it rare or well done.

Hungry yet? Because I think I just had a wet dream... from my mouth, while reliving my experience at Streetsvilles brand new Rib Eye Jack's Ale House.

Prior to my experience last night at this modern craft beer and whiskey equipped sports bar 'meats' casual fine dining establishment, the best Rib Eye steak I'd ever had was a 20oz from a place called Texas Roadhouse in Michigan. It sear-iously brought tears to my eyes and I'm pretty sure I forgot to chew at times. I just had to become one with this piece of meat ASAP. It's been 5 years since that steak and I miss it everyday.... until last night. Good lord in heaven, from the moment the first bite hit my lips I sat back in stunned shock as I relived many happy nights from long ago. 

The sensation of eating the Cowbow Ribeye covered in mushroom caps and onions can only be equated to that of losing my virginity all over again. The excitement, the pleasure, the uncertainty of what exactly to do with my mouth or hands (long story), if you could achieve nirvana on food-gasm alone, I achieved it 2.5 times last night alone.

Now let's calm down for a minute and talk about some interesting fun facts because I'm about to asphyxiate on my own drool here...

R.E.J's has got a penchant for two of my fave sorts of alcohol (Bourbon/Whiskey) and Craft beer. With over 40 kinds of Whiskey/Bourbon/Scotch/Rye etc, and damn near 100 varieties of bottled craft beer (and another 20 or so draught options) this is THE place to indulge in all of lifes pleasures both bovine and liquid.

**NB: one can also order Growlers of certain craft ales AND in addition to the daily drink specials, every Thursday @ 5pm they ring a bell and crack a craft cask and there are only 40 pints available, so get your glass ready as it's first come first served**

I should also add that they spare no ingredient on their amazing appetizers as I indulged in a cheese and beer soup and some of the dog collar sized onion rings to kick things off and I nearly lost it right then and there.

Other fun facts about REJ's is that its in the former location of Walkers Fish Market (RIP), so if you're looking for a fancy fish dinner, you're going to have look elsewhere form now on.

.... BACK TO THE RIB EYE
The meat was... to say the least, orgasmic (don't judge me) but the sides were on a whole other level. A baked potato/mashed potato cheesey-bacony concoction which came with a side of what I assume was ranch dressing AND buttery asparagus which I slurped at like spaghetti strands.

There isn't much more to say about this place, except that if you're mouth didn't water at least once during this review then we have nothing to say to one another, but if you're like me a red blooded, meat lovin' sorta person and this review got you a little hot under the collar than you need to pay this place a visit. ASAP

Eatcrest OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Headed to this spot for my husbands birthday since he likes craft beers and steak. Decor is kind of cool. Atmosphere was good. There was 5 of us in our group including my teenage daughter and my parents. We registered my husbands birthday online and received his meal for free. 

We started with a shared appetizer platter. Consisted of garlic toast, wings, spinach & artichoke dip with wonton chips, Texas onion rings. $30. 

The birthday boy had a starter Caesar salad 

Mains included roast beef dip with fries, burger with peameal bacon and a side of fries, fillet minion with red skinned mashed potatoes and veggies, rib steak with mushrooms and fries  and beer batter cod with chips. 

My parents choose the sandwiches with fries. Weren't impressed. 

My fillet was cooked to perfect medium. Potatoes were good. I'm a veggie eater but didn't enjoy the selection on my plate. 

My husband had the rib steak. He finished it without complaint. 

My daughter had the fish. She didn't finish it all. Too large of a portion for her. No complaints either. 

Along with the meal we had 4 beer and a daiquiri. 

We brought a cake along and the staff sang to my husband. 

The best part was when our server mistook me for my husband mother!! 

The bill came to $175 after the $40 credits for the birthday boys meal. 

All in all was an ok meal. Not near worth $225 which it would have cost us if not for the birthday credit. 

We went. We ate. We will stick to our local fav pubs in the future."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Mississauga. Over 200 different types of bottled beers and over 15 on draft. The burger I had was excellent and the wedged fries are great. The place is huge and walls are covered with pictures of stars. Lots of tv's for sports fans."}
{"text":"Great steak + alehouse in this area of Mississauga. Customer service is top notch and the location is great for large groups. Good sandwiches, schnitzel and pub food. Highly recommended for large business meeting or to take clients."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some high quality red meat- I would recommend this place.

Location is a little tricky to find- however the ambiance and decor is great. Very well lit. Very modern decor.

I got the peppercorn new yorker and it was delicious. Medium Rare is the way to go. I was craving for a good steak and was going to go to a higher end one like Hy's/ Barberians/ Jacob. 

However I was convinced that for a much fairer price you can find steaks of that quality - but you would have to make the trip out a bit west to do so. I could not complain as the food quality satisfied my craving. The fact that they had so many options for beers also made it an even better experience

Great Service- Great Food- Great time"}
{"text":"These guys have an interesting menu with a bit of everything, and a decent collection of beers. .

I was here for lunch with a co-worker and we both had the Cajun Chicken Sandwich with fries.  It was very good! Although I did not understand why there was a pickle wedge in the sandwich, I would expect it to be sliced so it's easier to eat. Also, shredded lettuce just gets messy. Otherwise, the sandwich was good.  And the fries were... fries. Nothing special. 

The service was very quick (it was pretty empty). I'll come back when the patio is open... seems like the perfect place for a summer beer."}
{"text":"the decor and atmosphere is so nice. perfect place to grab an app, beer, and watch a game. they even have a giant tv in the washroom so you don't miss anything if you have to leave the table!
their food was decent. very unique combos of flavour. they overcooked the steak but it was still good. their fries were okay. i didn't have a problem with my wedges but some of the fries were salted way too much to the point where we didn't bother to touch them. still, i'd come back to try some of their other dishes - maybe get a side salad instead. but still, a very nice place to hang out with friends and catch a game."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Awesome spot for a sports And great beer. Will come back"}
{"text":"I've  visited this place a couple of times now and it's a place I would visit again.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance with tons of pictures of celebrities from back in the day, the booths are comfy and the place overall is nicely decorated.  They have live entertainment at nights on the weekend and they have a great selection on tap. They also have daily drink specials.  The food here is average, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's dry and overcooked.  Majority of the times though the food was cooked properly.  The servers are pretty friendly, so I would give this place four stars, considering all of the above."}
{"text":"I convinced my two best friends to move our catch up session here instead of Cagneys because of their large whiskey collection and they had a Saturday  night whiskey special. Oh how those Old Fashioned gods must be cursing me right now. 

I was initially impressed by their range of craft beer and whiskey choices, correction, I'm still impressed by their selection just not so much the service and taste of the drinks.

The service started off great for 9pm on a Saturday. My friend and I ordered an Old Fashioned and Manhattan to start. Both weren't well made, i guess this should have been a flag. As soon as we told them we won't be ordering food, the service dropped dramatically and they stopped coming around as much. 

My OF had a really odd taste to it and i couldn't figure it out for the first half of the drink and figured it was just poorly made. My stomach was feeling a bit upset, then finally I realized I was tasting salt... so i lifted my glass up and sure enough from the bottom you can clearly see a ton of salt in the drink that hasn't dissolved...  because it's salt and not sugar. 

It took me a while to get a server's attention and when I did I first asked her how they make the drink and when she said sugar, I told her about my drink. She first tried to argue with me that it was sugar and then said she didn't make it. That was tactless. Then she asked if I'd like another and I told her because I was driving I don't want another one. She said Ah Ok and then walked off. 

My friends and I were puzzled over this because nothing was resolved and she left the salty drink on the table. So, after another 10 minutes I was able to flag down another server who I handed the drink to and said I'd like to give this back because it was incorrectly made with salt and I don't want another. Again this server walks off drink in hand with no response. 

30 minutes later my friends ask for the bills and server #1 nonchalantly comes over with a bill for each of us, not even a discount for mine. So I flatly told her I don't think I should be paying for a drink that was made wrong and I couldn't even finish. She says she has to ask her manager and proceeds to process my friends' bills. After this she goes to the bar and I assume talks to her manager but then nothing... she didn't come back or gesture to me at the table the response her manager gave her. She just went about her business, I finally went up to her at the bar because she was no longer flaggable. 

I asked her if the bill was settled and she said yes they discounted it and walked away... WOW 

Up until this point, no one has apologized for the mix up or come by the table to address the issue. Huge lack of interest in customers that aren't dining or ordering tons of drinks or I guess any customers at all made this a huge disappointment and very different from the last time when we ordered food and drinks. 

Smh"}
{"text":"I am a huge Ontario craft beer fan! These guys know there beer!!!!! Intense selection of craft beers accompanied by great food. I really enjoy there steaks! Every Thursday they tap a kask from different breweries at 5pm! Tons of beers you can't purchase at lcbo"}
{"text":"I've had really good meals here. The one off time the rib eye came over done but was still very good and the manager comped the meal.  She was quite adamant that if it wasn't perfect then it's free.  Service has always been good for us.  Will frequent this place."}

The decor is perfect, perfect chairs, booths, and decorations. Bathrooms are fancy too.

Food was delicious, lots of beers to choose from.

Lots of TV's to watch sports. Awesome place indeed!"}
{"text":"Its shrimp festivale, had their dynamite and coconuts shrimp both shrimp are relatively huge in size.  Their wonton nacho is good, could have more meat in my opinion.  The onion rings are particular good"}
{"text":"I ordered the rib steak Chicago medium rare.  It came out medium, not medium rare and not Chicago. It had no flavour and was a poorly cooked steak overall. The side I ordered was wrong.  The \"burnt onions\" were also raw.  I sent the steak back and refused a replacement because the first attempt was so poor.  The waitress was nice enough and did her best to look after us but the chef was way off his game. I would not recommend this place for steak."}
{"text":"Ordered the ribeye and asparagus open face sandwich with fries. Food was fresh, hot, and delicious. Attentive service and fair pricing. I enjoyed it very much and will be back."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise..  3.5 / 5

didn't expect much to be honest.  The pictures on the site had both me and the Mrs. saying that the portions looked awfully small, and we were worried about it's \"chain\" status and being multiple locations, but overall had a pretty good meal surprisingly

we tried..

calamari - $10.99 -  this was the definite clunker of the night, and a silly portion to boot.  again most likely a frozen product, the batter was just too \"uniform\" and every piece looked identical.  Instead of rings they cut them into \"fries\" which was a little bit strange, and overall it was tough and a bit chewy.  Didn't taste bad or anything but definitely a poor value for $11

caesar salad - $9.99 - pretty solid, topped with cheese and actually contained some bacon which seems to be becoming less common these days.  Pricey though at $9.99, but definitely big enough for 2 to split, or 3 small plates

ribs, served with apple-cider coleslaw and potato wedges. - $25.99 - Waitress incorrectly told us the wedges weren't a frozen product, they definitely were.  Not that I think she was trying to lie I just don't think she knew any better.  Ribs were a nice full rack, not smoked but simmered fall off the bone style.  Decent enough, as good as you'd get at The Keg or Baton Rouge type place.  Coleslaw definitely a homemade product which is nice - lots of little mustard seeds throughout, only problem is it was kind of unbalanced and underdressed.  it has potential but they gotta work on the seasoning, it eats a bit bland

\"Kentucky Bastard\" , a glazed rib eye steak served with a cheddar/bacon stuffed potato and asparagus, and 2 jumbo onion rings - $32.99 - Overall very solid -- onion rings are panko crusted and whether a frozen product or not, they were perfectly cooked and served with a nice dipping sauce.  the steak, although a little small and too thin for my liking, had a nice spicy rub on it and glazed with BBQ sauce.  Many purists say sauce on a steak is sacrilege, but it's actually an old family habit in my household so I have no problems with it.  Flavor overall is hot and sweet.  Stuffed potato was delicious but extremely hot, burned the hell out of my mouth on the first bite.  I have a feeling they may nuke the base before putting it under the salamander, but whatever.  Asparagus is a nice garnish

Tuesday was \"Steamwhistle\" night, which was nice, you can get a jumbo \"schooner\" for $7.99 which is an okay deal.  Not great but I am a fan of the beer so I was happy to buy one

Service was okay, waitress didn't know much about the order, a lot of questions I had she kind of had a blank expression on her face as she thought of answers, but she was nice enough

I'm really excited to see if they continue with their \"craft beer\" Thursdays where they apparently crack open a limited edition cask and only serves 40 pints.  I have not attended but definitely plan to.

Overall this is a 3.5 that I'll elevate to at least a 4 after attending one of their cask nights

Points taken away for the calamari (chewy, small portion), and for frozen wedges as a side dish with the ribs (this was a big shock and a big mistake for a place like this and warrants the 1 star deduction on its own).  Two fixable mistakes so hopefully they take this into consideration.  Will update review soon"}
{"text":"The worst service ever !  Rude manager ! no nice friendly greeting at the door, felt like I was crashing a private party.  Never got to getting our order taken, spent over 30 minutes waiting , and walked out ! I do not usually give bad ratings or even take the time to do so, but this place deserves it , so I made it a point to do so !  Find a new manager , hire more staff, give the servers smaller sections , it might succeed !"}
{"text":"This review is a tad biased because I haven't really tried the food here, with the exception of Calamari, but I do think the beverages are fantastic. 

Unusually located near Erin Mills and Battleford, on Mississauga Road, this place is a great find. Rib Eye Jack's offers spacious seating, televisions running sports, reasonably priced food and drinks - however, it seldom gets crowded. I was there on 2 game nights and it wasn't full at all. 

What beer lovers will love about this place, it offers a variety on taps. And for non-beer people, there's surprisingly plenty. My drink of choice is usually the Black and Red Margarita (I believe that's what it's called). 

Margarita Rating: 6/5
This special margarita tastes like no other, comes in a massive glass, well-rimmed with salt, for a wee price of $5.99. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"it's good place with good atmosphere, though being on the pricier side. The selection of craft beer is good but it's 90% Canadian brewers. I was pleasantly impressed by the food - the wings were very meaty and well portioned. It's a great place for company parties as well!"}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer, heavy on Ontario/Quebec micro breweries, with a regular rotation of options on tap. Whisky selection is decent, albeit with Spartan pours for the price. Stick with the suds.

Plenty of TVs laid out in the bar room for you to watch your professional sport(s) of choice.

Would highly recommend the wonton nachos, a well-executed Asian-fusion take on an old bar classic."}
{"text":"I really have nothing to complain about. In fact, I'll have to return to try the other menu items that looked great. I had the calamari which wasn't awe-inspiring but was definitely above average and the mussels, which come with 2 types of mussels and bread for dipping. The marinara sauce had a slight bite, which was great. 
I also had the x-rated lemonade which I would highly recommend.
I went with my mom, who had a caesar, and said it was pretty spicy too, and then she had the sweet potato fries and the shrimp, which she said was a bit too spicy for her liking. The dipping sauces that came with the calamari and sweet potato fries were both great.

They have TVs if you want to watch sport, but also a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and wings combo. The ribs are classified as a 1/3 of a rack. I'm not sure about that. My 1/3 of a rack was the size of a credit card. The ribs were ok.The 4 wings were more filling than the ribs. The wings were good. Overall, both were good. However, not exactly worth $21. Anyway I commented on how small the portion seemed and my meal was comped. Wow! I totally said it was unnecessary but ok, great! The service was 5 stars. I'll give this place a try another time."}
{"text":"Was there last night. Great beer selection good steaks and very refined decor. Staff was great and recommended this as a place to watch a game and have good beer and food. Love the black and white movie pixs framed all over the restaurant"}
{"text":"The complete dining experience should begin right at the front door. When my friend and I entered through the main entrance we were left just kind of standing there. No one smiled, no one greeted us. I almost felt like I just arrived at a party that I was not invited too.

The hostess finally told us it could be a 20 to 30 minute wait and abruptly took down our names. We actually had to point out to the hostess a few minutes later  that we noticed a table had become available.

Ironically the place was packed, and its really sad to see a place like this treating customers like cattle when its busy. A good restaurant will make everyone feel welcome no matter how busy it gets.

Having said this, there are better steak restaurants in this area with way better service, their menu is just like everyone Else's and the pricing was nothing special either.

Based on their current service levels, I can honestly see this placing closing down within a year.

If you are thinking about trying this place out, don't bother, its not worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come here for date night on a Saturday. We didn't have to wait for a table (actually the place was pretty quiet for a Saturday night) - I thought that maybe it's because the restaurant is tucked away. I ordered the baseball cut top sirloin and my husband ordered the Denver cut NY striploin. The sides of mashed potatoes and corn on a cob came with both meals as there are no other choices for sides. I added 2 large crunchy onion rings on top of my steak for an extra $4.00. The food presentation was bare and the steaks were underwhelming (the sear on the striploin was good, crunchy and not too much fat. I would rank this place just a tad higher than Jack Astor's and not even close to the Keg (and the Keg is not even that great). If you're a drinker, this place does have a large selection of beer, whiskey and bourbon. The décor is trendy with a wine wall and large TVs. I wouldn't come back here for steaks though..."}
{"text":"All you need to know that Rib Eye's Jack is they have BEERs! Local Craft Beers that you can order samples and try out a few interesting ones.

This is the second location where the original one located in Burlington.

And of course aside from ALE, there is MEAT.

Cowboy Rib Steak ($34.99)

Ketucky Bastard  ($32.99)

Colossal Onion Rings ($9.69)

So tender as their Craft Steaks are Canadian AAA  aged 28 days for tenderness Whiskey dipped in Wild Turkey Bourbon, and flame grilled!

The vibe here is casual and cozy.  Service is attentive.

Definitely worth coming here for a drink. And they have Cask Night Every Thursdays and drink specials every night."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and this place had good reviews. I ordered their signature rib eye and it was horrible. It was cold , very thin cut (didn't even melt the butter served with it) and very little flavor.  I do not recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I was here back in August and am just now getting around to writing the review. I always love it here - the food is consistently great and the service is always good. In the rare event something isn't quite right, they make it right.

I love the atmosphere and when they have someone in singing. 

It's a great place to hang out - the game is always on.

Wish I knew the server's name. She was so great. Her timing in checking on us was perfect and she was so much fun. We asked her to take a break and join us.

Love this place. Having trouble naming specifics because I honestly just love it all. I don't even mind that it is slightly pricey, because the quality is always there.

May be a bit too loud for date night, especially if it's early on - harder to talk. But otherwise it's great for pretty much any occasion. I've been with family and friends and with kids.

Always good. Go check it out. But don't make it too busy - I don't want to wait too long for a table."}
