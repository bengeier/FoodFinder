{"text":"So glad to see they opened a Presto in Henderson.  Enjoy their healthy eating options. Just enjoyed apple strawberry salad scoop and ahi tuna salad scoop.  Lite and just enough to tie me over till i finish my errands for the day."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The quality of food is great, the menu is interesting for a small cafe, and the owner and staff greet you with a smile.  The price is a couple of bucks more than an average cafe. ($8 to $10 for a sandwich),  but the quality is far better than the average cafe.

I love the steak chimichurri, the salmon, and the meatball pide.

I recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about going down hill. I used to really like this place. Owner must not be involved anymore. Employees are rude and don't seem to care. Waited 45 mins for lunch. There was only us and one other person there. They almost got a refund and left. We were right behind them. This place has ruined it's self and I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"This is my second time here this week! Everyone is super nice and the good is delicious. I have had a meatball pide and the no pasta lasagna. Both excellent. The food is cooked to order and whe you receive it, it is nice and hot. The portion sizes are very generous and good for sharing multiple dishes."}
{"text":"It is a solid four in its category of fast, fresh, and healthy fair (not unlike the evolved Panera). A great choice after a workout or for those who find themselves out for lunch often. Plenty of options. Seared ahi tuna salad was good, dressing ok, a bit watery, but you put it on yourself so not a big deal. Complimentary ingredients in the cauliflower and kale curry salad, although, the vinaigrette is heavy handed (maybe its the pickling of the onions or trying to balance between the curry component and the dressing). I'd like to come in again and try an entree."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow! Service sucks! People couldn't care about how slow! It's lunch time I don't want to wait 30 minuets after I paid $60 for my family to go to lunch! They need to get their stuff together! You can't be slow and expensive!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic,  the wait was unacceptable.  We waited 40 minutes for our lunch order. We complained, no one cared. The owner was there and didn't even bother to look up. When we approached the  very young cashier she said \"what's up?\" What's up is that your food is amazing, your kitchen is horrible.  I signed up for a Yelp account to post this review."}
{"text":"I've been staying at the hotel across the street. I discovered this place and have been going there every day since. It's all good but the salmon was unreal. If I lived in Vegas this would be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but it's happened twice where I have ordered their breakfast burrito with no bacon, and it comes full of bacon. I'm a vegetarian, so getting a mouthful of bacon is really off-putting. Everything else is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, just happened to be in the area. Ordered the corned beef sandwich. Home made corned beef, makes all the difference. Will be going back to try other items."}
{"text":"It just gets better and better! How do they prepare that wild salmon? It is soooo good!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for years on the way to Teriyaki Madness and I've kept meaning to try it. I'm only bummed now that I waited so long!

Their sandwiches are amazing. Every component on their sandwiches is top notch from the bread to meat to the cheese to the sauces. Easily some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread, the bread is amazing!

The turkey sandwich is roast turkey like you'd make yourself, not deli turkey. The ruben is also amazing. The sandwiches are huge. It's a hair pricey, but the quality of food is definitely there and I wasn't disappointed by the portion sizes."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely excellent. Even though there were only two of us, we ordered a lot of food because we couldn't decide. The owner was amazing and described not only the ingredients, but the health benefits of each. 

Scoop of ahi: Came as a salad. The fish was fresh seasoned amazingly, and had a  housemade dressing. Despite the creamy dressing, the ahi wasn't overpowered. Two scoops of this would make an excellent lunch. 

\"Scoop\" of steak: Don't let the name fool you. This is actually a small tenderloin of hanger steak cooked perfectly to Man's exact medium rare liking. I tasted a piece of the medium-ish edge. It was wonderfully seasoned. 

Meatball sliders: I love a good meatball and these did not disappoint. They came on a toasted brioche bun. My only criticism of the entire meal is that the sliders needed sauce. The cook happily obliged in giving us a to-go cup of sauce when we packed up out leftovers. 

Italian pide: I'm a Chicago girl and a pizza snob, so I won't compare the pide to pizza, but definitely better than any calzone I've had. The crust was soft and filling but not heavy. I was surprised the cheese and sauce was also in the rolled up edges. This is definitely enough for two people to share. Also love that the owner described the difference between his crust and typical crusts. I'm a convert and without a doubt will be back to try each type. 

Marguerite chicken: I was so surprised this place has \"real\" food entrees on the menu. When brought to the table, I would have though with flavor and presentation that I was in any high end free standing restaurant. The veggies weren't just an afterthought and I love the quinoa instead of rice. Bravo!! 

Overall, one of my new favorite places. The friendly staff and casual atmosphere only add to the hominess of the entire experience. I would have give 5 stars if only I could have had an adult beverage to accompany my amazing meal. See you next visit!"}
{"text":"I tried Presto for the first time last night and got the Greek Pide. It was sooooo delicious. My mom tried it and asked me to get her some today. I went back and ordered the Ham and Cheese sandwich that was also so good! Definitely recommend it. The staff is very friendly and outgoing too."}
{"text":"Delish! Finally found a place with great salads (no I'm not a vegetarian just REALLY looking for some quality greens). You would think I was asking for world peace or something. Craving officially satisfied.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else.  Service is great also!"}
{"text":"I get the salmon meal here and the pide and they are always good. This place hasn't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic combination of healthy, freshness and positively delicious food. I am reading some reviews here about how the service was bad or nit-picking ridiculous problems, however, I went and met the owner and he was hands on and the food came out quick and hot. I'm going back this week! Out of bounds good."}
{"text":"Food and service were fantastic. Reza greeted us at the counter and offered suggestions and general insight to their product/mission. 
We ordered the Greek pide and a spinach and farro salad. The salad was delicious. The veggies (spinach, radishes, asparagus, scallions) were all fresh and had great texture and crunch. 
The pide was a show stopper. The pesto 'sauce' contains kale, Spanish, and cashew that add additional nutrients and creaminess. The crust has no white flour and apparently is higher in protein....healthy! We were told this pide would be best split and would be around 600 calories per serving. 
 Very delighted with this experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First off, I can say that the food was not bad at all. We ordered Green Eggs and Ham flat bread and the BBQ Chicken pizza. Both were super good. The bad things were:

-Cooks did not seem aware of what they were supposed to be making considering the fact that they had to ask each other multiple times whether the pizza was BBQ or Greek and every time, I answered instead of their manager or front counter person whom sat in the back on his laptop the entire time we were there. 

-IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY, MAKE SURE YOU ASK WHAT IS IN THE SAUCES!!!! I have a severe allergy to only cashews and pistachios. I do know from eating somewhat healthy that some vegan cheeses are made/ based from cashews. Never in my right mind though did i think to ask that the pesto was made from cashews (as it is normally made with pine nuts) and they do not disclose any of this on the menu or the to-go menu. Needless to say after a phone call to the restaurant and a hospital visit there were cashews in the pizza. I did not even get to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Great healthy fresh food. Made to order but the downside is the wait. I've tried the ahi tuna seasonal salad and it's amazing! The smoothies are fresh and aren't overly sweet. Decent portions considering the quality of the dishes. The meatball sandwich is really good and is great for comfort food:) 
Perfect place for a post gym workout meal."}
{"text":"I have been a long time Presto fan and with most places its hard to transfer the same quality that you fall in love with from 1 store to another. Well they did it. I love the meatball sliders and recently became a huge fan of the breakfast burrito. Little known secret your allowed to add the steak which takes it to another level. Reza the owner really knows how to make you feel good when you come in and i cant be happier for the new location. Best Of luck."}
{"text":"We were on our way back to Vegas from one day trip and decided to stop for lunch. Found this place because it was close to freeway. Looks like just a restaurant in a suburban shopping plaza. We were pleasantly surprised when we got our food. For ~$40 for two ppl we got true gourmet meal! I'm not joking! The owner should open restaurant on or near the Vegas strip - he will be millioner."}
{"text":"Healthy Food that Keeps this Realtor on the Go

As a busy Realtor, my office is in my car.  I try to eat well but my choices are pretty limited when I am out showing houses. Fast food tends to make me crash in the late afternoon so I try to avoid that. When I heard that Presto Café was going to open up down in Henderson, I was very anticipative.  I was not disappointed.  I walked in just after lunch time to see the place still pretty full.  The decor was nice and it felt very clean inside.  I also noticed that they had free Wi-Fi which is fantastic for those of us on the go.
I am a devout carnivore but I decided that I would put Presto Café to the test, so I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich with the Tropical Wake Up Smoothie.  I took a seat and waited for my order.  It was obvious that people REALLY enjoy eating there.  I noticed the owner, Reza Arshandi, talking with everyone and making them feel at home.  It was great to see everyone enjoying their meal.  You can tell that Reza takes great pride in the food he serves his customers.
When my food arrived, I was very pleased by the presentation.  The sandwich came with a wonderful strawberry and apple salad on the side.  When I took my first sip of my smoothie it was obvious that it was not made from one of those sugary mixes.  I could taste the fruit and it was not heavy at all.  I was also very happy with the sandwich.  Even though the sandwich had eggplant, tomatoes and oil, the bread never got soggy.  It was a great blend of flavors and was very satisfying.  After I was finished I felt full but still energetic which was great because I had a busy afternoon ahead.
It's great to find the perfect combination of high quality food, generous servings and good prices.  I was in and out in less time than a normal restaurant but this is not fast food.  It is a great place to go if you want to sit down and relax and still be done in 30 min or so.  I also noticed that I still felt very fresh and full around 4pm.    I look forward to bringing my clients here soon."}
{"text":"Loving this place. Definitely a new family favorite. We've had the Rueben, the corned beef breakfast sandwich, a wide variety of salads on the by the scoop menu with or without protein added, the protein ball cookies, the Greek Salad, the Pides, and once had the sea bass special. I leave full, but not uncomfortably so. I feel great after eating here, never weighed down or tired. I recommend Presto Café. On the by the scoop salad menus, I personally enjoy the faro salad and the seared tuna salad."}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressed with this place. I was really sick and my husband grabbed food from here for me. He got us 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 smoothies and when he told me it cost him almost $40 I was floored. The food was good but definitely not worth that price. I haven't been back since and that was over a year ago! If you are going to charge high prices you should make sure your food matches the price."}
{"text":"Having read reviews on Yelp on Presto over the weekend I had made a mental note to give it a try.  As it turned out finding myself hungry I was about to pull into Highroller for a Fig it Out Burger but remembered I was also in the vicinity of Presto as well.  A quick U turn I couldn't be more delighted to find an actual full shady spot at 4 pm.  I'm a big fan of being greeted upon entering with a hello  at least in smaller establishments such as this so I was smiling from the git go!  There were fewer than ten customers and no line when we arrived.  Had I not read the reviews on Yelp I wouldn't have known about the salad by the scoop, or what a Pide was or how it was pronounced.  This place really has a WONDERFUL business concept.  The niche it fills has a tremendous potential for SUCCESS especially with its location.  I doubt that they could have found a more ideal location UNLESS...it had a drive through window for quick juice, or Smoothie Pick ups or such.  Comfortable seating was comfortable.  My daughter chose a smoothie and was very pleased with it.  Giving me a taste I found the flavor balance of ingredients to be very well thought out.  Ginger can easily be over done....but this was very well done!  
My order of Greek Pide arrived and looked yummy and the ingredients Grape Tomatoes Basil Pesto and red peppers  were bright and made my mouth water.  
The crust looked golden for the most part on top... although there was one end with a burnt area but with a fresh baked item I expect a certain amount of variety and as in the case of many pieces of art... there is room for such flaws...and if it had ended there... I wouldn't have considered there to be any flaw in this Pide. It wasn't until flavor profiles seemed off that I turned the piece I was eating over to discover it was burnt. As it was directly beneath the area that appeared the most burnt I didn't think much of it and as the rest didn't look too over cooked from the top I didn't expect for a moment that the rest would be inedible as well.  I scraped the ingredients off eating them and enjoying them... I nibbled on the surface crust that was fine.   I enjoyed my meal.  I made it work. Why?  Well Having more errands to run in what is turning out to be a very busy week I didn't have the time to wait for another to be prepared.  And they are prepared to order which is one of the delights of Presto.  My daughter asked if I was going to let the managment know and I assured her that I would.   As I bussed our table I took the 'plate' to the counter and was asked by a tall smiling gentleman how it was.   I replied \"Burnt\".  He looked me in the eye and said \"awesome'.   I was a bit taken aback.   I asked him why burnt was Awesome and I realized he must have not heard me correctly.  The plate was shown to others in the kitchen and I was offered a refund.  There was no need for a refund.  I simply wanted them to be aware of the potential of having to make an adjustment to cook times or oven temps.  As I was exiting another customer asked about my meal.  I stopped and spoke with her and was interrupted by the tall man behind the counter and told not to bother other guests.  The guest and I both informed him that she had inquired and so I was simply responding.  THIS interaction left more of a sour taste in my mouth than the discovery that the entire bottom crust of my meal was burnt.  Somethings in this establishment need to improve.  Some are easy fixes like adjusting oven temps.  If one views photos posted by others there is also a Blanco Pide shown which is burnt enough on top to make me wonder if it was perhaps blacker than mine now in retrospect. Some things are not as easy to fix in a business."}
{"text":"Overall a very positive experience the owner was very friendly and helpful when explaining items on the menu to me. I ended up getting the hanger steak chimichurri (3.5-4/5) I really liked the couscous that the steak was on.

Overall the restaurant is a little pricey but I did get one of the more expensive items. Next time ill try some of their dishes. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Three stars seem fitting. There really isnt much to say. 

It isn't great and it isn't horrible. 

Their prices are a little high, their portions are kind of small. It does take a while to get your food, but I guess that is a good thing because it means what you are getting is freshly made. 

If you are looking for something healthy and don't really know where to go, it is worth the try."}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem! So glad we found this place. Everything is made to order & it's so delicious & so healthy. The breakfast burrito was amazing. I wish they had this in San Diego."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had  the Ruben and the Greek Pide with a scoop of Israeli couscous salad and the ahi tuna salad (seasonal). Everything was delicious! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Very bummed they closed this location, we love their food. Delicious and healthy. So sorry to see them leave."}
{"text":"Expensive, not that great tasting, and took them 35 minutes to make two sandwiches. Definitely seemed understaffed since they were getting to-go orders out before ours. Not the best customer service or atmosphere either, just seemed really bland and boring in there.

Also, the guy behind us was waiting for his food just as long as us and they forgot his soup, it took them about 15 more minutes to get him his soup. I could tell he was livid.

Hopefully they improve but sorry to say we will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy, affordable, delicious! I'm addicted. The people are friendly and it's all so fresh. Parking is easy. They do breakfast, lunch & dinner. It is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now since it opened since it's in the same complex as I work out in. There hasn't been anything I haven't liked so far!  The smoothies have been delicious, my favorite being the Morning fix smoothie and the Pide is fantastic. My last trip in I tried their turkey sandwich and it was delicious! They recommend to add the egg and glad I did!  The bacon was crispy, bread was delicious and very fresh and light. 

They've been fairly slow each time I've been in, but they are also new so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as I can only imagine opening a new location. 

I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First timer. Chilean Sea Bass stir fry special was an amazing surprise. It's like a five-star restaurant's chef opened up a strip-mall cafe. These guys could have their own cooking show - or at least win all the contests. Instead, they just make great food for a cool clientele (present company excepted, wait... I'm walking out now)."}
{"text":"Fabulous food in a very unassuming location.  We had the Greek pide and the hanger steak with couscous. Both were outstanding.  The menu is small,  but focused on quality, healthy food.  In fact, perhaps the only thing I would change is the somewhat overbearing emphasis on the healthful menu. Can't wait to go back and sample the breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Been reading some of the reviews on this place, mostly negative about the staff and the wait time for food. But, I tend to want to check things out for myself before judging...Presto Cafe, right off the 215 east and Stephanie...in the same lot where the Gold's Gym used to be (what happened there?) and next to Gimme Some Sugar (where I'll be gettin one them giant macarons  they have after this meal!).

So, the staff was very accommodating...my wife likes to ask a lot of questions. I got the Blanco Pide (pronounced Pee-day, sounds like bidet ) and a scoop of the Israeli cous cous. My wife settled on the turkey sandwich with a side of the \"special\" salad, which had seared Ahi in it.

Our salads came out first, the cous cous salad was hmmm good. But, my wife's seared ahi salad was bomb (should've got that...). Her turkey sandwich came out a couple minutes later and my pizza, I mean Pidet emerged a couple minutes after that. The Blanco Pidet was delicious, had a creamy white sauce, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses topped with nuts and  bacon (added the bacon when I was told they didn't do the shaved pork anymore...). The crust wasn't as crunchy as I would've liked...maybe next time I'll ask them  to burn it a little more. Had a bite of the turkey sandwich, the cranberry bread added an extra depth of flavor. I told my wife she should have added an fried egg on it, to put it over the top (she didn't think so).

Overall, good food (albeit a bit pricey...), attentive and friendly staff...great place to meet for Brunch, and hey, some leftover Pidet for a midnight snack! Will definitely be back (super close to our house too).

And now, on to the giant macarons!"}
{"text":"Update:
Consistency is getting better, staff is more professional and friendly since my first few months of experiences here. Overall, a great improvement in service!"}
{"text":"had an ok kale salad and tandoori flavorless salad
green smoothie they had was bleh
never coming back"}
{"text":"Hopefully this place gets better and better as time passes.. Solid 4 stars for the food but gotta give them a 2 for service at my first visit...

Tried to call in food, for I only have a 30 min break, but phone line only kept ringing.. 
Since it's very close to work I didn't think it would take any longer than 15 mins to get in and get out.. Boy was I wrong! 
35-40 minute wait for my Greek Salad and Hanger Steak!!! Two ladies that may have been there way longer before me didn't get their food until 20 mins of putting my order in..
May I add that the three of us were the only customers there.. 

One thing I noticed was quite a handful of people walked in to ask for a physical menus but PC did not have them.. Yet? .. 
So they had walked out..

Let's talk food :
($6) Greek Salad - (coworker had this item) HUGE portion! Fresh and tasty.. Except the fact that they forgot the vinaigrette ..  
($14) Hanger Steak Chimichurri - comes Truffle Israeli couscous, risotto style. Steak was tender, cooked properly and the couscous was creamy. I did find the chimichurri to have tasted more like pesto ..

Overall satisfied with the food but I was just disappointed of the long wait.. I get the whole soft opening, training, they're new part.. But 35 mins is just way too long..

I'll be giving them another chance in a month or so.."}
{"text":"You know that moment where life just feels so good? That's what eating at Presto is like.

Popped in for lunch with a coworker on the recommendation of several friends who have been to the Rainbow location. 

This spot is clean, the menu has great options for anyone because the food is just like comfort food, and healthy!

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pides. Kind of like a pizza but with a waaay better crust. It was thin, chewy, not dry and not greasy. Just right.

The best part is that the Pides doesn't give you that awful food coma feeling.

Can't wait to come back! 

It's the perfect meal! The owner Reza is super nice and loves when customers walk in. When I met him, he was so enthusiastic about the menu and the food."}
{"text":"I got a smoothie and my husband got the breakfast burrito. We are here right this second enjoying them. Good service. Comfortable seating."}
{"text":"edit: as of latest visit, October 31,sign on front door says Gone Fishing. thanks for support Henderson and to visit Rainbow location. 

Grateful that there are restaurant owners like Reza, who right away communicated with me, reached out, invited me back and thanked me for speaking up.

It's really nice to see how much Presto Cafe truly values their customers. Back to my usual Ham & Cheese Please and side beet salad. My lunch today rocked!"}
{"text":"And Presto! Healthy and delicious food!

I am trying to start the new year off right by changing my diet.  I think I've had my share of 'unhealthy' food for the past few years.  Presto offers healthy comfort food that I won't feel guilty about eating.  Located on the corner of Stephanie and Paseo Verde, it's very easy to find.  I was tempted to walk next door to Gimme Some Sugar (one of my favs) but I resisted.

I met a friend here for lunch.  She is the epitome of healthy! So what do I order? The Vegetarian Lasagna and a scoop of Israeli couscous.  The verdict? Absolutely delicious! The lasagna is pasta free with sweet potato, kale and eggplant.  I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I loved it!   Filling and delicious without the guilt. The garlic sauce was a great compliment.

Presto also offers a variety of side salad scoops.  Trust me when I say 1 scoop is more than enough.  The couscous consisted of mushrooms, parmesan and lemon truffle.  So flavorful and would definitely order this again.

The dining area was kept very clean with pretty comfy chairs as well! Service was great.  Very friendly staff all around!  They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner for your enjoyment!"}
{"text":"My sister brought me to Presto I hate to say it but healthy and good don't usually run together when it comes to my food. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming the food was made fresh I didn't read the menu I just saw the Lasagna. And didn't realize there's sweet potatoes in it I hate sweet potatoes. But to my surprise it was delicious I will defiantly go back loved it!"}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb!  I love the pida.. the low carb pizza..  sooooo good.  Food here is tasty, organic, and very affordable!  It's one of the reason's I bother training at EOS.. just so I can eat here afterwards lol.

I'd give this place six stars if I could.  It's the standard for fresh healthy cafes."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant hidden off of Stephanie.  The food is so flavourful and delicious! You almost always need a to go box.  But not always because it's so good you want to keep eating. Definitely try a \"scoop\" of their sides....delish!! Turkey sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"First impressions was the place was empty and unfriendly. Food was greasy (breakfast bowl), coffee cream was actually whipping cream, sugar packets were dirty with old stains on them. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for restaurants that serve healthy food that is at least palatable...Presto Cafe' goes above & beyond. I've tried several selections and each tastes better than the next! Very satisfying and no dietary guilt! Among my faves are the Pide (flourless pizza) and their signature turkey sandwich (the salads are great, too). Good location, casual & comfortable dining area, nice & efficient staff. Great place to meet up with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is a great healthy place to catch lunch. The prices are reasonable, and the food tastes great. The atmosphere is cozy, and the service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"So, me and the hubs went in and had some lunch. My has been ordered the chimichurri steak and the mushroom Risotto and I ordered the lobster roll. I tried my lobster roll, which was a hand shelled lobster (maybe less than 6 oz.) that was on a soggy piece of garlic bread next to a tasty little spring salad. The lobster roll was not worth the $14. It was soaked in an oily sauce with some flavor of the lobster but nothing more. My husband's plate was full of steak and creamy delight. I ate off his plate and it was heaven. The risotto was cooked just right  with rich and creamy mushroom flavors. The meat was rare and tender. I had the,\"I should of ordered this instead of that overpriced lump of sea cockroach\" face. 
I don't think I would come back for the lobster roll, and the service was mediocre with the cashier looking like he was miserable, although I think he was also the owner."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our drive home heading out of Vegas for breakfast burritos.  Surprised to find organic ingredients and burritos made with love.  Smoothies were yummy and not too sweet.  The salads and rest of the menu looked awesome so we will be back to try on our next trip."}
{"text":"Always been huge fan ever since the first Presto Cafe open near my house. When I heard they open another one on the opposite side of town in Henderson. Hell yay! Can never have enough of good thing in life. Best part is both locations is located off 215 so got north and south side of town check and double check. I was going with my favorite either the turkey or reuben sandwich. I figure new location mark try something never had before. I went with the Meatball Sandwiches. Three Meatball sliders. Anyone would be crazy not too get scoop of one of the Presto salads. My go to is always the israeli couscous salad. I love the combination of the mushrooms, perfect couscous, and some truffle oil tossed in with some herbs. I could order three scoops and be in couscous heaven with nice bowl. The Meatball sliders too be honestly VERY surprised the way it turned out. Comes too my sandwich at Presto have my fav and meatball sandwich meatballs nothing gets me personally excited. I ended up having was three amazing sliders! The brioche mini buns (always wrote that sandwich starts with the bread filling second) awesome. It had the nice crust on the outside, moist on the inside, and any slider combination would be the bomb with those buns. The meatball is very tasty. It nice nice depth of flavor and seasonings. Combine just right about of pomodoro sauce (pet peeves overkill on tomato sauce in meatball is recipe for disaster), the cheese, and right about of bread. Some of the best sliders I have had in sometime. I never been too the more upscale meatball restaurant. You pay price of one meatball that can get three meatball sliders. I can tell you would take some Presto Cafe Meatballs hand down over the pricey name brand. I love small business owners and seeing Presto grow from one too two restaurant. Awesome. 

The food totally felt like it was the same quality getting at the other location. They are some differences besides the obvious location. The display for the salads are little different. I prefer the other location only because you have more choices and  looks more appealing nicely lined up side by side. This location not as much in bigger containers, two different levels, and different vibe. Thankfully the quality is still as good as it gets. The new location hold more people in the restaurant. The interior design much more of open kitchen look and seems brighter with the paint color scheme. They do have wi-fi. I not sure if the other location has since I never used it at Presto. 

The customer service was awesome. We lucked out Suzy H and I after training day no one in the place just us. Forget mention recovery meals Presto Cafe is great! Come too think of it need make list. Recovery meals that kick ass... I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was looking for new and healthy restaurant around the area and yelp led me to this place. When walking in we were immediately greeted by the two gentlemen working. They were kind of hilarious and good company while they were preparing my food. I ordered the ahi sliders and vegetarian lasagna! Oh man they were delicious! The only reason I give 4 stars is because the ambience was just mediocre, but I got take out anyways...Will definitely be going back when I'm in town and glad to see they are serving juice! NOM!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and will definitely become regulars.  I am gluten free and vegetarian so there aren't a lot of places I can go but there were quite a few options that I want to try.  
We had the vegetarian lasagna and it was so good, even my meat eating husband loved it.  We also had the couscous salad and my husband had the seasonal ahi salad and both were amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try more off of their menu."}
{"text":"I took a group of 6 friends on opening day. It was perfect! There was only a couple of people there so we were able to join a few tables together and we ate like the knights at the round table. It was awesome! We all got smoothies starting with the Just Peachy, which my friend Neal absolutely loved. Elias, Rosy, Carlos and Cynthia all got Brain Powers and as for myself and Kyle, we got some Tropical Wake up(my favorite with banana, pineapple, mango, and coconut water). Reza is such a great host! He gave us suggestions for pides (pea-days) and salads. Kyle cant have gluten so he paired him up with some Chicken Tandoori salad and Pickled Beet salad. Reza even gave the table the Seasonal Ahi Tuna salad, that now has us coming back for more every time! We also ordered the No Pasta Lasagna (PHENOMENAL) and the Green Eggs and Ham, which you just have to try to believe it! The whole experience left everyone happy and satisfied. Thanks guys for having a spot where healthy meets tasty. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! this is my favorite place and a must have every time I'm in town.  

Great quality of food!
Extremely flavorful (specially for healthy food)

The best part is that they use science to put together the ingredients so that they work together to bring you the most nutrition!"}
{"text":"After dining here multiple times for both lunch and breakfast, I am unsure how I feel about Presto. I love the healthy options of normally unhealthy food like meatball subs and pizza, AKA \"pide\" (pronounced pee-day). But for some reason I always feel there is something missing. 
On my most recent experience I noticed they had overall went downhill with dead flowers on the tables, and a filthy tea machine. (Clean those AT least every other day) 
My greens in the breakfast wrap were so wilted it made it unappetizing. 
My boyfriend, however loved his steak and eggs, and I am a big fan of the ham & cheese sammy. They put Funyons on it! Total score! 
I did try the Italian style Pide, and that was not bad. I have seen the owner make contact with everyone, and also sit in the back and not say anything to anyone. 
I personally would like to see a bit better service from here. And all around more consistency. I know starting a new business is NOT easy, but don't start something great, and only be so/so every other visit. 
I will indeed return, in hopes of an upgrade."}
{"text":"Love this place and come here often with my family. This past weekend was a totally different experience and it could be because the owner was not there. 
When we arrived only two tables were occupied, and the empty tables were dirty. All 3 guys behind the counter at some point said hello, but no one said I'll be right with you. 
After ordering, I went ahead and asked for a rag so I could wipe down the table, I was then told they would do it.. so after sitting down for a while, they came out and cleared it off. 
Oddly enough, another couple who walked in shortly afterwards had to ask the same thing. 
The food was good as it always is. They usually bring it around the counter to your table, however this time we were asked if we could grab it ourselves. 
I completely understand if the place is packed a lack of customer service, but that was not the case today, when we arrived there were only two tables occupied and they had their food.. 
Again, great food, need to address their service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and I really like it. I ordered the turkey sandwich which comes with cheese,avocado ...etc on walnut cranberry bread. Needless to say I've been back three times since and ordered the same thing. The only thing they they may want to work on is getting the food out faster. I personally don't mind the wait time but a few other people I recommended it to told me they had to wait quite a while for their to-go orders. I say, worth the wait! Yummy! I hope they eventually expand the menu and have more salad options like chinese chicken salad...etc. It makes sense to add more low carb options to the menu since they're located in the same plaza as Gold's gym. 

Anyway.....yum, yum, yum! Go and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have a difficult time finding a gluten free sandwich and when i do the bread is usually sell than terrific.  Presto has amazing gluten free bread and all of the sandwiches I have tried there are outstanding!  The Greek salad is yummy, as well.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  The owners have a passion for helping us feed our bodies the food that will make us thrive.  I will be a loyal customer forever!

{"text":"Really like this place. I go at least once a week. Salmon is delicious. Friendly staff. The smoothies are excellent, so much better than chain \"juice bars\"."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot and so close to my house!!! Everything is so great!!! I think I've had pretty much everything on the menu too!!! The avocado ad pea salad is my favorite. Great selection for any kind of eater with any kind of diet limitations."}
{"text":"Only tried this once, but we had a great meal made to order for us.  Kids loved the pizza and we really enjoyed our pides.  Staff was very friendly and let us try some of the salads.  I wouldn't say the options were exceptionally healthy, but everything seemed very fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I am impressed by the food. I ordered the Ham & Cheese. It has cranberries Funyuns on grilled bacon bread. I also ordered the seared Ahi Salad everything is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"I looove this place! First time I ever tried them was at their Rainbow location and since it's a bit of a drive for me, I hadn't been able to go as much as I'd like to but thankfully they opened a spot on my side of town! It is a bit dangerous for me to come here though since they're right next to Gimme Some Sugar lol. 

My favorite thing is get is their Hippie Meal, which is also the best value in my opinion as well for $12.99. Especially since healthier food is a little on the pricey side sometimes. It comes with any full size sandwich, any side and a drink! So far I haven't tried any sandwich besides their Turkey - Turkey, Applewood Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo on a toasted rustic cranberry walnut bread. Sounds pretty normal, I know, but there's just something about the bread and cheese they use that has me craving it. Next time I swear I'll try their Ruben or Vegetarian sandwich since they both Sounds amazing.

Other items I really enjoy:
Blanco Pide  - Ricotta, Pistachios, garlic blanco sauce. Made fresh to order, I saw them rolling out the dough and also it's enormous. Perfect for two people or leftovers later. Also a great healthier option when I'm craving a white pizza.

Couscous Salad: Israeli couscous, wild mushrooms, parmesan, lemon truffle. I love everything about this salad, this is usually the side I pick when I get their Hippie Meal. Super flavorful mushrooms and truffle and the texture of the couscous is perfect.

& my favorite smoothies are: 
-Green Goodness Smoothie- Apple, Avocado, Banana, Spinach, Kale, Ginger, Agave nectar.
-Just Peachy Smoothie- Peach, Mango, Strawberry, banana, Fresh pressed apple.
These are also a good value in my opinion since they aren't watered down like in some places and because their 24oz is under $8!

Some other tips:
-I've know some people to order just a scoop of any of their salads for $3.50 since it's a pretty good size for a healthy snack. 
-There are options to make your own juice.
-There is a kid's menu available. 

Can't wait to come back and try their Vegetarian Lasagna & Hanger Steak Chimichurri!"}
{"text":"Got the Greek Pide and Hanger Steak. Both dishes were delicious! I gave this place a 5 star because of these two dishes but wished the prices were a little lower. We paid about $30 for both dish and thought the price was a little steep. 

The food came out slowwwww and it took a while, but thankfully the dishes were good and worth the wait.  It's a good place to try, but I don't think I will back because it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"I have frequented the Presto Cafe on Rainbow in Spring Valley many of times and I have to say I like that location better than this one.
 The storefront windows are not tinted/shaded very well so at 1:00pm is was sunny and stuffy in the dining area. I couldn't imagine how hot/bright is it in mid summer. 
There isn't much of a place to dine due to the enormously overstuffed chairs. They are very thick and padded which take up a lot of room. It felt very crowded in the dining area and there were only 2 other customers.
 The place could have used a sweeping/dusting/wiping down of the tables, chairs, and floor. The bathroom wasn't disgusting, but again- it could have used some attention.
 Food was right on with what I expect from Presto Cafe. I like the open kitchen to see your food being prepared. Service was with a smile. 
I had the usual green drink and veggie sandwich. I sampled my friend's vegetarian lasagne and it was great! Thankfully she offered me more bites."}
{"text":"Food is great, the turkey sandwiches and steak and eggs are my favorites. It does take a while for them to make the food, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been to the original on Rainbow and Trop but this was my first time to the new location. The menu was updated and had some new additions. 

I decided to try the breakfast burrito but I added hanger steak! Wow! This was incredible, I couldn't put it down. Also got one of their famous Pides... I am a huge pizza lover but this blew away any pizza and it was healthy! 

I will recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great food. Too bad they are only open till 8pm. 
Like myself, a lot of people in the casino industry work till 8pm so I won't be able to pick up food after my shift."}
{"text":"I used to think healthy fast-food was an oxymoron. And then, I ordered take-out from Presto! 
Yum!
I had the turkey club sandwich. The cranberry walnut bread they use made this sandwich 5-star worthy.
My husband ordered the steak risotto salad, & it was even better than my sandwich, if that's possible?!

The finishing touch was the smoothie I ordered. 
A few days after I ate here, we went to Rachel's Kitchen. A restaurant with a similar menu, but definitely not similar service! My experience at Rachel's kitchen was abysmal! I'd recommend this place 1000 times over Rachel's Kitchen."}
{"text":"The service here was really great! They helped us decide what to eat and were very accomodating. The food was fresh and very tastey. I really am looking forward to seeing the business grow and trying more items on their menu."}
{"text":"We were served on actual plates with real utensils. The setup of the restaurant gives you that fast food feeling. However, the food is fresh. I don't believe the food they serve has ever seen a freezer or a deep fat fryer. I wish there were more places like this one."}
{"text":"Debbie and I had decided on Settebello, but decided on Presto Café near mi casa since the parking lot was ridiculously jam packed.  I have never tried Presto Café before so we decided to go there.

This place is small and quaint.  There were about 7-8 tables there, 2 and 4 tops.  Debbie and I decided on the 3 scoops for $8.75.  Very reasonable for the amount and quality of food.

1. Ahi Salad with Quinoa - Very tasty.
2. Beet Salad - Red and orange beets.
3. Chicken curry - full of flavor.

That was our lunch and we were satisfied.  I will take Earl there next time.  And the best part of it is that it is only a couple of minutes away (well, 10 min walk) from my house!"}
{"text":"If you can find this place you will have discovered a hidden treasure. Went in this morning for breakfast and had their corned beef Reuben. My wife had the breakfast burrito and a salad. Everything was well-prepared and delicious.  If you're looking for some healthful bounty, you won't be disappointed if you direct that pirate ship to Presto."}
{"text":"So glad Presto Cafe opened on this side of town. I have had their food before and wanted to try something new. I had the following:

Tandoori Chicken Salad- one scoop was plenty to split as an app. Flavorful chicken with mango, cucumbers, onions, papaya and coconut. Each ingredient played a role in the dish without one overwhelming another

Ahi sliders- three sliders with a cabbage slaw and sesame ginger sauce. I like ahi  sliders and these were good. I would order them again.

No pasta Vegetarian Lasagna- my wife ordered this because I wasn't brave enough and I'm glad she did. Filled with sweet potato, kale  and eggplant and topped with a delightful creamy sauce this dish was legit and it was gluten free. 

We were greeted by the staff when we entered and were asked if we have been there before and they offered to help with any questions we had."}
{"text":"First time at their Henderson location...We perused the menu and decided to share the Bianco Pide and the Turkey  Sandwich. The chef over heard that it was our first time here and told the guy who was taking our order to offer us samples of their salads in the case. He didn't...no biggie.

Our food arrives and the portions here seem a bit bigger than the Rainbow  location and equally delicious. Having a gym nearby, I'm sure people stop by for a post workout meal but this group that came  in looked like they came from Rehab at Hard Rock. Wrapped in  beach towels, fake goods ready to spill out, dropping  F bombs every sentence you speak while really saying \"look at me!, look at me!\" ...very pathetic...

There's a time and place for that kind of behavior and Presto Cafe isn't, but I guess the staff liked what they were seeing and hearing because nothing was done.
Other than that awkward situation for all of the other patrons, solid food at Presto...service needs a little work though...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Love the the Turkey Sandwich it is the best in Vegas.  From the bread to the egg!!  OMG what a combination!!  xo"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review due to a recent experience. My husband picked me up a pide for lunch and it was not good at all, the flavors were completely off and it was a mess. I called the store a couple hours later and told them what happened and they offered to make me a new one when I got off work. When I arrived the owner was very apologetic and kind. When he saw the pide I brought back he was very disappointed and said he would talk to his staff about it. Great customer service ! Thank you ! 

The BBQ chicken pide which is similar to a flat bread was much better this time and provided two meals because it's that big and filing. I still don't think their food is \"healthy\" but they are convenient and items are made to order. Try not to go during peak lunch and dinner times and the wait is about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This is what Henderson has needed for awhile.  Fresh pressed juices and gluten free culinary fare. The owners were personable and made my family and I feel like we were family. Everything is delightful including their delicious pides, sandwiches, and fresh salads with their products coming from locally owners venders that utilize sustainable practices. In addition, I am addicted to the morning fix smoothie. Bravo Presto!"}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend, and stopped by this new spot! It has healthy, fresh made food that is really good and affordable. I ordered the turkey sandwich which is super good on the cranberry walnut bread it comes with. I also had a side of their kale quinoa salad that is pretty tasty. Their pizzas look amazing too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I love that it is a little smaller and quaint, this allowed for a very personal touch.   I am allergic to tomatoes and they have a few pre-made salads, and I wanted the ahi tuna one but it had tomatoes.  The gentleman taking my order said he'd make me a portion for me without tomatoes. Amazing service!! I'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had for lunch today was AMAZING!  The cranberry nut bread that they used as the bread for my turkey sandwich was one of the most delicious breads I have ever eaten.  Where do they get this exotic food from?  Its perfect. Go there and enjoy - I did!"}
{"text":"Fresh made salad is amazing.  Very friendly service.  2 scoops of salad with a free range chx breast for 11 bucks.  The salad scoop choices are very extensive.  I had the kale quinoa feta tomato and the black bean corn avacado for the other scoop.  Enjoy a lunch that will energize your afternoon."}
{"text":"So I've been on a specific diet, so it's hard to eat out sometimes. Before I came here, I decided to check out the menu first so that I could find what I would eat.

I came here with the intention of getting salad, but asking to exclude the cheese and some other stuff. When I got the the restaurant I was a little disappointed to find that the salads were pre-made. Maybe, I should have been more thorough with my reading. 

Since I forced to pick something new, I decided on the marguerite chicken. I think it was faith because it was like crack. This dish was delicious. I usually get really full easily, especially now, but I ate the entire thing. The sauce on it was delicious. The asparagus was a little small, but that's okay. 

My friend got the sliders with meatballs. She said she liked it, but she ended up taking off most of the meatballs. I'm not sure if that's because she's a picky eater, or if it was just way too much meat. 

Atmosphere: the shop is a quaint little space. We came here on a Saturday at 5 and it was completely empty, which was surprising.

The staff was nice. The cashier was patient while I decided what to get, since it did take me awhile and she asked us if we enjoyed our food. She was pretty enthusiastic about it. I think I would come here again, but maybe not with specific intentions so I don't get disappointed.

This would have been a 5 star review, if they didn't pre-make the salad."}
{"text":"Love Presto! Service is great! Food is fresh so glad this place opened up in Henderson.  But a little faster for a freshly made smoothie would be a five stars!  Other than that love Presto!"}
{"text":"I was running errands in the area and decided to pop in for lunch. I ordered a breakfast wrap, which was delicious, as was the side salad that came with it. For the freshness and quality of food the price point can't be beat. It was the grand opening weekend so they were pretty busy but they were very good about turning over tables so there was room to sit in the cozy dining room. I'm looking forward to returning and trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the Blanco Pide (Pee Day). The ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was not overlooked at all. For a dish that's so simple and with just a few ingredients, it packed amazing flavor! I will be back, especially to try out the other Pide's :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Presto for the first time today and we really liked it! We had the ahi tuna sliders (delicious) and the Greek pide (also very good). I had never had pide before and really enjoyed the non-greasiness of the crust. I like pizza but I always end up using a million napkins to soak up the excess grease so the pide was such a great alternative for me. The service was good (I read a lot of complaints so I was a little worried it would take forever). My only complaint was that they pre-make all the salads and keep them in a cooler.  I initially wanted to order the ahi salad but I came to pick up the food around 3pm and I just didn't think the salad would be as crisp since it was sitting all day as if they made it fresh to order. I didn't try it though so I can't judge. All in all it was a nice lunch and I'm glad we have a healthy restaurant so close to home!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and made to order so be patient it takes a bit. You can sample anything they have in the window. Try the salad with seared tuna, amazing and healthy.   You can also stop next door for dessert on your way out."}
{"text":"Love Presto Cafe! What a treat to have a sandwich when you are gluten free and a delicious one at that! We brought our grandkids here and we all ate a wonderful lunch. They loved the food! The staff was so attentive and very nice.

We visit Vegas all the time as our grandson lives here so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I eat at Presto about 3 times per week, often bringing a friend with me and thus far everything we've tried has been amazing. The ingredients seem very fresh and the sides section is particularly impressive. Possibly the best turkey sandwich I've ever eaten. I find myself getting the ahi salad almost every time even though I usually think ahi tastes like a foot, that sure tells you something.

I usually just call it in for pickup and the wait times have yet to be much more than a couple minutes after I get there."}
{"text":"Great healthy comfort food.. So far everything I have tried was great.. The only down side to this place is the long wait is to get your food.. Your almost better to call ahead.. Other Tha  that great place to eat.."}
{"text":"Such a great place, food is amazing and service is equally as great. Staff is extremely knowledgeable of dietary needs and taste recos. Must haves; Israeli couscous is amazing (my 12 year old picky niece LOVED it, it has a great flair of truffle and Parmesan. Pide (pee-day) is a great option, the crust is light and the flavors bold. This is our new go to spot."}
{"text":"Not only closed permanently, but the next door business told us that the owner didn't even warn his employees....They came to the closed store and it was a surprise to them. SCUMMY."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I've had the porchetta and turkey sandwiches, each absolutely wonderful. The bread is so tasty and really makes the sandwich gone together. I've also had a couple of the juices - my own blend, each unique and yummy. I can't wait to try more things."}
{"text":"The smoothies, the breakfast sandwiches, the pides. All of them are delicious and healthy and fresh!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fresh. Quick. 

Got a breakfast burrito and scope of the ahi salad. A lot of these cafés mess up the breakfast burrito but these guys nailed it. Bill was 10 bucks. 

Little cramped. They should relocate by my house."}
{"text":"It's A MUST GO...OMG kind of place for your mouth to experience that WOW factor in service, food presentation & YUMMY from beginning to the last bite!! Thank you for the delicious Ahi Tuna in place of the Pan Seared Salmon!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food. I've been here after the gym a few times. I ordered the vegetarian lasagna and a smoothie. I couldn't even finish it! So so good. Today I got an ahi tuna salad. So fresh and colorful :) they have vegetarian options which is also a big plus!"}
{"text":"I took my hubs to Presto for his Bday, it was our first time there. The customer service was superb! The Presto Greek Salad has become our fav go to when I don't feel like cooking (which is often). Fresh, healthy!"}
{"text":"I tried the Ham & Cheese Please & a Wake Up Smoothie & both were equally an absolute delight. My favourite element of the Ham & Cheese Please was the pickled blueberries & cranberries it really made the sandwich stand out.

The service was amazing with all the staff very friendly & eager to help with any questions I had about the menu. I'll definitely be gracing this establishment frequently to work my way through the menu & I highly recommend it to all you other fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"The sign outside said healthy comfort food so why not after a workout, right? I ordered the lobster roll. It came with a little salad. I don't really eat fruits with my salad but it tasted fine. The lobster roll itself was pretty good! I'm not sure what oil they cook their food in but there was some type of oil oozing out of the sandwich and I'm not quite sure how healthy that was. Lol the steak and eggs my friend had had oil in it too. I'm sure it was fine but just the look of it was kind of weird. 

The service was okay. We got greeted at the door. Some of the workers weren't that knowledgeable of the food though. Also, after asking what a Nantucket roll was... the guy kinda gave us this weird, \"are you dumb?\" Look. Lol"}
{"text":"As much as I like local owned businesses that are coming into town, I will likely try this place a few more times. The first experience was not great as I was ordering to go mid afternoon after lunch. As I was curious to try this place I ordered their popular Blanco based on the cashier recommendation which is basically like a garlic cheese pizza on a soft wafer cracker. As this may not work for some people, this works for me as you'll see in my other review with settebellos. As for the pide or pizza, it was very good and a reason to return while some of the other healthy dishes looked really good to try also. My sister-in-law has also picked up a healthy green juices from here which were great too.

Now for the reason for the three star rating. Like I said, I ordered this to go after lunch mid day. While I waited for mine to be made, another local came in after my pide was in the oven. To reaffirm that my dish was very popular, he also ordered that Blanco which was nice to hear. Unfortunately, when it was time to serve that pide, he got his order three minutes after he ordered while I watch them make another Blanco. It was so dead in there that I don't see how they could have made that mistake. Maybe it was because he was a local or he was dining in while I was to-go.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to leave for about 25 minutes for a to-go order based on this mistake. I heard the Manager question the cashier on how long I've been waiting there since the manager was the one who served me my juice 20 minutes ago and watched the new guy finished his pizza while I just sat there waiting with my empty drink from 20 minutes ago.

Again, I will consider this a fluke and I enjoy a local places that are pushing for quality and health so this is why I will try again but I have my guard up."}
{"text":"Recently moving from LA to Vegas, I had to make a few sacrifices. One of those particular sacrifices was the abundant options for healthy, delicious eats... or so I thought! A friend informed me that Presto Cafe just opened up. I was skeptical due to having a high standard for quality healthy food, but my taste buds proved me wrong. I split an Italian pide with my friend and boy was it delightful. I'm a carbaholic so the fact that the dough didn't leave me feeling comatosed was a complete win in addition to the undeniably bold flavors. We also split the Israeli couscous with truffle, mushrooms and parmesan as well as a kale quinoa salad. I can't tell you which one I enjoyed more - well maybe the Israeli couscous due to my love for truffle, but hands down - two more yummy choices. If you're into healthy living with good eats, Presto Cafe is a must!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried at this place was delicious! It was our first time here so we ordered a variety of stuff: the Greek pide, the Reuben, Israeli couscous salad, ahi tuna salad and the veggie delight juice. The bread is made fresh. They are very welcoming and explain everything on their. I will definitely visit again to try the rest of their menu"}
{"text":"We stopped by for breakfast. We had the breakfast bowl and green eggs and ham. Both full of flavor. We want to try veggie lasagna. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great lunch Corned Beef sandwich rocked and the turkey sandwich was amazing- add the egg, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For my 100th review I wanted it to be some place awesome! Presto Cafe sure fit the bill. I got the chance to finally check out their new Henderson location this afternoon with my husband Joel. 

When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if this was our first time in. He gave us an overview of the menu and told us some popular dishes. Everything sounded amazing. I love that they serve breakfast all day. They also have some tasty sounding smoothies. In the end Joel ordered their Meatballs and I ordered the Ham & Cheese Please. We decided to share them. Joel's meatballs were so moist and tasty. He got three meatball sliders. The pesto mixed well with the homemade meatball and sauce. The buns were soft and melded perfectly with the meatball. My Ham & Cheese Please was out of this world delicious! It was piled high with Black Forest Ham, gruyere cheese, the most amazing pickled cranberry and blueberry compote, Funyuns, field greens, and chili mayo all this greatness on a bacon and cheese bread. Omg this was like the best sandwich ever!! They should totally bottle the pickled cranberry and blueberry compote. All the items in the sandwich really complement each other. This is truly an epic sandwich. 

Side note totally unrelated to the food or the chef.... While enjoying our meal I couldn't help but over hear, who I thought was the owner,  loudly making negative remarks to his friends about a similar competing business in the area (I'm not going to say which). Just a reminder to keep it classy. :) 

With all that said I'll totally be back in to try all the other wonderful things on the menu."}
{"text":"So happy to have this healthy eatery option right by our house.
Hubby & I went for an early lunch today. I was craving a fresh juice, he wanted to try one of their smoothies & we thought we'd share something as well. 
I got the Veggie DeLite Juice, hubby got the Morning Fix smoothie & we shared the Ahi sliders with a scoop of the Ahi salad. 
Everything was great & I can't wait to go back & try some more of the menu items! The hangar steak chimichurri & pan-seared salmon are at the top of my list & the sandwich options all seemed pretty decent as well. 
There wasn't anybody else eating there while we were there. I think 2 people came in tho, 1 for coffee & 1 asking for a menu which they didn't have. I really hope this place does well, it's tucked away in a shopping center that doesn't get too much traffic. Def bookmark this place & make it one of your regular stops, we need more restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"I walked in here expecting a pretty good gluten free menu and they only had a few options. I ended up having the turkey sandwich which was okay and the portions were fairly decent, but my friend had one of the pide's (I don't remember which one) but then we got home (after not eating anything else) and he starting throwing up for the rest of the night. I believe he got food poisoning from this restaurant. The restaurant also didn't appear to be too clean and there were workers fighting in the back. One punk worker came into work and just changed in the back. They all seemed to be hanging out by the bathrooms. Just a weird vibe, and the food poisoning, I was very disappointed. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"So the employee I referred to my review change his name and profile picture. A few minutes ago he message me again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated! How can you say it's fresh when the salads were stored?  Cashiers are not knowledgable in taking orders! She missed one order apparently it's too busy for them because there's only 2! While there's 7 people waiting for their food.  An hour wait for your to go is NOT ACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"This place has the feel of a great coffee shop,  with leather padded seatting (Even the high tops) but worth healthy foods & a juice bar instead of coffee.  Just finished a wonderful meal with my boyfriend.  I started with the kale, cashew & cranberry salad that was full of flavor.  Then I had the protein burrito filled with steak, quinoa, avocado & arugala. My boyfriend had the Ruben on a raisin walnut bread. Everything is made fresh daily & it shows. The staff is very friendly & helpful.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After doing an awesome YOUTUBE chest & tri workout by MIKE CHANG (HEY MIKE!), I didn't want a girly salad or grilled chicken and brown rice DAMNIT! I wanted some red meat! I stopped by Presto Cafe and when I looked at the menu my intuition told me--DONT DO IT. But--of course I didn't listen and I ordered the Hanger steak. At first I was excited because they told me they cook it to medium rare and I was drooling over having risotto. When I arrived at home, my steak was NOW well done due to \"carry-over\", and something about it didn't seem healthy. I need to double check the calorie count if its on the menu, but that green Pesto was VERY oily. The risotto was flavorless, but ok--S&P can fix that--but how much cheese was added to it???
Believe me--I'm not an excessive calorie counter, but I don't like excess oil, butter, etc.
I don't know. I was just getting major bad vibes. 

So, I mixed the pesto and OH LORD WHAT DID I DO THAT FOR? Whatever they put in the pesto--it was soooooooo sour! It was like there was a vinegar added. I've never had pesto taste like that, nor have the ones i've made tasted anything like that. I picked at it and beat myself up for not listening to my \"first mind\". Ughhhhh....$14.00 down the drain. I kept it the next day hoping the flavors would marinate and taste better--um NO. Maybe this is one of those spots where you have to give it another chance--but I honestly can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"First time here and it was good.  Small business feel which I loved. Appreciated seeing the owner working his ass off and you could taste it.  Got the porchetta sandwich and it was awesome.  The wife got the turkey, seemed a little short in the meat department but see really enjoyed it. Wow the kids pizza is a great value.  My son cleaned the plate though. I tasted it and it was ok, doe was a little chewy for my liking but I guess I may be turning it to a stupid food snob.  Overall I will be back, especially to try breakfast."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE, so much, I just want to eat here everyday! The food is delicious, always fresh as can be, creative, healthy, and soooo good! I am in love, RUN don't WALK to eat here, and tell Reza I sent you. You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times for lunch and love it.  yes, the wait can be a little long, even when not busy, but they make everything to order and it is delicious.  Don't come here for a fast meal.  Love the free wi-fi.  I can hang out here for a bit rather than a noisy and overpriced Starbucks.  Give this place a chance and some time to get themselves working on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Close to work, I am so pleased that Presto Cafe has opened a Henderson location at Stephanie and the 215, offering their healthy options on this side of town.  If you've never been to the Presto in Southwest Vegas, you probably don't know that PC offers up breakfast, sandwiches, coffee, smoothies, juices, salads, and pides (Turkish flatbread, pronounced 'pee-day').  There are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free items on the menu, something for everyone.  I met Shirley B. here for a late lunch and we both had sandwiches, turkey for me and the vegetarian for her, plus she had their beet salad.  Both sandwiches were a nice size, easily big enough to have one half now and the other half later; that's what Shirley did, but I was piggish and ate the whole thing there.  Consisting of turkey, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mayo on a toasted cranberry walnut bread, PC's turkey sandwich is an especially hearty and tasty version of an item that tends to be boring at most places. 

Located in the same shopping plaza as Gold's Gym, I'm sure the fitness fanatics are happy that PC is here, too.  It's also right next door to Gimme Some Sugar, so if you want to be fit first, then a little fat later, you can kill two birds with one stone.  

Open from 8:00am-8:00pm daily."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, rounded up because I feel generous.

I've had this place bookmarked since they opened, but never seem to make it.  Finally, over the weekend, my Mom and I found ourselves starving and we decided to check out Presto Cafe.

First, it's in an easy to find location, just off Stephanie/215, in the Golds Gym center.  There is plenty of parking.  One note - if you are on Stephanie, heading East, you won't be able to turn directly in to the center.  You will have to make a left at Paseo Verde.

Upon entering, I was surprised at how small the place was.  There are just 3 low tables in the front (kind of cramped), and then maybe 5 or 6 high top tables along the wall.  It's tiny and although only one other table was seated when we entered, if quickly became crowded.

I was taken a bit back by the prices.  I understand using quality ingredients is more costly, but I'll never understand why 2 sandwiches and 2 small drinks costs more than $23!  That's really my only knock on this place....

For the food:

My Mom ordered the Ham and Cheese Please - Local smoked ham, gruyere cheese, Blueberries, Funions, field greens, Chili Mayo on rustic bacon cheese bread.  She really enjoyed it.  I tried a bite and really liked the addition of the Funions and chili mayo.

I had the B. Ruben - Corned Beef, cabbage slaw, gruyere cheese, Russian Dressing on a Rustic Raisin Rye bread.  I really enjoyed it.  I can't say that I've ever had a raisin rye bread, and it was a great complement to the other ingredients.  I might even say that this was one of the best ruben's I've ever had!

Each sandwich was served with a small side of greens, which were mostly forgettable.

The special of the day was Chilean Sea Bass, which was $15.95.  That just seems outrageous to me! This is basically like a fast(er) food type place, and although everything is made to order (I hope), I don't think the prices reflect the atmosphere or location.

The service was friendly and there wasn't a very long wait for our food, but we started out as the only people in the restaurant. I think the people who came in after us waited awhile, because we saw them much later next door.

Anyhow, everything was good and I can generally bite the bullet and pay extra for fresh, somewhat healthy food."}
{"text":"New joint near my work and decided to give them a try. 

Place is decent. You could dine in or have it for take out. The customer service is excellent. 

We ordered Steak Hanger and Seared Salmon... ((0-o)) I'm in love!! 

The Steak was tender and It was perfectly made!

My wife had the salmon and she was satisfied...(picky eater). 

They also serve smoothies, pizza, sandwiches etc...

Came in the 2nd time and ordered \"Ham and Cheese Please\" and \"Tuna Slider\". 

Man! To die for !!!!! My mission now is try everything on their Menu!!!"}
{"text":"Even though it takes a long time for your food to come out, I still gave this place 5 stars. Their food is just amazing and their smoothies are PERFECT! The only thing that could make this place better is if they sold Acai bowls.  #OnPoint"}
{"text":"I tried the Greek Pide and Steak & Eggs 

Both dishes were fresh made and delicious!! The staff was super friendly I will be a regular here"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch to try something new since I saw there business on one of the yelp highlights and ordered something different, even though I should have read a little better, a veg sandwich and once I took the olives off I liked it. I did help my significant other eat his pizza thing and that was pretty different and good too! Thanks."}
{"text":"Did not care for this place. We were the only ones in there and it still took 20 minutes to get our food, We ordered two of the vegetarian lasagna and one salad. It looked they just threw it in the microwave so not sure what took so long. The total was over $25.00 which seemed a little high. 

The lasagna was actually pretty good but not worth a 20 minute wait with no other customers there. Can't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here this morning. We chose the bowl and biscuits and gravy.  The food was absolutely phenomenal, amazing flavors. Customer service was excellent, very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be frequenting here!"}
{"text":"The green eggs and ham flatbread was to die for. Also love the lobster roll....it's so authentic. Love the fact that this place is a scratch kitchen and healthy. Also love the portion sizes. Service is good but the true star here is the food and the creativity."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place and probably need to come a couple more times to form a really solid opinion, but for now it is A-OK.

Service: the first time I came, their credit card swiper wasn't working so they were only accepting cash. the second time I came, the guy working was stoned or tired or both, but friendly and helpful enough. 

Food: I had the greek pide, which was really good. However, the first time I came, my green eggs & ham flatbread came out pretty badly burnt. Big no-no. If food is burned, they should apologize for the delay and remake it; restaurants should not serve burnt food! 

So, final rating still TBD; I'll keep coming back because they are close and convenient and I like the IDEA of their food, but for now, \"ehhhh\""}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful, and healthy food. Lots of choices and I will be back to try more. Service was friendly and helpful."}
