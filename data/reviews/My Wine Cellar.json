{"text":"I recently hosted a friend's birthday party at My Wine Cellar and it was fantastic!  Zoya was super helpful in getting our night arranged.  We had half of the back patio reserved for us, and when we arrived, it was set up just perfect with a large table for food & drinks.  The staff was very friendly and attentive all night, everyone raved about the food - we ordered the flatbreads and the cheese/meat tray.  The back patio is so lovely with the lights and golf course view.  Plus Zoya helped to arrange for us to have special live music that night too - such a treat!  Great wine & beer selection - there was something for everyone.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I have not been here in a long time and the hubby and I went with a couple friends. Good wine and beer list and dinner was very good. I had the creamy shrimp pasta and it was good, but for the price the portion should have been bigger. The hubby had the burger and it looked delish! He asked them to substitute jalapeños for the bourbon mushrooms and the were happy to accommodate. The salmon patties were very good and decent sized. We also ordered a meat and cheese board for am appetizer. We had the prosciutto and the lamb jerky and both were excellent, but again the portion sizes could be bigger. They had a live jazz band playing (it was saturday night) and it was nice, not to loud. We were there on a very rainy night and even still the place was busy. Very friendly service....I can see why this place has been around for so long!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here on Friday afternoons to enjoy good wine and really great food! The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is great. It's local and close to home. Nice neighborhood hangout. This place also has great happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out because I had heard such great things. My husband and I decided to pick this place for our date night a few Saturdays ago. We arrived at about 5:50 (10 minutes before Happy Hour ended) We thought we would order a glass of wine each and a brushetta board before HH wrapped up and then order off the menu. We sat until 6:08 before someone finally greeted us. It was super awkward too because every server kept looking at us and making eye contact but no one ever cared to come by and get a drink order. Finally greeted,  I asked the waitress if we could order a few items from the HH menu because we sat down prior to it ending - she acted as if I was asking for too much \"Ummmm I can't access those buttons after 6pm I'll see if that's even possible\" as if I was in the wrong for asking! Our brushetta came out promptly however, it was much less in taste then I expected. They only had 4 selections and you picked 3 to complete your board - not much variety. The tomatoes were slimy to the point I had to undress each piece just to stomach it. Wasn't pleased. I ordered the prosciutto and brie flatbread and my husband had the salmon cakes - both were good. 

I most likely will not return to this place due to the lacking service and experience and the food being just OK. Hopefully I was there on an off night."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a few years, and it is still terrific.  Delicious small plates (we did fried chicken and frites) and the lobster bisque was amazing.  We enjoyed the happy hour specials and the feature wines.  We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The manager, Samantha, really needs a lesson in customer service. Completely rude!"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour, good selection on wine and beer.  The staff is also very friendly.  Defintely will be going back here often."}
{"text":"This little wine bar saved our date night! They provided wonderful service, great prices, live music and the perfect ambiance for a romantic evening. They had a great wine selection with very reasonable prices. We did not have any dinner here, but enjoyed the delicious Nutella S'mores for dessert. I would highly recommend this for a relaxing evening out."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio & live musics--super sweet & romantic. Good wine--but it was super spendy for not that great/size portion of food. Also, the \"free snack\" option from yelp is inactive apparently. 

It was OK. Not as good as Salut Wine Bar in Tempe, AZ."}
{"text":"First if you are looking for some sort of sprockets snotsdale wine snobby place then just turn around and keep heading up i-10.  If you are looking for a more relaxed \"Cheers\" type setting where you will be warmly greeted, treated like family, and have a great time then come on in and make yourself at home. 

We have been going to this place for years both in the newer location and the original one down the street.  The owners Tommy and Kathleen have NEVER strayed us wrong when we look for certain bottles of wine.  

Yes you will pay more than if you go to Costco or Cost Plus but I can't remember the last time either of those had a knowledgeable sales staff that remembers that I like sweeter white wines or big full bodied reds but not Merlot.  (Although I do remember the Costco lady handing me a 2nd free sample of crackers once....)

Yes it can get loud.  Yes the owners are warm and friendly.  Go a few times and you will become one of the family.  They have great wine makers who stop in an do tastings.  When was the last time you saw Mark Mondavi (Charles Krug winery - nephew of Robert) at your small wine store?    

Their prices range from 7-12 a glass of wine and 20-200 for a bottle.  You may find it cool in there (hey it IS a WINE store and with that much inventory you wouldn't want it to go bad in a warm place!) so bring a light sweater of jacket."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to hang out. Everyone here is friendly & fun! Great wine selection and good food. They have a really nice patio & live music Fri and Sat.

I would also recommend taking advantage of their monthly wine club. Each month I get two (or you can get 3) bottles of curated wines & have been able to try a lot of wines I otherwise wouldn't. Plus you get club discounts!"}
{"text":"Um, pretty much the perfect place for date night... First dates, thousandth dates, last date, whatever. Amazing patio, great music(cheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape), great wine selection, and awesome food! I love their bruschetta's . 

The service is speedy and low key, you don't have to worry about someone hovering, but when you need that next glass, they are there with a suggestion. Professional and knowledgeable. 

The owners are great. I think every time I have been there(a lot) one of them has stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was great. I know this place has just transferred ownership, and MAN they are doing everything right. It was good when I first started going, and now it is GREAT! 

Totally recommend to anyone looking to take a date to a classy place that is reasonably priced, where you can make it a long night if things are going well, and a short night if she sucks."}
{"text":"I spent several evenings at My Wine Cellar while vacationing in Phoenix last month.  The appetizers were delicious and the wine choices many.  The service was excellent and the patio beautiful!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Comfortable setting, great service, amazing food, breathtaking views. All on one spot. Absolutely a great place to wind down. Highly recommended during happy hour. Prices and variety are unreal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of our favorite places to relax and enjoy a good glass of wine (or three). We usually make it a date night and go on Friday nights because we like the live acoustic music. It's not too loud to still have a conversation, even if you're sitting close to the talent. I love the atmosphere - when it's cooler, it's nice to sit around the fireplace and cozy up! 

We seem to always get the same waitress when we go, but she's fabulous! She is very knowledgable and always makes great recommendations. 

My husband loves good beer, and they have a really impressive beer selection, too.

The food's great, too. It is a little on the expensive side, but we typically just do a couple apps to share. 

Overall, it's a great little gem and I would have never found it had it not been for Yelp!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to enjoy an excellent wine or beer selection is My Wine Cellar on the north side of Warner Rd between I-10 and 48th St! Whether I'm looking for a private tete a tete table, a perch up at the lively bar or a couch around the fire table out on the patio the staff will go out of their way to accommodate my wishes. New owner, Zoya, never misses an opportunity to express what's new on the wine list or menu ( which is updated seasonally ) to pique my interest.

Chef Sarah is a genius in the kitchen! Please do yourself a favor and order her  Belgian Fries - perfection! Cheesy Welsh Rarebit was better than mom made! Sorry mom! 

At the most recent Wine Paring Dinner, Chef Sarah and Zora did a fabulous job of flawlessly matching the wines to the fixed menu. True art blends line, form, texture and color together. Now add flavor and true art is what Chef Sarah served! Delicious hors d'oeuvres, salad, scallops, osso bucco and a delectable chocolate caramel dessert! Conversation was lively, service was seamless! Clearly, the entire staff was committed to making the evening very special for its diners.

That's what makes this wine bar better than any other I've been to in recent years - attention to detail, great wine, food and the company!"}
{"text":"I'm here now, enjoying the Maryvale Chardonnay on happy hour, which is an amazing wine that they serve in a red wine glass, and you'll know why when you taste it. I love this place! The staff is friendly, the food is wonderful, I recommend the crab dip..just a really amazing place, with a beautiful patio right on a golf course and truly a wine-hound's little paradise."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It's quaint and nice. Some of the food is good. Depending on who you get, sometimes the service is slow"}
{"text":"Something went wrong here tonight. $10 for 8 olives and chicken was borderline jerky. Carrots on veggie plate were both burnt and raw at the same time (this takes true skill at disrespecting food) 

The salad was reasonable;but again, chicken seemed to be leftover microwaved bits and pieces from some earlier attempt at drying chicken.

The wine selection is laughable for a place with wine in the name. Some places make their money with excellent food and wine. This place makes money charging $40 for a $8 bottle of wine. Pathetic. 

This will be our last visit here."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously???? It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me? We had to go up to the bar to get the check. It's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out. We will not return here. Very unfortunate for us and them."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Great for happy hour with a small group if you're just walking in or reserve a spot for larger group! Love the atmosphere and the art work. It's very  cozy and comfortable. We got a bottle of wine to share and two of the flat breads- all was SO yummy we were fighting over the last piece! The outside patio was also great with  a fire pit and singer and a lot of couches and comfortable chairs. From the outside this place doesn't have the best curb appeal, but once you go inside you will be pleasantly surprised! Our server was very knowledgeable on all the wines we asked about and a lot of fun and attentive!"}
{"text":"We love stopping here for a glass of wine, either inside or on their great patio! Their wine selection seems to change up now and then, so that's nice. I've seen the same servers their over the past few years and they're always super-friendly. Overall, it's a nice local hangout."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for a simple girls chat session... Amazing! Have returned many times and have now \"claimed \" this spot as my local wine spot!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great vibe and bar.  Very chill & just perfect for conversation, food, & of course wine.  Their selections change periodically, which I like in a wine bar.  The low key setting and knowledgeable staff make you want to return for more.  Great pizzas too. Patio is fantastic...& the live music on weekends is great!

Sweet spot in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Gotta love Lucy's! And I do! Great selection of wines, yummy snacks and \"bar pies\" - really, where else can you go for a $100 wine and pizza? I say that a bit sarcastically - as I always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really, life is to short to drink bad wine!  My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucy's cause I am not a cheap date there, but he likes it too. He even threw a surprise bday party for me there, recently - and it was all perfect. The back patio is super when the weather is nice, and they have cozy couches inside, or a table if you prefer. Check it out, it's fun!"}
{"text":"Voices for CASA Children held our December meeting and Board appreciation at MWC for the second consecutive year. Zoya is very personable and helpful with menu and wine selections. The Brushettas and charcuterie she recommended were amazing. The flatbreads were outstanding and yes, the roasted brussels sprouts are a must try!  We selected a variety of wines and each one was lovely. There is a classic and comfortable atmosphere at MWC. I am also an Ahwatukee Foothills resident and I am pleased to have MWC in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, friendly atmosphere and great happy hour specials. If you are looking for a place to enjoy a nice glass of wine and live music then this is your place."}
{"text":"Very AVERAGE wine selection for a 'wine bar.'. That started our lackluster experience. Ordered the hummus plate... Three types (a tablespoon of each) a pita, few shreds of cucumber and a nice pile of NASTY dried out carrots.  - 1st issue = $9 for what I would have guessed to be $5 worth.  2nd Issue = asking the waitress to replace the nasty carrots with more cucumber.  When she brought the cucumber a WHILE later I recommended that they really should not serve food like that!  Her response, \"they said they just received them today!\" Soooo they bought the crappy dried out carrots -- not ME!  Would they serve food with bugs on it next...if they just got it today?!  What an excuse.  Well now I dont need an excuse not to go back!!!  Save yourself - try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"For being located on the ass-end of Ahwatukee, this place charges an arm-and-a-leg for a glass of wine. Bottles are steep. Food is pretty good, but pricey. Why can't someone make a wine bar that is just regular priced? Very inconvenient parking."}
{"text":"Decent place, friendly staff, but poor wine list.  I asked the staff about the list and was told the owners only want to carry wines that nobody else does.  My guess is that they want to carry wines that you are not familiar with so you don't know how badly you are getting ripped off.  I had a $10 glass of a $11 bottle of wine (retail).  It was ok, and I expect high prices at a bar but I at least want a decent glass."}
{"text":"Attended a friends birthday dinner at this establishment. I was very impressed with their wine menu and the knowledgebase of all the servers. Wonderful bruschetta and many things for me to eat, which is tricky because I'm a vegetarian.i've been back a few times now and I'm always impressed with thevservice."}
{"text":"I just spent my Mothers Day celebration at My Wine Cellar for high tea. I was so disappointed. The first irritation was being rushed because as we were told the tea is \"timed\". The service continued to be unfriendly. The doors were open and it was very warm and flys began to swarm. Still happy and being tolerant. Then the food began to come. The scones and presentation were beautiful but the lemon curd was like thick gelatin. Still okay enjoying my family. The next course was the sandwiches. They were basically grocery store sandwich meat on cheap white bread. Two of us ordered the tea and on top of the sandwiches were three old tarts and one eclair. Nothing was fresh and there were not even two of each. The mimosa orange juice was from a concentrate. The cost was $55 and it was worth at the most $10. Totally we spent $160.00 for a school cafeteria lunch. I want a refund so that my kids and I can try to have a real Mother's Day celebration.   Oh-the live music was fantastic. He was so good and we tipped him well."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love my wine cellar, its become something we look forward to weekly! They have an amazing patio that overlooks the golf course and is dog friendly, which is not so common in Ahwatukee. The food is absolutely wonderful, and the atmosphere is spot on. I also love that they have live music on the weekends and sometimes during the week. Would highly reccomend this local spot to anyone looking for a nice relaxing good time!"}
{"text":"1st timer here. Live music, few couples, kinda no vibe for a weekend night, just right.
Sometimes just right is not what I'm looking for from a wine bar but is just me.
The staff is friendly and the service is fast. 
We ordered food with fancy names but not that fancy taste."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The brushetta was cold and it took them 40 mins to bring it out.  The manager that wanted to discuss the problem with was very confrontational."}
{"text":"We have given this place a handful of chances over the years, but we still have mixed feelings about it. We live nearby and would love a fun place to walk to, so we keep giving it more chances. Our experience:

1. The service has always been good. Waitresses are very friendly and service is good. The atmosphere is fun too. 

2. The food is OK. Flatbreads are good, but if you have ever been to Postino's do not get your hopes up for the bruschetta- it's very small and uneventful. They may want to step it up a notch. 

Overall it's not a bad place. They need to just step it up on some of the food based on the price you pay for it."}
{"text":"One of the gems of Ahwatukee! Hidden discreetly in an old strip mall, MWC hits you with an unexpected, fresh dose of casual classiness as soon as you enter. Comfy couches, nice lighting, great little patio overlooking a golf course, suuuper friendly and attentive staff, and a pretty good happy hour make this place awesome in my book.
Wine selection exceeds my palate, and they even have an eclectic offering of microbrews for beer drinkers like myself.  Haven't tried the fare, so no opinion on the food. Highly recommended if you find yourself on a date...great place to enjoy conversation and a glass of fermented grapes."}
{"text":"Cool spot we randomly found on yelp. The wife got a salad, which she modified and thought it was pretty good. I had one of the flatbread pizzas which was awesome. Of course they have a huge wine selection, of which neither my wife or I indulged in. They also have some good craft draft beers which I did enjoy. Overall, cool place with some solid food choices. Skip the chain restaurants and go here instead."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for live music and a glass of vino. We didn't have any food, it was a pit stop on the way to dinner. small establishment, but nice and cozy. we will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't know where to start...I LOVE this place.  It is located on Warner Road and pretty easy to miss - very unassuming place.  But once inside I was impressed.  Very welcoming and unpretentious atmosphere and the wait staff is friendly and efficient.  The food...forget about it!!   Absolutely awesome and reasonably priced (catch Happy Hour and food prices are even better).   I can't say enough about the uniqueness and quality of the food.  Check out the menu before you go.  It is not full-course meals but an array of unique \"small plate\" salads, meats, cheeses and awesome, unique dishes. You'll want to share because you won't want to miss tasting everything.   
I was lucky enough to be there when the weather was perfect (typical October weather in Phoenix) and spent time on the patio.  Great spot.  Live music, view of the golf course, plenty of umbrellas for shade during the day and a fire pit in the evening!
I had mixed emotions about writing this review.  I don't want too many people to find out how great this place is because I don't want it to get over crowded...yet I want them to continue to be successful because it's such a great spot to eat and drink.  I could tell there were a lot of \"regulars\" there and they were a friendly, welcoming crowd.  Try this place out...bet you become a \"regular\".     Oh yeah, don't forget to say hi to the new owner Shannon.  She's always wandering around making sure everyone is happy and she also welcomed ideas to expand and improve the menu - she's obviously a Foodie.
If you don't check this place out you're nuts."}
{"text":"This is my first to visit this place, though I've passed it several times. My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  \"It takes two\" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said \"Classsssy!\" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it. At least we gave it the good college try."}
{"text":"Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood spot!  I often pop in for the after-work happy hour and fell in love with the atmosphere, the great wine and the staff.   I have even been participating in their monthly wine club -- a great way to expand your wine repertoire. When the weather is cooler, grab a seat on the outdoor patio for some amazing sunset golf-course views.   Be sure to try the spiced nuts!"}
{"text":"My Wine Cellar is owned and staffed by knowledgeable, friendly, and genuine people. The food is great and pairs well with the extensive wine list. There is also a selection of craft beers on tap for the non-oneophilea of your group.  There is a wine club to join, wine classes to attend, and local artists on display.  This is a classy joint that is great for your happy hour with your colleagues, date with your lady, or just to catch up on SportsCenter on the tele with your lonesome."}
{"text":"Interesting spot. Live music most days. Tapas, wine and various beers. Location is off most routes. Give it sometime. We were a little slow. But, worth a try."}
{"text":"Ok-- if you're a local, come back, because the new ownership has upgraded this place 100%. The food has good from embarrassingly weak to fantastic. I'm very happy that Ahwatukee has a great place for wine and appetizers, shared plates or a dinner. Coming back. Like tomorrow maybe."}
{"text":"Love it! Great date night place. Wine, cheese, and meats, how can you go wrong? Love gluten-free options. The live music was great too! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our friends invited us to join them at My Wine Cellar for their Wine Club's monthly wine club event.   To join the club you commit to a six month membership at $35/mo for 2 bottles of wine of their choosing or $55 for 3 bottles per month.  If you attend the wine tasting you have to pay an additional $15 for that. 

If you're not a member the wine tasting costs $20 per person to taste 3 wines and eat some appetizers that are paired with the food.  We thought we'd sit in on this session and decide to join after the experience.

We were not impressed and we did not join.  This is why:  At each wine club event, three wines are showcased, two reds and a white.  Their wine expert stands on a little stool and yells out a story about each wine, it's origin, etc.  I had difficulty hearing what she said.  Then the servers come out and give you a piece of food to go with the first tasting. We got 2 oz of white wine and one shrimp wrapped in prosciutto.  The second tasting of red was paired with one piece of flatbread with chorizo (2x2 square) and the final tasting of red was served with a ice cream the size of a melon ball.  All that for $20. 

We decided to order an appetizer and a bottle of wine (not sure why we did this).  We got a nice red and quesadillas.  The latter came out warm with a blob of melted orange plastic in between two limp tortillas.   There was about 2 oz of steak. Bland, no flavor at all.  The only thing good about it was the lime infused sour cream.  

Our final bill for the \"wine tasting\", appetizer and bottle of wine plus tip?  $90!!! 

We could have had a nice meal almost anywhere for that.

The owner was very brash--joking let's get them drunk so they will sign up for the club.  She asked us a few times if we were going to join.  

I don't recommend joining this club and I don't recommend that you go there.  The food is okay.  There are other wine bars that do this better such as The Living Room."}
{"text":"The service was really slow. They were really understaffed. Just to let everyone know the free yelp snack is popcorn or peanuts- I cant remember what she said bc neither sounded appetizing. Happy hour prices aren't that great considering the small amount of food u get. We needed almost 3 appetizers each and we are both slim. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is an awesome wine bar with great food, music and atmosphere!  The staff is very friendly and provide great service.  
Also a great place for a Saturday date night.  I especially enjoy the wine pairings as part of the wine club with live music outside on the patio."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited My Wine Cellar just a little bit ago and loved it! The staff was on point the entire time from greeting us to serving us. The atmosphere is very quaint and inviting.  Since I am not an expert on wine the server was so helpful with explaining everything and guided my husband and I to great choices. Nice variety btw. Our food was very tasty. It all arrived promptly too.  We were on the hungrier side so had a variety of things such as the meat and cheese platter, flatbread pizza, salmon dish and dessert. YUMMMY! While enjoying our food and wine, there was live music in the background. Just the right touches of what my husband and I like to make us go back."}
{"text":"A bit frustrated as we drove all the way over here to meet some friends. Our friends were at the bar waiting for us but there was a lady at the door not allowing us in because they someone was having a 'rehearsal dinner.' They put a sign on the front door, 'we've reached maximum capacity' and that was just tacky. If you're having a private party or special event, turn off the OPEN sign and put a sign up that says Private Event Tonight."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. It's one of those places that if you blink, you will probably miss it! I was one of those people until a co-worker of mine suggested it, been coming here ever since! I'm a fan of this place for happy hour (3-6pm)! They have a nice selection of wines and craft beers and their happy hour pricing is pretty good as well! The owner and wait staff are very friendly and talkative! They are always giving great suggestions on wines and beers to try.
If you have a work event and want to do something a little different, this is a great place to try! I had a small work function last fall and it was a hit! They will set up food parings and wine or beer options specifically for your event. They can accommodate decent sized groups and when it's cooler out you can enjoy their patio that faces the golf course. 
I recommend the meat and cheese plates or their crab dip for an appetizer and their flat bread pizzas are really good as well!
They also have quarterly wine or beer paring dinner events! They usually bring in local breweries to pair their food with. Very cool idea if you are looking for a unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since I wanted to write this review. People are quick to drop a nasty line on Yelp, yet an objective review is hard to come by these days. It's like why would one bring friends, tell the owner throughout the dinner that the food is perfect, and then turn around and write a poor review? I wish I could weed those people and their reviews out of Yelp. So there you have it: I am after you (and you know who you are); after you with my objective reviews. My Wine Cellar is a place worthy of your attention. Tucked away in Ahwatukee Foothills and is worthy your attention. This place has a spirit, a personality, amazing staff and always changing scenery of foods, music, wines, social activities, people from all over the country borough together for the love of company or merely wanting to relax after a busy day in the city. I first discovered this place through Yelp and thanks to your reviews. I am a picky SOB born and raised in Europe and spoiled by wonders of Pacific NW. I am Anton from Ratatouille if you wish, and I found my joy in My Wine Cellar's wine club and meeting its members, participating in all social activities. So shall you! Please come and enjoy yourselves here. Phoenix is culturally a young city. Finding city gems is a treasure hunt for me. Love My Wine Cellar!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful party at this place last night for a friend.  The back patio is perfect for this time of year with a nice private and relaxing feel.  The food was creative and wonderful and the wine was the perfect temp.  

A musician by the name of Blaine Long was playing on the patio and the guy just blew me away.  All original music, great style and feel, and he knows how to control volume and tone so damn well.  Certainly the best musician I have heard in an Arizona bar/restaurant after living here for 15 years.  

I will certainly be back to experience an evening without the party.  The staff was very good and professional.  They thought of everything the guests could need including blankets for a baby when the temps dropped."}
{"text":"I've been to My Wine Cellar previously & wasn't very impressed with the experience. Since our friends wanted to try it out, we decided to go back. It was not at all busy when we went & were told we could sit at any table. We really wanted to sit outside but were warned that there's a golf course behind the restaurant, thus there is a mosquito problem.

We grabbed a table & our waiter came to greet us & take our drink order right away. I thought it was disgusting that he acknowledged that there was a mosquito squashed on the page of the menu but gave it to me anyway. I think that it wouldn't have taken much effort to go grab another menu. It was his first day I guess.

We got the Oatmeal Stout beer & the pink Moscato for drinks and the bistro burger & the salmon cakes for our meal. Both of the food dishes were good. The bistro burger was large & filling and the side of fries was also tasty. I think for the price we paid for the salmon cakes, it would've been nice to get an actual side instead of just the spring greens.

The service was fine. I've been to wine bars before & enjoyed them more so I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional happy hour food items (delicious bacons rapped dates and melted goat cheese spread!) and generous wait staff. In our time there, the tap blew for a beer we wanted so we got a free beer. Also, they mixed up our order and ended up giving us an appetizer on the house. All in all a great place with staff that are focused on making sure you have a good time while there."}
{"text":"My first time here after having my mom, who is a regular, rave about the place. Just loved the place, ambience is low key and way cool. Place was busy, but still could hear the amazing music, first streaming, then live AND have a conversation. I really can't comment on the wine bar selection because I don't really drink but my dinner companions seem to enjoy them. I can talk about the great ambiance and the wonderful food and varied menu that is available. Their lobster bisque soup is the best I've ever had. We had charcuterie and their bruschetta which was delicious. Service was wonderful. Owner herself came over to say hi. Overall great experience and definitely look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, inconsistent, and poor service. We keep wanting this place to work (we even joined the wine club but cancelling now) but this last time was the deal breaker. Walked up to have an appetizer and all of the doors were open so we walked in. The lady working turned us away because we were 14 mins early before they open. Don't open the doors if you don't want customers! Or at least invite us in to wait."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and atmosphere! The bacon and squash flatbread was out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has everything for the perfect date. They had a guy singing called Big White Cloud ? lol He was great, the service was perfect , the outdoor heaters are magical. I will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous chill little hidden gem! We have been about 3 times for happy hour. They offer $2 off some small apps, which isn't stellar, but something. The food is always fantastic! The goat cheese appetizer is our favorite! Great wine selection and they offer beer as well. The servers are attentive and knowledgable. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for an after work drink in a relaxing environment. They have a decent wine selection with a nice happy hour menu offering some really tasty treats. I love the bruschetta, particularly the brie, apple and caramelized onions - delicious!

The staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive. I sit on the patio almost every time and love it. They have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening. I've been on a Saturday night before and they had live entertainment - just a guy and his guitar - and it was the perfect touch to the already amazing atmosphere.

I also attended a networking event here for women in my industry and they handled it perfectly. The staff was spot on, offered perfect little bites and made it a very enjoyable event.

I really like how laid back and relaxed the environment is and am so happy it's so close to work that I can make it a regular spot to unwind."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with my mom and sister. Was greeted by the humans right campaign sticker on the front door which immediately put a smile on my face. We stuck to ordering a lot of drinks and appetizers that were on happy hour menu. They had a free appetizer for checking in which you can't argue with either. 

Lots of drinks to order from. Appetizers were amazing, service was great, always came back to check if we wanted more drinks or food. The only reason I docked one star was because the server assumed that my sister was my mom and that my mom was my grandma. It's a common mistake to make, but something no one should ever assume. 

Overall, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"For those of you with more eclectic tastes, this wine bar has a decent menu with snack food and entrees for you to enjoy with some great wines.  We had the house cab and house chard for $5 each.  The zucchini and chicken quesadilla appetizers were great.  Our total tab for light dining was less than $25.

This mom and pop establishment has a great outdoor seating area with a view of a neighborhood golf course.  We saw one patron bring in a small dog that was very well behaved.  She had a laptop so I assume that there might have been wifi available?

The server was attentive without being intrusive and the manager was very ingratiating as she visited each table.  They want to ensure that everyone enjoys the experience.

There was a TV but it was not in use.  For a sports fan it is not like a sports bar.  We were there for the happy hour but per their website they offer live entertainment.  Parking was easy for us since we were early. If you arrive late it might be more of a challenge; however, there is nearby parking for a short walk.  There is ample handicapped parking.

Groups larger than 4 or 5 may be in for a wait if it is busy.  The facility is small but well worth the visit.  Per their sign they open at 12:00 on Saturdays.  The Happy Hour ends at 6:00 Monday through Saturday."}
{"text":"I decided to go to My Wine Cellar to finish some homework and it was a great experience. I brought my laptop and the staff was more than accommodating. Ann, the bartender for the night, was very friendly. 

Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"If I had the time, I could eat here every night. The combination of the new chef (Chef David Laser from Cork) and the amazing staff serving his kickass food (he and Chef Mary Ann created an entire new menu), this dark horse of a restaurant will soon be the leader of this town's wine/food world. I have tried all the bruschetta and not one was unsatisfying (if you're up for trying something new, try the duck!!). The pizzas are amazing and if you ask me, are far better than Bianco's in downtown -- these aren't all hyped up! 

But of course, it comes down to a trio of things: atmosphere, food, & wine. My WIne Cellar has all three working for them in perfect unison. Service was great, the new owners are very friendly, and I love just being there!

But don't take my word for it, come in, eat for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date night or to do some classy day drinking. The food is really, really good. Bacon wrapped dates were excellent and the chartreuse board was pretty good too. Wine pours we're generous. Definitely adding this place to my rotation."}
{"text":"Amazing! Our first time here was wonderful. Delicious food and wine with cool live music. Beware that it gets pricey if you're paying for wine by the glass because you want to try them out. We left with an $80 tab, easy."}
{"text":"Great view, loved the patio! Wine and beer selections are solid. Went for restaurant week and the food was amazing!! Though they were out of the dessert that had convinced me to choose that place initially :( 

However, looking at their regular menu, I don't know if I'll be back. It's a little too like pub fare and doesn't really fit the atmosphere this place has, in my opinion. If they had more unique entrée and dessert options, like the ones on the restaurant week menu, then this place would be a definite go-to spot!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was great. Wonderful service and chef Sarah Baer was rock'n Our server Brittney  suggested a good spanish wine and sparkling sprite on the rocks. But the best part of the dinner was the amazing, teeth rotting s'mores with homemade marshmallow. I don't care if I have to gum my food for the rest of my life I would eat that homemade marshmallow all day long. Thanks for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Cute cozy lounge-like wine bar! Went there Friday night a few hours before they close. It was too cold to sit outside but it looked pretty. We sat at the bar. Great selection of wine. Their food menu looks very interesting! We decided to try their bruschetta - OMG so good! Especially the butternut Squash one! Nom nom! We are definitely going back and bring our friends next time!"}
{"text":"I have been to My Wine Cellar a few times since the change in ownership and I have to say I'm still not sure what to think. I love the idea of a cozy wine bar just a few blocks from my house and that is what this place seems to be. I walk in and the atmosphere is quite cozy and even though there is not a huge crowd of people. The bar is usually full enough and everyone is chatting and appears to be having a good time. Even though the staff is welcoming, I still get this feeling like I'm an \"outsider\" and not quite a \"regular\" yet. Can't really place my finger on why.

The happy hour prices and selection for beer and wine are fantastic! Full price would be a little more than I would like to spend, but then again I love a good deal so anything \"full price\" just seems like I'm missing out. We used Living Social coupon a few days before the expiration and were a little bummed that the coupon wasn't good for the happy hour prices. I know this is somewhat typical, however that just makes the restaurants that DO allow the coupons during happy stand out that much more!

In the time that I have had food (after the ownership change and before), I think it is obvious this place is all about the wine and the food is an afterthought. Nothing wrong with that. I think it is necessary to offer food if you want people to stay and drink a while; we've got to have something to snack on! Bruschettas, thin and crispy pizzas, and salads all with great descriptions on the menu, but the execution leave a little to be desired. Some of the appetizers taste like I could have just gone to Trader Joe's or Costco and purchased the same thing myself.

I promise I am not trying to make this sound bad, I will go back to the wine cellar when I want to relax (but not at home, but not too far away either) with a good glass of wine and a calm, cozy atmosphere. I do like to go there, but I think I like the idea more than the reality. It seems as if there is some unrealized potential at the wine cellar, or maybe that is just the optimist in me. The lesson here is that I will be sure to go during the \"happy\" hours and I won't go when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I came here for a Meetup. It was awesome! But I also have taken their wine classes here!! So glad I chose here to do it!!"}
{"text":"We were in search of a place with small plates and delicious wine - and My Wine Cellar fit the bill! As we walked in, I was pleased with the dimly lit and intimate space. And live music?! I was sold. With a thin strand of lights placed above the windows, this was the perfect way to wind down from a day of sightseeing. 

Because we weren't incredibly hungry, we opted for a few of their small plate options. We first opted for the Seared Shrimp + Kimchi Salsa, which included a rainbow carrot salad. Realizing we were still hungry, we then ordered a flatbread called \"The Livin' Easy,\" which had chef's barbeque sauce, chicken, red onion and cilantro. It's really hard to go wrong with ordering flatbreads ...  Both were delicious, but we were really hoping the Seared Shrimp + Kimchi Salsa would have been a LITTLE bit bigger considering it was under the \"shared plates\" category. Even so, we were both very pleased. 

As for the wine, they had everything your little heard could desire. I'm going say something that will surely offend the wine enthusiast reading this (although I DO love wine!), but I can't for the life of me remember the name of the wine we ended up getting. haha I know I first had my eyes set on The Curator, which was a Shiraz, but they were out. Thankfully our waitress was quick to find an earthy red for us that we both loved. And that's what I'll remember ... it was super tasty! 

All in all, it was a lovely experience and the live music really topped off the night."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it.

Whether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse, My Wine Cellar has you covered.  The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.  

If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers \"wine education\" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly \"Wine 101\" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.  Lots of fun and I learned a huge amount of information!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Such an awesome atmosphere. Great music, great food and great wine - what more do you need?  We also joined the Wine Club. Definitely recommend it. Great wines from wineries all over the world that you would never find and they are paired with delicious appetizers. It's a great way to meet new people. Everyone is so friendly and the owner Zoya is so nice and really tries to get to know everyone. You should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for a reason. Several, actually. First and foremost, I keep coming back because of the staff. I consistently get tailored service from staff members who take the time to get to know their guests. Second, I love the atmosphere. My Wine Cellar attracts a diverse clientele, and that makes me feel at home. Finally, I come back for the attention to quality. They sweat the details on food and wine, and it pays off."}
{"text":"Unique food offerings with great beverage selection, the patio is a great spot for adults to enjoy themselves!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this great spot last Tuesday night.. I live in S Tempe and have been craving a good wine bar .
Immediately felt relaxed as I walked in the door. I'm unsure what used to be here b4 but it has a huge bar space, which I love. Customers Chillen & actually conversing with each other .
Service was good, it was our waitresses first week and what she lacked on service skills she way made up for with an honest personality . I'm sure by now she has it all down. Super server in the making!
Wine list had a diverse selection but the food was I dunno how to describe it but I guess it was cool !!
Flatbreads were fresh and tasty, the dates filled with blue cheese wrapped in hickory bacon were amazing ! Will defo go back , great date spot too."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best neighborhood gems we have here in Awhatukee. The staff is super friendly and always has their best interest for their customers. It always feels like I'm surrounded by friends here. Great selection of wines for the aficionado or newbie. The food is yummy and make sure you check out the daily specials board!"}
{"text":"Outstanding view, amazing service, great wine selection, delicious food. Enough said? This place is awesome. The music selection is the best and it is filled with love and culture!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  The wine selections are nice and they have given me samples to try before I purchased a bottle. The employees have been very interested in customer satisfaction every time I have been there.  This is pretty darn good for having been there several times.
Everything I have eaten there has been enjoyable.
This is great place for date night, but not a first date, since if it doesn't work out you will want to keep this place as one of your gems to go and relax at.  It is also fabulous to go there with girl friends."}
{"text":"Between the great and friendly staff, their knowledge of wines and a constantly creative complement of unique beers, MWC is the perfect place to end the day.  Great food, live music and a fantastic patio for when the weather is perfect, like right now!"}
{"text":"One of the best glass of wine selections I have seen. The owner is very attentive to presenting good quality and excellently served wine. The happy hour food specials were tasty and delicious & an excellent value. The ambiance and people were nice and homey...they make me want to go back! Overall one of the best wine bars I have ever gone to!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here on and off for quite a few years. I believe they are currently the only wine bar in the Ahwatukee area. The Wine Cellar is tucked away off Warner Rd and the I-10. The welcoming staff, dim lights and display of artwork on the walls gives it a nice neighborhood ambiance. They have a large selection of boutique wines and craft beers. Behind the restaurant is a outdoor patio area with occasional live music. Its relaxing atmosphere makes it a great place for a date night or a quiet night out with friends. I've always enjoyed their selection of wines. They have some wine flights to choose from or you can order by the glass or bottle. I haven't had many opportunities to try their food. I went on a Wednesday and got their bottle of wine and flatbread for $25 (they have different specials on weekdays). I got the brie and prosciutto flatbread and thought it was pretty good. They also offer a wine club for regulars and 101 classes for those wanting to learn more about wine. Parking can a little tight up in the front but definitely a great place to stop if in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Why?  Because the staff is amazing, the atmosphere is quiet and welcoming, and the wine is delicious!! I met with a friend whom I haven't seen in a while and we had a lot of catching up to do.  We were there over three hours and not once did I feel pressured to leave, or not once did I feel as though I stayed too long.  The staff was the best.  I highly recommend My Wine Cellar. Love it!"}
{"text":"I arranged a surprise birthday party for my wife on Fri. 12/21 and Zoya and her team made it a wonderful and memorable event for our 15 guests and us. 

From the selection of a variety of wines and beers for tasting - to the \"munchies\" (sampling of flat breads, Artisan cheese & meat platters, and delicious chicken quesadillas) there was a great attention to service, and to making us feel welcome and cared for. 

A great experience!"}
{"text":"Favorite wine hangout in Ahwatukee.  Awesome vibe and super fun locals. Great chef offers amazing weekly specials, and will work with you if you need something special. Owners Chethan and ZuZu (sp?) are fun, unpretentious, and truly customer service oriented. Sommelier Kay-Tee has talent for finding moderately priced obscure wines with high point values and great flavor. She deserves a raise!  Highly recommend their monthly wine club."}
{"text":"If you like wine and awesome food - you MUST try My Wine Cellar. They have an awesome selection of vino, and an amazing menu. To boot, the staff and owners are wonderful people and make it a delight to come here. 

My food favorites on the menu are the pizzas, a culinary masterpiece! And my favorite wine is the ONEHOPE Chardonnay - not only is it inexpensive and delish - but 50% of profits are donated to Breast Cancer charities.

Bottom line, amazing and affordable food + yummy wine + great people = A good time! :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and have been here several times-- and they never disappoint! Last night we started with a few glasses of red wine and some happy hour bacon wrapped dates, which were perfection. For dinner, we shared a charcuterie board and finished it all off with panna cotta for dessert. The panna cotta was light and delicious, a perfect ending to our meal. Live music and ambience were great, and the friendly service topped it all off. Definitely our favorite wine bar!"}
{"text":"I've always thought MWC had a great visual atmosphere, the colors and the artwork were great,  but I never really connected to the place and their wine list was not interesting until now...

New owners took over November '11 and the vibe has changed for the better.  The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  Its the kind of place you can go to alone and make immediate friends with the other customers and the staff.  The wine list has greatly improved and since they brought in a new chef (Sarah) the food is absolutely mouth watering.  

They have a great happy hour on food and wine and their regular Saturday tastings are a great way to find new and different wines.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the wines they serve, which helps make a great wine bar.

Fantastic patio with live music on the weekends - this is the perfect spot for a group of friends or date night.

I'm starting to become a regular and I don't even live close by."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a couple friends.  When I was contacted about making reservations the lady calling was very nice, friendly and helpful.  Turns out that there really is no need for reservations on a Saturday evening at 5pm.  Place only had a couple people in it.

I do think it is nice that they have happy hour specials on a Saturday until 6.  Woo Hoo. 

I tried two glasses of white HH wine.  I did not care for the chardonnay at all.  I felt like I was drinking fruit juice.  Then I was going to try the one from Spain.  The waitress brought me a sample and I hated it - reminded me of baby powder for some odd reason.  So I tried a glass of the reisling.  I really liked it!!

For food we tried many things.  The french fries with no bacon.  They were delicious fries but I did not like the aoli.  I am just not a fan of mayonnaise based sauces.  The chick peas were my favorite appetizer that we tried.  It really grew on me and I didn't think I liked chick peas.  We also tried the bruschetta.  I had the one with brie, carmelized onions and apple.  It was okay.  I wouldn't order it again.  It was skimpy on the bri and the bread was a boring wheat flavor to me.  The onions were delicious though.  Also tried the brussell sprouts and wasn't impressed.  To al dente to me and I am not a fan of black pepper.  Also got  the house made pasta and it was really delicious.  I highly recommend it!

Live music started at 7pm but it was hard to hear from the side of the restaurant we were on."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been twice and Katie (bar manager) has been my server both times...she is great! She recommended the bacon/Squash flatbread and it was outstanding! The wine was great, and even greater on HH (which, btw their HH is from open to 6pm M-S. They are not open before 3pm though, so don't try going here for lunch...it's a chill, nighttime place to bring dates or close friends/family members.

On weekends, there is always an acoustic musician playing. I have experienced Blaine Long and Notes from Neptune. Both phenomenal. 

Long story short...if you read my reviews you know I like chill spots with great lighting and patios. This is another one of those....I will be back for a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc time.

:)"}
{"text":"Excellent wine list, great food and a friendly, knowledgeable staff. I love the newly renovated patio and the fact that the menu changes with the season. This place is finally what it should have been all these years!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere great view and comfortable seating in out and at,tje bar. Wine and food was great and they have happy hour pricing until 6!! Great find we will most cirtaintly be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on the patio with friends.  It was the 3rd of July and fireworks could be seen from the patio.  The place was packed. The holiday menu was very good and the burgers were especially tasty.  Would definitely come back again to have something from their regular menu."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. They have a huge selection of wine, and it's not stuffy at all. The food is delicious. It's an excellent place for an afternoon sip and a cheese/meat plate."}
{"text":"What a neat little gem this place proved to be.  

I literally have driven by this place a million times and never once stopped in until I was invited there for a happy hour one Friday.  Not sure really what to expect but it was a great call!  Although not the biggest place, it was spacious enough and not over crowded.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and very timely in her service.  The beer selection was very good and if you're a wino this is the establishment to check out.  

My Wine Cellar gets 2 thumbs up from me"}
{"text":"Very good place to be! 

Fine wine selection.
Quiet place and relaxing
Very good service and friendly people"}
{"text":"Great wine bar. The food is delicious, the staff is attentive and personable, and it's got a great vibe there. There's live music on the weekends when we go so the patio fills up pretty fast. This is quickly becoming one of our go to places. We love it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I've been a few times about... two? years ago (thereabouts) wasn't overly impressed, although I didn't DISLIKE it either.  Came back here a few months ago, and BAM, fell in love.  I'm definitely not a regular, but for the most part, the staff does remember me (which, hell anyone's gotta admit is nice) and I've brought several new people with me.  My understanding is that there's also a new chef? Not sure, but holyCOW the food is delicious now. Had some salmon patties a few weeks back, and cannot wait to go back for them again.  Need to try the Nutella desserts I was told about too. I will say I generally go during HH, because the prices are a littttlle too much otherwise."}
{"text":"First time in and had an amazing experience. Happened to be restaurant week and the three course meal was delicious. Service was great and fantastic live music on the patio. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time. The food was good. The fried chicken appetizer and the mussels were great, with a good balance of flavor and heat. I wasn't a huge fan of the Miso braised pork shoulder app, though. It wasn't bad, just ok. The musicians on the patio were surprisingly good...I was not expecting to enjoy the band so much, and neither was my husband. Good job! We enjoyed the golf course views at sunset, too."}
{"text":"SUCH a great little place! Nice decor, great service, AMAZING patio and view, 5 stars all the way.  Haven't had their food yet, but I will be back for sure and looking forward to trying the menu (sounds like they have a good variety). Wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time.  Looking forward to stopping in whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Just moved from San Diego and this had a hometown feel great food and gracious servers."}
{"text":"The first time we came here, we loved the place... Had just moved to Ahwatukee and were taken at how friendly and courteous the staff was. We've been anxious to go back since."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night. Had to hunt down a waitress for service even thought the place was almost empty for a Friday night. Food was OK not the best I would not return for the food. I would return if they had better live entertainment in the back patio for drinks."}
{"text":"I have been twice. Both times were great, the staff makes the place a charm to attend and go to.

~Fud/Drink~
Well, the food takes an obvious second place to the wines in house, which there are plenty of. The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed. 

~Atmosphere~ 
It has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event. 

~Extras/Rating~
They do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard. It is an awesome idea for a date, there isn't a better idea for a first date then some wine and pizza to chill to while you talk. They get 4 stars for having a good blend of food and wine/beer selection as well. Plus on top of that, the ambiance is perfectly romantic and will leave you with a great lasting memory! My fiance and I have a favorite wine bar, BUT this is a very close second!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! My hubbie and I popped in this past Saturday for a quick snack and drink. We sat at the bar and Deena helped us, she is #fabulous! We ordered the regular fries with house made Curry Ketchup, delicious! We also ordered a charcuterie board, which came with bread, house made pickled veggies, and we nailed picking out the best cheeses and meats (they have a great selection to choose from), BUT the best thing on the board was the house made jalapeño JAM!! I literally asked Deena for a jar to go!! And of course, their wine selection is great, I love trying new Chardonnays and they have a full selection. We will be coming back to try more snacks and listen to the live music on the weekends. Another great find!"}
{"text":"After enjoying happy hour a couple years ago, I finally had a chance to eat at My Wine Cellar a couple weeks ago and had a wonderful time!  We were greeted by the staff immediately, and were offered a seat on the patio as there was live music.  The musician was fantastic and added the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner.

Our waitress was Sharon, and she had good knowledge of the menu suggesting a great red wine for myself and a beer for my boyfriend.  We decided to order a cheese plate, and I have to admit this was the one thing we were disappointed by.  The cheese was good, however it was a small portion.  The prosciutto was a bit too sweet and neither of us chose to finish the portion we were served.

Onto the entrees...we decided to go with the flat breads and share so we could sample two.  The boy chose the classic, no mushroom.  It was very flavorful and generous on the toppings.  The second was absolutely delicious!  I went with the Bacon and Squash and was impressed by the richness of the toppings without being overpowering.  Definitely a must try!

Next time we will probably go with the bruschetta to start, as we saw a few being served and they looked tasty.  Our waitress suggested dessert, however the meal was filling and we did not save room.

Overall the experience was wonderful for a date night!  The live music was not overpowering, and there was even a large birthday party going on that did not take over our experience.   The restaurant itself was nice, very open and accommodating for happy hour, however the patio really hit home for us and I am glad we sat outside.  4.5 stars for food and drink, bumped up a notch for the live music.  

Definitely a must try if you like personal attention from the wait staff, good wine, and a beautiful patio to enjoy your meal on."}
{"text":"Went here with a girlfriend and we sat out on the terrace overlooking the golf course and The Awatukee foothills. It was a delight. 

We had a couple of different wines and shared a cheese tray. The wines were yummy and the cheese tray was fresh. 

The bartender was a gem and she was very knowledgeable about the wine selection.  Everything was very clean including the restrooms, which as we all know is a direct indicator as to what you could expect in the kitchen. 

My only comment was the odor of fresh construction in the building but when I inquired about that they said that the wine bar had been there for years and there was no recent construction."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my aunt. The wine was delicious and the service was pleasant and welcoming. We had the arugula salad and the Brie flatbread, it was delicious and decently sized portions. The place is romantic and stress free. If you want a good place to enjoy some wine and be worry free, my wine cellar is your place."}
{"text":"We live in Surprise. We went to that side if town to take care of some things and decided to go have a glass of wine. The options are great and have very good prices during happy hour. Nice spot!"}
{"text":"My Cheers bar.  Owners John and Shannon along with Ashley make this place my 1st choice. I even frequent ted the original location by the former Ruffinos.  
Here the patio on the golf course is perfect and has been updated, lovely.  
Of course the wines are plenty and staff knows how to pick something g you will like.  The food is great on par with a bit of everything.  I luv the chicken and Mac of the  day.  Oh and the lobster bisque makes my mouth water.  
Their wine club is a good way to try new wines and meet kindred spirits. Her special events are always gorgeous and exceed any expectations. Recently attended the Fall Harvest pairing, who knew, a pumpkin wine!  
Beer buffs are not left out.  A great selection and pumpkin porter, while it lasts.  
So, stroll on in and be sure to have plenty of time to savor every moment.  Also, music nights are eclectic, each musician will strike a positive chord with you.  Eat, drink and be merry."}
{"text":"Food and service is always on point whenever I visit. Think the best time to visit is the warmer months, so 90% of the time in AZ!! It has a fun patio with golf course views and a warm environment. I was unable to visit for a few months due to a car accident but every staff member who had met me before remembered me!!! That is saying something. They have a fun fantastic happy hour, wine flights perfect for tasting, and excellent food. It you want your normal silver oak or clos du bois don't come here. But if you want to try different intesting wine, then yes. MWC is the perfect place for you to chill and unwind."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE is AMAZING! ...We highly recommend it!  Sarah, the executive chef, makes everything so delicious. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel special. The ambiance is cozy & the view of the golf course in the back is relaxing,"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this place for Happy Hour.  We have driven past it a million times, but I always thought it was a wine shop.  Not much to look at from the outside, so it is easy to miss.

We had a wonderful time!  We each had 2 glasses of wine at Happy Hour prices, 2 glasses of a nice Merlot at $5 each, 1 Pinot Noir for $6 and another Pinot for $10.  All four glasses were generous pours, and we enjoyed them all.

The appetizers were fabulous!  We shared a baked goat cheese with tomato jam as well as the fried chicken.  Both were very generous portions, and the tastes were divine.

There is live music on Fri and Sat nights.  We're already planning to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the service is always exceptional . The staff is friendly and efficient - definitely recommended for a night out with friends or family to enjoy a glass of wine. Down side is the desert menu :/ which is very slim"}
{"text":"I LOVED this wine bar/restaurant. The ambiance was perfection, and the staff were amazing! It was so nice to meet the owner and to see her passion for wine and food. Not to mention, she's hysterical! Most importantly (let's be real, the best thing about anything is the food), my friends and I ate sooooooo much food and I can honestly say everything we ate was AMAZING! I highly recommend checking this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"My  Soroptimist club held a wine tasting at My Wine Cellar this week.  Members and guests were all wowed by the tasty food, delicious wines, excellent service, and lovely ambiance.  We sat out on the patio under the stars, and it couldn't have been nicer.  Although we weren't there for dinner we checked out the menu, and it looked ample enough to suit my vegetarian preferences as well as regular dining preferences.  The ambiance inside is lovely--tastefully decorated and quiet enough for an intimate dinner.  I understand that there is music on the weekends, and even a book club that meets there.  Wish I lived closer, as this would be a great neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"This place is by far my fav! I love love love the food and Deanna one of the waitresses takes the cake!  She is energetic and a ton of fun! I grew up in California and love wine, thus I had to try this place!  It was on par and honestly better than any wine bar I have had in Cali! And that's saying something bc I love wine.  Something that was also amazing is that they had folktale winery from Monterey and they did not even upcharge the bottle!  This shows a honest business as well!  Usually bottles are double what they are worth or even triple sometimes.  This place does it right! Their hazelnut chocolate cake is to die for!  (And I am not a hazelnut cake gal).  All in all amazing! If you want great food, amazing service, and  beautiful atmosphere come here!"}
{"text":"We use to love this place, but the food - value ratio is on the decline. We had the thin crust pizza and it tasted like crackers with red sauce. We enjoy the live music and warm tea on the patio at sunset, but it has changes so much. I am not sure if we will give it another try, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a joke if they think they compare to any sort of respectable wine bar. If this comment offends you, feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now. 

After looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab. I was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for Autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money, as they all had some special needs of their own. 

In an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.  

The Tomato/Basil/Mozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf?), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers? Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality. 

Thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening. If it weren't for the 2-man, live band playing a lively rendition of MyGirl in the corner, I don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty much want to guarantee a mediocre review from us? Make us wait 50 minutes for any food.
Or give us beets from a can.  2 pieces of bread for the cheese platter doesn't win you points either.
Friendly staff, a great miso pork dish, nice live music and reasonable wine price keeps this from 2 stars.
50 minutes?!?!  Almost left."}
{"text":"Shawizzz......zzzz.....zzzz

What my expectations of this cute little wine restaurant sounded. At first glance I was excited since Saturday nights are my nights to go Yelping! My Wine Cellar is the first stop. My guest and I sat at the bar.  We ordered a few drinks.... we ordered a few drinks....I said we ORDERED A FEW DRINKS!  Oh there you are! For a minute there I was getting thirsty. Granted big party was \"in da house\" out back rockin' away, but really I'm sitting at the bar. I can reach over to pour my own drink if that is fine.  

We ordered some roasted Brussel Sprouts, Classic Pizza, Fries, and Hummus.  Brussel Sprouts were good, Fries were greasy, Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it with.

Only thing I dig so far about this place is the ambience.  I love the outdoor patio overlooking the green grass and the band gave it a Jazzy feel.  I think they should invest in more couches, but that's just my opinion. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to frequent. I'm constantly bringing friends and family to this spot because I can always count on the for fantastic food and wonderful service all in an enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere.

There can't be more than 5 ladies on their waitstaff who are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about all the wines in house. Some nights they have live music on the back patio which is an added bonus to the great weather we have (almost) all year round.

If you stop in, make sure to try their meatballs... they are simply AMAZING!! Everything else is delicious too, but the meatballs are most definitely one of a kind and I love me some meatballs.

Shout out to Wine Cellar, you ladies are the best!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little wine bar with ambience, good food, and a decent selection of beer if you prefer.  What really makes this a nice place to go though is the staff!  We have been there a few times now and the great service and friendly people who work there really make you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"If a light dinner with a great glass of wine is what you're in the mood for, this is your place. Food was fantastic, especially the flatbreads. Nice selection of wine. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"First time here and it was outstanding. Great atmosphere and service. The food was delicious. We will come back and also visit there other location."}
{"text":"came here for the first time on my birthday.  Took the wine 101 class. its on a monday night at 6pm. It was sooo much fun and I learned so much.  The wine was all really great and it came with delicious little pairings for each different glass.  The women who taught the class was great. I feel back I can't remember her name but she was so cute and was super knowledgable.  The best part its very reasonably prices so I love that"}
{"text":"The wine list, views, and appetizers are great. I love the veggie platter and the chicken strips with Jalapeño jelly, it's a definitely not what you think when you order chicken strips. I love the goat cheese dip and bread too. It gets kinda pricey as for as appetizers go and sometimes the service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bruschetta is soo good!!!! Just wish happy hour was longer.  =)"}
{"text":"The quality of My Wine Cellar seems to have decreased over the past few years since it reached its peak around late 2005.  First, their hours diminished dramatically, so much that, if you aren't there for a happy hour or an early dinner, you're out of luck.  Closing at 9 PM on a Saturday just enticed me to skip over the place entirely and make an evening out of it somewhere else.  Then, although admittedly, their first priority is wine, they took Shiner Bock off of the tap selections.  Finally, their quality of food went from 'notable' to 'forgettable', so much so, that I stopped ordering their specialties and went strictly with pizza.  While their pizza is quite tasty, there is a cap on the amount of pizza-and-wine dinners one can have weekly, which was about the amount of time I put in there over the past few years.  That being said, you should support this place based on their discriminant selections of wine.  While its not a bad place to grab a glass of wine, you'd better get there early."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Wine Bar  with great food. Zoya, Katie, Shannon and all the staff are welcoming as well very knowledgeable about wine and beer.  The chef creates inventive delicious specials each week. 
My husband and I have been coming to MWC for years. Can't believe this is the first time I have posted a review. 
Great music  on the weekends too!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great vibe, decor and most importantly wine selection. Outdoor patio, friendly staff and craft beer too. Really cool and cozy place. Spent the entire evening there with friends and enjoyed the food too.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the babysitter for about another hour on a Saturday night about a month ago so we decided to have a glass of wine.  It has been about three years since our last visit.  Were were greeted quickly, given ice cold water and enjoyed a great glass of Pinot in a nice large glasses.  There was also live music that was not too loud.  The server (?owner) checked on us often and was very friendly but not intrusive.  There were mostly couples and the place had a good mellow vibe.  I cant wait to go back  and try their food menu."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a date night! Happy hour includes some yummy apps (my fave is the bruschetta) and discounted glasses of wine. There's space to sit at the bar, high top tables, as well as booths. I suggest going on the nights where there is live music to fully enjoy the experience. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about this wine bar. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Great staff, interesting food, and wine at an incredible value.  The best $5-7 pours you can find probably anywhere.  Take the wine classes if you can, fun and educational.  Where can you find that anymore?!?!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and some nosh with a friend.  I would give it five stars but I'm rather turned off by the inside seating area.  This place is best when you can sit outside in cool weather.  Especially around sunset =)

Occasionally they do have live music playing outside which adds to the ambiance of the dimly lit evenings.  A relaxing atmosphere that I think is a must to enjoy =)"}
{"text":"I think this place is a great little neighborhood wine/beer place. I do think the food is overpriced, for what it is, but it's not bad. Usually when we go there we get the pizza and it's thin crust which my husband and I aren't crazy about. Usually one pizza is only big enough for one hungry person or two not so hungry people. 
Mainly I like to go there get a few glasses of wine and hang with my husband. 
It's down the street from where we live and it's cool that a little place like this is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"has an awesome relaxed feeling when entering, seating on comfy couches and chairs, very clean-has lucille ball stuff all round fall tree and very cute decor- that did it- oh and the wine too!!!   bruschetta (traditional) is perfect w/ drink ..loved it"}
{"text":"Love the wine selection and live music on Friday's and Saturdays. Great atmosphere and outdoor patio/lounge vibe. Great wine bar but so far the food has just been okay."}
{"text":"They have some really cool beers...more than your typical selections. That's worth 5 stars alone. Food has been great and the patio has a chill vibe. Very awesome place"}
{"text":"From the ambiance, to the staff, to the wine list, this place has got it figured out.  I LOVE wine, but I usually feel like I'm being tested when I go into wine bars.  This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head!
They just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)
To top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!  
I think you get it by now: This place rules."}
{"text":"After a long day in the road...this place is an Oasis of awesome in the desert. Killer food, great bar, and perfect music. Shannon and Carissa were the just the best in every way possible. Could not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Big fan - perfect for Happy Hour or even dinner - love the hummus and the salads are great too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice happy hour spot and it has a good patio for the live music on Friday and Saturdays.  The food is pretty good as well.  After happy hour the atmosphere is kind of sleepy. For a wine bar there aren't too many selections by the glass (or even by the bottle).  I've been a few times but it never leaves me feeling like I need to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great wine selection!  One of my favorite places to relax on any night. Live music on Friday an Saturday!"}
{"text":"The staff here (Steph served us!) was fantastic! We ordered a couple of flights and then had a glass of our favorite - outstanding wine selection! I also couldn't get over how AWESOME the music selection was. Great food, great wine, great server (Steph!) - we will be back!"}
{"text":"What can i say - it was not great. It really was not. Yes they do have a lot wines, they a cellar after all. But we vent there for a dinner for a special occasion and i was disappointed. 

First impression was - Geeeee its sure is cold in here. Ok fine i'll get over it. We find a table and sit down. We order some wine - mind you there was no recommendation or comment on our choice. Whatever. Then we order some bruschetta based appetizers and gnocchi and soup. Bruschetta arrives and i am real disappointed that its just a bruschetta bread sliced real thick and not even toasted. How not cool. 
Then gnocchi arrives. It tasted ok but was cold in some parts and kinda skimpy on sauce. Is it possible it was nuked? By that time 2 man band started to play. They were pretty good and played some soft rock and country without overpowering whole place, like it often happens. But wait, why talk of the band if food review if not over, was not there soup involved? Hehe we wondered what happened to that as well. \"Oppps, you right\". Few minutes after our reminder it came. And not it was not worse the wait :( Too bland, too sweet. Not that great after all. 
We also got coffee and desert. Both were alright but nothing to write home about. Just ok.

Perhaps, if you come there with a few friends, do not care much about food and just drink the wine and listen to music it would be much better. We came there for a dinner and wine. Wine was good, dinner was not.

This place barely gets 3 stars from me. I am pretty sure i aint coming back either. Bleah.

\"I no like\"

{"text":"Update: Owner contacted me concerned about our recent experience with MWC. She handled the issue with grace and sincerity. She has invited us back and is confident we will have a good time- which I'm sure she's right."}
{"text":"You know my fellow yelpers have yet to let me down. I started with bacon wrapped dates and roasted organic veggies that are purchased from local farmers markets. I also enjoyed a nicely paired white wine with my dish. Gotta love that! Both appetizers were amazing. We had the red snapper with wheat barley and roasted veggies. The other dish was the Mac and cheese that was the chefs creation and apparently changes every day. Today he added large pieces of ham and bacon in a cheesy boat shaped dish of goodness. We finished off our meal with a dense chocolate ginger cake that had delicious chai mousse cream placed beautifully on the side of the plate. Everything we ate looked like edible pieces of art. The waitresses were very sweet and attentive to our needs. I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We went during Happy Hour. Ordered the bacon wrapped dates, baked goat cheese, & charcuterie. Everything was wonderful. All plated beautifully and so yummy!  Staff are friendly and helpful. They are knowledgeable about the dishes served and wines. This establishment is filled with regulars. All a good sign. If we lived near by we would be regulars too."}

The service, food, and drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night to hear the band.
Ordered a glass of fine wine and a burger with No Cheese,
The burger came with cheese and I sent it back.
The waitress apologized and asked me if I wanted another glass of wine and I said yes.
10 minutes later the waitress comes buy and asked me again if I want another glass of wine and I again said yes.
15 minutes later the waitress is cleaning off ever ones table,
With No wine, no burger, I called the waitress over and asked for my bill since I have not got served.
   This place can not handle big crowds and the waitresses never write anything down.
It is best not to eat there when a band is playing."}
{"text":"Went here for a lady's night out as our other plans fell through. So glad we did. Had an amazing server, the Mac and cheese literally made me want to just give up and accept a life of diabetes, live music and the patio seating allowed us to enjoy the sunset overlooking the golf course. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Ashley (the manager) was amazing. 

Food was excellent. 

Wine selection was good.

Service was outstanding.

I will be back!"}

{"text":"loving the 'new' owner and new chef at MWC. The food finally lives up to the wine selection, and i particularly like that they're offering a great craft beer menu. the new patio seating is fabulous on a cool Valley night. service a bit slow and stretched, but you're supposed to be relaxing anyway, right?  

flatbreads and bruschettas are really good...interesting combinations."}
{"text":"The vibe in here is great, fantastic to stop in for some wine and relax. Staff was very friendly. However, last night the odor was so bad (we guess from a sewer/grease trap) that we paid and left our $13 glass of wine unfinished. Hope it's fixed soon."}

{"text":"I found this place and its tucked away in a little strip mall.  It's intimate, personable, and has a \"cheers\" atmosphere to it.  They sell wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the prices vary from reasonable to expensive. They also have a small section for wine knick knacks, like wine stoppers, etc.  Selection is limited and small, prices are okay.  They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!!  yikes. 

I reccomend this place for a variety of reasons. First, the staff is awesome, and are totally educated.  Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer.  clean, nice etc.  Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.

The down side?  Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.  Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.

Plus, the owner lady is always there.  She has short hair and is rather loud.  She knows her stuff tho."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot for a nice dinner or to meet friends for wine and appetizers. On our last visit, we ordered the tempura cauliflower, bacon wrapped dates and miso braised pork shoulder.  Everything was very delicious. Our server was very friendly and was knowledgeable about the wine selections. They ran out of the wine that was on special, so our server brought a sample of another wine that she thought I might like. For dessert, we had the affogato, which is ice cream in a little cup of espresso. It was very tasty. We left feeling satisfied, but not stuffed. I would definitely recommend and we'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I was searching Yelp for bars with live music on a Friday night and My Wine Cellar came up with having a DJ who spins acid jazz.  It was date night, so I figured why not.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy, but not packed.  We were immediately greeted by all three members of the front-of-house staff. We were able to get a table against the wall in a booth-combo setup.

Katie, the bar manager, arrived promptly and said that we made it for happy hour and explained all the HH specials. The deals are good, especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price.  Anyway, she asked us what brought us in and I explained the Yelp search.  She then told us that the DJ wasn't playing but a new young guitar player was going to be doing acoustic blues.  We were totally down with that.

We ordered two beers and a bruschetta combo.  The bruschetta was very unique, on good artisan bread, and topped with well created toppings.  We ordered the Caprese with tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella; the Spanish, with mozzarella and thinly sliced chorizo with red peppers, and the brie and caramelized red onion.  It was a nice selection, and at only $11 was more than enough food to start our evening.  We took advantage of the happy hour food specials by ordering the tempura green beans with spicy aioli on the side.  The tempura was crisp, but left a little too much grease.  The flavor was really good and the aioli was a good accompaniment.   We were content.

As the end of happy hour approached, we decided to order two glasses of wine and were given direction by Katie, who is also My Wine Cellar's sommelier.  She did a great job of listening to our likes and matched two wines to our flavor profiles perfectly.  My wife had the Redwood Pinot Noir and I had the Crucillon Garnacha, a Spanish Zinfandel.

The music started and it was pleasant, although we were very close to the artist, so we decided to move to the bar.  It was also a little warm back in the corner and the bar was much cooler.  At the bar, we ordered two flatbreads, my wife opting to revisit the brie and caramelized red onion (she loved it), and me choosing the house specialty, The Territorial, a bbq-styled treat with short rib meat and provolone.  It was excellent.

Our evening at My Wine Cellar was thoroughly enjoyable, with each member of the staff conscientiously attending to every detail, engaging in pleasant conversation, and understanding how to take care of their customers.

We will surely return and look forward to sampling some other wonderful tapas and small plates, although I may not be able to get my wife to stray from her beloved brie and caramelized red onion now."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for date night. Super cute place. Nice selection of wine. The food was great -- the bacon wrapped dates were phenomenal. And, they had a lot of gluten-free options. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business meeting and I was very impressed with this cute wine spot. It was really cold inside so we migrated outside. 

Let's talk about the food and wine though. I got the zinfandel (red) with the baked goat cheese and another platter plate with prosciutto, salami, and the brie. The cheese one the goat cheese and brie was fantastic. It spreaded on the bread nicely. The prosciutto and salami tasted good with the goat cheese and complemented my wine nicely since the Zinfandel is a red wine that is fruity and leaves a dry finish. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this local wine bar! The newer owner Shannon is great! How she has revamped the tasty menu, improved the atmosphere including the charming patio along with better vino options, more of a music scene and improved service/staff has inspired me to join the wine club again as an excuse to visit my now fav Ahwatukee eatery.  Highly recommend this place for an overall amazing experience."}
{"text":"Great place to catch up with girlfriends and enjoy a bottle of your favorite wine. I went there last night and sat on the patio, the patio sits right on a golf course, but I wouldn't say the view is impressive. My friends and I shared a great bottle of reasonably priced Malbec ($30) as well as bruchetta. Their bruchetta comes in orders of 4, 6 or 8 and you can mix and match different types. We went for the olive one, sun-dried tomato and traditional. The bruchetta was great, but next time I would just order the traditional (tomato's, mozzarella and basil) and skip the other types."}
{"text":"Their bruschetta is good and the wine flows. Servers are nice but sometimes slow. I wouldn't recommend big dinner put here, but great for small groups. Kids are OK but will he bored."}
{"text":"I took my staff here for a happy hour retirement party for our boss.  

The service was prompt and attentive, the ambiance was nice, with soft lighting and non-intrusive music playing in the background, and the meat and cheese platters and bruschetta I ordered were all delicious.  

This was a hit with the staff and I can easily see coming back here for another event soon."}
{"text":"Date night, wanted to try a new place. Called to see if getting a table at 8 pm on Sat night would be a problem, she said no, come on down. We wanted to love it, as it's not far from home. It hurts me to give a place with a new owner a mediocre review. But I have to be honest.

Happy that we caught Notes from Neptune playing music which is only once a month; they were REALLY good. Relaxing yet upbeat, nice sax & voices, & not too loud to hold a conversation; well-done choice of entertainment.

The blonde server helped me choose a wine, let me try one I was considering, which I appreciated. 

My husband got beef sliders. They were tasty & toasted buns were a nice touch. They came with a few (a FEW) fries that seemed to be made from delicious, creamy potatoes, but were sadly soggy even though they looked pretty well-done. 

I ordered two apps instead of a meal - the sweet potato chips (server said they are delicious, made fresh to order) and the brussel sprouts. 

We did have a staggered order, as I took a while to decide on my food. Slider order went in first. But once I did order, I waited a LONG time for the chips, much longer than the turnaround for my husband's sliders. The menu says \"hand cut,\" so maybe they actually grab a raw potato and start carefully slicing when the order makes it into the kitchen?  However, I would then expect them to be uh-oh hot. When they arrived, they had NO heat at all. Given my history as a server & restaurant manager, I'm guessing then they were left in the window a while before making it to our table.

The sweet potato chips were a shockingly small portion for the $5 price - I had to hide my surprise when they were delivered. You gotta know, we are NOT \"big portion\" people, we often split an entree when we go out, as we are not fans of the \"more is better\" concept.  But for $5, this was ridiculous, a HANDFUL. My husband sincerely said to me, \"I planned to have a few, but I'd feel guilty, as you won't have enough.\" I should have counted, could have very easily and quickly, but didn't think about it before I dove in since I was hungry. They are thin-cut, come in a cutesy little mini-deep fryer basket lined very loosely with waxy paper that therefore holds them up higher than the bottom of the basket (like the gift basket trick of putting in a false bottom to lift up the gift items). Therefore, initially they look mounding out of the little basket, with a honey dip ramekin nestled in there with them (taking up yet more space NOT full of chips). Once I removed the ramekin and looked inside, I could no longer deny that yes in fact this was a - forgive me, owner - rip off. I know what a sweet potato costs, even an organic one bought at retail price at \"Whole Paycheck\" grocery store. I'm all for places making a nice profit, but honestly... I felt kinda \"taken\" by that app. If it had been delicious, maybe if it had \"wowed\" me (I LOVE sweet potato anything), but they were un-warm, not much flavor, and the honey aioli didn't improve them for me at all (I set that to the side after two tries). 

The brussel sprouts for some reason took another 15 - 20 minutes PAST the chips to arrive (no exaggeration, the band took their entire break & went back to playing while we waited for the brussels). But when they finally arrived, YUM! we agreed we should have skipped the chips AND the sliders, and just had multiple order of the brussels. (But that would be weird, \"Hi, just 2 orders of brussel sprouts, please,\" - not a reason to return). They were delivered hot, and their weight pushed that little piece of wax paper all the way down into the cutesy basket, no space-robbing ramekin, so I'm happy to say said basket was joyously full. We didn't mind paying $6 for those!  (Surely the brussel sprouts cost more than a small sweet potato?? Don't understand pricing logic here).

Music really saved the whole experience from being really mediocre. Server was very nice, but either she screwed up my order and 1. left my first item in the window and 2. forgot to put in my second item for a long time, OR this is normal kitchen flow (she didn't say anything like, \"sorry for the wait,\" so maybe this is normal?). Either way, unimpressed. 

SUMMARY: We agreed nothing to bring us back. However, we could see it's potential. If you hit it for happy hour prices and the music is good, and maybe when the patio is open, and the kitchen and servers are humming along, it could be a fine place to go, as others describe.  Moving on...........

P.S. - Funny, I just saw that \"Phyllis\" mentioned an odor the same night we were there. We were not sitting near either bathroom. I asked my husband at one point, \"Did you fart?\" He looked shocked, swore no (and he's pretty trustworthy on that Q.) A little while later I smelled a waft again... and I realized it was the same sewage smell that happens in public bathroom drains from time to time."}
{"text":"Light dinner before a concert consisted of some bruschetta, a side of fries and 4 glasses of wine. Live  music added a great vibe but realized a price jump from happy hour to regular prices. Still great, just catch that happy hour to get the best bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. This has been a definite favorite. Love their happy hour specials and incredible food. 

Stopped by for happy hour tonight. Again, it was wonderful until we received the bill. 

A TINY piece of chocolate cake cost $14. My salad was $12. We paid more for 2 desserts than we did for our entrees. There is no justification for this pricing."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST. Everything I've had on the menu is wonderful and unique. They have a great selection! For a wine bar, I don't expect such an extensive menu but I actually love getting dinner here with my wine. The entire staff is extremely fun and friendly. Atmosphere is on point. Will be back many more times!! This place is a gem- a must try if you haven't experienced it yet."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Will definitely go back. Great atmosphere, finger food and amazing set of wines!"}
{"text":"We  have been regulars at my Wine Cellar for a couple of years now.  The wine, service, and food are always amazing.  Shannon (the owner) likes to change up the menu with specials which allows for a new food experience, every time, without affecting the regular menu with all the favorites that you can count on being there week after week.  I like that I can try something new but also count on that my favorites will still be available. ( I still like to reminisce about the \"Thanksgiving Mac and Cheese\"  special they ran last November.  Seriously, it was that good.)

They have live music with some amazing artists on Friday and Saturday nights and wine club is so much fun too.  I love how welcoming the staff are and you truly feel like you belong there and are treated like royalty. 

And if you're looking for the best Al Fresco dining in the area, look no further. I can't wait for patio season!! 

If you're looking for your go to wine bar, give them a try.  I really love this place!"}
{"text":"I went here and I had a group of three people with me on the patio. The wine and board were fine but when we tried to pay with our Groupon I was stunned..I haven't seen this much racism against an Asian-American since World War II. The manager lady was incredibly rude to me. I would never go here ever"}
{"text":"I have been here once for HH and didn't get a chance to indulge in the food.  It's a cozy wine bar with some nice wine selections that gets busy and on the small side. It's a neighborhood wine bar so I really cannot compare to Postino's (in a different league). Only drawback service was really slow..almost 10 minutes for a server to take the order but I still would like to return for a glass of vino and maybe an app next time."}
{"text":"I have gone to \"My Wine Cellar\" a few times now and my opinion hasn't changed. It is the total package. A great wine selection and the food is amazing. And then you have the people. Shannon the owner, JD the chef, and all the rest of the folks. Throw in some fine eclectic live music and you have the perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite wine bars in the area. They have a really good selection of wines with fairy good prices, HH deals $2off on selected wines.  
The ambiance is enjoyable too, you can either have a group of friends hanging out together for HH, a casual date or even turn it into a romantic dinner; In this place you can set your own tone for the occasion.

The staff is friendly and tentative. The only recommendation to get the a 5 star rating is for the staff to highlight recommendations of the different wines and highlight any special selections/wine of the month along with possible pairings. However, if this is not a must for everyone, then a 5 star rating would be recommended, i personally appreciate the suggestions."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place for happy hour on a Wednesday night. Easily found, very quaint and laid back vibe. They have a reasonable selection of white and red wines, beers and other spirits. The waitress was nice and really attentive although on a Wednesday, there weren't a ton of people. We ordered the cellar fries and the board of meats and cheeses (I forgot the exact name), but they were amazing. That jalapeño jam is to die for and I've now expanded my palette to the cheese realm. Thanks!  They were opening a patio space expected to open sometime this week. I think that's a great addition especially with cooler weather. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with other Yelpers that this place is unpretentious, but it would only get two stars if I didn't admire its chutzpah for staying in business so many years and I honest to god, have no idea how. 

My friends and I come in here now and again for a post happy hour glass of wine and that's always a two-hour minimum visit. Not that we're trying to get out quickly, but there's a point where it gets absurd. Here's a little example. P and I came in one rainy night around 7:30. It wasn't too busy and we found some nice, comfy seats and waited for a waitress to bring us some menus. And waited. And waited. Don't forget, they're not busy. Twenty minutes later a friendly waitress comes by (they're always friendly, haven't had a knowledgeable one yet, but they're always friendly) with some menus. Another ten or fifteen minutes she comes back to take our order. P had a question about one of the wines so the waitress offered her a taste of it. How nice! Another ten minutes she brought me my glass and P's taste and mentioned that they opened a bottle just for her taste. Unfortunately, P didn't like the wine at all (if I remember right, it was on the list in the wrong place, and P was looking for something much, much different) so instead of waiting again she russion-rouletted it and just ordered something. It came, we chatted and enjoyed our evening and she catches my eye and nods at the next table. it seems they have ordered the wine P didn't like and the waitress stands at the table popping the cork out with great flourish saying, \"here's the bottle of wine you ordered\". Why no one questioned it not needed to be uncorked, I don't know. It's a classy place like that though (underlying sarcasm). My Wine Cellar I mean. Not the poor suckers next to us paying top dollar for an opened bottle of wine with a pour missing from it. 

I guess I feel a sort of affection for My Wine Cellar. The same sort of affection you would feel for your \"special\" cousin. The one that can't seem to move out of your aunt and uncle's house and never seems to make smart life decisions. Oh, I know we've all got one. You want to strangle him in one breathe but the next you can't because he's always got such a sweet grin on his face and small animals really seem to take to him. A lot. Anyway, My Wine Cellar is right here in Ahwatukee and they have survived and you can go and have a glass of wine and just hang out. Reasons like that keep bringing me back. Once I'm there I don't know why I came, but I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great place!  I love that they feature wines from \"the little guys.\"  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoyed our time here. I ordered the Wine Country flat bread and bacon wrapped dates, both were delish. Service was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was fancy and romantic yet casual at the same time. I'll definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I feel it's just about a three star event for Happy Hour. Rounded up for pleasant server, good $5 wine pour on HH, nice ambiance, & tasty buffalo bites. (But not sure they'd be worth the regular price of $8 as it's a small portion.  we paid $6.)  We also enjoyed the mixed olives. 

The turn-off was: yelp \"check in offer\" is \"free house snack.\" Sounds special.  It was popcorn. Unfortunately it not only was a tiny portion, (which, as soon as we tasted, was no problem!) but also, it was cold and soft-spongy-stale. Seems if you offer something, you'd make an effort for it not to be an afterthought and disappointment. 

We always try HH & then decide if we continue on w/ordering dinner & in this case, we passed. 

Great for a nice HH $5 glass (it's $5 & up) & view of lawn. I'm sure live music also adds to atmosphere."}
{"text":"I always like coming here.  The environment is always relaxing and the staff is amazing. They have the best meat and cheese boards as well! Price is decent and its a great place if you are looking to relax and hang out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Wine+ Happy Hour folks! =0

I've never heard of this place but I came here for happy hour with my co workers. Everything was reallyyyyy good and reasonably priced. We ordered so many mixtures of things. We got to build our own flatbread and also ordered Charcuterie. My bosses ordered everything which was amazingly delicious. 

The wine! I love Pinot Noir so every time I go to any wine bars I love trying them. I ordered the Apaltagua Reserva. It went down so smoothly. The good news is when you check in you get a free wine tasting! The second one I chose was the Rainstorm. This one was also tasty but has more of a kick to it since there's cinnamon in it. 

I really liked this place. Everything was delicious and the staff is beyond friendly. They REALLY know their wines! Not to mention they have so many other \"festivities there! They have a lot of events there, you can join a wine club, they have wine classes, and they even have live music there on Friday and Saturday! You can't go wrong with a great happy hour and great wine to go with it! =)"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening for happy hour and weren't disappointed. The place wasn't bustling with people, which was a big relief! We picked a corner booth and got seated. The menu looked quite amazing actually. I walked in here with absolutely no expectations of food but that quickly changed when I scanned through a rather comprehensive list of food items that they had to offer. We both picked a glass of wine each, which were $2 off because of happy hour. We decided to start with an order of French onion dumplings and truffle fries. The dumplings were perfectly done.. with crispy edges on the exterior and a beautifully cheesy filling. They serve it with au jus which we chose not to pour on over the dumplings. Instead, we opened them just enough to pour the jus directly inside them individually. Best. Decision. Ever. The flavors with spot on and the crunch from the dumpling wrapper was a really nice touch. 

The fries however fell really short. They were cut really thick and didn't get enough time in the fryer. They turned out soggy and limp.. quite easily one of the worst I've had. My disappointment kinda fell on the wayside because I was still savoring the wine and dumplings. We walked out feeling pretty good about this place. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"If you live in the SW Chandler, Ahwatukee or South Tempe area this is a great place to come for a glass of wine.  The food is superb, the cook formerly was employed at T Cooks at the Royal Palm, they have a nice happy hour and they have music on the weekends.  They also have a wine club that you can belong to and members get 2 bottles of wine monthly for a reasonably low cost.  We are also hosting a client event there in the next two weeks and the owner Zoya has been great to work with. We really enjoy the staff and all that MWC has to offer!"}
{"text":"There was live music outside, great food, good wine. I saw a board stating there was an event for wine & art; very popular now & fun :) Will go again. 
There's a bar, elegant lighting. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been to My Wine a number of times, but tonight I had something DElicious!  A little sharing plate called French Onion Dumplings.  It was the best food I've ever had there!  Rush on over before the menu changes;  they do that every so often.  I can only hope it is still available!"}
{"text":"My Wine Cellar is the retail half of Lucy's Place, which is the \"wine bar.\" Together, they offer you a bit of everything - from a plethora of wine to purchase and take home to a menu that sells by the glass. Pair their chardonnay or pinot noir with a bruschetta or caprese salad appetizer, and you'll find yourself in palette nirvana. 

The place boasts a cozy, off-the-beaten-path feel. You walk in and are immediately transported to a more relaxed, come-as-you-are, drink-as-much-as-you-want atmosphere that offers dining tables, comfy chairs and couches and a short bar. Inside the colors are true to wine bar standards - on the dark side, encouraging to just let your tense shoulders relax. Lucy's place is a delightful find - a hard throw away from the trendy places you'll find in strip malls or in popular Scottsdale locations. In fact, it's nowhere near Scottsdale, nor does it pretend to be anything except what it is - a wine bar that offers you a wide selection, impeccable service and an atmosphere you aren't quick to leave. 

When I went, they had live acoustic music - a one man show playing the likes of Ryan Adams and Wilco. It was the perfect addition to a satisfying happy hour experience. 

Plus, Lucy has a couple small TVs hanging in view, in case you need to catch the baseball scores (it so happened to be turned onto the Red Sox game). 

I didn't want to leave. That in and of itself tells me Lucy's Place is a rare find. I'd give it 5 stars if it were in my neighborhood. It's a short trek southward, but definitely worth a regular visit if you're in the area or just in the mood for wine that'll satiate your palette, along with a relaxed atmosphere that'll assuage your workday woes.

{"text":"This is a quaint little place! Minimum indoor seating but truthfully it is a wine store on the inside. The ambience for dining is outdoors as long as the weather permits! The heat lamps help some, but if its cold, not even the wine can take away the chill! But they have blankets! :)  I have not sampled their food menu but the wine choices I had were great! I sampled all reds I wish I could remember the one wine I tried that had a funny name. Oh well! I will go again and remember what it was from the menu and update this review! 

If you want some place different to go, then you will find this place well deserving of a visit! And make sure you you stop inside to look at the huge wine selection they have! It is very well organized! And you will find probably just about anything you are looking for in wine! If its not there, I'd be surprised!"}
{"text":"Bumping this place up to five stars since I have been here a couple more times and both times it was a great night.  This place has an awesome vibe to it, great food and wine, and good service.

The pizza is very tasty and filling. The bruschetta options are all amazing. I also tried the antipasto plate and was happy to see it came with a little salad that helped to balance out the saltiness of the meats. The cheese and olives that it came with were a great accompaniment to the wine we were drinking that night. 

This place is awesome because their bottle prices are extremely reasonable in price and they have some diverse options. The comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines.  I asked about a wine that I had once but haven't been able to find anywhere else and they actually ordered a case of it for me!  Just a really great place."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! Such a great atmosphere -patio if super quaint with lights and facing golf course. But the best part is the bacon wrapped dates --ur mouth will explode!! I dream about them"}
