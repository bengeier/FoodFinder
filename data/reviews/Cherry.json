{"text":"Sorry but the food was gross. There was a bug in my food which was no biggie... But the food was just awful. And the waitress kept joking about there being a bug in my food....."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Sushi was the best I have had in a long time in the upstate area.  It's the perfect spot to meet friends to catch up."}
{"text":"Excellent service ! The spicy mountain roll sounds way more delicious than it was but that wasn't their fault... Just wasn't what I expected. The salmon wasn't hot or cold just kind of there and blah... A type of roll I have never had before but I am pregnant so having the fish baked seemed like a great alternative, correct me if I am wrong but I believe it said shrimp tempera also and I never found the shrimp lol could be just a different style than I am used to ! The friendly staff made up for it ! We Are visiting from California so we had our two year old with us who was jet lagged and not too excited to be out to lunch but we were starving! The staff was quick and helpful with her, supplying ice & snacks right away for her to eat / amuse herself with"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful visit! The service was excellent. The food was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. The bar was beautiful and the dining room had low lighting and quiet soothing music. The serving sizes were large and the prices were very reasonable. The location is perfect for us as we live in Lake Wylie and would prefer to spend our money in SC. This restaurant is definitely getting 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times prior to tonight and each time the service has been excellent and the food has been great.  Tonight however they have done a complete 180.  We were sat at the hibachi grill and waited over 30 mins to place a drink order.  The chef finally showed up after an hour and started the show.  Extremely busy only 2 hibachi chefs not nearly enough wait staff.  Please fix it...  I love the food."}
{"text":"Friday nite @ 6:30 and that place is a GHOST TOWN. Got the Deluxe Sushi platter. Was very small, plain, and taste less. Had to send the \"miso\" soup back as it was just warm water and it was extra $. More waitstaff than customers--what a shame as it used to be GREAT & PACKED all the time..."}
{"text":"Used to be fantastic. The new management has lost there minds. Lousy service and they don't have their acts together at all. Nothing like having someone switch all the lights on full blast and start sweeping floors at 8:30pm while you've just gotten your food. Or not having enough help to handle business on a Thursday night.  Tonight they have several empty tables and are running a 30 minute wait. Lately a comedy of errors. Gordon they need you."}
{"text":"This is may favorite restaurant in Lake Wylie/Clover and such a step up from everything else around. The food is fantastic - sushi, hibachi, or order off the menu.  Deserts are excellent.  Presentation is beautiful.  Good drink selection as well."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month usually for sushi but I have done the hibachi as well. Hibachi is great for the kids! The sushi is good but not amazing. I would definitely recommend eating here for lunch instead of dinner because the portion sizes are the same except they are a lot less expensive! They have a pretty large menu. The service here is hit or miss which is really the only major down fall. They also close between lunch and dinner which is annoying if you want a late lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"Walk in about 5 and nobody in front. Saw a couple guy smoking outside and when they see me, one guy coming in with a black uniform and take the menu ask me how many. I was creep about him with a dirty uniform and the face not clean up really good. Look like just woke up in a slept. And all employee smoke outside not even clean their hand when they come back. Cigarette butt everywhere outside. I decided not to come back again."}
{"text":"What a great surprise.  Sushi was excellent.  Sat and ate at bar.  Service was superb, and everything we ordered was well-prepared and delicious.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Is beautiful place to have fun with friends. Delicious food. And nice people too. Love it. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Love going to Cherry!  Fun atmosphere and fun cooks!  Every time we have been we have had a great meal (Sushi or Hibachi).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent dinner..  Sushi..&..Bento Box... Nice feeling inside...friendly staff..a wonderful addition to our area!       Lois"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, waiter that serve us wasnt good, probably new, lady at the register jump in and save the day... Good job amy!!"}
{"text":"Second time trying take-out . Have thrown both away. First ordered extra spicy... Tasted like they just poured hot sauce over the food. This time I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein.. It smelled burnt when I opened it.  Yep! Nasty burnt taste! Even had some burnt noodles!! Noodles are soggy...pastie.  Last visit for me!"}
{"text":"Not long after they opened, I was thrilled to find a superior restaurant in Lake Wylie.  The wait staff was dressed smartly, were extremely vigilant and always polite.  The sushi was very good as were many of the other menu choices.  My wife and I became accustomed to expecting to wait for a table.    Last night, we found ourselves walking into a practically deserted restaurant.  I had never seen it like that.  We sat at a small table next to the window near the Habachi tables. Only two of the six had people seatd around them.  My first thought upon seeing the \"waiter\" assisting the table next to us was, 'really?'  He appeared to have slept in his one and only outfit of worn jeans, old t-shirt and worn canvas shoes.  He also had a very large folding knife tucked into his front pants pocket and clipped to the lip of the pocket. Slouching, as if disinterested in taking the other couples order, he stood back away from the table as if the elderly couple would ruin his cool.  I begged he not be our waiter.     Our's was not much different though he was polite, and sans pocket knife.  I ordered my usual overdose of sushi, while my wife ordered something stirfry-ish indicated to be spicy from the menu.  It was not spicy and it was overly sweet.  My sushi was good except I believe the yellowtail had sat too long and wassn't as fresh as I had become accustomed to.  The bottom line is we were disappointed with our food, unimpressed with the casualness of the waitstaff, wondered what had happened to a great little asain bistro in such a short period of time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice since they have opened.  I was hoping for a decent sushi place and they haven't disappointed as of yet!  The inside is nice and the outside has a wooden deck for when the the weather warms up.  Can't wait for the summer time date nights with my wife!  Both visits I have tried sushi and something besides sushi off the menu.  Everything so far has been super delicious!  If you travel through Lake Wylie much,  make sure you stop by.  Most places seem to stumble out the gate when opening but this place has hit the ground running!  I would definitely recommend the sushi and the Mama Mia roll to be exact!  I hope this place maintains!"}
{"text":"I had a very nice meal here Saturday. A very large menu to work through.  There are three live table areas for group meals.  Food flavors were spot on. Some meals include soup and salad but others do not. If arriving for lunch there are several specials.  They do not have WiFi."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere...extensive menu. LOVE the coconut shrimp!  Excellent, knowledgable staff.  Looking forward to dining on the deck when weather warms a bit. Sherry Lake Wylie"}
{"text":"Avoid. Came in 4pm on a Sunday, the place was empty, the hostess made us wait for 10+minutes to be seated while taking 2 calls with online orders. Then another 10 min for the waiter to show up. Asked for our 5-6 rolls to be served in a boat ( first time experience for kids), the waiter went and checked with the chef, who refused(!). Apparently you need to order 8 rolls to be eligible for a fancy plate in an empty restaurant.  Menus were sticky, place looked dirty, we decided to spend our $$$ elsewhere. Avoid, there are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Good sushi. We always order the tri color sushi dinner. Plenty of food and always fills me up. Comes with salad and soup. It has a tuna roll, and three pieces each of yellowtail, salmon and tuna. Nicely decorated plate. The shrimp in the picture were from my sons plate. He traded me those for a couple pieces of sushi."}
{"text":"I went to Shia Asian bistro in lake Wylie and they were closed for lunch...and due to the kids being hungry we went here. Worst mistake I have made in a long time. The sushi was not great...(Shia has great sushi I would highly recommend them for sushi) the service was horrible...waitress came once to check on us for the entire hour we were there. And there were only two other people in the place. So I don't understand what she was doing. But utterly poor...poor...service.   The place was great when they first opened, I have no clue what happened but this place is horrible. I would not recommend anyone to go there. Go to Shia Asian bistro..you won't be disappointed and their service is wonderful."}
{"text":"This best chinese food i had in years highly reccomend for anybody looking for a great meal"}
{"text":"Great Japanese and Asian cuisine. I have visited many times and was happy with food. Will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Came to the resturant, waited 25 mins for a waiter/ waitress, and the waitress saw us 3 times and ignore us. The customer services is very poor."}
{"text":"The best food , the best service and a great time . We love it here so much we dine at least once a week !"}
{"text":"They offer 30% off sushi rolls on Mondays, thought I would try them again.  Rolls were good, much fresher, but rolled so loose you had to eat with a fork.  Glad they are getting better and nice to have a discount day.  Warning they close after 2:30 to reopen later for dinner."}
{"text":"Today I tried the coconut chicken from the grill as something different. The lunch portion comes with a starter and soup and I had a house salad with shrimp sauce. For $7 is was a LOT of food. The coconut chicken was four strips of battered chicken with coconut in the crust served with a creamy sauce that I can only compare to honey mustard sauce. The chicken was well cooked and crispy, but other than the mild coconut flavor from the actual coconut,  it was lacking in the coconut flavor. While the dish was good, I don't think I'd get it again because there are too many other things I like better at Cherry."}
{"text":"Wow! Best sushi we have had in the Carolinas since moving here from California! And decent prices too! We had the Spicy Tuna Roll, the Yellowtail Jalapeño Roll and the Pink Dragon Roll. Yum! Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. It has a great outdoor seating area and the inside is very pretty and comfortable.  We were seated at the hibachi table as we requested. The service started horrible and didn't get better. It took 20 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order and that was after we flagged her down. She took our food order and we never saw her again for the course of our meal. Again we had to flag her down and she acted as if we were all being ridiculous wanting a refill on our drinks after 45 minutes. Absolutely Rude! Our chef, while he was entertaining and did a great job at cooking the food he too had many moments that were rude and uncalled for. From whipping broccoli at both my kids faces to over pouring sauces over people's plates and throwing egg shells, getting raw egg in the sauces and on clean plates. It was almost like he was trying to ruin our experience.  The hibachi and sushi overall was good but felt the veggie hibachi was well overpriced. We will probably give it another try and hope the service and chef are more respectful."}
{"text":"So sad how bad this has gotten.  Service is beyond slow and food is not even subpar. We used to come all of the time but now will go elsewhere. Food was not tasty at all...steak was chewy and gross.  Veggies tasted like they were old.  It's not the same."}
{"text":"This place must be under new management and/or ownership as it used to be a great restaurant. Now it has horrible and slow service. On a busy Friday night this weekend, the overweight female manager chose to only visit one table (obviously her friends) and eat off of their plate rather than walking around to ask patrons how their dinner was going. We sat down and had no server for 20 minutes. When she finally took our order, she brought hot soup before even delivering drinks. What place does that? Then it continued to go downhill from there. We won't be back and from speaking to others, they share the same experience."}
{"text":"Right down the street from us and we only just discovered it!!  This place is amazing and has wonderful service!  Try the tuna tartar, clear soup, octopus and seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for Asian cuisine! I live 2 hours north of here, but visit frequently. The food is always consistently great!!"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers since Cherry opened. We went almost every single week for a long time. Went for Valentine's Day 2014, it was horrible experience. We waited 30+ minutes for drinks and the food took over an hour and half to arrive. When we complained to the manager, she did not act concerned or due much other than give us a quick sorry.   Fast forward, new management and a pregnancy (couldn't eat sushi so we stayed away for awhile). We take our 5 month old baby in to the restaurant for dinner tonight. When we walked in, we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. No big deal. A family of 4 walks in right after us and they are sat immediately. A few minutes later, a couple walks in and they are sat immediately. When we inquired why this couple was at ahead of us, we were told that they couldn't accomodate our baby at a table, they needed an open bench. The couple seated ahead us were sat at a half bench, half chair seat. The hostess was extremely rude and acted like we were an inconvenience for her.   We will not be back ever again. I've hears that Shia Asian Bistro is good so we'll give that a try."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!  You can choose from bar, standard booth/table, patio, or hibachi grill seating.  We got the money pouch and Philadelphia roll for apps.  The money pouch items were a little over fried, but still pretty good.  The sushi tasted very fresh!  My boyfriend got the hibachi chicken and really enjoyed it.  I got some of the best sesame chicken I've ever had!  The only real complaint is that the veggies needed to be cooked a little more.  Overall, Cherry is definitely a place I'd love to come back to :)"}
{"text":"Great hibachi and Sushi. Fast and clean too.  I have been there many times now and it has been fantastic every time!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! Joey was a great server. The French dragon roll is off the charts.  The coconut shrimp is also great!"}
{"text":"Great staff.  Bryton is magnificent!  Nice sushi bar.  Fresh!!!!!  Nice atmosphere.  Family friendly."}
{"text":"Went here spur of the moment and have to say I loved the food.  I'm not sure why all the negative response.  I got the Salmon Bento box which I shared with my son and he loved the California rolls and the rice and I ate the Salmon.  They did forget to bring the salad but I wasn't that hungry anyhow so didn't realize until later.  Anyhow, had the Sake and that was awesome too.  Good size portion and the waiter (Brighton) was such a beautiful sweet awesome soul!!!  Will go back here just to chat with him because he had an awesome sense of humor... was great with my little one and put the tv on for him and just all around awesome service and conversation!  Thanks Brighton and Cherry for brightening our otherwise dull day!  And the food and atmosphere wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Excellent experience at Cherry tonight for a date night. Exceptional sushi and service. Highly recommend. Seated right away and we had a fantastic server. Got the CA rolls, lo mein noodles, and spider machi rolls. Also got Lycheetini and it was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and had the lunch bento box as recommended by others.  Great value for money - I had the shrimp tempura box, which also came with salad and soup.  And it was good!"}
{"text":"We go there for a hibachi show. The kids love the entertainment and they have good portion sizes. I have ordered beef and broccoli, my go-to, and it was great! They have hibachi for lunch in case you want to go for the experience with a lower price tag.  Call ahead for groups, its worth it."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for a long time and while it is not the best Japanese steakhouse we've ever been to, it is one of the better ones in the Charlotte Metro area. Today, my wife and I go in to have lunch together. We were told we could not sit at the Hibachi because they \"were not trying to use them today due to humidity\". We observed another group sitting at the Hibachi and they stated they let them sit there because they already had reservations. We then sat at a regular table and proceed to order hibachi. The food comes out luke warm, my steak is overcooked, and the rice was horrible as if it were from a large pre-made batch from earlier that morning. I proceed to tell them my steak is not rare, but they insist it is. I have been eating steak my whole life and can assure you that it was medium well to well done (no pink in the center whatsoever). I have never been more disappointed in the food or service at a place, especially as a long standing patron. We will NOT be going back to this place after this experience."}
{"text":"Great hibachi!! Eaten here multiple times & it never disappoints! My son has a seafood & shellfish allergy & they are always happy to cook his food separately with no issues. I have yet to try the sushi because we are stuck on the hibachi!!  By the way, the have the best sauce that they serve with their hibachi!!! Pour it on EVERYTHING!!! It's the bomb, trust me!  **UPDATE... I have been back here several times & have to say that I am highly disappointed. The service has gone way down. Very long wait times & lots of miscommunication between the server & chef. The chef did not want to be be there & the effort on his behalf to entertain us was not there. Also the food wasn't seasoned at all. They were clearly short on help & combined with poor food & service, we will def not be coming back any time soon. Huge bummer."}
{"text":"Best Asian / Sushi we have had in the area. The nigiri is sliced thick and is fresh and delicious. The portions are large and everything we've ordered has been great. We have ordered carry out and have dined in. The dine-in service was fantastic. Our server brought the kids entrees first, kept on top of refills and even brought our kids balloon animals! I was impressed."}
{"text":"Cherry was an awesome value for lunch, full hibachi experience on a lunch budget. Good food, fun staff, great times!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!!   Good sushi and good service.   Have been there several times. The place always is clean has great food always friendly and happy people working there.  We will definitely be going back because I really want to try and do the hibachi grill next time.  We are always happy about the presentation of the food and quality."}
{"text":"Food; decent drinks; decent, dude blasting my mouth with olive oil instead of alcohol on accident, attempting to over compensate with alcohol and blasting my cousin In the eye with liquor and no one addressing any of it....umm I will find some where else to dine and suggest you do the same. Wow."}
{"text":"The best by far place to go in Lake Wylie. Their food is better than any Japanese Steakhouse in a 40 mile radius. Little hole in the wall but come on those are the best! Hostess could use a little help but the service is always nice. If you want somewhere without a long wait try Cherry's."}
{"text":"Okay, I like really good sushi, and I appreciate authentic Japanese food and atmosphere, but I can also appreciate decent, tasty sushi - as long as it's served by friendly folks in a fun atmosphere.  Cherry isn't very authentic or shi shi, but the owners have done a great job with decor and the staff is super-friendly.  This is one of those Asian-mix kind of American-ized joints with \"Japanese steakhouse\" options on one side and regular seating on the other.  It's bigger than you think inside, close to the water, and sports a really friendly casual outdoor deck I will enjoy next time I go.  Yep, I'm gonna return here!  We sat at the bar and received great service from two women who were fun to talk to and enthusiastic about the place.  Cherry has a full bar (yes, with a blender), several sake options, and several Asian beers as well, including Kirin on tap (nice!), Sapporo and Asahi.  The place definitely does not look thrown together, and they were well-staffed the night we went.  Our servers stumbled on pronunciation of a few menu items and admitted to not yet trying some menu offerings, but we didn't care.  If you're a snob about your Asian food, this place might not work for you.  Relax!  It's Lake Wylie, after all! :)   We enjoyed agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, nigiri fatty tuna, eel rolls, and another combo roll.  Everything was tasty and fresh and decently prepared.  My husband was impressed at the temperature of the tuna, which was not icebox cold, like you get in many places.  They have an efficient sushi prep team.  The style of sushi is a bit smaller than some places I've seen, but not skimpy.  Prices are in line with other restaurants in the area.  This area is not overwhelming with great restaurant options, but hopefully Cherry is starting a new trend."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area so came here with low expectations because typically a place that serves sushi, hibachi, and several cuisines doesn't do it well.  we are pretty picky about sushi quality but gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  REALLY good sushi, the mei fun noodles were REALLY good as well, and we tried the hy and sour soup- it was good but not trhe best.  overall great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"For a small Asian restaurant this is definitely a winner! I got the pad thai and it was delicious. I like the fact that they asked what heat level I preferred, as some people prefer a mild pad thai.  My parents got the sushi here and they absolutely love it. One of the best sushi locations in Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty cute, service is fast and the food is actually really yummy. Love the huge menu and options they have here.  The view from the balcony is really nice, especially on a cool summer or fall evening over looking the lake. The sushi is really fresh and tasteful.  The waitress that served us was a little rushy and it was fairly slow at lunch time when we came, other than that, you guys gotta try this place out"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll go back.  Went on a Monday for lunch. I used to enjoy this place but it's definitely going down.  The chicken teriyaki was dry dry dry.  The sushi was warm.  The salad was watery.  The soup had no flavor.  What was worse than the food was the filth.  The outside is still nasty.  Cigarette butts everywhere.  The sidewalk coming in is black and gum on it. Was seated by window next to hibachi grills and the view is nasty.  Trash and cigarette butts everywhere in parking lot.  Filth,  food and handprints all over the glass.  No one there cares.  My boyfriend was grossed out by the bathroom and said it looks like someone peed all over the floor and it hasn't been cleaned in over a week.  We've been together for 5 years and been to hundreds of restaurants.  This was the first time he ever commented on a bathroom.  It appears as though this place figures they got it off the ground and people are coming so screw the rest.  No cleaning.  No attention to detail anymore.  Dry sad food.  Warm sushi.  No excuse.  Lunch sucked.  The only reason I put 2 stars was because the service was good."}
{"text":"Service was great .. Sushi mediocre but I am a bit of a sushi snob. I prefer Fuji and Red Ginger. The \"Latin kiss roll\" was very good. I just found most of the specialty rolls to be tempura fried or have crab stick so it was a little lower grade than I prefer. Nice place, very clean . Just not my number 1 choice."}
{"text":"I get sushi from here 2-3 times during the week and it's always been great. Very fairly priced. Great atmosphere in the bar area with a few nice TV's as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here earlier today and sat outside on their deck, at a table with an umbrella and a beautiful view of the lake. Got the Lunch Bento Box and it was fabulous! So much food for a great price! Everything you see in the picture plus a side salad and a cup of soup for just $8.50. And they even fixed my sushi to accommodate for my allergies! Great place with friendly service; I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD ... I can go as a single women and sit at the bar and have the MOST AWESOME BARTENDER AND PERSON I have ever met wait on me with the BEST drinks.   Food is awesome..... I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent!  We have eaten here 3 times since it opened earlier this month!  The chefs special rolls are incredible, miso soup is great, every thing has been really good.   The only issues is service, while very polite, and eager to serve, the product training is lacking, twice our server didn't have a good understanding of the menu or Asian dishes.  Because of this I would normally give 4 stars or less, but the quality of the food was such a pleasant surprise, and so superior to anything else in the area - 5 stars.  Plus I think the training will get worked out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun hibachi experience this is a good little place to check out. There is a bar on one side with tables on the other. The food is good, and the staff are friendly.  The back of the room has an awesome full-wall art piece that I think really pulls together the experience.  I gave three stars because the food and the hibachi don't shine as they should. It's pretty standard and basic.   Also a questionable experience--friend was sick after hibachi with me one night where she had the shrimp and said it tasted weird. Bad shrimp or not cooked enough? Not sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sushi. Reasonable prices. The hibachi is good too. Can't miss. In a dumpy strip mall. Try to overlook that you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I had lunch here today for the first time. The interior is beautiful with two sections. One section is the bar area with some booths and the other section is near the hibachi with some tables/booth seating. There is also a deck for additional seating but it was too cold for that. We sat in the hibachi area with the large windows looking out on to the lake area. The menu is extensive with lots of choices for everyone. My husband tried the orange chicken with white rice while I had the chicken teriyaki bento with fried rice. The miso soup my husband had with his meal was a little bland but there was lots of tofu and seaweed. My meal came with both a clear soup and a salad with ginger dressing. Both were excellent! My husband enjoyed his orange chicken and said it was tasty with a little kick. My teriyaki chicken was delicious. My bento also came with fruit (grapes), gyoza (fried), California roll and fried rice. The food was delicious and plentiful as I shared some chicken and fried rice with my son. The attention from our server was excellent and our glasses were always filled. They also brought out a plate for our son and gave him some training chopsticks. We are looking forward to our next visit here!"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. Food was excellent, service very good as well. We didn't try the hibachi grill, but we will. They had $4 long island iced teas, which were very good. The sushi was very good and decently sized."}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant! I recommend Cherry to all my neighbors. Great dine-in experience or carry-out! Sushi is always fresh, service is always warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"I would say this is the best if not the only place for hibachi on the lake.......but they are waaaay too expensive for what they offer."}
{"text":"Great sushi! The Bento Box is a bargain and is quite good. They are Limited on their wine selection."}
{"text":"We ate here last week - hopeful but not expecting top notch.   I have to say, the sushi was very good (we did not have hibachi but the chef did look to be doing a great job).  The decor was nice - I'd loose the drop red balls in the bar area (I am a designer, I know asian restuarants do a lot of kitsch but that cheapened the look) but overall very nice.  Our waitress was sweet, she seemed a little nervous/shy but she did a good job.  The only thing - they were out of a Sapporo and it was early on a Friday.  Seriously?  A Japanese restaurant shouldn't run out of Sapporo :).  Wonton soup was excellent as was our sushi.  Loved the salmon/avocado rolls."}
{"text":"Went with family last weekend and was pleasantly surprised!  Quick service and friendly/accomodating staff. Great food presentation!  Will def. Go back soon."}
{"text":"Above average sushi and decent menu selection beyond sushi and hibachi.   They were pretty busy when we showed up and the service wasn't perfect. It took the bartender noticing our drinks hadn't been brought over to get them. This was after watching the drinks sit there for a good 10 minutes. The hostess and a few other employees seemed overwhelmed from the amount of people there.   The lychee martini was okay but the Long Island ice tea was disgusting. Recommend sticking with beer or wine.   Definitely planning on going back though to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Just had some food from here recently. It's not too bad but they do have too much MSG in their food. I had the orange chicken and it was delicious but afterwards it didn't agree with my stomach. I'll give this place another chance to make up for this first impression."}
{"text":"While I understand it's Saturday night, when ordering sushi to go and you're quoted 15 minutes, plan to wait an hour prior to even traveling to the restaurant. Then plan to wait and wait and wait more. Then when you ask what's going on, you're given \"the hostess answered the phone and she didn't know\".  Update to add: the sushi was delish, and they gave us a gift card."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of sushi! Dragon roll & sweet potato roll were phenomenal. Service was quick & attentive. Even the clear broth soup was good. Will definitely be back. Monday night special: it's 30% off sushi night."}
{"text":"We were taken to a wobbly table, with greasy walls. The waiter had dirty finger nails and told us nothing about menu, specials or made any recommendations. We ordered 3 sushi rolls and a lettuce wrap with shrimp. No shrimp in wrap it all and mushing bland. The sushi made us sick and felt bad the rest of the day. Harris Teeter has better  sushi. We won't be back. It's a shame since it has a view of the lake but very poorly done. The hostesses talked loudly the whole time, poorly ran restaurant. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Not bad, we came on a Friday night and they were pretty busy. We were seated on the patio and had to wait for about 10 minutes to be greeted (I think they forgot we were out there). The sushi was pretty good for the price, definitely not the best I've had. Looks like a fun spot for hibachi though so we will be back to try that next time!"}
{"text":"Rainbow roll was delicious. Hibachi filet and shrimp was awesome. Soup was super tasty. Waiter was great. Attentive but not annoying. Eat here. Now.   It's saying my review is too short but what else can I say. Delicious food. Period."}
{"text":"Very good hibachi place. Gotta get the right chef though. They have a couple of good ones and a couple of so so ones. You don't have to order hibachi or sit at the hibachi seats.   Decent beer list but not fantastic.   Most of our crowd got hibachi. They enjoyed. I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken to mix it up a little bit. It was below average. The flavor tasted \"fake\" and the chicken pieces were quite big - I mean you had to use a knife to eat. Who uses a knife to eat pad Thai?  Stick with the hibachi."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, consistently good sushi, fried rice and always drink specials. They also have lunch specials and hibachi grills. Conveniently located near the lake and a nice atmosphere for a casual dinner, without the load, crazies from T Bones!   If you're in the mood for some good sushi at a fair price, with good service and you are in the Lake Wiley this is your place.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow. I've never had worse service in my entire life.  Went on a busy Friday night-we arrived before the restaurant filled and there was a wait. I had a bad feeling the first time our server came to the table. She looked as though she had not bathed, brushed her hair or washed her clothes, and unfortunately, her service was no better. The food wasn't bad, though my husband was very disappointed by his $21 chicken and shrimp hibachi combo. It was extremely small and really didn't resemble the portion sizes diners who sat at the hibachi bar received. Sushi was good and quick to arrive (funny, another server was the one to bring us the sushi!). The owner, or perhaps manager, walked by our table and asked if everyone was good I said no, it wasn't and he just kept walking. He didn't care what we said, I've simply went through the motions of pretending to care.   Needless to say we will not return."}
{"text":"Girls night gone \"Yawn\".. My gosh.. Third time and still nothing exceptional.. Gone from okay to worse. The girls love the sushi.. No seafood for me.. I ordered wings.. I asked about the sesame flavor of wing. The waitress said I'll bring you some to try. That was nice of her.. What she didn't tell me when she brought an oversized bowl of the stuff that it was 100 degrees.. No idea until the fork that I dipped in the sauce hit my tongue..wings came out later just fried with sauce on the side.. The chick used to work at a wing place.. You would think she would have told me when I placed the order that they aren't tossed..  I could still carry on about the poor service.. We where there from 6 to 8:26.. It took 20 minutes for them to figure out how to split a bottle of wine.. we are just sitting there with a dirty table and no drinks..not very good team work from other co workers there.. Literally ready to just walk out of the door.. Will not waste another night here.. Usually when your spending $30 a head you leave giggly, happy and satisfied.. 3rd strike of just barely okay.. Your Out.."}
{"text":"Service is excellent kitchen is slow. Martini sucks. Salad excellent. Kitchen screwed my dinner up while my friends ate all I had was rice. Waiter was excellent but if the kitchen doesn't put the food out correctly they can't do anything."}
{"text":"We live within a Few miles of here and got take out several times before eating at the restaurant.  The food is great.  We have loved it every time.  BUT the service is awful.  Drinks always take forever.   Last night we made a reservation for 8.  2 people got food 20 mins after everyone else.  My husband ordered a meal and a sushi roll and never got the sushi.  Bar doesn't have any flavored vodka and when our drinks were taking 10+ mins to get to the table and we asked the bartender/manager got an attitude with us.   This is our 3rd time eating in and every time the food is great and the service is horrible.  Seems a lack of good leadership is going to hurt this place in the long run.   I doubt we will return again."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The hibachi chief kept skipping me. He gave out all of the rice and put a spoon full on my plate. He gave out all the vegetables and didn't give me any at all. When I asked why he wasn't giving me food he laughed then filled my plate with onions and mushrooms.  When I said I don't care  mushrooms, he said I should've told my server.  They only had 1 waitress working and there were two large parties. Both had reservations so, it wasn't a surprise for them. They needed more people working, It took over an hour to get our billed paid."}
{"text":"My go to place in this general area is Fuji, Rivergate. However, we've been meaning to try Cherry for a while, and finally took the plunge.  I like the vibe of the place. It has a couple of different areas, and we happened to get sit on the side by the bar. I liked that side, as it was smaller, and seemed less crowded that the larger dining area. They had seats at the bar, two high top tables I think, and several booths on this side.   My daughter and I ordered Hibachi style steak, and it was delicious. My wife and other daughter ordered Sushi. They thought it was very good. I thought they had a wide selection of both. You can also order your typical Chinese dishes here, General Tso chicken, and other Chinese style dishes.  They have a large selection of specialty drinks also.  The staff was friendly, and although they were pretty busy, we did get a table with only about a 10 minute wait. Overall, a solid option in the Lake Wylie area."}
{"text":"So I went back to cherry after an extremely long break. I will never pick up food from here again so decided to try sitting inside.my food was very warm like it had been sitting under heat lamps. I ordered a salmon and tuna roll no reason why they should be that warm. I tried to express my concern with the waiter but he seemed very busy flipping his hair so even after a second try I highly recommend you don't eat here honestly I have no idea how this place is still opened it's really horrible. I've eaten better food and have received better customer service at a Panda Express!"}
