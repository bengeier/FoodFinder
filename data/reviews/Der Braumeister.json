{"text":"Love this place. Having predominantly German roots, I can appreciate the ambiance of an ethnic dive like this. Great German food at a great price. Plenty to choose from. Love the Jagerschnitzel. Black Forest cake & German Chocolate too when they have it available. A full bar on tap for all your needs as well. All in all a great European dining experience without having to book a flight on Lufthansa to the Old Country."}
{"text":"Roll out the barrel, I love this place.  Mine may be a biased opinion.  I am German and I love German food- sauerkraut, wiener schnitzel, potato salad, I'll take it all.  The bar was voted top 20 bars in America in Men's Health magazine last year and they do have a great selection of brews.  The menu is pretty simple, all the staples are represented.  They have a super tasty potato pancake Rueben.  My boyfriend really enjoys the sauerbraten.  Their German potato salad is warm and hearty.  They have sauerkraut balls that I could eat 50 of.  The only complaint I have with the place is the service is a little slow(very nice!-but slow) and the booths are kind of cramped.  The bench seats are reminiscent of church pews and anyone with an ass will probably be uncomfortable.  Other than that, one feels as though they are eating at their grandmother's house.  It's a great place to have a huge, homey meal, drink some delicious Belgian or German beer, and take some time to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've paid for in a long time. If you're in the Parma area go to das schnitzel house or on the east side go to sterles. The food was horrible here. Super salty little to no breading on the schnitzel and the veggies were cold. Had to listen to the owners grand daughter talk about how groupon users are cheapskates and can ruin the night(we did not use groupon but others in the restaurant did) our server was good. We had Brittany who was very pleasant.  Let me add that it was one of the smallest portions of schnitzel I've ever had. I have had twice this amount on sandwiches from most other places."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in our neighborhood and we love it! Wonderful true German beer selection, very clean, fantastic food and excellent service that's warm and friendly. DId I mention the food? It's truly a diamond in the rough and the prices are spot on. This is a true German beer house and you'll feel as though you've been on a retreat to another place. Total Cleveland because it's part of our diverse history."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time last night.  I had breast of duck and one of their draft beers.  Husband had sauerbraten.  We are connoisseurs of German cuisine, and this place is really good.  Cucumber salad was wonderful.  Bread seemed a little stale.  Entrees were tasty, satisfying, authentically German.  Dessert was great.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Walking in from outside: bar looks like a dive.  Needs a little refurbishment.  Three stars because it's not the Bavarian Inn in Shepherdstown MD, the ne plus ultra of German restaurants with a Michelin rating and a dining room that stuns you.  We will definitely go back to try more beer and other entrees.  We live 30 miles away but it's not hard to find.  Neighborhood looks a little dicey, so go early."}
{"text":"Great authentic German food. I stopped in the other night and had the German platter. Excellent sausages, quality local sauerkraut, and service with a smile. I always bring out of town visitors to try this hidden gem in west park, and love the new seasonal special. Can't wait for the new august menu!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves back in this neck of the woods for holiday 2011, so we decided to take another stab at eating and drinking at Der Brau.  I was happy to note that the restaurant now has a Facebook page that seems to be getting updated regularly and that they had posted and spread the word about their holiday hours, making it much easier to catch them when they were open.  

Beer is a main attraction here.  (They have a wine list too but we didn't look at it because we wanted beer.)  We ended up with some excellent Hofbrau beer and had no complaints with that, but the selections they had on tap seemed to be limited, especially since several seasonals were already sold out with nothing replacing them.  I guess this is a place where you really have to watch their announcements and time your visit to make sure you have the best beer selection.  

The menu appetizers and entrees include many authentic German selections.  We had the Wiener and Jager schnitzels, along with some excellent Hofbrau beer.  Very few restaurants can do a decent schnitzel; most of the ones I've had taste like they were frozen and microwaved.  No worries about that at Der Braumeister.  Our food was very fresh and tasty.  The sauerkraut was also excellent, probably the best I ever had.  I would go again just for the sauerkraut alone.  

I was a little disappointed in the dessert selection, which was limited to Bavarian cream (which I don't like in general), German chocolate cake (which is not an authentically German dish and furthermore tasted kind of blah), and cheesecake (again not authentic nor to my taste).  Next time I will order sausage and skip the dessert.  Also, our waitress was very young and on the impatient side, rushing us to order before we were ready and barging in on us a couple times while were deep in conversation.   I got the impression most of their customers must be regulars who know what they want without looking too hard at the fairly extensive menu.

On the plus side, the decor in this bar and restaurant is very lovely, including woodwork, booths and large German wall murals.  It was also pretty quiet, making this a nice place for a conversational dinner or intimate date."}
{"text":"Great German food.  Schnitzel, red cabbage, spätzle.  Excellent Lager selection, although the price for non-alcoholic beer is fucking astronomical.  

Prices are on-par with the level of cuisine.
I have had good and bad service, so I have mixed feelings about how the business is run.

The decor is outdated, but that is part of the charm.  The patio is nice, as is the building's exterior design."}
{"text":"Reminds me a lot of my great-grandmother's house, and that's what I'd want from an authentic German restaurant. Staff is friendly, food is good. Not a beer fan, but they've got a pretty wide selection."}
{"text":"Nice and warm German style restaurant. The beer selection is the best part! They have a nice selection of European old style beers. 

The food is a different story. Overall it is way over priced for the portion size and authenticity of German food. I grew up in Germany, and the only proper plate are the veal schnitzels. 
The rest of the menu is overpriced with bad exicution. Most people do not know the difference of authentic German food. I was really disappointed by the land jäger plate, which was a little cheese crackers and a uneven bad tasting sausage for 9$.

I can honestly say I will never eat there again. But the beer is great !"}
{"text":"If you are tasting food for the very first time ever, you might enjoy a meal here! Other than that extreme circumstance, the food is indescribably  bland.  Any normal person could make a tastier meal from a box.  It is also very expensive for what you receive.  You may say it is reasonably priced for the area but i have not had a meal anywhere near as tasteless as this anywhere around here.  The decor is outdated and the seats are uncomfortable. Seriously, if you believe this is good or even edible German food, just try preparing some yourself from  any random German food packet or box available at the supermarket; you will never eat at this restaurant again afterwards.  This restaurant isn't doing German food any favors and is the type of place that will put people off ever eating German food again. Someone needs to stop them!  It is dangerous to allow this to mascaraed as German food in any way shape or form.  It is simply awful, cheap, diner like food in a German-ish wrapper."}
{"text":"I can recommend everything we got on our first visit:

Beer:
Excellent selection of german-centric beers. We had the Hofbrau Dark, and the Aventinus. Both delicious. The Aventinus was almost twice as much, so next time, I'll just get two Hofbraus. 

Food: 
It's German Comfort Food - like Melt, but 'Schmelze.' I had the Potato Pancake Reuben. Kind of like the Grilled-Cheese-Cheese-Burger at the Beer Engine; true guilty pleasure that's worth it once a year. The Chicken Paprikash was also very good. 

I wish I had found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Best German food in town and a fantastic beer selection. I heartily recommend the schnitzel, red cabbage and spaetzel. Also try the gluhwein, German potato salad or potato soup for a stick to your bones, warm me up on a cold day option."}
{"text":"Took my daughter out for a nice Friday nite dinner. After being seated, we placed our order and then waited about 45 minutes for a glass of water and a dinner roll. We received neither. Food mightve been great, but we didnt get that far since the service was poor. Won't be visiting again any time soon. (Thats too bad, because this to be such a nice place just a few years ago.)"}
{"text":"This is real German food. From scratch. Not packaged. Atmosphere and service are warm and efficient. Servers know the beers and the menu. Wish I lived in the neighborhood to come here frequently."}
{"text":"Had not been to this place in 25 years... HOLY RIP VAN FREAKIN' WINKLE!  Anyway, great draft beer served in a dark-ish, old school bar. Worth at least a periodic trip.  The bartender and wait staff were efficient and nice. 

Now, regarding the food, I'm guessing that the sausages / sandwiches / pub food are great. Instead, our party of four opted for traditional dinners (3 orders of Weiner Schnitzel Holstein and an order of Sauerbraten). Okay, but not very flavorful. Not expensive, but I would avoid the dinner entrees. At $11 for the dinner (which includes soup or salad, choice of starch and veg) it's actually very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's an oasis in the west side neighborhood it's in. I'm into quality beer and this place is it. The beer selection is top notch. I was hooked from the  first day. They often get special brews unavailable to other US bars. At first it was a once a month trip now it's once a week. The food is good too. A potato pancake Reuben with German potato salad will do you good. Songs of \"Ein Prosit\" are known to burst out of nowhere too. I like this place because it's not like other bars with loud karaoke or other nonsense, just great beer and food. This place is special."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. The food was  delicious and priced reasonably. The German beer selection is excellent. You can also buy beer to go. The pierogies were fantastic and more crunchy than I've had before."}
{"text":"Ich liebe Der Braumeister . Ihre Jager ist unglaublich, sowie deren Paprikahuhn . Auswahl an Bier ist auch fantastisch. Sehr zu empfehlen dieses resturant für einen großen deutschen Abendessen."}
{"text":"Best German food around! Staff is always friendly, the restaurant clean, the food delicious. Prices are fair too! Love it here!"}
{"text":"this is a great little german restaurant with the bar at the entrance with a few tables. the bulk of the dining room is next to the bar. food is very good, i think the price range is pretty good considering the size of the portions. the staff is very friendly, and it is a family owned and operated business, so they care a little more about the customer if there is a problem. they do have a new website and are doing a lot of improvements lately with patio dining, etc. i usually stop in thursday evenings for the beer and you can't ask for a better selection of imports. real imports, not corona and heineken. if you like regular american beer, you wont find it here at all so stay home. more room for me. i mean it.
now they probably wont let me in.
ok, you can go if you want."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST GERMAN FOOD I've had in YEARS....and we do LOTS of traveling! I had the chicken paprikash and it was pure heaven...my family had weinerschnitzel and a variety of schnitzel w bacon and onion creamy sauce...also delicious.  We all had dessert...apple strudel, and Bavarian cream cake...it was pure German magic! Service was amazing as well.  WE WILL BE BACK AS REGULARS! YUM"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with a young friend ... was not expecting it to to be necessarily great but it was darned good ... got there a tad late -- few minutes after 8 pm -- knowing that they closed at 9 pm.  Wondered based on earlier reviews if this might be a problem.  It totally was not and the waitress could not have been nicer.  Ended up ordering sauerbraten and my dining companion ordered rahm schnitzel ... my saurerbraten was quite good, but her rahm snitchel was superb.  Very lightly breaded as it should be.  The sauerkraut was excellent as was the purple cabbage ... We both had soup ... the split pea with sausage was excellent, the potato soup was okay.  We were pretty full after we ate, but i did try a black forest torte and it was quite good.  The nice thing about the black forest torte is that while it was sweeter than it would have been in Bavaria it was not sickeningly sweet like desserts too often are in the Cleveland area.  There were no undue delays in getting food.  My only complaint is that some items including the duck special, paprikash and goulash had already sold out.

Okay, of note the great beer list had the great Ommegang Duvel Rustica ... that alone would have made it worth the visit.  Will definitely to back to this place."}
{"text":"My first Yelp Elite event!  Yay!  :o)

My husband and I had a great time.  We hung out at the event for a little while and made some sweet pretzel necklaces.  We tried a variety of appetizers (sausages, pate, potato pancakes, sauerkraut balls, chicken wings), and my husband tried two beers (one Czech, one Austrian).  My favorite of the apps were the sauerkraut balls, and my husband (who is not normally a huge wing fan) raved about the chicken wings.  

Then we made our way back into the main dining room to try out some of the other things on the menu.  We split the Reinlander Platter (smoked pork chop and bratwurst with dumplings, red cabbage, and a tossed salad) and a bowl of the German potato soup.  I really enjoyed the house sour cream and chive salad dressing.  The potato soup was just ok though - kinda bland.  We both enjoyed the two meat selections, and I really liked that they brought both horseradish and mustard on the side.  We also noticed that the dinner rolls were exceptional - warm and soft.  The \"dumplings\" were served with brown gravy, which was good.  Neither of us are very experienced eaters of this type of cuisine, and we both said \"I thought this was spaetzle.\"  They also have spaetzle on the menu, so I assume there must be some difference.  I guess I'll have to eat more German food to figure it out.  The cherry strudel we had for dessert was not particularly good.  It was warm, which was nice, but the cherries tasted like they came straight out of a can.

I definitely admired their bar menue - a nice variety of German beers on tap and not one, but three(!) different hot boozy drinks to warm you up on a snowy night.  On another night, I would have been all over that.

Overall I give it a thee because while the food and service were pleasant, nothing was good enough to make me say \"Yea, I definitely would want to come back here.\""}
{"text":"Was looking forward to tryiing der Braumeister, but was sadly disappointed.  Now, could this be because I just had a fantastic meal in Düsseldorf Germany three weeks ago and was comparing to this; perhaps,  Could it be I have family recipes from Germany and have certain expectations?  Most certainly yes.  But Most of all, I have to say I will not becoming back.  The portions were small for the price and the quality of the food(compared to das Schnitzel Hauz) was very lacking.  Jaeger Schnitzel is always a breaded veal or pork with the Jaeger gravy covering the meat.  My husbands was just a fried piece of veal with no breading.  My pork knuckle was tasty, but my German potato salad was terrible.  It tasted like it was from a can.  I prefer my 
German potato salad to be sweet and served hot, not vinegar based and served room temperature. 

Now I wish I could say it was only me that found the food to be lacking in taste and authenticity, But one of the couples we went to dinner with is from Germany, and they too were astonished at the product being presented.  

For just my husband and I, our bill was $77.  This covered two beers from him, one for me, an appetizers split with the table, and two dinners.  Granted up grading from Spitzer  to German potatoes salad cost us and additional $2 for both orders, added to this cost."}
{"text":"Stopped in with some buds on a cold night to grab some beers. The place has a ton of character and warms you up instantly. Great bottle beer selection and become a beer club member if you drink all 50. 

Happy hour from 4-7? Has some decent $5 items. We had the fried oysters to start, which were on point. Then Had the infamous potato pancake turkey Reuben for my entree.  It was good and filling but I won't be getting it again (German potato salad was fantastic).  The menu is on the smaller side, which I think works great for Der Braumeister!

Can't wait to come back for some schnitzel and live music"}
{"text":"Step back in time to Bavaria! This place has the best beer in the city. Very traditional fare German fare served here. I love the Old World Charm! All the food is from scratch, so your going to wait awhile, but it will be worth the wait. The staff is friendly and works hard.

Save me a seat and pour me a liter of Hofbrau!"}
{"text":"Der Braumeister at 13046 Lorain Ave has Bavarian style cuisine and dining room complete with a wall mural of Neuschwanstein Castle. The server even wears traditional Bavarian attire (I had no choice to love it). The restaurant has a huge beer selection which they serve in traditional style glasses for that beer. The only downfall is that there is not a \"pub\" menu but only a real dinner menu($15 for cheapest dish). Although the food tasted good, my entire dining party found that the prices were too high for the quality of food. I still recommend Der Braumeister for its charm and excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"Old World Charm restaurant.  Sauerbraten and Chicken Paprikash are delicious as are the sides of spaetzel and red cabbage.  German Potato Salad is also tasty.  Prices are a bit high for what you get.  Waitress was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This place has old world charm but the food lacks any charm.
Our service was great and that's why I give them 2 stars.
My husbands steak was well done and he specifically ordered mid rare and his side dishes lacked seasoning. 
My blueberry cheese cake almost tasted spoiled. I couldn't finish the entire thing.
The beer selection here is nice and authenticate at least. Guzzle up and the food won't be so bad!"}
{"text":"short and sweet. 

i loved the beer selection. the food was pretty good (i had the German Platter and Danielle had Weinerschnitzel). 

The server was nice

Our wait was a little bit ridiculous. we were seated right away but it took forever to get our food once we ordered. 

I'd probably go back if there was anything in the way of an actual parking lot/area. instead we had to park down the road and walk. if that doesn't bother you, check it out. it's good."}
{"text":"Fine old German restaurant! Went there for lunch with my much-better-half. She had the Pork hock (like a shank) with bread dumplings and saurkraut ($10 at lunch)....I had the kielbasa sandwich ($6.95) with the German potato soup($2.75 for a cup). Overall, very good (not \"unforgetable\" but a good solid meal.) Service was attentive. Several happy schnitzel-eaters sitting nearby who were very pleased with their meals. Supposedly, their best entree but not my favorite. Lots of beer choices and a nice owner. Located on Lorain near 130th street.  I'll go back, but, for my taste, I prefer the Old Prague in Vermilion."}
{"text":"Every now and then you've gotta stop in there and get some schnitzel, I like it breaded with with the bacon onion gravy on the side.  Spetzel's were good but far from hot when the meal was deliveried.  Sauerkraut was really sour, tasted kinda weird, I wish I would have ordered the red cabbage instead.
Non-alcohol beer, $4.00, pricey !
Server was friendly, asked me as she was darting into another room, \"taste good\" too bad she didn't stick around for my answer.  Waited awhile for her to clear my plate and take my money but that never happened.  Had to pay my bill at the bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here and really wanted to love it. We are both fans of German food and realize any ethnic food has its chef's personal twist on their dishes. It just didn't do it for us. Others raved about the sauerkraut balls. They were quite different than we were use to. My schnitzel looked delicious but may have been fried in oil that was used for many other foods before mine. The spaetzel and red cabbage was wonderful. My husbands sauerbraten was good (not great). 
The beer was great and the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I love their Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein & Spätzle. It's the best!!! I'm never let down, including tonight."}
{"text":"This place exudes charm with its wood paneled walls and antiquated bar.  The pierogis were excellent - crispy on the outside and delicious throughout.  The sauerbraten was good but dry and there are better places for this.  The potato soup needs improvement as it was watery and lacked flavor. The choice of German beer on tap was good as was their extensive collection of nutcrackers.  Overall a good place for beer and pierogis."}
{"text":"Well, we got invited to a Yelp Elite Event at Der Braumeister, and, as always, we were not disappointed.

We started off just going to hob nob a bit and sample some of the snacks they had there (I was a bit disappointed, as I couldn't sample their fine ales, but I had to work later that night, so, just food for me thanks:) We got to sample sauerkraut balls, pate' and their great potato pancakes, but we couldn't just stop there; we stayed and had a full dinner too. 

Der Braumeister is located off of Lorain Road and is a nice little German departure from the outside world on a cold evening. The place is warm, woody and cozy, with good food and really great service (A shout out to Julia, our waitress, who was absolutely amazing:) My wife sampled their ales, and she enjoyed them immensely. For myself, the schnitzel was tasty, the German potato salad was great and a piece of their apple strudel topped things off nicely:) The bar at the front was impressive, and overall, you felt like you could have been somewhere in the mountains enjoying some native fare. 

I think the only difficulty here...not enough parking. The restaurant has very tiny back row of spaces, and most of the rest is either street or side-street parking, so get there early if you want to partake of their tasty treats. 

So, if you are looking for a bit of Germany...in Cleveland and you want a great place for good food, good drinks and a place that's relaxing, I say YA! to Der Braumeister!

BTW, just another shout out to Cara and the ladies who did a great job with the event!"}
{"text":"Best bar in Cleveland! Great beer selection and drinks. This is the real deal folks. Locals are very welcoming and the food is not only great, but priced right. Go here."}
{"text":"Review based on a patio experience.  First off our server (who was also the bar tender) and the food were awesome.  Our table got the Asbach Chicken Schnitzel and the Chicken Paprikash.  Both were quality dishes and enough to take home and enjoy the next day.  My biggest issue was the atmosphere of the patio.  We had questionable characters wander up to us and ask for money and to borrow our phones to call for a ride.  Fire trucks also went sounding by two different times.  I would recommend checking them out inside because outside was not a relaxing and enjoyable dining occasion."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be.  Space inside is very limited.  It seams they rely on a big bar business.  The food is decent but the portions are very small and the price tag does not match.  The staff is not as friendly as they used to be.  the have a little store off the side that is not worth the trouble.  Prices are high."}
{"text":"Wonderful German meal.  Sauerbraten hit the spot, savory red cabbage and the best spaetzle I ever ate.  Old Fashion cocktail, crafted with care.
A casual storefront, a bit taken aback, the entrance is more like a corner bar, greeted warmly and shown to the restaurant area.  Very casual, a bit noisy, but a real neighborhood feel.  Our server, well versed in their wines and beers.  An enjoyable evening, would come back.."}
{"text":"I have been a patron here for many years and it's one of those timeless Bars/Restaurants whose great atmosphere is always robust and welcoming. Der Braumeister is well-known for its selection of German as well as Belgian beers on tap and in bottles, with some American craft brews added for good measure. The authentic German cuisine is always freshly prepared and served in a timely fashion. On this day I ordered the Ratatouille Salad which is more than enough food to satisfy the hunger pangs associated with imbibing fine German brews. Sitting at the old-fashioned bar stools, you are always guaranteed to interact with the locals who are experts in German Culture. I would highly recommend an early afternoon visit, due to the extreme popularity after dark. Prost!"}
{"text":"Krompus Rompus was on Friday, 12/27. 

It was a blast!  Der Braumeister pulled out all stops.  The draft beer menu was STELLAR!  Hands-down THE best seasonal beer menu in CLEVELAND.   Check it out as it will blow your mind!

The Chardon Polka Band was performing.  They got the entire restaurant rocking.   KROMPUS arrived too!  They had 3 different flavors of KROMPUS too.  With cowbells attached to the smalls of their backs, they were getting jiggy a la krewking.  It was a lot of FUN!

The had a few drink and dinner specials marking the event.  They had this wicked tasty, high octane mulled wine w/ 151 rum.  It gets light to create a carmelized flavor.  The flames were light behind the bar, not table-side (too crowded).  The alcohol content was not compromised as the flaming was short lived.

We started out with sauerkraut balls.  I just love saying \"balls\" when ordering  -  it cracks me up (yes, I have a 10 year old mentality).  I was sad to know they revamped their recipe.  It was as though they pulverized the sauerkraut in the food processor until it was a puree.  The texture was sooooo weird, I did not care for it.

Our table had a variety of entrees ordered:  chicken paprikas with spatzel, potato pancakes, sausages, traditional pork schnitzel, veal schnitzel w/ egg over easy, anchovies and capers, German style potato salad, red cabbage and sauerkraut.  Due to the prices, it was a bit odd that the entrees do not include bread on the table nor some sort of starter, like a small cup of soup.   The food was good but not for the price.  They need to drop their prices a few dollars.

Considering how packed the joint was combined with the awkward lay-out, the service was good.  Our server was extremely bubbly and accommodating without being annoying.  It was refreshing.

The positives out-weighed the food.  I will definitely return for the beer.  I will look forward to any future events that Der Braumeister throws!!"}
{"text":"classic German and euro cuisine and the best imported beers in town. Foodies and beer aficionados don't miss out....Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. We started with appetizers and ordered sauerkraut balls, German potato salad, and potato pancakes. They were all freshly prepared to perfection. My favorite was the sauerkraut balls, but I could easily eat the warm German potato salad for a week ( breakfast lunch and dinner) straight.
We also had the Weiner Schnitzel for an  entree with   Spätzle and red cabbage. This kitchen is clearly a scratch kitchen and they are dang good at it.  If I was a drinker, I would be in an imported beer smorgasbord as they carry at least 50 varieties.  Our server was Hannah. She was very courteous and efficient.  Great food, service and atmosphere at this gem of a family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finding myself in Cleveland and needing to acclimate to the 3-hour time difference (quickly), I Yelp'd for restaurants near my hotel near the airport and found Der Braumeister, which sounded perfect!  Beer & Schnitzel, right?  

On their Yelp page, I saw that they closed at 10, (but upon further review, I see that their webpage says they close at 9).  I got there around 8:30, which I didn't think was late, and was greeted by a pretty, blond woman who let me know that the dining room was closed but I could sit at the bar, which was ok.  

This place has more German beers than most bars I've been to in Germany!  I settled on a Hofbräu Dunkel (Dark), which was good.  For dinner, I ordered the Austrian Schnitzel, which came with choice of soup or salad (I chose Potato soup), potato or dumpling (I chose the dumpling and regretted it immediately), and the sauerkraut.  She had her back to me as she was entering my order on her computer.  At this point, I asked her about the salad, and she said, \"Oh, we're going back to the salad now?\"  This was as unnecessary a comment as I've ever heard from a waitress, but there it was and I was put off by it.  As soon as she finished my order, she ran back to the kitchen and I heard her yell, \"We got another one ordering...!\"  Whoa!  Maybe this place doesn't really want people eating here!  Another patron came in 15 minutes after me and got the exact same treatment and he was made to feel bad for ordering close to their closing time!  What's going on here?  This is NO way to treat customers that want to spend money at their establishment!

The food came out and it was good.  I should've gotten the potatoes instead of the dumplings.  They were okay, but too filling.  The schnitzel and sauerkraut were excellent!  The woman bartender/waitress became nicer to me and to the guy who came after me, but the initial attitude to both of us (separately) was so unneccessary and counter-productive to what should've been a nice evening and dinner out.  

So the bottom line for me is, the food was good, the service was good, but her initial attitude was anything but inviting and welcoming.  That said, I will not ding this place more because of that."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and true ethnic food, always prepared the way it should be."}
{"text":"Okay there is lots of different beers, err....bier.  While asking for a pale ale, I started with  hoffbrau house orginal really a lager. It was ein gut bier, not unlike the goldie locks, just right.  Between a couple of maibock and austrian lagers the beer choices were excellent and I finished with food.  Latka is highly recomended.  Rumor is they have a reuben, stuffed between two potato pancakes.  I opted for Chicken Paprichish.  Yes a great choice.  Almost perfect food, just needs a little more sauce added to it.  Flavor and spatezel is excellent.  It was worth filling stomach and drinking less.  I cant think of a better thing to say."}
{"text":"Der Braumeister is a Cleveland gem. Located in Cleveland's West Park neighborhood, this place is one part German restaurant/beer hall and one part deli and market. Did I mention they also have a killer patio (never mind the loud Lorain Avenue traffic; after a few German brews you won't even notice)? 

After moving back home to Cleveland after a four-year absence I was looking forward to tapping (no pun intended) back into the bar/restaurant scene. What a way to start things off. This place sated my inner beer geek with a beer list that's heavy on the Deutschland brews - as it should be and a large rotating selection of taps. On the eve of our visit I sampled two selections from La Chouffe (La Chouffe Blonde and Houblon Chouffe), a lovely De Koninck Belgian amber and a few others I can't seem to remember right now. For some reason, it's all a bit fuzzy. The bottom line with Der Braumeister's beer selection is that it's undeniably German and it's good. If you can't pronounce it that's all the more reason to try it. Be not afraid, der bier ist gud.

Now for the food. We started our meal with the Landjager platter. This is essentially a German take on charcuterie. Give me some cured smoked meat, cheese, mustard and horseradish and I'm one happy guy. 

Since I'm from good German stock (sometime way back when anyway) I've always had a soft spot for schnitzel and potato salad. But one thing I'd been craving for years has been chicken paprikash. The problem? It's pretty damn hard to find any restaurant that even knows what it is let alone how to make it right. Well slap my leiderhosen-laden ass and call me Hans, Der Braumeister nails it. They make one of the best chicken paprikash dishes I've ever tasted (sorry grandma) and the this includes the spaetzel. Tender, juicy, hearty and full of love, it didn't matter that it was nearly 90 degrees outside, I downed the entire thing.

My wife went with the Bavarian pretzel sandwich - warm Bavarian ham, slightly sweet and salty, Swiss cheese, pungent and nutty, a schmear of seedy German mustard, and fresh lettuce and tomato. The only downside of this dish was a logistical one. Whereas most would assume this was served on a pretzel bun, most would be wrong. The Der Braumeister version is served on an actual pretzel. This makes it a tad difficult to eat as things keep wanting to slip out of the big holes. A challenge, but one well worth undertaking.

As if all that weren't enough, we actually had room for dessert. We opted for the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream. Sure, they had some other things on the menu like tiramisu cheesecake and some kind of torte, but if you're doing the German thing you've gotta go strudel. The pastry was warm, flaky and cooked a gleaming golden brown and the apples inside were soft and sweet. A perfect ending to our meal, wunderbar!

I can't wait to get myself back to Der Braumeister to try some fried sauerkraut balls and a potato pancake reuben sandwich. With friendly service that respects your wont to take your time and German food that's as good as any you'll find outside of Dusseldorf, it's no wonder Der Braumeister was named one of the Top 20 Beer Bars in the US by Men's Health magazine. So the next time you're craving some kummelweck or you've got a hankerin' for some Hungarian goulash, head over to Der Braumeister..knee slapping and oompah optional."}
{"text":"Very bland. Expensive for what it is. You would be better off maling it yourself. I really wanted to like this place, but I can't. Servers were friendly, though."}
{"text":"Went for lunch ordered veal schnitzel, spätzle & kraut. The veal was so thin and small I wasn't sure it was there at all. The meal was completely flavorless except for the sauerkraut. I also ordered crab stuffed mushroom caps. They must have had a string in the crab and dragged it across the mushrooms. Flavorless. The portion of veal was a disappointment. I left hungry. Meal was very bland and flavorless. I used to enjoy this place. Don't know what happened. It was a $25 lunch. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a Groupon and I am glad they offered the deal because I would not have come in otherwise, mainly because I didn't know the place existed until I saw it on Groupon! I ordered the german platter that was 1 sausage and 1 piece of pork weinerschnitzel, red cabbage, and german potato salad.  My plate was large, and tasty enough that I only had a little bit of potato left over to take home. Pretty solid German food except for the bratwurst. It was supposed to come with some other kind of sausage but they were out of it so I chose the brat. It was way too processed, like a mushy breakfast sausage.

My husband ordered the chicken paprikash and he really enjoyed it. It was also big enough that he was stuffed but he ate the whole thing. We also shared the sauerkraut balls as an appetizer. Those were average. I would not get them again. They were a little more doughy and didn't taste very much like sauerkraut to me. I also didn't like the dipping sauce they came with - cocktail sauce. Honey mustard or something like that would have been better. 

I thought the prices were too high. Each entree was around $15-$19 and they were decently sized portions as I mentioned above but the place is more divey than upscale. I don't think I will return unless I have another coupon. 

Our waitress was very sweet and nice. I think her name was Brittany. There were two older ladies also waiting on tables and they were not friendly at all. One of them brought us our check and she just kind of slapped it down onto the table without saying a word and walked away quickly. The place was fairly busy especially for a Tuesday night. Almost every table was full! But it is not a huge place either. Parking is street or a small lot behind the building."}
{"text":"Service was lackluster. The restaurant wasn't busy when I went. My pork tasted like ham but my husband's schnitzel was reeally good. I was jealous. I like the old world feel as well."}
{"text":"If your looking for bad customer service. This is the place!  The manager refused to come out and explain why we had to wait an hour and a half for our food. If I wasn't there with my whole family, I would of left"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place the other night on a groupon.  It was fantastic!  The food was great and the draft beer selection was good.  The bartender was very knowledgeable on the beers and was able to help me decide.  I like this place for your German cravings over Hofbräuhaus!  Prost!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering off of UberEats so this review is only for the food. 

*Sauerkraut Balls $5.95 - Meh, the breading tasted off to me and why the heck is this paired with cocktail sauce? I would not order this again. 
*Cucumber Salad $5.95 - Refreshing, tasty, and a large portion meant to share. 
*Bavarian Pretzel $5.95 - Nice thick soft pretzel that paired well with the beer cheese dip (ask for extra dip!). 
*Potato Pancakes $5.95 - I liked that this was more pancake than hashbrown. Uniquely appealing with the sour cream and applesauce to top it with. 
*Pierogies $6.95 - We got one cheddar and one ricotta. I could not taste any cheddar, just potato. The ricotta was freaking awesome though. Tasted slightly sweet with some cinnamon? They are large sized but I think $7 is a little bit pricey for just 2. 
*Chicken Parikash $16.95 - Tasty. I prefer shredded white chicken, but with this version you will get a whole piece of white and one of dark meat, whatevs, still good. Spatzel was like delicious little puffs of cloud. You get a roll with your dinner but that's it. (The Little Polish Diner sells this dish for only $9.95)
*German Platter $16.95 - Would recommend if you would like a nice sampling of things. I especially liked the red cabbage and the schnitzel, the German potato salad had too much of a vinegar taste for me. 

I think some items are a little bit overpriced. We did enjoy a majority of the food though, has a hearty home cooked feel to it. Decent portion sizes. I would continue to order from them. My only complaint is that the to-go containers are of that soft recycled kind so they turn soggy when anything warm and juicy is put inside."}
{"text":"I'd like to see Warsteiner always on tap but other than that it's solid German food and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant in years past when I worked in the area. So I stopped in for a quick beer. Happy I did so, ended up having German potatoe pancakes along with a knock wurst sandwich. Wonderful!! The service was great the server friendly and helpful. If you like German this is your place."}
{"text":"A Saturday night meal here was comfortable, quiet, and quaint.  With a very large selection of beers, some even specially imported here, the price was moderate with some of their fruit lambic beers being a bit to expensive for my taste.  We got fried oysters (which were delicious but a bit expensive for five pieces) and pierogies, which my friends said were delicious, for appetizers.  I ended up getting the veal oscar, which was lightly breaded veal topped with crab meat and my boyfriend got Hungarian Style Goulash that was Tender Pieces of Beef simmered with Green Pepper, Tomato and Onion in a Thick Gravy and served over Spaetzle.  I'm not going to lie, the prices threw me a bit but the portions were quite large.  The veal was very tender as was the goulash so props to them for getting the meat just rice.  My only gripe about my dish was that the crab pieces were definetly imitation crab:(, which was a bit disappointing.  The red cabbage, which was pickled I believe, had a soft and good flavor.  The potatoes were good maybe needed a bit more seasoning but a solid four for this establishment.  The waitress really knew her stuff and gave us a good description of each food and beer, I just wasn't blown away by the food, though my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his beer.  Parking here was a bit rough as well.  Hopefully you get lucky and find a parking spot on the street.  Overall a great experience with some good ole German food."}
{"text":"Found this place doing a internet search, was not in the least disappointed. Small parking lot in the rear, enter thru the bar was a bit dis enchanting but the dining room more than makes up for it. Great old time decor, wood paneling and antiques throughout. Great menu with many choices. Large beer and wine menu. If you have never had kwok it's a must try. 

Food is fantastic, portions were perfect. The sauerbraten is so good, best I've had in years. Red cabbage and spatzel perfect. Must try the potato pancakes also. Schnitzel was lightly breaded, perfectly cooked and the sauce spot on.

Service impeccable, waitress (Katrina) not only knew the menu but explained it and shared her favorites. Wil be returning for sure."}
{"text":"WOW!  Came into Cleveland for business and found this Gem!  The Sauerkraut balls were tasty as were the Pierogi's. Yep that was a good start.  Washed it down with what else....ice cold beer.  The main course of schnitzel was delightful especially when paired with the potato pancakes, carrots and of course more beer!  We didn't have any room for dessert but they all looking amazing.

Oh almost forgot the decor, I felt like I had walked into a family restaurant in Heidelberg.  It had a real traditional feel.

Can't believe I am saying this but I actually look forward to my next trip to Cleveland so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has a classic dark wood bar that really reminds you of the old bars in Germany.  

The food is above average, but average for German cuisine.  I have been here twice now, and I am not a fan of the soups.  I would recommend any of the sausages.  The authentic beer selection made this place receive the fourth star. the last time I visited, they had several unique Christmas/seasonal beers on tap.  Unique = not from Ohio.  

The service is very friendly and prompt.  

I will be going here again.

One word to the wise, men do not go number 1 at the same time.  There is 2 urinals, but you might need some yoga positioning to use them at the same time."}
{"text":"If you like German beer, this place is great. The food however is just OK, and the last three times we have been there the service was just appallingly slow and shoddy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious German food, this is the #1 spot! We've been going here for years as a family and this place is outstanding. The Wiener Schnitzel is the best in Cleveland in my opinion and they always have delicious home-cooked soups that are sure to warm you up in the colder months!

I personally love the atmosphere too. It is dark inside but adds a nice intimacy and old-world feel to it which is perfect for a German restaurant.

I highly recommend this place! One of my favorite places to eat in CLE!"}
{"text":"It's a good special occasion place, especially if your family has any inkling of German ancestry. The inside dining area is nice enough where you wouldn't be out of place dressed up, although I was casual enough to be at the bar.

The German food I had wasn't bland, it was pretty standard German food (a culture that cares more about it's beer than food in some cases). The sauerkraut balls were a fantastic sharing appetizer.

The price was a few dollars higher per person than expected. Coming out to a $16 average per plate. Not sure if that's due to the \"better than most on Lorain Ave.\" interior decor, or just that the portions are on the large side.

Parking was not ample, barely squeezed into the spot by a grease dumpster out back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of German beer.  Wait, let me clarify - I'm a fan of GOOD German beer.  So to find a place with 50+ German beers made Der Braumeister a must try in my book.  But come for the beer and stay for the food!

The place is run by a family from Southern Germany and is the most authentic German restaurant I've been to in the US.  It reminded me of the little local restaurants I used to go to when I was in Stuttgart.  The flavors are authentic and not dumbed down for the uninitiated.  Their Wiener Schnitzel (that's veal, by the way - not chili dogs) was amazing as was their potato pancake Reuben - YUM!"}
{"text":"This is a very popular spot, with a lot of regulars and an authentic German atmosphere. The beer selection was very good when I was there. Prices are fair, and the food was adequate. There are a lot of adequate places to get a beer, so for me it's all about service. On that measure, Der Braumeister fell flat on my last visit. 

I ordered a wheat beer (weizen) which was good, and my next selection was a darker beer (doppelbock). It was served literally at room temperature. I mentioned this to the server, who pointed me to a woman identified as the owner. The owner proceeded to inform me that I do not know how beer should be served, that this beer is not supposed to be ice cold. 

I understand beer very well, and I also understand that doppelbock should be served at a temperature between 55-60 degrees, not room temperature of 70 from a warm bottle. I was shocked by the rudeness of this woman and the manner in which she dismissed my concern. Others at my table had the same issue with beer from the same cooler. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Parking space is limited. First impression of the place feels authentic and a little dated. The server Brittany was super sweet and very attentive. The beer I ordered came about 10 minutes after my boyfriends did, which was odd. Had the potato pancakes as an app and the goulash as my entree and both were good! Would go back again."}
{"text":"Let's start by admitting that there's nothing else like it in Cleveland. Old-school German classics, largely prepared from scratch. All the food is complemented by a dazzling beer list that's heavy on excellent German and Belgian drafts. Yes, the food is not quite as good as it was a few years ago and yes, the service can sometimes be as slow as the average walker-assisted patron, but the whole package is still pretty great. Besides, you can't beat the sensation of being in your granny's basement, surrounded by wood paneling and eating sauerbraten prepared in the classic style. The bar attached to the restaurant is an obvious beer-drinker's delight, and the store attached to that is full of German goodies. You can't make places like this anymore, and we should all cherish them while we have a chance."}
{"text":"Great Wienerschnitzel, red cabbage and spaetzle...just like Germany in 1964!
I love it when they have duck! I've only been able to catch it a few times, it's not always on the menu.
No waiting on Saturdays, even after 5pm."}
{"text":"A West Side landmark. The goulash was very tasty but not what I'm used to. The waitress was dressed in a festive old fashioned German costume. Kinda silly. Most of the customers were at the bar. They now have a patio for smokers- maybe that will drum up more business. It was much busier years ago, but then German food I guess is not as popular as it used to be."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in on a Thursday night. Had heard this place was fairly authentic and had good food.  Ehhhhh.   Not really.  Their draft beers are mostly US craft \"knockoffs\".  Why not get authentic German draft?  As far as food- they try I suppose- certainly menu is German.  But quality is sub par.  The sauerkraut balls were supposed to be special here .   Again ... just average.  Summary : price is above quality and quantity.  Service was decent. Just an ehhhh !  For me"}
{"text":"In short, you can have a conversation without screaming, beers are delicious, food over priced.
I had the goat cheese ravolis and really enjoyed my meal. The other people with us thought the food was okay. It is overpriced for what you get compared to other restaurants in the area. The service could have been a little better. The server forgot two of our drinks."}
{"text":"Food & service were good. I was on the job so couldn't try the beer :-(  This place truly has old world charm and I'm hoping to go back again when I can sample the brews! There were so many tempting things on the menu I had a hard time choosing but opted for the sauerbraten. It wasn't as good as my mom's but not bad. The sauerkraut balls really didn't do it for me, but I'm not much of a fried food lover. I'll try anything once though!"}
{"text":"1. Ambiance: the bar area looks like Parma, the inside looks like Germany or Hungary. So it's got something for everyone!

2. Beer: I ordered the De Koninck amber ale, which was served in a sifter. It was so drinkable, I'm about to order a second. Not too hoppy, not bitter, not too sweet: exactly what I expect from a German ale. The other beers on tap - all imports, apart from the Rogue Dead Guy - also appear to be phenomenal. I also ordered the Korbinian: a chocolatey, malty doppelbock... I'm guzzling it down as I type this. It has an otherworldly caramel aftertaste that I have not experienced before.

3. Food: I love that the butter (to accompany a better-than-average dinner roll) was warm and spreadable; nothing ruins good bread like cold butter. Potato soup was not salty, but not screaming with flavor either. The skin on my Schwein Hox was crispy and savory in parts, though the meat was on the drier side; my bratwurst was rich and meaty, and not too salty. Overall, I think the food is presented well, and, while meaty, lacks subtlety in its flavors.

Summary: though the food was only above-average, I can't resist the allure of sitting down to a plate of sausages and sauerkraut... And the beer here really makes the experience. So I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great authentic German restaurant!
I lived in Europe for 5 months and that food and beer at Der Braumeister is wonderful and tastes just like the real thing. The wiener schnitzel is awesome and they have a great variety of dark and light beer."}
{"text":"One of the best for German beer selection and Authentic German Food. Wish the girls would wear Dirndl's all the time. A bit pricey though. But worth it. All quality. Bee hive desert."}
{"text":"I dined at Der Braumeister last weekend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I ate here once many years ago and was not impressed with the jagerschnitzel. I have not had much luck finding a good jagerschnitzel since Germany so maybe I'm just hard to please.

Granted, I did not order the jagerschnitzel this time, I was impressed with the liver dumpling soup and the schweinebraten with duplings. I even noticed a vegetarian maultaschen (large ravioli usually filled with spiced pork but instead filled with spinach and goat cheese) on the menu which is very uncommon in outside of Bavaria.

The beer was great and the service was even better. They have a full range of German beers from hefeweizen to pilsner."}
{"text":"Pretty good German food - pretty good wursts, and whatnot. Nothing to rave about but good beer list for sure. 3*"}
{"text":"Food for me is super tasteless, Pierogis are off the roof. Beer selection is pretty decent & service is good"}
{"text":"I had the Sauerbraten and it was so moist and tender . My husband had the schnitzel and that was perfect too , completely impressed.. Down to the rolls !"}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 5. We waited to be seated as the sign states. A few waitresses passed us and said they'd be right with us although they didn't make eye contact and weren't friendly. After a few minutes of this a different woman approached us and said she'd seat us, came back and offered us a dirty high top table with 1 stool at it. The most this table could seat would be 3, 2 people comfortably, definitely not 5, and not dirty with 1 stool to sit on!! She made no attempts to clean it off, we asked for a booth but were told no even though there were plenty of empty ones. We left! I wouldn't even bother to come back here after the crummy service just trying to have a seat!"}
{"text":"Oh my, sooo good! If you want authentic German food and bier this is the place to go. I had the schweine haxen, spatzle and sauerkraut absolutely delicious. This place zer gut! I know whatever you order you will be very happy with! Reminds me of my days in Augsburg Germany."}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying the beer selection is probably 4 stars or higher - good German brews at really reasonable prices. 

I'd never had German food before (except for an obligatory sausage or pretzel here and there) so I came to Der Braumeister for dinner on a stop in Cleveland. The bar looked great - really nice all wood bar with some televisions for game watching. 

The dining room was old fashioned - which i liked - wood booths and plastic-y table cloths. They have a ton of meal options and I got the pierogies to start (very, very good) and then a sausage medley. Two of the sausages were interesting and good but the other was essentially a US hot dog and not really the best of US hot dogs either. 

I walked away from the place feeling good, not great, about what I had eaten and felt sure that if I lived in Cleveland it would be a place I would come back to, certainly for the beer."}
{"text":"I think I've forgotten everything I learned in my one year of German language in college.  Oops?  I realized this because Der Braumeister brings out all the lacking German in me...I heard smatterings around the bar and I even felt silly ordering \"HB\".  (Oops, that's HaufBrau).  

But that is the key to an authentic German restaurant.  It feels very European and I was especially excited about all the ethnic beers.  I didn't order food but will be sure to return, even if just for the Sauerkraut Balls.  

Sure, maybe it's on a stretch of Lorain that I don't often visit, but maybe I need to be changing that around."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner on a super hot night, but ordered heavy European dinner anyway because they specialize in German and other central European dishes. We were pleasantly surprised with the taste and quality of the food. I have an obsession for food for this region, and we really enjoyed it! They have an immense, impressive beer list from Germany and beyond. We would definitely go back. Service was helpful and friendly even under the circumstances of the weather and some high-maintenance intoxicated patrons around us. Loved it!"}
