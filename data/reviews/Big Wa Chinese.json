{"text":"Came in because it's close to work and wanted something new. Ordered my food to go and when I arrive there wasn't anyone dining in. After I placed my order about four parties arrived to dine in. After 15 mins I noticed that a few of the dine in orders were making their way out and even notice the delivery guy leave and return. I finally was given my order over 30 mins after I placed it. The more irritating part of the whole situation is that as I was walking out every single party had their food and many were half through it. To top off the experience the food was the quality of a cheap microwave dinner. I do not recommend this place for take out, and with the taste of the food I do not even think I'd even attempt to try to dine in."}
{"text":"Has a diner feeling. The food may not be incredible but its good in my opinion. The service is among the best for this type of place."}
{"text":"Gave a try because the menu has a lot of vegetarian options, unlike china restaurant which has none, and golden eggroll, which has been good so far but I'm looking for more spice and flavor outside of thai food.

Threw 3/4 of the food away! I got orange tofu, totally inedible. The tofu is cut too large, fried too low so it just soaked up the grease, and the massive pool of sauce was a really strange tasting, thick gluey mess. It tasted like old donuts, you know, the ones you regret immediately & that was this whole meal lol. 

The mushu vegetables were ok but too salty, not worth going back for. The 'pancakes' (raw flour tortillas) came with a busted hoisin sauce on them, which had such an odd yeasty sweet smell, i didn't even risk it.

Closer than golden eggroll, but I'll just drive the extra mile. No wonder it was dead inside."}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times. I really like the food named \"House Special\" because that means it has everything in it!!! My favorites are the Happy family and House Special Lo Mein. They taste VERY GOOD. I don't need to waste my time on deciding whether I should choose chicken or beef. But, I would like to try other foods too, since all their dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Took my family to this place. I was concerned because when iwalked in it was empty. I came around dinner time 4pm just in time for their lunch specials. 
We all ordered with rice and one egg roll with our choice of entree. Food was cooked and hot. We didn't have to wait long for our food.
The waitress was friendly and everything we asked she had the answer too. 
I remember a long time ago this place used to be a buffet but it's the same family but new owners? 
Over all nothing really wrong about this review."}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and sour pork with pot stickers and fried rice.  Order took over and hour to get here, the fried rice was white rice, no sweet and sour sauce and no pot sticker sauce.  HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in Arizona! Maybe the World! The chicken lo mein is my favorite. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was very bad. The dishes all tasted old. It was not authentic. They used a lot of vegetables to fill in and cover up small portions. I ordered sweet n sour shrimp. It had an after taste. $40 for inedible food."}
{"text":"Reaaaaaalllly bad food poisoning, it was rough. I would not recommend. It tasted good though but still not worth the heartburn and nausea."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and have to have Chinese. This was closest so I checked them out. Brought home $30 in food You get free stuff if you buy a certain amount. They shorted me on the free eggrolls. The food was so bad no one would eat it, not even the dog. That was $30 in the trash! One star cuz they were friendly. Told me next time I come in they'll give me the eggrolls. Try Gol
den Eggroll. About a mile away and great food!"}
{"text":"Great food always fresh just wish the wait time was a little shorter other than that great price and great meal i had here if you dont mind the wait definetly recommend it"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to, the interior is very pleasing and inviting, but you wouldn't be able to tell how amazing this place is just by passing it by. The food is fast and oh so delicious and to make things even better the staff is extremely friendly and make sure you're please. My family and I love coming here and we are very happy we found this place we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was disgusting!  Should be no star option!  Everything comes covered in thick gooey slime that tastes like orange chicken. I order General Tso to be brought what looked and tasted like orange chicken. When I called this to their attention I was told that yes General Tso is orange chicken just spicier. Since when?!?!  The General Tso I have eaten everywhere else had more of a BBQ taste to it. A co worker order sesame chicken which also looked and tasted of orange chicken. Also when ordering I just the lunch special number and was rudely told just tell me the name. My lunch party was not even happy with the fortune cookies. Save yourself your money and most of all your taste buds and don't come here!!!!"}
{"text":"1st time ever ordering from here. I Placed a pick up order for the Wor Wonton soup! They had it ready in 15 mins. Was Greeted by friendly staff. Soup was so yummy and filled up to the top. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars, was because the pork was a little too overdone (dry) and the wontons were more soggy than I'm use to-but honestly I'd prefer things to be over done than undercooked. Will be back to try a lunch special!"}
{"text":"Impressed by the food and service! When you drive by this place you may automatically think this place must not be a tasteful place to eat at. But once you go in you will change your mind. The price for each dish is very reasonable and do serve enough to fill, especially the lunch menu. This place is definitely on my list to eat at during my lunch on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese Food EVER! The General Tso was all dough, the fried rice was bland, the egg drop soup had corn in it, and the lo mein was bland and dry. Never again."}
{"text":"Please be assured while reading this that I'm not normally one to have issues and complain. However the poor quality service that we'd received from Big Wa was angering and outrageous! I would totally give 0 stars for this review if possible based off of the bad (literally, and seriously) food and poor customer service.

Simply put one night we ordered from them, around they're closing time. After delivery the food below sub-par. The crab puffs and egg rolls were horridly pastey like they weren't cooked or were possibly old and soggy. Also the food was was pretty cold as well. The restaurant is only approx. less than 10m away so the poor quality of food was very disappointing. On top of that my friend ate his food (which he hadn't eaten anything else prior to eating his Big Wa meal all day) and got a really very bad upset stomach later that evening (actually in the early AM). The next day my friend told me about what a bad upset stomach ( to put it nicely) he'd had after eating his food and so I decided to call Big Wa and request his portion of the meal be taken off my debt payment. All the food was poor quality, sure but I decided to be an \"accommodating customer\" and only request that my friend's potion be removed from my bill instead of asking for a refund because of my friend being the only one who had any discomfort/ **bad gastrointestinal issues** (to put it nicely)  from the food.

Well, to wrap this up, let's just say that I very calmly described the issue to the person on the phone at Big Wa and instead of being courteous and helpful they argued with me until I decided that I'd had enough! 

They also told me that in order for them to do any thing in regards to my bad food that:
1.Quote \"They'd have to have q driver come pick up the food in order to prove that it was bad. \"

2. That quote \"since they were a small restaurant\" that they'd \"have no way of recalling my order\" (from less than 24 hours) to this complaint call. And...

3. The most furiating!...They said (paraphrasing, but quoting...)that \"my friend had to go to to doctor to prove the food caused my friend's stomach upset.\" P.s. my friends stomach wasn't just \"upset\"...I'm trying to be polite in saying while he didn't throw up, he did have some sort of \"major major gastrointestinal\" upset as a result from the food from Big Wa. 

I called originally to *request only a portion* of my bill be taken off and ***ended the call *** with actually having to call my bank and dispute the bill in it's entirety! I tipped the driver pretty well too...and I'll be damned if I give any more money to this place now or ever!  Ai have the food in my fridge and as soon as I get in touch with my bank's ACH Disputes Dept. I'm going to have Big WA's driver come pick up their nasty food as proof! {Since that's what the person who I spoke with at Big Wa asked me to do after all, return my food as proof!) How ridiculous! This place is bad. Don't support this local restaurant! There's got to be better places....Keep looking until you find one with GREAT food AND customer service!

This place sux, pass it on!"}
{"text":"Why this establishment has less than 5 stars is beyond me
*****- for their prices.
*****- for the quality of the food.
*****- for the QUANTITY of food.
*****- for the friendliness of the staff.
***??- for appearance and cleanliness.

I will definitely tell others about this delicious place. Thank you

I came back the same day for more to take to my family. They loved it!"}
{"text":"Me and my bf went to have an early dinner/late lunch at 4:10 pm when their lunch ended but they still let us order from the lunch menu. I got beef lo mein and he got Mongolian chicken. Food was right sized and very tasty which left me really full. Waitress was nice enough to bring down blinds at our table when we got hot from the sun. They do everything to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"Places like this make me question what other Yelpers are talking about with their great reviews. So perplexing. 

Had a shrimp dish, sesame chicken with fried rice and house special chicken. 

The food was all so unremarkable. It truly didn't taste bad but conversely it didn't taste good and wasn't even as good as Panda Express. The fried shrimp were huge but strangely 90% breading and fried stuff. The fried rice inexplicably had ONLY rice. No egg, veggies, anything. It was just rice with a tan. So odd. 

More power to you if this spot is your thing- but I truly don't get it. Very boring/basic flavors and not much effort put into it."}
{"text":"Read some pretty good reviews so we decided to try this place out. We ordered delivery through Yelp Eat24 and let me just say, we will NEVER be ordering from this place again. Not only did it take over an hour 1/2 to get the food, by the time we got it, everything was cold. The host (whoever answered the phone) lied and said the food was being delivered but she would tell the driver to get there \"ASAP.\" To me, that seems like the food hadn't even left the restaurant and she was going to relay this message to the driver. I called back again after Yelp contacted them and was told 10-15 more minutes and still did not receive anything. They offered to discount an order of pot stickers for next time as a way to say sorry but we declined since we will never be ordering or eating from them again. The food was bad - I've had MUCH better Chinese food from other places. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Forced into a delivery dinner, Big Wa was the choice, but it ended up being a poor choice. The only good item was the Vegetable Fried Rice, which did contain frozen peas and carrots, but also enough fresh veggies to overcome that issue. The two free egg rolls that came with the order of 20 bucks were run of the mill with the usual orange dipping sauce. Heading downhill from there was the Chicken Noodle soup, featuring overcooked spaghetti noodles and strange pieces of chicken floating around. The poor chicken quality also showed up in a dish that i usually never order - the Moo Shu Chicken. Haven't had this in awhile, but the chicken is usually chopped up and mixed in with the veggies so you can put it in the pancakes. This chicken was the same from the soup, but sliced like it was a normal entree, so that created more of a burrito when you stuffed the pancakes full of items. Either way, the Moo Shu ingregients were inferior and Big Wa is not a top of the line place unless you like rice for dinner in this case."}
{"text":"I have lived from Montreal to Miami, and this is the best value for your money , tastiest food, quickest delivery, and most polite Staff.
I just moved to TEMPE, and was looking for Chinese delivery, tried Mr Hunan, gross, tried Szechuan, closed..
This came up on SIRI,..
I have tried Shrimp w Broccolli Amazing, Fresh, and ate 3xs, and I have a big boy appetitite, the Wonton Soup, Amazing,.. and the Crab Rangoon, the Largest and tastiest ever, the delivery guy even bowed to me, after exchanging cash for food....
I am so impressed, they are now my go to for Express Chinese Takeout.."}
{"text":"Food got to me 40 minutes past the 45-60 minute window, no call no apology. No sweet and sour or spicy mustard for a delivery that includes a pu pu plater, normally standard. The food is decent and some how still hot but I'm extremely put off by the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice is sooooo good and the shrimp are HUGE!!! Trust me the low reviews don't do this place ANY justice none what so ever...."}
{"text":"Lo mein was flavorless and drenched in oil. Food here is disappointing. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the Chandler restaurant when it was still in business and were thrilled to find a new one in Tempe.  The food was the same great flavors we loved.  The sauces were great.  The vegetables quite fresh.  The service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Large portions.  Fast and convenient.  Much better on the carry out as the inside needs some updating and cleaning.  Great if you want something quick."}
{"text":"I would leave a zero star review if I could! We are staying at the Holiday Inn Express on University and this place supposedly delivers here.  We found them online and placed our order there as well.  They estimated 50 minutes for delivery.  After 1 hour & 15 minutes I called to check the status.  NO ONE ANSWERED ANY OF THE PHONE NUMBERS we could find for them.  Double checked the numbers with the hotel & they tried calling as well.  No answer and their voicemail is not set up.  I even got the confirmation email that my order was received with an estimated delivery time.  If our food actually ever shows up we'll refuse it.  We ordered pizza instead!  If you're going to be closed, at least shut down your website so you can't take orders!! Ridiculous!  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Went during my lunch and wasn't too impressed by the food. I ordered the Ma La seafood under the chef's specialty and it definitely was spicy like it said on the menu. The shrimp tasted off to me though, like grassy or soil like. Service was good and there wasn't a long wait though."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials - huge portions, low prices. Very tasty sesame chicken. I got my food to-go but I liked the restaurant itself, it would be a nice place to sit down and eat. Friendly employees."}
{"text":"Great food always. Lo me in noodles, soups, house fried rice, Hunan chicken always great. All of their employees are always so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Fast delivery, generous portions, fresh food, polite delivery guy and Delicious crab puffs.  Definitely my new go-to Chinese Delivery."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the freshness and quality with our delivery..
Food arrived pretty quickly, piping hot.
ordering online was a breeze.
Impressed with portion sizes for the price. 
Defenitely will be ordering again, excited to have found a quality Chinese restaurant in our area and with delivery, Bonus!!
Only thing i may request next time is less spice, both the kung pao, and Mongolian triple dinners were a lil spicy but just a touch over almost perfect !!"}
{"text":"The food is fine but they messed up my order which is incredibly irritating with delivery. Ordered 2 special combinations (should have crab puff, egg roll, fried rice). All I received was meat + white rice. Huge waste of time and money. I would've eaten somewhere better & closer if all I was getting was nasty white rice. Get delivery somewhere else.

Update: I always appreciate a business responding. Food is definitely good here, we were pleasantly surprised. HOWEVER, do NOT order from Amazon Restaurants with them. When you click \"special combination\" it shows them entree. Until they change that, you won't ever get what you order. Please fix this!!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, large portions and delicious flavors. I recommend the combo fried rice and spicy orange chicken"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out from BIG WA, my husband and I really liked the food. My favorite was the Orange Chicken. Everything was fresh & hot. We will definitely be ordering food here again"}
{"text":"Got hungry before going out on the town. So my sister and I ordered delivery. The delivery guy was such a sweetheart. He was so pleasant. The food was still hot when we started eating. It was beautiful and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"This is my #1 go-to for any and all Chinese food!!!! I order at least 1x a week!!!!! This place has my heart! The pot sticker and sauce is my downfall and the orange chicken has a kick of spice that leaves me salivating for me! Keep up the good work and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Being of Chinese descent and growing up in family run restaurants, I know Chinese food.  There is a place for all types of Chinese food including fast food places like Big Wa.  The secret however, is that if you are a generic, run of the mill, sub par Chinese food restaurant, you need to compensate by having exceptional service and fast delivery.  This place fails on all counts.
 
This story starts all the way back in 2012. Going to the Mills one day to do some shopping is what introduced me to this place.  An employee of Big Wa was passing out menu's to people passing by and I grabbed one.  I work 5 minutes away in a call center and was organizing a company party and thought I would give them a shot to cater our event.  I let them know our budget, told them what I wanted, and everything was fine with the exception of one thing.  They were 20 minutes late. 
 
After having a decent experience the last time, I decide to use Big Wa again for our party this year.  I order what I want and negotiate the price.  The original quote was over our budget, but took a few things off in order to stay within.  My main stress points were that there needs to be enough food for 25 people, and that they NEED to be on time.  Everything was agreed upon the day before and I advised them I would call in the AM to confirm.
 
On the day of our luncheon, I contact Big Wa at 11:00am to ensure everything was on target for noon.  They assured me everything was great, and that if I wanted, they can be here at 11:30am.  I had no problems with that as I would inform my employees to break earlier.  I stress once again, that punctuality is important.  11:28am rolls around, and I receive a call to let inform me that they are going to be LATE.  I remain calm and ask for a realistic time frame and informed 15-20 minutes.  12:00pm rolls around (the time they were supposed to be here) and they only bring in half of the order.  In a big rush he drops off the food, and tells me he will be right back w/ the other half.  15 minutes now pass and he comes in w/ the other half.  There is enough food to feed 25 people, because they gave us extra white rice and noodles, and nowhere near enough for everyone to have a little of everything including the entrees. There were no serving utensils, not enough plates, and the food was of course, far from exceptional. 
 
I of course, call back to complain.  They offer no apologies and played dumb, so I proceeded to speak to them like they were idiots."}
{"text":"Everything we've had here is amazing. The wonton soup is great, egg rolls, walnut shrimp, Teriaki chicken, noodles, crab puffs.... all hot, fresh and delicious. When I've had Big Wa delivered, the delivery person bows as he gives me the food. Nice, respectful and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I was debating on what to eat and decided to come here. Ordered the honey chicken for lunch and thought it was alright. The customer service was good and even offered water for me waiting. The vibe of the restaurant seems quiet and nice. I think the place is worth a try to those craving some chinese."}
{"text":"Tasty food, and quick delivery! We received our delivery within 35 minutes of ordering, which was very impressive! Large portions for a very reasonable price! We'll definitely get several meals from this order. I'll definitely order from here again!

We liked the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and plain fried rice. My favorite part was probably the vegetable rolls! Seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their lunch menu of specials is huge. Each lunch selection includes a soup, egg roll and white or fried rice. Lunch at $5.95 a plate is a ton of food! The ambience is nice and quiet and the dining room very clean with an open floor plan. Service can be slow so if your looking to hurry on a Friday lunch hour this might not be your place."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and prices! Whether it's takeout, delivery, or dine in it's always great. The quality is consistent and it's always fast. Everyone is polite and my order is always made correctly. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal, especially wheen it comes to preparation and delivery. The food is always good and the delivery is prompt. I especially enjoy the gentleman who delivers the food, he always has a smile and extremely courteous."}
{"text":"\"WARNING PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY\"

This food, if that is what you wish to describe it ,is a gastronomical nightmare. If you don't first catch salmonella and other amoebas from the under-cooked chicken, then the ensuing heart attack from the level of grease that is used will surely do you in. I've changed oil with less. I couldn't discern what cesspool that the shrimp had floated in before they hit the plate but it was nothing I had experienced before and hope to God I never will.

I called them with my concerns and was advised that they don't do refunds. But they will reimbursed me fully ONLY IF I provided them with a doctor's note.This place must be in cahoots with one of those urgent care facilities. Somebody must be getting paid.

I WISH LERNER AND ROWE WENT AFTER THIS RESTAURANT. I NEED A CHECK!"}
{"text":"Delicious food great spacious environment and service was the best! The shrimp is amazing and the portions are enough to feed 2 for the already cheap price of one :)"}
{"text":"Th food is so AMAZING, so fresh, big portions and very reasonable prices. I hardly ate Chinese out here in Phoenix since I moved because I feel like it's all pretty nasty.This place just reminded me why Chinese is one of my favorite cuisines. Someone ordered from them at my job and the huge size is what caught my attention but the flavor and quality is what keeps me going back almost weekly."}
{"text":"My go to cheap Chinese joint. It's close to work and I can get out of there for under $10. Their wonton soup is excellent! It has all sort of veggies in it.

I normally get the lunch special Szechuan Chicken with fried rice and an egg roll with the soup."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Tempe Chinese delivery disappointments which makes this place even more exciting.  My husband and I have been ordering delivery from Big Wa for a few months now.  It is the best Chinese delivery this side of Tempe for sure.  They are quick!  Tonight they warned it would be an hour+ wait for the food and it was here in 45 minutes.  Most nights it only takes 30 minutes or so.  The fried rice comes in huge proportions -- we prefer it with pork.  Super tasty Kung Pao Chicken.  It's all good.  Five stars for nice staff (the people who take orders and deliver are always really nice and polite) and dependable/yummy/satisfying food.  Big Wa will not let you down!

PS: They give you free egg rolls if you spend more than $20."}
{"text":"Great lunch prices with nice portions.  Two of us ate lunch for $14 with Tip.  Food was good quality as well."}
{"text":"You guys!!  This place is amazing!  I flew in from Dallas and with not much around ordered from Big Wa Chinese delivery, I am so glad I did because it was perfection!  I ordered the orange chicken special that comes with fried rice, an egg roll, and a crab Rangoon. I was a little nervous ordering delivery because sometimes it can get to you and be soggy. Not this orange chicken, it was fried to the utmost crispy and crunchy texture - spicy with a hint of sweetness. The fried rice was excellent - it doesn't come with vegetables in it, it's browned rice with egg. Honestly I'm glad it lacking the veggies I think it would take away from orange sauce. I also love that the crab Rangoon has green onion in it. It gives it this extra savory flavor...can I order and have it delivered to TX on a weekly basis?!  
Definitely try this place out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"I don't know why there was a name change or why this place was empty when I visited during prime dinner hours. I can tell you that everything I ate was hot, fresh, appealing, and actually made me want to order another meal to go so I could experience it again at home.  This place should not be passed up.  It will become one of your favorites.  
The portions are good value for the money.  The simple things are not laking focus.  My won ton soup was one of the best that i've had in the Valley.  There could be something done about the atmosphere, but if you have a group, this is a great place to bring the team to eat!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, and unfortunately, it'll be the last. We walked in, wasn't greeted, we sat down at an empty table, about 2 mins later, the girl came and placed the menus on the table and said \"what do you want to drink?\" No hi, hello, or anything. We received our drinks, and she took our orders. The food came out quickly. Portions were definitely generous. Flavors were amazing! The food was real delicious. The establishment isn't clean, bathrooms are disgusting. The cups we were drinking out of were so dirty. It had build up and encrusted things on the cups. 

Even though the food was so good, everything else took over."}
{"text":"Eaten there twice now.  The General Chicken was ok.  Round balls fried with sauce.  Sauce was ok but plentiful.  Yesterday I had the Mongolian Beef and it was really really good.  Lots and lots of flavor, well cooked, and not too chewy."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the restaurant many times and the food is very good for the most part. Today's service forces me to lower my opinion of the place. I was on my lunch break and had a limited amount of time. I ordered egg foo young. It's was as though they forgot me. I wound up having to get it to go. No apologies offered. NOT GOOD."}
{"text":"Very friendly service good value and taste. If your looking for your family run chinese restaraunt that's not charging you an arm and a leg and giving you good food this should be your new spot."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. I'm very happy. I got the Mongolian beef off of the lunch menu. It came with a bowl of soup, a bit of egg fried rice and a small egg roll. The Mongolian beef was a tiny bit spicy, but since I'm a baby about spice this just means it had flavor. It was delicious. All that food and some hot tea for less than $7 is a win for me every time. I'll be back for lunch again for sure."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Big Wa twice now & love it! I don't normally eat a lot of Chinese food but, from now on I will be eating it at Big Wa. The portions are a great size for the price & the price is right. My kids were even happy with their food. They did a great job accommodating our large party as well! Great job Big Wa!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it was my first time ordering from here so I went with the sweet and sour chicken. Food arrived Hot and I like the fact that they put the sauce on the side so the chicken didn't get soggy. The driver was also very nice. Will order again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's clean, the staff is friendly, the food came out incredibly quick. We got the teriyaki chicken, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef and hot/sour soup. All had its own taste and it was flat out amazing. For those three dishes, 4 bowls of soup and 3 drinks it was $30. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love their hot and sour soup and so I order from here regularly.  I decided to get the Mongolian beef today to try something different. NEVER EVER doing that again. 90% onion and 10% beef. I'm pretty sure I ordered Mongolian beef and not Mongolian onion. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My food was great.  I ordred the Pu Pu platter and the Chicken Lo Mein lunch special.  The chicken in my main dish was tender, not rubbery and so full of flavor.  The portions were big.  I was very happy with my food.  The server did tell me that shrimp were out of season and the shrimp in the pu pu platter might taste kind of river-like and he was right, they were gross.  Other than that it was great.  I would have given them five stars had it not been for the river tasting shrimp but hey, he did warn me and I have to say the customer service was great.  The place was clean.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and delivery time was reasonable. We called 5 minutes before closing and they graciously took my order."}
{"text":"I only decided to order from here because I've made a couple pick ups from a food delivery app to others. So I just assumed it was good. I ordered for delivery two entrées with rice and crab puffs with a special note to add real hot mustard and sweet-and-sour to dip them into. The order showed up in a timely manner but they forgot the mustard and sweet-and-sour. I also found it interesting that they added the sauce to the orange pork which made it soggy. I called the restaurant and spoke with a female and she was less than apologetic but provided many excuses on why they had not included the sauces. She then said she'll get me a partial credit. Then she did not say anything else and hung up the phone. I called back letting her know that we must of gotten disconnected, she said with an annoying tone in her voice I said I would give you a partial credit and hung up the phone. I then called the delivery service so they could check to make sure she actually did give me the credit. It had been 10 minutes and she never did. I do not recommend this place at all because I can usually excuse incomplete orders if there's excellent customer service but in this case both were substandard."}
