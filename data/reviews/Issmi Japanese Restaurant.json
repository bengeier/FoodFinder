{"text":"Wide selection of fresh, high quality fish, beautiful presentation, reasonable prices, friendly staff.  Their cooked dinner was not as flavourful as it could have been and the meat was on the dry side.  Would return for Sushi/Sashimi."}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint. The service is great and the quality of food is unbelievable. The presentation is beautiful...I could go on.. I could eat at here 3 times a day everyday."}
{"text":"So fresh and so good! The fish is fresh and the rice portions are perfect, not too much not too little. Especially love the little touches of sauce and toppings on the nigiri. Service is good, the staff is very friendly. This is now my go to for delicious sushi in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the FTR! This place is my family's go to local sushi and Japanese restaurant. They deliver to our home near Yonge and York Mills and the prices are reasonable considering the high quality and freshness.  I've eaten in a number of times and service is always friendly and quick. Last night we ordered delivery and although it took a bit longer than my dad was quoted it was hot and fresh when it arrived. We had a selection of sashimi, my fav the spicy tuna roll and some chicken terriyaki and gyoza. Everything was great, I really enjoy their gyoza. The chicken was really juicy and nicely grilled.  All in all, solid Japanese in my hood."}
{"text":"I think this place is very good. The service is very good and the food also. It is cheaper than some big brands like spring rolls and yet it has good taste. I have been here 3 times and I can eat here more!"}
{"text":"Issmi is truly North York's hidden gem.   If I can't have Issmi, I won't have Japanese cuisine anywhere else. Seriously.  The food is always fresh and the ingredients are always of high quality."}
{"text":"Best sushi on toronto!! So fresh and so good.  Everyday sushi~~ i love issmi!! Was delicious Our server was so helpful and actually genuinely helped us pick what to eat. She was on point with her recommendations."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering from Issmi and all was delicious!! Thoroughly enjoyed the Kalbi BBQ Short Ribs and the Sashimi and Tempura Bento. So fresh and so flavourful. Portions were very generous. Will become our go-to sushi spot. Very, very impressed!!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place get more love?   Tried here based on all the positive reviews and have to totally agree. The food was delicious!  I tried their blazing roll which was presented with a real burning flame. The roll consisted of seared white tuna, spicy scallop, avocado and tobiko. The roll was full of flavour and didn't require any soy sauce or wasabi but it helped as well!  I also went with my standard California roll and really enjoyed these too. The rice they use for their rolls is different. I'm not sure how to describe it but it's very light.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We went as a family for a weekday lunch and it was excellent! The sushi quality was very good and the salad and miso soup were spot on! The kids (9 and 6) ordered mini bentos but it was still a ton of food for them. I ordered a tempura and sushi bento and was very full. My husband got the sashimi lunch and raved about the fish. Altogether, it was $46+tip which is pretty reasonable for a sushi meal.   I would definitely go back for their lunch menu. The dinner prices seem a bit on the high side but I can't say whether it's worth it or not.   Service was good. Our waiter was friendly and checked in on us a couple of times and refilled our water and tea. They freeze little lemon pieces into the ice cubes so your water is flavoured as they melt... A very nice touch!  I would definitely recommend Issmi"}
