{"text":"It's a rare trip for us to go east of Yonge for a restaurant but this gem at Parliament and Queen was more than worth it. Our niece from out of town picked it because she was looking for an African resto here and we needed a place to help us with our \"Eating our way through the atlas\" project.   Our appetizer, kele wele (Ghanaian street food) or fried plantains, was delicious. Done to a lovely softness with a touch of spice and a hint of peanut, a heavenly start to the meal. One order was a perfect starter for two adults and a preteen girl. My goat nyama choma was nicely done, striking a perfect balance between seasoning and natural flavour of the meat (that is to say, it wasn't overly spiced nor overpowering 'goat-y'). If you've never had goat this is a perfect introduction. The chicken Suva was wonderful nicely grilled with a little bit of heat, and the efo irio (spinach beef stew) was a spicier dish full of flavour and served with a good sized dumpling-like item made with yam flour.   Try the puff puff for dessert, a little heavy but a wonderful way to finish the meal.   One appetizer, three entrees, a couple of sides, two desserts, a glass of wine and one soft drink came in just over a hundred bucks, a pretty reasonable price for three in downtown Toronto.   Do I recommend this place? Hell, yeah!"}
{"text":"just walked by the place and wondered in. loved the kushary. My first time trying African cuisine. will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Servers at restaurant are rude and not friendly. We asked if we could sit and basically this girl with braid goes \"yeah whatever\" like what kind of answer is that ? Also after we sat we got ignored literally nobody bothered to come ask us if we are ready to order. We left and joined part upstairs but maybe it's good we didn't eat from here. Their jollof looks dry"}
{"text":"To say I loved this place is an understatement. When this place originally opened I was so excited to give it a try, mainly because my grandmother is from Cameroon and my grandfather from Senegal. So I grew up on some good african food with southern twists. So it's been over 10 years since I've had African food. Not to mention, we saw a Groupon for this place so we scooped that and made our way down on Sunday. We booked reservations through yelp and found it easy, no hiccups.   We were seated right by the window and I loved it, people watching is always fun. Our server Savannah, was extremely friendly! I loved the service and if your in a rush to eat and leave, this is not the place for you. We ordered the Kele Wele, beef suya with jollof rice, West african Red stew with chicken and to end the night off with some good ol' puff puffs. The food was incredibly flavourful. Each bite brought me back home with my grandfather in the kitchen. It was so delicious although I wish it was a little more spicy. I asked for medium and it barely had any spice. Next time, I'll order the Kiza fire sauce to spice some things up. My husband loved his dish, the beef suya was good and the jollof was good. I ended up stealing some bites and it was pretty delicious. Again, reminded me of some back home goodness. We had so much food at the end of the night, we basically had to roll ourselves back to the car.   There was a bonus for our visit, they were on the second week of doing Afrofest auditions. So we got to take in some free entertainment and it just topped the night off. Some alright music but the one girl, Gabrielle I believe? Had amazing spoken word! Heads up as well, the second floor turns into a lounge for the people that want to live it up a bit more. If your still reading this review and undecided, I'm letting you know- try this place, right now."}
{"text":"The sounds of Africa greeted and the food did not disappoint.  They would have had 5 stars if the service was more prompt.  We enjoyed the okra stew and pounded yam, grilled tilapia and jollof rice, pepper soup, fruit salad, and  puff puff.  The maitre d' did a great job of educating us about the menu items.  Worth a return visit for great flavours and relaxing ambiance."}
{"text":"Kiza restaurant serves up a variety of African dishes (big servings too) at very reasonable prices. The restaurant is located on the east side of downtown which makes it a little bit of a trek but its a unique gem considering the African food offering in Toronto.  I found all the dishes very distinct - I tried: Pepper Soup w Tilapia - I asked for this medium spicy but this was still VERY spicy. Recommend going with Mild. Soup is basically a watery base with chunks of whatever meat you choose. The spice is unique but it was too hot.  Kele Wele - fried plantain. Not oily, and not too crispy. Really delicious and would recommend trying as an appetizer!  Yassa Chicken - The chicken is served with essentially two small servings of rice. The dish is pretty strong in taste being more tangy so I recommend a dry dish to compliment.  Beef Suya - essentially thin strips that are dried. There was some powder you can dip in if you want some additional spice. Quite chewy and a nice compliment to the other dishes we tried.  Overall, friendly service, and a pleasant experience trying some unique tastes from all over Africa. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a new unique tasting adventure!"}
{"text":"I went to Kiza Friday night to celebrate my mums birthday. Kiza is a pan-african restaurant with dishes that come from all over africa. I feel a yad conflicted about my review so I will break it down into pros and cons.  Pros  I really liked the ambiance. It is two floors. The first floor is the restuarant and upstairs becomes a nightclub. The vibe is very laid back you feel like you are a guest in someones home. The seating is very comfortable and have a stage for live performances.  The food was impressive. I had the peri peri shrimp, which was amazing. The shrimp had a grilled flavourvbut it wasn't over cooked and it was tossed in the best peri peri sauce I've ever had. I also had the pepper soup with goat (be careful if you don't like spice because it is spicy). The goat was so tender and the flavour was perfect. I could drink that daily. I actually want the recipe. My friend orderes the talapia I thought talapia shlapia it's a pretty boring fish but they really transformed it. It had a really rich colour, simmered in a tasty tomato based sauce, served with jollof rice. Spectacular! I have a friend who is a picky eater and opted for the kiza wings and fried rice. She loved it so much she didn't offer to share. All I can say is it smelled good and I'm curious. I ordered the oxtail. I was a bit disappointed. Although it was the most tender oxtail I've ever ordered I found the flavour a bit bland more along the lines of an Irish stew. That beefy flavour with carrot and potatoes. I added the kiza hot sauce to it and it was better but I wouldn't order it again. It also only came with 4 oxtails. I think they have better options on the menu. My mom had the lamb tangine which was again extremely tender. It was served with light and fluffy couscous. Although it was really good it wasn't amazing.  For dessert we wanted to try the puff puff but I think they were sold out so they offered a complimentary fruit salad.  I made the mistake of assuming the fruit salad would be underwhleming but it WAS NOT! I really need to stop assuming. It was a mix of finely chopoed topical fruits and fresh herbs. It was a nice palate cleanser after all of the savoury dshes. Perfect ending to the meal.  Cons:  -Booking the reservation was a tad difficult. I called multiple times and got no answer during operrating hours and the voicemail was full. I used the booking option online and no one followed up within a couple of days. So I used the messsenger option online and finaly got a reservation.  -My waitress was really friendly but absent. We constantly had to call her over for drinks, napkins, additional cutlery, hot sauce, to order dessert, to order coffee, to order the appetizers and the main. There was no anticipation of the guest needs, no upselling, no checking up. She was very nice and answered all our questions but we always had to call her over or we just asked other waitors for drinks, etc.   I took one star off for the service but I would definitely come back."}
