{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend, and not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted to order mac and cheese at 10:30 a.m.! We ended up getting more traditional brunch items. The eggs en sugo were perfectly cooked in a delicious tomato sauce, and toasty bread. My brunch buddy loved her French toast. Cappuccino was on point. We loved the yummy food, and great, friendly service! Cute neighbourhood place. You know a place is great when even the non-specialty dishes are awesome! I can't wait to come back to try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"This spot has come up with some incredible Mac and Cheese creations. It's comfort food and good quality ingredients all served up in a warm gooey dish. Some tasty local craft beers are available in the fridge too, making this a go-to spot for some indulgent cravings. Great work Chef Boris!"}
{"text":"I generally only bother writing reviews on restaurants where I decide to give it 5 stars and here we are. So why Mac-A-Tak? Because the owner, Boris, who I spoke with and was doing the cooking puts effort into the taste of each ingredient, combines flavors well, and he just knows how to cook. I actually came here on a whim to try the breakfast based on the reviews, and was stunned by the French Toast.  We've eaten a lot of french toast around the city and honestly this is the best I've had. Browned on an iron skillet and baked to perfection. Slightly crisp on the outside, soft fluffy centre on thick challah bread. Eggs Benny was great as well. So of course I had to come back to try their Mac and Cheese. Was not surprised that it was really a great mac and cheese with tasty toppings. If you are a mac and cheese fan (which actually I'm not) you will really enjoy it. Now I should mention for those expecting their best meal ever because of the great reviews here - come on, it's still mac and cheese. That's actually why I know this guy can cook. It's like watching the Iron Chef, and the secret ingredient they give them to make their mains is............the lowly macaroni.  Well, they've figured out how to make some really really great dishes with it.  For me, I'm craving their french toast again!"}
{"text":"I don't really know any other place in the GTA that specializes in mac and cheese. You're seriously missing out if you have a dairy allergy!  Mac-A-Tak still has some items from their previous business, Scratch Kitchen - ie. the enormous fluffy pancakes and creative egg bennys. Now they have a whole new section in the menu for mac and cheese lovers.   You can either customize the mac and cheese to your preference, or there are pre-made ones. I opted for the one with three giant meatballs and just a precaution, this is way too much food for one person! I had to pack half of it to go. The meatballs were filled with cheese and the macaroni was cooked to perfection (not soggy, just the perfect texture).   Service has always been pleasant and you can park on the side streets for free, or by Loblaws (if you spend $20 in groceries).   So... if you ever get a mac and cheese craving, you know where to go!"}
{"text":"We came, we ate, and then we had our party catered by Boris,. It was amazing, and the response from our guests made us feel great about the food.  Boris created the menu, (which had to be mindful of numerous allergies and some other dietary restrictions).  Kudos Boris.   You've shown that Mac and cheese has a new and higher standard, and the tarts and dips were delicious.     The quantities were perfect, and leftovers were enjoyed as well. Having  your server made our party great.  We could enjoy it and know that everything was going great. The cost was reasonable and competitive.  Thanks Boris"}
{"text":"Was craving comfort food and this place did not disappoint.  We tried the the Banquet Mac n cheese and it was huge and amazing.  So creamy (replaced the cheddar with Monterey Jack cheese), lots of bacon and ground beef.   It was enough to feed 3 people.  Then  we ordered the fried mac n cheese balls and the cheese stuffed meatballs.  They were only $2 each (wowzers).  The meatballs were unbelievable (the marinara sauce was exquisite), Mac n cheese balls were good as well with the homemade hot sauce.  On top of that they have Flying Monkey beer on tap for 6 bucks.  All in all, this place is a definite recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely the best mac and cheese I've ever had! I had the one topped with beef brisket... we shared one portion between 2 people and barely made a dent! It tasted great the next day as leftovers too. Super fun place to eat and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The place came highly recommended from a friend of mine and I had to visit.  Right next to the loblaws on Yonge street between York Mills and Lawrence- in case you need parking is Mac-A-Tak , seems like a fairly new establishment as the owner advised us. He said this used to be a italian restaurant with a very popular brunch service but the area was saturated with that market, so he opted to go for a dish that is not as common.  Boy was he right, this mac and cheese was unlike any I had before. Gigantic servings that could easily feed 2 topped with meat of your choice and other toppings. Was creamy, gooey and delicious. I couldn't finish my portion but maybe the mac n cheese meatball I tried as an appetizer had something to do with it. It was ginormous and a pleasure to break thru.  The server was friendly- i remember her saying she just moved from Vancouver. Overall- the way the staff handled themselves was way above par. As it was beyond customer service- we chatted it up like we knew each other for years. Natural conversations with a home like feeling. Really refreshing- every aspect of this experience was new and I am looking forward to try out the different variations of mac and cheese this place has to offer.  I opted to get the rasta pasta- which is jerk chicken (shredded) on top of baked macaroni and the cheesiest of cheese. I believe there was a pineapple mango sort of garnish to compliment it and also fresh deep fried plantain. Amazing- i am eating the leftovers this morning while writing this review.   So Good!"}
{"text":"Foodora came through with lunch today and was happy Chris our delivery person  understood delivery instructions .. my brother and I had mac n cheese with lamb shank and he got the ground beef .. lamb was a little greasy which is normal and was very good .. the portions were huge the equivalent of at least two meals .. this place will not leave you wanting more ..   I especially liked the choices of vegetable toppings .. I had mushrooms corn and roasted peppers .. disappointed that no napkins or utensils provided even though they were requested"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 10/10 Drink: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Value: 10/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  WOW! Passed by this place many times with the intention to come by at least once. Came to this place with some of the Mac and cheese in mind and was definitely not left wanting anything but. They did an amazing job.   I got the drunken cowboy Mac & Cheese. The cheese blend was perfect to give the it the creamy and stringy textures. The flavours were bold and flavourful. The BBQ sauce and the brisket were excellent. It reminds me of true southern comfort food. I haven't had soul food this good outside of the deep South  (Georgia) in a looooong time. It came served in a hot cast iron bowl.  The strawberry smoothie was perfectly blended and was refreshing.   Service was extremely friendly and prompt. Excellent!  Price seems a little high for just Mac and cheese but you'll definitely have more than enough leftovers for the next day and the ingredients are top notch. You're definitely getting what you pay for.   They have a lot of cool self-made art pieces lining the wall. The kitchen is open, so you can see everything that goes on.   Definitely recommend this place. If you come here come hungry. The portions are huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am impressed!  I was really impressed with their mac and cheese. The portions are really filling - staff were definitely upfront about that and even told me I didn't have to order 4 portions for 4 people, that 2 would be sufficient. He was definitely right. Between 2 adults and two kids, we barely finished one portion.  We ordered the Original and the Tree Hugger (broccoli and alfalfa sprouts). They both tasted great.  Prices are excellent considering the portion sizes. Staff were kind and professional.  There's something addictive about this place. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other Mac and cheese varieties."}
{"text":"Would recommend this cozy place for weekend brunch. Went here with a group of 6 adults and a toddler.  We tried their bennys, grilled cheese, pancake and brunch Mac and cheese as well as the truffle mac and cheese.  Everyone left with happy faces and full tummies. The meals aren't cheap but good value for the taste, quality and serving size. Good location."}
{"text":"Really good! An improvement on Skratch kitchen for sure. I liked everything we got. I wish I tried one of their grilled cheeses. The fries are a tad thin for my liking."}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant serving amazing mac & cheese dishes with a variety of gourmet toppings. Cozy at home atmosphere with attentive customer service. Great place to catch up with friends and family while satisfying your food cravings."}
{"text":"I went for Brunch and had the 3 egg Frittata omelette with caramelized onions and spinach, it was amazing. All my friends loved what they ordered, too. You must check this place out, must."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch with a few coworkers.  Place was very quiet at 12:30PM on a weekday.  No need to wait.  Solid service.  Nice clean environment.    Now the food.  The Funions are really good.  Get um to share.  Now for the mac and cheese.  You get a lot of saucy cheese, topped with more stretchy cheese.  I got the drunken cowboy, which had 3 slices of beef brisket with BBQ sauce.  I'd recommend something with a tangy sauce like the BBQ to balance out the richness of the cheese, cause there's A LOT of cheese.  It was nice to have something cut that grease coating in your mouth after each cheesy bite.  I personally would like the cheese to be a touch saltier.  The pasta was a little on the overcooked side.  It was quite pricey for what you're getting IMO.  Granted, it's definitely a heavy meal and you will leave full as hell and ready for an afternoon nap."}
