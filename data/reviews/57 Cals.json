{"text":"Had their shish taouk and shawarma sandwhich today and really enjoyed them. Wish there were more vegan places like this around."}
{"text":"We just ate in this restaurant and first of all, I have to say the the prices are pretty good. The Philly Burger is to die for, extremely good with the creamy melted vegan cheese and the fake meat. A bit on the oily side though but very tasty. One Philly was not enough though and I am happy my daughter could not finish her sandwich.
You need to order the mini falafels, they are quite inexpensive and you have plenty to satisfy your hunger. Their small serving of fries is gigantic!
On the bad side, there was a very long hair in my wife's sandwich. The owner were very nice and eventually gave us some desert at the end of the meal but I would recommend they were a hair covering in the future.
Don't hesitate to go there though, the food is good!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and staff! 
Tamar! You're the best =D! 

Modest little restaurant/takeout with no fancy decoration or anything like that, but I was greeted by Tamar who immediately made me feel super at home. Cuz I m no vegan guys......  She took the time to give me recommendations and walked me through the menu.

I went with a friend, so we settled on one shawarma sandwich , one shish taouk sandwich, a spicy bacon poutine and two Philly cheese sliders.
 *** Tamar had everything split in half in the kitchen before bringing it to us #majorprops**** 
The \"meat\" tasted and had the texture of meat. Everything was so fresh, well seasoned and tasty. The slider had that creamy texture from some sort avocado spread... basically it was DELICIIIIICIIIUUUUSSS! 

Ohhh and here a paragraph dedicated to the poutine : Da BOMB! Dont expect to find \"fromage en grain squeek-squeek\" laaa. But if you are looking for a special sauce that punches you with a little spiciness, some kind of middle eastern flavours and crispy fries, then this is a winning combinations that they came up with! 

Anyway, 
Food quality 5 
Staff and service 5 
Would I go again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"My #1 place in Laval for awesome falafel and other vegetarian goodies. I'm by no means a vegan nor a vegetarian nut, but when my body says, hey! enough meat for this week, the first place that comes to mind is 57 Cals. Everything I tried there was just very good.... even the spicy poutine to my surprise. Overall, a highly recommended on the go place when you're not feeling to eat any sort of meat that day. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Vegan Food at low prices ! I had looked up on Yelp local Vegan restaurants in Laval and there's 3 lol. But my son wanted a Vegan Poutine so we decided to check this place out. 

It's a tiny little restaurant but with an amazing menu full of Vegan options at very low prices. Like a vegan pita, coleslaw and fries for $6 ????? Unbelievable !!! 6 falafels for $3.00 amazing. 

As well they have an assorted platter for $25. It was too big for me and my son but maybe another time. Definitely looks like it's worth a try. 

Parking in the lot is free, they also do pickup orders. The service is extremely fast and wonderful too. I appreciated it and they were very friendly and nice. My son loved how much vegan cheese and gravy was on the Poutine."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Made with care, clean and fresh. Portions are interesting and quite filling. I tried the spicy falafel sandwich, it was awesome and spicy, the shistaouk sandwich sandwich was less my taste but good and finally I tried the spicy poutine and the sauce was delish!

Good place for take out or quick bite. They are more a catering business then a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Salsa sandwich and the Philly Burger were quite tasty. Full of flavor and most importantly, the texture was spot on! The Samosas were crispy and flaky.  My favorite was the Pita Patate- It's a amazing how something so simple can satisfy a craving. I was wanting something cheesy and gooey- This potato sandwich nailed it! 
We stopped in for carryout and I plan on using the delivery service soon."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Amazing food! Huge menu and all vegan! Philly Cheese Steak is my favorite, can't believe its not meat. From quesadillas to shawarma.. Rich with protein and low cals. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I'm so happy for vegan poutine! This is genius  we need this LA, ASAP!!! Loved the shish taouk spicy sandwiches.. Tasted like real chicken. Well done! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I won't give any additionnal star just because it's vegan. I rate the place 4/5 because the food tasted great and it was priced very good.

I tasted the shawarma and the steak philly. The shawarma was really good, the steak philly was delicious. The fries, were...Fried?(standard) the baklava was good. We also took half a dozen falafels. They were blend, but in a sandwich or with sauce/vegetable they could be amazing.

The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because there is no bathroom and that it's, after all, fast food.

For the record, the service is great! The lady at the counter was all smiles and very polite.

The fact it's vegan food is just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Every year my boyfriend and I throw a Christmas party in our tiny apartment. This year, for the first time we decided to cater the event. We tried 57 Cals's mini shawarma at a vegan festival and decided they were even better than the typical meat ones... so we figured we'd give the rest of the food a try. 

They showed up on time to our party, with six huge platters, beautifully arranged. Our some 30 guests absolutely loved all the food. Mini Shawarmas, mini shish taouks, Philadelphia cheese steak sliders and falafel burgers. Everything vegan. They all had delicious sauces making the food truly unique. 

My least favourite platter was probably the samosas. The doe was different, not as moist and crispy as the typical indian samosa. Still, by the end of the night there wasn't even a crumb left over."}
{"text":"Really good vegan food! Whenever im close i always try to go, try their wraps, burgers and poutines you wont be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan place in Laval! So yummy!

I had the shish taouk sandwich and fries, and they were great!

One problem, the fries were a bit overcooked and felt like cement.

The sandwiches are definitely worth it!

Go try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently, I ordered from 57 Cals which consisted of  a pair of Vegetarian Shish Taouk (chicken tempeh) pitas and they were pretty good! The delivery was quick and friendly. The cost was pretty low for pretty much great value.

The pitas were packed with content and were fresh and tasty! Would order from here again!

I ordered from here again and the quality of the grub was not the same...

Ordered a 3rd time and it was mediocre. The chicken pita was all soggy..."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan person, but we had to go here because one of us was vegan and it was closest diner in the area. The poutine sauce was really weird. I can handle the cheese because i tried a vegan poutine at La Banquise and it is way better. I also had an imitation of a Phillyburger. I dont know what they did but the fake beef and all the mixed ingredient felt a bit liquidy. 

The shawarma and shish taouk looked good thought, maybie i shouldve taken that instead. 

In the end, my vegan friend liked the place as for me, Lola Rosa would've been a better option."}
{"text":"If you miss going to Amir for their sharwama or shish taouk and you became vegan it is a good compromise. Except that it is not as healthy as you may think, fries on every meal."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious vegan food! Many options available. Friendly staff, good prices. 

Cons: not very eco conscious, they serve everything in disposable plates which is a shame really. Tha's the only reason I avoid eating there."}
{"text":"Grosssssss!!!!! I got a poutine and it made me sick to my stomach. I was excited to try the only vegan restaurant in Laval but ended up regretting it. The trip there was not worth it."}
{"text":"Si vous avez un craving pour de la cuisine du Moyen-Orient ou de l'Inde (falafel, shish taouk, samosa, etc.) mais ne désirez pas pour autant contribuer à la souffrance animale, 57Cals est fait pour vous! C'est sûr que ce n'est toutefois pas l'option la plus santé: après tout et, comme le nom du restaurant le suggère, un seul falafel compte pour 57 calories. ;)
Du sandwich philly à l'assiette shawarma en passant par le traditionnel hummus, il y a beaucoup de choix. Si vous venez pour la première fois, je vous suggère de commander le \"Plateau d'essai\". Il n'est pas sur le menu officiel mais comprend, pour seulement 20$, plusieurs saveurs différentes (sandwich traditionnel, sandwich philly, sandwich raffi, environ une douzaine de falafels et samosas). Parfait pour partager à deux!
Par contre, gardez en tête que l'endroit est davantage un comptoir à emporter qu'un \"vrai\" restaurant. Même s'il y a quelques places assises, ce n'est pas très chaleureux. On se rapproche beaucoup de l'ambiance d'un fast food \"classique\". Aussi, malheureusement, toutes les commandes (incluant celles qui sont destinées à être consommées sur place) viennent avec des assiettes et des ustensiles en plastique. On se retrouve donc avec beaucoup de déchets qui, pourtant, auraient pu être évités. J'ai failli retirer une étoile de la note et j'espère sincèrement que le restaurant réduira bientôt l'usage de contenants à usage unique. Le temps d'attente est souvent un peu long: si vous savez déjà ce que vous allez prendre, téléphonez 30 minutes avant votre arrivée pour ne pas trop patienter une fois que vous serez sur place.
Au final, si vous résidez à Laval, je vous recommande fortement de donner une chance à 57Cals. Par contre, si vous habitez à Montréal et que vous avez envie de manger sur place, le restaurant n'en vaut pas vraiment le détour. Surtout que, si vous voulez essayer leurs plats, ils sont désormais offerts à Herbivores (nouvelle épicerie végane sur Saint-Denis)!"}
{"text":"Tried this because it was the only vegan option near the place we were going. We got 2 sampler cause we didn't knew what to get. The sampler was excellent choice to tried the different flavor they offer. From the sampler we didn't like the philly steak not the wrap which resemble the same type of mushroom. The falafel were excellent. Two of the eater were not vegan and it was their first time trying this type of food and they like it."}
{"text":"Try the SHAWARMA sandwich. Its like that Libanaise Restaurant \"Amir\" but all Vegan."}
{"text":"Repas santé et à bon prix. Bonne et belle imitation de viande.

Par contre, le goût est monotone à la longue. Troisième fois que j'essaie et certainement la dernière.

Resto style comptoir-service de petite taille, situé dans un bloc de boutiques, banques et autres restaurants sur Curé-Labelle."}
{"text":"Lebanese style vegan food and tastes like the original recipes with meat! I took the platter to share and liked everything I ate.  The platter was 25$ and is enough for 2 big eaters.  We had left overs to take home. About $13 each and totally worth it.  They have a few dipping sauces and some deserts as well! The food is fresh too. Its a very small restaurant with about 5 tables. Perfect to grab a quick bite."}
