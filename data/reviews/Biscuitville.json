{"text":"Great place for breakfast i often go and grab a biscuit or two, and save one for later.  Try a sausage and egg biscuit and add your hash brown side to it, its very good. The biscuits and platters are mostly good, the chicken is a bit bland so go for a sausage or bacon one."}
{"text":"Biscuits a LOT smaller and more dry than a place specializing in biscuits. Was disappointed"}
{"text":"Some of the friendliest folks around work here. A true Southern feel here. Food is made fresh. You can watch the lady rolling out fresh biscuits all day. My personal favorite is the ultimate bacon biscuit. And they serve breakfast late if you like to sleep in."}
{"text":"Ok this is by FAR my favorite find since moving to NC!!! This location is super clean and has a 99% rating from the board of health!! Hats the highest I've seen around here! Staff is super friendly and I go there so much that the guy knows my order!! Great place for breakfast but closes at 2pm so get there early!!"}
{"text":"Gimme some breakfast sandwiches on biscuits please! This is a breakfast place serving mainly - you guessed it, biscuits.  The biscuits here are pretty good. I wish they were a bit more moist, but it wasn't super super dry.  I got a breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg on a biscuit. I had wanted cheese also, but for some reason, they didn't put it on it. Oh well, I guess. The sandwich was good, and the hash brown it came with was golden and crispy.  Service is fast and friendly.  Oh, and they have a window where you can see a lady making some fresh biscuits. Pretty cool for little kids (or adults) who want to see their biscuits in action."}
{"text":"On my first visit at 12:30PM two weeks ago, it wasn't that busy. Today, at 10:30AM, it was busy as heck!  Husband had a chicken jalape√±o biscuit which was very good. I had a side of gravy (delicious, with a bit of spicy zing to it) and a sausage biscuit.  I'm def a fan of Biscuitville."}
{"text":"Biscuitville is our go-to for weekend breakfast out. The food tastes fresh and is of high quality, it's usually quick, and they get our order right.   We tried the strawberry muffin for the first time today and it is 10/10 amazing! Not sure if they are limited time or not but they are awesome.   They also usually offer biscuits shaped like dog bones when our dogs are with us which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"First ever visit. Perceived quality to be somewhere between McDonalds and IHOP, however - it was pretty much McDonalds, only it cost more. Too much like anywhere else fast food. Way too loud with the TV going. For the prices, you need to do more than just be fast food...  Having said that, I managed to order without getting a biscuit (kind of assumed for the price it was included), so I will try again to make sure I was this underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great as usual. I didn't recognize it with all the beautiful renovations. Food and service was great! Me and my sister dined in and it was very clean and you see the biscuits being made from scratch"}
{"text":"We were on the lookout for North Carolina food--biscuits sounded great. Did a search on Yelp! and found no Biscuitville nearby. But then I called Biscuitville directly to see if they had a location that was closer than the 30 miles shown. YES! A new one 5 miles away, and so here we are.  Great biscuits--perfect and fluffy yet a little crunchy on the outside.   I had a biscuit meal #3 I think: - sausage patty in a biscuit - grits with a 1/2\" layer of melted butter (I poured it off) - coffee that I sub'd for OJ   My friend had a biscuit breakfast sandwich that she enjoyed as well.   Delish!"}
{"text":"This place puts any fast food biscuit to shame. If you want a real buttermilk biscuit this is the place to come. Bo's biscuits are so greasy that the wrapper and bag are soaked. These are fresh biscuits and not frozen like Walter implied.  Also the \"big mustard bottle\" is not filled with syrup, Its filled with butter! The bologna egg and cheese is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Yes Yes and more Yes! This place is the bomb! Best cheap breakfast :) We usually come on Sunday mornings and the staff is ALWAYS friendly and the food is consistent! I haven't come across one situation or meal that was unsatisfactory.  So glad they are nearby :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service and just so friendly!   Always offers my dog a doggie biscuit which she loves!  Pancakes taste just like homemade and biscuits and muffins are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed how quick the drive thru was.  The food was excellent and great portion size.  This would do great in New England where it's hard to find a good biscuit."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the first time on Wednesday morning at about 9:30 . I ordered their special, two sausage biscuits and a cup of coffee. I also ordered two country ham biscuits to go, (for my wife at home). The coffe was good and that's about it. The sausage was paper thin and could have been used as shoe leather. The biscuits were heavy and very chewy. My wife did say that the country ham tasted OK alone. Her biscuits were the same as mine. To add, I asked the cashier/biscuit maker if the biscuits were fresh and she said that she made them from scratch herself.  VERY DISAPPOINTED !"}
{"text":"Due to the continuous raving my one crazy friend does about this place, we packed up the kids and drove 15 minutes to check it out.   I had been really craving some pimento cheese biscuit! But no. It wasn't good. The kind of pimento cheese you can buy near the hotdogs at the grocery store. No. The bacon was chewy. I personally hate that.   The gravy had zero flavor. My husband said the sausage was just okay.  The biscuits aren't terrible, but definitely not worth a drive.   Worst slices of cheese I have ever tasted.  Worse than government cheese.   For the price I won't be back. $3 for a bad biscuit...no. I'll stick to my nearby Bojangles and McDonalds. Both are WAY better."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to eat. Despite the low prices the biscuit sandwiches are a good size. Two are more than enough to fill you up.   I don't get why they are only open until 2 pm though. I feel like this would be a good late night food."}
{"text":"Pretty darn yummy, good prices, comfort food crossed with quick and easy service. The staff was super friendly as well. We will return."}
{"text":"Ok first experience at Biscuitville- it was Excellent!  I just had a plain biscuit with jelly - was so happy the biscuit was not greasy. Light Fluffy & Yummy not to mention every employee had a smile on their face and seem to be having a great time. My husband got the pork chop with egg & cheese - he loved it - way to go Biscuitville"}
{"text":"Here's how much I like Biscuitville.  Worked here for a summer...hated the job...but still love the biscuits.  I moved to the Midwest and had trouble explaining to people that it's a restaurant almost entirely of biscuits.  Puts McDonald's breakfast to shame."}
{"text":"So every review that I read about is about the biscuits because of course that's all they have right? Wrong!!! They have some amazing melt in your mouth pancakes that I would compare to Ihop. You know that these pancakes are fresh because you always have to wait for the cook to make them. I would recommend this restaurant on their pancakes alone."}
{"text":"Biscuitville is an interesting beast. Since most people clamor for their biscuits, it is not a terrible surprise that they are only open for breakfast/lunch hours - in other words, get there early (2pm?). Now with most places that serve breakfast, that means if you get there late, you simply don't get breakfast. With Biscuitville, you don't get fed. As in, the doors are closed, and you get nothing. So get there early.  This is not - really - a bad thing, as long as you know - and can follow - the rules. Just be aware.  When it comes to the menu, there are biscuits. You can even find dog biscuits on the counter most days (sometimes they are out), which is a nice treat to take home to your four-legged friend. Or, I suppose, you could buy them as a snack for yourself if you really like to count your pennies, since they are rather inexpensive.  Service is generally good, and while you wait, you can sometimes catch biscuits being made in the \"biscuit theater\" up front - but most times, it's just empty, which means they spent some money creating the space. Perhaps that is why they sell those dog biscuits.  When it comes to the food - it's not bad. The biscuits are good, but the fillings are generally so-so. The spicy honey biscuit? Though the chicken is decent, it is not spicy and there is not much honey. Oddly, even Bojangles have seemed to do away with spiciness lately. The grits are not particularly well-flavored (this is not unique to them, a lot of folks have problems with grits). The biscuits and gravy are not bad. Overall, they are a decent option if you get there early enough, but there are some better places out there."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Service was quick. The restaurant was very clean. Even though it's a chain it has a real \"local feel\" to it. Customers and staff all seemed to know one another."}
{"text":"So this is the ONLY Biscuitville in the Charlotte area and boy is it a gem! Drove out here after a serious hankering for Biscuitville. I've been fortunate enough to always live or work no more than 6 miles from the nearest Biscuitville in all my years in North Carolina. So imagine my dismay when I realized that the nearest one was in Indian Trial.   So after weeks of plotting and planning, I made the trek way out to Indian Trail in morning traffic to cure my hankering.   When I got there there were only 2 other cars in line so I already felt super lucky. When I got there the heavens opened (Or maybe the sun just came out from behind the clouds...) but either way there was a big, beautiful advertisement for their new spicy chicken and honey biscuit. They do a regular chicken biscuit well...I love spicy, I love honey and I've become a huge fan of the spicy-sweet combination. This my lovely Yelpers was a true foodie win-win. So I ordered the spicy chicken and honey biscuit combo with their home fries and a sweet tea.   The customer service was outstanding from the speaker to driving away from the window. The food was beyond perfect. Hot and fresh. The chicken was juicy and perfectly spiced and the honey was the perfect complement. The breading was crispy and formed a perfect envelope nestling the meaty goodness inside. The biscuit was the perfect texture. Fluffy and tender and flavorful and it gave the perfect bread to protein ratio. The fries were hot and fresh and doused in just the right amount of seasoned salt.   And of course the tea was North Carolina sweet--aka perfect sweetness.   I will definitely make the trek again soon!! Kudos to this location. You made my morning."}
{"text":"Great spot for a cheap breakfast.  Not usually crowded so it's a quick stop for morning commutes.      Food can be stale later in the day but piping hot and fresh in the morning!  Get the fries (more like tater wedges) rather than the hash brown, you get a ton of them and they are awesome."}
{"text":"Clean place and fast friendly service. Got the new sweet and spices chicken biscuit.  Very good!"}
{"text":"I first stumbled across Biscuitville many years ago in Greensboro.  Being a lover of biscuits, a restaurant specializing in them was right up my alley.  This location just opened within the last 12 months if I recall and it was busy when I stopped in on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant only serves breakfast and features (as the name implies) all sorts of proteins on a biscuit.  A sign on the window advertised a bologna, egg, and cheese biscuit.  I'm not a big fan of bologna, but I know it's somewhat popular in the south so I ordered it in a meal with wedge fries and a drink.  There was a bit of a line and only one single register, so it took a few minutes before I was able to order.  After ordering I took my seat to wait for my number.  I waited maybe five minutes for my order.  This gave me the hope that my bologna was freshly fried.  It was.  The taste of the bologna left a little something to be desired, but a good biscuit, like love, covers a multitude of sins.  And so it was with my sandwich.  I absolutely love their bacon, egg, and cheese, which I've had in some of their other locations.  The fries were a little on the salty side, so I'll stick to the hashbrowns in the future.  The service was friendly and the restaurant was clean with the condiments and fountain beverage are being serviced on a regular basis.  It's definitely worth a stop of you have an affinity for biscuits and breakfast.  Go early though, they close at 2:00pm."}
{"text":"Totally messed up my order food was bland and burned. I was there a while back and it was good. Must be poor management and quality control know. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Biscuitville was mentioned to us by a family member as well as a work colleague from the NC area as a good regional chain to try. So we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was very clean and welcoming. The employees were all kind and pleasant and they made biscuits fresh at the front where you can see them. The biscuits were indeed good as were the other items. The spicy chicken with honey biscuit sandwich was awesome. The prices were quite reasonable as well. The food isn't anything super, but it is solid good food at a good price and nice atmosphere. We'd certainly come back to Biscuitville if we're in the area."}
