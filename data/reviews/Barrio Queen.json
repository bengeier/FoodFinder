{"text":"The wait was ridiculous even though 90% of the tables were open. Tacos are tiny and $3.50 each. You have to ask for chips and salsa, they don't automatically bring it or ask if you would like it. The food is very good but I've never left a Mexican restaurant hungry, first time for everything. I've been to Barrio Not a good value for the money. Joyride, which is right down the street knocks Barrio out of the water with regards to price and a friendly, welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are visiting Scottsdale from NJ and we just happened upon BQ one afternoon while exploring.  What drew us in was the sign outside announcing their $3 tacos and $3 margaritas during happy hour.  This was a great find.  We had a few tacos, 2 of which were the happy hour special that day and one extra -- one was salmon & mango which my bf said was amazing, another had cactus in it, and mine was pulled pork if I remember correctly.  Both the food and margs were amazing.  The bartenders were extremely friendly, one even gave us a bunch of recommendations of bars to check out while we were in town.  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars from me is because it closes so early.  It seems like so many restaurants in this area close by like 9 or 10pm, which is crazy to me because Im used to not even going out to dinner until 830 or 9pm.  Regardless, we're going to try and stop in again before we leave."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with this review..

We were seated quickly, but the service the entire night was TERRIBLE. It took a good 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged my party. Then another HOUR for our food. There was only four of us and the restaurant was not packed. How long could it  possibly take to make a couple of burritos and carnitas? After the hour long wait, two of the plates of food came out cold. 

My carnitas were delicious the second time they came out and were hot, but it was hard to enjoy my experience with such lackluster service. I will commend them, we complained and of course got the complimentary dessert. 

**Side note** The guacamole is over priced. I paid $10 to have an avocado poorly mashed up with a spoon and a few other ingredients mixed in. For $10 I expect more effort and MORE GUAC. Such a rip off. 

The food isn't even authentic."}
{"text":"Gosh, having been here about 6 times since it opened seems like it keeps getting worse.  Had a terrible meal the other night, took an hour to get our guacamole.  Looked understaffed, lots of tables with empty plates stacked on them.  Took an hour and a half to eat there, just 3 tacos and enchilades.  If you want good tacos go to Tacos Atoyac in phoenix and if you are in old town and want better mexican just go to Frank and Lupes, half the cost and better.  *Our waiter was really good though and was sorry about the wait for our food, looked like he was doing a lot of jobs at once, others just standing around.  We both decided we won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants. I frequently visit the Gilbert location and am never disappointed! The food is always delicious; everything is fresh and everyone I bring here absolutely loves it. The atmosphere is fun and unique; this restaurant is very fun in the evenings with its lively nightlife and also great for lunch with the family. This has long been a favorite Friday night out place for me and my friends.  I have never had a bad dish at Barrio queen and rave to everyone about how much I love the food. Everything on the menu is delicious and there is a great variety of things to try. I also love the drinks at Barrio Queen - if you are a fan of margaritas like me, then this is a perfect place for you. The drinks are well-crafted with fresh ingredients and the bartenders are very skilled and knowledgeable, as well as very friendly and helpful if you aren't sure what you want. Victor is the absolute best and provides excellent service. He is always very friendly and makes awesome margaritas. Everyone loves Victor and I saw many other reviews mentioning him - he is truly a Barrio customer favorite!

I love Barrio Queen so much that I decided to have my graduation party at the Gilbert location and worked with Barrio Catering to get everything put together and ready for the party. They made it so easy and stress-free to have a party of 60 people. My guests LOVED the food and drinks and it was a huge hit; many people told me that it was the best Mexican food they had ever had. The staff was so excellent and friendly. I couldn't believe how easy it was to set everything up- Barrio worried about all the details for me and made sure I had enough food for all of my guests; I am so thankful for what a great experience I had and that I didn't have to worry about a thing! The staff was attentive the entire time during my party and my guests always had everything they needed. Thank you Barrio Queen for making my party so special and always being so delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service.  Staff I'd awesome we will be back. We are so happy to have this in our home town. Yummy"}
{"text":"Love the cool urban atmosphere. The food was great and authentic. 3 words: homemade tortillas. What prompted me to make sure I review was when the management went above and beyond for me. Long story short,  I left my receipt with a company card purchase and called in panic to ask if they could find and email it to me. They asked all the questions to be able to track it down and my panic was competely relieved with the way they handled it!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, and probably the last time, this past Saturday. We walked in, oddly, this was the only place without a wait, of all the restaurants in the area. We were seated in a corner, which took a while for us to be served. Once our server finally acknowledged us, she asked if we had been there before. We said no, so then she felt the need to explain the entire menu to us, as if we didn't know how to read. Once she finished, we ordered drinks and she brought us their chips and salsa. The salsa had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, which should've been our first clue to run. We stayed and then ordered our meals. I ordered their grilled fish tacos, seemed simple enough...until my plate was delivered to our table. I took a bite, without paying attention, and immediately spit out my food. It was a SHRIMP taco! They are lucky I was not actually allergic to shrimp, I only dislike them because of a bad experience. They didn't even comp us for this mistake. Come on, somebody could die from this kind of mistake. I now understand why this was the only restaurant without a wait. Will not be returning and will not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Barrio queen. Little sister of barrio cafe, same menu basically but not the same quality. Happy hour margaritas are good, taco prices are fair and food is pretty tasty but more generic than the cafe. I've had the chiles en nogada and cochinita pibil entrees are my favorite but a little pricey so I usually just do tacos. If you want the good version go to the original Barrio Cafe in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is Bad, real Bad. 12-26-17.
Maybe it was because it was the day after Christmas and the good help is off.
Even though we ordered the Asada and Camaron tacos, it should have been called onion tacos.
The onions were so strong we couldn't eat them. I had to go wash my hands after trying to take them off the taco.
The corn was pitiful and should have been advertised as Delmonte from a can.
Sorry, but this was well below acceptable."}
{"text":"Incredibly authentic...the thick chips were great just wish salsa had a bit more bite.  The Cochinita Pibil Taco is so good and would strongly recommend. I will definitely become a repeat diner!"}
{"text":"The server was nice but the service was extremely slow. The restaurant was not overly crowded. We waited over an hour for our food. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm. I ordered the Barrio pollo burrito.  It was good but not warm enough. I wouldn't go back due to the service. The food was just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic Mexican food! The Arizona burrito is a must!! Great music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"By far worst service, wait staff, and management in the valley, poor attitude, from the front of the house to manager.. Food very average. Over All. Poor dining experience.  Don't waste your time.. Can you take away stars. ? No never mind they don't have any."}
{"text":"Ever had a soggy chicken quesadilla? Well you will find it here at Barrio Queen in Gilbert. Not worth the money. But the the bartender had great service. Frankly, the service is the only thing keeping this restaurant alive, because the food is not good. It's either soggy or cold to order. Not good."}
{"text":"Overpriced, hipster Mexican-ish food.  Service was lacking and food was not great.  The Carne Asada was very tough and grisly.  Our server was friendly but not very attentive.  I realize that every place has an off night, but I kind of get the feeling this is normal operating procedure for the Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my best friend and had happy hour. Service was stellar food was awesome sauce. Got to try several of the home brewed tequila that were stellar. We will be back. Thanks Luke, Kat,Victor . These two Dead Heads had a grateful time."}
{"text":"Our first and not likely to come back for awhile.  Empty tables all over but still had to wait for text. When asked why the wait was told they just opened and they wanted to make sure the kitchen could keep up. Is this thier first resturant ?
 
We got to seats at the bar and ordered.  I had three very small tacos - not much flavor. Husband got the carne asads burro he liked it.  Chips were mixed some stale some fresher (yesterdays) and the salsa was way to mild with little flavor. 

WIll stick to tried and true Euro Cafe when we want to head to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos I ordered were dry. I had to take a drink of my water with every bite. The hostesses were half asleep and the whole experience was kinda...blah."}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly when other plans fell through. Awesome place, fun decor, great food. The tacos are street food style- small but packed with flavor. The enchiladas suiza were good, though I thought the chicken was a little under flavored. Service was friendly and good. Table side guacamole was great, topped with pomegranate seeds, unexpected and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a rating of the bartenders only that were on duty today Mothers Day at about 1 PM only.  My husband and I sat down at the bar.  We were not greeted or acknowledged in any way.  We scanned the menu that was sitting on the bar, put the menu aside and waited for service.  As we waited, two ladies came in and sat next to us.  They were served quickly, their drinks came, and their lunch order was taken.  We waited a bit longer and finally decided to leave as it had become obvious that we were being ignored.  Horrible!"}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant twice before and had a good experience. So I took out of town guests last week and it was the worst experience. The food was awful and the service was terrible. I don't know what happened but I won't go back. I was so embarrassed that I kept apologizing to my family. The hostess ignored us as we asked for help at least twice as she passed our table. She just rolled her eyes and walked on. Our waiter was never around when we needed service. He forgot to put in the order for one of the diners. Everyone's food was tasteless, dry and the children's meal was so over cooked that it wasn't edible. There is no excuse for what we experienced and there is no need to return."}
{"text":"Last night was their opening night and it was a disaster. It was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I met a friend there and we sat at the bar waiting for our table. She arrived first and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. We were seated after about 30 minutes. No one came for a drink order for 10 minutes. We received our drinks and were told they were no longer taking food orders by the server. We had chips and salsa at the table and had to ask for plates and napkins. They brought beverage napkins. A manager did not proactively come around and offer apologies, to comp drinks or offer a gift certificate for a future visit. We asked for a manager to inquire about the issue. She said their computer system went down and they had no way to get orders to the kitchen. I suggested writing them down and she said that wasn't an option because the kitchen staff only speaks Spanish. We told her to let us know if anything changed and that we were not going to be paying a bill due to the inconvenience. We had already paid for drinks and the table side guac at the bar. She said that was fine. They ended up bringing us two appetizers after an hour and a half. At the end of the night they tried to bring us a bill and we reminded them we were told he would not have to pay for anything. If it were me I would have done anything to keep customers happy and prevent them from leaving. Think outside the box, problem solve when an issue arises. When we arrived it was packed and after about an hour it appeared to be only about 20% occupied. Overall it was a terrible experience and the majority of the staff severely lacked customer service skills, not to mention it was a restaurant that did not serve food! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Overall, I had just an \"okay\" experience here. I was a little hesitant to come here after reading some of the reviews, but a group of friends set up everything so I thought I'd give it a try. 

I came to Barrio Queen with a group of 5 (one was a child) other people. It was Friday night around 7pm, so I was expecting a busy place, but it definitely wasn't bursting with people. We were quoted a two hour wait and were sat after an hour, which I suppose is alright. After being sat, our waitress (who was really, really nice) promptly got our drink orders. I was happy with this, considering some of the other reviews indicated lengthy waits. Well, after getting our drink orders it took about 10 minutes for them to arrive. Okay, a group of 7 people, I get it, but none of the drinks were that complicated so I was a little disappointed by that extensive wait for drinks. Keep in mind, there were empty tables and the place was not jam packed with people. On the bright side, our waitress did keep our chips and salsa filled. So that's good. But when she got our food orders, that's where the waiting started. For a group of 7 people (one child), with no overly complicated orders, we waited 30 minutes for our food. 30 minutes! I mean, I get we're a fairly big party, but 30 minutes is still a really long time to wait for food. On top of that, three people joined us right as we got our food, promptly ordered, and got their food within 10 minutes. Their order seemed either incomplete or messed up, too. 

Overall, just an \"okay\" experience. The waits are lengthy and I felt the prices were a little high for just \"okay\" food. Is this my new favorite hangout? No. Am I dying to come back? No. The atmosphere is cool and our waitress was really, really nice, but I definitely didn't leave feeling enamored."}
{"text":"This place is all right. I really can't complain; food was decent, our server was amazing, knowledgeable, and had good and obviously heartfelt suggestions for both our table and another.

The prices are a little high, but I think it's overhead (given the fancy interior, Scottsdale location, full bar, and number of employees). The food seems to be high-quality, as well. All I'm saying is that you can get comparable food (Mexican) elsewhere for cheaper.

Still, a good place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as it seems BQ has gone downhill. Went for taco Tuesday. Ordered tacos, beans and elote \"cocktail.\" The saddest part was the tacos. Had shrimp taco that arrived with fish in it. Sent it back and when it came back there was ONE shrimp in it. Lots of cabbage, very skimpy on the good stuff.
elote was about a cup of corn drizzled with sauce. Not sure how this is an appetizer. It is enough for one person at most. Beans were cold, crusty and dry.
this place used to be good. The only positive was the service, which was friendly. Not sure we'll ever be back. Even the chips were cold and stale. Major disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. First off, the host was completely rude!!! It was clear that the restaurant wasn't that busy because of all the empty tables but she told me and my husband \"It's going to be an hour wait so I'm not sure if you want to wait\". One way or another I WAS going to eat so I happily said \"That's ok we will wait :) \" 20 min later we get seated. What an hour that was! But on to the food!! We ordered the Queso Fundido. Not so great. Chorizo, mushrooms and peppers are delicious but the cheese was so thick that we couldn't even dip the chips in to scoop them out. We also ordered 3 tacos each. Pescado asado, El pastor and carne asada with chorizo. All delicious, especially the unique in house made tortillas. El pastor was complimented well with the pineapple, might be too dull without it and the carne asada/chorizo was a little dry but the salsa helps. Also they were alot smaller then i thought. Overall it was an ok place."}
{"text":"Where oh where do I start ? Went in for dinner last night expecting to eat some delicious Mexican food ! It was pretty dead and server greeted us very nicely! Got our drink orders in and enjoyed the delicious Paloma margarita . That is pretty much where the good for the night ended . We ordered the guacamole and it is made table side so I was expecting awesomeness ! She put all the ingredients in and stated mushing everything around with a spoon and served it to us with huge chunks of avocado still in there not mushed ! I proceeded to try to mush it myself as much as possible . Flavor of guacamole was mediocre . Way too much lime and just tasted bland. I should have just held off on ordering entrees at that point but we decided to order anyway. WRONG CHOICE! I ordered brisket burrito. Super salty and the meat had zero flavor . They drench it in sauce and it still doesn't mask that meat taste. My partner ordered the mole enchiladas and also were not good! The drinks were good and that's about it! Worst 70 dollars ever spent! Server was really nice though !!"}
{"text":"I visited Scottsdale for a week (never been to Arizona before).  I arrived on Sunday and stopped in Barrio Queen for lunch.  Service was very friendly and on point.  I was by myself and sat at a table.  My waitress took the time to actually talk to me even though she had many other tables she was waiting.  I ordered off the taco menu (very extensive with many different choices).  I liked that it was almost like ordering sushi where I had to mark what I wanted on a paper menu.  Food came quickly and service was with a smile.  

I liked the place so much, that I returned later in the week (5 days later to be exact).  This time I came for dinner and sat at the bar since I was again eating alone and I hate taking up a table when there are bigger parties that could make better use of said table.  As I walked up to the front door, I was greeted by the hostest.  She quickly pointed out that she remembered me from earlier in the week.  I thought this was very impressive since I had only ever been there once and I'm sure she sees a ton of people coming and going while seating people.  As I said before I sat at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly.  He was talkative, but not overly like some bartenders tend to get...where it sometimes gets annoying.  He suggested a beer for me to try since I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink and I'm pretty open to trying new things.  He even took the time to give me the history of that very beer brand.  As I was looking over the menu, a waitress that was not even working my area stopped and looked over my shoulder as she was waiting for drinks from the bar.  She made a few suggestions for things I should try and pointed out what her favorites where.  I didn't even ask and here the staff was going out of their way to make my experience a  good one.  When you work in any industry, customer service is the KEY to success!!!  I did take her advice and ordered a chicken dish that she had suggested.  I REALLY loved it!!!  I will definitely recommend Barrio Queen to others visiting the area!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the barrio queen in scottsdale, great service, very good food. Called the gilbert location, they dont do reservations. Was told to come and hour early to get seating for my party and the wait would be 45 mins, no problem. Got there an hour early (6pm) to get seating set up, expected the 45 minute wait (party was at 7pm)and the hostess told me it would be a 2 hour wait! I didnt give any grief but i was clearly unhappy about the miss information and found another restaurant that was able to seat us immediately. Everybody arrived to the other restaurant and was seated immediately, on time. Props to Brio  at SanTan mall for understanding situation and accommodating us. I did get a text from barrio queen at 7pm saying our table was ready. That was very upsetting but everyone was happy with everything at Brio. You missed out on a great party and a great deal of money Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"Wow.  The food at Barrio Queen will not disappoint.  While on a business trip in April we stopped here at the recommendation of a local friend.  We had a lot of tacos already during our trip so I ordered the Torta de Carne Asada (a steak sandwich) and could not stop devouring it!  My only con was that we were on the way to the airport and I couldn't take my leftovers.  There's just nothing comparable in the midwest..."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the Margaritas.  It was taco Tuesday and it took forever to get the races.  $2.50 a piece.  They were small but very good.  I made the mistake of ordering flan and it took forever to get.  They have it to me for free but I wish I said forget it.  It wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I like authentic Mexican Food since I am Hispanic. I have to say that Barrio Queen exceeded my expectations. I had the chile relleno and I absolutely loved that they didn't bread the chile poblano. It was filled with veggies and the flavors were a delicious combination. Atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding. We will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice but casual atmosphere.  Come casual or fancy. Bring kids or leave them home and enjoy the patio. Tip: excellent burrito especially pulled pollo (tip: add chorizo)!"}
{"text":"Stay awaaaaaay. Food is not bad they just add too much cheese to wverytning. They dont have salsa. Looool. Chips only served with $12 guacamole made with one avocado.  How sketchy is that?  Service is also mediocre. Wont be coming back here. You should not even try this place. Trust the negative comments."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the service was outstanding. So not order the specialty cocktails (worst ever), but any classic drink is done well. Cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant countless times since they first opened. The tacos are really tasty, and are the only reason I go back, because their service is certainly nothing to return for. When they first opened I figured they were still working the kinks out with their servers. Since they opened in 2012 and it is now 2014 and the service remains the same, if not worse, I am led to believe they just don't care that their servers are absolutely ignorant to how to serve people as well as being ignorant to customer service skills. From sitting at a table and waiting over 10 min to even be asked for a glass of water (only after I complained, mind you), to the same server continually getting portions of my entire  parties order wrong on several different visits, to absent waiters who act put out when you have to keep asking for things because you've been waiting for an extended amount of time even when the restaurant isn't busy....one can only conclude that they don't care about their customers as they keep these incompetent imbeciles employed at their establishment. If the tacos weren't so tasty I would certainly never return."}
{"text":"Awesome Tacos!
First, Barrio Queen is in a great location with plenty of parking nearby in Old Town Scottsdale.  It is definitely a different look and feel than Barrio Cafe in Phoenix--more contemporary and great draft beer selection!  I arrived with a friend just a little too early for happy hour (too bad because they have great specials on tacos), and we each ordered about 2-3 tacos.  Loved the way tacos are ordered, just like at as sushi restaurant, so they bring them to you as you want them.  Service was a little slow, although there were plenty of staff milling around and not exactly rush hour.  But the food more than made up for that, and as they opened relatively recently, I'm assuming they need to get a few kinks out of their service.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was horrible.  Will not be coming back.  There are a lot of other places in this town to get mexican food.  Have to be better than this."}
{"text":"Genius! The flavors and combination of textures are amazing.  Took a little while but I'm not mad at that like some people can get lol.  Our server was very attentive, delightful man.  
Really I can't get over the pomegranate in the guacamole!! Such a great combination!!
I had the 3 tacos:  fish, carne asada, and brisket. 
Superb.  I will definitely be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"I really want to rave about this place because there were some big positives. The patio seating was beautiful, the decor and art was awesome, and the whole place has this kind of upscale trendy fusion vibe. The burrito my husband ordered was seriously amazing--some kind of pulled pork that had fresh flavor and delicious sauce. 

However, our service was seriously lacking. We waited forever for everything, and she forgot out $11 table-side made guacamole. She wasn't around, so we had to ask a server at a nearby table where it was, and when she finally came to make it, she just kind of rushed through it and slammed it on the table. We asked for moderate spice and the guac was totally flavorless. The ingredients were of good quality, and I actually thought the addition of pomegranate would have been nice if we weren't essentially given a flavorless bowl of avacado hunks. 
I ordered the fried shrimp tacos, which were completely average. I ate one of the three and gave the rest to my husband.  

I should have known better than to order dessert, but I did it anyway--mostly because I was still hungry from not eating my tacos. I ordered churros, and it took half an hour to get one. freaking. churro. The server came up to us to tell us she was scared to come to our table because she knew it was taking way too long, and complained that she didn't know why they weren't done because all it took was for them to dump it in the fryer. When it actually got to the table, it was completely overdone. I didn't finish it. 

Hubby's food and margarita were solid, mine was mediocre at best, and the service was bad. I would give this place one more try, but I was pretty disappointed because it was recommended by several people."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I've been to most of the restaurants downtown Gilbert and this one is a winner.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the happy hour. $3 margs and very very cold beer. Delicious soft taco specials and the guac is very fresh."}
{"text":"In a Gist: This is truly a \"meh\" experience. The food is average given the price range. The ambiance and service are also not features to scream about either. Given the fact that Barrio Queen does not take reservations, nor does it call you when your name is up on their wait-list, this is simply not worth it in my mind. 

Accessibility: Drive and park. I was in Scottsdale for one night so I don't know what public transit/walking to this place is like. 

Ambiance: Meh. It's really nondescript. They have a pseudo industrial feel going on with bottles of tequila in metal framing throughout the restaurant but that doesn't really do it for me. 

Service: Meh again. They were more or less on top of their game but my water did not get as much attention as I'd like. If I were to lump together putting our name on the waitlist, going to another bar, returning 45 minutes later (we were told it was a 45 minute wait) and finding that we had to wait another 20 minutes because our name was called and we weren't there, then this would be downgraded to a \"nope\". I realize they expect us to sit there (and perhaps spend money at their bar which had not room for us to stand at) but most places call you (as in phone call) when your name is up.

Food: 

I had three tacos for ten dollars. As others have mentioned, these are small tacos. I'm talking about two normal sized bites per taco. Unless you're only slightly peckish, three is not enough. The tacos are also unremarkable. Edible, acceptable but nothing special. Since I was still a bit hungry after my three tacos, I ordered the flan for dessert. Also meh. Perhaps I'm holding it to too high of a standard (my last flan before the one I had here was absolutely superb). Worth the 6 dollars I paid? Maybe. Maybe not.

Overall Assessment: It should be fairly obvious from my review. This place is the epitome of \"meh\". Nothing exceptional. A general let down and waste of time. I regret not having stayed at Second Story Liquor Bar where we had drinks while waiting for our dinner as well. The food and menu looked much better than the Barrio Queen (I know it's not the same style but this isn't going to quench any desperate Mexican food urges)."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best! The Horchata is made in house from scratch and is the best I've had. Tres Leches is also amazing!"}
{"text":"The ambience was great. Our server was the best. All her recommendations were spot on. The lunch portions were just right"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our server was awesome! Loved her! Continuing on....

Barrio Queen is not affiliated with Chef Silvana...which you can clearly take notice after dining there. 

Food temperature isn't hot like other restaurants. 

Lastly, while we were there dining and we witnessed them turning away customers at 9:30 because the kitchen was closed. Mind you they close at 10pm. I've been a server myself and have had small/large parties walk in 5 mins before closing and we served them. I think they need to reevaluate management. And while Chef Silvana isn't affiliated it's her name and reputation that come to mind with Barrio Queen. Show her some respect and get it together.

I'm giving it 2 stars because the service was awesome. But seriously get it together because Joyride and Postinos were very busy tonight."}
{"text":"Lunch. 1215. Tuesday.
Party of 5. 
Very friendly staff; engaging. 
Has an Old Mexico, open feeling inside - ceramic tiling and traditional decor, but classy and modern. There is patio seeing front and back. 

Food: Burrito Azteca, Chicken salad, Tacos (it was Taco Tuesday so 4 for $10 mix and match). Table guacamole appetizer that had pomegranates in it. Yum! Chips were excellent, as was the salsa. Salsa watery but delicious and mild. No options for spicy salsa though, but you can request roasted jalapenos, which I did. Excellent, Smithers. 

A little pricey for lunch, but hey, it's Barrio in Snottsdale. What do you expect?

Recommended."}
{"text":"Wait time of 20 minutes on a Thurs was reasonable.  The chips and mild salsa were tasty.  Unfortunately, that's where my satisfaction ended. The guacamole and queso barely provided a taste for six adults.  The tacos were absolutely the smallest I have ever been served.  They had little flavor. None of our food had much flavor and no spice.  If you're afraid of spicy Mexican, this place is for you.  Otherwise, there are much more flavor-able places in the area."}
{"text":"If you want food \"a toda madre\" go to Barrio Cafe in Phoenix.  Barrio Queen is more gringo style wanna-be tex mex food.  Bland, bland, bland.  Awful house margarita, tasteless salsa and chips, overpriced, would rather drive 35 minutes to Phx than go to Barrio Queen, and I live in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Food and Service was great!! I love their happy hour menu. My friends' taco from dinner menu was also worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Great happy hour and awesome staff. Anthony is super fast and friendly getting your cocktails ready. 

Get the elote!!!  You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I ate here on Friday May 8. Got right in. Love the decor and the staff is super friendly. My co-workers had the Guacamole made right at the table and said it was yummy. A little pricey for what you get though.  I had the 3 tacos for $10, tasted great but really tiny. Like if your tacos had home had baby tacos. But good size if you want to eat light which is what I wanted so it if your starving you will want something else. Overall for the first week it was great and you can tell the staff is trained very well. Cant wait to try the Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Second time in town and I had to come back.  Food is great.  Feel like I'm in Mexico in here.. Love the people and decor.  Not had one bad bite here!!"}
{"text":"Our server was great. Except for the Pozzole which was excellent, the food was way too greasy.  The chips were too thick and greasy and needed more flavor. The highlights were our server and the pozzole. Don't think we will be back ever."}
{"text":"Margarita drinkers..this is a Mexican food establishment. Margarita is a Mexican alcoholic drink...Right? Well appears not so at this establishment. Your not advised that when ordering a Margarita your paying for the \"Tequila\" which at the minimum price is $6.00 (rot gut stuff)...but the kicker here is there is an additional \"UP CHARGE\" of $2.00+/- per drink, for the non alcoholic ingredients that make a Margarita!! So in my case, I do like Hornitos tequilla. 
I have been to the Gilbert restaurant three times. I order the same ingredients in my margarita every where I go...Hornitos, Reposado, fresh squeezed line juice, with a small amount of agave sweetener...Simply those three ingredients. So day one, I ordered my normal and found they had it on the menu. Great! Every time, same order...I looked at my receipts after the third and final visit, found my self paying a different price,( more) each visit. 
First visit, I had 3! (ends up it was the rot gut and not the Hornitos).  I was charged 
$9.00 for the tequilla and the infamous \"Up charge\" for the \"Margarita\"... Second visit, I thought I was getting lucky, I had 2 of the same Margaritas, being charged $8.00 each this time and the \"upcharge\"...So ok. My last visit..ONE usual margarita, tequila this time was $12.00!!!!! plus, you guessed it..The \"up charge\". Ok 3 visits, 3 same Margarita order...Time to discuss the bills with the manager. This is where I found out about the \"UP CHARGE\"!! He also indicated to me that his bartender made a mistake and didn't charge me the \"Up charge\" on one of my bills!! I felt like I was going to have to give him more $$. He stood behind all the charges. OKEY DOKEY... So, what I am doing as a loyal friend, for those of you, who enjoy a good drink at a good value...is just letting you know the practices of this establishment. Price out what you order to avoid sticker shock at the end. I HIGHLY advise you to watch the pour if you are asking for a particular tequila, beyond their basic offering. Unfortunately after all this, it has tainted my impression of the food as well. I'll give it a mediocre for local Mex foods. (I grew up in San Diego where there is some pretty fine Mexican Restaurants. 
I hope this helps you in the future.

UP DATE: I received a reply from a Mindy representing Barrio Queen, no information as to what her position was. She requested a reply from me to fix the issues. This was my reply:
Mindy, 
Thank you. Unfortunately an attempt was made, as noted in my remarks. I am done! 
I might suggest you read many of the problematic comments posted on Yelp already. It clearly shows where your serious issues lie. I think addressing a lot of those will help tremendously in getting your staff serving the customers in a way that your customers leave happy. Those are your repeat people.
Personally you bar needs a lot of attention. Also in my review I noted some management issues as well. Which hit close to my heart.
The best of luck to you.Kathy --"}
{"text":"The brisket burrito is outstanding. Very good service and great food. The area has a great vibe as well. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The drinks were delicious, I recommend the Chapo. Service was iffy, the bartenders seemed too busy nd annoyed.

The food was disappointing, though. Everything was bland and tasteless--we ordered elote fries, tacos, fundida cheese, and the sonoran dog. Everything just seemed really under-seasoned and we did not finish our meal. 

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I ate at this location a few years ago while on business travel and enjoyed the meal.  This visit was somewhat disappointing for me and my family.  I can handle spicy food, but on this day my food was so spicy I was not able to eat it.  I'm the type of person that will never send back my meal, but I will bring it to the attention of my waiter.  The management offered me a free desert for pointing out the issue with their entree. Unfortunately, we won't be back to the Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Im currently the Duke here and I'm writing this review reluctantly but it's neccesary I think because as a loyal customer I have been let down too many times on recent visits. I have been coming here since day 1 but things have changed, the last few times I have been here its been on a steady decline. Finally my last visit I have had it. Service is the worst in town, employees have bad attitudes and don't care, always understaffed, didn't have small bills to give change from the register, dirty bar, dirty tables, undercooked cold chips, no attention from bartenders as drinks run out etc etc etc. I don't know what happened internally here but it's not the same as it once was. What was one of my favorite spots has become a sinking ship. Based on the information the employees readily complain about in front of their guests about management and staffing turn over I'll be surprised if this place makes it much longer. It's a sad thing. Food is still great though - if they don't run out of whatever taco you order."}
{"text":"Unable to get verde Posole with out onions ask when ordered said ok but then they were unable to do dinner for my wife already served"}
{"text":"Wow! I was recommended here by my brother and WOW was he right! The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. I personally had the carne asada and the carne asada chorizo azul and both were warm and flavorful. I tried a bite of my sisters Barrio Pollo burrito and it was also a great choice. The atmosphere is amazing, but beware it is a pet friendly patio. Otherwise a great choice, and definitely worth 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great experience at Barrio Queen. It was busy but worth the wait. Love how they make the guacamole rights that table. The food was delicious and we tried their signature Chiles en Nogada and their Cochinta Pibil dishes. They were delicious and very flavorful. I tried their Blanco Sangria which was sweet with a crisp aftertaste."}
{"text":"The food and service were great here!  They defiantly bring a taste of Mexico to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying the food here tonight, and really loved the decor and style of the place. The chips were good, not great, and the salsa had decent flavor but no heat at all (which if you can't handle spicy food, could be great for you). Unfortunately, for my palate, blandness from their food was a recurring theme. We started off with the barrio papas elote style, but it didn't really have much flavor to me, down to the fries. For mu entree, I got the three tacos meal with carnitas, carne asada, and barrio pollo tacos with a side of rice. None of the tacos were hot upon arrival, and they were all pretty average, although I did think the barrio pollo was decent, I wouldn't go back just to eat it again. The rice reminded me of white rice that had been mildly spiced.

I will say, the food was out quickly and the service was good. Ultimately, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"If you like Guy Fieri, you'll love the food. If you love food, you may not appreciate the service or the lack of consistency in the product."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the holidays, but service was sooooo slow. Horrible! I'd understand if it was packed but they were just understaffed. Plenty of open tables. They would have been better off closing than providing a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was good!  Chips and salsa were awesome!!!   However they did get my boyfriends order wrong.  Kind of ruined our night out."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a delicious place with genuine personality and service that makes a big difference. Victor is one of the BEST bartenders ever!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were walking through Old Town looking for a place for lunch when we found Barrio Queen. The Decor is to die for. It's very eclectic & the cages they keep the top shelf tequilas are pretty neat. The drinks were delicious. I had a michelada & the BF had a Paloma. Our bartender was really sweet & efficient. I want to say her name was Melissa (cute blonde chick). The food great. I don't normally like black beans but their's were awesome. Only problem with this place is their guac. When I think of guac I think of a paste sorta texture. Their guac was literally chopped up avocado & tomato. Also lacked some lime & salt. Despite the guac I'd come back."}
{"text":"The food was good. However the service was miserable! We spent most of our dinner looking for our server(Alexis) who I guess was having a bad night?? She seemed to be out of sorts. The maitre due or the manager had to come over and take our order. Simple things of getting silverware for the table, chips to go with our queso, glasses of water for the very spicey salsa were huge feats for our waitress.
We (a family of 4) will not be coming back. We were impressed with the decor but nothing else."}
{"text":"Love to go here for tacos and a michalada. Gets busy at dinner so lunch on weekdays is best for me."}
{"text":"Great Food and Bre was awesome. Suggestion would be the shrimp tacos. I would definitely come back and specifically ask for Bre. Amazing time"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday afternoon, oh, about 3 p.m. It was a perfect time. Parking was not an issue. I was able to park in front of the restaurant. There was plenty of patio seating with lots of shade. I ordered the Carnitas en Chile Verde appetizer. Delish! As for the entree, Ivhad the Cochinita Pibil and it was sooooo good! The service was beyond excellent. I wish I could remember our server's name. She made sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely go back again! :)"}
{"text":"First time here, the bartender was very helpful in explaining the different tequila drinks and made a great one. Wait time wasn't to long to get a table. Cory our server was very knowledgeable explaining the menu and made awesome guacamole. The food was very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"We've gone to BQ twice in the past couple of months and both times the food has been very good and the service has been outstanding.  The meals arrive hot, the ingredients are fresh, and the portion sizes are more than adequate; I'm not a drinker so I'm not qualified to give a personal review on that, although a friend of mine was very happy with the wine she ordered with her meal.  The second time we went our helpful waiter (forgot the name, a very nice and efficient Hispanic kid who was always muy rapido with the drink refills) was making the fresh tableside guacamole and apologized for what he felt were poor quality avocados, he actually went back to retrieve some others which - according to him - weren't any better.  He apparently has an eye for avocado detail because the guac was not as good as our first visit, but certainly not terrible (3 out of 5 for the guac; 4-1/2 out of 5 our first visit).

The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, but don't go here with a Del Taco budget in mind.

BQ is located in downtown Gilbert which means it's safe and family friendly practically by default.  I always see plenty of Gilbert PD cruising up and down Gilbert Road which, when you stop by for a late meal, gives you added peace of mind.  I'm not implying that Gilbert is Maryvale, it's actually 180 degrees different; the fact that they're driving around is a good thing as they're not stopping to toss ne'er do wells and derelicts into the paddy wagon like you see every 20' in downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great drinks. Anthony is the man, great bartender. 

Thanks Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Best mexican food i have had in a resturant. Would def come again and again."}
{"text":"Great Food & Service! The vibe of Old Town was beautiful  and one of the few hidden jewels of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have gone to other locations, and this one was just as good! Loved the atmosphere and live music. 

We started with the guac and some margaritas. While still delicious, it was not quite what I had remembered it to be fromm the other locations. Although, as others have said, this could be just the opening kinks. 

We then got the Arizona burrito and the Cochinita pibil (one of my favorite dishes). Normally, the Cochinita pibil is the winning dish, in this case, the Arizona burrito kicked it right in the mouth and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the service, atmosphere, and fresh made table side guacamole. My $2 Tuesday tacos were delicious and the service was FAST! great drinks too, try the Titos with fresh lemonade and the red sangria. Great place for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Thank G for YELP pointing out good places. Really authentic Mexican good, great location with a BIG patio, fun crowd, good service.    And prices are reasonable.    All good."}
{"text":"I wish i could have rated the food, sadly i can not.  I wish i could have rated the drinks, sadly i can not.  We came in on a Monday afternoon at 1PM for the first and only time.  We were promptly seated inside, water and menus were delivered, and then we had no other contact with any employee until we decided to leave 20 minutes later.  This wasn't us sitting for 5 minutes and we were just impatient.  After receiving water and menus we waited for more than 20 minutes with no contact with any other employee before deciding to leave.  It was like all of the employees were avoiding any eye contact with us and contact in general on purpose, even after our water was gone.  Might have been okay if someone approached us to get drink orders, might have been fine if we had beer or chips or something.  We don't mind a long meal, but this was ridiculous.  There seemed to be adequate staff, didn't seem too busy, others were being served."}
{"text":"Super expensive for what it is in my opinion. The guacamole is not as good as Barrio Cafe and the tacos are tiny. The wait staff is very nice though and it's a good location in old town."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and I usually leave feeling -meh. I feel like Barrio is becoming more about the name and fame, less about the food and service. 

When we went our server was less than attentive and we had to ask for more water. The guac was good and I loved that it was made right at our table. The I got the enchiladas de mole. It was the worst mole sauce I have ever had, I couldn't even finish it without being grossed out. 

If I ever go back its for Margs and Guac...ONLY."}
{"text":"efficient and friendly staff. we tried a few tacos and their pork torta. all excellent. would have to try a few more entrees to see if they qualify for the top tier of mexican restaurants"}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere upon walking in and were given a great table outside. But, the good stuff ended there. Our waitress was extremely nice but not at all efficient. I had to ask numerous times to get water and our third margarita showed up after we had asked for the check. The dinner took forever to arrive and when it did, my carne asada tacos were very dry. No one in our party would go back for the food or bad service but the atmosphere was cool. Would go back for a cocktail and chips."}
{"text":"From our experience on July 5, 2014 I would say Barrio Queen is a good restaurant, and would recommend you try it.  We arrived just before 6 PM and were seated immediately.  We were brought their great chips, bean dip, and water right away.  Our server was right there with menus and asking for our drink orders.  The service continued to be perfect for the entire experience.

All three of us loved our dinners.  I had \"Chilies En Nogada\" ($24).  It was probably the best dish I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  This is one of their \"signature\" dishes.  Treat yourself.  You won't regret it.

My wife had Suizas Con Chorizo Enchiladas ($15.50) and it was very good too.  Our friend had the Arizona Burrito ($11), which she said was good too.  I had their Reina Sangria which was one of the better Sangrias I've had ($8).  The Dos XX Amber draft beer was only $3, which is a good price for a beer these days.

Overall we liked everything about the Barrio Queen, except maybe the Mexican music, and that ugly industrial concrete and bare pipe ceiling. 

We would go back.  In our opinion the food is a cut above most Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the Arizona burrito. The guacamole is awesome but pricey.  The wait tends to be long especially during high season but worth it for the awesome food."}
{"text":"Pozole was bland. Not authentic. Menudo has so much clove in it. They didn't know what Chile de arbol was (which you always get, crushed, as a side). Chips, tortillas and hot salsa were good. I'll go to Tortas Ahogadas next time for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Tried the Barrio Queen for the first time and it was great!!! Happy hour prices on drinks are good. Had the guacamole and tried a couple different tacos and they were all very delicious. Our server was Yvette and she was great, friendly, sweet and very helpful. They have 2 bars so if they are busy and there is a wait- they offer the full menu at the bar. We will definitely be back and you should try it if you get the chance!!!"}
{"text":"We dine out regularly and are very discerning food people. They do not accept reservations and we waited almost an hour to be seated.  It was not worth the wait.  The food and atmosphere was acceptable.  Not good or bad...just acceptable. The 3 stars is for being satisfactory.  While waiting for a table, we waited at the bar and it was very loud.  We dined on the patio and it was pleasant. 

Overall it felt like a chain.  Nothing remarkable to report."}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday ever! Started off with table side made guac, to the chips and salsa, to choosing any combination of tacos to mix and match. Very reasonably priced and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is great. 

Great margaritas, great food!  Great tacos and burritos. 

Daniel the server is a Real G."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!
Im picky about \"house margaritas\" and I have to say that this place serves the best margarita I have ever had.  Our server, Taylor was awesome!  Great music and great vibe!!  I definitely recommend this place!  Oh-please try the churro desert!!!"}
{"text":"All the tacos are delicious and the pomegranate guacamole is incredible! My favorite Mexican restaurant in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, chips were stale, food was just ok, and we were charged for each soda refill ($20 for 2 sodas). We will never go there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday night around 8:30pm. It was a 45 min wait. The atmosphere was good, it was really crowded and the music could have been louder. The staff was all very friendly and pleasant. The food was really good once we finally got it. The wait to get our food once we finally sat was about 40min. They didn't even offer us chips and salsa. I looked at other Yelp reviews and that is how I found out that you have to request chips and salsa, they do not just bring them to you. We finally realized that right before our food came out. You would think the server would have offered it after we were sitting for over 20 min... if we go back, it will be when it is not so crowded."}
{"text":"Love the taco Tuesdays and especially the bartender Anthony! He is the funniest most knowledgeable and entertaining guy there...a real gem. So personable, made us feel right at home immediately."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Barrio Queen having been to the Barrio Cafe and loved that experience. I especially raved about the guac to my friends and we all agreed to go there for Cinco de Mayo. Overall the food was average, the drinks decent but the service was AWFUL. We got there on May 5th at about 3pm. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived but was packed by dinner time. The good stuff: they do have great happy hour specials with 2 tacos for $3, $3 drafts and $3 casa margs. And that's about it. The rest of the menu is pretty pricey, both for drinks and for food. The conchinita pibil is delicious and certainly worth it's reputation. The tacos were pretty tasteless and very dry (like \"eating jerky\" dry). No matter what some of the servers say, they actually do have salsa there so get either the red or green, it makes the tacos so much better. The casa marg is OK, but hardly a stand out. However the red sangria is really tasty. They put a mango puree at the bottom and it's light and refreshing without being too sweet. One of my friends is really into tequilas and the restaurant stocks over 300 varieties. She was really happy on that score. Unfortunately the service was terrible and turned what should have been a 2 hour 'drinks and dinner' event into a 5 hour saga. Bottom line, there are too many other places in the Valley that are really good, reasonably priced and have consistently good service. I hope they get their service issues sorted but it will be a long long time before I ever end up back there.

The service *sigh* If it weren't for the bizarre service I would probably have given this place 3 stars because of the sangria and the conchinita pibil. Anyway, the hostess was MIA when we arrived to the restaurant and it took almost 20 minutes just to find her. We then sat at our table for 15 minutes before our server finally came over.

So the first thing we ordered was the guac and chips. I've had the guacamole at the Barrio Cafe and it is awesome. The guac at Barrio Queen was almost all onions tossed in a little bit of avocado. We also watched, perplexed, as the tables after us all had their chips and guac prepared table-side, with the option of customizing the ingredients. We were not offered this option so I asked our server if I had ordered the wrong appetizer. She said that she had been too busy earlier (when the restaurant was empty) and just had the kitchen \"throw it together\" for her. We asked if we could have some salsa to go with our guac and she said they didn't make salsas at the Barrio Queen. What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't have salsa? Turns out the 2nd page of the menu says that they have bottomless salsas. We asked a different server and he brought out a red and a green salsa. FYI, they do not have a chips & salsa app but they do have little sides of salsa which we weren't charged for. I guess the trick was to ask for salsa *only* because if you use the words 'chips' and 'salsa' in the same sentence they'll tell you they \"don't do that.\" So bizarre.

It routinely took half an hour from the time we ordered a round of drinks until they all arrived. When we asked how the drinks were coming along several times they told us that the keg was being changed out. OK, I admit I don't know much about beverage distribution but I've never heard of margaritas or sangria being served from kegs. We had to flag people down to get our water refreshed, no one ever offered. They also wouldn't clear away empty glasses or plates unless we asked. At one point we had 13 empty glasses on the not-very-big-to-begin-with table.

When our food arrived we noticed that the plate had chorizo tacos, not the carnitas that we ordered. The server said he knew that(!) but the servers had been told the happy hour tacos were carnitas while the kitchen had been told they would be chorizo. We started to say we didn't want chorizo and he just walked away. We flagged down our actual server and he said we had to keep the chorizo tacos even though no one wanted them. He did eventually apologize for the mistake and we got the carnitas tacos and at the happy hour price."}
{"text":"Theme is excellent. Cool place to hang out. Food taste great  but it is like sushi where you may need to order a few items to feel fed."}
{"text":"This place came as a recommendation from the hotel I was staying at. I should have trusted Yelp instead. I usually hit places that have 4+ stars on yelp when I'm out of town, this place had 3 1/2. And that was a little high. 

We showed up and were told the wait would be 15 minutes and they were dead on, no complaints there. Once we sat down we had to chase down a waitress for our waitress after sitting for 15m and having no one acknowledge us at our table. 

Once we got our service I found the food ehhh.
Salsa was good but I've had waaaay better in Chicago. The Tacos came highly recommended, again, ehhhh. Frankly, this close to Mexico I expected way better. I can go to a million restaurants in Chicago with better tacos and worse yet I've  been to Irish bars in Chicago that have better tacos. Sorry I'll skip this place next time."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Barrio Queen. Our waiter was great, very friendly and quick to refill water on the hot night. We sat outside and the misters on the patio kept us cool despite the 100 degree weather. 

Complimentary chips and salsa were delicious--we ended up eating them all and had no room for ordering guacamole. 

Margaritas and both of our meals were delicious!"}
{"text":"Got seated next to the bar. The service was absolutely horrendous. They only opened a month ago so maybe they need time to weed out the poor waiters/waitresses. ordered several tacos and unfortunately, it took 40 minutes (had already waited for a table for 45 minutes). The food arrived cold. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new addition to the food scene in downtown Gilbert. Pricey menu for typical food. The tacos (I ordered two) were super small....not even kid-sized, more so for an appetizer, and that's if you get three of them. You need six tacos to make one regular sized taco.  Won't be returning. Barrio Café is still my favorite restaurant with the word Barrio in it!"}
{"text":"Think again before going here! I tried it about two months ago and the guacamole got me to try it a second time....what a mistake! Service was some of the worst I've ever had. Food was ok, nothing special. Chips were stale. Even the second basket they brought over when I requested a new one. The wait for our food (burrito & 3 tiny tacos) was about 40 min. Never again! Too bad too because they have a cute little patio!"}
{"text":"Never had a boring meal here.  Always fun with really interesting food.  Flavors go \"pow, Pow, POW\" in your mouth.

Whenever we take friends or visitors who are big into good food, we all have a great time.  Our friends from out of town are jealous that we have a place like this.

First time we went there, the chef/owner stopped by and chatted with us.  She explained how she had traveled around Mexico to learn the regional cuisines.  Well, she definitely paid attention because she now creates some amazing dishes.

All the food is excellent, the price is great and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Terrible, i mean TERRIBLE service.  this place is an absolute joke.  food is almost as bad as the service.  $4 for a tiny taco and no sides.  insane.  this place will be out of biz very soon."}
{"text":"Went with some friends from out of town who had never been to Scottsdale waterfront.  After a little walking we decided on Barrio Queen. All 3 guys ordered the California Enclilada plates which came with beans and some  I picked the 3 tacos (pollo, carne Asada, pork).   All were delicious.  It was just enough to fill me up.  Oh, I also had a glass go white Sangria...it was okay. I would try the red next time."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. From the unfriendly hostess to the inept waitress. Food was over priced and seemed like it had sat around all day on a hot plate. Regretting taking clients from out of town to this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I consider this our go to bar. The bar staff is the best in Gilbert. Couple that with the menu and you will love it!"}
{"text":"I REEAALLLY wanted to like this place. Honest I did. But a few things struck me as unnerving.

The atmosphere was nice and the place appeared very clean, which was good. Even the bathroom. My only issue was the watered down soap in the bathroom. Either step it up or lessen the amount of water used to dilute the concentrate. 

While there were quite a few items on the menu it was Taco Tuesday and, not wanting to place all my tacos in one basket, I THOUGHT it would be a good idea to branch out and try new spots. Ehhhh, bad idea.

The HH menu is sparse. Only one margarita option (please change the house tequila). I always know when I'm drinking cheap tequila when it burns going down. Lol. My goodness. The rita was JUST 'ok'. The parental unti left an entire rita and 4 taco's on her plate, leaving with the tab. She ditched me and went to Joyride. Lol.

As with other reviews, I had to ASK for chips and salsa. What mexican restaurant do they do that at?! The waitress asked 5 times if we wanted to order an appetizer. \"No, but I would like some chips and salsa\".  As a server, while you've tasted everything on the menu, my expectation is that you'd have an honest opinion on the tequila in the house margaritas. 

Taco Tuesday taco specials arent bad ($2.50 for any taco on the menu) but, they don't taste all that great.  True in what they way, you get what you pay for but these are regular menu tacos.  Which means, they taste like this all the time. I ordered a Verduo (veggie) and a grilled pescado (fish). The fish was grilled so that it was charred and crispy on the outside. And the flavor was bland. Not one to waste food, I ate around that. So basically, I had two veggie tacos. 

For $40 (9 taco's, 2 house rita's and a lemonade) ahhhhh, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service! Kimberly was our server and she was very knowledgeable of the menu. that was helpful since was our 1st visit. The food was flavorful and not the typical Sonoran-style Mexican many restaurants serve. Their prices were reasonable for the food you get. Even though the house margaritas are served in a Scotch glass, they packed a punch so a traditional margarita glass would've been too much. Desserts were original and delicious! We had a good time and we'll be back many times over!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but poor service - we waited about 10 mins before anyone came over to Us and they did once asked for our waiter. The appetizer we had to ask our waiter to go check on it after what seemed like an excessive wait- same with our entree."}
{"text":"Literally walked in and sat there for 10 minutes waiting to be seated. 3 different employees walked by and goofed off with each other and I wasn't acknowledged in the slightest. What HORRIBLE service. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.  Not sure what impressed me more  - the delicious food or the warm and friendly service.  Found Barrio Queen while walking around aimlessly  (I'm from out of town ) and was extremely pleased.  Tge fush tacos were hot, spicy,  and tasty.  Accompanied by a Dos Sequis Amber,  I had a perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the complaining is about. I have been to Barrio Queen twice. First time was when they had just opened and will admit, it was a bit of a mess but the food was still tastey. The taco list was a bit overwhelming. But this time, my husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had a GREAT experience. In fact, because of my high alert due to the not so great reviews on Yelp, I paid special attention to those diners that were leaving (as we sat near the door).  I observed and overheard their attitude and comments to the host. I did not hear a single negative comment or see a single look of disappointment.  In fact, it was the opposite. Diners were expressing how delicious the food was with hearty \"thank you, we will return\", \"will you take our picture in front of your \"barrio queen\" painting?\" and my personal favorite \"can we speak to the manager to let him know how great our experience was...our server was awesome!\"

We ordered the Pollo y Chorizo Tacos to share and they were yums! I would probably order JUST these and a house margarita - which were also very tastey. In addition, we order the Elote (bowl of corn, cannot recall the exact menu item name) and the mexican style fries that are listed on the appetizer menu, again, sorry I cannot recall and cannot access the menu on their website to reference. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, the atmosphere less hectic than the first time around and the menu has been refined to be easier to read and not so over-the-top as far as choices and number of items. 

This may quickly become our new place for street style tacos and margaritas. We have to check out Taco Tuesday for SURE very soon.

Run don't walk to Barrio Queen for a cool atmosphere, a refreshing margarita and some tastey Pollo y Chorizo Tacos!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about staying true to the principles of your restaurant, $2 for three four-inch tortillas, and why you shouldn't hold your hand over your face to gesture, \"God dammit...these fucking customers are making a big deal about $2 on a $126 bill even though we fucked up and shouldn't have charged them for it.\" where said customers can see you doing it.

What happened: 

We went there for Father's Day dinner. I ordered the Chile Verde (which was actually pretty good) and I got two four-inch tortillas to accompany my huge plateful of pork, beans, rice, and other fixings.

To give you an idea of the scale I am talking about: imagine going to Subway and ordering a footlong, getting all your favorite fixings, and then at the end having your sandwich artist (yes, what they do is an art, don't downplay that shit) present you with a plate full of your fixings and then giving you two Ritz crackers.

I proceed to use my two tortillas to eat my meal. When I looked back at the huge remainder of my entree, I realized, \"This is what it feels like to throw rocks at a tank.\"

Remembering that ON THE MENU ITSELF stated that extra tortillas were on the house for any entree you purchased, I asked for more tortillas.

I got three more, used two, and packed the rest to go.

We finished our meals and our drinks, we for our bill. To my surprise they had charged me $2 for the three extra tiny tortillas. (Yes, I'm about to make a fuss about $2, deal with it)

USUALLY, $2 extra on a $126 bill would not be a big deal. I've worked in the restaurant industry long enough to know things get hectic and mistakes are made. Whatever. 

BUT when your menu itself says free extra tortillas and you set me up in a situation where I clearly need more, you don't go ahead and charge me for it. 

We mentioned it to our server, he talked to someone else (I'm assuming a shift manager) and then we proceeded to see the shift manager demonstrate the universal body language for, \"Are you kidding me? I hate my job\" you know, the one where you put your hand over your face, tilt your face down, and wish you were never born. 

To be absolutely fair I've made this gesture countless times when I worked in restaurants, but I made damn sure nobody saw me do it. Spoiler alert: we sometimes talk shit about customers in the kitchen*...sorry, it gets us through a long day. 

*BUT, if the customer was clearly in the right and I was their server, I don't care what happened, I owned it and apologized to them as it was my fault for not overseeing it since I am their only direct contact to the restaurant. 

Our server comes back a while later and tells me that:

1) I should've gotten three instead of two to begin with (you're kidding...one whole extra tiny tortilla?!) and

2) apologizes because someone in the kitchen told him to charge us for the extra three (despite the menu saying otherwise). 

We paid, left, and I'm not going back again. 

NOW, here is what SHOULD gave happened:

1) I order my huge plate of pretty good food
2) I run out of tortillas, I ask for more, I get more per the menu specifications
3) I mistakenly get charged for the extras, our server takes care of it, our server takes responsibility for it instead of shifting the blame, apologizes, and I leave a happy customer that will return. 

TL;DR

Making a fuss about $2 on a $126 bill is ridiculous, I know. But when the restaurant is 100% in error of the charge it becomes a matter of principle and you as the restaurant fix it. 

When you falter on principles then you are letting the terrorists win. Why? Because 'Merica, that's why. (Insert glorious Bald Eagle squawking the first line to the Star Spangled Banner)

When a customer gives inexplicable evidence that your restaurant made a mistake, own it, take care of it, and leave out the \"Fuck these guys\" attitude (or at least do it in the kitchen like every other restaurant)

If I had to justify the single star I gave them, I guess if gave to say the pork was pretty well done and the sauce was very good."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  this place is AMAAZING! Friendly people amazing food!! My friend and I shared elotepapas. MUST HAVE! Tacos!  another MUST HAVE! They also make the guacamole in front of you which is really good with their chips!! Definitely coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Finally an Arizona restaurant that knows there is more to Mexican cuisine than that coming from Sonora through Texas.  My wife and I went there today primarily because we saw the words \"Mexico City\" in a write-up.  What a pleasant surprise.  Walking in we were in a bright, cheerful, uncrowded dining area.  Our waiter encouraged questions about menu items and he knew the answers.  My wife ordered Chiles En Nogada and I had Cochinita Pibil.  Both dishes were wonderful (and we will have more than ample amount for lunch tomorrow).  Our home owners association is going there next week.  You bet we will be with them!"}
{"text":"If you like a different twist on your Mexican food this is probably a good choice for you. But if you prefer more mainstream Mexican food like I do, its not a great choice. Our service was very good so if you like their food its a 4-5 and if you are like me its a 3. Great location, parking and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The seating is horrible... The service was even worse.  It feels like they are geared more for Take Out.  There was enough staff but no one seemed to know what to do... aka refill my Tea glass / take my order / and the no silverware thing again.  2 of the 3 things I ordered from their menu, they were out of (Mole and a dessert).  Then the waiter tried to talk me into another dish by saying it was his favorite.  Will never go back!  Sucky experience!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas/ cocktails, wait staff was A+, family friendly relaxed atmosphere, vegetarian options are limited,
Highlights Lymon y coco, Huevo con Chorizo,Cochinita Pibil, Barrio Pollo"}
{"text":"This place is far below the standards set by Barrio Cafe. We have been here three times and the food is underwhelming and the service downright bad.

We enjoy Barrio Cafe so have given this place three chances and each has been worse than the prior visit. In our latest trip we had three servers each of whom seemed confused and untrained. The first person shows up and asks if we have questions about the menu and then -- when we ask a few -- tells us he cannot answer them because he is new and needs to get someone else. The next server then takes our order and proceeds to be oblivious as our entrees show up (about an hour after order) ten minutes before the guacamole and chips appetizer shows up. He was not aware of this though as he was apparently too busy standing around ignoring the few tables he was tending. He then disappears and we get a third server who insists he take our plates when we are still eating multiple times until we have to tell him to go away. The staff seems untrained and not to care at all. 

As to the food it is by no means bad but far from what you expect from Barrio Cafe's management team. The tacos (we ordered several flank steak and vegetarian ones)   are tiny, tasteless and overpriced. The guacamole appetizer was a small portion of avocado overloaded with salt and with a handful of (overly fried) hard as a rock chips. The chicken mole burrito was OK. The best item was the kids steak and corn dishes.

Go to Barrio Cafe, or anywhere else, and ignore this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food and service. Their Valentines menu was thoughtfully prepared and wonderfully served. The filet with Cabernet sauce should be a regular item on the menu. Hugo is attentive to all the guests and does a great job of describing the specials for the evening. Great place for a romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had!  I got the traditional Chiles en Nogada and it was amazing. Sweet and savory, fresh, and very authentic."}
{"text":"The food was great and the ambience was lively! Great Chicano testaurant offering a look into great art and authentic food! 

The enchiladas bistec were a great choice. Our server, Fernando, was also very helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this little gem during restaurant week and still can't stop talking about it! The entire meal was an adventure of flavors in just the right portions to leave us satisfied, but not overly stuffed. Very lively atmosphere with a wait staff that's quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place while walking around the 5th Avenue shops and loved their set up and service! I enjoyed the warm greetings and customer service Barrio Queen provided. My server (forgot his name-sorry) was an excellent provider for recommending me a few great treats from their menu. If you visit this place make sure to take advantage of their 3 for $10 gourmet tacos! I of course had 4 tacos, the dip and their top shelf Margarita!"}
{"text":"I can understand why Barrio Queen has such a following... it's a fun place in a great location. I just didn't think the food was all that wonderful. The salsa struck me as watery and odd. The tacos -- I got a variety -- were OK, but I definitely have had better (including at Blanco at Biltmore Fashion Park). I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Waiter was Sean and we probably ranks in the top worst service that I've ever had at a restaurant. 

It was not even busy at all and our waiter messed up our drinks/appetizers and took over 35 minute before we ended up with our first drinks which one was incorrect. We got up to get our own napkins since he couldn't get those to the table and it took over 75 minutes to get food at the table for 4 people! Chips & Salsa were not kept full and of course we needed them since we were sitting for so long with empty glasses of everything. 

End of the night we ended up without the guacamole we ordered and not even trying to get another drink because of how long it took to get anything! $145 bill for 4 dinners and 7 margaritas. Food was only okay but service was horrible! I highly recommend staying away from this place so that hopefully they can go out of business and a better place can move in."}
{"text":"The things that were good here were really great, but the things that needed work really could use some improvement.

The tableside guac was so good (that pomegranate!) and I already want more. My margarita (La Brava) was spicy and tasty. We got tacos, and the brisket was incredible- moist and flavorful.

However, the other tacos did not fare so well. The carnitas and the carne asada were overcooked. The flavors were good, but the meat was dry. It was disappointing, especially considering the strength of the other items.

The outside seating was lovely and our server was very attentive. Despite its shortcomings, I would give it another try because I really like a lot of what it's doing."}
{"text":"We had a great experience the other night. We were there for taco Tuesday had great food, chips and salsa were awesome and we had margaritas which were wonderful and were very impressed with our bartender whose name is Luke. He is friendly personable and works very hard."}
{"text":"Although the wait was long, it was worth it! The food was phenomenal, the best enchiladas I've ever had. I also loved the decor and the atmosphere!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here... Monday night, place was busy. Was greeted right away. Our waitress was very kind offered lots of advice to the food. Like they do not fry the chili relleno de vegetables and the drink Dia de Los Muertos was chili infused. I had the pollo deshebrado and the Oaxaca cheese was what gives this flavor. The carnitas taco was just ok little dry the rice was green? It had corn mixed in, not that impressive.  The sides, rice and beans are extra? Really? just throw that in with an entree. It took awhile for the drink to come, the waitress admitted she forgot to place the order. Sitting around waiting for dinner to arrive, I noticed the table in front of me had fancy drinks from the bar that were sitting getting watery from the ice instead of them drinking them, they opt for water? I'd come back and try again. I did love the T-shirts they sell and the cute stuff, day of the dead themed."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is one our regular favorite restaurants. I love the Pasole and the Michalada's. We always ask for Sherrie as our server because she is extremely knowledgable of the menu items and she is always happy and energetic...plus she is SO funny!!! Our favorite bartender is Victor. He's awesome! Great food, great atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"I'm glad that the more recent reviews are positive because this place is criminally underrated at 3 stars. Most of the complaints appear to center around the place being overly busy (really?) or the service being poor. While the service certainly wasn't fantastic-our waiter disappeared on occasion and came off as cold, though he warmed up as the night went on-I don't think it warrants dropping the star rating. Started with the guacamole, which is overpriced but excellent - chunks of avocado with pomegranate seeds, fig, and a few other fresh items thrown in for good measure. I ordered the street tacos and each one was better than the previous - got the conchinita pibil, suedo azteca(brisket), and salmon y mango. The brisket in particular was incredibly tender and flavorful. They are on the small side but also stuffed with filling so I was satisfied after 3. My wife and I also split a coffee press, which was some of the best coffee I have ever tasted and cost us $3 for about two cups each. So, while the food may be somewhat expensive for what get in terms of size, it's also fresh, flavorful, and unique."}
{"text":"Took the Mrs here after coming for a happy hour with friends. Dinner on a Tuesday night and it was pretty happening. What I enjoy is the decor and the great HH prices. $3 imports/$3 house margs! 

We started with an order of Mexican Style Fries Chile Verde. The chili pork is so good! 
We asked Ron, the server, what he would get. He quickly told us about the Pollo a la Coco and the Chiles en Nogada. 

The Chiles en nogada has apricots,pecans, golden raisins, onions, garlic, chicken, red wine all in a roasted poblano pepper. Served over a almond cream with a pomegranate garnish that will make you wanting more! The plate was small, but the flavors and richness made it special. 

Pollo a la Coco was a Pan seared spice-rubbed chicken breast topped with goat and menonita cheese, saute of onion and roasted peppers all in a piñon cream sauce that is just good! 

Next time we visit, I want the sample all the tacos or just a plate of the Chili Verde! 
Will be back with our pup and sit on the patio for sure."}
{"text":"The food is decent no doubt and when you dine in service is excellent. But if you order tacos to go beware. Not that Arizona is cold but in the winter it can get quite chilly outside. I went inside and one girl was nice and was going to get my food after I nodded yes it was cold outside but the other was like I'll meet you outside . Okay fine at least it's was sunny today. I ordered the chicken burrito and a taco. I asked for salsa since it was  a Mexican restaurant and I solely come for the salsa it's arizona there's Mexican food everywhere and was made to feel like I was inconveniencing her. Also she had inadequate knowledge of the salsa because what she gave me was incorrect. I asked for the spicy salsa and was given some green chili in a to go cup.  While I may dine in I will not order to go from barrio queen again the side taco shop is a bad joke that will make you regret your decision to have tacos unless you hate salsa"}
{"text":"Once was in the Barrio, now in the boardroom  fortunately.  I made it out, but the memories of where I came from and where I am have never left and remind me daily of the difference between success and failure. 

Before I go on too long, the bottom line is I would recommend taking a pass on Barrio Queen.  Prices are a bit steep based upon the quality and presentation of the food. 

I also found the staff a bit pretentious in asking if I wanted change from my $100.00 bill for a $52.00 check. 

I note this because conceptually Barrio Queen tries to make the right choices for the most part. but comes up a bit short, as in the narrow difference between success and failure. 

Barrio Queen is conveniently located.  When my wife, daughter and I dined the restaurant was clean with attractive decor and intriguing menu items.  The one issue I have though with \"trendy\" Mexican restaurants is the use of black beans and the omission of pinto or other types of beans historically consumed by natives of Mexico and Central America.  We were told by the server that the restaurant does not serve rice and only black beans true to native Mexico. 

I found that a bit odd based upon my knowledge, travel and consumption of Mexican and Latin American foods based upon many factors, including travel throughout Central and South America. 

I found the tacos to be decent but with no sauce to add to compliment the presentation and the guacamole to have 1/4 avocado size chunks (perhaps intentionally) with minimal flavor. 

The one thing Latin food should have is flavor.  Some of my best meals have been in dives and dumpy looking restaurants.  Unfortunately, Barrio Queen comes up short in the food category, beautiful setting but below average cuisine and certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"I read through the other reviews and I agree with the service being slow. However, the service was not bad, the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. This is a casual place with authentic homemade food, so you have to respect that things will take time. They have an outstanding tequila selection and the food was delicious. We had choriqueso for an appetizer- large portion, great for sharing, fresh chips and guacamole, one taco each ( street size, a la cart) and churros for dessert. We tried a couple of their margaritas- absolutely delicious!!!  It was great to see the Chef talking to every table and listening to customer feedback about the food. She mentioned that the menu is a bit overwhelming to those who are not familiar with the fare. I agree, but the descriptions of each item were perfect and the servers were very knowledgeable. it is truly a unique experience to dine at a place like this. 
I would like to try their happy hour so I can taste more items."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time visiting and I decided to try their tacos because they were recommended to me by a friend.  Their tacos are definitely not that great compared to the other restaurants in the area. I ordered the pescado asado, the camaron asado, and the carne asada. The pescado asado was pretty bland and it had the smallest piece of fish on it. The other two tacos were okay. All of the tacos were really small. 

The service here was terrible. I very rarely saw my server. He did not come to refill the water once. The service was also very slow. We had to wait a very long time to receive our food. When my friend and I were done eating I tried making eye contact to a server that was close by, but they just walked right passed me. It took us about another 5 minutes for another server to come by and we asked her if she could get us the check. 

The only good things I could say about this place was their chips and salsa were pretty good. Also, I loved the ambiance. I loved the murals on the wall. But if I were to come to the gilbert area to get tacos this definitely would not be the place I would go to. There are other places in the area with better tacos and way better service."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. Pollo Barillo (chicken burrito) was AMAZING!  Went with my sisters and mom for a girls trip.  The pork burrito was not very good. Table side guac wasn't the best I've had but it was ok.  The chips are larger, homemade--average.  Salsa was yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night and was greeted at the table with the announcement that margs and sangria were $2 off! Woo!! Enjoyed the good-sized glass of white sangria throughout the meal. 

We shared and enjoyed the table side guacamole that had pomegranate seeds! I've never had guac like that and it was delicious.  There could have been a little more for the price but it's still definitely a must order. 

I had 3 tacos- Barrio Pollo, Pescado, and some carnitas thing that my server recommended. The carnitas was flavorful, tender and moist. The Pescado was really light and crisp. 

We finished off by sharing churros.  Didn't expect it to be filled with caramel which was a yummy surprise but next time I need to stick to my guns and order the tres leche cake.  Favorite!!

Our server was attentive but not overly so, and was helpful with suggestions. Also, we're all obsessed with the decor.  I want their studded skull from the entrance in my house."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was mediocre - except the service which was excellent.  The food was definitely not anything memorable.  Not bad but not great.  I haven't been to the original Barrio in ages but, my memory says it is much better."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, came here for date night with my boyfriend and we loved it!"}
{"text":"Good food and very good service from Marlene - we will go back again - did not expect the décor to be as nice as it was - been in the venue in the past.  Food was different - not a big Mexican fan - so this was special - thank you."}
{"text":"Food was good. Margaritas were weak. Service was absolutely terrible - perhaps the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant. The party at the next table appeared to agree - they got up and left after ordering their dinner. I would never recommend this restaurant and will never go again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is delicious and authentic. Service is fast and the staff is very friendly.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Lovely patio
 Comfortable mister even in 90 degree pls temp! Pollo Coco was delicioso!!! Carne Asad burrito was really flavorful according to my son! Table side quac was also excellent and made to our requests. Our waiter, Devon, could not have been more attentive and friendly! Super dining experience. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Dined here when out of town since we were looking for a good Mexican place in a neat place to dine with our younger cousin. Barrio Queen it was!

Our dinner experience started out with us waiting a while for the waitress to come by. Long story short: good (albeit pricey) food, neat ambiance, AWFUL customer service. The latter is enough to make us never come back.

We ordered several entrees and one of almost every taco to share. Really good chips, salsa and guacamole. My favorite tacos were the nopales and rajas tacos - great for vegetarians and for gluten free people like myself. Their horchata was also really good - although $5 per glass is REALLY steep, even for Scottsdale standards.

After slow service but an otherwise pleasant meal, we gave our waitress our credit card to pay our check and that's when the %&*# hit the fan. We waited for over 20 minutes for them to come back with our credit card to no avail. It wasn't until we looked over and saw about 5 people with flash lights and knives in a commotion, including our waitress. When she saw us looking over, she finally came over and told us she lost our credit card since it had fallen and got knocked under a large generator behind a wall. Accidents happen, sure, and we would have been TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING  had she apologized and said they were trying to get it out, however the first thing that came out of her mouth was, \"so I'm sorry, I'm going to need another form of payment\" to which my husband responded he would like to pay with the credit card he gave her. She then became upset and said it was an accident, and got even more mad when we asked to speak with a manager. At this point we have been sitting there for over 30 minutes.

We were heading back home the next day and having to potentially cancel the credit card on which our rental car was on and flight would be a great inconvenience, and could not wrap our heads around how neither the manager nor the waitress thought this was a big deal or how they could not conceive why we were upset. They asked us to \"come back later\" as they continued to look for the card but asked that we put down another card for them to charge in case they did not get it out. In hindsight, we shouldnt have done this. After going down the street for some dessert they finally called us to come pick up our card. No apology again, no nothing. 

With so many good Mexican places in Scottsdale, no need to visit this place that seems to completely disregard customer service. First and last visit here - which is a bummer considering their food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Our hotel concierge recommended this place and it did not disappoint. BF had the Azteca enchiladas and I had the Azteca burrito. Both were very good. I didn't care for the red (mole) sauce but the green sauce was perfect. Even the chips and salsa were top notch. And service was amazingly fast even though it was packed.  If/when we're back in Scottsdale, Barrio Queen will be a must visit restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went there today and ordered a Tortas Carne Asada and I received a burrito filled with rice and one piece of pork. No flavor at all Even the salsa tasted like water. I waited an hour for the meal as well.  I guess they have their own animal farm in the back where they butcher it themselves and that's why it takes so long to prepare it all. Service was lack luster. Never again! The bar looked cool though."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and service. The tacos are to die for. The guacamole is perfection. The only minor issue is that it's so good it's always busy so immediate seating isn't always an option but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The best way to get acquainted with Barrio Queen is to visit on Taco Tuesday! You can order any of their 20 street tacos for only $2.50 each and they have a variety of drinks for $3 each, I'm in!  

I typically get 3 different tacos for a variety but can only ever finish about 2 of them fully.  I get the pollo, carne asada and chile relleno (it's delicious but very spicy so beware).  For the price the tacos are amazing, don't be afraid to experiment, after all they are only $2.50! 

The service is hit and miss depending on your server.  My favorite is Veronica, she is sooo sweet and knows the menu like the back of her hand.  She really makes the experience so much better.  

I have yet to try any entrees, I think the tacos are the best deal on the menu and i dont want to stray away from them.  It is interesting that the chips and salsa are $3, but if you are with a group, they amount to about $1, so just think of it that way! :) 

P.S. With the right server, you end up with bottomless chips and salsa so the money is well spent!"}
{"text":"We had a nice lunch here of carnitas tacos and a hot dog. My husband loved the hot dog, and after tasting it, I'd definitely order that myself. The tacos were good, although some might find them quite small, they were the perfect size for me. The homemade chips brought to the table were mostly good, but a few were still a bit soggy or greasy. The service was great, and they were very gracious when we asked to be moved inside as we were too cold on the patio. This.was our second weekday lunch here, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was beyond slow. The physical space and location are great, outdoor tables, nicely decorated. But unfortunately, the slow service and mediocre food just doesn't do it. A million choices on the taco bar but the ones we had just didn't measure up. The award winning Cochinita pibil?? Still not clear what award it won."}
{"text":"We went to Barrio Queen yesterday for lunch. The decor is really cool, and I liked the art work and old school barrio feeling. However, the dining experience overall was average. At the price point and with all the hype that Barrio Cafe gets, I was expecting more. We started with the Bloody Mary's - with no garnishes - as the the bartender told us he was out of them at the bar (but never went to the kitchen or asked other waitstaff for more. BTW - we were the only ones at the bar). 

We moved from the bar outside to the patio where we ordered guacamole. It was basically 8 chips and two tablespoons of guac on a tiny salad plate - not sized to share for an appetizer in my opinion. The menu was extensive and taco \"sushi-style\" menu was cool but pricey. We went instead with the carnitas burrito. It was drier than expected and lacked flavor. It sure doesn't stand up to the carnitas burritos at America's Taco Shop or Gallo Blanco. 

I hope this restaurant improves as it is a nice addition to the Scottsdale waterfront area. But we unfortunately won't be rushing back or recommending it."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. Only been here for lunch, but we've always had a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food good service. Once they got their act together after their initial opening they are as good as their Phoenix locations."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. First of all, my plate wasn't clean.  It had caked on food on it.  Then to the food:  The salsa was good but the tortilla chips were the thick, extremely hard kind and I felt like my teeth were gonna break.  For an appetizer we ordered Vasito de Elote, which is fresh grilled corn cut from the cob, served in a cup, topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, Valentina hot sauce, cilantro, and lime.  It was delicious, but a very small portion.  Then my bf ordered Chile Verde which is slow cooked pork with garlic, onion, peppers and tomatillos served with flour tortillas.  He was very pleased and after having a little bit, I agree that it was delicious.  On to my choice which was the California enchiladas.  They're basic cheese enchiladas and I had them served with calabicitas and rice.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't very good either.  The rice was bland.  It's hard to explain what was wrong with the enchiladas.  They were simple cheese enchiladas but not very cheesy and red enchilada sauce poured over the outside.  Just not cohesive, I guess is the best way to put it.  The best thing this place had going for it is that it was a beautiful day here in February and the patio had delightful ambiance."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaraunt experiance I have ever had. We a long time for a table due to having 10 people for a birthday dinner. Instead of pushing tables together to accommodate our group, they made us wait for over an hour for one specific table. Keep in mind it is only a Thursday night. There were many, many people who came in well after we did and all were seated before us. By the time we were seated we all knew what we wanted and immediately ordered our food. It still took an hour and a half for us to get served. We also had to send dishes back for not being cooked thourghly and being cold in the middle. When we asked to speak to the manager it was clear that he was just talking to us because he had to and really did not care at all about our experiance. If you are looking for a nice relaxing dinner with good service and food, go elsewhere! I would have rather had taco bell."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and drinks. Great atmosphere and music. Would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town, and our hotel recommended this restaurant. We absolutely loved it! The service was exceptional (Ask for Marcos!), the food was delicious, and they make their own margarita base (YUM)!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant since it was new and had  other successful locations. Well, once you get seated it is a 5 star restaurant.  The problem is getting seated. The night we went was Taco Tuesday...understanding this we new there would be a wait. 1 of 8 girls at the hostess stand said it would be 45 minute
 wait...we arrived at 5pm.  There was nowhere to sit and wait.  We watched 3 tables inside and 3 tables sit ready to go for 15 minutes....really?.....also there was a 6 seat table that sat empty and 1 of of the hostesses said it was reserved for the owner....we saw the mgr. and asked him and he said no way.  My point with the restaurant is the food is great but they need to figure out the seating situation....what a mess"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive....table side guacamole was the highlight for us tonight...the rest not so much. Our issues started with the hostess, we walked up with the understanding there will be a wait (Sat night & busy shopping complex), she showed no enthusiasm and acted as if she was challenging us with over an hour wait. No prob, waited, enjoyed a house margarita (pretty good). Actual wait 40 min, sat down and unfortunately was greeted by a server who could care less...unenthusiastic, no emotion just clearly going through motions. We had questions since it was our first visit, which were answered. Now for food....al pastor and carne asada tacos (good flavor), but very small portions for price. Carnitas tacos were awful, fatty bland meat. They were out of several beer selections offered on menu as well refried beans(uh ok?). Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay, I've never made it over to Barrio Cafe, so I can't make a comparison.  But this place stands out on it's own.  I had the Arizona Burrito which was filled with pork and not too many toppings.  The highlight was a side order of the Barrio Papas that had the corn, goat cheese, salsa, etc.  That easily could have been my meal and I would have been happy with that.  Barrio Queen's Mexican food is good high end food, but let's not forget, low end taco shops have very good Mexican food too."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were great! The mole enchiladas are the bomb diggity, too!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed sangria was the worst thing ever .. But tacos were good .. Price is fair and decor is nice . Not the best Mexican food for Arizona"}
{"text":"For years I've been hearing about this place so I headed over there for happy hour today. I ordered the pork tinga appetizer and a delicious house margarita that was mostly ice, but a great drink. I would've given them 5 stars until I spotted the green stuff growing out of the oil on my chips. I showed my server who brought some guy over to discuss this. He offered me a free dessert and it was great. I didn't think much more about it until now when my stomach is upset and I'm wondering what was on those chips. I hope the health department checks them out."}
{"text":"Ate recently at both the Barrio Queen in Scottsdale and at the one in Gilbert, and enjoyed both very much.  Loved the pollo en mole and the carnitas, and liked the chili en nogada; wasn't such a fan of the carne asada.  The margaritas are terrific, and the service is great.  Like the ambiente, too.  Fun place.  And pretty authentic, too (although I'd never had cranberries in chili en nogada before; they made a decent substitute for pomegranate, though)."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Try the guacamole and sample a few different tacos. But...the server could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"The menudo was as good as my Grandma Rose's! If you like menudo here is the place to get it good!"}
{"text":"I loved, LOVED, LOVED this restaurant on our mini-vaca to Scottsdale.  We went twice, it was so great.  The first time, the service was OKAY, but the second night was the best.  Margaritas are my favorite and the happy hour menu is delicious.  I didn't like the guacamole, but everything else was delicious.  I will definitely be going back.  The decorations and vibe were awesome."}
{"text":"I really like the tacos. But the cochinita pibil is just okay. I had been here several times and  I just had one bad experience at the bar, I went by myself and two guys behind the counter didn't seem to want to help out. They even helped other people that arrived later before me and I think it was so wrong because they looked at me and talked to each other in Spanish and didn't want to take my order.
The rest of the times was good! But that was kind of a sad experience."}
{"text":"Man, I was stoked to try this place and really disappointed with my first visit.  The decor is awesome and the bar is comfortable.  Unfortunately we sat at the bar for nearly 10 minutes before we could even get a drink menu. The bar staff was nice enough but they certainly didn't convey the same kind of friendly service that we're used to in Gilbert.  The skinny cholla margaritas were great but served in a small glass FULL of ice and definitely not worth $9!  It was over an hour from the time we walked in, sat and the bar and were seated versus their estimate of 35 minutes.  We had time so that wasn't a huge deal.  The food was pretty good, but definitely not worth the price.  We had 2 margaritas, guacamole, ceviche, one taco and the carnitas plate and our bill was over $80 with tip!  All in all, the place is cool, the vibe is right and the menu is right but the prices are WAY too high for what you get.  There are a lot of options in Gilbert that offer great food for a reasonable price with friendly staff that are genuinely pleased to serve you.  Hopefully Barrio Queen can make the adjustments to their menu and their people to become a better fit for Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"We tried a variety of tacos here (3 for $10). Tacos were all unique and tasty, but the 
Suadero Azteca (queen's special) was the standout. It was incredibly flavorful and tender and was topped with really yummy veggies. Definitely get your own of this if you are sharing. The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too. This is a great place to try inventive tacos, but can get a little pricey. I think you need to ask for chips and salsa here, as they didn't bring us any without us asking, but once brought, it was tasty :)"}
{"text":"We're here now!  What a great place to celebrate Labor Day. Lacy B. Is our bartender and she is great. 

Awesome shrimp ceviche and barrio papas. 

Fantastic day and great people here a the Barrio Queen!  We'll be back very very soon."}
{"text":"California enchilada was THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Work with a cop who said I had to visit this place when I went to AZ and he was sooooo right.  Went to school in Texas so I thought I'd tried some really good enchiladas, but these are my new faves.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Decent, but not even close to the original barrio. Expect bad service"}
{"text":"So happy we have a nearby Mexican Restaurant with such a dedication to its heritage / craft. Great atmosphere, ambiance. Great presentation and serving sizes. Margarita size could be a shade bigger or with less ice but that being said, great cocktails. 
Would have easily given a 5 star but the bar service was a bit lacking. We got great service table side but had a hard time at bar, getting the attention of bartender because she was behind the center register talking with a large group of servers etc. Walked by me while I had my hand raised several times without eye contact despite being well after lunch rush and with several empty stools. That being said, great attitude, so good the fact that we had to flag somebody down to get silverware to eat our meal with didn't really affect a great meal. I believe the staff is still getting their feet on the ground and will improve with time. The effort is professionalism is obviously a goal, I overall highly recommend making this a regular on your local dinner rotation."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it! Guacamole table side is the best choice. I wish they would tell you it comes with pomegranates because to me that is the bets ingredient, they don't because \"it's only seasonal\" so hopefully when you all go it'll be in season....

Street tacos are really great and salsa is bomb. Chips warm and fresh, service always great. Love the location and vibes. Jeff my fave Mexican"}
{"text":"Not real impressed with our dinner last night around 6:30. The service was great but everything else was disappointing.

My mom and I ordered margaritas and tacos. The server claimed the shrimp tacos were \"amazing\" so I ordered 3... they delivered 2 shrimp and 1 fish taco. The shrimp tacos were average, the fish one was a little better. My mom said her tacos (beef, chicken, and fish) were \"OK, but there are other restaurants in the area with much better ones \" and I agree.

The small margaritas are packed with ice and not much drink for the money. Although I have had other restaurants' jalapeno margaritas that are are spicy and delicious, this one burned my throat and had a bad aftertaste.

Someone came by and asked \"how is your meal, and how do you like that jalapeno margarita?\" She did not introduce herself (so rude) so I have no idea who she was. I smiled and said, \"the margarita is a little too hot for my taste.\" She disagreed and then walked away! She obviously did not care about my opinion... why did she even ask???

Our server was very attentive and pleasant but considering my order was wrong and the food was mediocre, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Tue is $2.50 taco night. They have lots of interesting choices. I had two beef, a chicken & chorizo and a vegetarian one with cactus and a fried egg on top. All were good. Tacos were very small (which seems to be a thing in scottsdale ... I had the same experience at The Mission). I didn't know that when i ordered. I probably coud have eaten 6. The biggest downside was that it took about 40 min from when I ordered till I got my food. Gotta knock you for that."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of drinks and tasty food.  The decor is fun and the place appeared clean.  Service was great and the food was very tasty and left me wanting more!

It left me wanting more because the portions were small, especially for the prices they charge for the food.  The tacos were something like $3.50 - $4.00 range and based on the size seemed like they should be maybe 75 cents.  

All in all:  Good food, but it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to spot for some great Mexican. Love the enchiladas and tacos and the guac is awesome. Go on taco Tuesday to really get a great deal. Love coming here on a regular basis and service is always solid."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, delicious fresh agua frescas, lots of menu choices, excellent service.  We had the mushroom loaded queso and it wasn't our favorite.  My carne asada sandwich was amazing however and my mom loved her shrimp enchilada.  Will definitely be returning to try more!  Looking forward to trying their plethora of tacos"}
{"text":"Wow!  So delicious- we tried 6 different tacos all were great and distinctly different. We will have to return and eat our way through the menu!  Most adventurous Mexican restaurant I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I was hungry for Enchiladas so we stumbled upon Barrio Queen. Plentiful free parking in downtown Scottsdale, so that was a plus. I asked the waiter about their enchiladas and he steered me toward the Carne Asada enchiladas which featured both green and red sauces (ended up sort of brown-ish when mixed). The flavors were excellent! Excellent service and the patio experience was great. I wasn't a big fan of the decor, but that's not why I was there anyway, so no biggie.  I'd hit them up again if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"Been here once for drinks and tacos. The drinks were tasty and they have a good selection of tequila. The food was ok as the meat was a little dry from over cooking. The staff was nice and pleasent."}
{"text":"Food was very good but service is terrible. We sat for 5 minutes before anyone spoke to us let alone delivered water. This was not for lack of staff as it was Wednesday at 5:00 and there were almost as many employees as patrons. Place has been around long enough to work through the kinks. That said, Desert Ridge is starved for decent Mexican food so Barrio Queen won't likely feel the pain enough to attempt to improve."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for the type of food they serve.  Staff was not friendly, waiter spoke minimal English, not your typical Mexican Restaurant.  Would not make a crispy taco shell, soup served with a teaspoon and flies galore due to large open bar with no air blower.   Surprised to see the Boss in an adjacent dining room doing paper work.  He would of benefited from asking customers for feedback.  I give it six months."}
{"text":"Sherrie was amazing always love the food and service. We will see you next Margarita Monday."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in the southwest, I was really hoping to experience an authentic Mexican restaurant.  This place isn't it by a long shot. Let's start with the service, I was served by someone bubbly and kind but it wasn't timely or accurate service.  The food, bland! Quite bland. It wasn't spicy or flavorful at all. I give this place a three because I liked the ambiance and the drinks."}
{"text":"Well, turns out the other yelpers were not lying about the service. Ugh. It's really too bad, because we really loved the food. I'm guessing management has read all the poor reviews regarding service, so perhaps this is just their shtick? 

We had to ask for water twice (our margaritas were served promptly tho), had to ask for chips and salsa twice, and when finally delivered we only got chips. We asked for salsa and the server looked at us like we had just asked for a side of chopped up puppy. I mean, really? Don't chips and salsa go hand and hand? And aren't chips and salsa supposed to arrive before the food? And then of course we had to ask and wait for silverware. These are super basic requests, met with looks of disdain from the staff. 

I really want them to get it together and figure out their service issues, because I really want to eat that awesome food again."}
{"text":"The food is good and I like the atmosphere.  Drinks also tasty but expensive.

I liked this place better when the weren't so uppity and offered chips and salsa. 

Our waiter said 'we don't have chips anymore' but then shortly afterwards the table next to us had chips sitting on the table.  It was very frustrating.

I guess you 'can' get chips if  you order the $10 table guacamole, but what if you don't like guacamole??  Maybe this place it just to 'trendy' for me...

I just get tired of every place in Scottsdale trying to be 'haute cuisine' and usually failing.  How about some regular 'good food'..."}
{"text":"Service was average salsas were very watery the food tasted good however it was served room temperature, all entrees. When we asked for them to be heated they were put under the broiler and brought back without being re-plated and unfortunately not much warmer than before. I will say however the manager did come over for his apologies and they did offered desserts and provide a discount on the bill. Unfortunately with their prices and experiences in totality we will unlikely return."}
{"text":"Great, trendy place for a sit down Mexican meal. Cheap margaritas too! Service was very friendly and efficient. They want to make sure you are happy! I would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Good, honest Mexican food.  Generous portions, great bar selection for beer and cocktails.  Our server was hilarious.  Good spot for groups and kids, casual dress.  Ceviche was great, carnitas familia was satisfying!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time on  May 23rd for Taco Tuesday. My son and I sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party. They have a great selection of craft margaritas that we enjoyed. I had the Dia De Los Muertos and the La Brava. Both were excellent.  I asked the bartender about moving to a high top table and she put our name in and moved us over as soon as it came available.  The tacos are $2.50 on Tuesdays so we were able to sample several different varieties.  They are street style so a little small but high quality and a value at $2.50. They also have a late night happy hour starting at 9pm featuring reduced price tequilas and margaritas.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place & the outside patio is great. Awesome wet style burritos & authentic flavors.

If you are into margaritas they do offer happy hour, discounted drinks & appetizers. Only reason I didn't give 5 Stars is the beer selection, I am an advocate of craft beer & they only have the basic corporate beer. If they offered local beer on tap this place would be perfect. Try the Azteca & Arizona Burrito! & a tequila flight!"}
{"text":"The theme for our meal was bland and soggy. Ordered the carne asada burrito and the cochinita pibil torta. Food city and Sprouts both have better, more flavorful carne asada and the tortilla was mushy and flavorless. The cochinita pibil was also lacking any flavor and the bun was soggy, even when it first arrived at the table. The fries with the torta were undercooked and soggy. We piled up our soggy torta and tortilla on a separate plate and our server said the sogginess was from the juices. Nothing was that juicy though. The skinny chola, however, was a pretty tasty margarita. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend of mine and dined on the patio on Saturday night.  We had such a great time!  The tacos were so fresh and delicious, as well as the table-side guacamole with pomegranate seeds.  I had the Al Pastor tacos (a personal favorite of mine), and they were fantastic.  I can't wait to go in for their Taco Tuesday to try more!"}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent, different but still within the \"mexican\" genre and not polluted by other cultural ideas.  Good job maintaining yet improving an already high performing food breed."}
{"text":"I was recommended  to come  by on Tuesday for tacos . Not sure if our waitress was tired from a long shift .but we wete never given silverware we had to ask more than once for them and napkins .we had a table for 4 and added two more maybe that was the reason for the lackluster service received . We also noticed That maybe it was because we were not Caucasian that our service was not  that great .seems  like the tables with the Caucasian  had silverware and faster service .The young lady  who sat us and took our reservation was great and the bus boys were on there game . I was disappointed  because  I am  latino and expected a bit more but I will give it another chance just with a male waiter.work on your wait staff ."}
{"text":"Great Tacos, authentic and a lot of variety.  The guacamole is also amazing.  Sit outside if you can, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off...I'm not a food snob so this review will be pretty simple. I thought this spot was reasonably priced and had great food. The tacos tasted great and they have a wide selection of drinks. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Excellant service and delicious food. Id definately recommend it. Wonderful atomsphere"}
{"text":"It should not take nearly 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waitress or get chips and salsa. She also got part of the order wrong. Salsa and and the food was all bland. Not again"}
{"text":"Tables side guacamole is a must. The pomegranate seeds were a great touch. Azteca enchiladas were fabulous. Churros were complimentary to the food. Courtney walked us through each course to make sure we ordered the best choices!"}
{"text":"Greeted by a friendly wait staff, and whisked away to a patio seat.  The patio is great for people watching or just enjoying the sunshine.  Table side guacamole, can't get any better than that.  One can taste the freshness in all dishes from carne asada to the cochinita pibil pork.  The meat and vegetables complement each other very well."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  A pitcher of Margaritas. The guacamole is not what you might expect, but REALLY good. Carnitas, fajitas, enchiladas...amazing sauces, unique appetizers..indoor or outdoor dining. Service good, could be better. Take a walk along the waterfront after dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time last week. Our experience didn't start off so well, as we waited close to 10 minutes to be acknowledged by one of the bartenders who both seemed to be ignoring the 6 or 7 other people at the bar and were both working the well. After finally being greeted, we waited another 5 minutes for our drinks. 15 minutes for two beers is a little much! 
However, things got better when we were seated. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. We ordered the corn appetizer and table side guacamole. The guacamole was delicious, but I wouldn't order the corn again. To be fair, I was expecting it to be as good as a similar corn dish served at the Elote Cafe in Sedona, but it didn't come close. We ordered about 5-6 tacos from the taco menu which I would give an overall rating of a 7. The unusual ingredients and combinations were fun, but I thought the overall execution was just ok. I'll be back for the guacamole though."}
{"text":"1 of the best in the area! Great taste, good service, well made drinks! If you like shrimp get the entree CAMARONES AL MOJO DE AJO! Plenty of seating inside and out and overall good vibes and decor"}
{"text":"The service is awful.  Drinks go unfilled.  Bar drinks are forgotten.  They are slow to take the order.  I think the kitchen does a good job as the food is really great and arrives promptly after the servers finally decide to take the order.  As the food is fresh and flavorful and the menu is varied, perhaps the management should simply fire most of the front of the house and start over?  The exception to this is the host staff that were pleasant and did their job well.  If you go there definitely get the table side guacamole.  It is wonderful!  We tried several different tacos and they were all outstanding."}
{"text":"If you're trying to find the place you will notice the skull on the building, that may be what was left of the last person while they were waiting for their meal! We arrived at 5 on a weeknight.  We were seated right away however it was well over an hour before we received our food. Water glasses and chip trays were bone dry despite multiple efforts to track staff down we even had to get up and go get them. Attracted the attention of a manager to speak with him said he would be there, never showed up. Kids ordered kids chicken tenders of which the only dipping sauce was ketchup no Ranch was available. We ordered a burger and tacos the burger was dry and an exceptionally small portion for the price. Tacos were cold.  Staff could not identify  which tacos were on which plate left us to guess.   We  have visited other locations though overpriced for quantity and quality they were at least reasonable.  If you were looking for a North Scottsdale crowd and a margarita or alcohol then this is probably the place for you certainly not a place to bring a family and our kids are teenagers. Not a place for a quick bite or a reasonably priced meal"}
{"text":"Our server Roberto was excellent and Savanna the host was darling! Myself and 12 others dinned in at this location a couple weeks ago. There was an hour wait inside, however outside was immediate seating. Bearing the heat, my family and I decided to sit outside. Roberto was very attentive and the nachos chingones were out of this world! My wife ordered the barrio pollo and raved about the combination of flavors! Savanna was consistently refilling our waters (when it's 115 degrees out, plenty of refills are needed)  and taking our dirty plates away. It seemed as if Roberto was busy with other tables however Savanna was there to help when needed. Overall experience was great! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place needs some major training!!!  I have gone to the location in Old Town Scottsdale and have always been happy.  My husband and I decided to try this one in Gilbert for Valentine's Day and it was horrible.  The hostess had no idea how long the wait would be.  Told us 15 mins- ended up way longer.  Then when we got seated, it took several minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there.  Finally, the server came and took our order.   30 minutes later, still no food and two couples that had come in after us were already eating!
So we ask and the server lets us know that we got stuck behind a big party and that our food would be out in just a minute.  Finally the food arrives and it's the wrong order!  So she apologizes, can't find our order and has us re-order!   The manager comes over and tries to apologize and asks us if we want anything...  20 minutes later, the food finally comes.  We were there for over 2 1/2 hrs!  They did comp our meal but then the server let us know she had payed for some of it!  WHAT?!  OH geez, now I feel bad.  There is no organization, the hostess and the server seemed very confused at what they were doing and the manager should have followed up before we left."}
{"text":"What a great place, the atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly, overall is fabulous! I love that there is a wide variety of tacos and the best part...they are sold individually. I can't alway finish a whole meal by myself at a restaurant, the portions are so large. I had the option to get just two tacos. Oh and of course when going to a Mexican restaurant there are chips and salsa, absolutely delicious! The chips and salsa are almost the deciding factor. Happy Hour is great prices and great choices. This is a great place to stop for Happy Hour drinks and chips and salsa. I had a margarita and two carne asade tacos, very very good. The only downfall was that it took awhile for us to get our checks but we did have 11 checks just at one table so it's pretty understanding. The overall experience was very pleasing I will definitely be returning to enjoy more great drinks and food"}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite restaurant! It started off bad when they brought the chips and salsa. The chips where thick and the salsa didn't have much flavor. I ordered two tacos, pork and beef and both were pretty dry. My husband ordered the chicken burrito and it had more flavor but still wasn't great."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this restaurant to open for weeks and went in today for lunch and happy hour, needless to say it was well worth the wait. We got multiple drinks which included a sangria, the house margarita and at $25 margarita that I don't recall the name of. Our bartender Anthony was fantastic our drinks were delicious, and he explained the day of the dead theme of the restaurant. For food we got their pomegranate guacamole and Anthony even made it for us on the side of the bar, we then got some of the happy hour food which was all again delicious. We will be back every week and very excited for their day of the dead party. 

I highly recommend eating here for can be considered pricy however the flavors match the price and make sure to eat at the bar!"}
{"text":"Table side guacamole was fantastic. The tacos were good, but two out of three were cold when served to me. I got grilled fish, veggie and pollo. The pollo was the one I liked best and the only one that was warm. We had a wonderful server. Happy hour margaritas were a good deal."}
{"text":"Great food!  The restaurant has a nice patio.  Their happy hour is great.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We got there at 6:06 PM on Thursday nightWhich is the slowest night of the week in downtown Gilbert. We got seated right away but didn't get our drinks until about 15 minutes later. We ordered our food when we got our drinks which took another 30 minutes to come to our table. During that time our drinks were empty or chips and salsa or empty. Our server although a very nice lady was not very attentive it all. The manager actually walked by and I think he saw me looking at yelp was the only reason he came up to me assess it we need anything. I food came out it was OK at best overpriced for what it was.  My wife had Carne Asada tacos I had the Carne Asada burrito and my son had chicken nuggets  off the kids menu. I don't see why it took over 30 minutes to get our food we will not be coming back anytime soon hopefully their service picks up."}
{"text":"fun atmosphere with unique guacamole topped with pomegranate but probably not worth $12. i had  3 little tacos for $10 and they were decent. my boyfriend had a huge carne asada burrito which was delicious"}
{"text":"Very good location, good music, decent food. BUT ... the service is very very bad. The bartenders (specially the one with the bangs) when you are waiting they are so rude. They say they are a full bar but limited. As far as I know a full bar is a full bar. They do not carry Absolute and they do not have olives. This restaurant is surrounded for many good restaurants.  This restaurant will go out of business soon, if they do not train the employees. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"The most amazing Mexican food that you can have in Phoenix.  Since the ratings on Yelp...the restaurant now has a sushi style taco menu...along with their main entree menus...The service is exceptional, staff is so friendly and family oriented, positive and amazing atmosphere...Please take a chance on this place...b/c it is amazing!! The chef/owner has brought something so unique and golden to Scottsdale...We have been telling anyone and everyone...this is the PLACE!!!  Try their happy hour during the week and weekend!!!"}
{"text":"As a Jersey Boy...no sugar coating...I speak right between the eyes...

Now...Start to finish on Barrio Queen at Desert Ridge ...
If you like those thick chips and very bland salsa...good because that's what your gonna get and I had to ask a waiter for them.

My family I all love Street Tacos but let's start with the drinks...
8 bucks for a weak, over-iced house margarita...please...I asked for light ice...and got more...I told the waiter...no reaction, so I went to beer.

As for the tacos...when hungry they go down...but the authentic Mexican flavors are not there...
Service in general seems very disorganized..
Love the art work and Day of the Dead Glasses and Mugs for sale...but we're there for great Mexican food & drink and at a fair price...right?
Now...there is a killer Taco Spot in downtown Phx that I will drive twice as far for street tacos and real drinks from now on...oh...what Taco place do I mean?...I get into YES...you will get my spot for this and other restaurants and businesses."}
{"text":"I do like this place.  Great tacos lots of variety. Love their chips, thick and homemade.  Today went for a couple barrio pollo tacos and a carne asada with chorizo.  Great service tonight as well."}
{"text":"Great food here.  The Chiles en Nogada as seen on Food Network is by far the best thing on the menu.  The Conchinita Pibil (pork) is also good but would recommend the Chiles en Nogada.  They also have a lighter color Mole that is tasty.

We always get the guacamole when we come here as it's made right in front of you and excellent. 

Don't just order a taco or burrito here, the specialty menu items are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"i've been to barrio cafe a biz-zillion times---always love it.  have drank many margaritas, eaten loads of their awesome guac, amazing dishes.  i always assumed barrio queen was just barrio with an old-town-scottsdale twist. but, no. it doesn't deserve to have the barrio name. 

on the menu, their guac \"looks\" to be the same one they serve in barrio cafe.  but it was so tasteless, i barely touched it.  i also barely touched the margarita!  (i know---who barely touches a margarita!) when the waiter pushed me to say why i wasn't consuming it quick enough, i finally said \"its a bit too sweet for my taste.\" by that i really meant \"it tastes like it has a boatload of sugar in it.\"  his response was \"next time don't be cheap and spend more money on the margarita with better tequila.\" first, wtf?  second, i wasn't complaining about the alcohol---i was complaining about what they did with the alcohol. 

the main course was much lower quality than barrio cafe.  the seafood was served raw.  (no, i did not order ceviche.)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Food was great.  Everything came out as ordered and the GM Josh Hecke came out to see how everything was going.  Would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"When you want a gourmet taco, go to Barrio Queen. The black beans are amazing! Taco Tuesday is a perfect day to go."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it was recommended by a good friend. I went there around 2:30 so it wasn't very busy. When I said it would just be me dining alone they recommended I sit at the bar. Strike 1. I ordered a special marguerita instead of the house happy hour deal. That was great and the reason I gave 2 stars. I also ordered the 'renown' guacamole which is supposed to be made tableside ... but of course since I was not at a table they just brought it to the bar. Strike 2   It was 14.00 for a relatively small bowl of guacamole and it was so spiced up with jalapeño peppers I could barely eat it. Strike 3. I did not stay for tacos."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever..not only the service was bad but the food was even worst. ..
My bill was over 120...for that kind of service and food next time I prefer to cook at home....salsa was horrible  not taste at all ...tacos only had a tiny camaron and was full of cabage menu do was so spicy that we could  not eat and the waiter not even once went to our table to give us drinks....
There are lots of people working there but it feels that no one is in charge...
Very disappointed. ..
Not a good place to eat at all...."}
{"text":"Sherrie was our server and it was a great experience! It was my first time at Barrio Queen and I will be back for sure! Happy cinco de mayo!"}
{"text":"What can I say? ICE COLD BEER & TACOS? Outstanding! The churros were the cherry on top. 

Also....the service in the Scottsdale location could use a lesson in manners and service from the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"I would come back, food is awesome! Their take on Mexican food is not your average Mexican refried beans and burrito place. Service is friendly and prices are good."}
{"text":"A few tips:  DON'T get the Chiles en Nogado if you are hungry.  Literally 5 BITES of chicken, NOT a chicken breast.  That worked out to $5.00 each bite for this $20.00 entree.  Also, it would be nice if the sides had been hot or even warm when served.  The chipotle mash wash just chipotle and no other flavor.  The calabacitas was more onion than anything.  My lunch partner's bass looked great but the server tried her best to take the plate I had the fish on that my lunch partner shared since my $20 plate was so very skimpy.  As well, there must have been a rule about leaving chips on the table even though the appetizers ($10.75 for guacamole?  really?).  The cevhiche was pretty soupy with hard chunks of avocado and needed seasoning. Finally, watch your ticket closely or you will be charged for 14 drinks for the person sitting is space 1 who had 4 drinks.  This was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times I left saying \"it was just okay.\" 

On my most recent visit with three other friends, we went for happy hour. Two friends got a margarita and said they were good. I ordered the chile relleno with vegetables and a side of potatoes. I think the best way to describe it is that the flavors weren't melded together - the chile was full of vegetables, and it was really spicy, but it wasn't really a cohesive taste. It also lacked any cheese, which was pretty disappointing in a relleno. It was basically a bowl of intensely spicy (like four glasses of water spicy) chopped vegetables, kind of a ratatouille that I finished eating with the chips at the table. The potatoes were good at helping to cool down the spice. I don't mean to sound like a gringo with the spice, but it was really intense and unenjoyable.

Our service was okay - it was the beginning of a busy Friday night but our server wasn't very attentive, I had to ask for refills multiple times, he brought me the wrong side even though he helped me pick it out, he just didn't seem interested in helping us. After two \"meh\" visits, I'll look elsewhere for Mexican food in Old Town."}
{"text":"Good happy hour - green chile pappas were wonderful - carnitas, carne asada tacos perfect - do not hesitate to go.  Service was friendly and prompt.  will return"}
{"text":"We called 2 days ahead to ask if we could get a reservation. They do not do reservations. We were told that they do allow call ahead seating up to 2 hours before you arrive with a group. We called 2 hours before and were told that our name was taken and they would be ready for us. 2 hours later we arrived and no one knew anything about our \"call-ahead\" seating...The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.

I spoke to a manager who got us in as quickly as possible but the wait was still long considering they had promised us preferred access when we arrived.

We were told that the guacamole was a can't miss menu item...it was ok. 1 avocado and some other ingredients was hardly enough for the group to have more than 2 bites each and at $11, certainly not worth the money.

I ordered 4 tacos for the main course. They arrived on a plate that looked like your average run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant serving plate except there was a huge open space on the plate...like there should have been rice and beans but it didn't come with them...?!?

The whole meal took over 3 hours and the waiter rarely came back to the table.
I thought maybe this was just a bad experience, so we tried it again about a week later. Same result.

Like some other reviewers, I really wanted to like this restaurant and I am excited about all of the new eateries popping up in downtown Gilbert. Unfortunately, I would not recommend Barrio Queen to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome Street Tacos and Flan.  Wait Staff Jose and Marco were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great food!! We had a slim time slot in order to eat and was able to find two seats at the bar where the staff was so nice and quick to order our food and drinks. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"5-star all the way.... Everything we order was delicious!!! We had the elote as an appetizer and it was really good.  The house margarita was really tasty! I had the enchiladas suizas and they were finger-licking good!!! And the flan... O M G !!!!  Hands-down to the chef!!  i will definetely go back without a question"}
{"text":"Came to Barrio Queen yesterday for the first time for dinner 9pm and was told that the wait was over 2 hrs long. Several other people were saying that the hostesses has no concept of wait time and at least four other parties left before us. After several attempts to find open tables we left and went to another restaurant, fifteen minutes later we get a text that our table is ready at Barrio Queen. Unbelievable!!!!!!! Hire the right people or lose business."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I usually visit this place about once every two weeks. We have had everything from the sandwiches to the tacos, burritos even the rice and beans are great! I would recommend this place to everyone. We have eaten outside, the inside and even the bar. Service is great all around. I have to commend the bartenders though, my hat off to them, not only do they have to service the people sitting at the  bar but they have to make all drinks for the restaurant! Great work Cory, Dakota and Heather!!! Hands in the air!! Woop Woop!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here, had seen great reviews. The hosts was a very unhelpful and didn't support her own restaurant. Told me i could google a place to go get drink while I waited instead of showing me to the one of the two bars located in the restaurant. Which I find bizarre coming from someone in the service industry. The wait was longer than expected, which I understand but when we arrived back no apology for the wait. Once seated we noticed a big back bar that could of been perfect while we waited but we didn't know this being from out of town. I brought everything up, as I think I would want to know if something like this happens at my restaurant and the waiter offer our waters to go. At the same time he kept offering to buy the table next to us drinks if anything didn't turn out well. I will never come back to this place and don't recommend."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and atmosphere. Great bar to eat at   Desi is lots of fun and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Would leave zero stars if I could. Just came in here at 10 PM and the hostess was rude telling us the kitchen closes in 30 minutes and asked if we still wanted to sit, even though they didn't close for another hour. After sitting down we sat for about 15 minutes waiting for someone to come up to us. We watched as about 6 or 7 servers walk around all looking at us but no one helping us out. Finally I just got up and asked a sever if we can just get a to go order and the lady apologized and asked if we wanted to sit yet she blatantly saw us sitting there with no one helping us. I've come here 2 other times and the service is just never great. It was my sisters first time here and I literally told her that the service here has never been great and they clearly did not disappoint. Will not come back and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Service was amazing. Our waitress was really nice! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for the first time as it was recommended to us by a friend while we were visiting from Dallas. I must say, this place is awesome! The atmosphere, the service, the food! It was all great! Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Ok, so we just ate there today and met Nomas who was the best waiter we have had in a very long time. He was entertaining and very knowledgeable about the food. His artistic skills also great as his art  is decorated throughout the place. We met the artist El Heffe whom we bought his artwork. Now down to the food, just so you all understand how far we go to rate a restaurant, here is the list of food our party of 5 ate, 

White Sangria (pitcher)
Red Sangria (pitcher)
Queen Shrimp x 2 - group fav
Aguacate y Camaron x 2

Tacos:
Carnitas
Cochinita Pibil -- group favorite
Suadero Azteca
Carne Asada, Huitlacoche y Champinon - group favorite

Tres Leches ok not awesome
Horchata I mean really good
Flan really good

I will say this about everything, you can't go wrong. My personal favorite, the queen shrimp man it was just heaven for me and the desserts.......

I will visit Barrio Café on the way back to NY since it is in the airport and post that review."}
{"text":"I was visiting my rents from Ohio.  My dad recommended the place and its was fantastic.  Authentic ingredients. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and they added some great fruits to the mix! Burritos was fantastic and filling! Muchos Gracias!"}
{"text":"We came on Friday around 11:30am for lunch. Of course the food was phenomenal! The decor and ambiance was amazing! And the server was great and knowledgeable! More than I can say for the manager on duty. He was rude to staff and didn't know anything about the menu! It was super awkward to reach out to management and come up empty handed!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal with some friend and the service from Sherrie was outstanding.   Looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing staff! Perfect location! However,  the GM at the Gilbert location really needs to understand that the customer pays his salary, so he may want to learn how to value and respect them!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! Atmosphere, staff, and food are great. Defiantly going again and again."}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas but wait a month before you come because they are totally disorganized."}
{"text":"Food was good, but unfortunately we had a very poor experience on the service side. After receiving our check, I put down my credit card for payment. A few minutes later, the waitress came by to tell us that she managed to lose my credit card. Apparently she dropped it, and kicked it under a panel in the wall, and it was trapped underneath a huge radiator or some other machine inside the wall. 

Before I could even respond, she said \"we're going to need another form of payment.\" They were still hoping to find the card, and people were actively trying to get it, but all she seemed to care about was getting me to pay a different way. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry that you may have to cancel your credit card now,\" no \"sorry this is a huge hassle and annoyance,\" just basically asking me to plop down another card or pay cash. When I explained that I'd like to use the card I already gave them, she copped an attitude and said \"well it was an accident\" in a not-so-nice way. Yeah, I get that, but an apology would be nice... I was pretty annoyed at this point and asked to speak with a manager. The manager didn't seem to be much better either. They did not sympathize with the fact that this could end up being a huge annoyance for me (for example, I am from out of town, and I had the hotel and rental car booked to that very same card). There was no offer of a free meal, a comped drink, or anything. 

Rather than cause a big scene, I eventually relented and gave them another card. We left the restaurant with the original card still in limbo. I planned on canceling it that night. The restaurant called about 30 minutes later saying they managed to find the card. When I went back, there was no apology for the hassle of coming all the way back. The manager seemed to just want to get me out of there as fast as possible. Mission accomplished I guess.

Prior to this, I have never in my life declined to leave a tip for a server. This was the first time. My mother used to be a waitress, and I know how hard of a job it can be. Even when the service is poor, I still tip. But in this case, I felt that the $15 I would have tipped would at least help pay for some of the mess. I would have been totally understanding if they were apologetic and nice about it, but everybody seemed more worried that I'd try to skip out on the check or something."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food place I've ever been to! A little pricey but you can't find flavor like this anywhere else that I've found."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here when I sit at the bar.... but I went in today at lunch for a Valentine's thing and we sat at our table for 18 minutes without any servers approaching us while we watched everyone else get served.  I used to love this place but not so much now."}
{"text":"The food, while hailed as the best Mexican in the valley is decent at best. My friends and I probably would have enjoyed the meal more if there hadn't been GIANT cockroaches crawling all over the outdoor seating area. Weaving in and out of our feet and crawling into the general restaurant when servers opened the door. The servers were definitely aware of the problem, with our server going as far as to crush one with his foot and say \"He's gone now\". Something about giant roaches and squashed bug bodies next to the table ruined our appetite. Really completely inexcusable and should be immediately addressed by the health department."}
{"text":"A warm welcome and an excellent Margherita heralded a good evening. Especially loved their guacamole which was made at the table and included cranberries! Never had that before.The rest of the meal was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Much easier to get a table here than at Barrio Cafe, and the food was very good. I had the mariscos relleno and it was delicious - only a little spicy with a tasty sauce and plenty of crab and shrimp stuffing. The mashed potatoes were delicious, but I could do without the calabacitas (veggies). The carnitas were lean enough for a very picky eater and the tortillas looked great - he ate them all before I got a chance to snag one."}
{"text":"On Sunday my fiance and I went to eat here after a friend of mine recommended this place to us. We were there as soon as it opened and decided to sit at the bar. We witnessed how the male manager on shift that early afternoon started yelling at 2 other employees. He was awfully disrespectful and made us feel so uncomfortable that we ended up leaving. As working human beings ourselves we do not appreciate companies who treat their employees in such a disrespectful way."}
{"text":"\"Hostess\" April was completely rude to the point we almost walked out from the start. We asked if we could sit outside and she said there wasn't a table when indeed there was but it was dirty. Asked if she could have it cleaned and she said, \" I was planning on it\". Then, proceeded to tell us it would be a 20 min wait, the place was dead. Finally after we sat down, we waited and waited for a fairly lengthy time before our sever appeared. He was pleasant enough but service and follow up was horrible, actually beyond horrible. Food was mediocre and drinks were small, weak and expensive. This was our second time here, first time they had just opened so obviously on their best behaviour. We won't ever go back, ever. There are much better choices like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the patio and our waiter. Wonderful! I ordered the Enchilada Suiza , my sister ordered the Enchilada with shredded beef and my other sister ordered street tacos and black beans. The table is set with salsa and chips to start and we ordered wine as well. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful with our menu questions."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly people but, very mediocre Mexican food.

The location is awesome, right in the thriving downtown area of Gilbert.  The people working there were very friendly and attentive. 

Now, let's get to the food. :-( 
The chips were okay.  I little thick for my preference but, that's a personal thing. 

The salsa wasn't very bland.  I like a little kick, not super hot but, I definitely like flavor, this lacked both. 

The Table-side guacamole wasn't good at all.  They use ONE avocado and really didn't season it well (been to other places where they use 2 to 3 avocados and add some great seasoning) AND charged $11 for it!

I got the 3 tacos for $10.  They warned, several times, that they were small \"street tacos\". The size wasn't an issue, they were fair size for street tacos. The presentation looked great.  However, there was almost no flavor in the two Al Pastor tacos.  Al Pastor is one of my FAVORITE tacos and when restaurants have them I usually get it.  This was NOT flavorful at all.  And again, no kick. I also got the Shrimp Asado taco.  It was noting to right home about. 

Lastly, I got the side of black beans.  I have had better flavor from \"canned\" black beans.  

Again, great location, great people and it seemed to have a nice bar inside but, if you want good Mexican food there are WAY better places."}
{"text":"The happy hour is a really good deal.  We enjoyed delicious $4 house margaritas, the stuffed poblano pepper, and the puerco verde bowl and left stuffed for a bargain price.  Robert at the bar was fantastic, and very knowledgeable about tequilas."}
{"text":"The staff are not properly managed which makes for an unpleasant experience. We thought we were the only ones invisible. We had to ask for a server to take our drink orders then we asked about chips and salsa and we're told you have to ask for it. Other patrons were served did before their appetizers. One unfortunate gentleman ended up being invisible as well as we watched him ask 5 TIMES for a server. I wound give then a 1 but the food was good."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Arizona we felt like Mexican food.  We came across this gem of a restaurant.  It is located in a gorgeous strip mall.  The restaurant is large as well is the outdoor seating.  Even on a cold night it's nice outside with the heaters on.  The menu is very ethnic with a large menu.  They are famous for their street taco and have a lot to choose from.  I had the carnitas, steak and chicken tacos.  All were full of flavor and had the perfect spice.  They make guacamole table side with pomegranate seeds in it something I've never seen!"}
{"text":"Food was totally not what I expected. Too expensive for how it even taste. Total let down especially for the name and the atmosphere being a good one and catchy. The food just wasn't good at all. Disappointed :("}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Scottsdale for the weekend. We were shocked by the lack of good Mexican food but decided to try a sit down option and found Barrio Queen. The atmosphere is fun. Very eclectic but festive. The table side guac was good but hardly guacamole - more like an avocado salsa. It still had great flavor. I ordered the suiza enchiladas. Too much congealed cheese for my liking. Lots of oils and other unidentifiable liquids on my plate. Even though our waitress was pleasant and attentive, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, this isn't working.  We tried a variety of dishes from the menu and nothing was more than meh.  Barely there, uninspired and overpriced for quality and quantity.  Plus, our server was one of those folks that maybe should be working in computers, not hospitality.  Beautiful patio, too bad the food doesn't measure up.  That said, we tried Barrio Cafe at the airport and had a rockin' meal with great, albeit slightly wack, service.  Quality control folks or maybe the Scottsdale crowd just doesn't know the difference :)..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time here and my husband's first. He is hesitant to try new restaurants but he really enjoyed Barrio Queen. We had the strawberry/pina agua frecsa to drink and it was amazing. For appetizer we shared the barrio papas topped with elote, which were great. The hubby ordered the Pollo en Mole Poblano. He couldn't stop raving about it. I had three tacos which were just ok but the one that stood out was the carne asada chorizo azul. We had the flan for dessert and it was good. I love the look and theme of this restaurant. Our server tonight was Lisa and she was really nice and helpful. I always appreciate great service because it's hard to find these days. So thank you Lisa! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Place was really busy when we came. Took some time to sit but all and all a good restaurant. Food prices a little high  quality was their thou. I would like to go back but try out their happy hour instead."}
{"text":"Margaritas are always good, however service is not. The food is also way overrated. I don't like the restaurant lay out. My fiancé for some reason really likes this place, but I always suggest we go to other places when feeling like Mexican food... So we do. I am the boss after all lol"}
{"text":"So,  my wife and I had an evening to ourselves which doesn't happen to often with our busy lives.  Barrio Queen was our choice!  After being seated we were passed over for some minutes.  Upon hearing that,  Manager Phillip immediately came to our table to assist us.  To start , he comped an appetizer  and then our entire meal as well!  He was extremely professional,  polite and personable!  We were very satisfied with his generosity! But wait,  upon hearing that my wife had saved a small portion of her meal for our daughter to sample Manager Phillip brought  out a full portion  to take home to our daughter!  Manager Phillip absolutely went above and beyond customer service! Incidentally,  the food was Great! ! Kudos to Manager  Phillip and Thank You once again! !Lee and Sandy"}
{"text":"FABULOUS! OMG! Looking forward to taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The kitchen service was horrible. We got there at around 5 p.m. and decided to order at the bar because there was a wait for a table. We each ordered the healthy choice tacos....how simple is that? Well, after waiting a half hour for our food the bartender went to check on it. She came back and told us they were \"out of some things,\" but were on it. Out of things at 5 p.m.? The tacos finally arrived. I have to say that Joy Ride is much, much better. Barrio Queen is sooooo overrated. The service in Scottsdale is actually worse. We will NOT go back to either place. Gilbert, you can do better!"}
{"text":"We chose barrio queen to celebrate a birthday.  We arrived and I told the waiter it was my gf birthday (without her present) and he offered flan. We then ordered table side guacamole. I ordered 2 tacos. The waiter was nice and attentive enough. The guacamole with cranberry was delicious and I love their chips.  Well then the tacos arrived.  The tacos were SOO small (the rim of a drinking glass approx). They were served on a small appetizer plate with no side. We didn't expect it, especially for 350 each. You would think the waiter would give some guidance to inform new patrons of the size and/or recommend a side with the meal.  We were told after the fact \"they're street tacos\". The food was definitely tasty but underwhelming and we left hungry. I can go to several places for same taste, authenticity, same price and not feel hungry when I leave.  After the meal, the waiter brought the check, no flan, no birthday wishes, no mention to the fact of my request when we first arrived. Will I return? Nope."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for tacos and quality margaritas.  Good service and Great patio that is dog friendly.

Great location in the middle of the foot traffic in  downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stopped at Barrio Queen with friends for a few drinks and some apps Saturday.  Very impressed with the Cerviche and their fries w/ pork and cheese.  

Also had the skinny Margaritas which were very tasty, but very small and expensive in comparison to similar restaurants.

Followed this with an awesome Chili Rellano taco.  Great selection of street tacos, and great decor, too.  Service was a little suspect with long waits for drinks and visits from our server.  

All in all a good dining option, but bigger Margaritas or lower prices coupled with more attentive service can definitely earn them another star.  None the less I'll go back, and recommend you visit them."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is horrible. 
The table side guacamole is awesome, especially with the pomegranate in it... Surprisingly ! 
The only downfall to this place is that they are horribly slow and not at all attentive to their tables. We kept running out of water and trying to catch someone's attention was near impossible."}
{"text":"Idk why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. This place is sooo good. The food is good, my service was good, and the tables in the side rooms are spread out enough that I feel comfortable taking my baby in there. My aunt and uncle also love this place. This is like the only REAL Mexican in Arizona."}
{"text":"Angel was a wonderful server, he was quick and super nice. Lunch was awesome good thing we live close!"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful tacos (recommend the chicken and chorizo as well as the pork house specialty taco). Huge thumbs up for the calabasitas as well!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would on the food and the wait time.  We came at 4:30 on a Sunday and was told it would be an hour wait when there was clearly many tables available.  Once we were seated the only good thing was our waitress Cassie E.  She obviously knew what she was doing.  If I could make one recommendation she should get a job someplace else. The food lacked flavor. Especially the guacamole.  The only thing I'd give 5 stars on is the pressed coffee.   Oh yeah by the way there was a bus boy that looked like this was the worst job he's ever had.  Yawning and walking around like the most unenthusiastic person I've ever seen. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today for the first time. I've had excellent experience at Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, and I realize this is different chef/owner, but I had heard they had similar menu. Waiter was very nice. Chips, salsa and guac very good. Should have stopped there. Had 3 tacos--carne asada (no flavor, grey in color, just blah); cochinita pibil--huge chunk of pork that was actually tough--didn't know you could do that with braised meats! It was topped with pickled red onion, but the onion on my taco included a chunk of the root of the onion (yuck!), and pescado asado (grilled fish), which was chewy--didn't know you could do that to fish! Sides of black beans tasted like they came straight out of can with the liquid in the can. A tiny sprinkle of cotija cannot hide that fact. Word of advice--scale down your choices dramatically. Make a few taco options, make them fresh, and make them well."}
{"text":"I would never go here again and would never recommend this place to anyone. The staff were rude an unfriendly - I could maybe understand if the restaurant was full and busy but there were only a few other tables besides our family... When our food got to us the portion and quantities were small compare to the price and the food was not good - average if not sub par. My red sauce tasted chef boyardee so I could't even finish half of my food. Really not a great experience and it's a shame is fallen in the heart of an awesome district."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner.  Everything was done very well and the Margaritas were excellent.  Big thank you to our server, Daniel H."}
{"text":"OK, let's start from the beginning. I claim to be a Mexican food expert, so it's hard to impress me, specially outside Mexico. 

So I've been refusing to visit this place for ever since I'm tired of trying Mexican places that claim to be authentic and are just overpriced lame imitations.

But since today I was in a great mood and wanted to try something new (and had to eat in the Scottsdale area) I finally gave this place a try. 

The service was super friendly, on top of their game and pretty knowledgeable. Five stars for the service!

The food was great in general, but let me go dish by dish.

1. Guacamole. Well, it's not authentic but it's tasteful. The cranberries or whatever they put are unnecessary and mine was on the spicy side, which I appreciated but not everybody likes it so be careful.

 2. Chips. Super tasteful, thicker than normal.

3. Steak taco. Mmmm, nobody would miss it if you skip this taco.

4. Suadero. Not 100% authentic but pretty tasteful.

5. Al pastor. Nothing to do with the real thing. Can easily be skipped unless you don't care if it's a freestyle pork taco which tasted ok.

The tacos are medium-small.

6. Cochinita pibil. This was the highlight of the night. Pretty close to the real thing, great taste. Will go back for that for sure!

7. Shrip Barrio. Open quesadilla with shrimp. Tasteful and different.

8. Shrip with avocado. Meh.

9. Tres leches. Again, not authentic and barely OK.

10. Flan. Delicious.

11. Agua de horchata. The real deal. Super tasteful!

Bonus. I asked for a sample of the mole. It was well executed, thick, tasteful. A little in the bitter side, but again, mole can be cooked in thousands of ways. I definitely will try a mole dish soon.

Price was fair. Not cheap, not expensive.

Great decoration!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Tacos were medicore at best. Corn tortillas came out soggy , had to eat tacos with a fork. Very skimpy on meat overpriced. Tea was good,  just dont eat here.  D- on food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My server and all the other servers were very nice with a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back and it was packed. The hostest were extremely rude and couldn't give an adequate time frame for a table. It was pulling teeth to get a drink for my toddler while we waited, not once did they offer to give us water In the heat.
Finally were sat and the service was rushed and lacked personality. Sadly, the food is overpriced for the length of wait and the lack of customer service. Used to love coming here but will not anymore!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant as travelers from Portland, having been raised in California, looking for a decent Mexican meal. However, we were on foot and none of the four-star restaurants were in reach, so we decided on the lovely outdoor patio of Barrio Queen.

I concur with the 3.5-star rating. If I only had the chips, salsa and guacamole and my Margarita Brava (jalapeño-infused), it would have been a 4-star. Unfortunately, I selected the Queso do Cabra salad as a healthy complement to my indulgence. I liked the mixed greens, which were fresh. The idea of the roasted corn and poblanos was a good one, but the vinaigrette was bitter and didn't go with the salad and the goat cheese seemed like an afterthought. My husband had three tacos, which he said were good and are definitely more the direction you want to go if you visit Barrio Queen.

Their patio is lovely and there is a lot of foot traffic nearby and few cars, so ambiance was a definite plus. Service was good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely lunch and afternoon at an outside table on recent trip to Phoenix.  The menu was extensive & offered some incredible combinations.  Found the Margaritas to be terriffic, reasonably priced & our food choices were fantastic.  Service was good....I'd strongly recommend Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials.  Good food, go for the stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere to eat outside is great.  The food is on-point, but I cannot stand the help.  It is consistently bad.  I've eaten here at least 10 times in the last 6 months, and every single time it is poor.  Go to the Gilbert location for the same food, not quite as good of atmosphere, but way better service."}
{"text":"This place does its best to replicate the Hispanic culture, food and beverage that Mexico provides.
       The wide assortment of tequilas, tacos and Mexican dishes entices one to return for a second time. The experience of authenticity is carried further by the music and colorful art surrounding the restaurant. Furthermore, the absence of cheddar cheese on the menu lets one know that this place tries hard to authenticate what Mexican food is really all about; flavor deriving from a multitude of ingredients. 
          Four stars goes to this restaurant despite its mediocre rating because there are surprisingly so few of these places around Arizona!"}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday. I wanted a shrimp burrito and they don't make one. I was going to order the shrimp enchilada instead.  Our sweet waitress asked the chef if he would do a burrito with shrimp. He came over and was very pleasant and not bothered by my pickiness.  We designed a great, simple burrito.  Our food was fresh, delicious and filling. I don't recommend always ordering off the menu. But I love how they stepped up to accommodate. It was well worth the money and generous tip."}
{"text":"I'm a lover of Mexican food so I thought I'd give it a try since I live in Downtown Gilbert.
Atmosphere was great, service was good but the food wasn't even worth rating. The chips and salsa had an ok flavor but the rest of the food was flavorless.
The three stars were definitely for the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"We have to go back in a smaller group so we can focus more on the food, but our food on a relatively busy Art-Walk evening was really good.  Most notable, however, was the service.  We ordered drinks at the bar for what we thought would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated quickly and carried our drinks to the table.  The staff picked right up and moved our group of 8 talkative people right into appetizers and then entrees.  They were patient, attentive, friendly and extremely helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Rereviewing after a few months away.   Not out to auspicious start due to poor treatment and bad attitude by the hostess.  Not particularly crowded with many open tables,  still 20 minute wait.  No problem since beautiful evening.  When 20 minutes became 25 or 30 without getting a table,  when we asked about the table we were greeted rudely and with disdain.  Since our visit was to introduce friends newly to the area.  Hope to recover throughout dinner. ..had to get our own place settings after 20 minutes and following appetizers....

The food is the saving grace.  Upgraded the rating from 2 stars to 3."}
{"text":"Food was good. Beer was cold and Chantal is an excellent waitress. She was very friendly and makes sure you are taken care of!!"}
{"text":"Wow! It's hard to find truly authentic Mexican food in a nice atmosphere so this place was a winner all around! The carnitas are phenomenal and they don't skimp on portions at all. The mole was top class and all the sides (chips, salsa, rice, beans) were very fresh. El Don was a great margarita to wash it all down. Excellent service by Pablo as well. Get there early! We came at 5:45 and were seated by 6:15, but by the time we left, people who were waiting with us hadn't been seated yet."}
{"text":"Got a $14 chile relleno (vegan so just veggies) and that's ALL you get for $14!!! A huge plate with a tiny veggie chile relleno in the middle and a small side of beans. I expected a full meal for that price. 

Also ordered 2 veggie tacos. They were fine in terms of taste but it was literally only 4 bites worth! They use the tiny corn tortillas. For $3.50 each I would save $1 and come on taco Tuesday. 

Table side guac is 1 avocado with tons of tomatoes for $10. 

Save your money and go down the street to Joyride Taco Shop. Waaaaaay better food for the $$$!  This place is a rip off for mediocre mexican food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a date. Both of us left behind 2 full plates of food because it was so gross. I was most surprised that the waiter didn't ask why he was throwing away So much food.  He had the queue to say \"is everything okay?\" But he didn't (which is poor service, if you ask me). I let her choose the restaurant but I knew 100% it would be gross because Barrio Café is also no Bueno. Overrated. At least the restaurants are consistent. I hate nothing more than wasting food and money. The relationship didn't work out and neither did this restaurant. I would choose Taco Bell before this place any day."}
{"text":"The food is very affordable. Typically I would've ordered the street taco style tacos but I decided to branch out. I got the chicken mole enchilada and my wife got the \"arizona\" which is a pork wet burrito. Neither were very good. We sat and ate at the bar, service was good. I also ordered a very spicy drink from the drink menu, it was decent and served in a pretty cool looking skull glass. I wouldn't go back for the food, fun environment though, so maybe for a drink."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio Queen a few times. I usually get the Arizona burrito. It's good and consistent. This was my first time to this location. The food is Somewhat overpriced. I still prefer Barrio Cafe in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is so good maxican food. It's tasty and looking good and delicious. I'll come for more. And super drinks not to forget."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Server was very polite! However, I am a huge beer fanatic. I'm not too crazy for margaritas or sangrias seeing how many places can hit or miss the mark on the drink. Many places do not balance the right amount of juice (or other beverage) with the right amount of liquor. Sadly, here was one of those places. Tried a margarita just for kicks, and it was extremely sweet. It gave me an instant headache. So I decided to get a beer instead. It's Mexican food, so it is mostly beer within that theme. However, it was very disappointing that they only had Dos Equis and Corona and Modelo. And only one bottled IPA beer. I get they want to keep in the theme and that's great, but possibly a few more beers to the selection and you would have more happy customers. Although the food is great, next time I will go to another place with a better drink selection. But if you are looking more for great food and you like that selection of beer, it's still worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner last night as had been interested in trying one of the Barrio restaurants for quite awhile. The restaurant has a nicely shaded patio which was great to be able to sit outside in June! Really enjoyed the guacamole made table side as it had the cranberries that really gave it a twist!

Servicewise?? Beers took forever to get to the table and once delivered, were incorrect. The patio misters were on full blast and by the time we left, the back of my shirt  and my head was soaked with water. I have never blow dried my head at a restaurant before but cant say that now! Several tables made mention of the heavy mist that was to go off at 8p but we were still in a London fog a 815pm.

The chicken burrito was good but I rushed through it so I could leave and dry off. Guess we should have changed tables and moved inside but not all of us were getting the free shower and that was never offered to us."}
{"text":"Really bad experience all around.    We got sat in the main dining room and about 10 minutes later a pompous \"Assistant Manager\" came and said he has to move us becasue the hostess sat us in a reserved table (the place was pretty dead).   We got sat in the bar area and the air condition was on full blast making it freezing cold.  It took twenty minutes to get a drink order *(which we ordered at our first table,  our apps actually came out before we had our drinks and they didn't even offer us water.  I had 6 differnet tacos,  3 were really good and three were horrible.  The least you could do if you move a group once they've been seated is apologize, maybe offer to buy them a drink, and make sure the rest of their dining experience is enjoyable.  I have a feeling that there will be another restaurant in it's place soon if they don't get their act together."}
{"text":"First off i have to say that I love the food and environment at Barrio Queen. Whenever I get in there I always have a great time sitting in or outside. The reason why I am rating Barrio Queen 3 stars is because of the wait! Now I know this place can get very busy because of how popular it is but most nights there is only one hostess managing a huge crowd of people outside.
Everytime I go there we are quoted from 45 minutes to an hour. Ok that's fine my boyfriend and usually just walk around and look in stores and wait. Now it has never been during that time frame.  It has either been 15 minutes (yaaaa!) Or 2+ hours....Honestly we never know what we are going to get so we always put our name down at another restaurant and see which one comes up first. 
The nights that we have gone have really needed at least 2 people manage the hostess job.  What has happened in the last two times we have gone is that the hostess tells us that she might have a seat for us. So instead of writing our names down she is going to look and for us to stand off on the side. Now when she leaves there is just a random line of people waiting and newcomers anxious to get their name on the list. By the time she is coming back she is getting trampled by people just showing up to get those name on the list. Without talking to the people in line she adds newcomers names to the list and by the time she gets back to us the wait has now increased 45+ minutes.  This situation  will happen each time she checks a table or seats someone....

It is just crazy sometimes and I have probably only been able to eat there about 1/2 the times I have went to eat there."}
{"text":"I've been the Phoenix location and had a wonderful Experiance. This location is even better.

I always order a Michelada and the Nagada dish with chicken, apricot and almonds. Perfect potion and a flavor you haven't tasted at any Mexican restaurant.

The guacamole is made table side and has a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. Absolutely appropriate and adds a crunch to the dish. 

This is NOT your ordinary mexican restaurant. This is a a restaurant and a meal fit for a Queen... A Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"15 minutes and no waier/waitress while seated outside in 95 degree weather. Eventually got up and complained to the manager and he promptly reseated me at the bar and found me a waitress absolutely a great job. I also received a free margarita and guacamole appetizer. Total redeemed themselves."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The services was awful. The waitress kept ignoring us and seemed mad at us for no reason. For instance, when I asked for more chips she just walked away without saying anything and never brought us extra chips. I would signal for attention and she would just pretend she didn't notice us. 

I finally got irritated and stood up to talk to her, and only then did she finally go up to me and pretend to be nice.  

Also, the food did not impress me at all. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Treated like trash at this place. Had my family with me, young kids. The waiter, completely ignored me and only would speak with my wife. Why? No idea. Did he think she was interested in him or he would get lucky? 
After waiting a long time just to get some water and chips, we ordered the overpriced guacamole which seems to be a favorite dish there. The waiter was disgusted that we wanted that. He tried convincing us to buy the nachos instead. He lowered his head, sighed and said he would make us guacamole. He had no desire to make it. Threw in minimal ingredients and served it to us without stirring ingredients together, the avocado was lumpy and there was no taste to it.
After he stared at my wife's chest for a while, we ordered food and the house margaritas. Food was bland at best, no seasoning or correct spices, bitter. The margaritas were so strong it numbs you from the horrible food your eating. 
Truly I think Taco Bell is a much classier place with better food than this dump. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Diego's! Now that's a great Mexican  food restaurant."}
{"text":"I think I need to stop eating at and reviewing \"Mexican\" restaurants in North Phoenix. A friend and I went for Happy Hour and ordered wine and three appetizers. We enjoyed our wine however, the appetizers proved to be barely edible. We got the fatty pork stuff with the goopy cheese in a pot, the dried out chicken quesadilla sized for a toddler, and the less-than-average-chicken taquitos. The ambiance was lovely (which I gave THE stars for) and our waiter was attentive enough but I can't imagine people really enjoy the food? My friend and I both avoided the food after our first bites and were both trying to be polite. At the end we both broke down and agreed the food was too awful to eat."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times and are usually pleased with our experience.

Great happy hour offerings and tasty guacamole, prepared table side. The menu has some good options for vegetarians and even a few vegan selections. Tasty tacos (go on taco Tuesday!) and a ton of different margaritas! Staff is always super friendly and willing to answer my (annoying) veg questions:) 

I like going here because the food always tastes quite fresh and even during busy times, we are served quickly.*






*Except for one time when it took forever for us to be served at the bar. Buuuuut it seemed that they were severely understaffed at the time (I think it was a margarita Monday or something). There were piles of dishes needing to be taken back to the dish pit and the service well was full of dirty glasses. I felt bad for the bartenders because there were only two of them and they were slammed. No manger presence on the floor which seemed a bit odd, given the lack of staff."}
{"text":"Love Barrio Queen, great food, great drinks. Happy hour is awesome! We have always had attentive staff... very authentic Mexican food, and hands down the BEST margaritas! One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"The chips and Horchata was amazing. The tacos were good.  Napolitas was too spicy for me but had great flavor."}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday. 
The atmosphere was great
Our waiter was very attentive and helpful especially with the menu.
Our drinks were delicious 
Our food was VERY good. 
I'd definitely make the 20min drive from south Phoenix to come again!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool new place at Desert Ridge. I got a couple different tacos which were pretty good. My fried fish taco wasn't the best, but hey, it's a new restaurant give 'em sometime!

I believe that their was a woman named Alysha on this fine app, talking down on the service. It's a new restaurant. Don't expect five-star service. I just went on a Sunday night for dinner with an hour wait and the service was damn good. 

Again, thank you guys for the support. Let me know where I should go next."}
{"text":"The customer service was just as good as the tequila. Or server Kadee was very helpful, quick and friendly. No waits, the food came out fast and was authentic and delicious. Highly recommend the Skinny Chola margarita. We ordered the California enchiladas and the carnitas skillet. The portion size was large enough to take home. The food was perfectly seasoned and authentic. Great place, we will return."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant to eat at. In my opinion, they have the best carne asada any restaurant can serve. The only better carne asada I have had is my own (which unfortunately is a secret family recipe). Their chips and salsa are also exceptional. One time they made a mistake on my order and the management was very friendly, professional, apologetic, and made sure he made it right. Overall, the service and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd visit to Barrio Queen and but for the amazing food I would probably not go again.  The service was, well, not awesome. What was worse was most of the staff talking to each other. We were seated in the bar and the bartender was completely in the weeds. Hey, that happens and he was a nice enough guy. But why no one stepped up to help or even seemed to notice is beyond me. We just waited forever for everything and people are all huddled up talking about whatever....(sigh). 

Outside of that our food was amazing, just delicious. I had the Queen enchilada with crab and it was to die for. The Birthday girl had Cochinita Pibil which she loooved. I had sangria (yummy) and TBG had a mimosa. 

To sum it up, yes the food is wonderful, but with out good service it means nothing."}
{"text":"So happy it is finally open. Food was good but the service from Jen M was AMAZING!!!. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love you I love you I love you Barrio Queen! I just ate here about an hour ago and couldn't wait to write a review. First of all the location is great, if you don't drive like me the bus will drop you off about 5 minutes away or its just a short bicycle ride from downtown Tempe. Couple of drawbacks but I know this is because they just opened. They didn't have a Tequila list so I had to rely on the waitress to pick something for me. It worked out great because it was delicious. The second is that the portions are a little small but the prices are more than affordable so I can fill up on other things that are on the menu. I started with the vasito. Delicious and tangy! I had two tacos, one was the barrio pollo and the cochinita pibil. Both were very spicy. I like this but others may not. Both were beyond perfection for me. My boyfriend ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla, the \"Mexican truffle\" and the al pastor taco. The 'dilla had just the right amount of wonderful cheese. I ended with the flan. It was very tiny and not enough for two people so you might want to get more than one if you're planning on sharing. I left very satisfied and extremely happy that I finally found a restaurant that can satisfy my craving for delicious, affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"the food was perfect, so unique and the bartender was soo sweet. house margaritas were delish and i'm very picky. the tacos were small but very filling. protein portions were very generous inside of these miniature tortillas. tried shrimp, brisket, and carne asada & mushroom. very impressed by all. also got a sample of the house made white sangria... high octane! very tasty. will be back for sure (:"}
{"text":"So far my visits to Barrio Queen have been pretty darned good. This was my first time to the Scottsdale location. As with my time at Desert Ridge, we were able to grab a nice spot on the patio. While it wasn't overly chilly that evening, having the patio heaters on was nice. Service was quick; two of our party had already gotten their drinks when we arrived, so once we sat down drink orders it took no time at all to get ours.  Our server was pleasant and helpful in explaining on of the drinks.  I will say that while the house margarita is good, after having them several times now they don't necessarily stand out over and above other places and the serving is a bit small in my opinion. I may try other concoctions next time just to get a better feel. I mean, one needs to be thorough in exploring tasty drink items.......

The tacos I ordered were tasty and just hit the spot. The Camaron is becoming a favorite, with delicious grilled shrimp; as is the Barrio Pollo taco. T had the \"Death's Door\" margarita, which had quite a kick to it, spice wise (to briefly get back to the Margarita situation). Tasty and while a little strong, \"heat-wise\" for my liking, one I'd recommend you try. 

Overall the setting of this Barrio Queen is great, located as it is in Downtown Scottsdale. The whole area is great for strolling, shopping and at this time of year soaking up the great Holiday lights and ambiance. An enjoyable time and recommended."}
{"text":"I had the chance to check out Barrio Queen last night when meeting Jim and Twyla for an impromptu meal. After a typically circuitous round of finding a parking spot at Desert Ridge's always annoying configuration, eventually pulling the motorcycle up onto the sidewalk, I joined them at a table out on the crowded patio. Chips and salsa were soon enjoyed  ( the chips have a nice texture and flavor to them ) and a very good margarita soon arrived. 

We all opted for some street tacos, in my case, quoting the menu here: a Barrio Pollo ( Spice-rubbed chicken, caramelized onions and roasted poblano peppers in a spicy piñon cream sauce. Topped with queso fresco ), a Camaron ( Negra Modelo beer-battered shrimp. Topped with cabbage, homemade pico de gallo, queso fresco and Barrio aioli sauce ) and finally the Pescado ( same as the Camaron, but with beer battered fish instead of shrimp ). All were very tasty if a little flimsy-feeling in terms of handling. I'll be back to sample some different items to enjoy, as there are quite a few selections, which I like. 

Our server was very helpful and friendly, as were the other staff who brought out various items when our waiter was busy with other customers. When we were almost done someone stopped by to ask how everything was and thanked us for coming. 

I'll say, for a Tuesday night it was quite busy ( granted, the Thanksgiving holiday is upon us ) but I don't think we ever felt neglected. The atmosphere was good, the many other patrons all seemed to be enjoying the place and it is a good bet we'll be back again soon. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, the special drink is good but pricey but the bad review is the mole con pollo, the mole was ok , but the chicken felt and tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"My husband, son, a girlfriend of mine and myself went here for lunch today no wait time when we walked up at 11:45 we originally wanted to go to lo-lo's chicken and waffles but it was a hour or more wait and didn't want to wait that long so went to barrio's instead and was very satisfied with what we got. All of our food tasted delish, the price was not bad at all for 4 people it came out to 48 bucks. My son is a picky one and will not eat a quesadilla unless it's very minimal cheese and that's what I asked for to begin with and the first one came out with a ton of cheese when the waitress saw my son not eating it she offered to make a new one and felt bad so she went ahead and brought him another one that was perfect so it was nice to get that kind of service. 

Very satisfied and will go back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Barrio Queen once before and were impressed with the food and fun atmosphere, so we were disappointed on this second visit. There were seven of us and it was my brother's birthday. We called days in advance to make a reservation, but they informed us they don't do reservations. We asked if we could call ahead on our way in at least, and they said no. Oh well - not a huge deal. 

We get there at 7, and by the way, on both of our visits here, the hostesses have been snotty and rude. I've worked in my share of restaurants and am aware that hostesses are supposed to be the first and last faces you see as patrons, and should therefore be warm and welcoming. This was not the case. We felt we were bothering them and interrupting their conversation. A smile at least would have helped their situation. Anyway, the wait was an hour to hour and a half. We put our name in and waited in the outside lounge area for an hour and fifteen minutes. We finally get a call that our table is ready, so we go in to follow the hostess to our table, which was actually not yet ready. It still needed to be cleaned. We hovered around waiting (because my 92-year-old grandma did not want to walk back to the front again) and it was cleaned within five minutes or so.

I won't get too detailed here, but basically we had to ask for everything throughout our meal, and didn't receive it half the time. We didn't have place settings and when we asked for some she brought us three (for seven of us) so we had to ask a second time. At this point, we were halfway through our appetizer and needed napkins and silverware. She made us our tableside guac, but didn't bring us a refill of chips for it so we had to ask for that as well. My brother had half a beer and at some point, someone took it away. When he asked the server about it, she explained she had just cut her finger so hadn't been able to check on it, or something along those lines. Needless to say - he paid for a beer he did not get to finish. We wait 20 minutes for our food, which came out in spurts. When the food runner hands me my plate across the table, he warns me it's hot as I've already grabbed it - so that felt nice. Usually at mexican restaurants when the plates are hot, it's because they come out fast, so wasn't expecting that. Let me think, what else happened - my husband ordered a Lagunitas IPA and got the wrong beer (he knows his gross, hoppy IPAs). He could tell as soon as they brought it, but they tried to tell him it was right. He tasted it and confirmed it was not, so they had to bring him the right one. A server who brought the wrong beer also spilled drinks on my grandma. And lastly, and this is the icing on top of the cake (pun intended), we reminder our served who had already brought the check that we had an ice cream cake in the freezer (which came out melty, so I don't think it ever even made it into the freezer). She brings it out with SIX plates. Again, there are seven of us. 

I don't know that I've ever written a yelp review before, but this experience compelled me. Sorry for the lengthy whine-fest, but it was almost laughable that everything went so horribly wrong for my brother's birthday. He really wanted to go here and like I said, we had all been before and enjoyed it, so we were pretty disappointed with how it turned out. I was definitely expecting it to be worth the hour and 15 minute wait. Now that my ranting is done, I can say that honestly, I probably will return one day, but I will also be sharing my experience with anyone who asks. As someone with 10+ years of serving experience, I ALWAYS give restaurant staff the benefit of the doubt, but that experience also means I can recognize when things are not going as they should be."}
{"text":"SO impressed with Barrio Queen! Our server was very kind, quick, honest, and knowledgeable. The location in downtown Gilbert is great- right along restaurant row. Lots of parking nearby (to the side of the building). The food was wonderful- and the best part was the homemade chips and famous guacamole. Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"My fiance was raving about this place at lunch so we decided to try it for dinner. We love mexican food and wish there was more around Scottsdale.
This ended up being a weird experience for us! Let's start from the beginning...
Go up to the hostess and ask to sit outside as its a perfect night.  She apologetically shook her head no and explained there were reservations coming to fill the tables we saw open.  No big deal right, so we sit inside where we were lead to a corner table by the window. 
After about 2mins I noticed the AC was blaring. I figured I could stick it out, not like it is 110 outside yet! 
After looking at the menu which was explained to us the sangria sounded refreshing. Come to find out you have to order a $29 pitcher or a single cup that happens to have jack daniels in it. I don't know too much about sangria, but I know I don't like jack and couldn't get the kind in a pitcher by the glass...
I ordered the Arizona Burrito it came with green chile pork or red with cheese and enchilada sauce on top. I ordered the green chile pork.
After ordering our food the cold becomes a bit much.  I look over and a plant by the door had leaves blowing the AC was so strong. Not wanting to complain we ask our server if the air could be turned down a little.  She reports she has to ask the manager to turn it down.  She comes back and reports the manager said it can't be turned down but told his we can move across the way and it's still her section. My wine finally arrives not long after we moved, less frigged area by the way! 
The food wait time was pretty average.
First glance at my burrito there was green sauce on top, no big deal as I ordered green chile right...as I cut into my burrito the meat was red chile...thinking maybe they mixed up my order as my impression of what I ordered is green chile pork on the inside and red sauce on top of the burrito, I think maybe I read the menu wrong or maybe they meant salsa verde is green chile sauce. IDK! regardless, not wanting to complain and starving I ate it! quite delicious with just the right amount of spice!
Halfway into my burrito I pick up the next bite and hear a HUGE shatter in my head...my fiance asked 'was that a bone?' shocked I shake my head no! spitting everything out of my mouth into a napkin I see a piece of PLATE! i bit a piece of plate and even broke off a piece! checking my teeth I was relieved to not have broken any! We call the server over who apologizes we know its not her fault.  She said she let mgmt know.  She came back took my plate, offered to give us dessert which we refused, said that never happens, and asked us not to not ever come back because of this! needless to say our meal was comp, and the manager never did come over. hopefully he was in the kitchen alerting the staff about the bottom of the plate rims which according to the server protrude and are fragile...
what a dining experience, and after all was done I was still hungry so we went and O got appetizers somewhere else!
More disappointed about how it was handled with Mgmt...who gets plate pieces in their burrito!?"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic as was the service. The Server was very helpful and friendly. I would give Barrio a 5 star rating except for one major complaint. They do not take reservations so our dinner group had to wait over 1.5 hours to be seated. Unacceptable for the class restaurant."}
{"text":"Wish these folks were closer to where I live.  I miss this place already!

A seasonal poblano was available.  Score!  Chock full of chicken and fruit and coddled in an almond. white sauce.  Fabulous.

We also ordered the miraculous quak.  Someone in the kitchen who is quite skilled in the handling of pomeganates (I think that's hard!)  laced the quak with plump, fresh seeds.  Great touch.

No watered down Tex-Mex culture here.  There are fabulous paste-ups on the windows of black & white Madres.  Another mural inside has the Dia del Muertas skulls.  Small skulls encusted with sparkle are at the cash register for purchase.

It's in a strip mall within Old Scottsdale, so parking can be a challenge.  Walk, baby!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try the new barrio queen in our neighborhood. We got there and it was about a 20 minute wait, but they offered to text us when our table was ready.  When we did finally get our table, we sat outside but it wasn't uncomfortable due to the misters. We ordered the guacamole, tacos, chiliquiles, and drinks. Everything was very good and our server was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio Queen 4 times now and have never experienced the inconsistency of service that some other yelpers have. 

Service has always been great! Decor is pretty bold and unique and they have a really cool customer engaging trinket in the lobby. When you walk in there is a mural of hearts to your left. The idea is that if you touch one of the brass hearts on the bottom and someone else touches the other one then you connect hands the hearts above will light up if you have kinetic synergy. It's pretty cool. 

Anyways on to the drinks. Their iced tea is really yummy, their margaritas are fantastic but they don't carry deep eddy vodka - whaaaaa' *said in minion voice*

For the food - I don't like spicy, seriously if anything is even remotely spicy I get the hiccups and can't taste my food - it's just not pretty. That being said I know this place won't be for everyone but I really enjoy the food here. I like the salsa and guacamole (they have salt and pepper on the cart but it's an ask for what you want thing so just ask if you want spices in it.) my favorite is their carne con verde cup. It's very tasty and the meat is super tender. Their chips are homemade and the tacos, albondigas soup and enchiladas I've tried were all pretty good. Their elote could use some love, I can't put my finger on what it's missing but I've had better. All in all I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We got here at 12:30 didn't receive food at until 1:20 took another 30 min for dessert. Was not worth the price and the mole was straight from the can. Food was terrible, server was good, and manager was good. Was a sad disappointment especially because we came here all the time!  This is probably the last time we will go there! Go to lolo's right next door for delicious and fast food!"}
{"text":"Yum! Although the prices are a little bit higher- the food is authentic and the portions quite large. The decor is quite trendy and we've always had kind, knowledgeable staff. The chiles en nogada is AMAZING. Try the guacamole!"}
{"text":"UPDATE--  chorizo is great! Offered on a variety of tacos and entrees...don't miss out!"}
{"text":"WORST food we have ever had....stay away from this $$$ trap....seriously a $16 margarita the size of a small sip cup and we did not finish one thing....ARGH!  Been there, tried it.... NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant. I would eat here daily if I could! Table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it is absolutely amazing. You can get 3 tacos for $10 and they have such a wide variety! I always try a new one and am never disappointed. The margaritas are fresh and you can always get them by the pitcher. Great outdoor patio and dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Super busy and long wait during dinner time on a Thursday. We understand why. We ordered some drinks before hand and these drinks were fantastic and that is saying a lot considering I'm not a tequila fan. The wait of 45 min was worth it. The atmosphere was unique, music was wonderful and food was creative. We had the Coctel De Elote, Chiles En Nogada and Carne Assad Tacos. My wife and I found our new date night place when we have the grandparents babysit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio Queen once before and the last time, I ordered three tacos, all of which were very tasty and that had distinctive flavors

This time, I ordered a variety of tacos and was a bit disappointed.  All of the tacos are street style which means they are smaller than your typical taco.  Not necessarily a problem.  

On this occasion, The first taco I ordered was the Suadero Azteca, which is a taco that has shredded beef.  The taco was very plain and the salsas did not add much to the flavor.  I then had the Al Pastor and the Carnitas, which were fine but did not really stand out to me.

The last taco was the Shrimp Taco.  When Barrio Queen says \"Shrimp Taco\", that literally means all you get is one shrimp.  I have had plenty of shrimp tacos in my life and this was ridiculous.  Who puts just one shrimp on a taco?

I motioned for the waiter to come over and asked him, \"Aren't there supposed to be more shrimp here?\"  He replied that they just put one \"large\" shrimp on the taco.  

On the plus side, the waiter and everyone there was very friendly.   I may actually go back and order something else but my advice to anyone reading is to definitely pass on the shrimp taco."}
{"text":"I liked this place and thought the menu had a great mix of standards along with some interesting specialty menu items. The margaritas are good, but rather expensive. I've been here twice both times left satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that The Barrio Queen has opened up at Desert Ridge! We usually go to the Barrio Cafe but this one is so much closer to home. We were there on October 25th for lunch. We arrived early and got great seats on the patio. The hostesses and servers were all very nice and efficient. The food is the best upscale Mexican food in town! We ordered the ceviche and the guacamole, they were great. We will certainly be returning for dinner. My girlfriends and I are already planning to become regulars. 

They must have a great happy hour, a few days later I was driving by and the whole place was packed!  Since they've only been open for about 2 weeks, give them some time to get their rhythm."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! Great service they offer 3 tacos for a good price! Exceptional taco al carbon( pork) and beef brisket azteca!! A+ they offer a good vegetarian selection as well! Sangria red option A+ good beer selection! We would definitely come back here!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a week to enjoy San Francisco Giants' Spring Training. Friends from back home had recommended this place and the wife is half Mexican so  I figured they knew what they were talking about and they surely did! The first day we came here for lunch, arrived about 11:30 and there was comfortable and prompt seating. We had the Carne Asada salad and it just hit the spot after our flight, arrival and getting settled in.  We then came back deliberately early on a Saturday night and by 5 PM there was a line out front, the hostess was already taking reservations on her iPad at the door, and she said she would phone us when a table was ready. She said 35 minutes and it was 35 minutes on the dot. Both times that we went to Barrio Queen our server was Phillip. He was prompt, professional, friendly and  informative when we asked him the usual touristy questions. For dinner on our second visit, we had one order Chicken Enchilada Mole and one Camarones (prawns)  al Mojo de Ajo (estilo Guaymas) and both were delicious. Even the chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. This obviously popular place manages the crowds very well. The bar on our evening visit was all  but stampeded with diners waiting to be seated but somehow the bartending staff smiled, jammed and everyone got served promptly. It seemed like the patrons were very happy, to include the staff, so that says a lot about what appears to be a very prospering enterprise."}
{"text":"Meh.....don't get the hype. Cool decor, decent drinks, but the food is just ok in my opinion. Guacamole, though fresh did not have a lot of flavor. For the price, there are plenty of other places I would rather go."}
{"text":"If you order tacos, be aware that you will not get tacos.  You'll get TINY little tortillas (maybe 3\" in diameter) with a pinch of meat on them.  NOT WORTH $10.

Order a burrito."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!  -  you are easily fooled by the sweet Hostess at the front door. From there it was pretty much downhill. The food, to say the least was so-so. The prices were astronomical. $10 for a guacamole appetizer?? Do you know how many avocados you can buy for $10? You get ONE. The food was minimally warm. I can see they were having a busy day, but for your server to serve like warm luke food, is unacceptable. There are much better places in Gilbert to go if you want food. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Really cool spot in Scottsdale.  Just dropped in on a random 'Taco Tuesday' food was great and staff was super."}
{"text":"Anything Sylvania puts her mind to she does beyond well! Great customer service from the welcoming staff. Maja you feel like you're part if the family (and not in Scottsdale!)."}
{"text":"Great tacos, huge variety.  Many really unique flavor combinations.  Love the carne asada chorizo y queso, carne asada y huevo, and the pescado!  Several really tasty margaritas.  Try the El Pepino margarita!"}
{"text":"Victor makes a mean prickly pear margarita (secret menu).....order your drinks from him!!!"}
{"text":"Dani was our bartender was on point, very attentive and friendly. We definitely will be back.
We also had dinner. The food is super delicious, the atmosphere was fantastic.  Good times!"}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday on a Sunday evening with friends and family. The decor and table setting is great, The place looks very inviting. it was 6 adults and 2 children. We waited about 10 minutes since we made reservation so that was not bad. They were out of Cocdel de Elote so we settled for their guacamole which was good. Our appetizer arrived before the drinks. Then the waiter brought someone else drinks and we told him no. Me and my friend and parents ordered their Horchata  drink that arrived 15-20 minutes later and it was only one drink, the waitress forgot to put the other orders in. For my dinner, i ordered the soup Caldo Tlalpeno which was little bit on the salty side but still flavorful and temperature was more lukewarm, like it has been sitting out for a while. We all had ordered our main meal and while we are enjoying the appetizers and soup, another server comes bringing someone else's food and AGAIN, this time, we said No! For the main meal, i had their tacos- Barrio Polo Con Chorizo- which was delicious, all spices perfect, to my amazement, specially after all the wait and wrong orders. By the way, our food arrived 20 minutes after the appetizers. Meanwhile, we had to call the server to dim the fire on the patio table, which apparently he was not familiar with. Fire went out and apparently the gas was still flowing, causing a big flame and scaring the children that one of my boy almost fell off the chair trying to get away. The server did not even bother to apologize and got up and said- Let me get some help! Then another person came who was familiar with and started it again, more carefully. We did not order any dessert, we had no interest in waiting for a long time to get something or get someone else's meal.. This was our first visit for me, my family and my friends and apparently a last one at that. The service was less than average, we saw 6 staff members that night who were all running around confused and scattered, wait time for meals and drinks was ridiculous, putting in order for the drinks and forgetting is unsatisfactory. Scaring a child with the flame and handling it when one does not know how to, that is just unacceptable. Food was good and that is why i am giving 2 stars but the service and way things are being run, it is just not worth my time or money!! The staff either needs to be educated on their customer service skills, anyone can make mistakes but should be able to say \"Sorry\" to show a little remorse. If their servers continue to bring meals and drinks to wrong people, that shows inadequate staff education on management's part. I hope they work on it, their location might bring them more customers, but if their customer service does not improve, there are many other restaurants in the same area, that will be worth trying than to waste money on a place where they do not care for the safety and satisfaction of their customers!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by today for Happy Hour on the patio because the weather was so awesome.  We each ordered a margarita, and both noticed that the flavor was not as delicious as our previous experiences at this restaurant.  I asked the server to have mine remade, but the second attempt still had a weird, bitter taste.  In addition, the complimentary basket of chips was laden with grease.  The chips were glimmering with excess oil and a few were chewy.  The server replaced the chips twice and the third basket was finally decent.  Because of the problems with the margaritas and the chips, we decided not to order anything else from the menu.  In the past we have loved everything about the Happy Hour, but today was really disappointing."}
{"text":"From right when you walk in the door till you leave, excellent customer service. And the food was great from a variety of tacos, AZ burrito, table side quacamole, a taste of there own. I highly recommend Barrio Queen and will return often."}
{"text":"We were initially disappointed about the 1.5 hour wait tonight (to be fair it was a beautiful Saturday), but it forced us outside to the open air bar where we could have full service. The bar tenders were friendly and efficient and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful night to sit outside.

The food and drinks  were also delicious. We tried the house margaritas (lime and strong), guacamole (the pomegranate seeds were a perfect touch!), and a variety of tacos. We are only upset that we live out of state and can't come here weekly. Busy, fun atmosphere with yummy food. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch several times and they always provide exceptional service. When the weather is nice, I enjoy the patio. I always end up ordering tacos but wish they had a ground beef one. The table side guacamole is superb as well. Just wish I didn't have to return to work after each visit because I am dying to try the margaritas here!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and it has not disappointed me. First time trying the sonoran hot dog and it it delicious, wrapped in bacon of course. Tacos are always a win my favorite are the fried fish. Drinks are delicious favorite is the sangria Blanca. Atmosphere is great I love that they play a mix of Mexican music!"}
{"text":"Great service. Chris was a great waiter. Food and ambiance was perfect. Great way to end a 3 day weekend. Sangria with a good friend."}
{"text":"Had a heck of a time finding something on the menu not loaded with red onions (which I HATE), but once I did, it was delicious.  Literally the only non-salad thing on the menu without onions, so no point in going back ever again.  Nevertheless, it was really yummy."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  The tacos are delicious, and the coconut margarita is a highlight as well."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Very nice inside and very clean. The restaurant is very cute and has a perfect theme. The music isn't too loud which is nice. The patio is perfect to sit at on a wonderful fall day. Their food is great and fresh. Very authentic. The chips and salsa are exceptional. They have a decent drink menu. They only lose a star because the waitresses are slow. It isn't their fault and service is good but they owner needs to hire more staff. Otherwise, everything is just perfect! Order the burrito because it's huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved taco Tuesday !  Tacos are $2.50 each. Fresh soft taco and ingredients, loaded with flavor.  Would definitely go back when in the area again."}
{"text":"It was restaurant week in Phoenix. For a birthday date night, we chose to try something new off the list of participating restaurants. You get to try out a restaurant at a discount. The place looks cool from the outside, parking close by wasn't a problem. Loads of new places in the area. No reservations available, the wait was only 15 mins. Big place, lots of room. The hostesses were fine though I had a hard time hearing them. Took my phone number and text me when the table was ready. They didn't give us a restaurant week menu, perhaps they didn't want to advertise the sweet deals. So, we asked our server and he happily brought it over. We ordered the guacamole and red sangria. We each got a single serving of guac (the menu was per person). It was different with cranberries but it was good. The sangria was good and a large glass. Next was tacos. I ordered the basic chicken and he ordered the fish. These tacos were maybe 3 inches in diameter. Smallest taco I have ever seen. The chicken was nasty...gamey and flavorless (I also ordered chicken for my main course, I'm nervous now). I sent it back and ordered the chorizo. Soooooooo good. Best chorizo I have ever had. Hands down. He liked the fish taco just fine. Main courses: Carne asada enchiladas and chicken suiza enchiladas. Great portion sizes here. Typical plating style. As expected nasty chicken. The only thing that made the suiza edible was the generous dollop of chorizo on top that I could disburse. But still, I didn't eat half of it. He didn't like the Carne asada either but ate it. The sauce was more Mole than enchilada. Neither of us care for mole. The meat was boring. Our server was very kind, attentive and apologetic about the taco return. Dessert was churros with ice cream. Typical churro, cut in two 6 inch sticks. 1 scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of caramel. The bill arrived.....I have never spent so much money on Mexican food...that I didn't even like...in my life. For the 2 of us, plus tip we spent about 75 to 80 bucks. And we then went thru the menu to see what discount we received off the regular prices....not much only 10 bucks total (5 bucks per person). Why were they afraid of advertizing that \"deal\"..No where near worth it. The shining star was the chorizo but it doesn't shine bright enough to bring me back. My family of 4 can eat for half that at a local favorite with way better food. 10 bucks for guac, 16 for meals, 3.50 for microscopic tacos, sangria priced well at 8 bucks, 9 dollar churros. Who pays 9 bucks for a Churro!!!! Nope nope nope."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is amazing. Was in town and had it twice. Delicious, great service. Substitute for vinaigrette if you want it vegan. Chips are huge, fresh and crunchy."}
{"text":"Love sitting on the patio for dinner. Great for a group.The guacamole is outstanding and made table side. Love the  street tacos ,The veggie and grilled fish taco are my favorite. Service was great,the chef  even came out at  the end of the meal to see  if everything was to our  liking. It was ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Loved this place 23 kinda of tacos I was in taco heaven food good nice service love the decor
Will be back"}
{"text":"Very disappointing service, food, and drinks compared to Scottsdale location. It took forever to get our drinks, even longer to place our order. Food came promptly but those that ordered tacos said meat was dry and flavorless. Famed guacamole lacked flavor as well. For a half full restaurant, I would have expected better service and certainly expected better food. Get it together Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a nice relaxing place to eat this is high on the list. The ambiance of the restaurant is great, staff is well trained in customer service and the food quality is great. There are lots of menus options including plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes too. All the dishes we have had at Barrio Queen have been perfectly cooked, plated and taste amazing. Today we enjoyed a house margarita and Chile Relleno De Vegetales. So much fresh flavor!"}
{"text":"Had to update my review. I always make sure I give a place three goes before I leave a review. The food is great but the service is probably some of the worst I've seen, girls at the front when created are too busy texting to seat and acknowledge us, server had no idea about the menu and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks ( a Coke and a coffee). Restaurant isn't busy either, maybe 15 people in the whole place. Very confused how you can have such amazing food but such terrible terrible service. What a shame."}
{"text":"If you have ever had real Mexican food you will not like this place. No Flavor don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here 2-3 times since moving to Gilbert. The food is okay, but feels overpriced. The restaurant atmosphere and decor are fun, but food is mediocre at best for the prices. We will probably not be back."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed with the service and the food!  I needed accessible seating to accommodate my scooter and the hostess was on top of it.  Our server Brandi was so knowledgeable about the menu!  I appreciated her refilling my water and ice tea numerous times- without me having to ask for refills.  Wonderful service all around!  The food is outstanding.  I enjoyed selecting three different tacos instead of getting three of the same type.  Fresh hand pressed tortillas- need I say more?!  Loved the atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Oh YUM!
I started with a Casa Margarita with an extra shot of Grand Marnier.  It was delicious. Their chips were hefty and filling so eat sparingly waiting for your meal (unless you intend for chips to be your meal ;) 
Get the surf and turf tacos on blue corn you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awful tacos so small disappointed brou g t family visiting from Chicago. ..service was so slow our waiter had no idea what he was doing they use very cheap meat and so skimpy on the chips and salsa please don't waste your money or time with so many other great scottsdale restaurants!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely mexican food for white people. Bright lights, cartoony dia de los meurtos skulls and pomegranate seeds in the guac just scream inauthentic.

HOWEVER, the food was very good. The portions were small so I would judge this as overpriced but overall the meal was enjoyable. The service was decent considering it was a very busy night during spring training."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday afternoon after taking in canal arts festival. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and a quesadilla. The bartender was very personable and made a fun afternoon better. Chips, salsa and the quesadilla were all great. We even got some sightseeing suggestions and look forward to enjoying our trip to Scottsdale and stopping back at Barrio Queen for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place! So glad desert ridge has Bario Queen now! Very delicious food! Margaritas were delicious as well! On a busy evening the wait was not too bad and the service was great! Kind staff...would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was some of the worst I've had in recent memory. Took over 20 minutes to get our order placed. Plenty of staff on duty. When someone did help is they were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came in Friday afternoon to introduce my aunt to some downtown Gilbert restaurants. We sat at the bar and quickly made friends with all the bartenders who were more than eager to make our experience a pleasant one. We ordered the Queen enchilada, chile verde, and carnitas tacos. Everything was delicious! The chile verde tacos were by far all of our favorites. Light and flavorful. We ordered the skinny chola margarita and a dos Equis Amber in a chilled glass to perfection. Overall great atmosphere and the service was amazing! Kudos to Victor, the bartender from the bay, and the other bartender I did not catch her name but she had the perfect eyeliner. You guys are the best! Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday, Christmas Eve, at Barrio Queen in Old Town Scottsdale. This was our 2nd time to eat there. To our surprise, it was very disappointing. For starters, the basket of tortilla chips placed on the table were thick and extra greasy. The accompanying salsa was really good, but the tortilla chips took the joy out of it for us, leaving a layer of shiny grease on our fingers that looked like we had been chomping on fried chicken legs. 

My wife ordered veggie tacos for lunch. The plate came with three tacos, each beautiful but not much larger than a postage stamp. They were more like happy hour tacos, but about three times more expensive. 

I ordered a veggie poblano pepper in a great sauce, but the dish arrived with a flattened, submerged poblano looking like a scrambled mess with no visual appeal. It tasted good but looked confused and unappealing. To make matters worse, this veggie dish was about the same price as the options with beef, pork, shrimp, or chicken. 

So at the end, we wound up with a tab that seemed expensive considering what we were actually served. The service was just okay, not especially attentive or friendly. 

There are numerous restaurants nearby that are commendable where we plan to return often. Sadly, this is not the case with Barrio Queen in Old Town."}
{"text":"Be careful here- I had a meal with family on Sunday -food was good, service I thought was good. I got my bill & it was reasonable. I signed my check & not really thinking anything dishonest would happen left tip area blank & wrote the total in below. My guests were leaving a cash tip. I checked my statement Monday morning after returning home & found $20 added to my bill. Twenty dollars won't kill anyone but the idea of a server or whoever adding to my bill- stealing from me is unbelievably dishonest. I notified the restaurant & they said they'd get back to me. I had to call again this afternoon. Resolved but not satisfied. Beware!"}
{"text":"Oh my, what an experience. The decor is fun, and the atmosphere is lively. The food is to die for!! The guacamole is insane and I am a bit of a tortilla chip expert, and these I could eat forever! I had the Chiles en Nogada, holy moly. I wish I lived here so I could come once a week! The flavors are Devine, and the almond cream sauce is heavenly- especially with the Chipotle mashed potatoes . The pomegranate seeds add such a fun experience. Finally the pomegranate margarita ... yummmm!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican place in town... The nachos chingones are on point!!! The only thing I did not like is the Mexican waters like horchata and Jamaica are 5 dollars and no free refills. There is probably 3 times more ice than liquid! No Bueno everything else is amazing!"}
{"text":"This was yummy!  Great margaritas, great tacos, great churros!  We loved it. If there was one draw back it would be the rather \"unenthusiastic\" server we had once we were seated, but the gal working the patio bar was amazing."}
{"text":"The service was horrible from our waitress but the food was decent.  
We got the pork torta and the brisket enchilada-way too much food for two of us we will share next time. 
We will come back and try happy hour."}
{"text":"We came in quite late last weekend and were treated to very good customer service. The tacos were very tasty and warm. The red sangria was phenomenal. Will be going back again soon. Usually don't like Mexican restaurants, but would put this at the top of scottsdale mex restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio Queen three times. The food has been consistently great, but it is always overshadowed by the terrible service. Everything from waiting more than an hour for a table after an estimated 25 minute wait to drink orders being lost to half of our food order being lost (how does that happen?).  But my favorite was when this Mexican restaurant ran out of sangria, carnitas, and chips ... yes, chips.  Three strikes. It will take a lot to get me back there."}
{"text":"I lived in Mexico City for 9 years and ever since moving back to the US have been on the hunt for good, authentic Mexican food. Barrio Queen met and exceeded my authenticity standards! My family and i went here for brunch a few weeks ago and not only was I excited to find authentic dishes like cochinita pibil, chiles en nogada, mole poblano and caldo tlalpeño but they also had excellent street tacos with some fun and delicious combinations such as carne asada with chorizo and blue cheese (taste buds and mind blown on this one for the record)! The price was a little steeper for the specialty items than I would like to pay but the taco prices are great! Also, their horchata is made in house from scratch, can I get a HALLELUJAH?!?! To say that I highly recommend this spot is a massive understatement. Drop what you are doing and go try some real authentic Mexican food right this second! 

Oh, i almost it was clean and the service was good too...ha!"}
{"text":"I heard all of the hype and had to check it out. The Barrio Pollo taco and the carne asada with egg tacos were out of this world.  We had the carnitas appetizer and it was equally amazing. We arrived around 11:15 and were seated right away. the service was perfect from David W. I have nothing bad to say about this place. We will definitely be back.  Nice work Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here on 11/4 the hostess was unaccommodating and rude. Our waiter kept flying by our table so much so that I had to yell out to him to slow down so my wife and I could ask questions on the menu. The food was so-so but the service standpoint was the most disappointing."}
{"text":"First, I love Cafe Barrio.  The experience has always been top notch.

Unfortunately Barrio Queen completely missed the mark.  I didn't want to like it, I wanted to love it!  Wet arrived about 7 last Friday night.  My partner was very excited because he loves CB.  I liked the interior, it was fun, playful and half-hazzard like CB.  Mike didn't like it, he thought they were trying to hard.  Our friends from Denver liked the interior well enough.

The experience... the waiters, servers, staff all looked busy, looked is the operative word.  The restaurant was less than half full and the staff looked harried and rushed.  When we got to our seats on the patio we all thought what a great night, beautiful weather, fun exciting place and we know the food is good at CB so it should be great here.  We playfully talked to our waiter... which I guess was the wrong thing to do.  Our friends love to laugh and flirt and push boundaries, our waiter was short, abrupt and acted offended.  I reminded him that he was working for tips, then he conveniently remembered he is/was in the service industry.

We had to ask for water repeatedly, and finally our waiter said \"I told the buss boy to get you water...\"   Unfortunately this sums up the waiter experience.  The bus boys were standing at the end of the bar talking... all night... which explains why we waited for thirty minutes to get water.

We ordered the choriqueso and the guacamole for appetizers.  When it came out the choriqueso was a monster bowl of cheese with some spicy sausage which was tasty if a bit overwhelmingly large.  The guacamole was surprising, it came in a very small bowl.  Usually at CB they come to the table and make the guac table side with flourish and panache.  Then I noticed that two tables were there the quac was being made table side... I looked at the tables to see what the difference was and it was glaringly obvious.  Not one of the four of us had boobs.  Then I looked at all of the staff, excluding the two women at the front desk who were wonderful by the way everyone else was male.  The servers went out of their way to make the quac for the tables with ladies but the tables with men we got a quarter order of guac made in the kitchen... reverse discrimination or homophobia... either option sucks.  Unfortunately it didn't stop with the guac...

For dinner Mike ordered the enchiladas de pollo.  I ordered off the \"sushi\" taco sheet the cochnita pibil tacos (great idea, love the concept). Our friends from Denver split the 16 de septiembre chiles rellenos.  Mike was disappointed by his enchiladas, they were not very flavorful and the plate looked like a Chopped Chef threw everything on the plate just to be done in time.  My tacos were as expected, similar to CB good flavor but the same IronChopped Chef ran out of time on my plate.  The chiles rellenos were the highlight, the chef took time to make sure it looked great.  The boys from Denver loved it.

Dessert... the same chef who ran out of time plating Mike's and my plates also ran out of time and I think some ingredients for the churros.  At CB they finish the plate with some ice-cream which (I know it sounds funny) cuts the sweetness of the caramel.  It was sorely missed.  

Unfortunately when we left Mike and I said to each other that the food and the experience was not worth the drive or money (we live by the Biltmore) and if we wanted the food CB was a better bet.  It is a shame really, it is a great space, in a really nice area but it misses the mark by quite a bit.  Our bill was just over 120 for the four of us.  Yes I had two margaritas which were good but 120 plus tip?  Two apps, three entrees and two desserts... 120 plus tip for Mexican food?  CB is worth it BQ... not so much.  

I truly hope they can get the staff trained to be as professional and friendly as CB to all patrons not just those with boobs.  Yes, Phoenix is more diverse than Scottsdale but great service should extend to all patrons regardless of mammary  glands.  I also hope they can get the kitchen staff to take time, slow down and make the food look great (especially when the restaurant is only half full).  The flavors are mostly there, the plating enhances the experience and visually adds to the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! This food is great! The service is good. I love coming here. I like the inside decorations too! They make the guac fresh right in front of you! Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is good...The food can be quite good in fact...but there is something that is not quite right.
I can't put my thumb on it.
Joyride is in walking distance and seems to be 1 star ahead Barrio Queen..and has a better vibe.
The tacos are good...the red salsa was very good....my waitress was fantastic...but something just doesn't add up.
Oh well...Ill try a few more times before I make any final conclusions....and amend my star rating"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was packed.  They took our names and texted us when our table was ready, so we had time to wander around by the canal. We dined on the patio.  The atmosphere was lively, and the service was great.   The three-taco plate was delicious....so many types of tacos to choose from and you can mix and match.  I had some kind of skinny margarita that was very potent and delicious.  We stumbled upon this place totally by accident while checking out old Scottsdale and considered it a happy find."}
{"text":"Really not very good. To start I went with a group of 6 and asked for an inside table. 30 minutes later we were seated at an outdoor table. I guess they misunderstood. It was 20 minutes more before they took our order then 25 minutes to get it. 

We ordered some from the happy hour menu and some from the he regular menu. Both were OK at best with tiny servings. 3 tacos for $10 is a ripoff and rice or beans is $3 more. The $6 happy hour \"specials\" weren't very special.  Maybe they would cost $2 or $3 at other Mexican restaurants. The fish tacos were maybe 3\" diameter, thin soft shell, a tiny bit of fish and cabbage. The shrimp taco had a single medium shrimp. The guy at the table next to us ordered a second round because three tacos were appetizer sized if that. 

I won't be going back. Much better places around by far."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and BQ has the right vibe, great outdoor dining, and solid food and bev.  It's another one of those \"I wish I could give it 4.5 stars\" deal.  I also have to admit that the hardest food critics in the entire freaking world are the people from AZ and NM who are eating at a Mexican restaurant.  Consider this in their rating.  

I've cycled through many of the tacos and the Cochinita Pibil, Camaron, and Al Pastor are all damn good.  If I had to choose my favorite I would say it would be the Cochinita Pibil with those amazing pickled onions.  The tacos are small for sure but the 3 for $10 is not too bad  considering the freshness and quality of the ingredients.  The shrimp is perfect with some of the best texture and flavor I've found.

The drinks are well poured and the house margarita is always spot on.  Their tequilas selection is impressive and vast and I hope to dive into it some day.  Sadly my taste for tequila was tragically altered for what seems to be forever after one ridiculous night in my younger years.  

The 1=point drop on BQ was due to the service being average, not excellent and our table had a bad wobble outside on the patio.  In general they could use an upgrade to the 2 and 4-tops on the patio.  It might be intentional to help \"turn\" more tables but the seats are uncomfortable and I feel like an over sized wookiee on them.   

If you have a larger party however there is a bad ass fireplace table outside that I recall seating about 8 ppl.  If you nail it, you will most definitely feel like \"the man\"..... or woman I suppose.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say. I have never seen a tortilla with no grill marks. The food is very expensive and not very good. In fact our cochjnita pibil was mostly fat. The beans were very sweet and no salsa in sight. Still cost almost $50. For two people. It's cheaper to buy churros at Disney land. Won't be back for sure. Don't waste your money. Lost of better places to eat on this strip."}
{"text":"Near the Scottsdale Fashion Mall...Had the 3 tacos for $10, no rice or beans, 3 small tacos, good amount of meat, but really small  tortilla... Would of given it 5 stars, but slow slow service...wasn't too busy either...will go elsewhere next time.."}
{"text":"We're here to judge mostly on the food itself, so that's why I'm giving 3 stars (otherwise I might do 2). Overall, pretty much everything we ordered was on the level of pretty good to really good. I had the mole game hen - the mole was tasty (although I'm confused why they used such a small bird basically whole on a dish where the sauce is the main component - either break down the bird or use larger pieces of chicken. It's about the sauce!). We ordered a number of appetizers, tacos, entrees, etc, and pretty much everything was good. The one exception was the Tacos al Pastor, which were not good at all. Tacos al pastor is my barometer for mexican joints, and this one totally failed; it was drenched in hot sauce and the marinade for the overcooked pork was just not good. Oh and they used pineapple out of a can.

There were a number of stumbling blocks that unfortunately seem institutionalized and not just a one-night fluke kind of thing. For example, I tried to order the Cochinita Pibil - the very first thing on the menu and an item with a \"try this\" next to it - early on a Saturday night, and they were out. How are you out of one of your main dishes at the beginning of a Saturday night??? 

Now on to the real critique - margaritas and tequila. First of all, our waiter tried to talk us into a really expensive tequila to use in the margaritas. I get it, they want you to buy it, but come on, what's the point in really pushing us? We're not drinking it straight, the tequila doesn't have to be great.

But I could get over that if it weren't for the sheer lack of tequila overall that they use. Our waiter informed us that they use 5 shots of tequila (you only pay for four though!) in a pitcher of margaritas (6-7 glasses). That's right, for $32, you get 7 margaritas that have less than a shot of tequila each! Let's do the math: 5 / 7 = 0.71 shots per glass. 0.71 x 1.5 oz per shot x 40% alc = 0.43 oz pure alc per glass. 0.43 / 8 total oz = 5.4% alcohol! Let me repeat that, for $32 you get a pitcher of margaritas that has BARELY MORE ALCOHOL THAN BUDWEISER (5% ABV). A true margarita should have 12-20% alcohol. What the deal here?

Overall, the food is pretty decent, except the tacos. Just don't waste your time drinking."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the restaurant has major service issues. We had about a 10 minute wait to be seated when there were multiple tables open at 5:00 on a Saturday night. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server who said the server that was supposed to be our server went home sick.  Our server was actually very sweet and did try her best but the issues seem to stem from above. There were at least 2 managers walking around and didn't really seem to know what their job details included. The servers didn't know which tables to serve. I'm not sure what the managers job duties include? Walking around in circles? Other tables were dealing with similar issues. The food and drinks came out promptly. When our bill arrived our server had to make guacamole table side and about 5 other servers and a manager walked right by it, so we waited about 10 minutes just to pay until our server was done making the guacamole. As we were about to leave a family was told their table was ready when it wasn't. They were literally having to stand in the entryway staring at tables. Very awkward. I think if this restaurant could get some consulting in the area of service it would be helpful because the food is decent and the area is hopping."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was absolute garbage. Tasted like leftover chicken. The carnitas tasted terrible. The varna asade was good."}
{"text":"10-25-17 We decided to try Barrio Queen in Desert Ridge again, and what a difference 10 days makes!  We went early, 4:45p, and were seated right away.  Within 2 minutes, we were greeted by our friendly and very cheerful server, Fernando.  Our drinks and appetizer were delivered quickly.  For our entrees, my husband had the Arizona Burrito.  He said it was the best burrito he had ever had.  I chose the Carnitas Michoacanas.  They were very tasty, but a little dry on the top.  We ended with a shot of Anejo Tequila served with some jalepeno and tomato side (forgot the name).  We were also greeted by Amy, who we guessed was the manager.  She was also very friendly and asked how we enjoyed our meal.  We really enjoyed our experience this time and will definitely return."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Everything
on the happy hour menu at Desert Ridge was so blah. No flavor, no creativity, just crap bar food! Not sure whats going on with the scene here either!??? Bar?? Tequileria?? Restaurant?? Not sure but it's too sports bar-ish and was looking for a real restaurant with real Mexican. Too bad.
I will not be back."}
{"text":"My office ordered take out on day 4 of opening... honestly, we were going to wait until week 2 to work out all the kinks new restaurants experience, but... I couldn't wait any longer!  When I arrived there was clearly a wait with a good amount of people waiting outside. I walked up to host stand, greeted promptly, paid, she went and got my food, grabbed me salsa when I asked....I was thoroughly impressed!! Got back to office and although our order was wrong, I won't complain or leave less then 5 stars as the customer service on day 4 was more then perfect!! People create your experience, and this hostess created a positive experience despite not getting what we ordered!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! Oh so good and can't wait to come back! Ceviche is delish! Azteca enchiladas are amazing and the pork tinga stuffed in poblano peppers is amazing, little spicy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for Mexican food!! Delicious and love the decor. They also play the best mix of Mexican music. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Service is fantastic. I come every couple times a month because it is so good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love downtown Gilbert, we live close and are so excited about all of the new restaurants.  Unfortunately we did not have a great experience and will pass on visiting again in the future. :(  We went on a Wed about 6:00pm and sat at the bar, there was quite a bit of staff coming and going from the bar, some to get their drink orders as you would expect and others to just standing around gossiping and complaining. We heard complaints about tips, about staff scheduling, about co-workers, etc. and as much as we would have liked to toon them out they were not discreet and it was nearly impossible to do so.  Now to the food... we ordered ceviche de camaron which was delicious, 3 tacos (the carne asada was pretty good, the pescado asado which came with shrimp in it and not grilled fish was confusing and just so so, and the barrio pollo which was just nasty), and el clasico sonoran dog...just steer completely clear of this one.  We did not complain, we ate, my husband enjoyed his beer, we paid and were on our way...but sorry, we will not be commin back my friends."}
{"text":"Went to Barrio for the first time and loved it! New favorite place in town. The guacamole was the best along with the food and our server Maya was even better!  She was very attentive and knew the menu well and offered a lot of help when ordering. Will be returning, a fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this local fav yesterday for lunch. It was noon on a Friday, perfect AZ spring day. The restaurant was pretty crowded but there was no trouble with seating our party of 8 on the fly. First thing on the table was chips and salsa. Chips were really hard and crunchy, salsa was mild with a slight bite. Yum. The menu has really nice selections. More of a contemporary mexican vibe. We started with the nachos chingones. Good but not over the top. For my meal, I chose the enchilada   suizas- pulled chicken enchiladas, garnished with chorizo and a green jalapeño tomatillo sauce. It was delicious with a really nice bite. MAY be too spicy for some but I like heat in my food. There were 8 in our party, 3 ordered the same dish, one ordered carne asada enchiladas, 3 went with a mix and match of tacos and one had a beautiful and interesting dish named chiles en nogada- a pepper stuffed with chicken, apples, raisins, pomegranate seeds and more. Overall, I really liked this place. It's  been on my local restaurant bucket list for a while now. I would go back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The lead question my wife and I asked each other was, \"How do you screw up guacamole?\" This Barrio Queen location managed to do it. Tasteless and spice-free made with unripe avocados that tasted like nothing. 

Sadly, the rest of the meal mostly held true. My wife had the elotés to start and said it was quite good. But her entree was lacking. The squash was good, but the beans, rice, and molé were also completely free of taste. 

I had street carné asada tacos which were okay (@$4 per, \"okay\" doesn't cut it), accompanied by rice, which was as uninspired as the guacamole.

Since they just opened I might try them again in 6 months too see if they get their poop in a group. On the other hand, they've got other locations, so they really ought to have their menu squared away. 

The atmosphere was not terribly pleasant. It was soulless and corporate. They seem to want me to think that I was in a cool, one of a kind place, and it's decidedly not. Disneyland is less corporate. Applebee's is less corporate. Hell, McDonald's is less corporate. No wonder chef Silvana spilt from these guys. 

The bright spot was the cocktail my wife had. She said it was delicious.

Still, not a good value at half the price."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was great. our second was terrible -- I think mostly because of the waitress or waiter. 

This time, my partner and I went with a friend. We ordered an appetizer (french fries topped with corn, cheese, etc) that never came. Which is OK, because we were busy munching on chips -- which they didn't refill. We ordered vegetarian tortas again, but this time my partner requested hers without pablanos. I did want pablanos on mine and made sure to specify to the waiter that, while my partner did not want them, I did. After a very long wait, we got our food, neither torta had pablanos on them. Both were soggy and cold. 

After we finished eating, our waiter came to ask if we were ready for the bill -- which we requested be split. When the bill came, the appetizer we did not receive was on the bill -- which is especially frustrating because the waiter had to *think* about which party ordered the appetizer he did not deliver. The waiter ran off and we had to wait again. When he came back we mentioned that we never received the appetizer... \"Oh, OK\" he said as he ran off. When he came back again he said \"Oh, we can just box up the appetizer because it is ready and you can just take it home\". 

I'm fairly certain he was trying to get us to pay for the soggy cheese and corn covered french frys that had been sitting under the heat laps for the last hour because he forgot to bring them to the table. No thank you -- good riddance!"}
{"text":"Evette our server was awesome!

quick service. all the employees were really nice.

sat at bar table. Had the guacamole and chips. Really tasty and a little bit of spice. did a variety of tacos. Their taco menu resembles a sushi menu in that there are probably like 20 or so and you check off how many you want. Pulled pork, the cameron or shrimp tacos in beer battered victoria were awesome. Even have a pork taco that has cactus grilled in it. Salsas were great. 

tacos are nice size but not too big. Get a bunch of them and enjoy. They have all the mexican beers in bottles and draft plus looked like a ton of tequilas.


Quick Tip!!!!

If you go in during the busy winter season, if they say they are completely booked ask if you can grab a table that needs to be cleared before the next reservation. Quite a number of people arrived at 5:40pm for example and were told if you can be done by 7pm then you can have a table right now as opposed to waiting 2 hours. 

Not sure why some people claim the service here is bad or give it poor reviews because servers suggest drinks or apps. Thats what they are supposed to do!."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco De Mayo for the first time. It wasn't too busy when we got there but still an hour wait despite many open tables. We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited outside on the patio for our table. The El Don margarita was legit. Appreciate that it is hand made fresh with no margarita mix. I had the Barrio Pollo tacos and they were great. My friend also had tacos which were good. The chips and salsa are to die for!!! Will def. be back."}
{"text":"Sat outside and enjoyed a nice lunch here.
It was very busy and service was still good.

The tacos and other items were very good but a bit pricey.
This probably is due to the location in the main Waterfront area.

The girls enjoyed several margaritas and they have an EXTENSIVE tequila menu.

The outdoor patio is dog-friendly and several people were there with dogs following a walk around the waterfront and shops. Overall, it was a nice, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a place that seems pulled down by the service.  The food is good and fairly priced, but the service does need some improvement.  I asked for some extra tortilla's and finally 15 minutes later (and the food was cold by then), they show up.  In general, perhaps it was a bad night, the service was slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe has been on my list of restaurants to try for a long time.  We were getting together with a friend who lives in Gilbert and decided to give the Barrio Queen a try.  On a Wednesday night about 6:30 PM, we had a wait of 15-20 minutes, even though there were several open tables - it seems they probably had a staffing issue.  And then we were seated right in front of the door to the kitchen, but we didn't complain.  The server was very nice, although she seemed to be overwhelmed with too many tables.  It also took awhile for my friend's margarita to arrive.  As for food, I think we were all underwhelmed.  We started with the elote appetizer - it was not much more than wet corn, with a little cheese on top and not seasoned very well.  I've had elote in Sedona at the Elote restaurant, and this version is not even in the same league.  My husband and I chose the 3 taco deal and they were OK, but sparse on the protein (my shrimp taco had only one shrimp).  My friend had the carne asada burrito.  After the first few bites, she found a hair on the tortilla - yuck.  The server was nice enough to take the charge off of the bill, but the experience was ruined at that.  I will say that the staff was pleasant and the salsa was pretty good.  Otherwise, I was totally disappointed in the experience - there are many other Mexican restaurants out there that have a lot better food for the value."}
{"text":"Her signature dishes aren't impressive. I would opt for REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food over this place.

Staff was rude, racist, and the food was mediocre at best.

Don't go.

Not to mention word on the street is the Barrio Cafe is one of the dirtiest kitchens in Phoenix."}
{"text":"When we first sat down our server never came by and we finally flagged down a gentleman.  He apologized and took our order. He then sent over complimentary table side fresh guacamole.   It was A-amazing!!! It's a must order! Pomegranate seeds on top makes the dish out of the norm and delish!"}
{"text":"Great service from Rebecca. Food was great. Fun atmosphere. Location is good with lots of parking. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen, barrio queen, where for are thou barrio queen. 

I have been to Barrio Queen several times and have always had a good time and great food. 

The ambiance is great. They have a bar and great seating. The service is very pleasant as well. 

The carne asada is great. Especially the tacos. Last time I was there I had the menudo which was wowza awesome. Tasted home made.  

You always get chips and salsa right away. And this is where my only complaint lies. The chips are not like you would get anywhere else but there is something about them I don't like. They are perhaps too large and break apart easy. 

Overall the food is great. Great atmosphere and good service. Can't go wrong. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! We caught happy hour margaritas at the bar and then moved to a table for dinner. Very flavorful entrees and love the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Yum! After three visits I am a huge fan! The chili relleno torta is my favorite and the guacamole is really great as well. The burritos are huge and very good as well. I have had great service each time I have gone and love the patio and unique atmosphere. Some of the different margarita flavors sound odd and end up being really good so try them! There are some unique selections on the menu and I can't wait to try more of them but I can't seem to get past the chili relleno torta! The fries that come with it have chili powder seasoning on them which is different but I really liked it. Huge tequilla selection if you are interested in trying different ones. Our server was knowledgable about them which was nice. I will be back to try some tacos and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food was good had chorizo and eggs drinks are well made the bar keep is friendly and a bit twisted but a cool fun place."}
{"text":"We were big fans of Silvana's original restaurant, Barrio Cafe.  And then we moved further away and didn't get there quite so often. We were very happy when Barrio Queen opened. We like it.  Each time we've gone, we've been promptly greeted and seated. The staff has been very professional and courteous.  The food tastes really good. Lots of flavor and interesting ingredients.  And the margaritas are out of this world."}
{"text":"We were super impressed with the service here and the food.  The manager and the staff were really nice and helpful; they took time to make sure we were comfortable and happy and satiated.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was great, drinks were great, and food was even better! Love the chips and salsa!! We had our kids with us and sat outside. Misters we're on which helped with the heat. We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Yvette and Tyler are AWESOME!  Food is wonderful! Customer service superb.  Their green sauce ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Today's visit was the second time i have been here. WOW! 

Appetizer: Guacamole ****MY FAVORITE GUACAMOLE EVER!****
Taco's: Barrio Pollo & Chorizo taco was amazing, Arrachera con Relleno was great and the Carnitas taco was good. 

Service was great, food was extremely tasty and i will definitely be going back. 

(Side note: They have outdoor seating and are dog friendly.)"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open.
 The outside is so cool and inviting... And of course I love Mexican food.
The interior is really fun and modern and the staff was awesome! Great customer service all the way around.
The tacos were so yummy, chips and especially the salsa was delish, and the enchilada was very deep in taste.
Can't wait to go back and have more!
I thought the chicken tacos and the grilled shrimp were the best!"}
{"text":"We ate at the Desert Ridge location. We split the Queen enchiladas with shrimp and the brisket enchiladas. In place of one of the black beans sides, we ordered chipotle mashed potatoes. Everything was awesome but the potatoes weren't warm. The brisket was slightly sweet but also spicy. Good combo. The Queen enchiladas were good with jumbo shrimp served on the side. 

We came on a Sunday night and they were pretty busy. Be prepared to wait. They don't accept reservations."}
{"text":"yesterday was the second time eating there and omg it was fabulous again!! Tuesday is taco day and the food is so flavorful nothing i have had compares to this place. Fresh ingredients from the margarita tasting like it has fresh limes with no artificial flavors or additives-to the hand made tortillas, chips, salsa, churros, pulled pork, carne asada the list goes on and on-- get in here and try it for yourself you will not be dissapointed finally a great fresh flavorful place in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Awesome Guacamole! Cool atmosphere and great service. Reasonably priced and hearty portions!"}
{"text":"Slow service and food was tasteless. Screwed up our order, family visiting from East coast totally disappointed ... Shrimp taco with one shrimp ...  Burrito was all Rice ...."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food and Daniel K gave us good recommendations and great service. My wife and I enjoyed the fish tacos and carnitas michoacarnas. It was excellent."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Customer service is the greatest! Cocktel De Elote is a MUST! Literally the best thing I've eaten in a while. They're very pet friendly too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with my parents who are visiting from out of town. Outside seating is great, misters take care of the heat in the summertime. Daniel our server catered to us with speed and care. 

Thank you !"}
{"text":"Tried out the new location today. The food is great but the service is pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Barrio Queen. This time for lunch. As in the first visit - I wasn't really impressed. (supposedly one of the top 25 Mexican restaurants in the country?) The tortilla chips seem to be hand made from their own, but for just dipping salsa the chips are too hard and thick. Also the salsa is colorful and looks great - it is actually quite bland in flavor.  Now on to the tacos. I ordered three. 
1. cochinita pibil (house signature taco). The pork marinated in citrus was a good attempt - but there seemed to be a heavy cardamon or cinnamon spice lurking in the background of the marinade that dominated the flavors. I like the taste of slow roasted pork but the marinade killed it. 2. carne asada chorizo y queso.  Grilled steak was tasty but the Chorizo was burned. Last time I ate here same thing with the Chorizo? I am a chorizo fan and burning chorizo adds a bitter finish - like eating charcoal. 3. Camaron - I wouldn't know if the shrimp was any good since I was brought a fish taco (pesado) instead. I tasted Tilapia - not the fish I expect to be served in an upscale Mexican restaurant. 

When I brought up the fact that I was served the wrong tacos to our server, her response was pretty much nil. The same as her tip.

Won't go back - I can pretty much guarantee third time would not be the charm. Also, I have had better, more authentic Mexican food all over the valley - I do not understand how Barrio Queen receives national recognition."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I'm a very picky eater and I was NOT disappointed! I had the Barrio Burrito and no exaggerating, probably the best I've ever had. The flavors and white cream sauce was perfect. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and this is our first time at Barrio Queen... and I have to say there's a lot to be desired.

Food - The food was just ok... we ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer and while it was melted cheese it seems to me it should be a bit more soupy/saucy with regards to the texture. I ordered a taco trio which was serviceable but I've had the same level of food for cheaper in the area.

Service - The service was a bit slow... and we showed up before the dinner rush at about 445pm. Other places have runners doing the chips and salsa and it seemed that this place could use that same model so that the servers are more timely and attentive. We waited longer that you would expect to place our order.

Ambiance - The ambiance was ok... and it looks like sitting at the bar could be fun... however we arrived with our 3 year old who's pretty well behaved and was seated well in the back by the kitchen pretty far away from other patrons and what I would call prime seating.

Ultimately, I expected more from this place.. and given the amount of competition in downtown Gilbert, I feel like they would need to step up to maintain their clientele. I would try this place again based on the fact that there looked like there was some interesting chile relleno options that I know my father in law might enjoy... other than that, there are plenty of other Mexican food places that are worth my while."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar, the weather was great! Anthony is the most attentive, responsive, and joyous bartender ever. I stayed longer than intended, but have become a loyal regular. Who needs a therapist when Anthony is on duty?"}
{"text":"Huge, flavorful burrito, great drink selection, friendly service, and charming patio seating."}
{"text":"When my office asked where I wanted to go for my birthday lunch I didn't hesitate at all before saying Barrio Queen.

As someone who's loved the original Barrio Cafe for the decade or so its been open, Barrio Queen is a worthy addition to the lineup. For those who are used to the original, Barrio Queen is just as tasty, but has a little more room and better parking.

Whether you go for the three tacos for $10, the Cochinitas Pibil torta sandwich, an enchilada, quesadilla or anything else on the menu, you will likely be happy.

Because it was my birthday, we also decided to try the desserts. I thought the chocolate cake was delicious and my coworkers liked the churros.

I haven't been there at night, but I hear the margaritas and other drinks are tasty as well.

My only complaint is that they seemed a little understaffed at lunch. One waitress seemed to be handling the whole place and as nice as she was, she was a little overwhelmed so at times we had to try and flag her down for service.

All in all though, Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great location, very busy!  The food and drinks were absolutely exceptional. They really lacked I service which was a big disappointment!  I will go back again and give it one more try. It's a shame because the food was so good!

Barrio Queen reached out and we will be going back, update to follow but I changed my review stars because I know the service next time will be great and I know the food can't be better. 

I appreciate managements quick response too."}
{"text":"I did a to-go order of pastor tacos, asked for the sauce on the red sauce on the side. When I got there I told the hostess that I'm here to pick up and order, she chuckled after because of the name we put in \"Coco\" it was kind of offensive the way she said \"for coco?\" And how she laughed as well.. when I got home I see that they put the red sauce on top of my tacos! Not on the side like I asked, it was also $10 for 3 mini tacos... the price is not worth the product OR service. I highly recommend eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Me and my husband really enjoyed this place. We ate lunch/early dinner here. Our margaritas were great and we loved choosing different tacos to eat rather than just getting one plate with the same taco. I don't remember the exact names of the tacos but they were all great (pork, fish, shrimp. steak etc). Wish we had a Barrio Queen in Jersey."}
{"text":"So this won't be hard to review. First time here. Sat at the bar. Cold food. Slow service. Bar staff was overwhelmed by the clientele. It wasn't crazy busy either. The lady bartender was not on target with her friendliness level. In fact, she was the rudest of them all. Her greeting to us was not hi how are you...it was are you sitting here to wait for a table to open...uh...The guys were better, there's potential there. We had to wave them down after 20 minutes to get another beer. They never checked on us to see how the food was. Which of the three tacos I tried I was only impressed with one (it doesn't help they were cold). I doubt we come back. Next time we may just go to SoCal Tacos. Edit: we told one of the bartenders how bad our experience was, he said he'd get the manager. The manager didn't come after 15 minutes of waiting. Thanks."}
{"text":"I had the Enchiladas Suizas and a Michelada. My husband had the carne asada plate. My enchiladas where very Yummy! They should probably cut up the carne asada instead of serving a huge slab of it like a steak. Both plates were covered in chorizo which I love (so I can't be mad at them for that) but it kind of takes over all the other flavors. IMO if you want to add some chorizo flavor to your tacos that's what you order the queso fundido for. Over all it was probably the closest to authentic Mexican food I've had in AZ. That is the main reason I'd visit again. It was all over prized for sure. They were very busy but the service was good. I'll do taco Tuesday instead of dinner next time and maybe try a dessert."}
{"text":"I love tacos and I love trying out different restaurants that serve them.  My husband and I went to Barrio Queen yesterday afternoon for lunch.  We both left very disappointed and hungry.   First we tried the El Rey Vasito de Elote which we were anxious to try since we've had this dish before in another restaurant.  This dish came out in a smallish cup and it was served with nothing, no chips.  I guess we were supposed to eat this with a spoon like some kind of corn pudding.  This dish has always been served with chips at other places, why not at the Barrio Queen?  Must say, it really wasn't that good and we didn't finish it.  We both ordered tacos and they were just ok.  Such a rip off these small 3 bite street tacos.  These tacos were served with 2 salsas...if you can call these 2 small containers of the most watered down \"salsa\" I've ever seen, and absolutely no taste, no chunks of tomatoes, peppers, nothing.  I find it funny the runner who brought out the salsa warned the red was spicy. 
This place will be a hit with tourists since it's in a prime location.  The tourists can have this place, we will never be back."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, and Barrio Queen did not disappoint.  Amazing flavor in my shrimp enchiladas, and the margaritas were out of this world.  The service was AMAZING as well.  The staff had a great sense of urgency and teamwork, and the manager stopped by to chat towards the end of our dinner - super nice guy and extremely concerned about our experience.  To the people whining about portion sizes, this is gourmet dining.  Plenty of restaurants within a mile that serve huge portions of traditional Mexican food.  And as for the people saying go down the street to Joyride - I'm pretty much speechless.   If that's what you're looking for, SoCal Fish Taco company blows Joyride out of the water, but neither of those places hold a candle to the fare at Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"I don't like paying for chips and salsa!!  Just give us the darn things and charge for refills.  The chips were indeed good, but I don't know about the $4 price tag, maybe even lower the price.  Happy hour has great deals, if you are into high-end tequilas!  All tequilas and appetizers are 50% off.  I have only had the app Carnitas en Chile Verde because it is so delicious (bowl of yummy melt in your mouth pork with cheese etc. with homemade chips to scoop it up)!  The patio and atmosphere are decent.  My service always seems to be alright here, not horrible, yet not great either.  Not sure I would go out of my way to come here aside from the happy hours :)"}
{"text":"Food is not really worth the hassle here folks. Barrio Queen is very proud of their food (very expensive for what you get) and I've never had anything but loooooooong wait times on a table AND on the waitstaff once you are seated. Being local I know to expect Scottsdale prices, but the food and service do not justify it here. My first visit my husband and I sat at the bar and were ignored for a good 10 minutes.
On my last visit I took an out of town business colleague here raving about the food. We had terrible wait times on our server and was flat out ignored by her, which was par for the course considering my first visit. Two chances, same poor service, will not be returning."}
{"text":"It was exactly what I expected: over-hyped, but decent Mexican food. A solid 4. 

Flavors were nothing spectacular, but actually a bit better than I expected. The highlight was the chile en nogado - that was really good! Also got the barrio fries with 50-50 chile verde and street corn which I would probably do again; 2 tacos (chochinita pibil and chicken+chorizo ... the latter was more unique, but both were respectable); and a side of chile verde (way too mild for my liking - almost bland). The tres leches cake was the second highlight - a large portion, very good flavors (although a little dry)."}
{"text":"Long wait for mediocre food...the chips and salsa was excellent but everything else we ordered wasn't great. My husband ordered the pozole and it didn't have much pork and the hominy was almost nonexistent. My plate was room temp and seemed like it had been sitting for a while. I wouldn't recommend waiting over an hour for food that isn't very good."}
{"text":"Stunning decor and the tacos were delicious (I just wish they were a little bigger).  The best was the guacamole, they make it fresh, as you watch!  The sweet tart cranberries are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This newest Barrio Queen is a masterpiece.  The decor, patio and artwork is beautiful!  They have great beers on tap and the table side gauc is to die for.  I love their food, everything they make is delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was bad! The carne Asade was tough and chewy - our second visit pretty much the same issues sadly we  won't be back. Vanessa our server was less than pleasant  forgot parts of our order and just seemed too preoccupied to wait on us. We were seated and waited for a drink order to be taken and then waited for our drinks so long that another server came by and asked if we had been helped. Cute place but service and food way below par.
One last thing- the sewer gas smell at the entrance of the restaurant is terrible."}
{"text":"The entrees were pretty good, but the chicken taco side was 3 inches in diameter with a small spoonful of filling. The margarita seemed to be lime water with no discernible alcohol. The beer order was the wrong size and type.  The Barrio Queen seems popular, but fairly mediocre in our experience."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch on taco tuesday. Sat on the patio, waited 10 minutes before we had to ask for drinks. Bartender told us he would find us a server. Got our drinks, waited til were done with them. Still no server. After 30 minutes decided to pay and leave, since the other servers were standing around talking about where to get drinks later. The bar tender told me i could keep my cup in the beginning. But while leaving stopped by two women telling me i wasn't allowed to have the cup. Whatever. Told them what happened. They told me they didn't care. So 1 star, couldn't do 0. Wont be back. Will not tell anyone to go here. Service sucked. Worst i ever had."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from Santa Clara on holiday at a nearby Hilton when were in the mood for Mexican food.
After walking in downtown Scottsdale we decided to try this place. We were immediately seated by our waitress, Ivette(sp), and were given a complimentary appetizer. The booth my wife, six children, and I sat in was perfect. I ordered the Barrio Pollo Burrito...OUTSTANDING! The quality of the chicken was superior. The horchata is the best I have ever had and the genuine service Ivette provided was top notch. 
I look forward to returning to Barrio Queen when in the Scottsdale area in the future."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was our first time.  The steak burrito was so awesome and very filling.  Loved the tortilla soup.  Awesome twist on fresh guacamole with pomegrante seeds.  Not in this area often but will be back when we get there!  Great service and atmosphere in Old Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Order the guacamole, it is the best on the planet! The shrimp tacos were stellar and service was very good.  It is very good value and if you're a tourist (I live here part time) you'll love the ambience of old town."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Seated quickly. Loves the relaxed atmosphere that was evident throughout the restaurant. 
Ordered 3 tacos and 2 Victorias. Each of the tacos were the size of the street tacos I get in LA, not small like others believe. The meat and condiments were tasty,hot and FRESH! Service was on point. 

My only negative was that they didn't have XL shirts. I figure it's just another reason to return for more tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great happy hour specials, phenomenal tequila selection and the best tacos in downtown Gilbert. Luke and Nicole are awesome bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and hip sugar skull artsy  vibe. Our servers have been wonderful and when there is a wait, it doesn't last too long. I do wish they had call ahead seating but the food and ambience is great!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Happy Hour wine also good. Food was terrible. We ordered our dinner and within 3 minutes we had our cold meals. Very greasy. Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place was good! I had the chicken burrito (Bario Pollo) and it was definitely something I never tasted before. Very good. I like restaurants that differentiate themselves from the rest. Everybody at our table like their dish. Carne Asada burrito and enchilada's all tasted good. We sat outside, it was nice and quiet. Great atmosphere. Flowers smelled good on the patio and everything. 

Only thing was that the waiter forgot to bring water that we asked for and my wife was choking from the chips and salsa and I asked him if he could bring out a water for her. And he said \"Oh thats right! Well let me just take your orders first while I'm here\" 

...Moment of survival...

Maybe he thought I would just let her have a sip of my beer, I don't know but shes 4 months pregnant so it came down to let her choke or give the fetus alcohol. And I chose choke because I had a feeling her chance of survival was higher if we waited for water."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, handcrafted margrithas not the usual lots of juice & ice, the rest doesn't matter drink. Quick and friendly service. I had a carne asada salad, great meat which is the main ingredient in this salad rest of salad ok but not outstanding."}
{"text":"This was my first time, I came with my wife for a night out. We drove by this restaurant. It looked live from the outside so we decided to give it a try. . Glad we did I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some great south of the border food."}
{"text":"Got seated immediately for a table of two. The servers we had were very nice and friendly. The fries we got as an appetizer were huge!!! My tacos were delicious. Boyfriend's burrito was gigantic and he loved the tender pork! I loved the variety of tacos on the menu and the boyfriend was very impressed with their choices of Tequila. His drink was really strong. Some bang for your buck!! My horchata was absolute perfection. Will definitely be coming again with more people!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a family lunch with the 4 of us on a Saturday. The price point alone is enough to discourage my return. We each ordered an entree, shared the guac, and had a total of 4 drinks (2 margs, mimosa, beer) and the tab for LUNCH was $115. There is sooo much competition for Mexican food in the valley, I know I could have had food better than BQ for less than half the price. 
 
The Marg was good but small and overpriced. I ordered the veggie relleno for $14. It was just ok. If I had wanted to add meat it would have been another $6.
 
We waited about 45 minutes for the food, to the point where I had to ask about it. This was after we ate the guac. My MIL loved the pomegranate seeds, but I am more of a guac traditionalist and that is just not for me.
 
Less than ok but not horrible. If they took in a price reduction I might consider returning cuz nothing was horrible, just wasn't worth the money or wait."}
{"text":"I know it's because of the area, but no reservations is a BIG bummer. Plus, the fact that when we went they didn't seat us for about 15 minutes, then proceeded to seat us at a table that had been empty the whole time we were waiting. We know there was a shift change coming up, but we would have been happy to nurse some drinks at a table. 

We've been to the Scottsdale location so we knew what we were getting into food wise, and it was just as good as expected. My house margarita knocked me on my rear-end, but it sure was tasty. Carne asada burritos with TONS of cheese are definitely the way to my heart, and many taco selections are the way to his, so we were both satisfied after eating here."}
{"text":"We dined here not knowing it was Taco Tuesday and boy, we were glad we did!! We ordered the guacamole, 6 different tacos, the carne asada burrito, a carne asada kids meal, as well as a pitcher of the white sangria. Everything was delicious!!! As for the restaurant itself and the service, we dined outside since the cool misters truly made dining outside a pleasure. Service was great too, especially since they treated our 21 month old son so well!!!"}
{"text":"I was happy to try this new spot in the gallery neighborhood.  We were there early, so got a table right away and had time to look over the large menu.  Got to try some fantastic tacos, which are nice and small, so we could have a few each.  I am looking forward to going back and trying more."}
{"text":"Drinks: 
Jalapeño Margarita- sometimes it is spicier than other days but today it had quite the kick (so beware)... I like spicy though so I would definitely recommend it

House margarita- they use Maestro Dobel, which is a pretty good tequila, especially for a house margarita, so I would also recommend this one

Food:
I had the Carne Asada taco (not recommend) - it was pretty dry and one time I bit down and it felt like I was biting on sand so I almost gave up but decided to have another bite... felt like sand again... so yeah, not a fan. 

I also had a Camero Asada taco- they were tiny shrimp and only two in the taco but regardless, it was a tasty taco. 

Service:
We sat at the bar so we had great service but I can't speak for dining room service. 

Not the worst, but not the best. I might be back for drinks but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"The facts, Saturday night 7:30 about a 45 minute wait for 3 people. Place is slammed no seats in the bar to grab a drink. Total chaos for the staff trying to deal with the rush. Tequila bar was a separate room aside from the main bar and dining area sat about 7 people looked like it had exploded very messy and had no organization, bar tender needed a bar back. She was dry and unfriendly kinda like we walked into a crime scene. The staff was stressed and struggling all night. We ordered guacamole which was done table side but the server lacked skill and confidence and made excuses for the unripe avocados which are the base for the whole dish. At $15 bucks it wasn't very good.  We placed our dinner order and waited an hour before we saw the plates. Another excuse for the long wait was \"we are waiting on the carnitas\".  20 years in the food industry in a former life, carnitas pork shoulder are slow cooked the night before or day of so its ready to go on the plate right? The other plates were street tacos. Food tasted great however we all ate too many chips and salsa during our wait. 
I have been to the other location prior and it was good. My thoughts are managers get your bugs worked out fast before you lose anymore repeat customers. We started out at 7:30 and left at 1030. Place has potential to be great. Nicely decorated and a good layout with a nice patio!"}
{"text":"I had great expectations for Barrio Queen but the second I walked in with my date the hostess (short blonde hair and thin) never gave a hint of a smile, what a turn off.  Felt like I was a burden more than a welcome guest.  Place was not busy as we were there around 9PM but sat at our table wondering when the chips and water would arrive.  After 5 minutes we left with no intention of really going back as there are too many other choices on that strip to choose from.
I only hope the owner is reading this.  As a business owner first impressions are with the host or hostess then the service.  What a shame as this is not the only business to behave lack luster, such as Peterson's Ice Cream which get's my next review."}
{"text":"Visited the Scottsdale location last night during Restaurant Week. Tableside guacamole was very tasty (although it could have been spicier), the carne asada was good too, though they were out of the pork dish I was hoping for. I would have given 4 stars but had my heart set on that dish.  Loved the décor and ambiance; the staff was attentive. The churro was heavenly :)"}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side for what you get but the food was ok.  Also a lot of the staff seemed to be socializing with each other instead of focusing on their jobs.  They are in a great location though."}
{"text":"The new location of Barrio Queen is just as good as the original.  Diverse menu of tacos, so you can definitely find something new.  Trendy location in downtown Gilbert is bringing the crowds, so be prepared to wait, or find a seat in the bar area."}
{"text":"How can any so called mexican rest stop serving  salsa.  What gives is it to costly.  Please let all you customers know about your recent elimination of salsa and chips!Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not worth the price. Had the \"egg carne asada\" tacos that were recommended by the server. Blah--- at least I could wash it down with a Dos Equis beer. Wouldn't go back here... for food anyway. Much better options in DTG"}
{"text":"Recommended by a local. Guacamole is made fresh at your table - pretty good for a restaurant. Tacos were also enjoyable with excellent service. Pretty casual place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"We visited Barrio Queen in Scottsdale on 6/8/17. The restaurant was very busy. We had to wait to get a table inside for about 15 minutes. We were quoted 20 minutes. We got seated at a very small table in a very noisy area. We didn't have enough room on the table for our drinks and chips & salsa so gave back our waters. We were served water by the hostess after about 10 minutes. We were extremely disappointed with our noisy small table and almost walked out. Our server finally took our drink order 15 minutes after we were seated, chips & salsa arrived shortly after. We got drinks in 5 minutes. Server still hadn't taken our order so I proceeded to ask the hostess if we could move to a booth in the bar area. She was very accommodating. When we got seated in the bar we told bar server we wanted to order right away because we had been waiting so long. He took order immediately and food arrived in 10 minutes. We both requested our sauce on the side and when entrees arrived they were exactly as ordered. We had different servers throughout the meal however all were helpful and accommodating. Food was delicious, quantity and presentation were good. 
Food and bar drinks were a little pricey however this was Scottsdale. If we returned we would definitely ask to not be seated in the noisy section by the door."}
{"text":"Luke and Victor are the absolute best bartenders. We come in here every Friday solely to see these two. Great food and great service every time."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican Restaurant in Gilbert. We loved it."}
{"text":"This is not a review about the food because there was no room at the inn.  I walked into barrio queen at a little after 6:00 pm on a saturday--I would say there were people at a third to half of the tables--the hostess says they are completely booked for the evening and could not take walk-ins until at least 9--walked down Stetson--and there were tables at several other restaurants in the neighborhood--if they had tables I find it difficult that barrio queen was completely booked even though they were half empty.  not sure I will try again."}
{"text":"I'd make an argument that this place should not consider themselves a Mexican restaurant but that's probably just my opinion. To me this place is American \"southwest\" food. It's over priced and very bland which is not something I associate with true Mexican food. The salsa is bland. The chips were bland. My entree was so bland I don't even remember what I ordered. You'd be better off going to an authentic place where you can get big SEASONED portions for a much better price. I guess I'm biased because I grew up eating Mexican food as my family is Hispanic but I'd recommend not wasting your money."}
{"text":"I dig this place.  We've always gone for lunch, never dinner, but we've never been disappointed. With all the taco options, there is always something new to try, and there are a lot of fun and intriguing taste combos. Boring it is not, which is a good thing.

Service has been lower-OK. Usually a bit slow, once or twice a bit forgetful, but always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is an excellent little place right in the center of Scottsdale's shopping district!  When I went, It was my first visit and I wasn't sure what I wanted to try.  I asked the waitress--her name was emily---to surprise me.  She brought me three excellent tacos (street tacos style).  I can't remember which she brought but they were so good, i had her surprise me with three more!    The food and service is excellent here!"}
{"text":"Ok first of all... we waited like 20-30 minutes for drink refills. And an hour after being seated for our order to be taken... I ordered the ceviche which btw comes with shrimp, pick de Gallo, lime juice, and cilantro. Was brought out with no pick de Gallo. When I asked for some .... the waitress brought out a shot of chopped tomatoes. Are you fucking serious?! Look. I'm not an asshole and was a server for 2 yrs. this was total bullshit. Don't go here. Like ever. They suck. We had a group of 10 and 6 were unhappy with our orders and service."}
{"text":"Some really good Mexican food, in old Scottsdale.  Cool vibe, food was fresh and drinks were really good as well."}
{"text":"Went here for the 3rd time tonight. The food is mediocre at best. Most dishes that include meat are overfilled with non-meat ingredients. The food is bland. I have liked the mole enchiladas on one visit. The staff is super busy. The biggest irritation I had was the kids menu says for $6.95 they get a main dish, a side, a drink, and dessert. When we requested dessert the staff said it's $1 more per child. It's not a money issue but read your own menu! Chips and Salsa with drinks with friends it's great. Kids and family dinner I would steer clear."}
{"text":"I ordered tacos my first time and I only got one, very small 4 inch taco. Be sure and specify how many tacos. Obviously it wasn't enough food but it did have great flavor and texture. The salsa could be spicier. The guacamole is incredible."}
{"text":"Worth going for the fresh made chips and salsa alone. They have about 21 types of tacos on the menu. They have a big menu. I had Horchata and Melissa had Hibiscus water. Giant Margarita glass full. Then I had the 3 taco's for 10.00 and she had 2 of her own. I had Al Pastor, the Shrimp taco, and the Chicken Barrio. Melissa had Carnitas and a Fish. Melissa said the Fish was \"one damn good taco\" and the Carnitas was good. For me, the Chicken was OK, because I don't care for creamy sauce in a taco - messy and drippy. The shrimp was good, but nowhere near the Tortilla Fish shrimp taco. The Al Pastor was great. I will definitely get that one again. Service was slow. Food took a while, but the chips and salsa are great. After we asked for the check it took a long time to get it and the waitress kept forgetting the to-go containers, etc."}
{"text":"Okay so on a Sunday mission for some easy lunch, 3 of us see a new restaurant in desert ridge and decide to go on and try it out! We put our names down at 3pm almost exactly and were told to wait in the \"lounge\" outside and someone will bring us drinks while we wait. Sounded like a good deal to us, so we agreed to wait. We went into the lounge and sat down adjacent to the patio area where you order food. We all three quickly noticed that they were not really that busy. I myself am a server and was astonished to see about 12 servers/bussers working but only about 4 tables seated, while we were forced to wait 35 minutes for a table. 
Mean while, we were not greeted by a server or cocktail waitress so after close to 15 minutes of waiting we decided to walk to the bar and grab our own drinks. Not a huge deal whatever. 
Finally we were texted about our table being ready so we proceeded inside. Sat down at a nice table under a tree for (we counted) 22 minutes before we had to ask someone to see our server. Oh, and never forget the few bees buzzing around our table the whole time. We asked the hostess to grab our server, she asked us who our server was, without hesitation all at once the three of us said \"we have no idea\". 
After a few minutes a very friendly server came up to our table and we ordered every single thing we wanted all at once. 
About 20 minutes later our table side guac was starting to arrive and our waters. 
The lady preparing the guac moved so slow which was not a surprise because every time a table got up it took 3 bus boys and 5 minutes to clean one table. 
Once the guac was done, she placed it on the table, bowl covered in guac and the chunkiest guac I've ever tasted. 
I thought well maybe I'll just try it and it'll be fine, so I tried it. So not guacamole. I could excuse it though. Until not even 10 minutes after the guac hit the table our entrees came out along with the nachos we ordered that we wanted as an app. 
My mother in laws enchiladas were cold and inedible, beans lukewarm at best. Same with my mashed potatoes under my chicken. 

Needless to say our business has been lost. I hope this place can get it together, and fast. No I didn't talk to a manager because honestly I wasn't sure who was the manager and the issue did seem to be management anyways. We left at 5pm. 

By about 5:30 1/3 of us felt sick, assuming the fish taco for some reason had some shrimp contamination and enflamed his shell fish allergy or something of the sort. 

Be careful everyone!
Good luck out in this world barrio queen."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  We loved the simmered pork.  Taquitos were good, too.  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Good deal on margaritas!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this: if you have NEVER heard of Mole this is not the place for you. If you like Filiberto's you should reconsider. If you view Arribas as upscale dining, then keep driving. If the idea of paying $15 for a margarita makes you cringe find another place to eat. This is NOT a dining experience you will enjoy if you said yes to any of the above and is probably why you see some 1-3 star reviews. The food is fresh, the menu is creative, and this is not your typical run-of-the-mill Arizona Mexican food. I actually liked Barrio Queen better then Barrio Cafe. First time: had the Queen Enchiladas with chicken. Very light and rich at the same time. Green salad was delish! Slightly limey and sweet. The carne asada was tender and the flavor of the carnitas off the hook. Service was excellent. Kids even loved the hot dogs and fries. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and loved it. The whole place is cool with a huge patio. 

We started with chips and salsa with table side hand made guac. My wife had a fish taco and a chicken taco. She LOVED the fish. I had three tacos, carnitas, chili relleno, and carne asada. All three were great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy hour menu!! Margaritas are off da chain, great atmosphere and service! I'll be back when In the AZ.."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the yellow bar!! Bartender walked by me several times and looked right at me..said nothing. .i finally had to ask for water and a menu. .bar had like 5 people"}
{"text":"Brought several people to Barrio Queen.  Excellent food and presentation.  The Chile Relleno is amazing...but only for those who haven't been hooked on American deep fried rellenos.  Add some steak to it and enjoy.  The burrito was also huge, tasty and filling.  The Cadillac Margaritas were great and paired well with table side guacamole. 

5 stars on the drinks and food.  

It's a bit noisy inside with the lower concrete ceiling, but there are plenty of tables outside for when the weather is nice.   

This is the second time I have brought family to the restaurant and everyone seemed impressed with the authentic Mexican food. 

No reservations accepted...come early with larger groups.  

As a large group with a few kids, we asked for and waited for a booth.  Inevitably, the hostess forgot and walked us to the high top table...those don't work with high-chairs and kids.  

Nevertheless, a nice experience and in a great location for an after-dinner stroll."}
{"text":"So delicious! They have amazing ceviche and guacamole and their tacos are bomb. We went on a Thursday and they had this awesome band playing. The decor is great, really neat place. The wait is ridiculously long so be prepared to wait or go early. We went at 6 and it was an hour long wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. The guacamole is delicious they make it at your table. There is a steak salad with goat cheese that's amazing with a huge portion of meat it. We love the margaritas. whenever we go it's a safe that we're gonna have a good experience"}
{"text":"My daughter went with her grandmother and grandfather to this restaurant. I am appalled at the experience my little girl had. My in-laws are a inter-racial couple, and were treated so badly because of that. They were sat at a table, no one came to help them. Another couple was sat next to them, they had their order and drinks brought right away. My in-laws still have not been greeted, then when they said something and they asked for a manager the hostess brought a waitress. The waitress had an attitude and said \"I guess I can help you, what do you want?\". When they tried to leave the manager came out and comped them their starter but sat them away from all other customers so they couldn't be heard if complaining. 
This is outrageous! In 2015, in Arizona we have to worry about my daughter learning about racism at such a young age. A black man and white woman cannot be served like everyone else? I will never eat here and I hope no one else does either. An establishment like this should not be allowed to be in business."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of the reviews, I can see why it was rated lower due to the \"wait.\" We went on a Wednesday night and were told we had a 20-minute wait and almost decided to find another restaurant.  We could see the restaurant was PACKED and decided to stay.  I'm very glad we did, because the food was very good.  They started with the salsa and tortilla chips- which was so FRESH, it was still warm and crispy.  I had the 3-tacos with different choice of meats, which were all very good.  Our server was very friendly, and offered suggestions on what to eat.  The only thing that I found may be an issue (but not enough to take away a 'star'), is the use of 'skulls' in the paintings and other decor of the restaurant, which may be a little scary for young children."}
{"text":"If you are visiting the Valley & enjoy Mexican food be sure to go here.  We have dined at many Mexican food restaurants over the decades and this place is in the top five. 
Get the homemade guacamole. Our server, Juan, was a great showman & he wheeled out a cart with the ingredients & prepared a huge bowl. You can make a meal of it. Pay attention & you can prepare it at home.
We had the 3 for $10 tacos (incredibly tasty) & the Mex chick soup. 
The wine is pricey at $13 a glass but well worth it."}
{"text":"Ate at Barrio Queen tonight and was disappointed. Had previously been going to taco Tuesday at Joyride and had much faster service and better food there. Don't plan on returning to barrio queen. it is not as good as barrio Café"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype was about, I heard \"Best Mexican food!\". Super underwhelmed, and I am trying to think of a good part of dinner. Tried 3 cocktails, nothing worth writing about. Carne Asada Entree was more like beef jerky, tried 3 different tacos, none of which I had more than 2 bites of. All in all it was an $80 dinner and not worth it. Didn't bother mentioning anything to the server as we could tell all staff was new, and he was quite flustered for whatever reason. Managers seemed to just stand around. Plan for a long meal, 30 min ticket times, chips are super greasy and they give you more than you need, while salsa portions are small, and the second serving you get will be much smaller (which we never asked for). Drinks are poured short, if I poured a drink like this at my work I'd for sure hear a complaint. We have no reason to go back, as we left, not one of the (no joke) 5 girls at the hostess stand said \"goodbye\" or \"thank you\". I understand they're new but even if they get their act together, the food isn't worth the $ or time."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it was amazing!  We started with the nachos. The cheese and pork green chili were absolutely delicious. The Arizona Burrito was only half eaten and the rest made great leftovers. The Veggie Taco and Grilled Shrimp Taco was also great. However, the Carne Asada Taco wasn't great. The meat was a little over cooked and dry. Over all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I've heard so much about the Barrio Cafe in Phoenix but this place ruined my Saturday night dinner. Margaritas are small and food was disgusting."}
{"text":"this place is reaaallllllllll sexy. As a guy who likes to binge drink all day and wind up barfing in a golf course port-a-john, I enjoy this place. Not saying they over serve or anything, but to get that nice buzz cooking, this is the place. Their Mexico water drinks (margaritas) are off the chain. Have a couple of those huns and then cruise onto a luscious beer (Bud Light) to really warm up. I ate their once because I felt if I didn't eat, I would die. The food is good too. Sit at the bar, get some of that chip N dip on and have yourself a good ol time. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUU!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is only rated 3 and a half stars! it's our new favorite mexican restaurant. The pork here is amazing!! The cochinita pibil dish is the best pork i've had and there are many other dishes (enchiladas, tacos) that you can have the pork in. The chicken enchiladas were also delicious and the margaritas are authentic with lime juice, no sweet and sour mix here! We sat outside on the patio which has heat lamps so it was comfortable for the winter and there was live music which made it a great evening! We will definitely be back and try the other locations!"}
{"text":"Food was good! The service was not good. They kept trying to take Queso appetizer away when we still had 1/2 of it left. We couldn't find waitress to pay the bill. The drinks were good!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. Our server, Juan, made the best guacamole we have ever tasted. The tacos were fresh and delicious, too."}
{"text":"The food has no flavor. I got 3 tacos: pescado asado, camaron asado and carne asada y Chile relleño.  So bland. No flavor. No spice. I tried a bite of everyone's food at the table and it was all so bland. The coctel de elote appetizer was so flavorless. Even the salsa wasn't spicy. One person had some kind of enchiladas with a green sauce that was almost tasty. 

I just don't know how one can make so many Mexican dishes with no flavor. So overpriced and disappointing."}
{"text":"Today we spent a wonderful afternoon with the crew at Barrio Queen the Happy Hour menu was very tasty and the drinks were very reasonable. The Wait Staff sure we're on their game today, the Manager made his way inside and out chatting with Patrons, he went out of his way as we were leaving to thank us for our patronage. We were a party of six. Three sisters and husbands we are all boomers. Your staff left us to catch up but the minute something was needed or drinks refilled they were there. Thank You so much for the wonderful afternoon."}
{"text":"After all of the hype, we finally made our way to Barrio Queen for a night out for 2 families...overall the food and experience was unimpressive. The menu was unique with lots of offerings, but the food that we ordered was just OK. I ordered the Chilis En Nogada and found that a very similar dish (stuffed poblano pepper) offered at Z Tejas was much better in comparison (Z Tejas has always been hard to beat!)

While the restaurant was busy on a Sunday evening at 5 PM, the service was incredibly SLOW! We ordered the table side made guacamole to have with our chips and salsa and the server finally made into our table to make it after the entrees had arrived??? We ordered desert (kids churros, churros and ice cream and tres leches cake) and found them all to be once again just OK...that it once they finally arrived, our check had been sitting  at our table a good 5-10 minutes before our desserts were delivered. 

The patio was comfortable and nice and one of the few high points of the restaurant. The next time that we crave some unique Mexican fare, we will probably head elsewhere...but I might give a patio Happy Hour a try?"}
{"text":"Googled top restaurants in Scottsdale and this one pulled up. Took my husband and children there for dinner and absolutely feel in love. So many little street taco to choose from and mix and match. Arizona burrito was best burrito I've had in my life"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, service not bad. This is a very modern creative approach to Mexico cousine. We had the guacamole for appetizer which the waitress prepared table side it was a bit chunky but very flavorful. California enchilada was exploding with nice flavor. Tacos were very small more like sliders size but very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food, huge menu with a good selection. Tuesday's are 4 tacos for $10, great deal! Service was a little slow but everything else was very good"}
{"text":"The best michelada in town. 

But from there... the food is just not good.... at all. The original location in Old Town is different than this one.  
The new locations are more \"chain\" like with the food.  Gluey, wet burritos.... ok salsa and guacamole... 
their street tacos do shine.  
The chips are horrible and who can't make good chips? Nothing else is spectacular either, just meh...I want this place to do great because we live very close and it is LOCALLY OWNED!!"}
{"text":"Concerned now that Silvana has left and gringos own the place.  Silvana was the heart and soul, now they are at airports and believe me it will not be the same .  Thank god we still have the Barrio cafe to go to."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying it is a beautiful venue.  The five bartenders are  constantly busy.  I would say the tequila sells 85% of the liquor.  We had Don Julio margaritas (tequila, lime juice, agave syrup) the correct way to make a margarita, they were perfect.  The chips are excellat as is the salsa.  The quac was wonderful with pomegranate seeds in it.  We had tacos, wifes vege taco was great, my El Pastor pork taco was spicy an great.  The fried shrimp could have been a little spicer All in all it was a perfect evening. OH our barmaid was so friendly and k nowledgeable They have tacos, burros, soups, salads and main entrees.  NOW understand this  is not a $2 taco joint but its well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Phoenix and came on recommendation from locals - Yelp 3 star rating does not do this place justice. Great decor and comfortable chairs. We were told 15 min wait, pleasantly surprised with 10!

Fresh chips and salsa, great drinks (dos equis mug and margarita special). I got the margarita on recommendation of server - did not disappoint. 

Tableside guac was amazing. Fresh, different and tasty. You can add tomato, jalapeño, cilantro, onion, pomegranate seeds or in any combo. 

Food was outstanding. Carne asada had big portion, great taste and preparation. I was between Arizona burrito and Carnitas Michoacanas, went with latter on servers recommendation. Tender pork, very tasty. 

If I'm being super picky we waited a little longer than perfect for service. Still not enough to take away from 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, Victor's Prickly Pear with Orange Blossom water margarita (off the menu) is AMAZING!! Best margarita I've ever had! If you can, sit at the bar. Great service. The food is phenomenal. My new favorite place in downtown Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service not so great.  Very disappointed.  Staff seems to be tripping over one another, lacks customer focus."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Party of 5 adults for birthday. Quickly seated very few others there. Took a few minutes and PILAR came to table. Drinks and chips in fairly short order as did refills. Orders were a different matter! Think 3 of the 5 were received different than desired. My Hamburguresa was ordered with no bun and was received long after the other 4. One wanted veggies instead of rice - you guessed it. Did receive a veggie side replacement BEFORE  my burger. No negatives on food or drink taste. Not sure if server, kitchen or both problem but first time I can remember leaving less than 18% tip. With so many fine Mexican restaurants around WHY BOTHER?"}
{"text":"It's a busy place, but I did not have an enjoyable experience here.   I have a tomato allergy high puts enormous limitations on what I can have, but have always been given safe alternatives at any other restaurant I have ever gone to.  

At Barrio Queen, I was given dry chicken on a dry corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese and a smattering of sour cream.    There was a total lack of creativity or effort to please the customer. 

I was definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Good ambiance. Good food for the most part. But I ordered a chicken chorizo torta. It came on some kind of bread that the waitress couldn't really describe so I asked that they sub a tortilla. Pretty simple. What I got after my party of 8 was done eating was a tortilla slathered in melted cheese with a bunch of dried out chicken on top. A quesadilla??? I told waitress it wasn't what I asked for & she brought manager who absolutely insisted I had to wait for the version I had asked for. I explained I had already eaten half of someone else's meal which wAs excellent btw. I said I didn't want anything else but after another wait I was presented with the same thing with some dried out chorizo & pico. Yuck.  I've had excellent tacos & meals at barrio queen in Gilbert. They may have the same disgusting torta on the menu- idk. Moral of the story: Order tacos here.  Was disappointed in how manager handled situation too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here, all of the food in our party of 6 looked delicious. I had the steak burrito and the table side guacamole. The burrito was awesome but the table side guacamole wasn't up to par with other places I have been I thought. I would want to go back again to try some of the street tacos."}
{"text":"Chili Verde appetizer was delicious.  Chips are thick and good.  Waiter was great,Justin was friendly and informative,and so helpful.  Tacos were good but kind of soggy. Happy hour is nice with the price of tacos & appetizers."}
{"text":"I love trying new places to eat! Mexican food is my favorite!  Plus I am 7 months pregnant so the baby is picky lol! The whole atmosphere was classy yet casual .I felt like I could go there in a business dress or jeans and a t shirt. The first thing I notices was how fresh the salsa was .They brought out two different kinds ...One a little more spicy then the other.The more spicy one was my pick! The chips were cookies fresh and served hot...I ordered the brisket enchiladas!  They were amazing ! And the portion was huge!!!! No way to eat it all in one sitting! ! The brisket was so tender and the sauce was creamy and yummy! I also appreciated how fast the service was since we were on our lunch break from work!  The food came quick. ..and the check was brought promptly. The manager on duty was Josh. He was very friendly and came to our table and checked on us .Just the right amount to show he was aware of us and taking care of our needs...but also not coming over to many times to interrupt. .Everything was very clean and food was very fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the many options for tacos. Though they were fairly expensive they are expertly made. I really enjoyed the ambiance and Scottsdale Waterfront is a cute area to walk around after dinner. An overall great experience, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A wonderfully warm fall evening led to some outdoor dining here at the Queen and it wasn't even Tuesday. Since it was another day of the week, we tried some other dishes instead. First off the chips and salsa are quite good and still free and the $6 mug of Horchata is worthy because of it's unique creaminess.
    As for main courses, my chicken mole was good enough, but did not reach epic levels due to just basically a lack of flavor. It wasn't spicy, but wasn't sweet either, so it just fell kind of flat. The other entree was more warmly received and that was the brisket enchiladas with a green sauce blanket. The meat was shredded and free of fat. It's always nice to eat a meal outside and this time of year, you can gaze at the Xmas lights while dining as a bonus."}
{"text":"Terrific atmosphere on the patio last Sat night
Great server and we loved the food
And we are not usually Mexican food eaters
We have eaten there before and again they did not disappoint 
The guacamole is the best bar none - made at your table too
The flan was superb and hubby loves the mole sauce
We say bravo!"}
{"text":"Nothing more frustrating than being quoted an hour and 15 min wait, but standing and staring at 4 open tables sitting there unoccupied for more than 30 minutes. These tables were right in the front too, so it was pure inefficiency and lack of urgency that caused them to sit empty. Ridiculous... Funny thing is, when we were finally seated, they placed the two of us at a 4 top table when there were three open 2 top tables available. Clueless."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with a twist! The table-side avocado has great flavor and is made to your level of spice tolerance. It comes with dried cranberries, which sounded odd but tasted really good in it. The chips are homemade and the salsa has good flavor to it. There about 20 tacos to choose from in addition to many other specialty dishes. The pork carnita and the carne asada tacos were delicious! They have a variety of tequilas and specialty drinks to choose from. A great addition to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I have been spoiled at the other location in Phx.  We had the conchita pibil I think is what they call it not sure but it was great there so we happened upon this place in Scottsdale and thought we would give it a try.  

I got a chicken burrito that was ok but I would never get it again if I did happen to go back.  My husband got a 3 taco plate which was either $3.50 a taco or 10.00 for 3 and when it came out it was shockingly small next to my burrito that was just a regular size.  My husband says they were approximately 1-2 bite tacos and honestly that is not an exaggeration.

He finished his $10 tacos in 10 seconds flat still starving and asked to see the menu again.  He has never had to order another meal after eating a meal before just to satisfy his hunger.  This time we tried the appetizer I think it was carnitas that was soaked in coca cola or something.  It sounded good but it did not taste good.  The meat was extremely fatty and some pieces overcooked and tough even black.  I took 2 bites just to give it a fair shot but no just not good and he felt the same so the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill.

The manager came over and we told her how we felt in the nicest way possible.  She thanked us for the feedback and then told us that she hoped we would try them again even after we said honestly after this experience we wouldnt be back.  Maybe we just made all the wrong choices.  Who knows?  I guess we won't find out."}
{"text":"We have been to this establishment twice now. The first time we loved it and enjoyed great tacos and amazing drinks. This time, not so much. Sub par at best and overpriced. To start our evening we waited about a half hour as we had thought it would be worth the wait. We were greeted by a hostess that could have cared less to say hello or even wait for us to sit down. Next, our waiter comes and doesn't even ask if it's our first time. He then proceeds to ask if we want drinks and we inquired about the drinks they had, he rolls his eyes and we then said we will just get waters to start. Clearly he had no patience and did not care to walk us through the drink menu. When he came back he asked if I liked margaritas and recommended me to the \"award winning\" margarita and the other two in our party ordered beer. The drinks came and WOW $11 for a watered down margaritas... what a joke. Smallest margarita I have ever had. Could totally understand if it was a house marg but a specialty one for $11 coming in a small glass, you have got to fix that. Rip of for sure. Now this is where things go from worse to even worse. We all ordered three tacos each, not even 3 or 4 minutes later our sub par tacos arrived. Holy buckets, they were cold and soggy. We asked for them to be heated up (server rolled eyes again) then received them back where they were thrown In the microwave (fn gross) like really? You couldn't spend all of two minutes remaking the tacos to make things right. Yet, your server doesn't even ask if it came out better or offer any form of apology for our cold tacos. The chips we received prior to dinner were stale and hard (hurt our teeth) and clearly other reviews agree with that. Save your money and go somewhere that isn't going to rush you through the meal and where they care about the customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas and good food selection.  Fantastic wait staff.  Our waiter was Kirby and he was knowledgable about the food menu and the different kinds of tequila.  Highly recommend this location for food, drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place! The chips are authentic thick cut and fresh made. The salsa could be a bit hotter though. The margaritas are so good and with generous amounts of tequila. I have been twice and the last time I sat at the bar. Both times I received excellent customer service."}
{"text":"We did lunch here and what a great deal!  Tacos are $2.50 and margaritas are $3.00.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We shared a churro for dessert and that was delish!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Bus Boys standing around with their thumbs  up their butts  as plates pile. Food was barely warm. We had to ask multiple times for water. Food was not of the same quality as original location AT ALL! I will never return."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. They have an option for 3 tacos, you can mix and match which ones.  I had 3 different from my friends 3 and we both loved all of them and couldn't pick a favorite! The patio was so comfortable with the misters and happy hour was great.  My friends enjoyed it as much as I did.  We will all be back!"}
{"text":"God awful, their food is bland and their service is horrible. I had to ask for chips and salsa, the chips are large clumps of garbage, and the salsa is flavorless much like the rest of their overpriced food, and to think, I walked around hungry for 2 hours before deciding on this less than classy joint. The wait for a table was 1 1/2 hour, couldn't find a seat at the bar for at least an hour. No one has time for that when they're hungry!!

The hosts walk around yelling their reservation names, and if that doesn't make your cringe, they also go out on the sidewalk yelling out their reservation names. But hey, let's get back to the boring food here. Their ice tea tastes like sh**! I think I'm going to be sick.

The plates come with black beans and no rice. I've never been served a plate of Mexican food without refried beans and rice. This place flat out sucks. I'm convinced that there's no such thing as good Mexican food in the Phoenix Metro area. I've lived here for 5 years now and just about every Mexican food place out here SUCKED! I hate this Sonoran garbage. Eating cardboard would be more flavorful than this crap. Can't wait to go back to Texas. This sonoran BS leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Great food - awesome guacamole bowl that they home make at the table.  Received excellent service from Kadee - way above and beyond."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere = 5 stars. Service = 2 stars.  Fabulous happy hour on the patio. Combined with their guacamole, this was a very satisfying and enjoyable experience. The waiter seemed a bit miffed that we didn't order hundreds of dollars worth of alcohol (my buddy only had two drinks) and even cleared our food before we were finished. I understand trying to turn a table, but come in!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good but nothing special. I thought this place would be incredible because of the hype. The chips and salsa were so good and the best part of our experience! The guac was overpriced and not flavorful. The tacos were decent!! Overall it was a fun experience and atmosphere, but this place doesn't blow everywhere else out of the water."}
{"text":"I always love going here on weekends for chillaquilles
Awesome service, great margaritas and awesome food !
The waterfront location is a plus ! Street tacos are to die for , I've had them all but the Pastor takes me back to the time I lived in Mexico! This food is authentic so don't expect Tex Mex!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. While I usually just sample various tacos, today I got the Pollo Coco and it was amazing. 2 chicken breast w/ a wonderful sauce served w/ pine nuts and a side of mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. I will be trying more entrees from now on. Good food, good service and an overall enjoyable experience as usual. Love the brisket, chicken and carne tacos. So many choices of tacos also. Nice patio to sit outside in Old Town."}
{"text":"We came to Barrio based on a recommendation from a local and were so impressed!! The food is amazing- so fresh. Definitely order the guacamole; it's made at your table and you pick the ingredients. I could have eaten that for the entire meal. We both got different variations of tacos- incredible!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, it was pretty tasty! We got there at 6:00pm on today, Sunday. No wait, we were being taken to a corner, but I requested one of the larger booths that were open and looked a little more comfortable. We waited about 5 minutes before we were asked if we want water, well hell yeah it's Arizona! About 5 minutes went by and we got water and chips and salsa. Finally, cough, cough water! I wasn't impressed by the chips or the salsa. Chips were kind of thick and cold. Not what I expected at all. They were chewy too, no snap when you bit into them. The salsa was good but being the salsa commissioner it had nothing to excite me. Kind of tomato sauce with oinions chopped in. We asked for another salsa and they brought a tomatillo with a habanero kick, okay now we're talking salsa. 
My husband and I got the Arizona burrito and 4 tacos. The burrito was a pork green chili with a lite sauce on it. They add a Mexican crema and red onions on top. It was delish! Slow roasted pork in a variety of spice along with orange juice. It was worth its weight in gold. We split it and still took some home. We got 3 fish tacos and 1 carne asada, though they are smaller than street tacos, they were chucked full of meat and or fish, they weren't skimpy at all. My husband could barely finish his 3 tacos. The fish was succulent and tasty. The carne asada didn't disappoint either. We took half the burrito home. I will be back for another round, very tasty! The service was slow to get to the table, but once there she did a marvelous job. She made sure to offer another round, check to see if we needed anything extra. I'm only doing 3 stars due to chips and salsa, the time it took to recognize the table and bathroom was messy."}
{"text":"We literally waited 25 mins to be approached.. after being seated.  It was by far the worst service I've experienced.  I had to get up three times to grab someone to take our drink order....order an appetizer and then our meal.  I always give the benefit of the doubt but come on I was embarrassed for them."}
{"text":"First time at Barrio Queen and had only heard good reviews about it. Came around 11:30 for lunch. Service was so-so but friendly. I ordered three tacos: pescado asado, carne asada y huevo, and barrio pollo, and a side of rice. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the flavors of the food. The barrio pollo probably had the best flavor, but was dripping in sauce. Carne asada was disappointing and bland. Pescado asado was decent. The rice wasn't anything spectacular and I wouldn't spend the extra $3 again. Overall, not the best food experience. Wished there was more flavors all around. Not sure if I will try it again."}
{"text":"Great vibe!  Very busy for opening night and being Cinco de mayo.  Tacos and cevechi were good.  Great addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not really what we wanted. We liked the salsa and chips were homemade. Tacos were not even close to what I wanted in a taco. Not sure if I'll be back but the atmosphere and service was above average."}
{"text":"Opening day: as a reviewing patron, I always feel a bit guilty to fault a restaurant for poor service or inconsistent food on such a tough day. It's ballsy for the operators of Barrio Queen (motto-\"comida a toda madre\") to take on the day after Christmas to open at this Scottsdale Waterfront location, most recently home to the long-suffering Metro Brasserie. Given this brashness, I opted to proceed with drafting the following first impression.

As a trial run, my partner and I decided to just order three tacos apiece. There are over 50 combinations of taco filings to choose from, with some ingredients (e.g., barbacoa, lengua (beef tongue)) available only on weekends. All meats and tortilla are made in-house, according to our waiter--impressive.

I opted for al pastor, nopal y chile verde (cactus and pork), and champiñon y huevo (mushroom and egg). The pastor was very tasty and tender, but the fresh pineapple chunks were a bit distracting: the fruit was definitely not roasted with the meat, as is typical for authentic pastor, and a little caramelization was all it needed. The cactus and veg were slightly pickled-tasting and delicious, though the chile verde a bit dry (my partner had a similar experience with his colorado). The mushrooms, sauteed with shallots and topped with a salt-and-pepper egg, were awesome. Despite the \"street taco\" sizing, I was satisfied with three as a heavy snack because the toppings were so generous. For this same reason, though, I gave up on trying to gingerly lift the dainty tortilla discs up to my mouth and pulled out the knife and fork.

As mentioned, first days are difficult, and to my chagrin, the tacos came out haphazardly over the course of about 35 minutes. After our meal, I had a hankering for something sweet, especially because the restaurant window and menu characterized BQ as part panaderia, I peeked in at the display counter next to the front door; alas, the shelves were mostly bare and looked more like a prep station than bakery display. Overall, I am excited by the storefront take-out window, though: it reminds me of the cafeterias you see in front of Cuban restaurants in Miami. Maybe it will be a go-to place for late night cafe con leche and croquetas. Here's to hoping."}
{"text":"Location isn't everything. Had to stand up after 10 minutes to find a waiter to take our order. Chips and salsa came out seconds before the food. Isaac was a good waiter but he did not make up for the poor and over priced food. They even messed up the chips and salsa which is very hard to accomplish."}
{"text":"I love Barrio Queen's happy hour.  It starts at TWO!! and lasts 4 hours, AND is offered on weekends!!
Admittedly, I have only really eaten off the happy hour or apps menu. But when in rome, why stray from the tacos? They're PERFECT! At 3 for $10, I almost always order two fish tacos and one shrimp. The beer battered fish is so delicious and tasty and so perfect to enjoy with thier margaritas. Despite other reviews, I argue that three are plenty to fill you up if you are looking to spend $10 on tacos, it is exactly what you should expect. 
The tableside guacamole is a bit of an unnecessary presentation, but the end result is all we care about right? And Barrio Queen delivers on its guac!
The pork dip appetizer is also very tasty, but a little too much fat for my tastes. I'm not a superfan of pork. 

Regarding the service --- be nice, and they'll be nice back.  You can tell some of these folks have been around the block and are not a fan of catering to Scottsdale's elitist jerks.  But when you are friendly, smile-y, and honest -- you can be promised excellent service with a smile. 

The ambience -- sit outside, just do it!! It is beautiful out there, there is usually live music playing nearby on the Cowboy Ciao corner or right at the canal.  Its just great to people watch and be watched by those who wish it was thier own taco time. Bring a coat in winter, and you'll still be happy. I've waited twenty minutes at the bar just to be able to dine outside. This is one of my favorite patios in old town.

Crowd is a total mixed vibe. Partiers still awake from last night right next to the snowbirds from Michigan, alongside a few baseball players and trophy wives. I've been fortunate that for the handful of times I've been here, I've never once seen any children of the annoying age group that make your meal distracting and keep your voice hushed.

I have no idea why Barrio Queen has ever been rated with less than 4 stars. Yes, I'm fairly easy to please when there is great outdoor seating and guacamole, but still - I think all around it is a great spot to check out and spend a few hours drinking house margs and munching on some tacos. :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and vibe was very nice!... Until out server came by. Schilee was not interested in the slightest in helping us order or even try to be friendly in any way. The tableside guacamole sounded like a good menu item, until we got a bowl of avocado chunks with all of the other ingredients and what seemed like a quart of lime juice. We really wish that we would have had a better experience, considering all of the good reviews we have heard from friends, but that dream did not come true. Instead we had a sassy, short, and closed off waitress that seemed as if she couldn't wait for us to leave from the moment we sat down.. which is exactly what we did. After our appetizers, we were out of there. Too bad. :/"}
{"text":"Sloppy. The guacamole was good, but our water just cut up the avocado, didnt mash it. The tacos were not visually pleasing nor were they appetizing. I rarely not finish my plate. But left two tacos barely touched. Skip this."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!!!! Fantastic food!!! Sherri was our server and I couldn't imagine coming here again and not getting her. She was warm, and so friendly it made my experience at thos restaurant 1 million times better. Once again food was awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to check out this new Barrio Queen last Friday. I'd heard that the service wasn't the best when they first opened but I figured it was a new restaurant and had some kinks to work out. When we arrived around 8:30, the restaurant was packed but we were promptly seated on the patio. It was at least 20 minutes before our server even came over to greet us. Thankfully since my friend and I were catching up we didn't notice for the 10 minutes or so, and if the server stepped it up after that, I wouldn't be writing this review... my friend and I kinda joked that we have never had such an awkward server. But not only was he awkward and would mumble odd comments about us partying up after we ordered drinks... every time he left he would disappear for a ridiculous amount of time. Honestly, I saw the other tables servers at least 3 times before our server came back around. When we finally got our food dropped off by a runner, I had to ask her to send our waiter over because our drinks had been empty for some time. Also, we never received silverware or napkins until we had to ask after our main course arrived. (I kept looking around for silverware when we were eating appetizers but the server was no where to be found.) I was getting so frustrating with the absent server, that I was standing up to go order a drink from the bar when he finally came back around. In case he disappeared again, I actually ordered two drinks this time around. Our simple dinner and drinks for 2 lasted 2 and a half hours because of the slow service. I will say that everything else was great, the food and drinks were delicious. And I would be more understanding if it was super busy and it seemed like the server was busy or stressed out. But this guy was no nonchalant about everything, like he had all the time in the world. Oh I'll add in for my friend, it was driving her crazy, he wouldn't write any of our order down and he kept forgetting things (like silverware and drinks). The thing that really drove me nuts was that even when the restaurant calmed down and there were only a handful of tables left - our server was still MIA. At the end of the day, especially for a $100 tab for 2 people - I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm reading about the bad service experiences and what a bummer! The service we received was the only reason I felt compelled to write a review! I wish I remembered her name, but the server from Alaska is fantastic. If BQ can find 15 of the Alaska gal, the ratings would sky rocket...! 

We came on a weekday and the wait times were long- expect it at any of the restaurants in DT Gilbert.. We decided to brave the weather and sat on the patio. It was well shaded and had misters- not bad! We started with guac- Try it with all of the add-ins. I wasn't sure about adding the cranberries but YUM! Really fantastic! Only downer there was that chips were a bit oily still... But I'll take them over bagged tortilla chips any day.

I ordered California enchiladas- sauce was excellent.. Enchiladas were possibly pre-made(?)- the cheese was firm but it was fine. Black beans and veggies were great! Portion was large- I needed help finishing. Boyfriend ordered tacos and practically inhaled them. He still raves about the chorizo and egg taco. House margaritas were fine, not memorable. 

Overall, I'd say BQ is above average...! Some items are a bit pricey and we wouldn't come here just to have drinks... but we had good food and really great service!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Service was slow. Lots of staff walking around and NOT filling empty beverages."}
{"text":"We are the people that Christy C. is complaining about in her review.

It is important to note that this restaurant has an outdoor dog-friendly patio, one of the reasons we enjoy coming here. The staff has always been very nice to our puppy treating him as if he were one of the family. 

In addition to this, the food at Barrio Queen is unique and inventive, definitely not typical fare.  They bill themselves as a unique restaurant and tequileria and they do not disappoint. The food is creatively delicious, and the drinks strong. 

Being vegetarians, we are delighted by the fresh vegetables and vegetarian options on the menu. We have enjoyed eating at Barrio Queen many times with our pooch in tow, and especially enjoy the enchiladas and in house-made corn tortillas used in the tacos. 

This particular evening, Christy C.'s husband started shouting, complaining first to the server, then the manager, and finally, still unsatisfied, approached our table and began verbally abusing my family and me whipping out his iPhone to snap pictures of the quesadilla--consuming canine. 

He seemed to be looking for a fight, and after hurling more insults, My husband was about to take a deep look into this person's dark soul to see whether or not he needed a facial readjustment when the manager rushed to our rescue and called the police.

Needless to say, we were mortified that our dog would be the cause of such a scene. Our dinner would have been completely ruined were it not for the kindness of the manager Jeff and his staff. My mother-in-law is still in pieces over this, and we'll never feel the same about bringing our dog anywhere.

One is entitled to one's opinion about how they feel about God's creatures, but if one finds them so disgusting, perhaps one shouldn't patronize the dog-friendly patio of a restaurant located in Gilbert, the city where dogs are always welcome!

This restaurant's rating should not suffer because Christy C. and her husband don't like dogs. In fact, their rating and review have little to do with the food and everything to do with the dog-friendly policy and the restaurant staff--seemingly a vain attempt to feel righteous about contemptible behavior.  

On the other hand, my family and I feel that Barrio Queen is a gastronomical feast coupled with a friendly atmosphere and great service, an unbeatable combination, indeed!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the last night we were in Arizona. We were seated relatively quickly although the restaurant seemed very busy. We were seated outside, and although it was very cold, there were propane fueled torch heaters that made it feel like I was sitting next to a fireplace. Super toasty and warm! Our server was awesome! I asked him to turn on one of the torch heaters behind me since the other ones' warmth originally didn't reach me. Although I was the only one really seated in that area, he was glad to. 

The salsa here is super fresh and flavorful. We cleared out the tortilla chip basket pretty fast.
Salsa. Our waiter told us Guy Fieri dropped by for an episode of diners drive-ins and dives, and I didn't feel any of those vibes here, but maybe it was because I was sitting outside?

I tried the Pollo en Crema Verde at suggestion of our awesome waiter. The chicken was juicy and although I generally don't like Mexican food flavors and spices, I actually thought the cream sauce was very tasty and kept dunking my chicken in it. The highlight is definitely the chipotle mashed potatoes. I just want a bowl od that alone! 

Entree portions are huge. If you're not that hungry, there's enough food to split!

tl;dr chipotle mashed potatoes are delicious, crema verde sauce is creamy goodness. sitting outside for dinner feels like eating next to a toasty warm fireplace thanks to the torch heaters. Service was very on point, helpful, and made good suggestions."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. The artwork is stunning (think Dia de Los Meurtos).

We ordered an appetizer of guacamole...AMAZING! the pomegranate seeds really made it a unique dish.

My son and I split the burrito Barrio pollo and also thr  chiles en nogado. Wow. So much flavor. My other son really enjoyed the Carnitas Michoacanas too. 

Our server, Fred, was right on with refills and recommendations. Also they had a live band playing that added to the ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch for the first time, sat at the bar. I ordered enchilada with optional shrimp which was $4 extra. And asked for chips & salsa right after the order. I was looking forward to the shrimp enchilada since it was $4 extra for the shrimps. When I got the food it had 3 shrimps on top of the 3 enchilada rows, bit disappointing but still good. I assumed the shrimps would be inside the enchilada but I should have asked. But was still waiting for the chips. Well they finally came out when I was pretty much done with my food. For the service and $20 dish? There are other places I can go for good mexican place on the same street that Ive been happier with."}
{"text":"I can't even explain how much I love the food and service here.  Best drinks at the bar.  Best smothered fries anywhere.  Great atmosphere.  People who work here enjoy their job.  Will eat here until the place falls to the ground."}
{"text":"Upon being seated, noted the table had not been wiped very well and only silverware/napkins for 2, we were a party of five. Our server seemed pretty disinterested the entire time. We had four different entrees, all just OK, the salad being the best of them. We brought family here from Seattle and they enjoying trying a new Mexican restaurant each time they visit. This was their least favorite and I agree. Not awful, just not good enough to make you want to return."}
{"text":"Friday evening. The place was busy, crowded, but not as bad as it would get later. We got there about 5 pm. Told it would be a 40 minute wait, but only about 15 in reality. The place is lively and had a good vibe.
Once seated, it took a LONG time to get any service. Eventually our waitress brought menus and took a drink order. Then a long time passed and the chips and salsa showed up. The drinks came later. The margarita (Casa Margarita) was dreadful. The beer warm. After a long wait, she comes back to take a food order. Then another long wait. The food was quite tasty, very fresh and appealing. Much like what you really do get in Mexico City, Oaxaca, and other places south of the border. Tex-Mex it is not. 
The food is good. But it's the service that makes me question whether I'll return. I don't know if there are too few wait people or what, but service was appallingly slow. The waitress, rather than working an area seemed to have tables scattered all over - very inefficient. In addition, she had to bring out a table on wheels and actually stand there and make some guacamole at a table which really slowed her down, and pissed me off because I needed a refill that she couldn't deal with at that time. The management definitely needs to retrain the wait staff, streamline their jobs, and get things moving. This place is a nice change from the tex-mex so common in Gilbert, but if it's going to survive, they need to radically speed up service. 
One last thing: I don't know what it is about restaurant design these days, but this is just another LOUD place. The hard floor makes it noisy and uncomfortable. Several of the newer places in the area suffer from this, like Snooze and Joyride. I get it that concrete is easy to clean and maintain, but it's so noisy. Put some carpeting it and deaden the sound."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I thought it was a little pricy for what I ordered. Would like to return to try something else."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. Their tacos are insanely good. Location is prime and the menu has a wide variety of things you can get. It's like a classy Mexican restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale! Service can be a bit slow when you're in a rush during your lunch hour at work but that is my only complaint. Other than that, I love the place. Viva Mexico!"}
{"text":"Every single time I have been - every single staff member is amazing and they all are so genuinely nice! From the hostess, food runner, server, and anyone who you see - they're happy to be there and want to make sure you enjoy your time there and your meal 

The Skinny Chola margarita is delicious!

If you order the guacamole - they bring a cart out with fresh ingredients and make it right there in front of you! That was super cool!

Every single dish I've tried there has been 5 stars! 

Most recently had a visit and am on a strict food restriction, which I'm still struggling with to find something to eat--- they were able to accommodate my weird request and made it super delicious at the same time! 

This place has such a relaxing atmosphere - sit outside or inside - outside they have misters or heaters when it gets chilly. 

There is a reason why there is always a wait --- 

5 stars and will always be returning! Thank you for such an awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"The famous table side made guacamole was more like slide sliced avocado mixed with other things. The michelada leaves a lot to be desired.. On the plus side the atmosphere, staff, and burrito was great!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Amazing food and incredible service. We sat at the bar and Kara took care of us. She was awesome, what great service!! Honestly it was the best service I've ever had at any restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Service here was awesome for us. Tacos here are amazing!!!  Fried egg on a street taco?!  Hell yes all day long!  Kids menu is good as well. All around good experience here, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here both for lunch and dinner and both meals were great. Did the taco platter both times as it is a great way to sample different foods. My favorites were the basically any of the pork tacos. Had the table side guacamole a well which was pretty good. Lastly, sitting on the patio this time of year is awesome."}
{"text":"Drinks were fair at best. Tacos were tasty but, taquito size  not taco size. No sides. Bartender did not want to be there and it showed in service or lack there of. Hope your not too thirsty or hungry.  They need to hire a Mexican cook to show them how to roast a pepper and peel the bitter skin before putting it into a taco too!"}
{"text":"Worst burrito I've ever had.  Ordered the Arizona.  The pork was dry and tough.  It was literally a few pieces of pork smothered in some kind of off tasting green tomatillo salsa.  The tortilla was then rolled up and a very thin layer of cheese melted on top with a smattering of onions dropped on.  A $5 burrito at any of the local 'bertos' puts this mess to shame.  And it was FIFTEEN DOLLARS.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Lived in Sonora, MX for five years. I was pleasantly surprised with the authenticity of the flavors! We will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice authentic atmosphere and superb Mexican artwork on walls. Phenomenal job in interior decor and design.
Food was poor. I ordered the California enchilada and being from Ca... not good. Their chips and salsa are very tasty. Authintic margaritas are bland. Tasted more like plain old lime juice over ice.
Service was overkill. Our waitress was constantly interrupting us to check on us. Very rude to do when it's obvious that we were in conversation. Felt rushed as well. We aren't at Taco Bell. Perhaps her past experience is from there.
Will not go back....."}
{"text":"Much better overall in atmosphere, decor and customer service than the Gilbert location.
We sat at the bar and both bartenders were somewhat personable.  They were busy though trying g to keep up with orders. We did have to address them to order and we were sitting right in front of them. The waiters in the restaurant area were more personable. We had street tacos which were okay. Nothing spectacular.  The bathrooms are bizarre and look out of place....like airport bathrooms....strange but very clean.
We will go back"}
{"text":"Really cool place. The food was so good.
And bartender Kara was legit. 
Thanks Kara. 
Wish they would open one of these in Cali."}
{"text":"Their guacamole is officially the best guacamole I've ever had in my life. It's a must have when you go to Barrio Queen. It has pomegranate in it - which you may think is weird - but it will truly change your life. Great food, service, & awesome atmosphere. Get here, now."}
{"text":"Victor & Dakota at the bar make the food even better if that's possible!  Two house margaritas, one beer, five tacos, and a big fat burrito...delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos with great variety.  Fresh pressed corn tortillas were sooo good and awesomely gluten free!"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous!!! Our waiter was amazing too- thanks Luis! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We remembered Bario Queen from several years ago and wanted to celebrate a birthday there.  Bad selection! This was not the Bario Queen of several years ago. It is a Bario Queen that has lost its way. It is a Bario Queen to which we would never return or recommend to anyone.  Service was unprofessional. They didn't know what wine they had or didn't have. Menu was pedestrian at best a bad attempt at Tex Mex at worst.  The chips were terrible. The food was worse. An experience we hope to never repeat."}
{"text":"My happy hour quesadilla and puerco verde cup were good. My wife liked her sandwich.   Her fries were not good but they were taken off the bill. Friend liked his enchilada mole. Another friend liked her chop chicken salad.   Drinks were all ice which bothered me. Service was good when he was around but we didn't see him often.  In other words, service was a problem. Not sure I can recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Bad food! Guac is flavorless and chips are thick and do not compliment the guac texture. Asked for a margarita four times and it never came. Never returning'!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a bourbon drinker and almost never have anything else but the only one they offer is Makers Mark. I understand that they specialize in tequila (over 300) but only one bourbon was still a disappointment. That said,  the margaritas are just incredible- highly suggest that you try one. The guacamole is prepared table-side and is oozing with freshness. I had 5 of their tacos as an entree (pork, salmon, chicken, cactus, and one other ?)... they were very good. 5 tacos may sound gluttonous, but they each can be eaten in 2 bites. All of the food was very fresh and you got a sense that it was prepared with care. Overall my party of 7 had a great meal (dinner) while sitting outside on the patio. If definitely suggest that you try this place for a fun, relaxed dinner with a seriously stiff drink."}
{"text":"If you are looking for legit Mexican food you have come to the right place. We started off with their table made guacamole which was wonderful. Their own twist is to add pomegranate seeds. I wasn't to sure about that till I tasted it. I will now add this to my own guacamole.
I tried the three taco plate with a carnitas taco, fried cod taco and a grilled shrimp taco. 

The carnitas taco was very nice. Plenty of tender pork served on a fresh street taco sized tortilla. Along with it was a slaw type salad and salsa verde on the side. Very nice and if you like pork I would recommend it.

The shrimp taco was sized the same as the carnitas taco. The shrimp was grilled and very moist. Served on a bed of slaw and very nice.

The fried cod taco was also wonderful. Again served on a street taco sized tortilla and a fresh cabbage slaw. I would say this was my favorite of the three."}
{"text":"OK I just HAVE to write a review for this one... because 

IT WAS SUCH A LET DOWN!!!!

Wow, this place..... what can I even start with?

I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I then read a blurb in Martha Stewart Living (magazine) about it and said: ok, well I just have to try it out.
We went around 6:30 on a Saturday night.
What can I say about my fellow diners.... what a mixed bag. Some people in sneakers and shorts, others in what looks like prom dresses from Forever 21 with enough make up on, if it were to melt with the 100 degree heat outside-you would need floaties to float in it. Diners taking selfies and a million pix of their messy entrees to post on Facebook.
So it's not really clear how to dress or what to expect.

Anyway, we arrived, had to wait, obviously, no reservations taken. The 2 hostesses were actually very friendly. A little tip would be that that front bar IS VERY WARM... the rest of the restaurant was cooler.
We were directed to the back bar to have some drinks while we waited for a table. It was a nice solution.
SO...
The female bartender summed us up real quick, so we got the 'colder shoulder' treatment since it looked like we weren't going to order 10 shots of tequila. Really... after her taking our menu (we were the ONLY people at the bar at that point) while asking 'You don't need this anymore, do you?', there was no way I was going to order anything else from her. Come on people... is it that hard?

We were seated, we had a pleasant waitress. She had a few other tables, 2 that had either 6 or 8 ladies, so that means our 2 top wasn't going to get prompt attention. It is what it is. She was still nice, friendly.

We ordered tacos, and you know what, they were so VERY VERY average. Like REALLY just average. I think I might have had better tacos at EVERY OTHER PLACE I have ever had tacos in my life. I am not joking about this part. I even followed the waitresses recommendations and got 3 different ones, 2 being house specialities. My friend did likewise. She even left half a taco on her plate.

I am just wondering if there is another Barrio Queen people rave about, cause it can't be this place. CAN IT???? Despite the tired decor and so so service, and mixed bag clientele.. you think maybe the food can stand on its own. Well, it can't."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went early on a weekday because we had heard good things and we ended up really liking it. Service was great, we got a table fast, even though it was already pretty busy. We got the street corn and ate them with their yummy homemade chips and got a few tacos (we liked the gringas best) and were completely full by the time we finished.  We will def be back."}
{"text":"A few different things about this place, the location and atmosphere are great! The patio area is very spacious and great for a birthday dinner or date night. However, the only downside is this place gets VERY busy and they don't take reservations so the wait is veryyyy long. The service has been decent both times It's  been, great when it was just two people but not so great with a little larger crowd. The food is really good and easy to share a plate, and a wide variety of traditional Mexican food and one of the best skinny margaritas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"BLECH!! I grew up and lived on the border most of my life and love Mexican food! I recently moved here from Austin and wanted to try a \"Chuys\" clone. Barrio Queen ISNT. 

 First appetizer was the corn. OMG how horrible! Corn with bottled Tampico sauce splashed all over it with a tiny bit of cojita cheese. No crema, no mayo just Tampico.

 Then the bus boy called someone that worked their a fucking white guy in Spanish. That was interesting.... 

And the food came. BLECH again! My husband ordered the enchiladas with mole... By far the worst mole I have ever had!  So sweet and the chili they used was OLD old old. It was like they squeezed Hersheys syrup and added very old chili. OMG it was absolutely the worst. 
Now for my dish. Steak tampicoquena (Tampico), a piece of over cooked fajita meat with green chili on top for $23 no mennito cheese and over cooked crappy meat. The trendy black beans were chalky..They rice dry as hell with no corn, peas or anything.

OH forgot the salsa! I have never had such a bland lifeless salsa since I tried a Mexican place in Ohio! But that was OHIO. Not a short drive to the border with a robust Hispanic population.
 
I won't be back but I will be happy to teach your \"chef\" how to create wonderful real mexican food. My first would be the menudo! Gotta give them kudos it didn't taste like 'caca' but it had a strange sweetness that was repulsive and they used canned posole.
All at a Premium price.


If you want good Mexican food don't go here. Or go to any tiny place that actually cares about their food.
 My offered to teach your chef stands.


EDIT response to owner: I did say something to the server as we where leaving and I even spoke to the other bus person (in Spanish) and he knew I understood everything that was said. 

I did not want anything as per a discount so we just informed our waitress and left.. We were checking out the place for a group of people coming in town next week and sorry I will not be back.
 As for real a Mexican soul food may I suggest you taste your food. Or go learn from your abuela. Even your salsa is a disgrace.

I would also instruct your staff to watch their mouths someone might know what pinche guedo means..

Edit: Now  I am getting harrassed by a user named Don P. via yelp about this review.. Wow Just Wow!"}
{"text":"I wish we had this restaurants in orange county. Just the name alone makes you want to try.
Tried carnitas con Chile. ..awesome tender and juicy.
Elote en vaso...sweet and delish!!last but not least tacos de tinga...spicy and yummy in my tummy. ( a la Yo gabba gabba)

They have a great happy hour and good kids menu.

Please come and show orange county what good authentic home made Mexican food is really like!! 
You guys would definitely give Javiers a run for their money.

Another thing I love..they play actual Mexican music..banda the whole time...not salsa?? Like why salsa music at Mexican joints..it's beyond me?? 

Definitely will come back when inn scottsdale.

Happy tummy...happy hubby..happy toddler ;)"}
{"text":"Came in for margarita Monday's & it was also happy hour. I ordered the tamarind margarita it was \"ok\" table side guac was good but for the price it's a very small portion. The chips n salsa was weak I've had much better tasting salsa. It's pretty bland & watered down for my taste. Wong be back. Oh & the server forgot to discount our margaritas  after introducing margarita Monday to us but we told her & she adjusted it. First & last!"}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try the Barrio Queen when it opened, as we are huge fans of The Barrio. However, the mixed reviews kept us away for awhile. I'm happy to say that whatever they did to make changes now works. The menu is strategically different than The Barrio, and that works, too. My peach margarita was delicious, and my tacos al pastor were the best I have had. (I do understand that for some people, the portions may not be filling......so order a side dish or start with an appetizer.) No problemo. 
Everyone at our table was very happy with their dinners and we are looking forward to sitting on their sidewalk/patio when the heat subsides. I'm also hoping they will have some of the same musicians that perform at the Barrio."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner on the beautiful patio. The menu is unique with great descriptions of a wide variety of amazing dishes. Definitely not the usual fare at most Mexican restaurants!

Started with a virgin margarita, which was delicious! Most places don't put much effort into a cocktail sans alcohol, so THANK YOU for that!

Food was fast, hot and delicious!! Would give a fifth star if the staff were as friendly as they are efficient. BOTH are equally important in every service industry, and it's really nothing more than making eye contact and asking how people are doing...just a few seconds to give the impression that you're glad to be a part of their pleasant dining experience!

Will definitely return to try more of the interesting menu items and will be sure to be extra hungry next time as portion size is huge!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. I had been here before and liked it.  This time not at all.  

Between us we ordered  a variety of tacos; Carne asada, suadero atzeca (brisket), carnitas,  pork chile verde y rayjas,.

I could not taste the difference between the carne asada and the brisket. The pork taco was more fat then meat. Terrible to bite into something and feel a gelatinous mass suddenly in your mouth. 

To top it off the brisket taco was so soggy that when I picked it up liquid literally poured out of it onto the plate. The pork taco was also soggy.  

The soggy issue occurred on both plates"}
{"text":"First off the staff was wonderful so we had a good experience with that. I wish I could remember the name of our server but she was attentive and I ended up giving her a 100% tip because my food order was wrong, it obviously wasn't her fault but she got it fixed and fast without excuse. I'm not one to turn away food but when I order a bean and cheese burrito I expect there to be cheese. Haha that being said why I am giving the restaurant a 3 star is because i don't know how you can say your a Mexican restaurant but don't have refried beans. My burrito had black beans and cheese and in all fairness she did say it was black beans but I thought I'd give it a try. It was not good, you just can't have a bean and cheese burrito with black beans I mean maybe if it was mixed with other beans too? I don't know. Also how is it that there is not a spicy hot salsa! We asked for a spicier hot salsa than what was given and it was weird, not only was it not hot and spicy at all but it also had a weird fruity flavor. We were excited to test out the new restaurant but it didn't hold up to our standards of what Mexican food should be, but it had a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Came here last time we visited and couldn't wait to come back.  Food is amazing!  We ordered a shredded pork appetizer topped with cheese in a chili verde sauce.  Loved it as well as the guacamole they make at your table.  You could make a meal out of a few appetizers however then menu draws you in and everything was great.  We came with friends we ordered several tacos a chili replenish and they're authentic dishes as well.  We enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the other reviews on here and avoided the tacos. For $10 they are some of the smallest tacos around. Got the 3 taco plate and a side of rice. The carne asada and pork taco were ok, the chicken one was sub-par. The rice didn't seem like mexican rice, was very bland and didn't really taste like anything, I don't think I had more than 2 bites of it. They were out of about half of the beers on draft, which was disappointing and the service was about average. Others in our party got burritos and they were enormous for $11. I don't think I'll be back but if you do happen to find yourself here do yourself a favor and get a carne asada burrito and avoid the tacos!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Barrio Queen. The guacamole, as everyone says, is to-die-for. And the chips it's served with are excellent as well. I had a hard time deciding what to get after that because everything looked good, but I went with a chicken quesadilla, which was good but I wasn't terribly fond of the chicken. My husband had their famous pork dish where you make your own pork tacos. He wasn't a fan of the chipotle mashed potatoes that came with it but I really liked them. I would sum up both the food and the decor this way: it's called \"Barrio\" for a reason - it has a local, authentic neighborhood feel. Everything is colorful and unique.
I knocked off a star for the service. We came around 4:30pm, well before the dinner rush. It turns out that their service majorly lacks at this time of day - after we were seated it was several minutes before our drink order was asked, and we had to flag our waitress down to order after that. Also, we ordered the large size of guacamole, which on the menu is said to be \"made table-side\". Ours came pre-mixed with toppings already on it, so I just assumed that table-side service was not actually something that they did.  Well, turns out that once the restaurant became more full, they were mixing table-side guacamoles all over the place. I felt a little cheated out of the experience. This disappointed me but I would definitely come back here and try again."}
{"text":"Just leaving, and we had a group of 7, our server Alicia did so well! For a Sunday night we didn't think there would be a wait. We had to wait about 25 minuets. Not too bad. We sat down with water and chips already on the table. The food was amazing and all of us were so happy. A few in our party got margaritas and they loved them! All of the food is to die for. Definitely try the guacamole!!! Most definitely if you go ask for Alicia!!! She was so nice, helpful and always wanting to make sure we were happy! A job well done!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Guacamole is fresh and not bland love the salsa and skinny cholla margaritas! yum"}
{"text":"Hour wait for a table. Table was filthy,..had to bus it ourselves w/ wet napkins,..food didn't take too long,...server was good,..super nice. Posole had small dried up pc's of Pork w/soggy vegetables. Its a Mexican Restaraunt disguised as \"authentic\" to people who don't know any better. They see the Dia de Los Muertos art & \"think\" its REAL Mexican. Go up the street to Lulu's Tacos if you want REAL Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Delish! In town from California and came here based on reviews and hotel recommendation. The food was delish, the tacos are indeed very small, order at least 4. I would come back."}
{"text":"First off, the food is overpriced for how mediocre it is. second, our waitress decided to tip herself more than she deserved being charged more than I authorized on my debit card and now going through the dispute process with my bank. Worst experience with this restaurant or any by far, definitely never going back. Make sure you pay cash or keep your receipt!"}
{"text":"The food was marvelous! Service was great! Fresh guacamole. Great margaritas. Wonderful selection of tequilas. I would go again anytime! One more thing I really enjoyed was the coffee. It is always done in the French Press. Really good!"}
{"text":"Taco-bout a hidden gem! My office set up a happy hour for the visiting Bostonians. You can expect that they have high standards for good Mexican food when they travel out here. They weren't dissapointed. 

The casa margaritas are out of this world! The picante casa margarita is a bit odd for my taste but if you like cucumbery spicy drinks go for it! I'm more of a sweet and spicy marg girl. 

I had the veggie tacos and a side of sour cream and rice. Amazing! It's very rare I can go to a Mexican food restaurant and have a quality vegetarian meal but this place kicked it out of the park. They even have symbols next to the veggie items on the menu. 

A word of advice: get the guac. It's award winning...rightly so."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and drinks. Our server last night was great throughout the night as we celebrated a birthday. Attentive and made sure we had a fantastic time. Three of us ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo...perfectly sautéed mixed veggies with flavorful shrimp. Not to mention the delicious \"Skinny Chola\" drinks. I definitely recommend this place for awesome food, drinks and a great time."}
{"text":"After a less than stellar take out order, I was invited back by management. Thank you for that; glad I was. The two take out entrees of Camarones al Mojo de Ajo and the Cóctel de Elote were seasoned perfectly and were brought from the kitchen upon arrival for the to-go order rather than from behind the hostess area as it had been the last time. Flavors of lime, cumin and, of course garlic, blend together for just the right amount incredible flavor. Amazing food and just as amazing is their customer service. That was much appreciated, Julio and Katie."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen was a huge disappointment. DO NOT get the tacos. They were so small the table laughed when they brought it - we thought it was a joke, looked smaller than an appetizer. They had numerous items on the menu that were not available and the waiter was pretty rude. With all the good restaurants in the area, dont waste your time or money at Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great service and tasty vegetarian tacos! I ordered all three of their vegetarian taco options. They were all very tasteful. The chili pepper taco was pretty spicy. I should have ordered more of the nopal taco with the egg."}
{"text":"We were in AZ for a work trip and this place was recommended by the hotel and a coworker that had been there before. It took them a while to seat us, it was before the rush hour for dinner and we were a party of 10. We just really wanted the margaritas! Anyways, finally got seated. We ordered margaritas, which were sub par and table side guac. The guac was chunky and had pomegranate seeds in it. It was good but not my style. We ended up staying for dinner and the tacos were really good! I had the healthier trip from the back of the menu. 
I would recommend if you want your taco fix 3 for $10."}
{"text":"Slowest service I have had in a long time. $16 for a margarita. $9 for a small dish of quad that they didn't make at our table even though it is advertised as \"table side quac\" No birthday dessert offered. The food is good, but I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in on impulse. Mainly because we'd been wanting to go for some time and just never got around to it. 

It was a regular Saturday night, semi-busy. The hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait, but really it was only about 5. 

After we got seated is when everything went downhill. It took about 30 minutes for a server to come greet us or offer us water, and this only happened because i went back up to the front to inform the hostess we'd been waiting for that long. 

Someone promptly came by our table with no reasoning or apology for the long wait. We ordered some drinks and an appetizer to start. The drinks came quick but the appetizer did take close to another 30 minutes to come out. Another waiter came by to provide us water refills and to let us know the kitchen was backed-up, which explained the wait. 

When we finally got our food it was actually really delicious. We ordered the Papas Locas with roasted corn off the appetizers. I wish it had fresh salsa rather than the Tapatio they were smothered in, but I'm not going to make a huge deal about that since i do like Tapatio. 

We decided to skip out on ordering entrees because we honestly just didn't want to wait another 30-40 minutes for food. 

I will add that even though we received terrible service, all other tables around us seemed to be attended to well. Not sure why the difference in attention with us versus others. Maybe because all other tables were in large groups and it was only two of us. This still doesn't justify the lack of customer attention. 

Probably won't be going back anytime soon. At least not on a solo date with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"$10.75 for table side guacamole that is only two tablespoons full. Our bowl looked like it had already been eaten and was bland with no flavor. Missing the lime and the spice! They also pick the smallest avocados to use. Our waiter was terrible and could care less, you would think he wasn't working on tips!!!!

Attention barrio queen, increase the portion size of the guacamole or get smaller bowls so it doesn't look so terrible!"}
{"text":"This is some kick ass Mexican food done right. Visiting from California, we heard that this was a great new place. We were not disappointed. Everything we ordered was fantastic. We ordered one of each taco... each done a different way. My favorite was the chicken with pinon cream. The corn appetizer and guacamole are MUST order items. The Pozole Verde...Wow! Better than mine and mine is good! I have to say coming from SF Bay Area, the price for drinks was nuts. Fifteen plus for a Margerita????
I did notice that the website reflects much more reasonable drink prices now though. Having said that, this place is very unique and cool. I loved the Low Rider/ Day of the dead motif. Must stop place for Mexican food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I gave this place two more shots. Both times I was utterly disappointed. 

The service just keeps getting worse and worse. How?? Does Barrio Queen make it a point to find rude, antisocial hosts and waitstaff? 

My second trip back, I met up with a friend on a weekend night. The rush had mostly passed, yet it took a while to be seated. Then, once seated, we waited almost 20 minutes for a waiter to come by our table. We sat outside in the heat without water while several people walked by. When we finally got a waiter, the service was alright--not enough to burn me.

My third trip back, now officially my last, was one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant. It was a weekday night, and I was grabbing dinner with a friend after work. Understandably, Heritage District is busy at dinnertime almost every day. However, Barrio Queen for some reason appeared to be understaffed. The hostesses were telling customers that it would be an hour wait for an inside table, yet half the restaurant was empty. I opted to sit outside again and was told it would be a 5 minute wait. 20 minutes later, my friend and I were still standing in the cramped waiting area. I approach the hostess desk. One woman is standing there looking down cleaning menus. She looks up at me, then decides not to acknowledge me. I say \"excuse me\" and \"hello\" multiple times, yet she continues to clean menus. The second hostess approaches and I ask her how much longer the wait will be since we were told only 5 minutes almost 30 minutes ago. She immediately gets an attitude with me and argues that I should expect to wait a long time because its dinner rush? Really? No apology for giving me an inaccurate wait time? I was blown away. She continued to berate me and insinuate that I lying about being told 5 minutes for the wait. I'm not one to get super angry, but I had to turn around and leave because she was so incredibly rude to me.

The best part is that I called and asked to speak to a manager. I had no intention of ever returning, but I wanted to let him know that his host staff were providing a bad customer service experience. Well, I explained my side of the story to him and he was very indifferent about it. It sounded like he was giggling! He told me there must have been a \"miscommunication.\" He offered up a half-assed, insincere apology, so I just hung up. It actually shocks me how hard this place goes out of their way to be the absolute worst to their customers.

TLDR: Barrio Queen's goal is to provide the worst possible customer service in the industry. Not even their delicious margaritas are incentive to return to this hellhole of a place."}
{"text":"BEST TACO EVER!  - Barrio Pollo & Chorizo -   I wanted to try a few tacos and get a variety, and this one was far better than the rest!  Don't bother with the other interesting ingredients and titles.  So straight to the bold party on your palate.    

Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really was the best taco I have ever had.    Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really great!   The other tacos had interesting titles, but seemed bland & boring.....Ehhh? 

That why this is a 4 star review.

Barrios also has 3 jars of tequila, mescal & jamaica which they keep displayed.  We tried the tequila and mescal and they were wonderful!  The Tequila & Mescal were unusual & good.  They liquors are hard liquor, so be ready for a strong drink which one should sip and savor.  NOT flavored but infused with the actual peppers.  The pepper Tequila was quite hot.  If you like spicy, this is perfect for sipping on a cold night.  It warms you from within. 

I am no connoisseur.  I just like bold in your face flavors.  Barrios has bold flavors if you stick with these recommendations."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting here yesterday and really enjoyed it! I love the colorful ambiance and the location is prime, right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. The service was friendly and attentive from start to finish which is always a plus when in Old Town! 

When coming to Barrio Queen, ordering their guac is a MUST! They make it right there in front of you and the secret ingredient is pomegranate seeds! It is so tasty! Everything that they put in it is fresh and it shows. I also love their salsa that comes complimentary as you sit down. For lunch I ordered their Mexican Caesar Salad {it had a fancier name} with chicken and really enjoyed it. The dressing was delicious and had a great tang. The chicken was also seasoned to perfection. However, I found it a little weird that the bottom layer of the salad was a GIANT piece of lettuce. It was super hard to eat because you had to cut it up into smaller pieces. I would prefer the whole salad to be chopped up. The highlight of the lunch was their Paloma!! OH MY GOSH - it was made with fresh grapefruit juice and oh so tasty! I would absolutely order it time and time again. 

Anywho, we had a great experience and due to the size and location, it makes a great place for groups!"}
{"text":"Eeeek....where do I begin.  I really wanted to like this place because the patio was beautiful and the decor looked lovely.  However, it appears that is ALL this company spent time on.  The staff literally acted like they didn't really enjoy their job, it was just mandatory they participate.  It took our waiter 10 minutes to get to our table after being sat, and he actually had the guts to say \"I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention and didn't see you.\" Mmm...okay?  He was nice, so it was whatever. But within the first 15 minutes of being there, 3 servers dropped entire trays full of food and our waiter dropped a bowl of limes in my boyfriend's lap. All were accidents, but it made the whole place feel very lacking in training.  

We ordered our drinks and some table side guacamole, because it stated \"Award Winning\" on the menu. Plus, I love me some guac. Well, it was less than sub-par.  He just cut up some avocado, smashed it just a tad, threw some other ingredients into a bowl, mixed it, and presented it. No spices, no seasoning, not even mushed. I REMIXED it myself, added some salt and pepper, a little salsa (which was also not great), and mushed it more. It was a little better. 

Then, came dinner. I ordered 3 different kinds of tacos and the boyfriend ordered carne asada enchiladas. Big disappointment in both. I had 1 shrimp, 1 fish, and 1 carne asada taco, all again, less than sub-par.  The carne asada tasted like they put absolutely no seasoning, not even salt, on it when they cooked it and all the meats were cold.  My shrimp was extremely overcooked and my fish was tasteless. I didn't even finish it. The enchiladas my boyfriend ordered were actually awful. The food itself was beyond bland, but the sauce was the worst. It tasted almost burnt like, which was bizarre to me. Again, no seasoning on his carne asada. 

I really think this place could be great if a major overhaul of either staff and cooks, or training is done. Won't be returning for any reason unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends and large groups! The Guacamole is a must and a must see ~ Nationally Renowned and prepared at table side. From Spicy Shrimp to Street Tacos to my personal favourite ~ Cochinita Pibil (pork tortas) with a smear of beans. Margueritas are tasty too!!! Always busy here, do call ahead."}
{"text":"Tacos on taco Tuesday are amazing and I mean AMAZING.  Drink prices are reasonable. Sorry I cannot vouch for anything g besides that but definitely give my experience 5 stars.  Love the patio."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is one of best Mexican food restaurants I had the pleasure of eating in Phoenix. 
The location in Scottsdale lends for good people watching with any patio table. Friday night is really busy for restaurant with 30-45 minute wait for any table in restaurant. The hostess is standing right outside the front door to take your name/number at which they will text you once your table is ready. Once we sat at our table the waiter brought chips and salsa(hot), the chips are fresh! I ordered Chicken Suzia without chorizo. I must say the jalapeño sauce on top of the enchiladas was AMAZING! My friend ordered the Chicken mole enchiladas and she raved about the mole sauce. 
It's safe to say I will be back at Barrio Queen maybe for less crowded night."}
{"text":"Slow service, when our food came out it looked like it's been sitting for a bit. Our server complained about the kitchen and overly apologized for our \"expectations\" not being met for a \"place like this.\" We weren't super clear what he meant.. my order was wrong but the guac was good. We won't go back"}
{"text":"*update below*

literally right under my office building! so glad something finally opened up in this space.

today i had the flank steak with grilled veggies. it was ok! i thought the price was just a wee bit high so i probably won't be ordering it again but i will be coming back to try other things. most of the items on the menu were fairly priced.

our waitress, yvette, was the best! our drinks were always filled. she was hilarious and did a great job answering our questions and making special requests. one of the best waitresses i've had. 

*update*
we called to-go today. the girl taking our order wasn't familiar with the menu. we ordered a few tacos and after each taco she'd be like 'is that one of our tacos?' then we ordered the green chile pork. she said they didn't have that. we told her it's on the menu and she asked where so we told her. 

i get they're still new so i'm not super annoyed. the part that bugged me after all that was that my food had hair in it. there's nothing worse than taking a bite and having to pull a long hair out of your mouth. 

probably won't be coming back for a few months. i'll let them get settled and learn the menu and figure things out."}
{"text":"Happy hour margaritas are the best in town.  Arizona but tito is great as well with just the right amount of heat to the green Chile pork."}
{"text":"At first my thoughts were \"really? Another Mexican restaurant in downtown Gilbert??\" But, this one is completely different than the others! I love the atmosphere!  Happy hour prices are great. We had the carnitas with green chile appetizer and it was amazing. My husband had some kind of brisket burrito which was huge and very tasty. I had tacos - they were just ok. I don't like that you have to ask for chips and salsa. Regular menu prices are a bit high I think."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a quick shopping day in Old Town.  This place is at the very back of Old Town near I believe Fashion Square.  The last time I was in this area was 2004 and it was certainly not this large. Fashion Square did not exist so my apologies if my directions are off a bit.  Anyway, this place was great!  Food was perfect size for lunch, I had 3 for $10 tacos which are street tacos with your choice of taco. There were about 15 choices to pick from. You can add rice and beans for about $3.00 extra, but I chose not to. Chips are homemade, and the salsa was great! LOVED the salsa! We had seats on the patio because it was a gorgeous day out. They had heaters out there too. Great spot and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Yum yum ..  get the taco's. House made tortillas.. lots of interesting combinations.. good service and pleasant staff. A must do .."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful very reasonably priced staff was phenomenal especially magaley she was personable knowledgeable and outstanding  in guest services"}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had. If your in the Scottsdale area go see Daniel, it's a must stop restaurant. My meal recommendation is the Suiza enchiladas."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Sunday night around 7.  There was a 45 minute wait even for both inside and patio seating even though there were numerous open tables (understaffed??). We waited for a bit in Barnes and Noble and then headed back before they texted us our table was ready. When we got back there was NO ONE waiting outside or in the entrance for a table. We stood there waiting as the hostesses eyed us until one of them asked who our reservation was under. She said she'd seat us immediately since we were physically waiting there... (suspicious?). Our server was quick to take our drink orders and return for our food order. She brought us chips and salsa as well. The chips were amazing!! Thick and crunchy with just the right amount of salt. The salsa, however, was as plain and mild as a can of tomato juice.  Our tacos came out after about 15 minutes. Our waitress was not the one to being them to our table and did not check on how we were doing after our food was brought. If she had we would have been able to tell her that we received a wrong taco but we were hungry and sick of waiting so we ate it anyway. As for the tacos, the carne asada had good flavor though it could use a fresh lime with it. The al pastor was spicy but balanced out with fresh pineapple. The al pastor was our favorite. I also tried the pescado taco. The breading was very bland and it could have used more aioli to give it more flavor. Overall, I was disappointed with this location and it would not be my first choice for tacos."}
{"text":"I ordered the tacos.  Carnitas, Cochinita Pizil, and Cameroon Asado.   All three were juicy and tasty.  The Cochinita was undoubtedly citrus I could definitely appreciate the orange unlike so many of this type where you only taste greasy pork.  My favorite of the three was the Cameroon Asado,  the shrimp is perfect!  well seasoned and so good with a light aioli that is much better than the average mayo or tarter used on seafood tacos.

My husband also ordered tacos but his experience was much different from mine.  He ordered the brisket and two different kinds of carne asada.  All three were extremely dry and tasteless (and compared to mine the amount of filling was stingy besides).

I'll have a really hard time convincing him to go back and try something else.  I'm kindof sad.  I like the atmosphere, the prices are reasonable, the service was polite...but I have to agree, his order was very sub-par.  

The takeaway?  Go for the shredded meat and seafood selections and steer clear of the asada or other items that are easily dried out (even my daughter's chicken fingers off the kids menu was way way over done).  If you choose wisely you'll probably have a good experience."}
{"text":"Ill walk you thru our experience, first the hostess doesn't like her job. we choose to sit outside which was nice. I had looked at the menu at wok and was excited to try their authentic tacos al pastor since they are my favourites. They sucked, it was like eating sweet shredded pork, they had little to no cilantro. The chorizo taco was like puked greasy meat, the carne asada was average, all had stale cold tortillas. The salsa and chips where ok, salsa was not hot as expected but did offer a \" hotter\" salsa. We ordered some rice and beans, beans seem like from a can with bits of queso fresco, rice was on the dry side. Ordered some fish tacos which tasted like dry chicken. The best part was the horchata and our server, \"kay\" he has glasses and slim, about 5'-7\" he's pretty cool. This barrio restaurant is far from barrio and their authentic food is far from authentic. Not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Loved their homemade guacamole and fish tacos! Margaritas were great as well. I also enjoyed dining on their outdoor patio. BQ is a gem."}
{"text":"Dakota is a very competent bartender.He's very engaging, nice young man! Love the carnitas and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Well, this was a tough one to rate star-wise because they're usually so good! My boyfriend and I came in for a late lunch on Sunday the 13th. We got seats right away at the bar. No greet from the hosts. 

The drinks, like usual, are great! The food is usually really great too, especially the chips. The chips we hard and super greasy, like maybe they were fried too long.  My biggest issue is that we said NO CHEESE on all our tacos. My boyfriend has a cheese and yogurt allergy. Sounds weird but it's not dairy, not preference, just those 2 things, something in the cultures. I got mine with no cheese too so we can share. Mine came out with no cheese, but his did. I told our bartender, who was very nice, told a manager and he took them back. Literally, 2 minutes later, they were back out!

We looked closely and there were still cheese particles on it. All they did was pick it off! My boyfriend had already eaten one when they came out thinking it was safe when I noticed the cheese still there. We ended up switching plates completely. So neither of us got to try all of them because he couldn't eat the cheese and I didn't want to take away from what he had. 

The manager, Mike, brought them back. YOU should know better! We reiterated ALLERGY numerous times and it's just upsetting that they don't take that serious. Home now and he has a terrible stomach ache. Also no host said good-bye to us, they were just in their own little world. Customer service needs work!"}
{"text":"The art was the best thing about the restaurant. We had a very accommodating waitress A reasonable wait for the food and apparently a very well respected selection of tequila and some foo foo drinks. The meat in the Chili Nogada (for me) was overcooked and the roasted corn in appetizer menu tried  a little too hard. Not a fan.  

  Bar far  the best thing I tasted was the five dollar happy hour  Chili  Verde absolutely delicious and- and a generous portion,  at that.  All in all  the restaurant seems to b favored  by by lots of nice looking, well scrubbed folks"}
{"text":"I grew up in AZ on Sonoran style mexican food.  Much as I enjoy it, it just ain't health food.  The Barrio has improved on the old standbys. No longer does your food swim in melted cheese.  We had the guacamole made tableside - a little cilantro and dried cranberries make it really special.  They make their own corn tortillas which make great chips.  We shared a plate of cheese enchiladas.  The side veggies were done perfectly - cooked but crisp.  the black beans had just enough sauce.  But the best was that enchilada sauce, which they also make themselves.  A smoky flavor - probably chipotle chilis? At any rate, loved the food.  Service was not fussy (Sunday noon in the summer) but good.  had  a nice glass of chilled white to go with our food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"\"No way, Josè!\" That's what I said when I went to Barrio Queen for my birthday dinner and had Josè as our server who serenaded me with mariachi-style songs while I enjoyed the amazing food! So, yes way! 

My best friend in the whole world made a reservation for my birthday dinner and since we all love Mexican food (olè!), we decided to dine at Barrio Queen. Upon arrival, the place was crowded and had a great ambiance, and even had live music on the patio. We were seated inside at a cute and comfy booth (although I would've loved to enjoy the live music outside... another time).

Josè, our server was absolutely phenomenal! He really added to the whole experience and made it extra... because, let's face it, it was my birthday so it was kind of \"extra\". Josè was attentive, anticipated our needs without us having to ask, quick, and he made us all laugh the whole night.

For dinner, we had a plethora of food (see what I did there? 3 Amigos reference, hehe): 
* Chips & Salsa: complimentary and made with love... you can taste the love with every bite you take. 
* Barrio Guacamole: delicious guac prepared table-side. Yeaaaa, we devoured it. 
* Carne Asada Burrito: Grilled mouth-watering steak marinated in fresh orange and garlic, epazote black beans, Oaxaca cheese, homemade pico de gallo and avocado. Then it's topped with sour cream and fresh cilantro, and extra pico de gallo on the side... it's HUGE!!! 
* The Queen -- this is what I ordered, since I was the Birthday Queen and all, lol: Enchiladas with a blend of yummy cheeses, including Oaxaca, cotija and goat cheese; mixed with sautéed spinach, shallots and garlic and then topped with a spicy cream sauce (drool), more cotija cheese and fresh sour cream. (Reliving eating this and my mouth is watering).
* Chiles en Nogada: Authentic Mexican dish, super yum! Roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, apples, pears, dried apricots, golden raisins, walnuts, onions and garlic (sounds weird, but it's mouth-wateringly delicious!) Then it's topped with an almond cream sauce, and the Mexican flag: made of fresh cilantro, queso fresco, almond slices and pomegranate seeds. And, as if that wasn't enough, it comes with chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies. 
* Azteca Enchiladas: Delicately slow-cooked melt-in-your-mouth beef brisket and melted Oaxaca cheese, and topped with green tomatillo sauce, diced red onions, fresh cilantro and fresh sour cream. 

It was so much food, that we all ended up getting to-go boxes (yay for amazing leftovers!), so come super hungry and be prepared to be really full when you leave. 

For dessert, we were so full that we didn't order any... but I must say, I was a bit bummed out that Barrio Queen doesn't do a free dessert for birthdays. Josè, seeing that I was bummed out, went out of his way and brought me a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a candle in it, which made my night... plus, he serenaded me while he brought it. It's the simple things in life that make me smile, and quite honestly, the fact that Josè did that for me was so heartfelt and extremely appreciated. (Maybe, perhaps, Barrio Queen, you do little things for birthdays... just a suggestion... it doesn't take much to make people smile).

Anywho, my friends have been bugging me to go back to Barrio Queen, and honestly, I'm trying to free up my schedule to go back again ASAP (but only when Josè is working, lol). Thanks for a great birthday experience!!!"}
{"text":"Good Margaritas the guacamole is so yummy.  One of the best in town."}
{"text":"Really interesting place. Packed. Definitely figure out a way to avoid crowds if you can. 

The food: we had the table side guacamole and chips and salsa and queso fundito. We also had their version of the skinny girl Margarita-which was delicious. Not too much salt.

Dinner was kind of a mixed bag-I had the chicken mole which was served cold - I think it was supposed to be warm. Overall the flavors were good and I enjoyed the little tortillas that came with the meal. 

Fish tacos were a little fishy. 

The rest of our party generally seemed to be enjoying their dinner. 

This place is a little over hyped but it is solid and I wouldn't wait in line for it."}
{"text":"Wonderful margaritas and tacos. My favorite were: Al Pastor, Chicken w/ chorizo, and shrimp. Definitely going to be coming back! Glad Desert Ridge finally has something exciting besides Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and thought the food was excellent! I work in the area and have wanted to stop in for a while. I got 3 tacos one was the barrio pollo, a fish taco, and a chile taco and all were excellent. Got the churros for dessert and was very impressed on how good they were. The atmosphere is great and all the employees were very friendly. I will definitely be back to order some different items from the menu."}
{"text":"I had had family come from out of the country and was looking for a really good place to take my family out for dinner. My coworker highly recommended I go try your place. So we did and it was my first time in. I got to say I was a little disappointed in how the service was and most of all our server. He didn't get a our order right we asked him stuff from the menu seem to not really know how the food is cooked and the worst thing he did was right when we got our food he gave us our check and my husband really upset told him no we will be still be consuming it was an embarrassment to my family because we had told them we had heard really good stuff about the place and come to see it was not that all great . The only good part was the food was good wish our service would've been that good to and it's a shame cause we didn't really enjoy after that whole situation and feeling like our server was in such a hurry for us to leave."}
{"text":"Love Mexican food but I got their take on the hamburger. Beef and chorizo peppers and cheese and seasoned fries and brioche bun (I think). It was really one of the best burger fries meals I've had   Fun interior and nice staff   We really enjoyed"}
{"text":"We have been to Barrio Queen several times and are never disappointed. The restaurant is lovely, the staff is outstanding and the food was amazing. The pork carnitas are the best we have ever had. Our last visit was a party of 11 and everyone was pleased with their meal. We sat on the comfortable patio and loved watching people walk by while we enjoyed dinner and drinks. I think it is one of the top patios in town."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some margaritas post-dinner and we got great service from Tara! Bubbly personality and she made our experience awesome!"}
{"text":"Just returned from a very expensive, not so good lunch. As many have pointed out, the service is just horrible. After sitting for 10 to 15 minutes, we flagged someone down and asked what was up. Shortly after a person shows up and says, \"do you know what you want?\". He seemed a bit annoyed when I said we wanted something from the bar before ordering. Finally ordered and received food. The food was nothing special. Not great, not bad.

Also the cloth napkins are overdue to be replaced. They are raggedy and a little gross. For a locally owned restaurant, it is especially disappointing to see little care from the staff. There was a manager present. Male in his late 30s to early 40s. He made occasional appearances in the dining room, but mainly seemed to be chumming it up with a few select workers instead of seeing that his dining room was running smoothly. 2 other tables had to get up and ask the hostess for a check while we were there. There were only 8 tables, so not like they were busy. Wanted to really like this place. But they just don't seem to be that interested in doing a good job"}
{"text":"We had a great time at lunch yesterday.  We decided to sit inside because it was a little warm outside.  It was a good decision and we noticed others moved inside also.  We started out with the 'made in front of you' guacamole.  Very good and the pomegranate seeds made it.  The chips were very crunchy and made in half moon forms for scooping.  I had a beer and it was ice cold served in an ice cold mug.  We each had a variety of the taco options and all of them were good.  These tortillas were about the size of the cardboard coaster my beer was sitting on and were filled with great ingredients, served hot and full of flavor.  I would recommend lunch or dinner here any time.  Next time I will dive into a margarita or one of the 500+ tequila options available at the bar."}
{"text":"We were there sunday afternoon ! We were told 45 min wait by smiling hostess went to the bar got some delicious and unique drinks, 15 min latter we got our table, our waitress Tori was so friendly we order the queso fundido it was the best we ever tryed, I order the special for mothers day OUTSTANDING, delicious, perfect, no words for this, my husband ordered the pescado veracruzano dish really good entree also everything was awesome the manager that stopped at our table she is so friendly and professional forgot her name but I think she is Mexican she gave us a menu tour, thank you Barrio Queen for this gift for Gilbert."}
{"text":"Thank you for coming to Desert Ridge !! You are amazing, grear staff, food is extremely delicious !!!!!!!! Managers wooww, always on top of great service. Mole enchiladas to die for !

This is my 4th time in this restaurant I really enjoyed everything, food, service, ambience, if you really want to enjoy your night out,  go to Barrio Queen, you wont regret."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Mexican Restaurant, really authentic food, fresh flavors I tryed a salad from summer menu perfect for our hot weather, my friend ordered the cold torta great choice as well, we were there monday when they just open a hispanic blond lady went thru the menu and did an excellent job, it was our first time we will be definitely back soon."}
{"text":"This place has good food but their staff is SUPER slow! We waited for a table and saw two empty but they didn't sit us. And the hostess just kept walking around."}
{"text":"So after reading reviews on Yelp my girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant. Biggest mistake since Russia sold Alaska to the US. We arrived and immediately felt we were greeted hostilely. The lady at the front did not seem to like her job. We were seated outside and brought chips. The chips were soggy, thick, and complete trash. Don't even get me started about the salsa! The heck was that?! The salsa had little to no flavoring or texture. If you told me it was water with red food coloring, I'd believe you! Now, onto the tragedy that was the food.  I got a burrito while my homie got some vegetarian ish. Both were complete DISASTERS. The meat was similar to a marshmallow, not the kind you find in s'mores. It was hard and elastic. Moving onto the vegetarian meal. What the heck was that?! Took one bite and spit that ish out! Disgusting! Luckily, we had a QUEEN for a waitress I believe her name was Christine or something along those lines. She took the food back and took it off our bill. A beautiful soul. 


Overall, I would definitely rate this restaurant 5 stars. I would recommend to Hitler."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Friday night with my girlfriends. Love the decor and the feel of the place. We started out with margaritas which I enjoyed. It was super strong and had too much tequila in it, but I wasn't going to complain!

We started out with one of their specials, barrio papas. It was basically French fries with corn and cheese. I wasn't too impressed and wished I ordered the elote instead. I was surprised this was their \"especial de la casa\". We also got free chips and salsa. Salsa wasn't anything special.

What I did enjoy was the tacos. I had the Cochinita Pibil which was delicious. The pork with the pickled sour orange, pico de gallo and oranges hit the spot for me. The carnitas weren't bad either. I was told they are marinated in coke! 

I wasn't particularly wowed by the restaurant as a whole, hence the 3 stars. However, I'd love to come back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"Just OKAY!
Had tacos, burritos, a sangria and chips and salsa...there was nothing too special about the food and I don't plan on returning....oh and service was just OKAY as well... I'm only giving 2 stars for the enviorment and the al pastor tacos being decent."}
{"text":"New menu items, updated decor. The cheeses enchiladas were delicious. Unfortunately, the Caesar salad has a strong chipotle flavor we didn't prefer. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places for tacos in the valley. We love bringing all our out of town friends and family here. Would give it 5 stars, but the staff can be a bit unfriendly at times - the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"They Forgot Us, But Sherrie Changed the Experience and My Opinion

So today was pretty epic.  My boyfriend's favorite former co-worker, Aaron,  was joining us, and another friend for lunch/dinner.  Aaron was in Phoenix for the weekend from California.  I had been hearing great stories about this work friend for over 3 years, so I was super excited to finally meet him.   We live a few blocks from Gilbert Rd and decided upon tacos.  None of us had ever been to Barrio Queen, so it was an easy choice.  I had been wanting to check the place out for a while.

It was 3:30pm on a Saturday, and we put in our name for a 4-top.    I was surprised that we were told that there would still be a 15 minute wait.  I was also impressed that they were that busy at such a weird time. It was early for dinner and late for lunch.   Other restaurants we had walked past were nearly empty.   

We had a seat on a bench at the entrance and had a nice visit.  Soon, however, we noticed other people who had put their names in after us were being seated, and others didn't seem to put in a name at all - they were just shown to a table immediately.  It had been over 30+ minutes, and we had to flag someone down to ask why (we even asked for outdoor seating and the patio was basically empty).  The girls in the front checked the list, and spoke among themselves - they did not give us an apology or even explain why we were left sitting and waiting while others came in and got seated immediately.  We were shown to a table, as if they meant to leave us sitting there all along.   They said absolutely nothing.   OK........whatever.   Meanwhile I'm thinking that maybe they think they are too cool or trendy that they don't have to apologize..............which is OK, but we won't ever come back.  There are 3 other places within walking distance that also have Mexican food.

We ordered some guacamole and margaritas, and Sherrie, our server was amazing and hilarious.   Almost immediately after we ordered drinks, Frank, our other friend accidentally knocked his appetizer plate with his menu onto the patio.  It smashed and was loud.   I didn't even realize that it was our table at first.   If you knew Frank, you'd realize how funny this is.   We can't take that guy anywhere!   Sherrie picked up on this and started telling us that Barrio Queen was not a Greek Restaurant and we can't just smash the plates.   It was hilarious, and I loved her immediately.   Then she made us this amazing guacamole table-side and helped me to poke fun at Frank's inability to pronounce anything Spanish.

We all decided to have the 3 for $10 tacos, with sides of rice and beans.  I was particularly interested in the Nopalito taco, because I have wanted to cook those at home, but have never actually had them anywhere to compare the flavor.  Everything was very good, and the margaritas were perfect.   Sherrie continued to be charming and hilarious.

So, upon visiting Barrio Queen I was initially expecting to be disappointed, but now I'll definitely be back and I hope Sherrie will be working because she was just fantastic and changed my first impression."}
{"text":"The best enchiladas I've had in a really long time! 
Me and my friends went here on a friends referral and very much enjoyed the food and ambiance. It's located in a square setting in downtown Scottsdale, so we sat outside enjoying the evening scene. 

I ordered the carne asada enchiladas and I'm not kidding when I say they were the best enchiladas I've had. I was a little worried with the red sauce, as I'm usually not a fan of red sauce. Totally blew me away. I need to find a way to get these in Vegas. My friends ordered the carne asada burrito and a variety of tacos; needless to say we all walked away completely stuffed. 

My only complaint was the lack of service. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed and not able to service us properly. I never got a second beer and it took a couple asks to get chips and salsa. I hope this isn't common there. 

Will definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is amazing. It makes me sad to only leave 2 stars, but I have to finally call out the front of the house. The service here is absolutely horrific. Every. Single. Time. We go here every time hoping it'll be better because we love the food so much. Last night the service was so bad we almost walked out. I had to stand up and ask for a server after 15 mins of being ignored. Food came to the table cold, wrong appetizer was rung in, had to stand up and get my own drinks from the bar after 5 mins of staring at them, and had to stand up to ask for the check after waiting 15 mins after finishing. The server only had 2 other tables, and they had to do the same. Service is so bad every single time that this HAS to be a problem with the front of the house management. Not once in 10+ visits has the service been even remotely acceptable. Fire some front of the house managers and start over with them Chef Salcido! Your food is too amazing to be blatantly disrespected every single time."}
{"text":"First time at Barrio Queen today. Had lunch with the family. Although they were very busy on a Saturday early-afternoon, we were seated quickly. 

We all ordered the $10 three-taco special. You can mix and match from 18 different tacos. I ordered a carnitas taco, one al pastor and one carne asada con chorizo azul. Between the four of us we ordered 16 tacos (they are traditionally small) and we got 15 different kinds. 

Chips and salsa arrived: both hand made which was a nice touch. The chips were hot, thick and just the right amount of salt. The salsa was thick with a little zip. 

Kinda went downhill a bit here. My wife is allergic to onions but the server said \"no problem.\"  My daughter said she didn't want her tacos garnished with extra cilantro, (just a taste preference) and the boys had no changes. My wife's tacos had onions, my daughter's tacos were buried in cilantro and I received a wrong taco. 

The server did her best to make good on a bad situation.  She quickly brought hot, new tacos and gave us flan for dessert on the house. Nice remedy but I would have rather had it right the first time. 

On to the food:  the carnitas taco was good. Nothing earth shaking but tasty. Very spicy tho. The al pastor: awesome. Tender, sweet, spicy and just the right amount of char on the meat. The carne asada con chorizo azul: epic!  Tender, good char, great seasonings. Bleu cheese on a taco? Genius. I highly recommend the carne asada con chorizo azul. Next time I will probably get two of those and two al pastors and have a siesta later. 

Fix the ADHD issue in the kitchen and, Madre, you'll have a winner."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had to wait 60 minutes on a wed night to get in for dinner, but the service was lovely and the food was well worth it. Queso fundido is a popular appetizer and the tacos were bomb. It's is more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant, but the food is great and the ambiance is fun"}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere. Love the Latin music and unique menu. Tried the carnitas verde appetizer and guacamole, both were very flavorful and the chips were fresh and thick. Jalapeño margarita was so good they make their own jalapeño tequila. 
Tip ask for the hot salsa if you like spice and flavor. It was so good. The first salsa brought it couldn't touch it. 
Will be back for taco Tuesday. 

We took home menudo. I must say most of the customers who are going to order menudo are going to be Mexican.  It can be an acquired taste. We were disappointed. Very little tripe, not very spicy but did have a cinnamon flavor. It's ok guys ramp up the spice on this one. Just like My abuelita."}
{"text":"I am going to regret saying this but here it goes... $2 TACO TUESDAY + Happy Hour drink prices.  I have been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed by the food... on one occasion i was disappointed by the service (that was when they first opened so willing to give them another try).  I have been here for the Tuesday special twice now and I love it!  Keep up the good work Barrio Queen - i don't want to see yet another restaurant open in that space... you are a perfect fit!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, very atmospheric. What else can I say about this place? I got the Arizona burrito which was pork in a tomatillo sauce topped with Creme Fresca and red onions, and was thinking maybe I'd order a side of rice and beans. Thank goodness I didn't! The thing was massive and filled with pork, no cheap fillers. It was $15 bucks or so and worth every penny. I'm a big eater and had a heck of a time finishing it. Oh, I forgot to add that the basket of chips were big and fried to perfection, and served with a salsa I've never had before. I carefully studied that salsa to see if I could replicate it at home. Definitely had roasted tomatoes and tomatillos. Any way, do yourself a favor and give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Got the barrio pollo burrito. Gross. Nothing but chicken in a thin, tasteless sauce. The chicken didn't seem to be of a good quality. Ate three bites and tossed it."}
{"text":"First time coming to Barrio Queen on Tatum. Definitely will return. The food was great and the service was even better. Sat at the bar and Megan took care of us. She went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed and were happy. Thanks Megan, you're the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great margarita, great salsa, great elotes.  Had the chiles en nogada.  Was so so so good!"}
{"text":"Always busy, which can be a good sign, but enough so that we've been unable to stay bc of long waits.  when you get in it is worth the effort.  in 5-6 visits so far to work my way through taco options, and yet to find one i didnt like.  Pibil and Chicken plates are great if not feeling tacos, and guac is must every time. Chef Sylvania is pretty damn brilliant with the flavor combos here."}
{"text":"This will be a short post. We went there for lunch. It was not busy. We were quickly seated. We sat outside at the table for 10 minutes watch the wait staff pass by but never talking to us. No one spoke to us. No water, nothing. We decided to leave. As we walked out the hostess that seated us 10 minutes earlier thanks us for coming. She did not remember seating us minutes earlier. It all turned out great because the second place we went to turned out to be awesome. I don't know how the food is at BQ but the service is nonexistent."}
{"text":"Love the name, but disappointed in the quality of the food considering this is a Mexican restaurant in the Southwest. I ordered asada tacos and you can tell it was low quality beef used to make them. Our table ordered guacamole, I wasn't impressed by that either and I love Chipotle gauc so that should tell you, I'm far from a gaucamole snob. I did have a margarita and it was tasty but not strong."}
{"text":"It was my 4th visit to Barrio Queen tonight and I am sad to say, my last. As the food is pretty darn good, I wanted to make this place a go to spot, but the service/experience is too much to bare. Out of four trips, only my prior visit was decent. We thought things were on the up swing, but tonight was the nail in the coffin. 

To start, the text reservation system failed and at least one couple who came in after us was seated before. We waited 20 minutes (not bad) but there were a lot of open tables so it was hard to understand why. Anyway, when I went up and asked where were in line, I got an poor excuse that their text system was acting up. Ok, fine, but I literally was 5 feet from the hostess stand the entire time and there were ZERO other people waiting in side. No name call as a back up.  It rubbed me the wrong way that there was no apology, just a bad excuse.

We were seated promptly after questioning our position, but from here, it did not improve. Appetizer came and we had no place setting or napkins, worse, nobody around to ask. Finally grabbed some cocktail napkins from the bar to hold us over.  We had the queso fundido so didn't need the utensils, but it wasn't as hot as it should have been, so we had to spoon it onto the chips with our fingers. Then the entrees came before we done with the app, again, nobody to help the runner with the full table, so we hand to stack stuff up and make room for him to set stuff down. We were pretty much done with our drinks at this point, no refill or chance for one though out the entire entree. Luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes to ask for the check."}
{"text":"Food-- Muy Bueno
Drinks-- perfecto
Prices-- MALO, and that is why I can't give this place any more than 3 stars. On a side note, if you go tot he VFW down the street and get toasty before you go to dinner...it will be worth the risk of needing a tetanus shot"}
{"text":"My tacos didn't have any flavor at all. I was totally disappointed. I can't believe their tacos are the best in The Valley. I have tried to contact them but they have ignored my email and message."}
{"text":"I went to the Gilbert location. The tacos were totally disappointing. No flavor at all. We can cook something way much better at home. I have tried to send emails and messages to the Gilbert location and they have ignored me. Can the Scottsdale location do something about this?"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch recently and we quite enjoyed the atmosphere upon walking in.  We were both pretty famished so we ordered the Carnitas en Chile Verde.  But while it was super tasty it was quite hard to eat with the chips because the carnitas came in huge pieces that hadn't been split or cut up.  Both of us figured if this is an app to be eaten with chips, it should be user friendly...but instead we had to use our forks, cut it up on our plate, and then scoop it up with the chips.  Annoying.

The two of us went for their 3 street taco plates so we could try as many flavors as possible.  I had the carne asada chorizo azul (but was given carne asada...grrrrrrrrr), bario pollo, and pescado.  The bario pollo was my favorite because of the huge poblano pepper at the bottom.  It was quite flavorful while the others were so so.  If you go for the first time, it is totally worth it to try the 3-taco plate and get 3 different types so you can try as much of the flavors as possible...I highly recommend going this route!

Now as for the service, it wasn't so great.  Our waiter was one of the most crankiest and lack luster servers I have ever had.  We even tried joking with him and striking up conversation, but he wasn't having it.  He was also not so good at showing up to refill our water glasses or ask if we needed anything else.  We noticed he was this way with all the tables in our section in front of the bar.  I can't remember his name because I think I tuned it out out of annoyance."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last night (it was a Friday night). We arrived at 8:30pm and were told it was a 20 minute wait for a table. When we were finally seated (around 9pm) about half the restaurant was empty with multiple empty tables, which I thought was a bit strange seeing as they had not only us, but other people waiting. 

We ordered the tableside guacamole which came with cranberries in it, and was lovely. I prefer the guacamole at The Mission though, because they ask you how spicy you like it and it is more tailored to your preferences, at Barrio Queen, they just put everything in and make it in front of you. We both ordered 3 tacos from the menu and the Paloma cocktail. The cocktail was nice, a little syrupy, and too sweet for my taste but overall not bad. The tacos were very small, but nice. I love spicy food, and so does my friend but we were floored on the carne asada y chile taco. I think it burnt about half my tastes buds out of my mouth and was quite unpleasant. The jalepeno in it had been roasted and none of the seeds had been taken out so it was like eating fire. As someone who never has problems with spicy food this was a massive surprise. The one taco that stood out the most and really impressed me was the chicken and chorizo barrio house special taco. It was truly incredible and given half the chance I would eat about 10.

The one thing that put me off the most, was the ambiance. While the location and decor was nice enough, and somewhat what you expect from a Mexican eatery in Arizona, for the price of the meal I thought the decor was a bit down market. This place lacks sophistication, which is reflected in the patrons who get very drunk and loud, while there are crying babies at the next table. So if thats the kind of mood your in, go for it. But the claims that this place is Mexican fine dining is false."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town, Mexican or other.  Interesting location, inside and out, with great artwork adorning the walls. Food is delicious, the menu varied, and the dishes feel more refined and inventive than those usually offered in a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great. Tacos for days with some menu items you won't find everywhere.  Great little atmosphere with excellent outside seating.  This is always a stop to bring friends and family from out of town. Perfect place to hit before a night on the town in Scottsdale. Not the best if you have a large group."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Honestly I didn't care the first time when I ordered something other than the tacos (apparently it was forgettable). 

Today we went in for taco Tuesday's and wow it was a great surprise. I love the variety of tacos they had which I missed the first time around. My favorite was the carne adada with Blue Cheese (something something azul). There was one with pineapple that was good as well! As much as I love a fried egg on my burger it doesn't go so well on a taco. Unfortunately, since I ordered four tacos by the time they arrived and with the variety I can't tell you the other flavors or be more specific with the names. 

You do get free chips and salsa. The chips are a bit plain but are nice and thick with a crunch. The plainness isn't something that salt can't fix. The salsa was delicious. I know a lot of the other reviews talked about the poor service. I was surprised about how long it took us to be greeted and for our order to be taken during an odd day lunch out. In addition no offer of a refill for our salsa was give.  

At $2.50 for a corn tortilla sized taco, this place is a bit pricey even if it was taco Tuesday's but it was delicious. This place won't be a one a week eat out option but for an occasional date would be perfect.  For the two of us the bill ended up to be $25 and my wife surprisingly mentioned that she wasn't filled which I never heard before. 

This place would be a 5 star if the service was tightened up and a little less expensive on the pricing. Although the price is now pretty much on par with where downtown Gilbert is headed."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great service, their bartenders were fun and friendly.  Good food, and festive atmosphere.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I adore Chef Sylvania and if you get a chance, chat up with her at the restaurant. She is a passionate woman about everything and her face shows the delight in cooking for you. The spot itself is perfect for lazy weekend outings on the patio or crowd around with the happiest people at the communal tables and bar. Staff is always personable and I often wonder if they are sipping from the wall stocked bottles of tequila. Hey why not?

I think my big appetite can never eat enough here. Have the guacamole table side. Ask for extra jalapeno if you want a kick with some more sprinkles of pomegranate to ease the hot level. I love it so much, I recreated this recipe at home. The tacos are served on really tiny tortillas and it never fails that make a hot mess on my plate. With their 3 tacos for $10, I highly suggest ordering a 6-pack which would barely put a dent in your flat abs. Trust me. I always go with the carne asada, al pastor, and the carne asada huevo. Who refuses egg on steak? Seriously. Here's an insider scoop, ask for their tequila passport if you sit at the bar. For every tequila you try, they let you collect stamps to ink your drinking adventure. Drink up, tequila is their happiness. I won't judge since I probably may be sitting right next to you with the biggest smile from ear to ear.

I will say I was surprised that for Taco Tuesday, they did not have a lot of specials that made it my go to spot for this weekly type of outing. I guess I expected them to entice me to stay longer, at least til closing time."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. My husband loves Mexican food and we absolutely loved this place. The decor is so fun and the service is amazing. Hands down favorite chips and salsa I've ever had. The mole was really good along with the corn and the ceviche. I wouldn't pass this place up I loved it here and I'd come again."}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this place. Patio dining is superb. Great tacos and margaritas. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  The service was good, our waiter was really on top of refilling our drinks and checking in with us.  I ordered the Pollo en Crema Verde, which came highly recommended by our waiter. While the chipotle mashed potatoes were amazing, the chicken was disappointingly dry and gristly.  My friend ordered the Conchinita Pibil and said the pork just wasn't what she was hoping it would be. My husband ordered the brisket enchiladas and loved them.  I know we'll return to Barrio Queen, but next time I'll choose a different entree."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in Scottsdale & you are craving authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place. The chili verde burrito will not disappoint and the cocktails are fantastic! This is a must stop every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant, I mean REAL Mexican street food. There's a lot of competition in Scottsdale for Mexican food and this ones stands heads and shoulders above the rest."}
{"text":"First time at one of the Barrio restaurants.  The hostess staff was fantastic.  I was bringing in a large group and called the day before and they told me what a good trick would be to make sure I got a table for 10 people at 7 o'clock. I waited at the bar and had a drink and the table was ready before I knew it. We had a wonderful table outside that was perfect for our group. The only issue that I had was that I was not impressed with the food that I ordered. I ordered the specialty off of the entrée menu and it just wasn't very good. I'll try something different next time and hopefully have a better food experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! The girlfriend and I wanted to try a new place for Mexican food and we decided on barrio queen. We arrived and we were seated promptly. They gave us some chips and salsa and ordered some tacos.

THE TACOS WERE BOMB!

Individual wise they can get pricey but they are so worth it! Will definitely come back for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Their food is worth every penny! Their serving size does not disappoint. You get fresh Mexican food and no matter how full you are, you will wish you can keep eating."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try the new Barrio Queen in Gilbert having been to the Scottsdale location several times. The food, drinks and service have always been excellent in Scottsdale. We arrived at 6 PM and were told the wait was 40 minutes, we went to the bar and had a drink while we waited. Unfortunately the bartender seemed only interested in getting our order done and then ignoring us for the rest of our time there.  The 40 minute wait turned into an hour and five minutes. No problem still, we were enjoying the people watching and a good conversation. We would've loved an appetizer but the non-attentive bartender didn't offer. When we finally got our table we were starving. The waiter was great, attentive and took our order promptly. We had chips, a nice roasted corn appetizer (excellent) and the waited anxiously for our entrées. And we waited and waited and waited. 2 other tables seat after U.S. With larger parties were served before us. Interestingly enough those tables ordered the same entrées we ordered. And hour and ten minutes later our food was delivered. While the server apologized several times he never offered to do anything more, a manager never stopped by to explain what was happening and we were left disappointed with the service of this restaurant.  3 tacos and a carnitas dinner plate took an hour and ten minutes!  The food was good, the rinks were good but the service, customer care and general restaurant organization sucked. I expected a lot better from this place especially for the price."}
{"text":"The meat and potatoes of a Mexican restaurant are chips, salsa and margaritas. As well as guacamole.  It failed on all 4.  Salsa and guacamole were bland except for the onion taste. The chips were hard, cold and greasy tasting. No taste to the house margaritas.   I wasn't surprised to learn that Silvana is not running the show and has sold it to Barrio Concepts who own the other 2 in the valley.  The Desert Ridge location has been opened for a month but it's no excuse to have bad and bland food that's due to Nash and Rosenfield take on Mexican food. What a shame. We won't be returning and will warn others not to go b"}
{"text":"The service is really bad, the Mexican food is really overrated. There are much better places than this."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, and I didn't ; not even a little. The hurried and unprepared staff made the food just taste so-so. The place is beautiful and looks like it comes with lots of experience and knowledge of the food, but that's not the feeling my husband or I came away with on our lunch date this past week. 
The place looks beautiful and in a great location, but feels like a fast food joint. Next time, let me order at the window, give me a number and I can pick up my food and drink a lot faster. Heck, serve up the tapas in wax paper and save some dishes if you are trying to be green. Thanks, but not thanks."}
{"text":"Place is very good.  Got the table side guac which was amazing.  For dinner I got the 3 for $10 tacos which were also incredible.  My only criticisms were the tacos are two bite tacos and I got the infused water for $5 which was full with ice.  Literally had two drinks if it and it was gone.  Still a 4+ restaurant in my book."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere and upscale Mexican food it is a sister restaurant to barrio Café which is the original. I loved the sangria and jalapeño infused margarita. Great homemade chips and salsa. Really delicious authentic food. Can't go wrong on the menu. Service could've been a little better, our server didn't really have a lot of personality was mainly just an order taker."}
{"text":"Food was good, as always, but our server was...hungover? Confused? Not sure what but...we honestly had a choice of laughing it off or getting mad. We chose to laugh. 

That being said - great guacamole, excellent tacos, and the Sonoran hot dog was given a thumbs up. I do hope we never get the youngest Kardashian server again. You can only laugh some things off for so long."}
{"text":"Great menu, nice ambiance, and fast waiter.  if you like a new twist on traditional recipes or fresh guacamole made at your table, this is a good place for you.  i always get cheese enchiladas, and was pleased to find a spinach enchilada with goat cheese and cream sauce. Something different, and very good. My uncle got enchiladas with crumbled, spicy beef on top, also great."}
{"text":"The table side guacamole is awesome.  The vibe is great.  Tacos are small, so do a full order, but they are super tasty.

My wife and son both loved the place... and almost ordered a second table side guacamole!

It's worth the trip to the Heritage District."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this restaurant. It's close to where we live and has a far better than average menu. But, as the saying goes, the menu is not the meal. 

We were disappointed right away: the chips were thick, tough and tasteless. The salsa looked beautiful, but had almost no flavor. The guacamole was only fair (the avocado was mostly tasteless but we didn't downcheck them for that; avocados vary a lot). Everything looked fresh, but had little flavor. (How do you remove the flavor from cilantro and the heat from jalapenos?)

Normally I would go for the carnitas, but with pibil, al pastor and pollo mole on the menu, I was torn. I went for the mole even though I assumed that the butterflied chicken breast it was served on would likely be overcooked (it was); the mole itself was better than most, however. The beans and rice were decent, though under-seasoned and not as flavorful as we would have liked. 

The carne asada enchiladas were only fair. The meat was chewy and lacking in flavor. It's served with beans (decent) and vegetables (which we tasted and left uneaten).

Service was unremarkable, probably because the kitchen was soooo slow (on a Sunday afternoon and not particularly busy). Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back to Texas. Good atmosphere and they actually had Mexican music playing unlike places called Mexican back in Texas but playing Caribbean music. Had the steak torta, meat had good flavor but bread was chiabatta not torta bread. My wife had the mole. Was good but not made from scratch, they use Mole Dona Maria brand. Overall good and authentic plus, salsa and chips and horchata water really good."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Nothing extraordinary. Friendly people.

I liked their tacos. Chips and salsa was nice as well."}
{"text":"Victor and Nicole were outstanding at the bar!!! Very personable. Tacos and burrito can't be beat."}
{"text":"What a great place to dine with friends and family.  Ten of us were seated outside as it was a beautiful day.  Our waitress was very friendly and helped us order from their vast menu as this was my 1st time there.  We ordered a round of drinks, appetizers and then lunch.  Our waitress was awesome as she kept everything coming without missing a beat.  Everything was perfect.  As it was Sunday, we all enjoyed watching Football on several of their TV's.  If you like Mexican food, this is certainly the place to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Beau did a solo revisit. Tacos underwhelming and service uninspiring. That sums it up folks."}
{"text":"Has changed owners. Food is still good. Happy hour portions and selections have changed. Much smaller portions. Waiter couldn't turn the table over fast enough. Not a fun place anymore!
Will not return. Very, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went back to barrio queen on my visit to Scottsdale and must admit... pretty average. We got guacamole this time around, which is supposed to be their speciality but I was not impressed. Love that they make it fresh for you by your table but they didnt even ask how we like it made, and they made it way too spicy. Also, there weren't enough avocados in it and they put pomegranate on top... unique but I wasn't a fan. Chips were also a bit stale. Still enjoyed my evening, but food was not quite as good as I remembered the first time.  

Still loved the ambiance and unique taco menu with all the diffident options. See previous review for more!"}
{"text":"I love going to local establishments.  Having eaten TexMex, New Mexico Mex and California Mex, it was some time for Arizona Mex.  This place does not disappoint.  The tacos really rock and the choices were plentiful.  I didn't experience bad service as some of the other reviewers noted.  I enjoyed it, but maybe because of TexMex and CalMex, I acquired a taste for those places first.  Give them a try.  Located in Old Town, you can't find a better location to have a bite to eat.  Plenty to do before and afterwards as well."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!!! Adrian is such a delightful and accommodating server.  Every time I take any family/friends in I am guaranteed perfect and professional service!!! Adrian is a keeper and very much appreciated !!! Thanks Barrio Queen"}
{"text":"Dined here with my mom on Sunday at 11:00 am. It took sometime to get seated although there were only 2 other people dining there. Water was brought to the table in cloudy water spotted glasses. order 2 iced tea's. These glass were unatractive also. Menus were sticky and dirty. Ordered the 1/2 order of guacamole with chips. Nothing special there. Got 3 tacos. I the queens specialty,1 smoked salmon and 1 chicken. I took a small bit of each. The beef tasted odd. The Salmon was gross. Chicken one was terrible too. I ordered some pico de gallo and it tasted old. Mom had beef taco and it was unedible. We sent our food back and went next door to The Herb Box and had an excellent luch. Run don't walk from Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week recap-

House margarita: Can't expect too much from a house margarita so I'll leave it at that. No I won't; the house margarita was watered down and was not worth the calories.

Barrio guacamole: so much extra stuff in it, I barely tasted the avocados. The lime juice was especially overpowering. I did enjoy the crunch of the pomegranate seeds.

California enchiladas: Not a fan of the five chile red sauce, which had a smoky/spicy flavor and not much else going on. The inside of the enchiladas reminded me of the cheese inside a mozzarella stick after it's been sitting there a while. I'm all for vegetables, but the side of zucchini didn't have any special flair and just seemed kind of random.

Churro: Queen of the barrio, as far as I'm concerned. I could have chugged a pitcher of that caramel sauce. Five stars for the churro."}
{"text":"My husband and I went Friday night happy hour.  The service was great, they were very busy.  It is a very nice place, good crowd, we sat outside.  Everyone has different taste.  Just saying.  We had the Cocktel De Elote aka street corn, delish.  We both went through that.  Also the Cartinas En Chile Verde.  The decription sounded yummy, but was not very good, we left most of it.  And then also we had the Carne Asada street tacos, bland, not alot of flavor.  The chips were good and the salsa was good.  My husband loved the salsa, for me it had a late burn that cought up with me.  We might try it again, try something else on the menu, always willing to give a place a second try.
Happy hour, three apps and we each had two drinks / beer and wine - $40 plus tip"}
{"text":"Visiting the area. Hotel concierge recommended. Very new restaurant so some kinks to work out. 
The food was average. Great ambiance although pretty loud with sound voice effect. Sat in bar area. 
When we arrived we were on a wait list. Quoted time 45 min. Nice text wait list. Very busy do we were excited to try it. 
Although our link on wait list quoted 60 minutes with 19 groups ahead (party of 2). We were seated in 14 min!  Lots of parties if 4 or more were being told 60-90 minutes and dome left. 
Nest name and concept. Pricey for the quality. 
Mexican is our default food. 

Not terrible but not as good as we had hoped."}
{"text":"Came in opening night and Anthony was my bartender.  Such an awesome time, Ive been back several times and will wait to sit at the bar just to see Anthony.  Highly recommend.  Great food, best drinks."}
{"text":"We came here as a recommendation and are really enjoyed the traditional flavors and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Food is great here.  Had the Enchiladas Suizas and ceviche.  Both were great and reminded me of home made authentic Mexican food.  Angel was an excellent server"}
{"text":"I really like this place because the food is excellent.  You just cannot beat their tacos - that's what I always order.  They are great.

The location is good, too.  It's pretty easy to park for free, which is nice (and not like Phoenix, which charges a fortune - thank you, Scottsdale).  

I've always gotten good service here, too - very attentive and nice servers.

I recommend that you try Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best guacamole I've ever had! It was fresh and had sweet pomegranate seeds mixed in. I've never had that combo before and it was to die for. 

Three tacos for $10 was a delicious deal. Attentive wait staff and cool decor. Definitely a place to visit.  The cocktails were pretty spectacular, too. I got the white sangria."}
{"text":"this place is delicious!!! I've been here several times and haven't tried any of the actually entrees, but the tacos are YUM!! Yea, they're on the smaller side, but its so great to taste so many different kinds of tacos without get full on just two.  Drinks are great too!! It's so nice to sit on the patio in the middle of Old Town.  I've taken out of town guests here and everyone I've taken has loved it as well!"}
{"text":"My bf seems to really like the tacos. Table side guacamole not worth $14, no way. Overall the food isn't bad. I had two margaritas and terrible headache the following day which means it wasn't a quality tequila. Will likely go back for tacos but not guac or margaritas!"}
{"text":"God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco. 

Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos. But hey, Barrio is a great deal with a good atmosphere and totally worth it for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been great; great food, service, and atmosphere. There was an employee named Angel, he was so kind and a great server. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First time to Barrio Queen. Food was fair for Mexican. Would go back and try again. Busy street for nightlife after so location is sweet for a date."}
{"text":"First timer and probably only timer. Queen enchiladas were recommended by server and I was disappointed. Bland and lacked the cornucopia of flavor that was promised. The grilled veggies were fresh."}
{"text":"AMAZING. My family and I ate there tonight and I could have stayed there forever. Our server, Sherri was wonderful (she is from Alaska and shared great stories!!). All the servers were friendly! The food was not your average Mexican food! Very different flavors and lots to choose from. We had the summer sea bass special with mangos, fresh veggies and rice. It was great! Also we had the Barrio Pollo and Carne Asada tacos. SO GOOD! The Queso Fundido was a delicious appetizer. Everything was hot when it came out and tasted very fresh. I know there are a lot of Mexican places, but this place's flavor was very distinct. I recommend trying Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"The ratings by other Yelpers was accurate .. YELPERS! Food is expensive and average ... $15 Marg with Don Julio... $4.00 taco's ( small ) and stuffed chili with chicken was$19.00 , ... best item was the fresh of the guacamole& chips.. -- probably be back for Happy Hour sometime but will pass on dinner or lunch ..  2 for dinner and 2 drinks each and the bill was 90.00... Oh we'll.."}
{"text":"Just an FYI... you shouldn't put 2 orders in the same container... ALLERGIES! tsk tsk tsk"}
{"text":"Just went for the third and final time on 1/27/17......nice waiter, poor service cold food.....

Server extremely kind. 

This was our second visit and we brought friends along hoping we would have a repeat of our first visit: room temperature food. 

Unfortunately, without mentioning our latest visit, our friends noted their food was not hot. As a matter do fact, all of our dos was room temperature to cold. The place was busy and impeded our willingness to have the food heated up in a microwave. 

The low temps took away from the flavor and in some cases heightened the lack of seasoning in the carne asada burrito I ordered. 

Hoping they get it right; street tacos were 2out of 5 stars and eclipsed by Joy Ride Tacos a block away. 

BEST margarita I've had in a long time by the way!"}
{"text":"After driving down Gilbert rd and seeing the infamous barrio queen sign, I immediately told my partner that we were going there instead of another taco place around the corner.

Barrio queen is a place that is always on lists to try and I knew it would be my chance that Tuesday night! 

We got seated immediately, and our server was nice. They weren't that busy and I ordered a margarita, the spicy one, de los muertos, it was okay. Not really the spice I was looking for. But since it was Tuesday we both ordered three tacos each, and the table side guacamole that was divine. The guac was fast. My food came out after twenty minutes. Then my partners food came out five minutes later...the issue was it wasn't his food. The orders got mixed up, which was the food runners fault. The table behind us got my boyfriends order and my boyfriend got their order. It took a bit to track a server down and when we did the table behind us got their food (as my boyfriend didn't touch it) and then we waited for his. 

I will say that it was nice of the manager to comp my boyfriends tacos! And the tacos themselves were definitely tasty. We'll be back and hopefully I can give them a better rating because I really do like the food! Just the food runners and wait times for food were less than stellar."}
{"text":"I have been at Barrios before and totally enjoyed the food and the service.  Had friends come from out of town today, had lunch and had a fantastic time.  Corey recommended several things on the menus and they were fantastic.  His service and recommendations were fantastic.  We will definitely return and request him."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and love this place.  They have only been open a short time and the place is packed.  They have a great selection of tacos including a cactus one that is very good.  The house taco is the Cochinita Pibil which is pork marinated in sour orange with pickled sour orange onions.  Yum. The Mole Enchilada was very good.  The Carnitas Chile Verde appetizer is very good and on their happy hour.  We love taco Tuesday.  A great way to try different tacos.  The house Margarita is good.   It is not your regular Mexican restaurant.  If you want your food smothered in sauce with lots of iceberg lettuce and melted cheddar cheese this is not the place for you. If you read description of the entrees you will see where the recipes originate and how diverse this menu is. Last week it was 108 here and was too hot to really eat.  The server recommended the Gazpacho.  It was great and very well seasoned.  Was sorry to hear other people had bad service experiences.  We have always had very good service."}
{"text":"I was pretty pleased with this place. I don't remember The name of what I ordered, but it was one of the house specialties. It was fine, just not to my taste. The service was really good as well. The only thing I could ask is that they would offer flour chips as my sister is allergic to corn. It would've been much appreciated."}
{"text":"Good Atmosphere, good food, ok service, not worth $20+/person. Would only come back for taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"The guacamole is what deserves a five star review! The pomegranate seeds add such a flavor kick, it's melt in your mouth! 

The overall menu and service is pretty good, but nothing that stands out."}
{"text":"Horrible greeters. Rude & gave us the attitude immediately after asking for a table. Never coming again. If you want to be talked downed to ... This is your joint."}
{"text":"Fun new place! The cocktails we had were outstanding and the staff was great. Also loved the decor. The wait was longer than estimated and food took a loooong time to come out. I had a variety of tacos and was sad there was no side. Husband had the Sonoran hot dog, he said it was good but would go with tacos next time."}
{"text":"Service was great, waiter was really nice and the chicken jalapeño tacos were yummy but everything else was just okay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. They do an excellent job of updating traditional fare. I adore the cochinita pibil tacos. The staff are always super friendly to us"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  I have been here numerous times and it is always fantastic.  My favorites are the al pastor tacos and the carne asada with chorizo tacos...so good!  The chips and black bean dip which come complimentary with all meals is delicious.  The food is fresh, flavorful and very tasty.  It's also nice that there is a public parking lot next door so you don't have to fight for a parking spot."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place - especially considering that our Yelp community manager had been and had given it a 4-star rating. We arrived and were surprised at how beautiful the place was, for some reason I had expected something less high end. Anyhow - being a warm night we sat outside to enjoy the ambiance.  
The restaurant was quite busy - our server was a young lady who was quite curt. She lacked any warmth at all - she seemed as if everything was an inconvenience.  Traditionally, Mexican restaurants serve salsa and chips and it seemed to be the case here.  She asked if we wanted to start with Guacamole  - a house specialty, we didn't. Instead, we said, can we just have salsa and chips instead? She said, \" Yah, I'll bring you some\". but seemed genuinely irritated by it. 
Bear in mind, this is after upselling us to 2 signature $15 margaritas  ( 30 USD) . Every time she walked away from the table we were like \" what is up with her?\"

I ordered a California burrito ( a vegetarian one) as did my hubby - and despite the amazing reviews online for the food they were decidedly average. I have definitely had better. 
I came prepared to be wowed by the food, but the average food combined with the snarky server had us both wishing that we had gone elsewhere. I have had much better food at San Diego Taco Stands- with happier service too."}
{"text":"The service here was OK the first time we went but the kitchen was out of everything, even tortillas!  I realized everyone has a bad day and really wanted to give them a second chance.  I went back the other night and was just as disappointed in the service and quality of the food.  The one thing they do great is the guacamole.  With that said, the quality of the other dishes was sub-par.  The pork was so tough it was almost beef jerky like.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  The Fish on the tacos was soggy and cold.  The server was so overly pushy with trying to get me to buy the most expensive tequila for a margarita that I just changed my drink order to water.

Overall, for the prices they charge one would expect well seasoned, properly cooked, and overall nicely plated food.  That's just not the case.  It's been bland, tough, cold, dry and disappointing every time I've tried it.  This place could do so much better and really be a great place to eat with a large group of friends or on a romantic date.  The kitchen doesn't seem to care and the wait staff just wants to up-sell and is not very knowledgeable with questions about the menu.

I gave Barrio Queen two chances, and will not give it a third.  I can not recommend Barrio Queen at all."}
{"text":"Not sure why some give poor reviews, this place has great street tacos and the chopped salad is outstanding.  My favorite is the the chorizo azul"}
{"text":"Tacos were surprisingly bland. The barrios papas were more tasty than any of the 6 tacos between my date and me. Not in a rush to come back, not on the top of my recommendation list. The service was great with friendly staff though."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were great and our server Bre made the experience even better.  Not only will I be back for the great food, I will ask for Bre again!  I highly recommend the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"We went last night hoping for a table for 3. We were told an hour - no big deal, as we were walk-ins. Meanwhile, tables were open all around us in the bar. We asked about those seats and were quickly dismissed hearing how busy they were. When we finally left, those tables were still open and the bar service was slow and discourteous. With so many options in the area, I'd advise picking a place that actually provides customer service."}
{"text":"Real good, cool atomosphere. Wait staff was fast and friendly without being overbearing."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar and the bartender was great! Told us about different kinds of tequila and just really friendly. We have the queso and salsa. Great flavor and loved the mushrooms in the queso. Great spot to grab a drink and relax with friends for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened. I finally had the chance today. We sat outside on the patio. The weather was great but after a while we realized it was bad idea. The flowers from the trees were falling all over the place - in the food in the drinks. However, once the food came we almost forgot about the pedals. 
I ordered the Pozole Verde and it was FANTASTIC, unlike any I've had before. It's almost as good as mine... but different. It tastes slow cooked and the tomatillo flavor adds a nice facet. The salsa with the chips was very good as well. They have a habanero salsa if you ask. 
I ordered three tacos - Barrio Pollo con Chorizo, Cameron Asado, Carne Asada y Huevo. The shrimp taco was average and the beef taco with egg was interesting and delicious. But the chicken and chorizo was amazing! I could have had a few of those. There were many tacos on the menu and I'll be back to try them all.
We were stuffed after our meal and didn't try any dessert but I'll definitely get back to that.
The decor of the inside of the restaurant was a little cliche but not overdone. It isn't an intimate place. Its more family/friend oriented. I will be sampling some of their huge selection of tequila soon. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful even if they couldn't keep all the flowers from falling in everyone's plates. :-)"}
{"text":"We eagerly anticipated the opening of Barrio Queen. Barrio Cafe in downtown Phoenix has been a favorite for year, with the only downside being the 35 minute drive to Phoenix. Barrio Queen opening in Gilbert is only a short 10 minute drive from my Chandler residence. 

Compared to Barrio Cafe:
Queso Fundido: Too much mushroom, not enough chorizo. Definitely not as thick and creamy as the Barrio Cafe Queso Fundido. Barrio Cafe wins.

Margaritas: So on par. Compared to the Barrio Bomba, the Queens cooler is very equal. HOWEVER steer clear if you do not like coconut. The taste of coconut is very overwhelming. The Casa  (house margarita) was standard. Just a good margarita no complaints. The options for fruitier margaritas were non existent. So 
Barrio wins.

Entrée: I had the The Queen Enchilada with chicken and my friend had the Carne Asada Torta. The Torta was really good. Had a lot of meat, it had cheese, avocado, peppers, onions - it was really good. For $12 it was a really good portion for the amount of food. The enchiladas were really good - except for the spinach. I hate spinach and this did not make me a fan of spinach. I have to say the food at Barrio is equal to Barrio cafe.

Other stuff: Waitress, Norma, was decent. Decorations were great. Artwork was fabulous. It was a very chill and comfy atmosphere. 

Overall, Barrio Cafe is better, however I am excited to come here again."}
{"text":"The service was ok.  No refills because the server never came back after the meal was delivered.  Forgot our appetizer, but got it lickety split after we got our meal.  I had the Nogada.   Fabulous but not worth $24 for a chili relleno in white sauce.  My son had the Azteca..bad pork for $19.  The tortillas are the size of sand dollars.  I would recommend it if the price was cut in half.  Not worth the price.   Of course both dishes were the \"recommended\" dishes...also the most expensive."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome vibe and the service in the restaurant and at the bar is awesome. Prices are reasonable.  Boom!  Highly recommended. The staff in all areas are the main reason we keep coming back."}
{"text":"We met a friend here for a dinner a couple of weeks ago based on her recommendation.  We hadn't been to Barrio Queen since it opened, so decided to have an open mind and give it another shot.  Our biggest complaint last time was service and that was quickly overcome...we had a great server that was attentive and super helpful.  I ordered the enchiladas suizas and again, they were good, but not great...I keep comparing them to Barrio Cafe and there is just no comparison.  Overall, a great experience - lively atmosphere, nice decor, great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Hip place in a cool part of town. Parking is a pain, so you should probably plan to circle a few times, but that allows you to get the lay of the land like pioneers so it's all good.

Food was great - definitely recommend the tableside guacamole, and it's tough to go wrong with any of the entrees. 

Don't plan on this place for a quick in and out. It'll probably be slam-jam-thank-you-ma'am packed. That's not a bad thing, though. Go with a group (or just a few), plan to get a few drinks, post up outside, and enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Our first time here, the server David is amazing. He guided our visit and everything was incredible. When we return we will surely ask for him! And the Paloma margarita"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars for atmosphere but aside from that I wasn't impressed. Salsa was a little too spicy for me, tableside guacamole was different but not great, tacos were good but a little cold, and our server was so nice but appeared he had too many tables which resulted in the service not being great. 

Given the fact that this is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with many places to choose from this wouldn't be my top pick."}
{"text":"Have returned since my first visit and they have vastly improved their service.  Not my favorite place, but other people seem to like it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here first, each getting the 3 taco plate.  I have to say, the Carne Adovada y Huevo was my favorite on the menu.  That fried egg on top was just the right ticket.  My husbands favorite was the Cochinita Pinil one.  We ate again last night, Taco Tuesday, this time sitting at the bar.  Service was great, both bartenders did a great job making sure we were taken care of despite it being happy hour and there were lots of folks coming up trying to get drinks while they waited for tables."}
{"text":"I got the 3 taco options. Carnita, Pescado and Carne Asada. All were tasty. Great service. The chips and salsa are yummy too!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what our area needed. We had a long wait, nearly two hours and were originally quoted 45 min. The manager Eric, was wonderful. He made sure the kids had chips and salsa to help tie them over and made certain we were taken care of as well. While waiting, the artist who created the art in the entry way, entertained the kids by showing them his interactive art and it was fun for them to play with. Once seated, our server was Courtney. We love her. She gave great recommendations, was familiar with the menu, and silly with the kids. The restaurant was chaotic, busy, and lots going on as it was opening weekend. You would have never known it from her service. She was simply the best!  Our food was delicious...everything we had was amazing. The Chile verde was perfect, the table side guacamole is a must, and the adult churro dessert can't be missed. I'm excited for them to get settled as this will be a regular go to for us. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday for lunch and the service wasn't good. I think there was only one server on though. Thats not a good thing if your looking to get in and out for your one hour lunch break. Made me very late back to work. She took 15 min just to get our water and then made a comment about us needed out bills separated. She never gave us a chance to tell her...Good food. I would even try it again despite the bad service. Taco were the tiniest things I have ever seen though! Mixed about this place."}
{"text":"So when in Downtown Gilbert the options are remarkably plentiful for a single street. Barrio Queen was off to an auspicious start with 3 drinks making their way to the table and not being liked. The salsa was average and the chips were a little thick for my preference..... And then it happened.... I ordered the Barrio Pollo burrito and my goodness was it ridiculously delicious. The spice rubbed chicken was moist and not over powering, the pinion cream sauce brought all the components together for an forgettable bite! I highly recommend this burrito.... The wait times are a little outrageous for the entire experience so call ahead, get it to go and go sit and people watch with a great burrito!"}
{"text":"This location is just not good at all. First time I went, they were fairly new so even though my carne Asada enchiladas were terrible compared to Scottsdale, I wanted to give them another chance. 2nd time I tried them I brought guests from out of town and it was okay at best. 3rd time my husband and I went for dinner and the chips were disgustingly greasy and food was mediocre, swore it off after that. But then tonight we were trying to go to joyride and their wait was 1.5 hours, so we went to barrio queen instead because my husband wanted to give it a shot since they had no wait. Tacos were incredibly boring and overloaded with red onion. I ordered one shrimp taco and there was barely 1 shrimp in it. Margaritas were okay, chips were greasy again. What turned us off the most was the service- terrible! Will never go back to the gilbert location!"}
{"text":"It was nice to try once but pricey and will not come back.  Bob tried their award winning entree it was a two star entree called Cochinta Pibil.  I had the Spinach Salad with grilled chicken.  That was good.  I din't like Bob's dish either.  The wait time was 46 minutes.  It took another 45 minutes to get food.  We were ready and ordered as soon as we were seated."}
{"text":"The bar is good for drinks and good bar service with chips and salsa.  The bartender was great.
 The food is just ok. Feels like a tourist trap. Waited for a table they were supposed to text and never got a text, then rude response from hostess when asking about our table. Sat outside after the waiting for a table at the bar for 40 min, the table server seemed ready to go home and gave very poor service.  Never asked if we wanted drinks.  He came and asked to pick up the receipt before we were even ready to leave.  It's not like we were sitting there very long.  Poor server etiquette.  Will not return because of the poor service the food was mediocre at best.  One of the employees was stinking up the bathroom in a stall, nothing worse than that except for picking up your tip before the table is ready to leave."}
{"text":"Tried Barrio Queen on Wednesday. I have very much been looking to a new location from this chef and to see lights on again in the space formerly occupied by my beloved Metro Brassiere. I am not a tequila drinker (yes, lame, I know) and the only options on the menu were margaritas and beer. I asked the waiter if there was anything else and he recommended a cosmo. It was $15, which I think is a little steep, but it featured Grey Goose and was amazing, not too strong, not too tart or sweet. Definitely a pleasant surprise for a Mexican restaurant. My friend and I split the guacamole, which seems to be the same pomegranate seed-speckled variety as featured at Barrio Cafe, and just as delicious. We did the combo option, which allows you to pick from a list of 6-8 entrees and comes with black beans and a cabbage slaw. The beans were mostly pureed/mashed - the flavor was great but I would have liked a little more texture. The slaw was also a little bland, but the cochinita pibil and chile verde were awesome. The cochinita pibil is, again, the same or similar to the recipe served at Barrio Cafe and is my favorite item there. The chile verde had some good spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it overwhelmed the flavors. They played awesome varied Mexican music in the background, the servers were attentive and friendly, and the sparkly bronze-colored seats, big jars of aguas frescas and other decorative touches make for an attractive comfortable setting. 

The waiter carefully packaged our leftovers, and I made huevos rancheros with my leftover beans, cochinita pibil and chile verde. If it's possible, they actually tasted better after a day or two. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a sad disappointment. 
We had high expectations for barrio queen, seeing they have all 4STAR reviews. 
We were greeted by a nice guy/waiter/possibly manager? I asked for options that were Gluten free and Dairy free. Barrio Queen, please educate yourself on this topic.
We sat at a bar booth for dinner, ordered table side guacamole for two. Let me just say this is my first experience EVER ordering $11 guacamole and it not being made at the table! Instead it came out in cubes with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top. There was no salt, no lime, no mashing, no nothing, but the sweet waitress \"threw some salsa on the side, just cause\". Wow..thanks, feeling \"special\"
After our guacamole we order some Pozole, which I will give them credit for, it was good.
We also ordered street tacos, 3 for $10, or 1 for $3.50. My fiancé ordered the Huevo con Chorizo, Suadero Azteca,and the Nopalitios. The Nopalitis was good, but the rest were luke warm, no salt and pretty much an epic fail at trying to make a Mexican taco. Our waiter recommend I try the Salmon y Nopal taco and Huitlacoche y Champion taco. OH.MY.CRAP. The salmon taco smelled like the seafood market in Chinatown. I had one bite and passed it off to my old man, he can eat about anything and find some sort of appreciation for it, but not this sad salmon taco. Mushroom taco, was lacking even the flavor of the mushroom. How one achieves that is beyond me. 
The margaritas were decent, I recommend just having those and some \"cubed\" guacamole."}
{"text":"After everyone raving about this place and Martha Stewart eating here we knew we had to go. We gave it three different tries. We are done. I fail to understand the appeal of this restaurant or how they stay in business. The food is decent, but don't be hungry or have any place to be as you'll be waiting. And waiting. That's after you've waited and waited for one of the empty tables. Then there is the completely incompetent, rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe in Phoenix and Barrio Queen have the best stylized  Mexican food in the state. They use healthy ingredients and they make their dishes with a fusion twist. I highly recommend their guacamole. I typically can't stand guac and I love it here. At Barrio Queen, they also have a sushi style street taco menu. It is fantastic and I find myself ordering on here more often than not. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was apologized for, from someone before we even saw our waiter. He said our waiter had a huge table inside, so right from the get go, my expectations were lowered. The food was bland and flavorless. My fish tacos....the meat was cold and tough, chewy. Gross. It was over 100 degrees, but we sat on the patio, the misters were on, but they turned them off, so I had a drip on my left shoulder all night. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Done my review  already on hoe much a love this new Restaurant! I'll differently be going back. Please read my review"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. The guacamole was amazing high recommend it. The chips were delicious & the tacos were yummy.  My family loved it. Our server was so nice and friendly as well as the hostess. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First time here, great food and service. Angel gave us great customer service, always attentive, friendly, kind, and respectful. Had the enchiladas and ceviche, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"A great looking restaurant with very good food and awesome service. They serve Chiles en Nogada which is definitely a rare item to see on any menu. They were surprisingly good considering how difficult those are to make. All of the other food was delicious as well and the place itself is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend for \"Taco Tuesday.\" Very cool atmosphere! The server was extremely nice and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Barrio Queen for dinner with my wife and son. We started off with chips and salsa. The chips looked to be homemade and the salsa was a smoked chipotle style (flavorful but not spicy) and was very good. My son ordered the California Enchilada with Pork, my wife ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and I ordered the Azteca Burrito. We also ordered a side of Chipotle Mashed Potatoes. All the food was very flavorful and very good. No complaints about the food at all. Our waitress was also very prompt and refilled our drinks often and the other servers also assisted when needed. The price of the dishes was a little high but the portions were large and filling. Overall I give the place 5 stars and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service and fun atmosphere. One of my newly discovered favorite Mexican food spots. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Sunday Funday Part 2. I'm a huge fan of downtown Gilbert and love that new places are popping up. My 2nd trip the the Barrio and my girlfriends 4th.  We sat down at the bar as usual. Slow afternoon, only a few tables filled and 4 other people at the bar. We both ordered a Modelo Especial on draft......so good. But I like a shot of silver tequila with my mexican beer, and going through the menu there isn't a shot under $8. I get the up sell part when our bartender tells me the reposado is better.......I get it. She then offered me an orange slice with cinnamon, and I politely declined. I like my silver tequila and my beer. WELL THATS THE MOST TRADITIONAL WAY TO DRINK TEQUILA........whoa whoa whoa.....settle down blondie.....your hair pulled back a little tight?  She must of took offense to my polite decline, because we had to ask 3 times for chips and salsa. Then we had the pleasure of listening to her bitch about her shifts for the next 10 minutes. 
AGAIN, I didn't get anything to eat, our bartender had a resting bitch face and made it very unpleasant to sit at the bar. Didn't like the vibe at all. I had a good experience here and a bad, I will give Barrio one more chance on our next Sunday out. Hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"Great food, very authentic Mexican with a great beer and drink selection. We had a blast, the staff was awesome"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. 
TACO TUESDAYS!
Love the Salmon Y Mango taco.
The Pescado taco is also really good.

Every taco I've tried there is good and it was the first time I've ate cactus. Not my favorite item of food, I'm assuming it's categorized as a vegetable....?
I love margaritas but I prefer frozen however they don't offer frozen just as many restaurants in the Phoenix area don't. With that said, they offer great margaritas.

Love the environment. Modern Mexican, yet comfortable and not pretentious. Great selection of tequila and a staff that knows the menu."}
{"text":"I will never have the tacos here again, and that's if I come back. Barrio was my favorite Mexican place until this afternoon. Apparently my taco Tuesday special came with a very solid case of food poisoning! I am so totally disappointed, and I don't think the memory of this will have me back over there any time soon... I had the carne asada, pollo y chorizo, chorizo and the fish one (pesca-something) and one or some combination of them had my stomach in pieces an hour later, and with my head in the trash can by 4pm. Ugh, Barrio, why??? We were so good together"}
{"text":"Cool concept, OK food, and good drinks but poor service and expensive. 

Update, I went there again with some friends - MUCH better service! Still spendy but everyone seemed to enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"This place seems to have nice decorations and our glasses of water stayed filled... but those were really the only two positive points. From the moment you walk in the hostess is not very friendly or welcoming. The sense is that they are just doing the minimum of what the job requires and you are perhaps inconvienencing them by requiring a seat. The server was slightly better.... but she also wasn't overly friendly and seemed more interested in hanging out at the hostess desk with the other girls. She did keep coming back though, promptly, and was cordial enough. They give you chips and salsa to start. I found the chips very fragmented and hard. The salsa was quite mild and finely grained- not chunky. My husband and I shared a Carne Asada burrito and beef brisket enchiladas... it took like 5 or so minutes to come out to us... it takes longer than that to get your food at Del Taco and Filebertos... which seemed  worrying. The meat was cooked nicely- the texture of the meat was good and it seemed juicy... but... it just didn't taste like anything. This burrito had no flavor. There was only a tiny drizzle of sour cream... Is this supposed to be trendy??  However, the food servings seemed like good portions in general. But this is probably the only burrito I couldn't eat more than a few bites of- in my life- because it just didn't taste like anything to me. The food seemed luke warm, like they had reheated it... which could explain the speed. The grilled veggies with the enchiladas seemed nice and crispy... The black beans seemed mushy and with only a few sprinkles of cheese... what kind? I could not tell you because I couldn't taste it. The enchiladas seemed watery (due to the brisket?) And the sauce was a way over powering citrus that punched you in the face. This does not resemble any type of Mexican food to me. Plot twist: This was actually our second time visiting. The first was around Christmas to get a gift card for my dad (sister's recommendation- clearly she has a taste for overpriced, designer looking resteraunts that are supposed to be 'hip' with subpar food) and only a manager could do this (apparently), and even though they weren't very busy - it took her forever to come out and she was not very friendly either. It's like-- do you people want my (or anyone's) money or not?? Both times there wasn't a lot of people in there (foreshadowing?), both times the customer service component just wasn't there... like, at all. I don't get a good vibe from this place. My husband and I won't be returning. To be honest they are lucky I gave them two stars!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Food is always good, and never disappoints. The tableside guac is a must. I've found that the guac is a little better in the winter seasons, when they add pomegranate seeds in with the avocado- it's amazing. Service here is just basic... nothing special there- but they get the job done."}
{"text":"The first time I went here with my husband for date night, I really wanted to love this place. The atmosphere is fun and I liked the Dia de Los Muertos theme, and a Spanish slang on the menu (comida a toda madre!). We ordered queso fundido and a skinny chola margarita and dos xx. Aright, so far so good but then...got street tacos aaand royally disappointed on the al pastor, and pescado. The Barrio pollo was good, but I've had better street tacos at tacquerias in the hood for a fraction of the cost. the service was good, but the food bleh. 

Went again about a week later with a girlfriend, sat at the bar and took forever for someone to even acknowledge us (it was NOT busy, still open seats at the bar and restaurant and was early Saturday). Ordered a drink to calm my irritated nerves, had a quirky male bartender who actually turned our bad start around. Left satisfied and this time ordered a pollo and a carnitas taco--bothsafe choices. Aright maybe this place is growing on me!

Went a third time for a hangover lunch and this is where I've concluded this place does not justify their pricey menu items. Waitress f'd up 2 of the 4 orders and while she quickly fixed it, her smug attitude was a turn off. I ordered a PORK green chili taco and it came with NO friggin' pork!!? It was just all green chile and onion, I mean come on?! Who is working back there in the kitchen? Only one way to describe their food-Americanized and not in a good way, they can't get it right and for $3.50 a taco I would expect better. I get $1.25 tacos better up the street on Gilbert and Broadway, but I might come here to get tipsy first because let's face it, you're paying to be trendy and check out Downtown Gilbert. That is a strong MIGHT."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!!  Best mexican food we have ever had, and we've had a lot!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. A little on the expensive side. Ambience is unique.very few options for vegetarians. I ordered chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"This was my second time in and will be my last if I have any say in the choice. Service was extremely slow, margaritas was weak. Our server seemed irritated that we had ordered and paid for cocktails at the bar before we were seated. The guacomole was good, I had an out of town guest, so the table side presentation was nice. We ordered two guac orders to start and were given one dinky basket of chips. Probably 12 total, getting chips for our guacomole was an ongoing struggle all dinner long. We were told they were making more, but watched as basket after basket passes our table.  
In other food choices, the Caesar was simple, under dressed, and I've had better at most places. The fish taco was not good, at all. The fish was funky, I had two other people take a small bite and we all agreed, not good at all. The other tacos we ordered were okay,  I've had better downtown and didn't try one I would have to come back for."}
{"text":"Everything was average to fair. I ordered the guacamole table side and the asked me how spicy and just brought out a pre made dish. The chips were too thick. The tacos I tried were fair. The Margarita was the only thing they got right."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The guacamole with extra cilantro and jalapeño is excellent. Even better is a dish called Camarones al Mojo. Translated it is Large Jumbo shrimp sautéed with garlic, poblano peppers and cilantro served over rice. This dish is a must have... one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever had period!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has excellent food. Their table side guacamole and tacos are wonderful! If you want great food for a great price, this is the place to go. However, the service is slow and the owner doesn't really seem to have interest in her customers. The owner also stopped serving chips and salsa as she wanted to represent a \"real mexican food restaurant.\" I think this was a terrible idea. All in all, Barrio Queen is in a fun location and the food makes it worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Came a year ago when I visited Phoenix and was very pleased. Came back this weekend to Phoenix and went again. Even more pleased! Yummy yummy tacos and nachos. Patio had heaters which were nice. Wait staff was all nice. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Wavering between 3-4 stars. This place is soooooo adorable. The atmosphere is really great. But the food was good, not great, and overpriced (in my opinion). 

I read other reviews which complained about slow service which we did not experience. The waitress greeted us promptly. We each ordered a draft beer and she brought chips and salsa then returned with our beer. The chips weren't my favorite - thick and a little greasy - but the salsa was good. They had a lot of margaritas on the menu and I was tempted to have a Paloma but it was $18 and I just don't see spending that much on a drink. That wasn't even the most expensive drink, either!

I ordered the Arizona burrito which was $12 and was green chili pork and smothered with a really good green sauce. It was huge. I put my fork on the plate with the photo to show the size of it. The pork was a little fatty for my liking but that is the traditional way it's made so I really can't complain. 

Hubby ordered the Azteca burrito which was also $12. Also humongous. It was beef brisket and rice and had a red sauce on half and green sauce on the other half. He also said it was good. We both only ate half and brought the rest home for another meal. $48 before tip for 2 burritos and 2 draft beers seemed pricey though. 

I might go back during a nice afternoon for happy hour on their great patio. Also the guacamole is supposed to be amazing but there were only the 2 of us and it was $14 they do prepare it table side)."}
{"text":"45 min to get drinks
1.5 hours to get cold food 
Condescending wait staff and MGMT 

Finally, I had to get our table silverware and plates from the bus station since that didn't seem to be important either. 

No apology for lack of service and respect of patronage. Manager was a complete POS with an attitude that doesn't belong in the service industry. 

We won't be back any time soon. Very poor experience."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with some friends. Awesome happy hour special on margaritas. 3 bucks! Brittany our server kicked ass. Had the table side guacamole. Never quite tasted guac like this. Very citrus style. Loved it. Carne asada burrito was from another planet. Great simple tastes. A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Casa Margheritas go down waaaaaaayyyyy to easy. The tacos - especially the brisket taco - is amazing. We had the enchilada Sunday night and that was excellent. The staff is friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. My wife and I are both gluten-free and they are very accommodating regarding food allergies. If you enjoy Mexican food this is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Have like the tacos on previous visits. On 1 visit chicken mole, the mole sauce was burnt. Servers took off our bill. Service can be hit or miss. Nice place and large menu of tacos and more."}
{"text":"Great for casual drinks and I like the atmosphere.  However,  I still prefer the original Barrio in central phoenix over this sister location."}
{"text":"I have only been for taco Tuesday (multiple times) but it never disappoints and is always a favorite of mine and my friends. The guacamole is made fresh, table side, and depending on the time of year includes fresh pomegranate seeds (or craisins when pomegranate is out of season). It seems that the only time people are disappointed is if they stray from the a la carte tacos and look towards the entrees which tend to be a bit pricier and not as good of a value. It can be a bit pricey unless you're there for taco Tuesday or happy hour, but, is still a more affordable and almost as great of an option as somewhere more \"upscale\" in Old Town like The Mission."}
{"text":"Getting much better!  Our second time here over a week ago with some friends. We were seated without any wait, but it took about ten minutes at the table before we were approached by a server. From there on we didn't have any issues. The service was good, and the food was way above par with a lot of Mexican restaurants I have had been to in the valley. Management really needs to consider working on thier salsa....too thin, and needs more flavor! The Pork Carnitas dish came in a cast iron skillet, and the pork was delicious, melt in your mouth tender, wth black beans, in a sauce with melted cheese! Everyone else enjoyed their food! Maintain a consistancy like this experience, and I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Every time we go we have a very good meal.
The wait staff are pleasant and attentive.
The guacamole is always excellent especially when pomegranate are in season as these seeds are added.
The Mexican coffee is always good and strong. French press is used and the coffee inexpensive as you are supplied with a full pot.
Everything we have tried is excellent.
I would strongly recommend trying this eatery."}
{"text":"My Barrio Queen margarita was so good that I wanted to spend the entire afternoon there and work my way through their entire list. While this was definitely the place, unfortunately, it wasn't the time and I stuck with just the one.

I like a good traditional margarita - tequila and lime on the rocks and nothing else, but the El Tamarindo on the menu talked me into upping my margarita game. Tequila, tamarind juice (I think), (fresh) lime juice and Tapatio hot sauce. The straw is coated in a tamarind paste. Lick the salt, bite the tamarind, drink the margarita - it's so good! Sweet, spicy and tangy all in one sip.

They've also got 400+ tequilas. GOOD LUCK!

Our service was super poor, but thanks to the other servers for picking up the slack of ours. She was super friendly! ...Just never around or available."}
{"text":"AAAhhhhh Barrio Queen. So, I've heard wonderful things about Barrio Queen from fellow yelpers. We were here for some cocktails last night. It's in a terrific area... trees were adorned with lights. Since I am a woman with the attention span of a fish... ooohhh look at the lights......

........

........

........


Okay, I'm back. We sat in the patio and I really enjoyed it. My man-friend is smittened by their Limon y coco - this is a margarita made with coconut infused tequila... it was okay. I'm not a fan - to make it a little \"authentic\", there were like grinded up coconut pieces which made it gritty(?). No thanks! I ordered the paloma which was a grapefruit, lemon/lime and mexican squirt (yes, we went to town with the jokes). OMG!! This was so terribly tart and tangy... I put two packs of raw sugar in it and I ended up leaving 3/4 of the drink. What a waste of $11. We did order the original and chocolate flan. The chocolate was way too decadent... I prefer the original."}
{"text":"oh my yummm!   BRAND NEW OPEN!!
ok, i have been a fan of barrio cafe for quite some time, so i was pretty excited that they were opening something so close to me (which was my biggest complaint of \"cafe\")   location yay!   they totally re-did super cute inside... a wee bit small.. but i'm ok w that... other half of their business not open yet,  curious how that will go.  servers very nice,  food fantastic, and the menu is quite extensive... i will need to eat there day and night to try all... happily!  yay love!!
OOOOPS. This never posted when new.. So add on update ;)
Still awesome!!!!  Yay!!!!"}
{"text":"As I predicted, another friend dragged me here yesterday for lunch. We got there at 1:05 pm, and got seated immediately.

It took over 10 minutes for someone to greet us and take out drink orders, but I could see they were at the end of their lunch rush, so give them a few minutes to check everyone else out and get back on track, right? No, the bad service continued even when the restaurant had a total of 3 occupied tables.

Needless to say, our drinks took way more time than they should have. Our table side guacamole was bland. My tacos did not come with the toppings listed on the menu. Our plates sat and sat. We had to ask for our server so we could pay and get the heck out of there...with our plates, bowls, glasses still sitting in front of us.

YIKES, will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I can't rant and rave enough about how good their product is.  The chips are tasty, so with their salsa.  I have had their brisket,  chicken, and pork tacos.  I have been here twice (and I will be undoubtedly returning), but their service is shakey.  One night it was tremendous while it was busy, our server was on it!  On a less busy night our server was busy hosting several sections throughout the establishment. If someone can tighten up the servers' sections, this place will become an easy 5/5 for me."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad and the service was good but way over priced in my opinion for what it is. $19 for a veggie chile relleno with 4 pieces of small shrimp. $15 for a chingorita (margarita with a coronita in it). $14 for a carne asada burro. The burro was huge though so there is one way to somewhat justify the price. Our total bill was $60 after tax and tip..for lunch. I didn't even have a drink."}
{"text":"After living here for 15 years, there are so many quality Mexican restaurants that are far superior.  Street tacos are overpriced, service was sub par, and when you have to request chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant you may need to rethink your choice.  The atmosphere is cool though."}
{"text":"I had a great time there when my parents came to town. A lot of dishes are Mexico City based food, so it's not just tacos and burritos. The guacamole is very good, and they make it at the table.  Get it with the cranberries!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly staff, great Happy Hour!

Get the guac! It isn't on the HH menu, but its delish!"}
{"text":"Although the restaurant has a very small dining area the atmosphere is great! Their nachos are by far the best I have ever had and their house margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The margaritas and guacamole are the best. The atmosphere is fun and the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Arizona hands down.  I've eaten at a ton of taco places and yes, I have given out a lot of 5 star reviews, but there is no way that this food can be considered anything less than top notch. I have eaten all of their tacos, the Nopalitos and the Chorizo with fried egg are to die for.  Also the Mole chicken enchiladas are legit.  Very authentic, and very tasty.  What I'm saying, is If you can come here and have a bad time, trust me its you not them.  Have a margarita and lighten up."}
{"text":"Not a good overall experience.

Nice atmosphere...but it all ends there.  Our server, who felt that she's too good to be there, was MIA for the most part.  That should've been a cue to get up and leave, but we decided to give it a go.  My hubby had the chicken enchilada with chili verde sauce.   Nothing worth noting, but he said it was good.  My little cutie pie had 2 shrimp tacos.  Mind you, each taco had ONE little battered shrimp in there for $4.75.  Flopping the hard corn tortillas about, he didn't feel that he was playing with his food because it was inedible.  So, for two pieces of medium sized beer battered shrimp came to $9.50! 

I was in the mood for a big bowl of menudo and taco al pastor.  The marinated pork was delicious.  I should've had a couple of that instead.  The menudo already had the red chile in it and chock full of tripe and hominy.  Hubby and son just glanced over to make a weird face at me right before I put a spoonfull in my mouth.  The good comforting flavor was there and so was a whole cup of salt.  I squeezed more lime in it to see if it will lessen the sea water.  

Our server came and I told her that I just can't eat the menudo.  She looks at the bowl with her hands around it and asks \"What did you want me to do with it?\"  She just gave me an attitude like it was my fault it was salty.  \"Well, if you squeezed lime in there, it brings out more of the saltiness.\"  What kind of bullshit was that?  I told her to send it back because it will give me high blood pressure!  In place of that horrible soup, I got the arrachera taco which dried my toungue up even more.  

I don't think I can give this place another chance.  I will, however, try Barrio Cafe someday.  It will surely be a better experince than this one."}
{"text":"Went last night to try it out. Love the ambiance of this place. Got there at 8 and was told it was a 45 minute wait. No worries, there is an awesome bar! Grabbed some drinks and managed to catch two seats at the bar as people were leaving. Olivia, our bartender was great! Actually, she made the night for us. She was very attentive to my requests for drinks, tweaking some of the menu items to fit my tastes. She served us for about an hour and then was off the clock but hung around grabbing some dinner for herself. When our new bartender told us that they were out of all of their dessert drinks and couldn't make me anything, Olivia overheard, came back up to the bar and proceeded to make me the perfect nightcap. She asked what I liked about the drinks on the menu and was able to modify and make her own concoction going back and forth to the kitchen to make it just right! Now this is the type of service that will keep me coming back! Food was good. Chips and salsa, tacos and green chili dip. The green chili dip had nice big chunks of meat but lacked any real type of flavor. I had to add salsa and salt to make it decent. Hubby liked it though. If they keep bartenders like Olivia around, this place will do great! Customer service is everything!"}
{"text":"They have excellent food and service. We went for a company lunch and they have this great homemade guacamole.  Their steak salad is huge and it's all you can eat chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever .  Brings me back to moms homemade cooking/ with a new chiefs twist."}
{"text":"Tried this place out. Service was awful. Had to wait a long place out. Never got offered refills."}
{"text":"Surprisingly crowded for a Tues lunch so my friend and I sat at the bar for our meal. Service was fast and friendly and The Queen Enchiladas were delicious! It would be great if they offered a lunch menu with smaller portions."}
{"text":"Still great. On my third visit I have not made it to main courses yet given the enticing taco variety.

I got the corn appetizer, which was simple but effective. 

Sadly, the smoked salmon taco is no longer. In its place I revisited the cochinita pibil, which was probably the best of the bunch. The carne asada with a fried egg was excellent.

I enjoyed the huitlacoche but I wonder if it's violating some culinary guideline to combine something mushroom-esque with actual mushrooms. The grilled shrimp was great - sort of a lighter version of blackened - but disappointing in its quantity (one.)

Overall, Barrio Queen continues to excel at the basics while developing intriguing juxtapositions."}
{"text":"Worst choice in Scottsdale! The server was beyond rude, it took us almost two hours to eat out dinner, the table side guacamole was gross and the server was one of the worst I have ever had. The food was overpriced for what you get, go to Baja Fresh and you get the same food... Actually twice as much for half the price."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! We got introduced to this place by a co-worker of my husband. The table-side guacamole is delicious, especially during pomegranate season. Get it with everything. Be aware though, this is not an American/Mexican restaurant, so the portions are not going to be huge. One of our favorites in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This was our favorite meal during our Scottsdale vacation.  We had breakfast and it was fantastic.  Such an innovative menu and everything  we had was delish.  Even an order of   decaf coffee was french pressed and served in a very large pot.  It was wonderful coffee and I am very hard to please.  I wish we had Mexican food like this in Ashland."}
{"text":"Dinner was great!  Went for a business meeting with our insurance agent who is from out of state. I try to take him someplace new and different every time he comes into town.  We started with the guacamole, and weren't too sure about the cranberries at first. So we only got a little of them.  Wished we would have gotten more!  

Sherrie, our server, recommended a couple of great dishes for us. We got the Cochinita Pibil and the Chiles En Nogada, excellent!!  Of course I had left overs for lunch today!!  No room left for dessert which is unusual for us.  

I would have given 5-stars but I didn't see the receipt until today and noticed we were charged for five margaritas and only had two each. I didn't pay the bill or I would have noticed last night before we left. 

If you go, ask for \"Sherrie\"!  She is awesome and very informative.  Great service!!"}
{"text":"This is a interesting New Mexican twist I've experience ... food was decent , services was better . I think I'll plan another time here in the near future . I defiantly love there drink selection"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is absolutely a five, the food though I will give a 3 but it is just because of my taste. I knew coming in that they only had black beans instead of Greasy refried beans and at the same time the enchiladas while tasty are not what I call the typical just cheese enchiladas with red sauce. I don't know, they have this other stuff on them. They also got bonus points because there was some kids selling candy in here and after we mentioned it to the waitress she must have told the manager who came over and apologized. Sitting on the patio was really neat. People walking by And just great to be here."}
{"text":"2 Stars are for our server who was very good, and the table side guac.  After this everything else was 1 or no stars.  I actually felt bad for our server.  I ordered the Arizona burrito with no toppings.  When our food was brought to the table I was brought the wrong food.  When my food arrived it was not prepared as ordered.  I just couldn't send it back there was no telling what I would have gotten

The skulls painted on the walls don't are rather unappealing.  Not worth the trip"}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere on the patio and excellent food. We just wanted a light bite so we ordered a half dozen different tacos and some pico de gallo with shrimp and avocado. (not sure what it was called?) We loved every bit of it. The service was great. Friendly and walked us through the menu. I highly recommend Barrio Queen! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good especially the pork chilli verde and the grilled shrimp tacos. You are able to choose different style tacos which is awesome as well. Their burritos are huge! I'd say one could feed 2 people!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is the sister restaurant of their original more intimate 16th Street location in Phoenix. It's harder to retain quality in a restaurant probably 5 times larger than their original location but Barrio pulls it off. 

The food is expertly prepared with lots of very fresh ingredients. If you have a few days in the Scottsdale Old Town neighborhood, Barrio Queen should be on your short list."}
{"text":"Hostesses are so very rude. Too busy flirting with people and putting lotion on. Really? Would love to say the food was great, was turned off after a 35 minute wait dealing with rude hostesses."}
{"text":"A Favorite! 
Nothing to complain about!
Awesome atmosphere
Stellar service
Fabulous food"}
{"text":"The three star rating here, I have to say, is a goddamn shame.  Barrio Queen is a classy joint with good food, nice service and a great location.  When I went, it was newly opened and it took awhile to get our food, but our waitress was never anything but incredibly nice.

I ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla and it was delicious.  I also had an al pastor taco on the side.  

Straight up, you're in Old Town Scottsdale and you just got done looking at really lame art made by some old lady and she's telling you that it's authentic Mexican American or whatever the fuck.  Uh-oh, is your tummy rumbling?  I think so, bud.  Tell that old lady to shut her trap and come here.  You'll thank me.  Not in person, probably, but you'll go, \"Fuckin'-A, Billy was right.  The al pastor is good enough to murder for.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I are mega Mexican food fans. While Barrio Queen seems a bit more Americanized and not as authentic, it is still wonderful and muy delicioso. We have come to this location several times and will keep coming back for not only the food, but the excellent service. Tonight our bar tenders, Daniel and Thomas, were attentive and friendly even though the house was packed and there was much to do. We never had to wait long for anything or ask twice for it. Definitely try the guacamole- it has pomegranate seeds in it and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful and pricy.  I honestly would never recommend as the food is worse than Mexican TV dinners and service, well there is no service!  Keep driving and pass this over priced, poor customer service and \"food\" up!"}
{"text":"Went tonight asked for outside table was told 30 min. We waited an hr an 10 min. Then the manager takes us to an inside table where the noise level is beyond being able to talk.  I said are you kidding me after waiting double the time your hostess told us and you're seating us inside.  NO THANK YOU so frustrated.  Your food is good but not that good not worth the aggravation.  Train your people and your manager is worthless."}
{"text":"I knew that going to a new restaurant on opening day would have some hiccups in service and possibly food preparation. That said we decided to try Barrio Queen for lunch today.
The idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea for a lunch on a sunny afternoon
While ordering it was evident that the woman taking our order was very unfamiliar with the extensive menu.  No problem! We persevered and slowly went through the menu items and got the order placed. The server was very friendly and apologetic for the time it took. this was not a big deal.  It was time to pay and off to our table we went to await the fantastic sounding food we ordered. 
W ordered 4 tacos 1 salmon y Mango, 1 Chorizo, 1 Barrio Pollo and 1 arrachera y relleno.  We also ordered what we believed what we believed would be the star of the day, The masa azul quesadilla with Huitlacoche \" the mexican truffle\" . 
The 4 tacos arrived and where each truly unique and different. I also didn't get the same plate representation that DAVID L. posted and didn't get side dishes of sauces. (I know HICCUPS) While they were delicious the arrachera y relleno seemed to have lost its relleno.  Oh well opening day hiccups, not something to worry about as it was still very good. 
Then came the Huitlacoche quesadilla. We have had huitlacoche a few times and really like its flavor.

The menu describes the quesadilla as served with quesillo cheese, sautéed onions, roasted pepper mix and of course huitlacoche.

When it arrived at our table the server identified it as a quesadilla champinon.  We asked her about the huitloche and she corrected herself and said thats what we had and she misspoke. Upon examination what we had was a quesadilla containing cheese, sautéed onions and button mushrooms. No sign of the pepper mix or the Huitlacoche.  
My husband returned it to the window and the woman was very sorry and said she would get us what we ordered.  She took the quesadilla.  A few minutes later she came to the table and said what we had was huitlache.  When we disagreed she offered to get the manager.  
The manager came to our table and he told us what we had was huitlacoche.  My husband told him we knew what huitlacoche was and that it was grown on corn and was a purplish black color and that our quesadilla was only onions, mushrooms and cheese. No huitlacoche or anything that resembled it.  His only reply was that is what huitlacoche is.  
He then said he wouldn't charge us for it.  Nice since we had already paid! he then said he would get it taken care of.  We finished our margaritas and left never seeing him, our $8.00 or our incorrect quesadilla again.  
Based on the quality and taste of the tacos I would be glad to recommend this place, however after the conversation with the manager I can not return.  He was confrontational and actually insisted we had something that we clearly did not and implied we just didn't know what we were talking about.  Since the server had taken the quesadilla we had nothing to show him.  As far as I am concerned that management mentality will not work its way out the like the service hiccups probably will."}
{"text":"The is such a fun place to eat. The decor is very trendy and the service is excellent. The food is very good and menu is pretty big. However the parking is terrible. Good luck finding a spot!"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant week menu. Everything was good, not great.   Noise level was extremely high.  However, what made our dining experience so enjoyable was our server, Angel. He was attentive, efficient and extremely personable.  His vibrant personality carried the evening."}
{"text":"This is me and my boyfriends FAVORITE place for micheladas and tacos. We have been to Barrio Queen about 6 times, and we always get the same thing (choose 3 tacos for $11 and they are AMAZING). The service is always ok, not bad, but not the best I've had. Well let me tell you, that changed today. We were sat outside in Dustin's section and he quickly greeted us making sure the sun was out of our eyes by moving the umbrellas for us. Shortly after we received our favorite beers and I must say the best guacamole we have had at Barrio Queen yet, what's his secret?! I never venture outside the tacos, but Dustin convinced me I needed to try the Arizona burrito, and I trusted him, so I did. HOLY COW! Why haven't I been getting that the whole time? I've worked at and eaten at a lot of Mexican food restaurants, and the green chili here is hands down my favorite! Overall this is a great place, but if you want your experience heightened, I'd definitely ask for Dustin!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned restaurant to take your out of town guests! Visited this beautiful location on a Saturday night with a large party of 9. There was something on the menu for everyone and the food was delicious and plentiful. Not to mention reasonably priced. Where else can you get 3 tacos for $10 in downtown Scottsdale?! 
Several of us chose 3 different tacos off their long list of options, other chose one of the burritos or a salad. No one was disappointed. Don't forget to order the house specialty, guacamole made table side! 

My only complaint was they seated us right by the front door and we all felt the summer heat without a breath of air. Watch where your seated and enjoy this jewel of Arizona."}
{"text":"We went to BQ for the first time last night for a MNO and the food was horrible! So sad we wasted our time and $$ there when there are so many options and even food trucks outside!! I got three different tacos, the shrimp taco had ONE shrimp, fish taco had no flavor and one with Carne as asada and chorizo was a bunch of burnt meat... I couldn't even... so unfortunate, definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"The service is one star and the food is three star. So I compromised with 2 stars. Seriously... I think they're standing outside going \"hey you wanna work tonight?\" To people passing by to see what hits. Do they HAVE training? A manager? Any kind of quality control? 

My daughter in law said she had mentioned we were going here and her co worker warned her the service was horrible. They were right. 

Therefore... The food is good but absolutely not worth putting up with such bad service."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food + Sugar Skull makeup = super fun night.

This was my first time and Barrio Queen and I'm addicted. I was able to enjoy this great October night out on their patio in Old Town Scottsdale. Tonight was a Day of the Dead theme party which they will also have on Nov 1st and Nov 2nd (2014) with live music and face painting for a fun and festive celebration.

Food was Ah-mazing. Mainly I am speaking of the tacos and churros. The chips were tasty and the guacamole was okay, it wasn't bad, but I felt like there were a lot of other ingredients mixed in that it became hard to taste the avocados. Another appetizer, the Vasito de Elote, consisted of grilled corn kernels that are severed in a cup, topped with butter, mayo, cotija cheese, Valentina hot sauce, cilantro, and lime was good, but anything topped with butter is better.  I also sampled the Ceviche Salad, which wasn't my cup of tea, but that rarely is so don't let my opinion skew yours. Okay so onto the tacos, I tried the Al Pastor (marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, fresh pineapple, and red salsa) and the Huitlacoche y Champinon which is packed with mushrooms, shallots and garlic topped with pico de gallo. Both were so good and I love mushrooms and am still salivating over these tacosl - so flipping good. Oh and the churros? Not only are they fried and rolled in cinnamon and sugar to perfection, but THEY ARE STUFFED WITH CARAMEL (or maybe it was butterscotch, I couldn't tell, but it didn't really matter! 

Being that this is a Tequileria, I had to try a couple of their margaritas even though tequila isn't my favorite (mainly I have to say \"bye\" to whoever I am with because my autopilot gets switched on). I ended up trying the Limon y Coco Margarita first since it is a coconut flavored tequila and it could ease me in - man was it tasty. I love pina coldas and thus reminded me of that, but melted, and not as sweet, I wanted another to order another one, but also I went for something else. That being their Casa Margarita which was still flavorful compared to other restaurant house margs I have tried and I recommend it along with the Limon y Coco. 

The service here is wonderful and I would come back just for that reason. Staff is friendly, fast, and efficient. Something that I don't take for granted. 

The bummer is that they do not take reservations and with the size of the restaurant you may have to wait awhile for a table if you come during prime time hours. Also, for what I am used to with Mexican food, these prices seem a bit higher. On the plus they do have great specials if you are able to catch them. I will be back"}
{"text":"Tara D. was our server for a huge group 35 plus people.  Excellent customer service and made great suggestions for happy hour items and the Tequila Flight.  The Puerco Verde Cup was a very tasty happy hour item."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my favorite bar to go to! The best part about it is Anthony! He is a great bar tender and is always attentive! He makes us laugh and is sure we have a great time! Keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Had dinner tonight here... I had the Queso De Cabra salad.  Our attentive and super friendly waitress, Sherrie, suggested adding the grilled chicken and avocado and it was so fresh and yummy!  Great suggestion, Sherrie! My husband had the Torta De Cochinita Pibil and it was also really fresh and delicious.    Loved the happy hour drink and appetizers, too!  We'll be back a lot."}
{"text":"If you enjoy the flavors of Mexican food this is not it! Salsa was bland, asked for a spicy one and that had a good flavor but still not spicy. My friend requested a carne asasda burrito which was dry and was mostly rice. No flavor what so ever . We will not be back, music was good"}
{"text":"After eating here 5 or 6 times, each time hoping the food will be good I have decided it it just uninspired. There is nothing here to bring me back. The atmosphere is nice, service attentive (even if my current server is robotic) but the food is just not what it should be. Too bad we need a really good Mex in this area."}
{"text":"The house margarita (aka Casa Margarita) is terrible! If this is their attempt at up-selling, it works. Because next time I go back, I'll order one of their premium margaritas. And yes, I'll go back because everything else is really good; the food, the service, the music, and the chotchkies. (How do you say that in Spanish?) Secret Tip: There's always a bunch of people waiting by the front door for dinner because they don't take reservations. So when you're done at the hostess stand, go to the room on the right because there's another bar back there that isn't as busy as the main bar. Go back there and order your drink then, and here's the secret part, there's another patio off that room which hardly anyone knows about. Hang out there while you're waiting for your table and make out with your date on one of the couches. Tell her you own the place and this is your private patio! The cell phone app tells you your place in line and notifies you when your table is ready. Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"Our burritos were bomb (we both had the Carne Asada burritos) !!! I judge a restaurant first and foremost by the delivery of their chips & salsa though. The chips are extremely fried and the salsa is fairly bland with no spice. The tacos are also street tacos, which are good, but overpriced for their size. Overall, the food has mainly been delicious so they certainly deserve 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Tacos, tacos, tacos!!!! They are absolutely delicious! I've been on a taco binge for 2 months now and try to find more spots to hit up for some stellar tacos... Barrio Queen is by far the #1 at this point in my taco hunting career!! I'll be heading to the Gilbert location tonight for some $2.50 TT !! Chips are certainly authentic to Barrio Queen as you can tell they were crisp, fresh and made in house. Order the tacos!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very hippy Mexican restaurant in downtown Scottsdale, the food is excellent the service was good. It's a great place to stop while shopping or browsing the arts. I had he carne asada torta served w fries and cold slaw very good, you also get complementary chips and dip. It's a little noises for table conversation lots of repeating but overall not bad experience. Full bar and patio during nice months, the staff is great very attentive"}
{"text":"So here's the good:  We sat at the bar while we waited and our bartender was great and so were the drinks.  I ordered the Pepino Loco and El Tamarindo.  Both excellent and jalapeno infused tequila has a nice kick.  The restaurant and bar were active and a very good vibe and ambiance.  The homemade corn chips are prefect.  The salsa is very good too even though it's not spicy it has very good flavor.  I ordered the Camarones Al Mojo De Ajo which I found delicious.  They have plenty of seating indoors and outdoors with misters on hot days.  The dulce de leche creme brulee is deliciously rich!  The cajeta...ooooh so good.

The bad:  When we arrived we were told there was a 25 min. wait and asked to give our phone number and we would receive a text when our table was ready.  No big deal, we'd go to the bar and order drinks but over 35 min. in and still no text we check with the hostess and realize she had the wrong number.  :/   While the camarones (shrimp) were delicious, I thought the calabazitas were undercooked and so was the rice.  It was our first time at the restaurant so it took us a while to review the menu but our waiter never asked if we had any questions.  I felt hurried from the time we were seated.  It felt as if the waiter wanted to get us out of there to close up.  It was 10:15 pm when we were done eating on a Saturday and they close at 11 pm.  I felt rushed the whole time.  

So although my initial experience started off really well, it didn't end as well as it started.  I'd like to try more food options and I really enjoyed the drinks so I would definitely return but wouldn't hurry back.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"If you would like great tasting Mexican food with a side of attitude come here! My friend asked for rice and the waiter pretty much rolled his eyes and said Barrio Queen isn't Mexican American. Margaritas are Mexican American and it's on your menu! Aside from that the menu is unique and I like the modern decor."}
{"text":"Being a transplant from California Mexican food is my jam. I love it. So needless to say I was PUMPED to see this place was opening in Desert Ridge. Sandbar is also good in Desert Ridge. But this by far surpasses all my expectations the food was delish, the cocktails and Margs are on point. We have been back a couple times and every time is just as good as the last."}
{"text":"This is the most bland Mexican food I've had. Albondigas tasted like dinty moore beef stew. We also tried the Chile rellano y carne asada, Chile verde, pollo en cream verde, al pastor. Everything was meh."}
{"text":"Not worth the effort. Go anyplace but there. The chips and salsa are not provided when you sit down and come at a price. The tacos are below standard. I had a fish taco and it was so small as to be ridiculous. My hubby had a pork taco and it was not worth eating, either."}
{"text":"I hear good things about the food here and couldn't wait to go with a group of family and friends for my sisters 30th birthday. First off they absolutely do not take reservations, this irritated me but I thought ohwell no big deal. Before we went I called and asked if we were ok to bring our own cake to sing and celebrate for my sister.. This is where I'm annoyed and give this restaurant 1 star so I call and they say \"yes sure but it will be a $5 charge per person.\" So let me get this straight, we are bringing a cake and you are charging me to cut it? I even asked if I could bring my own plates and cut it myself and they said if I did that it would be a $3 charge per person. This is just so dumb to me, there was 15 of us and i couldnt believe they wanted to charge us to bring our own cake! We ended up going and not taking a cake, food was ok. Nothing special, and we ended up spending over $300 dollars. Service was ok nothing great and I definitely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"The tacos were small, but tasty.
Chips and salsa good.
The burritos looked big and really good. I'll try one next time.
Helpful waitress.
The owner did a shot with some tourists next to me. They had a great time!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here and I absolutely love it! We came on a Sunday afternoon and it happens to be happy hour which is always a good thing. We had the house margs and they were amazing and cheap. I ordered the chicken enchiladas which had a nice twist and my boyfriend had 3 different tacos which he loved. Overall we recommend the enchiladas over the tacos. Also our waiter was super friendly and helpful with the menu! LOVE it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost on the weekend! I waited 40 min for a table that was available the entire time! Hostesses' rely on a computer system they don't know how to use, and they were rude! If the tacos were not so good I would ditch this place all together! No wonder it doesn't show up in the top 20 restaurants in the area. Step it up Bario! You used to be really friendly. Your owner would be discussed! Ditch the bad attitude greeters stat!"}
{"text":"So I am in town for some work and we decided to check out this new spot.  Since I am not from Phoenix, I can't really tell you where the heck Barrio Queen is, but I can tell you to come check it out!  

Tuesdays are Taco Tuesdays and all tacos are $2.50 each. Normally tacos are 3 for $10.00.  The beauty of Taco Tuesdays is that you can try several of the 12-15 types of taco on the cheap.  There were several tacos that I had never heard of in California, such as carne asada and fried egg, carne asada and chili relleno, chorizo and egg etc.  I had four of their fat street tacos: Carnitas, Fish, carne asada egg and carne asada chili relleno.  Every one of those tacos was delicious.  The meats were smokey and full of flavor.  The produce was fresh and gave a good crunch.  The egg was cooked a perfect medium so when you bit into it, the egg provided a creamy goodness over the carne asada.  Everything was so good, I really wished I had room to try some more tacos!

We also ordered the Churros which were too large crispy sticks covered in cinnamon and sugar served with ice cream and the most delectable caramel I have ever had.  The caramel was the real star here as it was thick with a deep caramel flavor.  Seriously, we even thought about licking the plate it was so good!
Sorry I forgot to take a photo of the churros!

Great service is a key ingredient in any five star review and the staff was top notch here.  Given it was very early and there was nobody there, but every staff member who walked past our table cleared plates, brought chips or checked on us.  Our server also brought everyone at the table small samples of the house fruit drinks to taste, what a nice surprise.

The house chips and salsa are also very good.  The chips are thick enough that they provide fantastic crunch but not hard enough to break your teeth.  

Overall we loved the experience here and I am really going to miss not having a Barrio Queen back in Sacramento.  If your here in AZ check em out!"}
{"text":"Tried the new Barrio Queen.  Great diverse menu of Mexican choices not found elsewhere with something for everyone.  Everything was excellent! Great happy hour specials.  The superb waitstaff were the real stars. Live music on a Thursday night made it perfect."}
{"text":"Best dining experience in a long time! Brought some out of town work peeps to Barrio Queen. First, our server (sorry didn't get her name- woman with cool faux hawk style hair and a great accent, she was training someone too) she was amazing! Eloquently described the menu and how different dishes are prepared, gave us a sample of the aqua Fresca which was to die for! The food was delicious, so flavorful. Table side guac was so good- wasn't sure if I'd like the pomegranate seed in there but the flavor all worked so well together. Great night, amazing service, thank you, thank you!!"}
{"text":"My fiance said I should write a review.    I replied that the restaurant didn't strike me as good or bad.  It was pretty middle of the road.

2.5 stars for me.

Service was fine.   No real complaints or compliments there.

Food.  During happy hour, you get 2 tacos for $3 Chef's choice of tacos.  And I delighted in eating the salmon taco.   

I was expecting grand things from the guacamole and was disappointed.   The dried cranberries were an interesting addition.  But I much prefer good ol' Trader Joe's guacamole.

Food was rico.   Rico means \"rich\" in Spanish and usually a compliment.   I just found the food rico in terms of calories.

I wouldn't mind going back but neither am I itching to return either."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Great patio, great atmosphere, and the service was phenomenal! Even the chips and salsa were top notch, which were complimentary. Our server Erik had great recommendations, which we took all of them. I had the Chiles En Nogada. After my first bite, I was already ready to give this restaurant 5 stars. It was a roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, apples, pears, dried apricots, golden raisins, walnuts, onions and garlic. Covered in an almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds. It was served with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies. The entrée was $22 but well worth it! They have tequila on a 50% off special daily from 2-6pm. I ordered one and the server suggested getting it \"sangrita\" style, which meant it came with 2 chasers to sip along w/the tequila. One was a house-made Bloody Mary mix, the other was a pineapple/jalapeño/ cilantro house-made mix. It added to the already amazing experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the worse service you could ever imagine. The bartender overcharged us when we asked him to fix it he said I can just give you another drink for free. Food took forever water not filled. Just didn't seem like they really cared"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night and loved it! The sangria was delicious. I got three different tacos and loved them all. Although they looked small they filled me up! Delicious combinations and unique tacos as well. My boyfriend got a burrito that he loved as well. Also, we loved the artistic qualities of the restaurant. Beautiful paintings on the wall. It had a great atmosphere. Overall excellent experience! Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what you get. Our waiter charged us 3.00 for chips and salsa but never told us it wasn't free. My sister's 2 tacos (for 7.00 and no sides) were so small they could be considered appetizers. My burrito for 11.00 was a decent size but does not come with any sides for that price.The service was okay but not great. I won't be rushing back there."}
{"text":"My first visit to Barrio Queen was enjoyable.  We went for Happy Hour and their appetizers were wonderful.  Tried two I had never tried before, both were very good.

The service wasn't great, had to keep calling the waiter back, but the food sort of made up for it. 

Atmosphere was typical for a Mexican restaurant.  Very casual and colorful.  Would definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican meal ever.  Only good thing was chips.  Salsa had no heat - at all.  Table side guacamole didn't have enough flavor.  I ordered a salad.  it was literally a pile of lettuce and some meat.  I was so disappointed.  Hilarious to me that OHSO bar's mexican salad knocks it out the park compared to what Barrio Queen had to offer. Other members of my party got tacos and were disappointed.  I would not return."}
{"text":"Really delicious and authentic Mexican eats. Had to go back several times because it was that good! They make fresh guacamole at your table and the pomegranate added Was a surprising and tasty touch."}
{"text":"In from Philadelphia, recommended by concierge. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. Food was great, one of the best burritos I've had.  Only here a week, but will definitely go back before our flight home."}
{"text":"Went to Bario Queen Monday night for dinner and margaritas and everything was perfect. We has a great server names Dani, that was on her game. Our drinks were up fast, and so was our food. I had a classic Margarita and my husband had a beer. This was only our second time going eating and drinking here but both times were excellent experiences. Maybe we'll make this our Monday night hang out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was very satisfied! Had the ceviche to start along with the complimentary chips and salsa. The house margarita was really good but on the sweeter side. I had The Queen enchiladas which were super tasty they had a rich creamy sauce and were paired with black beans and sautéed vegetables. My mom had the Al Pastor taco and Pescado taco both she really liked. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 6:30 on Tuesday night. The wait for 3 was 45 minutes but they said they would text us when our table was ready. We walked around desert ridge for a bit and headed back to the restaurant just in time to receive the text that our table was ready. We were seated back by the restrooms and there was an odd sewage like smell that didn't seem to dissipate but we attempted to ignore it. 
I can't really comment on the food because after about 10 minutes no one came to take our drink or food order. 
I did, however, get to peruse the menu. I've never seen basic Mexican food cost so much, even in nice restaurants in California. Why is guacamole $14 damn dollars?? Why are tacos $11?! Why are your rice and beans another $6 ($3 each) and not already included with the entrees?!?!
We ended up walking out since no one wanted to come ask if we even wanted drinks or food.
The place seems nice but for these prices, I expect so much more.

*Update: Julio from Barrio Queen reached out after reading my review. I was given a $25 gift card for my prior \"experience\" at the restaurant.
I did end up returning to Barrio Queen to give it another chance. Here were my findings...
Seating and service was almost immediate this time around, the only thing we didn't like was having more than one waitress. Anywhere between 2-3 people seemed to keep coming over and asking the same questions throughout our meal (which was a little annoying). But other than that, the ladies were very nice. 
The tacos, although somewhat flavorful, being street tacos (think the size of a small palm), DO NOT warrant the $14 (for 3) price tag. The rice, which was another $3 as I previously mentioned, was AWFUL. Absolutely dry and flavorless. Also, the rice portion was completely oversized (which I assume they use as an excuse to charge so much for the side). My daughter had gotten rice with her food as well and she also confirmed she hated it. Took one bite and pushed the rest away, as did I. 
We also got the enchiladas which also was nothing to write home about. Typical run of the mill enchiladas with an extremely high price tag. 
In summary, the only conclusion I can gather from this restaurant is that it's not the food which is causing them to charge so much...it's the way they decided to decorate the restaurant. Although very beautiful, more thought (and tons of money) went into making this place aesthetically pleasing and the menu seems to just have come as an afterthought but they need to somehow recoup the funds that went into the decor so they grossly overcharge for just OK Mexican food. 
Sorry, Barrio Queen, but if I'm going to choose between having a fantastic meal or just a great view, I'd rather go with the fantastic meal...which I can not get at your restaurant."}
{"text":"The tacos here were really good. I enjoyed the table side guacamole that was amazing. It's very colorful on the inside as well. Luis was nice and helpful to us while waiting on our table. The GM Josh was attentive to the customers in the restaurant and came by our table to see how things were during our meal."}
{"text":"Well, this was a fun after-work group dinner outing. We all wanted to sample the house made, table side made Guacamole. And, we were not disappointed. The portions were generous and the chips were fresh. They added pomegranate seeds, which was a whole new element of taste and texture. I was skeptical of this twist but liked it. 

Also, the drink menu was extensive and the barkeep was a tall pour. We certainly enjoyed the evening and I would recommend this joint to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I personally loved this place. Since we are in the Scottsdale area for a conference I wanted to try something authentic and native to the area. I'm so happy we chose this place. I had the 3 tacos for $10.50-ish. They were tiny but still so full of their delicious toppings and filled me up just fine along with the chips and salsa. They had a huge variety of taco flavors. I had the Cochinita Pabil (which they're supposed to be famous for), the Barrio Chorizo Pollo and the Carne Asada tacos. Loved each one of them for their unique, awesome flavor. I'm a huge fan of chorizo. 
My friends all got different things on the menu and were pretty pleased with their choices. I tried the menudo. It had good flavor. Was a little spicy, but otherwise good. 
The entrees are a little more pricy (around 20 bucks a plate) but there is plenty on the menu you can find for 12 bucks or under. 
My only gripe with the place in general is that there was no unlimited chips and salsa. Only the first serving is complementary for the table. We were a little bummed by this, especially since the salsa was fantastic in my opinion. 
Overall, great place. Loved it. Would love to come back if every in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Would love to take the time to say how appreciative I am of Chris Dillion! He's an amazing bartender that takes the time to understand my needs and take the best of care of me. I'm on a special diet and can't eat much gluten. He goes out of his way to get me cucumbers to dip in the salsa so I can still enjoy eating it!! Always is friendly and knows the menu like no other!! Every recommendation we have had from him is always great!! He kills the Skinny Anorexic Chola!!!! Also..... I need to say that Luke is also a great bartender. He's very nice and helpful. But I love the shit out of Chris lol ! Thanks Barrio for being a great place to dine, we love you!!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews for a number reasons, this is my first review...Is it unreasonable to be acknowledged after being seated for ten minutes especially during a non busy time? It seems that it behooves the waiters, and wait staff to speak to a customer and let them know someone will be there shortly and maybe get them a glass of water.  Is it because I have gray hair; or do they just lack the necessary social skills?  The wait staff seemed to be pre-occupied setting up tables instead interacting with their customers....needless to say I had a nice dinner at the restaurant next door.  I haven't the need to rant and rave, but I was very disappointed....."}
{"text":"I gotta ding this place a star.  The execution still isn't there.  It's been over a month now and they should have it down by now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food and extremely friendly service. My friend recommended that we go here for lunch and I am so glad she did. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has some of the best tacos in all of Phoenix. I give it three stars only because the service has been spotty at the new Desert Ridge location. The location in Old Town Scottsdale deserves 5 stars! If you're a foodie, you need to go eat at Barrio Queen! I recommend the tacos. My favorites are the Barrio Pollo, and a carne asada y huevo - this taco comes with a fried egg on top, people!! So good! I also love their rice. I don't have a picture here of the guacamole, but this guacamole will change your life! Make sure you get it with the pomegranates! The churros come with some sort of cream on the inside and are perfectly crispy on the outside with a softness inside. So delicious!! I've tried entrees as well, and I've liked everything I've ordered. My husband and I are truly regulars (we've probably eaten at Barrio Queen over 20 times), so we've experienced great service and poor service in different times (I am referring to Desert Ridge specifically). Desert Ridge wins for atmosphere. The patio is beautiful!! Service, however, is random. At one point, Desert Ridge location double charged my credit card (I caught it a few days later) and it took work to get the money back. Initially they asked me if I had my receipt, but I could describe our dishes, who our server was, and when we were there. I didn't get the money back for almost 2 weeks, and I wasn't compensated at all with an apology or voucher or anything. We still even paid for our meal from the night they messed up the charge. I had to call a total of 3 times to speak to the manager in the process. If the manager knew how much we visit Barrio Queen, I imagine it may have gone differently. We did get our money back, but it was a process, and I had to jump some hurdles to get there. Overall, the food is 5 stars. Service at Desert Ridge needs to improve."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Barrio Queen, I've had the chance to visit Barrio Cafe as well and I can't wait to be back. Authentic yet modern super tasty with a small kick! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area a year and this is my favorite restaurant here. I was drawn in by the decor and the atmosphere. It's casual and airy, but the skulls and artwork make it a little exciting. They are usually playing popular Latin music as well. 

I love the margaritas. They're expensive, but unique flavors and so good. 

Every food I've tried in my several visits is delicious. However, my favorite is the carne asada burrito.  The carne asada is well spiced and cooked just right every time. It's also available as tacos or as an entree and probably some other ways. 

Every time the waitstaff has been attentive and helpful and friendly. I've never had a complaint."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and both times have been disappointed in the service. They have great food (guacamole is not good though - lack of flavor for the hype and price!), but the service is poor. For example, bartender was too busy and she showed it...rude/snappy and was also arguing with other bartenders and yelling orders in front of us, she was clearly frustrated and it was unprofessional. There were many items that were forgotten or too busy to notice, had to remind about silverware (both visits), second rounds of drinks had to be requested after sitting empty for too long, chips/salsa, etc. First time we were there we waited way too long to even get a server. We will probably be back to give them another shot, because we love the food and the location/atmosphere is too good to give up on but so far we are sadly disappointed! I sincerely hope it improves."}
{"text":"We received the best customer service at Barrio Queen Restaurant tonight. Taylor, our server, provided 5 star quality service. He is very knowledgeable about the menu, provided suggestions on what to try, and was very attentive to our needs. Taylor was prompt with our order and ensured we were enjoying our experience. Thank you for hiring such a great person to represent your company so well. We will most definitely return for another delicious meal and excellent service. Great job Taylor."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Highly recommend the carne taco. I'm a huge fan"}
{"text":"We were warned by some friends who had been here several times and were disappointed but wanted to keep an open mind and give it a try. It looked like a great atmosphere from the outside. The bartender was unbelievably rude as he passed out group up several times while he cleaned glasses and put dish ware away trying to finish his shift. He then acted insulted when we asked for a pitcher of margaritas to which he said they didn't offer anymore. Despite having blenders in the background that were being cleaned off he also said they wouldn't blend the margaritas and looked at us like we were requesting something outrageous. We didn't care too much at this point as the margs were good and we were just waiting for a table. We then got escorted to our table and while walking through the restaurant we noticed cockroaches on the wall. Our group was a little uneasy about seeing these things run around and mentioned it to the waitress. Her response was that the door was open and there was nothing they could do about it! Sorry but I sit on a lot of patios in old town and other places don't have them running around and if they did it would be an issue they would address not just say sorry nothing we can do! She talked down to us at the table and said it was just something we had to deal with. After discussion we decided this was just infuriating and the manager came over to which we expressed our concerns. He apologized but still didn't seem too concerned with roaches in the restaurant. He offered us a gift card to come back and try it again which we will on a different day but it is disappointing we were told all this before and then it all actually happened."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I wait in the bathroom line.  The food and service were excellent!  However,  2 stalls in the ladies room is no bueno.  Any place that has a bar should have a minimum of 6 stalls in the ladies room. In addition,  please put a trash can by the door so I don't have to touch the handle with my clean,  bare hands.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We did the 3 tacos for $10. They are the small street tacos though.
I can't eat much in 1 sitting and I still didn't feel full after my food was gone.
The salsa brought out with chips before you meal is really good! The guac looked amazing also!

I would go back but would probably order something different. I love tacos but $10 is pretty steep for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Really poor customer service. My husband and I were told that the wait time to be seated was at 10 minutes. Twenty minutes and several empty tables later, my husband went to the hostess who admitted they forgot about us. We were finally seated and 10 minutes later, we were still waiting on a server. We left. No one has time for that."}
{"text":"After seeing the review and highlights of this restaurant
being featured on \"Check Please\" and being new to
Arizona we had to check this out as our out of town
family wanted Mexican Fare, we knew this was where
we wanted to experience it.
At 6pm the wait was 45 minutes, too cold to sit outside
and the dining area is smaller than you would think. We
had a drink at the bar, when the hostess finally told us
our table was ready she took us over, did not check on
if we paid bar tab, we had no idea. As we sat we were
excited about the experience were about to have, and
our first rude shock, a bartender abruptly came up to
our table to see why we did not pay our bar tab? This
embarrassed us all, not nice, like we were trying not
to pay? We went to the bar and settled the tab, 20
minutes later bartender came back to ask us to settle
tab now, we told her we did, not nice again, really?
Our server was not toasty warm either, no evidence
of management anywhere, bland boring table side
guacamole and luke warm food through each course,
experience was complicated and full of drama and
it is not why we came here to spend money to enjoy
a weeknight out, very disappointing and all five of
us agreed individually, it felt off, way off. After seeing
the food and hospitality on the TV show, this seemed
like a different and underwhelming experience. We
will not be fooled again."}
{"text":"Went to HH last night  Two couples  had two amazing appetizers and good salsa - ok chips.  The appetizers were the papas and the beef chile verde so yummy  had casa margaritas which were sparse  5 happy hour price is good but these were 4 sips and gone. Sweet waitress. Great atmosphere. Have been to other location and is nice to have one in Gilbert  HH was good but skip the margaritas unless you just want a sip. Nothing special about them for sure"}
{"text":"I was contacted by mgt asking for my phone and email address as they didn't want anyone to have a bad experience.
I expected to hear from someone once I provided my info as of today there has been no contact from them.  -0- stars for customer follow up."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen was one of those places that I ended up dining at on the spur of the moment. Usually when I go out with friends or a group of co workers I like to do some research and plan it out but then again spontaneous visits are too also fun. 

Originally the plan was was for my co workers and I to eat and drink at a rooftop venue that was within the same vicinity of Barrio Queen.  When we arrived there we were told that the food selection was limited and served more as a tapas style type of place. With the recommendation of Barrio Queen we all proceeded over to request our table of 12! The outside patio area is what caught our eye because the weather was beautiful and the scenery was great. 

Once we were seated, our waiter came over to take drink orders and recommended some of the \"best seller\" margaritas.. in the meantime they brought us out some pretty stale chips with salsa and after bringing it the servers attention a fresh batch were brought out. As an appetizer we ordered a couple of Queso dips and fresh guacamole. Both were awful and it was really disappointing.. 

Once the drinks arrived umm I was a bit disappointed to say the least by my watered down margarita that he recommended and began to wonder who actually voted this drink as a \"best seller\" because I beg to differ.. I don't think anybody really liked their drink that night and we weren't trying to be a difficult group so we just didn't order another round. With seafood in mind I ordered one of the recommended Shrimp dishes and that actually turned out pretty good. Overall the experience didn't leave me with a feeling of ever really wanting to return."}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague!  Both times we visited this spot we received horrible service and sub-par food...  Most recently we waited for over 40 minutes for our food to arrive and it when it finally showed up it was cold.  When I asked to speak to the Manager, he could of cared less.  Unfortunately, since the Gilbert restaurant scene has boomed, customer service and quality have gone out the window.  Customers have become numbers.  We will never go back to this spot and advise others to avoid if you have basic expectations of service and good food."}
{"text":"Homemade barrio guacamole with pomegranate seeds made at the table. Food overspices."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars but the drinks are spendy.   Not sure why people are saying the drinks are watered down.  If you like a traditional margarita from scratch that is what it tastes like.  The star is supposed to be the requila and it is.  I even added a shot of grand manier and it was awesome.   The tacos are like 3-4.50 each.  The steak taco's are incredible especially the one with the fried egg.  the staff was VERY friendly.  we were greeted with huge smiles by everyone.  Everyoen is friendly.   there is a queso dip that is not on the menu! I loved it my friend didn't and they even took it off th ebill becasue she didnt.  So service is excellent.  I will go back again for sure.  I already called a friend and said we need to go for happy hour.    Also there is 3!!!! pages of tequila there to add to your margarita or drink straight and there is even oen for $80.  I didnt try it.   I am not sure what the reviewer who spent 175 bucks ordered.  There were 3 of us for lunch and it was 32 after tip."}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this place would be good. They constantly have people so I figured it must be good but boy were we wrong. My wife ordered the posole and their was absolutely no flavor at all it tasted like water. I got the cochinita pibil torta, they give you a side of broth which you definitely need because this thing is super dry. Also i ordered a michelada which was just flat out gross. The only reason this place would even have a star is because the waiter was very nice and helpful. I would not recommend coming here ever"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends tonight. Had to wait 40 min for a table on a Thurs and another hour before we received our food. The tacos were cold and less than par and over priced. Seriously $11 for 3 cold carne asada tacos!!! Obviously the lease on this place is ridiculous to charge those kind of prices. The salsa was watered down and had little flavor. Don't even get me started on the service...let's just say bad, real bad. I wouldn't visit this place again if it was free."}
{"text":"Arrived at 19:00 on a Monday. 30 minute wait except outside seating which we took and it was fine. Guacamole made table side was tasty but preparation lacked flair
Enchiladas and Margaritas were very good. Service was just adequate."}
{"text":"Strong and tasty margaritas and a fantastic deal on tacos (3 for $10 with a variety of fillings), plus a fun Day of the Dead decor. The food isn't The Most Authentic Mexican Food Ever, so if you're in the market for that then I suggest heading down to Mexico for dinner. Otherwise if you want the delicious things I just described then come here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my family for dinner and had a mixed experience.  The restaurant, hostess, and our waiter were all excellent.  The table side guacamole was really good as was the chips and salsa, but as others have noted the salsa is very average and not hot at all.  My wife, son and I all got tacos and we tried several different versions.  As others have noted, the carne asada was dry and not seasoned at all.  The shrimp was good, but again, only 2 pieces per taco.  Our favorite was the chicken with the spicy rub, very tasty.  The happy-hour margaritas were good and though small, there was a lot of punch to them.  The price was a bit high especially when you consider neither my wife or my meal came with simple Mexican rice or beans of any sort.  I'd guess we'll return to try the other menu items, but probably not until we experience other options in this area of so many Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Had to try this place and I will definitely be going back! I got the Vasito de Elote which was just as good as on the Cobb!! It was an appetizer so the portion was prefect maybe 4oz.They make the guacamole at your table. It's different from how I make it smashed. They dice the avacado add everything and even pomegranate! Lime juice is freshly squeezed! I saw them at the bar squeezing it  for my micheladas, which was also good and only $4. Suizas enchilada- $15 The smell of them reminded me of my nanas homemade corn tortillas And the Tomatillo sauce on it was just the right spicy! I will def go again! All staff was nice and very helpful! We even bought a shot glass$3.50 and a T shirt$20."}
{"text":"Went here 3/4 days of our trip because it was so great. $4 happy hour margaritas and the best guacamole. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I would definitely recommend the Cochinitas Pibil, the Suardo Azteca, and Carne Asada Steak Huitalocoche y Champinion wre all very amazing tacos. Typically the deal is choose 3 tacos for $10; however since happy hour started at 2pm today, the happy hour deal included 2 for 1 pork tacos so I had 4 tacos today but they were mini sized. 

House margaritas were included in the happy hour specials so my friend and I enjoyed our margaritas with are street tacos galore. 

We also ordered tableside guacamole, which had a unique blend of jalenpenos, citrus, cilantro, lime, pomegranite, fig, and cotija cheese. However, this guacamole came out prepared and not made table side. We were confused by this since we saw a table close to us have their same table side guac actually made table side. We were disappointed by this.

Although our waitress was so friendly, we seldom saw her except when we first ordered and long after we had finished eating. I get that we were being lazy on a Friday enjoying margaritas and eating, but it would've been nice to see her a little more so we could at least get water refills. I had to ask one of the guys busing tables to get us water, but he only got one water for me and not for my friend. I just expected more for service when being on this side of town. 

On a plus side, the small but delicious churro dessert was excellent as recommended. Only 2 churros on an appetizer sized plate with 1 half cut strawberry drizzled with a sweet sauce come with this dessert, but it was a way to get a sweet tooth fix without being overly indulgent. 

My hubby and I got much better service with amazing food at their heart location Barrio Cafe, so I will most likely return there instead of here next time."}
{"text":"The jalapeno margarita is amazing....they were super busy on a weekend but service was great... Kristen was an amazing server.. she went above and beyond expectations..great job for such a busy place."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was awesome. The food was terrific. Chorizo on top of any taco takes it to the next level. Good drinks and beer select. Friendly bartenders. Great service. Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"The Guacamole with the pomegranate was really great! I would come there again just for that! I loved that they had 3 different veggie taco options! All were very good. I was stuffed when we left and will be back!"}
{"text":"A few of my co-workers and I decided to check out Barrio Queen this past Friday (11/1/13), and what a great find! We all started with the house margaritas and table-side guacamole. What I particularly loved was while they were making the table-side quac the server made us feel part of the process. Asking how spicy we wanted it and showing all of the ingredients as they were added. We did end up switching servers part-way through, but the same high energy service we received at the beginning was carried out through the entire dinner. My only suggestion (hence the 4 star opposed to the 5 star), is that once we had finished the first basket of tortilla chips we were not given a second. This was only an issue for the fact that there were 4 of us and half a bowl of guac left. We did end up receiving a second basket after we asked. Other then that the night was exceptional! Keep up the good work!

Unfortunately, I cannot remember our first server's name, but the second was Ronald. With this top notch service this restaurant will remain in business a long time."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio right in old town. Love the food and great service. You have to get the table side quac and queso"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The girl taking my order got the whole thing wrong... How hard is it to take an order that was so simple??... Also, Tacos barely had any flavor and were soggy... Overall bad experience and won't be back.. Too bad! Really wanted to like it as I'm new to the area."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint. We came on a Sat afternoon and did not have to wait. We were able to sit under the tree on the patio.
Our server Carlos was excellent. He was friendly, offered recommendations and made the experience very pleasant. I will ask for him again when I come back. 
The manager Amy was also cool and friendly and remembered our names and said bye when we left. 
Their menu is huge and the food was good. Chips and salsa were very tasty. We had the shrimp ceviche, was delicious and we had the street taco trio. Yummm... All were good, but I think the chicken with the caramelized onions was my favorite.
I would definitely return and bring friends and family. Great food, service and ambience. All the things I look for in a good restaurant."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant, I am loving trying all of the bars and restaurants in Gilbert. I'd read about this place and the reviews are kind of all over the place but I wanted to try it. I completely disagree with all of the low ratings. We tried the queso fundito as an appetizer and it was delicious! I had 3 tacos- chorizo (bomb!! My fave) for which I asked if I could have some potatoes with it. I got a huge side of spicy home-style potatoes that were incredible! I think they should steam them just a tad and throw them in with their chorizo tacos (chorizo y papas) with some caramelized onions...you'd never get me to leave. That being said, I'd throw those potatoes in a carne asada burrito too. Yum. I digress. My other two tacos were the carnitas which was delicious and the shrimp..also delicious.  Our server Tara was super attentive and friendly as were the bar staff and other wait staff. My husband also had tacos and my daughter had cheese enchiladas. We also loved the chips and salsa! Lastly, the decor and ambiance is simply fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Rough start but turned out well. The tableside guacamole is ok but I would never order it again. I'm from Texas so maybe I'm spoiled by our tableside guacamole? I asked for a spicier salsa than what they brought us waiter said they didn't have anything so he gave  me minced jalepenos (no heat!). I'm glad I asked someone else and they brought me something delicious and fiery! Husband's street tacos were ok (huge, selection though) and definitely on the smaller side (again, compared to what we get in Texas). My Carne Asada entree saved the meal - delicious! Covered in chorizo and served with veggies and black beans. Service was sufficient but confusing. Multiple people came by to take our drink and dinner orders multiple times."}
{"text":"We got to here at 530pm and waited an hour for a table for 3. The drinks were good, but the food was better. The portions are larger and it had real flavor. They didn't play it safe like some Mexican restaurants do and make bland food. I had the pollo en crema verde, super tasty and cheesy. The mole enchiladas were hearty. The AZ burrito had tender meat, but that one did lack a bit of salt. 
And our waiter was sweet, I was amused every time he walked by with his little cart to make fresh guac. He would snap on new gloves each time!  That's a new froufrou thing  but cute!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, for a girls night with two of my girlfriends. I have never felt so un comfortable in a bar, in my life. The blonde female bartender was extremely rude  and condescending. She almost wouldn't serve a friend and I our drinks because of a tiny crease in our id's (we're almost 30) it continued through our entire meal until a male bartender took over as we were closing our tab. The food was amazing but I will never come back due to the terrible service! This being a new restaurant, I hope they make sure to take time to express to their employees that making their customers feel welcome is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!"}
{"text":"I find myself doing lunch here at the Scottsdale location this week for the first time.  Have been to Barrio Cafe on 16th Street in Phx and had a wonderful experience.  Barrio Queen Scottsdale gets a wow/superb!  Guac may be the best I have ever had.  Tacos can't be beat.  Will be added to my regular rotation immediately!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my friend and I decided to try this place while we were in town. There was a 20-25 minute wait, despite there being several open tables inside and out, but we figured we'd just walk around the neighborhood.

They texted us about 20 minutes later. We were initially seated outside but being that it was still 93 degrees at 9pm, we asked to be moved inside. I ordered 3 street tacos with a side of rice and beans. Clearly, I didn't read that the rice and beans were an extra $3 EACH. I've never in my life heard of paying $6 for a side of rice and beans.

My 3 street tacos were $10, teeny tiny and lacked flavor. The camaron asado taco only had one, yes 1, undercooked shrimp in it that I couldn't even eat. The al pastor taco, which is usually my favorite, was flavorless and the meat was unevenly cut. It remained on my small plate. The carne asada taco also lacked flavor and had more toppings than meat. My friend ordered the carne asada salad and left about 80% of it on the plate. You would have thought that would have been an indication to our waiter that it wasn't good. We were tired and not in the mood to complain.

He came back to check on us once before dropping off our check. I was shocked he didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Being that everything else was subpar I'm sure we wouldn't have ordered anything anyway.

Needless to say, I was left thoroughly unimpressed especially after hearing how good the Mexican food was in the area. Besides the nice artwork and decor, this place left much to be desired. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Really great decor and a beautiful outdoor seating area with heating lamps. I had the chopped salad with shrimp and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good. A must have is the chili verde fries. Great green chili. The downfall is the prices.  The tacos ate really mini tacos for $4 a piece. Prob won't be back due to cost."}
{"text":"Over priced. $10 for 3 tacos and beans and rice extra?  Rice was bland, salsa had no flavor or heat.  My bill for 3 tacos, beans and rice and iced tea was $20!!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I truly anticipated that Barrio Queen would become one of my favorite restaurants upon walking in. Awesome decor and concept with the taco menu resembling a sushi menu where you mark off which you'd like to try. Then we met the waitress & it all went downhill from there... Just the thought of this place makes me sick now!

I ordered a martini & after tasting it, my entire table of avid tequila drinkers decided that there was tequila in it. No big deal, we'll just order another one, right?! Wrong. The waitress was so rude and sarcastic stating that there was NO tequila in it, in fact she made it herself. Okay? 

Ordered a round of tacos, they were fine. Nothing inspiring. Ordered tableside guac, they didn't make it tableside for us but they did for a nearby table. Chips WAY too greasy. We were still hungry so we ordered chicken enchiladas. They were cold, disgusting, and here's the kicker... I found a long dark hair right in the middle... VOM! We were clearly done at that point, and when we politely showed the waitress the hair she says, \"That's so weird, I don't think there's anyone who even works here with long dark hair...\" Hahahahaha! At a mexican restaurant?! *Cue 5 different employees walking by our table with long dark hair before we leave* Laughable. She didn't apologize or comp anything for us. Had she done that, I might have tried Barrio Queen again and given it a second chance but since the service was so incredibly poor and the food totally subpar I won't ever waste my time again! If you want amazing mexican food try La Hacienda at The Princess or The Mission."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot for dinner. They have a ton of yummy street tacos to choose from and other typical items you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant. But everything from the chips and salsa to the churros for desert was sooo good. They make their own chorizo in house and it is amazing. Also best churros I've ever had...a must try!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to visit Barrio Queen. I walked by it so many times and now that I've visited, I am kicking myself for the amount of time it took me to try it out! 

Barrio Queen was a pleasant surprise. This is definitely a higher end Mexican restaurant. It's not necessarily fancy but it's fancier then a divey Mexican food spot. You can get three tacos for around $10 and the tacos are delicious! They aren't your average tacos and there are about 12 different ones to choose from. The tacos are tiny but they are filling. We each had three tacos and then enjoyed the pork queso dip as an appetizer. We left just full enough without going into a food coma.  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere. They have two bars, with the one in the back being much larger. There are several tvs in the bar to allow sports fans to watch a game. I noticed several specials for happy hour pricing. I love their drinks, especially the punch and a margarita called Limon y Coco which is a delicious coconut pineapple juice. It's truly like drinking a vacation and all I need to do is sit on the patio with one of the drinks in my hand and I might as well be in Cabo! The punch was incredible and definitely a must-order if you like girly drinks. The patio comfortable and feels like you're in a big city and the interior is comfortable as well. 

This restaurant is definitely worth checking out to enjoy dinner and drinks. There's a reason it gets so crowded during the busy times of the year!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Barrio Queen has opened a location closer to home! I used to live in Old Town and Barrio Queen was one of our favorite date night spots. Now we have a new favorite up North to visit! I attended the launch party tonight and loved every minute! Walking in, you are immediately taken away from the hustle and bustle of desert ridge marketplace and enter this oasis filled with ambience and charm. A huge patio welcomes you with a large tree sweeping over the tables to make for a perfect al fresco setting. The inside is just as charming if not more. It's spacious and colorful, filled with plenty of tables, a large wrap around at with both indoor and outdoor seating and even a private tequila room perfect for entertaining a private party. 

The food. Oh the food. It doesn't get much better than the food at Barrio Queen! Whether it's the table side guacamole, the street tacos or one of their signature dishes, everything is excellent and the new location is no exception! The food was spot on and better with every bite. I personally love the street tacos and table side guacamole the best but I also love the enchiladas too. The staff was super friendly and I could tell the entire team has been a lot of work into making the launch, restaurant, experience, food and drinks excellent. They succeeded! I can't wait to visit again and again!"}
{"text":"After waiting 2 hours bc they don't take reservations (they told us it would be 1.5 hr wait and we got drinks down the street and came back)... we ordered immediately (party of 5). Server was not welcoming whatsoever and on top of it got my order wrong (twice). Two different entrees came out, both wrong. Food runner said \"well it's what he input\" - ugh do I care what he pinched in? It's not my order. 

Server then came back apologizing that he incorrectly input my order. Okay fine - we're all human. My food came out as the rest of my table finished. Bill came out, no comp? After waiting so long you'd think everything would be superb (not). My friends had tacos which were TINY. I mean miniature tacos. My shrimp entree was over seasoned and my fiancés carne asada entree was way too peppery. Blah. Don't go."}
{"text":"Sat and waited in a rather empty restaurant for 10 min before our friendly waiter appeared- still no chips n salsa!  Jalapeño margarita (a tiny bit high @ $11) lacked flavor and ZERO jalapeño!  Chips came, super super greasy!  Salsa (which I've heard was \"great\") was watery...   any way, our waiter gave what seemed like great suggestions, and if they tasted like they read, they woulda been good. But again, pretty flavorless!  We really wanted to like this place but SMH!!!  Oh well, we will stick with \"Joyride\" & \"Taco Guild\" in PHX proper!  Gilbert has a lot going on but none of the places here add up in quality to the Scottsdale or PHX locations flavor wise.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"Love the place. Good food good drinks and great service. Not a fan of the chips but I get that some like that type."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a recent date night and so glad we went as we live in the area and have been wanting to go but never made in in. I am so glad we did! My boyfriend had a really good burrito and I had the goat cheese enchiladas and we each had a tequila flight. We also started with chips and salsa that I wanted to drink it was so good! I cannot wait to go back soon in the near future. Service was also great!!!"}
{"text":"The Barrio Queen is Eh.  The have great outdoor seating and the indoor seating is kinda mid century modern with a twist.  I just kinda felt like the place needed a spring cleaning.  The table wasn't dirty but the RR and decore was kinda grunge. The salsa was great but the chips were greasy.  I had the pasole soup and it was really yummy.  The queso with chorizo was ok but really hard to eat. Our waiter didn't seem like he was super excited to be there, but was attentive.  With so many choices in Old Town I'll try something else."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place hits the spot every time! I love starting with their table side guacamole! I've had their tacos, quesadillas, and salads! I love them all! In Old Town you can sit right outside near the canal. Great location for day or night."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the best service we have had in a long time. The Al Pastor taco and the chorizo taco are the best!  The chips are made from flour tortillas and the combination of those and the salsa is so good you have to make sure you don't over eat before your tacos come. It's a little spendy but worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful but the service was a little spotty on the patio. Told us it was going to be a 15 min wait and then they seated us in 3. That was a good start, but would have been upset if we had gone somewhere else in our rush to eat that day. 

Was there for happy hour and got some tacos, the quesadilla, and a bunch of drinks. The $3 HH house margarita is solid, although they may try and up-sell you into a \"nicer\" one. If I wasn't there during HH I would have probably listened, but hard to justify the $5 more for a normal one. 

One of our tacos got switched out for another one. No biggie, it was delicious anyways, but would have been great to have what I ordered. 

Location on the patio is really nice. I don't know if I would ever want to sit inside unless it was summer."}
{"text":"Love the building, love the atmosphere, the decor is awesome and our waiter Zach was pretty chill. We went there for tacos and I probably won't go there again if I want tacos. 15 bucks for 4 street tacos. They were good tacos, but not four bucks a piece good. Their menu is pretty big and would definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Total joke. 15 -20 mins and not even hello,a water, or a bowl of chips. Saturday night. 9:00. Manger was busy taking care  other co-workers that had the night off handing them free shots and looking cool. Too bad. I've heard good things. Well first impressions are he best right? And they are at the bottom. North Scottsdale... should have kept it real in central phoenix. Please Upper
Management contact me."}
{"text":"My original review from 11/14/2012 
I was all hopped up on all the hype i read in the paper. and from reviews.
I was hoping to get blown away.....this is where expectation meets reality....

Food was just  \"okay \"

Our server was friendly and the place has a nice vibe .
Pollo a la Coco = nothing much to cluck about, though the burrito Erich ordered looked  great and he liked it - he also said he's had better .

The high-light  for him was the Menudo that he ordered, it was a large portion, and he liked it.
Marg's were decent as well .

For some this might be the cat's pajama's - sadly my  jammie's didn't even get damp.

So it get's a solid 3 stars from me.

nice place, nice service. I would still recommend it as a \"Decent place\" so as not to cloud the experience for others with \" o my gosh you gotta go \" -OR- \" don't waste your time\" 

Bottom line ?
It's \"okay\""}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would.
I love Mexican food.  It's always been a favorite.  So, I was SO happy when this location popped up.  YAY!  (Thank you to whatever powers that be!!!)  Because Desert Ridge was DYING for some truly good spots for lunch and dinner and there are some really tired concepts out there - you know the ones.   I won't bash but...Thank GOD Barrio Queen arrived.  Whew!    
Barrio Queen is fantastic.  Period.  The guacamole is amazing, the tacos are fantastic, the enchiladas are flipping delish (try the Suizas) and their margaritas are fabulous.  To anyone complaining, get a grip.  This place is PACKED ALLLLL THE TIME.  And for good reason.  Any new restaurant has kinks to work out and it's hard to do that when you're slammed non-stop.  But we have never once had an issue here.  Not once.  Ever.  Always a good meal, always a good time and we love the staff.  Carlos is dynamite. Great server and he knows his stuff.  
Can't wait to see you next time, Barrio Queen - you KNOW we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Geeze, I felt like I was back in Texas! So exciting. Love the atmosphere! 
So what's going to a restaurant without ordering guac and chips? Made table side (not sure what's so awe-inspiring about that but okay). Our server topped it with craisens... Weird. Never had guacamole with craisens. Nor did I like it- who's idea was that?! I took them out. Flavor wise, it was a little bland (I guess that's why they add craisens???). But I love avocados so I ate it. Huge complaint about the chips. Get a different style. They were so hard and thick that it was not pleasant. :( again, I like avocado, so I ate it.
I ordered their summer special salad which consisted of spinach, jicima, tomatoes, etc. Was pretty good. No complaints. Not like anything was wilted or soggy. Just a regular ol salad.
My friends were all about taco Tuesday- with 3 street tacos at $10. Albeit for street tacos, it's a bit pricey. But we're in \"Snotsdale\" afterall. Why other reviewers scoff at the price when they know Scottsdale is over-priced in everything, beyond me. Go to Glendale if you want 3 for $6. They looked tasty and the consensus was that there were in fact, tasty.

Barrios fooled me though. I decided to order the \"Skinny Chola\" margarita. It tasted great, but I am convinced that it's \"skinny\" because it's half the size of a regular margarita yet the same price. Well played Barrio Queen... well played.

While it was decent, the only time I'll come back is if friends decide to come here."}
{"text":"We like this new taco joint. It was fun and the food was good. Our gal was working out the kinks. We will stop in again. Great outside seating. In our hood."}
{"text":"Their Margaritas will make you smile from ear to ear! The enchiladas and corn appetizer were fantastic as well. Staff members are ALL so nice and willing to help you. Nice restaurant with a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had to ask twice to get a server to take a drink order while waiting for table. Seemed like it took forever to get the food after ordering. Although my food was ok no one else thought it was very good. The theme and marketing of establishment is well done. Unfortunately the food didn't live up to the marketing. Gave a 3 only because the waiter was competent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have sat at the bar each time. I am never greeted or acknowledged when I sit down. Always takes 5-10 minuets to get a drink, after I finally have to get the bartenders attention."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and the food is bland cant believe i wasted my time eating here. The bad comments are truly honest and you should listen to them. Wont go to this place again."}
{"text":"Sherri was amazing. She was so knowledgeable about the menu and such a sweetie. And the food was so delicious. Definitely our first of many trips!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place for several years my wife and I decided to try it for lunch.  First of all, it is much smaller than I had imagined.  As you enter there is a bar to the left with 5-6 stools and 3 booths.  To the right there are maybe 12-15 tables and a couple of booths and several high top tables in front of another bar.  It was too hot for us to consider eating outside but there looked to be maybe 8-10 tables on a patio.  The place is decorated in very kitschy Mexican, with lots of paintings of death masked people on the walls, etc.  The first thing we noticed was the enervating noise level.  It was so loud what with the music blaring, metal carts being rolled around, and other background noise we could barely hear each other across the table.  The acoustics are none existent.  The tables are right on top of one another, so there is no element of intimacy and you hear every word of what your dining neighbors are saying.  Unfortunately, we had a loud laughing guy right next to us who obnoxiously guffawed at everything his table mates said.  The extremely narrow tables are all set up so there is a chair on the outside and the inside seating is a continuous booth.  The tables are so close we had to slide ours to the side to let patrons at the adjoining table in and out and even then one old lady's big butt slammed into me so hard I thought she was falling on me.  Delightful way to start a meal.  The menu seemed interesting with a wide selection.  We passed on appetizers and my wife ordered the bacon wrapped hot dog while I ordered the Californian enchilada.  It is cheese filled for $10 but shrimp could be added for an extra $4.00.  I opted for the additional shrimp.  My mistake for not specifically asking how the shrimp was served.  When my plate arrived there were the three enchiladas with three small shrimp casually tossed on top of them.  Poor me, I had just assumed the shrimp would be placed INSIDE the enchiladas, chopped up and mixed with the cheese, as I've always had them before, not just adorning the top of the enchiladas.  $1.25 per shrimp seems a little pricey, even for Old Town Scottsdale.  Oh well, one is never too old to learn to ask specific questions.  The enchiladas were good, but nothing special; I'd rate them a 2 out of 5.  I've had much better at other Mexican restaurants.  My wife really liked her hot dog, which is a funny thing to have on a Mexican restaurant to begin with but she liked it.  As our meal was served I asked our waitress how much the chips and salsa cost, as we had not looked carefully at the appetizer section of the menu but had noticed the tables around as all had them.  She stated that there was no charge, but you had to ask for them to get them.  Oh, never had that happen before. Over all, I don't get the positive reviews and all the hype about this place.  This is obviously a trendy Scottsdale place du jour, but I wouldn't recommend you waste your time or money here.  BTW, service was good, water and tea glasses filled frequently and a nice waitress.  If you know anything about quality Mexican food there are dozens of better locations in and around Phoenix.  Don't jump on the bandwagon and go here.  I think its more for tourists who mostly experience Mexican food at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place is rad. Located rate in the heart of Scottsdale inside & out it is a beauty. We chose to sit inside because we had been at the baseball game all day in the heat. Altho the outdoor dining area looked super cute and comfortable. 

The inside is eclectic. Cool bar stools and lights. We had a group of 6 and we were promptly seated and the waiter came quickly. I ordered a moscow mule and it was great. Most of the table ordered burritos and they were HUGE. Extra $3.50 if you want rice and beans on the side of any dish. 

I ordered the grilled fish tacos. Oh Man. Four tacos was not enough! Haha! I could have eaten like four more! Note to self for next time! The \"Full Size\" Nachos is def. enough for a whole table to enjoy oooh and they had Pacifico in Bottles! All great things. 

I would def. return to Barrio next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Taco tuesdays? at a fancy place? well you had me at \"taco\". that's right...every tuesday, all day, is taco tuesday at Barrio Queen. and they have a requisite happy hour....3 dollar house margaritas (which are super tasty and flavorful and they don't taste like they're from a mix), and 5 dollar house wines and drafts. 

all their tacos are 2.50 on tuesdays. there are about 6 options for non-meat eaters, and about a dozen for the meat lovers. 

we got 4 each....one of the smoked salmon with mango, one of the \"fungus\" corn, one of the beer battered fish, and one of the cactus. my favorite was the fish, probably because it was fried. the \"fungus\" corn was also tasty and a close second place. the smoked salmon was my least favorite because the smokiness was very strong, but still good. 

service was wonderful...decor is wonderful. but just so you know before you go...the tacos are very, very small. they seemed even smaller than street size. still, the flavor was worth 2.50 considering a few other places have same sizes for not even a fraction of the taste."}
{"text":"Took advantage of some great weather today. Decided to dine at Barrio Queen which turned out to be the right decision. My dish was the Barrio Pollo Burrito with Chorizo added. Amazing flavor, this burrito is 100% the best thing on the menu! If you don't try it you're truly missing out."}
{"text":"came with a party of ~20 and they accommodated us (we had a reservation beforehand) very well. Awesome service by Fernando and Katie."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night with the family at Barrio Queen. Great ambiance, decor and food. Be sure to ask for Daniel K. He makes the best guacamole in town and gives great service. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dear heavenly father please make this obnoxious music go away while I try to enjoy my yummy tuesday tacos! The music is so loud & rapido for a 3pm lunch that I'm about to have an anxiety attack. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Barrio queen is amazing. I enjoyed it at least once a month when I was living out in Scottsdale and after I moved away it's one restaurant I can't stop thinking about. Enjoy at your own risk, it's so good if that once you have it, it might break your heart that you can't have it every night."}
{"text":"I almost missed out on the deliciousness this place has to offer - my teen didn't want to have Mexican food. I lucked out since there aren't many places open before 3PM in Old Town Scottsdale during the week and this was one of the few restaurants open at 1:30 PM. We started with the papas on the appetizer menu, at the recommendation of our server, we mixed the corn and pork - WOW!!! 

I had the 3 tacos for $10. You can mix your selections. I picked the grilled pescado, pork chili rellano and the barrio pollo. All were very good. The pork with the chili was a pleasant surprise as it was SPICY!!! I love spicy food and this did not disappoint but I was told that it is just the luck of the draw, because it all depends on the jalapeño they put on the taco. If you like spicy though, I highly recommend trying your luck.

My six year old ordered the hot dog off the kids menu, it came with choice of a side. She chose the rice and kept raving about it (this child doesn't like anything). 

The server was great. Yvette was very welcoming. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Highighly recommend The Queen enchiladas! They are delish! The beer and environment with the outdoor patio and vibe i really enjoyed myself! Hannah is by far the best bartender, excellent service, super funny and personable! Loved everything about my experience!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in Barrio Queen. The decor and service were great, but the food was not inspiring at all. I like the idea of the a-la-cart tacos. We tried many of them and the tacos were pretty decent. The entree, chicken mole was sooo bland. The mole was OK, but the chicken was overcooked and so boring. The drinks and the tequila selection are great. Unfortunately, the do not offer tequila flights, so you have to order them per shot."}
{"text":"Great dia de los muertos decor.  I am not a fan of TexMex food, this is the real deal.  Everything is made fresh and is tasty.  I love the original downtown where it earned the Barrio name, so it is hard to duplicate, but they did a great job and it is a wonderful addition to The Gilbert Historic District."}
{"text":"Finally made it here because the line was too long at Oreganos. Our waitress was very good. It took forever for the food to come out. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. I could come back, but there wasn't anything I was impressed with and there were four of us eating. Bartender was extremely slow mentally and literally."}
{"text":"Had the Cerviche de Cameron; the only taste was the kind that gets you to drink due to the heat, no real flavor, small portion; would not recommend. One TV at the bar was showing the 10pm News(!) the other one's signal was not working. New only lasts so long."}
{"text":"Get the pomegranate guac. Simply amazing, pretty sure I ate it all. Strong and delicious drinks, recommend the sangria. And the food was amazing as was the service. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am big fan of Barrio Cafe, the original and more upscale  restaurant in Phx, and typically less so of Barrio Queens. I've been to other Barrio and had low expectations. The service exceeded the one in Scottsdale. The quality and presentation was very good. Deserts were amazing! Ambiance is nice. I was pleased. Great service. Good quality."}
{"text":"Greeters were not particularly friendly when we walked in. Sat at bar. Bartender was very nice but obviously under staffed. Ordered wine & beer. White wine (Pinot Grigio) was so bad we sent it back. Ordered guacamole and chips. Guacamole was good and spicy. Ordered more chips which never arrived.  Couple next to us sent their side order of rice back, too. Would not return."}
{"text":"GREAT GUAC.  One of the best Ceviche I have tasted...but the hostesses are unprofessional and so unfriendly.  Management is weak...service is slow...I feel sorry for the waiters...they are nice people, but they seem understaffed.  In the long run they must be losing money since people can never get a waiter to reorder drinks...

Get it together guys and you have a great product to share and make lots of money...your waters are always so frustrated and overwhelmed...poor guys!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch last weekend, and it never disappoints! We've been to this location a few times, as well as the one in Gilbert. He pointed out that Barrio is really similar to The Mission as far as quality and taste, but way more affordable and I totally agree! 

I usually start with the house margarita, which is very good and reasonably priced for a cocktail. 

Then, (even though we didn't get it this time), we usually get their Barrio Guacamole - it is SO good. They usually put pomegranate seeds, cilantro, cotija cheese (I think lol), and some other stuff in it that makes it amazing. If you don't get the guacamole, they do give you chips & salsa when you're looking at the menu, and they're amazing, too. The salsa isn't too spicy, and super tasty, and the chips are way better than the ones that come in a bag. You can tell they're actual corn tortillas that have been cut up and fried. We usually eat the whole bowl before our food even comes haha.

As for tacos, every time I come, I pretty much get the same three - Camaron Asado, Pescado, and Pescado Asado. The fish is always really fresh and I love the queso fresco and Barrio aioli they serve on top. I should probably try something different since it all looks so good, but I love fish tacos and they have some of the best. :)"}
{"text":"Went this past Friday (10/13/2017) and it was a 2+ hour wait at 5:00 for a party of 2.  We elected to pass and come back Saturday figuring it was happy hour on Friday hence the long wait time.  Returned SATURDAY, 10/14/17 AT 4:00PM!!!!  I put this in ALL CAPS due to the time of day we arrived to make a point.  Walked up to the hostess station where there were (count em people) 8 girls standing there!  We asked for a table for 3 and were told it was a 45+ minute wait.  We decided to wait and took a stroll inside to take look around and see if we might be fortunate to find a seat in the \"bar area\" as we were told by one of the eight girls up front that the bar area is first come first serve.  We walked in to  see that there were no less than 12 open tables IN THE RESTAURANT!  There were more than half of these open tables over in the area right behind the bar inside.  Having never been there we stopped a server who seemed very irritated with us stopping him to ask if any of the open tables were considered \"bar seating\"?  We were informed that the only \"bar seating\" was at the actual bar! We walked outside only to find it confusing, could we sit on the patio outside the bar at the tables, are those only for seated patrons, were all the open tables only for those eating there and if so, why is it a 45+ minute wait when there were open tables everywhere?!?  PLEASE NOTE, YOU WILL SEE THESE SAME REFERENCES IN OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE.  You get informed of a long wait time, yet there are open tables all over the place?  Why have tables if you don't use them?  We then strolled back out the front door and saw the smaller patio on the side of the building with a sign that read you could sit there and get \"served\" drinks while you waited.  Okay, so we trotted over there to give that a try and as we started to walk through the gate a not so happy patron walked out and we asked him how the service was there and he said there was NO service and that most everyone was having to go walk up to the bar and serve themselves.  Okay so now we have a restaurant with a long wait time, people sitting outside waiting for tables, people waiting to get served for drinks on the little patio with the sign that says that they will be served and nothing is happening here to make us feel that the dining experience would be any better.  So it would seem they do not have the ability to provide timely service or food and purposely drag out wait times to stagger patrons so they do not get backed up all at the expense of paying customers.  I don't see how that is going to work here.  Based on the reviews to date, I see a issue with this place, no management and a crappy experience before you can even get to a table.  PASS!!!!!!!!!  We left and went to Carlos O'Briens at Norterra which was over 12 miles away, parked, went in and got served drinks, chips and salsa and had our orders for food taken and got to watch the start of the LA Dodgers baseball game then got our text that our table at Barrio Queen was ready after all that time.  We got a good laugh out of that and agreed that Barrio Queen is not worth the stress or hassle and keep in mind, we never even got a drink or food there."}
{"text":"Great chips and fish tacos. Really liked the check I. Procedure where you can leave your name and phone # and the monitor your place in line while walking doe the street for a drink while waiting."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow... We went late so thought lunch rush would be over. Zack served us and was nice enough. Probably under staffed. Outside patio and bathroom were dirty."}
{"text":"Super authentic. We ordered the tacos, 3 for $10. Can't go wrong with any combination. Also ordered the suiza enchiladas, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I grew up in AZ, lived in LA for many years, and now in the Bay Area. So I've had a lot of Mexican food. This was an all time best. The guacamole was exceptional, made table side with craisins. We also enjoyed the happy hour house margarita and stuffed poblano pepper. I had the conchinita for dinner. One of the best pork dishes I've ever had - tender and flavorful. My mom had an amazing camerones with vegetables entree. And my husband had three different kinds of tacos. The fish and vegetable were the best. And our server, Arturo, was awesome. Very tolerant of our small children and many demands."}
{"text":"The service is awful. We stopped in for lunch. After being seated it took about 5 minutes for the server came over and tell us that he had to go make guacamole and he would  be \"right back.\" About 10 minutes later his helper asked us if we wanted drinks. 5 minutes after that the server comes and doesn't even apologize but says \"do you know what you want?\" He takes our order. We had to ask for chips after sitting there for 20 minutes. We sit there for 30 minutes waiting for our 3 tacos to come. It was not busy at this time because it was 1:20 and the rush was over. Our waiter was nowhere in sight. No refills, just left us there. He checked on us once after the food arrived.  We had to eat fast so we could get back to work. The waiter was still  nowhere in sight so we had to go to the front to pay. The Manager on duty was there and when we inquired about why it took so long when there was no one in the restaurant she said \"well it was busy.\" All she did was make excuses. We paid our bill and left. The food was okay if you want to pay $10 for one avocado in your guacamole. I don't feel like I need to ever return. They did not seem to value my experience at all."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio on a Sunday afternoon watching the Ladies of Maricopa County in their impossibly high heels and very short skirts (how do they stride along like that????) stroll by was fun.  As for the rest---after wanting so badly to try the Barrio Queen and being thwarted countless times, all I can say is: what a disappointment,  Of the four of us, not a single diner at our table could find anything really positive to say. The Mexican food at Filiberto's is better and so is the service.  All I hear about is all the accolades the chef/owner has received----she must be juicing the judges up on margaritas.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Started with the Vasito de Elote. It was 3/5 okay. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, just decent. 

Moved on to have the carne asada y chile relleno taco and it was 4/5. The heat of the peppers sneak up on you but the flavor was fantastic. Only thing keeping it from a 5 is the tortillas are tiny so they can be difficult to eat. 

Their Barrio Pollo Burrito is the best chicken burrito I have ever had. 6 of 5. That sauce is incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. 

Finished with the tres leches. It was more fruit and whipped cream than tres leches. The bites of cake I had were tasty but skimped for their strawberry counterpart. 2/5. 

While the food came out reasonably quick, the service is at a more relaxed pace. That being said, I always had drink in my glass and my waiter made great recommendations and was very attentive. 4 staff members asked how things were and quickly rushed away plates. It was a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"A James Beard award for a Mexican restaurant?  Evidently Barrio Queen has one, and that can't always be a good thing when it ramps up the expectations.  Unless the expectations get crushed, then I just need to recalibrate.

Tuesday night in Scottsdale, and my hosts brought me here for a feed.  This is an extremely clean, decorative and exciting restaurant with a menu to match.  The table appetizer was a plate of nacho chips with a black bean dip, deep and rich in flavour.

We started with the guacamole, made tableside.  Big chunks of avocado with cilantro, jalapeño, lime, onion, tomato, this was not a green puree.  The unexpected was the dried cranberries added in for a tangy sweetness.  Sometimes they use pomegranate seeds-delicious!

For a main, I had the tacos, which was a tough decision since they are available in more than a dozen different variations.  I tried 4 different tacos as a sampler.  When they arrived, I thought they looked a bit small, sort of how a slider looks compared to a full burger.  But they filled me up just fine.  I could have ordered more at $3.50 a pop until I was as stuffed as I wanted to be. 

But there was dessert.  I ordered the Choco Flan, a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake with Mexican chocolate drizzled over the top, and finished with crushed pecans.  This was an amazing dish!

A big win!  Now I need to lay down and rest..."}
{"text":"Mediocre, esp for the price. Maybe I made a bad menu choice. The table side guac was \"ok\" but was way way too heavy on the onions even though we requested that they go light on them. The street tacos were also way heavy on the onions (I know street tacos have raw onions; but they shouldn't be overpowering). The homemade corn tortillas fell apart they were so soggy. I'm talking so soggy you couldn't even pick them up. The fillings were good but had to eat them with a fork and spoon. Margaritas: decent. Three of us dined with one drink each, a shared appetizer (the guac) and had meager main courses (the street tacos) and the bill including tip was over 110.00. Kinda steep for a meal where tacos that are that pathetic."}
{"text":"Food was just ok and service was horrible. Save your time and money and go somewhere else. We ordered guacamole when we sat down and it took over an hour to come out. All food was cold"}
{"text":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! 

The ambience is killer, the host staff is extremely friendly, wonderful patio in the perfect location...The menu looks (imagine this word italicized) deliciously appealing and even boasts how the chef was on some famous cooking show...so my question becomes even more desperate as to why..WHY is the food so terrible?? And by terrible I mean YUCK, EWW, \"Are you serious?!?\" terrible. From start to finish, everything was bad. 

We ordered an appetizer no onions...it came out seemingly floating in onions. Ok, no big deal, mistakes happen...Then we ordered 3 tacos each. So we're talking a 6-taco chance to pull together a decent taco...yet not a one passed. My mango in my salmon mango taco was literally green and hard (so under ripe I'm wondering how they even cut into it). The cactus in our cactus tacos was cold. The tortillas were also cold and couldn't possibly be any smaller. The fried fish taco tasted like lukewarm grease and frankly I can't recall the 3 remaining tacos we ordered because everything was so bland, meh, and unmemorable. 

The only reason this places gets any stars is again the ambience. Who knows? It might be an ok place to go for drinks (I probably won't bother finding out)..just DON'T ORDER ANY FOOD!"}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican when we arrived in Scottsdale. There were so many you options so we decided based on reviews. The service was great & everyone was super friendly. We ordered two brisket tacos & the pork nachos. The brisket was very tender, the corn tortilla was dry & got super soggy from the meat. The nachos left a lot to be desired. They were not flavorful, the cheese wasn't cheesy, the pork was not the typical carnita pork. We later had Mexican at our resort and it was exactly what we hoped Barrio Queen to be..."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh, table side guacamole! Fish tacos were outstanding! We went here on Cinco de Mayo and despite being PACKED around happy hour time, we received excellent service!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend the Tatum and the N101 location! This was my second time there. They don't take reservations which is a huge problem. Both times I went they tell everyone it's an hour wait. The hostesses are not friendly and the wait staff needs a lot more training. Our waiter was so rude. It took 20 minutes for him even to speak to us. The side table guacamole had no flavor and the rest of our food was horrible. To sum it up bad service from the minute to get the restaurant, bad food, expensive drinks and food. There are so many great Mexican restaurants is Phoenix don't waste your time or money on this restaurant until they figure out how to give even a little customer service instead of none at all!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come back and try the food which was excellent we sat at the bar and then I had the most delicious spicy margarita I've ever tasted. Seems like they really improved on the house margarita this is what we had last time so I think this place is going to do very well"}
{"text":"The food is so good!  There was a Mexican band playing on Saturday night, and the ambience was incredible.  We brought some out of town guests here and they really enjoyed it.  We highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Typically \"local\" chain restaurant are very good when they first open as the management had their eye on the ball and training their staff to their own expectation.  However, things goes down the drain as time goes on.  This is exactly what is happening to Barrio Queen in Gilbert.  This is our 3rd visits since opening and this time the street tacos are just too soggy to enjoy and overloaded with vegetables topping (cabbages) to the point I don't know what I am eating.  I love the concept still, but very disappointed with the food.  The place & atmosphere is still nice, great looking bar area & service is still good and very friendly.  So there is hope here, the management just need to pay attention to their food quality."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  I recommend the guacamole and the green chili burro.  Margaritas were OK, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat!! I've had authentic mexican food (I'm mexican so that's a given) but this place has its own flare to its food and I appreciate their efforts. Nothing beats moms home cooked food but when mom a.k.a. The wife is to tired I a nice to find a place like this to fill you up. Guacamole was made just right and right in front of you btw. The carnitas familia plate was more then I expected and very flavorful. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday for lunch. The entire experience was awkward and the service was terrible. Two of us ordered from the taco menu. When the tacos finally arrived the person who delivered them informed that one of the tacos (pork carnitas) which is one of their specialties was not available and that I needed to reorder with my server. By this time everyone in my party had their food. The server told us the kitchen did not inform her they were out of the carnitas. I reordered but 30 minutes later I still did not have my order and so we cancelled it. Took another 15 minutes to get the check. Very poor management! No teamwork! The server is the victim of poor management. The food that we did get was good. Several people were asking for their servers and two managers were running around trying to respond, but they were very disorganized!"}
{"text":"Krys was great! Food was great & she provided excellent service! Best chips, burritos, & salsa! Deff recommend this place to anyone that is looking for Mexican food with an authentic feel that is also delicious. This is one of my favorite places to go on the weekends"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant and I was excited to see it opening closer to where I live! Just sad that the food wasn't quite up to par. They did just recently open though so I'd give it another try. The people working here are really nice, the highlight of our night was watching a man dance as he was making tableside guacamole haha, it was awesome. 
First they bring out chips and salsa. Salsa was pretty good by the chips were pretty bland, not my fave. For my meal I got the three different vegetarian tacos with a side of black beans. My sister got veggie tacos and French fries. I didn't care for the cactus taco or the poblano pepper taco, just didn't have a very good flavor, insides kinda slimy. The last one, I forgot what it's called, was pretty yummy. The jalapeño on top adds a kick!  The beans tasted oddly soapy, I barely ate them. The fries were surprisingly the star of the show, they had the perfect amount of spice. They have discount tacos on taco Tuesday so the price was right! I think I will come back but now I know what not to order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Danny & Josh were awesome bartenders! Very knowledgeable and loved everything they recommended! The happy hour here was great to and atmosphere was very fun! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesdays, so I will not critique the service as I know it can be a mad house and the servers were busting their behinds.. I don't understand why they sell themselves and their guests short of a better meal by not using \"taco holders\" for lack of a better term. The tacos are served flat on the plate, and by the time they get to you they are soggy and fall apart as you try to pick them up. I ordered 4 Tacos and ate 3 with a fork and knife for this reason. However, this is my only gripe, and it's a shame since the tortillas are clearly home made. The content of said tacos was fantastic. The cochinita pibil was very authentic and juicy. The pork chile verde and nopalitos were very good as well. Overall I would be back."}
{"text":"I'm always a 'glass half full' kind of person and really wanted to love this place based on the ambiance.  I LOVE Mexican food and usually the chips and salsa experience is the first indicator of a good restaurant.  The chips were definitely homemade but felt like hard shells I make when frying Mission tortillas at home with an extra layer of grease.  Also felt their salsa was heavily tomatillo green based,which is OK, but lacked the Sonoran flavor. When my husband asked for a salsa with more 'heat' they brought out a 'habenero' salsa which he said was not even as hot as the normal salsa they brought in the first place.  We both ordered the trio tacos, but the 'shrimp tacos' came out as ONE deep fried dinky tasteless shrimp and the other taco was literally a 1\"x2\" piece of blackened flavorless fish. In addition, had to pay extra for a side of 'rice' which was basically white rice with a little yellow food coloring and a splash of canned corn thrown in for decoration. 
Our order was obviously screwed up as they thought we ordered a chunk of fish instead of shrimp, but didn't want to complain as another waitress already came out earlier with a platter that clearly wasn't ours.
I'd rather eat at a hole in the wall with no ambiance and great food than this place.  Buyer beware..."}
{"text":"First experience at barrio queen... A texmex spot that is trying to be a Mexican restaurants but is definitely not. There are flies every where to almost to the point I felt like I was at the zoo near the area where the animals shit. The food is bland and the guac is tasteless. If you are someone that likes bland food because you have IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome) this place is for you but if you want real tasty Mexican food don't ever go here."}
{"text":"I love the freshest of guacamole made by order at the table!! A little more spicier I'll say , but really good.  And the pork green chili,  delicious."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm not sure if I'm just an odd case but my family LOVES Barrio Queen and I just find it to be okay. The service is mediocre and I just can't jive with a place that can't throw a few flour tortillas on the grill for a chica if I'm not feeling corn but I know there are so many people who would probably smack me up for that statement. But I persist. They don't do anything for birthdays which is weird and I've tried a few other things besides tacos like their chicken burrito that's just meh and I'm no fan of the thicker corn chips they use. Salsa is meh. I do like their elote and I did have some enchiladas that had multiple cheeses in it like goat cheese and shredded cheese with spinach and added some shrimp to it and it was really good. Our server recommended it and she was on point. Until I'm impressed, I'd say a solid 3/5."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Very authentic and very good!  We had the guacamole (best I've had!), the Pablano Nogada, and three different tacos.  Perfect portion size - not oversized - and excellent flavor.  Ivette was our waitress - very upbeat and super friendly!  She made the experience that much better.  Don't miss this one!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a long list of tacos to choose from, I just had the enchiladas traditionales with carne asada with mole sauce and it was AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"The place is always packed and a long wait time.  However, one evening it wasn't as busy and the wait was about 15-20 minutes for the party of four.  The ambiance is good, but the food and the service were sub par for the price.  Really wanted to try a little bit of everything, but the prices were on the high side as the quantity/guality doesn't justify it and no sampler platter.  We ordered some cocktails and the $14 guacamole, thinking it must be the best guacamole in the world.  The drinks were sub par, bland, not much flavor to them.  Thinking a good cocktail should be amazing and hitting you with different tastes/spices/aromas.  As for the famous and most expensive guacamole we've ever tried.  The waiter brings a cart with the ingredients and makes the guacamole behind you or behind your table.  Not much of a show, which I'm assuming is how they justify the price.  Just an inconvenience for other people that are trying to walk by, plus he's a waiter, not a cook which made the taste ok, nothing exceptional...not worth the money.  The sonoran hot dog looked like a good item to order, but can't justify paying $8 for a hot dog meal.  So we all ordered some enchiladas and salads.  They tatested ok, nothing special or a special sauce that's made a difference.  My expectations were higher considering Cafe Rio or Juan Jaime's make some really good mexican food for about the same price, except the guac.  They must of took notes from chipotle when they priced the guac and gouged it even more.  :)"}
{"text":"I used to live around the corner from this place and would order the posole to go as often as I could. Now I've moved out of AZ and I can not find a place that even holds a candle to this place. Completely AMAZEBALLS"}
{"text":"Overpriced and over hyped.  Want authentic? Hit up Filibertos.  Better food.  

The kicker...i ordered street tacos and got meat in a crusty corn roll.  When I asked if there was cheese they said they don't come with  cheese.  What kind of taco doesn't come with cheese?!?  Madness.  So we're one and done.  So many Mexican food choices.  Save your money and go somewhere else or even Taco Bell - they put cheese on their tacos.

Not kid friendly at all either."}
{"text":"I held off giving my review because I was so DISAPPOINTED with my experience at Barrio Queen. We visited on a Monday night & it was my first time there. I liked my coconut margarita, but the House Margarita was awful. The chips were ok. Salsas were not spicy & tasted very bland. The food was mediocre. I tried a grilled shrimp & al pastor taco.  Shrimp was overdone & al pastor was greasy. The elotes appetizer was lukewarm & tasted like day old corn. My friend said her Sonoran dog was good, but nothing too exciting.  Service was spotty and just okay.  I like the patio though!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen)

She served me drinks during Happy Hour
And all heads turned cause it was Patron
In one bite of her dish I knew the rating and the name yeah
Ah they said I was the Yelper they wanted to tame

Barrio Queen
Now we're sharing the same drink
And Bo Bites I'll rate them number one
No more hunger on the run


Barrio Queen is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  I've heard many great things about their food and I was even here for the Yelp Elite event gathering.  Though I only reviewed the event itself; I had to come back to do my own review.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I came here after an art and wine gathering with some friends.  The wait for our seating wasn't too long and overall the place was popping!  On one side a full bar and the other another bar with dining area and patio.  The place we decorated with a Dia de Morte theme and old Mexican style setting.  

I shot for the House Margarita to start as my mates order some appetizers -- Barrio Guacamole; which is made right at your table.  Fresh avocado and pomegranite to your thick and chunky style guacamole is definitely a treat and delight in my book!  I would recommend everyone to start with it!   I was debating on a street taco since I had it during the Yelp Elite party and found it pretty darn tasty and street indeed.  However, I shot for the Torta with their signature dish Cochinita Pibil; their award winning banana leaf wrapped and slow cooked pork with sour orange, pickled onions, and pico de gallo.  This torta had some pop!  Warning! The green chili atop is extremely butt kicking hot.  Taste at your own risk!  Overall I think you can put the pulled pork in a torta or a tortilla cause it would have worked.  It was that just darn good and delicious!  

In the end, Barrio Queen was a hit and I would definitely welcome and recommend this gem anytime to anybody. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  excellent food. Can't beat the guacamole and Margaritas.  Nice area to walk around.  Taco assortment outstanding!  Bartender got us seated in packed restuarant and was fantastic."}
{"text":"Service Great! 
Athmosphere great!
Food..... not the greatest ,
Chips were greasy,
Salsa not too much flavor 
Chile relleno wasn't anaheim chile and wasn't battered 
Chile en nogada didnt have ground beef inside , big chunks of meat instead, needs more flavor
Change the chef!"}
{"text":"If I could give -1 star I would. The service on the patio was horrific. First off the server got our drink order and after that didn't return for about 25 minutes. I had to ask for salsa to go with my chips (isn't that common sense to just bring it with the meal?) anyways my water glass had a crack all the way down the side after after the waiter was informed he seemed to have forgotten my new water so I was sitting there drink less for about half my meal. We spent $10.75 for table side guacamole, it was horrible, it was one avocado, pico, and pomegranate seeds, then doused in like juice, the avocado was not mashed it was chunks... We could barley eat it. We ordered the 3 tacos for $10 and they were bite sized. The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place! There are plenty of places to eat in Scottsdale and this place doesn't appreciate your business!"}
{"text":"Tacos are small but delicious and the margaritas are awesome. Definitely recommend going during happy hour though because it can be a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, but the service is VERY slow. Not just food, but even top-ups on water, waiting to order and waiting for the bill."}
{"text":"Our food was room temperature and flavorless. Our poor kid was served tacos that had obviously sat under a heat lamp so it was completely dried out and the tortillas had turned hard. Service was extremely slow and our waiter apologized several times. We saw several tables complaining and we even saw a table walk out due to the bad service/food. I'm bummed since I was really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The restaurant is very modern and chic. Loved their table side guacamole, definitely add the pomegranate. The waiter Luis was very kind and made sure our water was filled at all times. The GM Josh was super friendly and made sure we were enjoying our lunch."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Barrio Queen for a while and was not disappointed when I came in for Taco Tuesday. I parked myself at the bar and ordered a Victoria (which is my favorite Mexican beer) and some guac to start.

The avocado in my guac was not mashed but was actually chunks of sliced avocado. I don't know how I feel about that but that did not stop me from finishing it off with the awesome chips accompanying.

Their list of tacos is vast and pretty cool. They're $3.50 each or three for $10 (they're $2.50 on Taco Tuesday) I had the Carne Asada, Pescado and the Suardo Azteca. All three were delicious by the Suardo Azteca was my favorite with Carne Asada, Chorizo and Bleu Cheese. AMAZING!

There were so many more tacos on the list that I wanted to try but after these three and the guac I was full. The bar was full and the bartenders were very busy but friendly. 

They also have burritos, enchiladas and tortas on the menu. So I have to come back and try other great looking stuff on the menu. But I definitely plan on being a regular on Taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"At 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, the wait at our usual Gilbert restaurant was 40 minutes. But since we had two small hungry children, we wandered down the street in search of an alternative.  And the happy result was that we found Barrio Queen!  

It was so difficult to choose from the many gourmet tacos, not to mention other unique dishes.  After nibbling on thick chips and wonderful salsa, we ordered guacamole made at the table.  This version had an unusual twist: dried cranberries.  It added another delicious layer of flavor to the avocado, onion, tomato, and cilantro mixture.  

My sister, niece, and I wanted to try many different things, so we opted for the 3 tacos for $10.  We all tried one Cochinita Pibil taco, a combo of pork marinated in orange and achiote paste. My sister added a grilled shrimp taco and a carnitas one.  I chose the Barrio Pollo, chicken, caramelized onions, and roasted poblano peppers in pinon cream sauce.  Delicious! My third taco was filled with tender beef brisket.  

I should have realized that was plenty, but went hog wild and added a side of Mexican corn.  (Thank goodness for take-home boxes.)  Our server was excellent and even put my last untouched soda in a take-home cup.   

Besides tacos, there are many entrees, all reasonably priced.  Barrio Queen has a full bar and also offers the usual line of sodas as well as many Mexican choices."}
{"text":"Definitely try the tableside Guacamole.  Authentic dishes, and FANTASTIC Margaritas.  I went with family,  then with my friends and then with work colleagues.  Consistently amazing."}
{"text":"The Barrio Queen in their new Gilbert location is open less than a week. There a a ton of black-shirted staff taking very efficient care of the patrons. The kitchen seems organized and quick on this \"Taco Tuesday\". There are still several pages of the menu that are \"coming soon\".

The Saudero Azteca taco is terrific, with tender, well seasoned brisket in a tender tortilla. The carnitas taco is a bit less tasty, but the salsa verde brings it up to snuff. The camaron taco is very tasty, with one very large shrimp in the cabbage and sauce. The pescado taco has a nice sized chunk of breaded, fried fish with cabbage and sauce. Eat it first, if you get several tacos, as it cools rapidly under the sauce. 

The Casa Margarita was pretty average, tasting a bit bitter. Upgrade to a different drink that doesn't use the Agavales silver tequila. 

I had the Buñelos for dessert. It was excellent, but big enough for two (or four)!

Bravo for a great example opening a new restaurant!  The staff was just attentive enough, without being obnoxious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The happy hour bar menu and drinks were very nice. The bartender made the \"rita\" for me on the tart side which is what I wanted. The shredded pork was fantastic. Very nice atmosphere. The servers seemed friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for a big party. Waited another 30 minutes for the food.  The food was okay but definitely not worth the wait.  La Parilla  Suiza is much better!"}
{"text":"Barrio is the best Mexican food in Phoenix...absolutely amazing. I don't think anywhere else comes close. 

This location is in downtown Gilbert, surrounded by numerous restaurants, shops, and parks. It looks like a typical Mexican cantina, but is not tacky and overdone like a lot of other places. The outdoor patio is great when the weather cooperates, and they have misters too. 

The server was extremely attentive and knew the menu well. She accommodated a few food allergies in our party, suggesting different dishes and modifications. She was friendly and very good at refilling drinks and chips.

The homemade chips are incredible. They have a perfect crunch, are salted appropriately, and don't taste greasy at all. The salsa had a great kick and every ingredient was very fresh.

The table side guacamole is a must. It was probably the best guacamole I've ever had. They add pomegranate seeds to it, which is very unique. The flavor from them were a great addition to this traditional Mexican appetizer.

Form my entree, I had the signature cochinita pibil. Twelve hour braised pork (huge portion), six homemade soft taco shells, and rice and beans. The best pork I've had, if not the best Mexican dish ever. The pork was so tender and spicy."}
{"text":"Unbelievable, simply put. This place, along with their other locations in the Valley, is absolutely the best Mexican food north of the border. The decor is a traditional Mexican cantina, yet a bit more refined. While it has the great Mexican theme, it's not tacky and overdone like a lot of places. The waitress was very friendly, and the service was prompt. She did a great job of refilling waters and chips.

The homemade chips and salsa are to die for. I could literally order just four bowls of it and be satisfied. The homemade chips have a great crisp and are light and airy. The salsa has a great kick with tons of fresh ingredients.

I was feeling like a salad, which was excellent. Tortilla strips, beans, corn, house carbs asada, greens, and goat cheese. One of the best salads I've ever had. Others had the tacos, which were probably the best tacos they've ever had. The quality of ingredients is great at this place, especially the meats and veggies.

Overall, I can see why this is one of the most popular places for Mexican food in all of Phoenix. The Scottsdale location is great if you don't want to go to the original in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I visited Barrio Queen for the first time.  The service provided by Eric, Andrew and Desi was outstanding.  The food also was good.  I recommend visiting Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Some different dishes. Our favorite is the guacamole that is made to order at your table. Overall, we haven't loved the food and we've been in a couple times. Also, probably the most expensive restaurant in the heritage district."}
{"text":"Great service, awful food. Got the carnitas tacos, tortillas were very hard. Also got the guacamole which had no flavor. Margaritas were great and so were the waiters. But nothing near authentic Mexican food. Two stars for the service and margaritas but that's about it."}
{"text":"Barrio queen is great. My family and I ate there the other day. We had great service and loved the decor inside. 

Since we liked it so much I had them cater a training that I was facilitating and again their food tasted amazing. We had enchiladas and a taco bar. I am looking forward to our next outing there and having them cater for us again."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner tonight! The unique flavors of this Southern Mexico inspired cuisine really hit the spot. Bursting with flavors from the Table-side guacamole topped with cranberries, to the Carne Asada, and the sweet ending of the Mexican bread pudding! Norma our waitress of the night was very friendly, great smile, and knew the menu like a pro! Her suggestions, and the customer service will have us coming back for more. Thank you Norma - see you soon!"}
{"text":"High concept Mexican spot where the focus in on design more than the food. Guacamole was bland and the Pibil tasted like cardboard. There may be good things on the menu but we did not order them. Other people seemed to be enjoying themselves but it was not for me."}
{"text":"Came here for a light dinner around 9pm on a Saturday. We were seated right away, and our waiter was very attentive. I had the white sangria which started out tasting very sweet but was still very strong. The chips they brought out were great, crispy and salty with just a touch of grease. The salsa on the other hand was rather bland. I started with the elote appetizer which came off the cob which I loved, but the hot sauce was a little strong compared to the cayenne pepper to which I'm accustomed. I loved the selection of tacos and while the 3 for $10 price tag is steep compared to any decent taco truck, I thought it was acceptable in a sit down restaurant. The al pastor was excellent but the pescado taco was a little plain. I would go back if I were in the area again and would be interested in trying their happy hour."}
{"text":"What a disappointment
Service was non existent
Everyone around us got chips and salsa but not us
Did't getting water til we were paying our check
Food was just ok, some was cold and the shrimp was undercooked so we won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great area in Old Town Scottsdale.  Loved the Gaucamole made tableside.  Tasty tacos- need to order a few of them small, but tasty!  I would go back in a Heartbeat......"}
{"text":"No disappointments from this new restaurant! The Arizona burrito has some of the best green chili pork I have ever had in the valley. We are all looking forward to going back for another meal there, service is great wait time not bad at all."}
{"text":"Nice variety of tacos, great specials on Tuesday, phenomenal guacamole."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. Between the reviews we had read and the recommendations from friends, we were really looking forward to eating here. What a bummer.  The service was the absolute worst part of the experience. I'm not sure if the waiter was new, or just didn't care, but he could have cared less about us being there. I normally tip well, but this was the first time I have EVER left a dining experience leaving no tip at all. There was a party of nine nearby and our waiter gave them all of his attention, heck it took me 15 minutes just to ask for our check. The food was decent, but the tacos were very small and all looked similar, so we couldn't figure out which one was which. Also, the kids hot dog meal came on a hoagie roll, WAY too big for a toddler to try to eat. And the fruit bowl was barely enough to cover the bottom of the bowl. I wish I could have rated this place higher, but I would be lying."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, hostess seemed disappointed people showed up."}
{"text":"Sorry, I can't recommend this place. The ambiance and presentation are good, but that's about all. The food was overpriced and yet smaller than kid size portion. 

The best thing here was the chips and guacamole they serve you before your meal...except by don't tell you it's $11 for a small bowl of tortilla chips. 

Save your money, go elsewhere. Unless you're fine with shelling out $50 for a few quarter size tortillas, a couple pieces of vegetables and a few tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Scottsdale,great location and ambiance cant wait to go back and try the other items on the menu,My only complaint would be the lack of complimentary Chips and salsa,that something I tend to expect at a mexican restaurant,But that aside highly recommended"}
{"text":"I like this place, but I don't love it.  Went here for dinner on Friday and we were sat on the patio right away which was unexpected.  Our server was very personable and timely; she even turned on the heater for us because I was a little chilly.  The margaritas were great, a perfect blend of ingredients and not too sweet.  The best part of the meal was the red menudo; I hadn't had a bowl for years and this was really great and spicy.  The tacos were itty bitty and a little dry, I would have liked some sort of sauces on them.  This place is overpriced in my opinion but I had a nice experience.  I would recommend coming here for drinks and apps only, you can find better entrees elsewhere."}
{"text":"With all the Mexican restaurants in the area, don't waste your time. It is that new modern Mexican garbage. Not a fan. Just keep it simple. No need to get fancy."}
{"text":"Really great food but poor staff female manager if that's what you want to call her was very rude and male manager at bar drinking how professional is that but if I was to go back it be for the food only!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of tacos.  I like that they have brisket, chorizo, and one with pineapple.  Heck they even toss an over-easy egg on a few of them.  Chips are good and the guacamole is served table side.  It's chunked guacamole so maybe not everyone's style.  

There a quite a few cervezas on tap and the patio is fairly large.  It's newly opened and the staff is mostly new, but they all seemed friendly."}
{"text":"I met some friends at this latest and greatest Barrio Queen location in Desert Ridge Marketplace last Thursday night... we met for drinks and dinner before heading over to see \"Bad Moms 2.\"  We had a blast but the company and the movie were the highlights of the night.

The food was satisfactory but the service was less than impressive... our waiter was not attentive at all, and the rest of the staff were too slammed to give our table much attention.  The food delivery team was confused and seemed flustered but somehow we all did receive our orders.  As you can see in the pics I shared, the food came out looking a bit sloppy, but it all tasted fine. 

One of my friends received a skunked glass of wine and it took major effort to send it back.  She finally did so, but it somehow still made it's way onto our bill.  

The atmosphere here is a highlight, and I'm hoping it was just an off night for our server... I'd go back, likely for margaritas + chips / guac, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.  Lo siento Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"This is a nice clean place and the service was excellent. The chips are thick and tasteless and the salsa is fresh but also has no taste and is very very mild.  The food is about the same. Very bland and not much taste. This type of Mexican food may appeal to older people and people who like very bland food."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a go. Hostesses act like they don't want to be there. Got seated right away. Sat down, looked at menu. 10 minutes went by. No waiter/waitress, not even water. Got up and walked out. Will never go back. What's the point?"}
{"text":"40 minute wait for a table of two is a real bummer to start out the evening.  The guacamole was good, but the excitement of having it made tableside was lacking here.  The tacos were tasty, but as other reviews said they are really tiny.  The Arizona burrito was really good with a nice heat in the green sauce.  The churros with caramel were yummy but could have used another couple on the plate to share.  The server was very nice, but busy so we felt a little neglected at times."}
{"text":"I'm very upset at the way my parents were treated here this weekend.  If you want to be racial discriminated and treated poorly this is your place to go. It's embarrassing to have them visit (from out of state) our home here in Phoenix  and be treated as though they're not good enough to get quality and timely service. You would think in this day and age that a black man and white woman would get the same respect as anyone else. To make matters worse no one bothered to apologize or even at least comp their meal. I cannot believe that my daughter will have to be prepared to face this kind of behavior. I will NEVER eat here in the future and hope no one else supports them either."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn about this place. I ordered the $14 stuffed poblano pepper entree but it was tiny (see picture). I did remove the cheese however. The $10 guacamole was delicious and freshly made (plus pomegranate seeds), but again, overpriced for the amount you get. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem paying for great food but the portions were just simply too small for the prices. The stuffed pepper was delicious but was gone in 3-4 bites. The chips and salsa were kind of bland, but the flavorful guacamole made up for it. I did love how fresh everything was. Restaurant was clean and had great decor. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, the bus boys were efficient and friendly, thus the reason why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 3. I will probably go back to try the tacos next time, but will not be in a big hurry to get there, and to be honest, wouldn't be upset if I never made it back there."}
{"text":"Finally after a couple of attempts we were able to go to this relatively new place in our neighborhood.  This place has a really nice atmosphere complete with a large bar, lounge area and even a table with a fire pit, which actually seems a bit misplaced in the back corner outdoors directly across from the Barnes and Noble entrance. 

We arrived with a 45 minute wait so sat in the lounge area.  We ordered drinks within about 5 minutes but did not receive them until we got to our table about 20-25 minutes later.  I understand he wait but to me 20-25 minutes on a beer and sangria is a little long.  

Finally the food.  We ordered.  I had the pizole which was flavorful but bland all at once.  It certainly needs more spice/peppers .  My wife had the 3 taco dinner with cod, chicken and brisket.  These were all excellent.  The lack of sides is a little odd so no rice, refried or black beans.  

This was a fairly small sample but enough to let us know it meets the mark in terms of nice atmosphere but not so much in terms of the food.  Tacos were solid but nothing to write home about and the pizole was very low spice level.  At many Mexican and Mexican themed restaurants they bring sides such as dried peppers, radish, cabbage, lime... none of that here.

I wish I could give 2.5 stars but since I cannot I will round up."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! The margarita was delicious and the happy hour snacks were pretty good too. 

Regular menu is a little expensive for my blood but maybe on a date night Id try something regular."}
{"text":"The Gilbert location is a new location for this restaurant. Disappointing to say the least. I have visited here on 4 occasions and all have been bad, bad service, bad food, bad salsa! Went there last night and ordered the tableside guacamole. Instead the server brought out a already prepared bowl. Although other tables were having it prepared at there table. Not a big deal, it wasn't bad. The other restaurant has a green salsa that is hotter. We asked for that, \"the chef didn't make any today\"( By the way that was response on the last three visits) OK? So let's order, I ordered the Pescado Vericuzano, A very good fish dish at the other location. I was brought the wrong fish.
Ok, no problem, I tried the Mango Sea bass, It was fish jerky. Water please? I finally got the server and told her this was not the dish I order. After recovering from the deer in headlights stare I asked for a manager. She was nice but neither had a clue of what I ordered or what was on my plate. The staff is new, I get it, but you might want to read the menu before you start your new career at the Barrio Queen. Finally got the dish I ordered, Same fish I had gotten before with the bite taken out of it, Mango salsa gone, some new sauce applied, of course it was still fish jerky but with a bite taken out of it. Ok, I am outta here. My wife order the Chicken and chorizo tacos, they were good. This place needs a lot of help from management. Needs servers who know how to serve, and consistency in their food preparation. The Barrio Queen is like life \" You never know what your going to get\" Stealing a phrase from Forrest. Skip this place until they get their act together."}
{"text":"I'm So sad, shrimp tacos literally had one medium-sized shrimp per taco. I was seriously disappointed. The margarita was small and served in a cocktail glass. Grossly overpriced for the amount food provided. Also waited 35 minutes for a table that had been opened the whole time we were waiting to be seated. One star for the nice waiter. 

* thank you for the offer Julio M. At BQ that is very kind of you but not necessary."}
{"text":"Terrible service and amazing food.  Hard to reconcile, but you shouldn't have to!  Our waiter forvot to put our orders in, took 20 minutes to bring our drinks and never put our food in!

Shockingly, everything started showing up when I asked him where our food was.  Refill on chips didnt happen till we asked three folks.

Without a decent waitstaff and management team, this place basically sucks.  They would be -5 stars if not for the food.

Unsolicited advice for management: start over.  You and your servers are not doing a good job nor are you focusing on the guest experience.  

I have not experienced a worse sit down experience in many years.  

Guess how many staff members apolopgized or made it right? 0

Guess how many managers asked how we were doing?  0!

Food was 8/10, service was below zero.  Beyond a shame. Get your act together or shut it down as the current experience dilutes your brand"}
{"text":"Great service, good drinks, and terrible food. After trying this place for a third time, I have to say I am yet again disappointed with the food at Barrio Queen. I don't think we'll be coming back here on our own free will. For the price, most of the food we have ordered here is sub-par. It's mostly under seasoned and I usually have to add salt to give it some flavor. Their tacos are not very good. We ordered a pair each of the carnitas, the brisket, al pastor, one of the huevos & chorizo, as well as one of the carne asada & huevos. All were dry and underseasoned. The green chile they give with the tacos also has no flavor so it didn't help much. In addition, I love soups and stews so have now tried their menudo, posole, as well as their caldo de pollo. The posole is definitely not the traditional you'd expect and unfortunately it's flavorless. Both the menudo and the caldo are a bit too greasy/oily for my liking. Overall, Lulu's just up the street has way better food for the price.

On a few good notes, Barrio Queen's service is always great, their drinks are good, and the ambiance is usually enjoyable. This is a great place to have drinks and appetizers. Don't come here expecting good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm going to review this place and try keep it simple . 

- 30 - 40 minute wait to get there only to wait a bit more since the table wasn't quite ready yet (why send me a text and let me know its ready when its not) and the fact that it was during mid week is mind boggling
- Chips/Salsa came late - in fact I didn't even know we were going to get it so we ordered an appetizer. Some chips were stale as if they mixed it in with fresh ones. Salsa was ok , nothing to rave about though.. 
+ Ordered the Nacho's Chingones for our appetizer and it was good (Yay!) Made up for the stale chips and crappy service so far but wait.....  time to order food!
- I ordered the Pollo in Mole Poblano and the wife got some Tacos (1 of each kind, most expensive tacos every for something so small ) and then we ordered the El Clasico hot dogs \"To Go\". My meal was not flavorful at all and I didn't enjoy it , I tasted my some of my wife's tacos - again no flavor.  Surely, I would assume there would be some effort into this as this place just opened up, right? WRONG! The El Clasico Hot Dog was given to us when we got our food?  I mean if we say it's \"ToGo\" wouldn't you make an executive decision to put in the order til we are almost done?? OH that's right... You hardly came to visit to ask us how everything was --- Thanks for the refill on he water though! Appreciate that ... 

In all our experience there was not so good. We are a sucker for customer service and first impressions - it was definitely not even close to par. The food is not even mexican to say the least. Another \"wannabe\" mexican place with all the hype.  Took home the food and fed the dogs."}
{"text":"Solid spot with creative food and drinks. Friendly service and overall lively environment."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this place. It was good, but not what I expected for the price I paid. Our waiter was very nice, helpful, and very knowledgable. The kitchen seemed slower then average places. The menu seemed confusing to me. I was not really sure what I was getting into. I will be giving it another try to make sure this time was it just a fluke."}
{"text":"I will never go back, my food has been for the second time. Way over priced. They have good tacos and guacamole dip, but 10$ for one guacamole and some seasoning, which its fancy that they make it in front of you but not worth it. Last time we were there we ordered a drink that was disgusting and tasted like aftershave. As long as you stick to there sangria and tacos you will probably like it, but not worth my money."}
{"text":"Long wait, not exceptionally busy. Server was no where to be found for extended periods, no update on when food or drinks would arrive during long waits. Food was pretty good but the prices seemed high for what was received. Friend's dish had to be sent back because it was cold. I would have given three stars, but upon checking my credit card statement and comparing to my receipt, they tacked on a $10 tip to my bill! Never had an issue like this before. Really surprising. Sounds like other reviewers have enjoyed this place, so maybe I just showed up on the wrong night. Regardless, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and it's in a great location. The food is good. Carne asada enchiladas and green chile was tasty. The corn app was delicious. Long waits for everything except the food coming out, perhaps not made to order. The place could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Yikes.  I rarely give 1 star but to be honest, we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  It was obvious that this restaurant has poor management.  Our server  seemed new, was not well trained.  The employees did not work as a team.  He kept asking others for help and no one would stop to help him.  The servers seemed like they really didn't want to work there.  Our server was sweating profusely.  I felt bad for the guy.  He brought us chips and salsa and took our order and we received glasses of water 5 minutes later.  Obviously, he wasn't set up for success in his role.  

The food was below par.   There are just too many good Mexican restaurants around to bother coming back for food that isn't good.  And downtown Gilbert has great options to choose from.  Barrio Queen needs to step up their game or they will be left behind by the competition.  I'm glad we didn't pay for it since we had received a gift card from someone.  You couldn't  pay me to go back there."}
{"text":"As my husband and I walked along the old Scottsdale canal we bumped into a gem.  Barrio's Queen was staring us in the face. 

As we walk in we're greeted by three ladies who were more than happy to seat us as long as we had 25 mins to wait on a table inside but the bar was available, so the bar it was. 

Once seated the bartender asked us what we wanted. It was Taco Tuesday's!!!! 4 tacos for $10!!!! I could definitely live with that. The variety of tacos were insane. I couldn't make up my mind but the bartender was so helpful. 

He suggested the chicken, fish, shrimp and the cactus.  I couldn't wait to get my tacos.  my husband ordered the same.  As the dishes approached us, I saw how the tacos were beautiful displayed on the plate.  I'm licking my lips already

These tacos were by far the best I have had since being in Scottsdale!!!! Yes, I said it. Amazing tacos and for the price. You can eat until your stomach hurts!!!! 

When I finally looked up from my plate the entire place was standing room only. So get there early before 6pm on Tuesday if possible to beat the crowd. 

I'll be here next Tuesday for sure!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had. From the Midwest and came out to Arizona for a weekend trip, would definitely recommend this restaurant in Scottsdale. I ordered the Deaths Door margarita, great for spice lovers. I also got their chorizo enchilada and it was to DIE FOR"}
{"text":"Omg the service was great and Steve loved his pulled pork enchiladas so much the chef came out and introduced himself we love Mexican food!!! This is on the top of our restaurants now"}
{"text":"Ordered table side guacamole and a guy (not even our waiter) dropped off a bowl of guacamole already made in the middle of the table and kept walking without saying a word. I had to almost yell to get his attention for him to turn around so I could ask him why he was putting that on our table and he said \"We don't have enough servers to make table side guacamole\".  I asked him to take it away. I ordered a cheese quesadilla as my meal from our actual waiter. When I received my meal, it was a kids meal. I asked the waiter why I was getting the kids meal and he said \"That's the only quesadilla we have.\" I would think that the server would tell me this while I was ordering. I sent an email to the franchise the next day, but never received a response."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I got the carne Asada and my wife got the queen enchiladas. My carne asada was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. The enchiladas were seasoned perfectly and the sauce was to die for. I probably will never come back because I received the worst service that I have ever received in a Scottsdale restaurant. 

Our server took forever to come to our table when we first got there. And we basically never saw here again, some one else brought us our food and no one ever came to check on us. The next time we saw our waiter was around 20 minutes after we finished eating when she brought us our bill and told us the credit card machine was down. She told us a manager would be buy to assist with a paper ticket then left. 30 minutes later no one came by and finally our waitress returned and seemed shocked that no one had come by to handle our bill.  Ignoring customers and making them wait for service Is a poor retention strategy. The place was clearly not busy as waiters were hanging around our table talking the whole night but our waiter was no where to be found and when you charge Scottsdale prices you should not ignore your customers."}
{"text":"Since we love Mexican food, I asked an Arizona Yelper what her favorite Scottsdale Mexican place was, and her response was \"Barrio Queen\" -so there we went.

They have some really creepy artwork inside- check these babies out!

We ate outside on the patio, and that sure filled up quickly, at the end of our stay, the patio and bar were packed.

We started with an order of tableside guacamole for $12. We thought it was just average and there was no offer of the optional customization we have seen at similar restaurants (onion?, no onion? lots of jalapeno?, etc).

Tacos were on special so we had three each at $2.50 a pop. We mixed them up and sampled steak, shrimp, pork, chicken. Our clear favorite was the shrimp- seriously, they were magnificent. The others were just about average.

Our dinner ran around $39, which wasn't too bad. But honestly, I expected a little better quality.

Honestly, the Mexican meal we had in Sedona at 89Agave ran rings around Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"First the location is nice, the decor is fun and the food was amazing!  We went with out aunt and uncle who were visiting from Florida. Enjoyed the house margaritas and they were great!  You must get the table side guacamole. Our server Micah was fantastic, fun, and very attentive. We enjoyed the Pubil (Pork), chicken enchiladas (suizia)  and the chili rellano. What a great place! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We SOOOOO wanted to love this place.  The outside looks inviting and cool, the inside is decorated nicely with a modern mexican flare and it's clean.  However, walking in the front door, we didn't even get greeted.  The shoulder length blonde haired hostess just stared at us.  I said \"hello\" but she didn't respond.  I said, \"Two for lunch.\" and she grabbed 2 menus and said, \"this way.\"  When we got to our table she was suddenly nice and explained the different menus and told us our waitress would be \"right with us.\"
Yeah..... 20 minutes later, our waitress who had been standing right next to us at the POS system, finally acknowledged us.  M and I both had time to use the restroom, choose our drinks and food, and almost considered walking out.  When she did arrive, she wasn't very friendly and I got a virgin lemonade instead of the alcoholic drink.  
The food was pretty good, I had carne asada taco and carnita taco and calabacitas.  The calabacitas was really greasy.  M had the carnita plate.  
Since the service was soooooooo bad, we won't be going back.  The good food can't make up for how we were treated."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been there a handful of times for lunch, brunch, dinner and drinks.  I have read some of the other reviews and frankly, I am surprised by the non-5 star rankings because Barrio Queen is one of the few places in Phoenix I will drive across town for.  I love to bring my friends and family to Barrio Queen.

Meal:  They just recently changed their menu but their taco options have practically stayed the same.  I almost exclusively get tacos and one of the draft beers . . . especially the Breckenridge Agave Wheat.  Margaritas are also a sure bet too.

Taste:   Perfect, perfect, perfect.  Too many \"fancy taco\" places through out the valley think the more crap they throw on the taco, the better it taste but in reality, it just falls short.  Barrio Queen seems to know exactly the point where if they left something out, it wouldn't be enough and if they added one more spice or thing, it would be too much.  The other thing they do well is taking authentic Mexican food and adding a modern/contemporary twist.  A lot of places try to do just that but what ends up really happening is a dish that lacks any sort of real identity or cohesiveness.  10 out of 10.

Value:  When it comes to the entrees, portion sizes are great.  Tacos, however, are slightly over priced. . . but they always have some sort of special going on with their tacos. They have great happy hour deals and I never leave hungry from this place.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness: Service at Barrio Queen is excellent, especially for Scottsdale.  Most servers and bartenders in Scottsdale seem to be \"too-cool-for school-pissed-off\" 20-something year olds, but the team at Barrio Queen is incredibly friendly.  They aren't afraid either to make recommendations and is very attentive.  9 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  The architecture and music work well for the type of vibe they are going for.  I used to live in Brownsville, TX, which is on the border with Matamoros, Mexico . . . and the music reminds me so much of living in the Rio Grande Valley.  4 out of 5.

Overall:  If I was wanting to try a new place prior to hitting up the bars in Old Town or looking for a new place for Sunday brunch, I highly recommend Barrio Queen.  And whenever I bring friends or family from out of town to Barrio Queen, they absolutely love it.  I would recommend parking in the parking garage just behind/below because on street parking is a pain!  27 points out of 30, 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with daughter and son in law to Barrio Queen during the week, it was around 12pm on a Thursday, no too busy.

To start with I ordered the Cocktel De Elote - grilled corn cut off the cobb, topped with butter, mayo, cotija cheese, valentina, cilantro and lime , this reminds me of when my kids where younger and chasing some dude on a bike with cooler for some corn. But its all grown up now and no longer in a cooler. This appetizer is great! Love the flavors! I could make a meal just out of this!

For lunch I went with 3 tacos for $10, I ordered one carne asada taco and 2 Barrio pollo tacos. The carne asada was tender, it was topped with diced onions, cilantro and avocado, and the Barrio pollo taco was diced chicken, caramelized onions, roasted poblano peppers with a spicy cream sauce topped with queso fresco. Both of these tacos where delish!    

This was a great meal, service was excellent too! Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"They have the Strongest happy hour margarita!  2 shots of tequila in it for $3!  But the service is soooooo slow.  The taco tuesday tacos were a good price.  I only liked the Pollo with the cream sauce.  The other tacos were just ok."}
{"text":"Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for months, but weekends are so busy.We were there by 5;30pm. We went on a Wednesday night. Cory was our waiter. He was very helpful with his knowledge. Great food and large servings. We will have to come back on \"Taco Tuesday\" Great happy hour prices too!"}
{"text":"** Vegetarian Friendly**

Great Mexican restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Great place for large groups. 

Complimentary: chips and salsa
The chips were too oily, but the fire-roasted salsa was tasty.

Appetizer: Table Side Guacamole 
Fun tableside service. Nice and chunky guacamole. Our avocados weren't as ripe as they should have been, but still delicious.

Entrée: Tacos
The 3 tacos for $10 is a great deal. They have three vegetarian taco options on their menu that appeal to a variety of taste buds: El Taco Verduro, Rajas, and Nopalitos. The Nopalitos is made with cactus, and I was very skeptical, but it turned out to be my favorite of the three! Wish the taco tray came with beans, but they didn't. They only have vegetarian beans at their restaurant! The rest of the menu has tons of vegetarian options as well.

Also, extra points for marking their menu with vegetarian option. Overall, I would return!"}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Gilbert.  I've been to Barrio Cafe in Phoenix and to Barrio Queen in Scottsdale and the Gilbert location is equally good.  It was margarita monday which means $2 off all specialty margs.  Got the skinny, which was ok, but you can really taste the cheap tequila.  I remember that being the case with the house marg too.  We got the fries with the street corn on top (which I fell in love with at the Scottsdale location) and they were quite yummy.  The salsa is kind of bland.  The rest of the food was good.  I got the Queen Enchiladas (3 cheeses with spinach and onions and a cream sauce).  They were good, but nothing great.  Others got a variety of tacos.  Good, but very tiny.  Service was great.  We had finished our meal and left out the patio door to head to our car in the adjacent field/parking lot.  As we were pulling away, I spotted our server running after our car.  I left my credit card and she was nice enough to run it out to me.  Now that's service!  Looking forward to going back when it's warmer so we can sit outside."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  Loved the decor and patio.  Clean, bright and comfy chairs.  Service was a bit on the slow side.  A server came out after about 5 minutes and introduced himself, but then another server came and told him that she didn't think that was his table so he left....and then about 5 minutes later a different server came out and took our drink order.  The longest wait was from when we were seated to us getting our first drink.  After that things came out much more quickly.  That said.....drinks were good.  Margaritas were strong and only $3 dollars during happy hour which is apparently all day.  We had the tableside guacamole which was really good.  It was also Taco Tuesday so all tacos are $2.50 instead of $3.50.  I tried the napolitas (sp) which was ok.  It kind of tasted like green beans to me.  A bit on the bland side.  I also had the smoked salmon with mango taco.  That was good, but in my opinion it would have been better with un-smoked salmon.  The mango on it really helped freshen it up though.  My cousin has a burrito and she said it was great and as for the sauce that was on top....well, she wanted to lick it off her plate.  Enough said.  We also shared the flan which, although I am not an expert on flan or anything as I've only had a bite of it a couple of times, it was really, really good.  All in all, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Had sopes, ceviche and Mexican fries all delicious and filling. House margaritas was tasty! Service was a little abrupt and lacking but overall good."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this new location. We have enjoyed the Old Town location in the past, but this was quite a different experience. The salsa was different...not as spicy and therefore not as a good as Scottsdale. The menu is different...no breakfast burritos here like the other location. My husband and I had a good burrito although we recommend skipping the mole sauce- not great. My biggest issue was the kids meals. $6.95 a piece. Whoa! You've got a couple kiddos and omg this is crazy. Maybe they'll be fed like kings?? Nope. The black bean and cheese burrito was honestly something for a 2 year old. My almost 8 year old was still starving afterwards so we had to make a run for the border to Taco Bell. Not worth it all in the end. Oh...and our server was nonexistent. Could t find him most of the meal. After asking for the check for example we waited almost an additional 20 minutes. That's always fun with 3 kids."}
{"text":"This is the best good priced Mexican restaurant in Arizona. Their nachos Chingones is the best nacho appetizer I have ever tasted. I absolutely love their margaritas and their taco combo's as well. My favorites are the Carne Asada, Fried shrimp, and the fish tacos. And for dessert you just have to try their churros it's so delicious!! I would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"so this place is the hot spot huh I think not, service was garbage not even busy had extra servers yet it took 29 minutes to order by the time we ordered people behind us who sat after us were already eating. we went on taco Tuesday we were going to go to joyride but figured hey let's try this place well the tacos are minature which I can deal with but at 2.50 way to tiny joyride is $2 and twice size   and was brought wrong taco after our prolonged wait.
we will not be back"}
{"text":"Told us 45 minutes for a table and took over an hour and a half. Finally got our table and took 15 minutes for th Le server to take our drink order. Really???"}
{"text":"Great tacos and yummy specialty drinks what more could a girl ask for? The staff was friendly and the food came out quick."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks only. We had a house margarita and they were delicious for six dollars. We are unable to comment on the food. However, the salsa and chips are yummy.

Service was pretty good and had an attentive waitstaff. Looks like a good menu to come back and try sometime!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and superb service!! The picante house margarita is delicious and the guacamole was awesome! We came here for my sons birthday and they made the sure we left happy and full!"}
{"text":"I just recently visited here for the first time and I had the cochinita pibil and it was to die for! Our server Cade was very knowledge about the menu and was a great person for a first time experience! The manager Chaz came and check on us right before we left to make sure that everything went well. Of course, no complaints. Nothing but good stuff to say about this place and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Dakota and Nicole at the bar are amazing. No really, Nicole is 100% on top of the ENTIRE bar. It's awesome and in a good way. She know exactly what everyone is drinking abs eating. Future stalker? I don't know but, no one would be disappointed if she was. 

Dakota is also on his game! Friendly, genuine banter. Down to earth guy who knows how to mix a mean drink and make it look like he was an extra on that old Tom Cruise movie Cocktail. 

Make it for the happy hour when these guys are here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Updated review:  I added one more star after my visit last night. I give them props for their food!! Everything was very good. The service though was still very lacking. Our waitress was nice, but after the food was dropped off we didn't see her until we had to flag her down to ask for the bill. 

Original review: Disappointed. Upon walking in we were so excited to try this place. The decor was so cool and it was so busy. They had a wait on a Monday at lunch time. We thought that was a good sign. After waiting for a bit, which we didn't mind, two seats at the bar became available. My friend and I sat there. 
Upon sitting down is when the disappointments started. We weren't greeted. We just had menus sat in front of us. Later a different bar tender came by and asked what we would like to drink. We both got their skinny margarita which was on special. It was $9 on special and it tasted like it was only sweet and sour mix over ice.  Gross. 
The two stars they got were for the food. Chips and salsa were good and the tacos we got were good. 
NEVER ONCE were we talked to after our food was dropped off. The ticket was in a cup in front of us so we both put our cards down. Once the bill was paid and signed for we started to get up to leave and that was the first and only time we were talked to nicely. \"Have a great day ladies\"- WAY too late for that. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"We walked all around the old town looking for the perfect place. So glad we decided on this place. Some times traveling with big group its hard to please everyone. This place was perfect, everyone ended up supper happy. Amazing food, service and ambiance. Will not regret. Nice size portions too, had a great time. Mr. Flores our server was supper attentive and willing to please. An over all perfect experience.... did i mention food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the pozole and 2 tacos, and my husband had the green chile and 3 tacos.  I will say again...the food was absolutely excellent. The margaritas were also light and refreshing.  Some of the other reviews here have been poor due to bad service. Our service was actually pretty good, but I can see that the restaurant either seemed to be understaffed or have servers new to the service industry.  Regardless, the food was incredible and our overall experience here was great."}
{"text":"My first time at Barrio Queen was awesome! Quentin was my waiter he's the man! Very friendly took good care of us. Order the Guacamole from him he's the master. Overall a 5 Star experience"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was average.
Complimentary chips and salsa were provided.
Ceviche wasn't anything special, I could probably make a better one at home :/ it was in a red tomato sauce and I think I prefer lime, clear marinades more.
Service was average. Server was not but not attentive at all. Checked on us only once, had to ask to have water refilled and then didn't refill it when it was out again."}
{"text":"Silvana is the best most innovative Mexican chef on the planet as far as I am concerned. I am talking authentic high quality ingredients blended with  great love and  super creative artistry.

This is not americanized super sized mexican.

This IS  a heavenly experience!!!!!!!!! save a seat for me at the bar i plan to work my way through the menu one sublime bite at a time"}
{"text":"This is our third visit to Barrio Queen and unfortunately this time the service was not that great. Everything was going fine, drinks were good, the atmosphere is nice...When our food was brought to the table we asked for silverware, he said I'll be right back. About 5 minutes later our waitress came by to see how we liked the food, we asked her for silverware. After another 4 minutes I went to the prep type station where other workers were and asked them for silverware, they were out but said they would tell our waitress. In about another 3 minutes our waitress went to another table then brought us our silverware. We might come back because we do like this place but it will be awhile. There are a lot of nice places around, hoping Barrio Queen customer service gets better!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this location. 
My family and I came for double birthdays this last Saturday night. After a bit of a wait (no reservations) we were seated at a nice table outside. That's about the last time anyone visited our table. We ordered drinks-- waters and iced teas. There were 5 of us and we received 4 waters. We asked over and over for an additional water and finally gave up. We ordered the famous guacamole. They wheeled the cart over there and the server made it in complete silence. At the Scottsdale location they engage with you and tell you about what they are making. It definitely took away from the experience. Overall we probably saw our server twice, once for drinks once for food. We never got refills on any of the drinks (which were empty mid dinner) and were never asked if we wanted more chips or salsa. 

Food was just okay. I got a chicken burrito and the tortilla was pretty gummy from the sauce in the inside. I didn't even want to take my leftovers home. My family got enchiladas though and really enjoyed  them however.

The women's restroom was a disaster. Not something I would expect to see at a nicer restaurant.

Seems like this location has a lot to work out still. Yes they were busy but they need to have more people working if that's the case. Overall I would not recommend this location based solely on (lack of) service."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The ceviche was awesome the Huitalocoche quesadillas were to die for, but the stuffed poblano pepper with shrimp and crab was exquisite!!!! Well worth your time and money if you are in the area. Definitely one of my regular places from now on!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised Barrio Queen only has 3.5 stars on Yelp.  I'm no stranger to Mexican cuisine having been brought up in a Mexican household and I struggle to find restaurants that are better than what I make at home.  Barrio Queen is definitely one of these places.  The taco menu is extensive; after tasting almost every taco, I can vouch that they're mostly really good. (The pescado was the only dud I found; that's mostly my fault because I don't love fried food.)  I've also had the Cochinita Pibil torta and the half order of the guacamole... both amazing.

It tends to be on the expensive side so I opt for Taco Tuesday where you can stuff yourself full of tacos, chips and salsa, beer, and margaritas for less than $20."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love the decor! Service was great and margaritas are top notch!!! I'm glad they opened a location closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night with guest from out of town. The alcohol was good but that's pretty much it. The server got our order wrong and the tacos that came out had old/brown avocados on top. If you're going to charge me $4 a taco, at least have a fresh green slice of avocado and not a brown/ black slice . 
Disappointing visit..."}
{"text":"Pretty good, a little pricey.

Just warm enough to sit on their patio which although next to the street is nice. Service was a bit slow, although friendly enough when they arrived. Was feeling frisky and ordered a couple of their top of the line margaritas, not sure what I was thinking ($15 ea!) but boy were they good. Had some sort of \"special\" where the drinks came with a couple of souvenir shot glasses (as-if I need them but guess it was to make one feel better about the price of the drink!) When we split a third margarita later, had to negotiate for another shot glass. Sheesh.

Asked for some chips and no free chips. that always irks me (especially after having just ordered a couple of overpriced drinks). So ordered chips along with the house salsa, sort of interesting flavor but very watery to the extent that it wouldn't even stay on the chips - the chips we had to purchase. Disappointing. Went ahead and also ordered their guacamole (advertised as \"made table-side\" - but it's not). Very very good. Not the typical mashed style - huge chunks of avocado. If you're an avocado and onion fan, you'll love the guac.

I ordered the Barrio Pollo burrito, very tasty. My Sweetie ordered tacos, don't remember which but she enjoyed them.

Overall, we agreed the food was good, but overpriced ('course, it's located in Old Town $cottsdale so I guess that's the norm). 

Wouldn't go out of our way, but if in the immediate area might come back."}
{"text":"Tacos are great! House margarita is pretty good. The creme brûlée was just ok. The costumer service is lacking."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, I never like leaving bad reviews. But sometimes they're got to be done: so here it goes.

The food itself was just Badddd. The quality of the ingredients sucked, didn't taste well, overpriced in my opinion for what you're getting. And food came out ice cold until we told them about it. Never coming back"}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I stopped there for lunch spontaneously about a week ago. Hadn't planned to but were driving past that exit on the 101 when I got hungry. Simply drove into Desert Ridge and saw it and figured \"what the hell\". We have dined at the original Barrio Queen, under both owners, multiple times so there was already a certain expectation. I must tell you that my expectations were exceeded. To begin with, our server, I wish that I could remember her name, she had very dark hair and was slightly older than the others, was just perfect. She should be working at a much higher end restaurant for bigger tips. She was just delightful and right on top of everything without being in your face. The food was also better than I would have expected for a \"strip center\" restaurant. Chips and salsa were MUCH better than most. My wife loved her fish tacos and I was pleasantly surprised by my \"Sonoran\" hot dog. While not all that \"Sonoran\" it was nonetheless really tasty. We will definitely be back when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I ate here the day after Christmas. We asked to be seated outside. We got seated but it took a while for a server to take our order and it wasn't too busy that afternoon. I had the pick any 3 tacos which was $9 and a side of rice and beans which an additional cost. The tacos were tiny and not too bad in flavors. The rice and beans were okay. The well known table side guacamole are holy crap expensive at $14 and not a big portion but pretty good. My friend ordered a burrito which was a big portion but overpriced as well at $15. We also had churro for dessert which was good but just too sweet for my liking. Overall, the food was overpriced for an okay food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I loved the look and feel of the place. I had the Queso de Cabra Ensalada and thought it was really good. My husband, daughter and friend however were no thrilled with their food.  Not only was it expensive but the carne asada burrito had more beans than meat and the kids meal was veggies were gross.  

Definately not out favorite."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Phoenix from Canada and planned to go to another nearby restaurant until we read the reviews. After looking online arrrived at Barrio Queen with a party of 15...parents and older teens. Carlos, our waiter, was so awesome.  He highlighted his favorites and we almost all chose off of his recommendations.  We were very glad we did as all of his recommendations were amazing... even our fussy teens.  Definitely would come back again and worth a stop if your in town.  A must for anyone staying in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Yup, I took a friend and went back again after reading some of the reviews. I thought maybe we got lucky the first time around. Still some of the BEST Mexican food and service was good. We sat outside and again the staff was great about getting a heater near us for comfort. We had to wait a little bit for the bill, but other than that, I still think this is a great new restaurant. We ordered tacos, guacamole, flan and two sodas. I'm still not sure what some of the items are, but that's just an excuse to go back. One of the staff/workers told us about the local artists that did the tables and art work, and the concept of the restaurant. I still love this place. YUM."}
{"text":"I love when the pomegranate gauc is in season!! It is my all time favorite. It is a fun place to go with a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever came across. The male server was the most disrespectful person I have ever met. Considering I am a bartender an server at a Mexican restaurant I know how to treat customers right as they are always right if they are not satisfied. We asked if they had beans an rice an he told us to go Taco Bell if we wanted that. He said his manager told his employees to say that... How disrespectful? I asked for a blended margarita an he said to go to 7 eleven an get a slurpee there... I will never come back to this place unless they get new management or figure out how to communicate w costumers."}
{"text":"Delish brunch spot!!  They take mexican brunch dishes and add a special touch. For instance, they have these amazing fries that they melt cheese on and add corn to...nice touch!  Eggs were yummy.  Love love love this spot for brunch and when I walked by at dinner time it was totally happening so I assume that is good too!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 5-10 mins without a hello- so I went to the counter to ask to be seated. (On a Sunday night, this is the only way to go - I guess). The Waitress was very nice, quick, and helpful. The food was nothing out of the ordinary, I had carne asada, I think the carne asada at the local drive in is better. I was a little let down. Except for the guac- the $10 guac is fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to really love the food at Barrio Queen but I'm sad to say that the food has really gone downhill. First of all the ice water tastes like it could have come straight out of the toilet even with lemon added to it, so you're forced to buy a drink. Water should never taste that bad at a restaurant. The chips came out loaded with grease so we asked for another basket which was not much better, we usually eat two baskets of chips when we are there but sadly only ate a few. The salsa literally had no flavor and was very watered down. Our shrimp tacos were a huge disappointment! Two pieces of burned shrimp in tortillas that fell apart. 
So sad that I have to find another place to go to for shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Service has always been top notch. 

This is my fourth visit. I'm giving Barrio and extra STAR because my wife likes it so much. She's gotta have her tableside Guac. I myself, am not a participant in the mass delusion that avacado has any value; bland mushy culinary imposter... but I digress. 

My caution to you --
I learned my lesson from my previous 3 dissappointments with their tacos. I'll just say they are trying to do too much and not doing anything well in the taco department. Use caution because you might find yourself thinking or saying:
  Is this it?
  Really?
  Less is not more... less is less.
  Why is this so bland and dry?
  Hey, sup wit deez extra thick super oily chips yo? - OK so that's not taco related, got a little carried away there.

Saving grace --
This go 'round I got the Carne Asada burro (sans Guac... bleech). Taaaaayyyysty! I have finally vectored in on a true winner here.

My wife thinks very highly of Barrio's beef enchiladas. Having polished off her leftovers several times, I agree.

I'm elated with my burrito epiphany. Now when the siren avacado song once again draws my wonderful pod-person wife to Barrio for tableside Gauc, I'll officially be happy I'm there.

Another tequila please."}
{"text":"The first time we came to Barrio Queen was on a Saturday evening and there was an hour wait. So we headed over to a neighbor restaurant. However, I was able to come here for lunch the other day with no wait. Our original server wasn't around so we got this lovely, older Hispanic male. He was so fun and friendly that quite frankly, he made our dining experience enjoyable.

I ordered the La Linda drink, the guacamole, the carne asada taco, the pescado taco, and the churro. The food was subpar, lacked flavor and the asada was dry. The alcoholic drink and the churro were good.

Would I come back? Not sure. I can think of other places I would pick that are similar in trendy atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"For my 1400th review, I've chosen a very cool, hip spot in Old Town Scottsdale.  The prices here are for upscale Mexican food and are steep, so don't expect a deal.  However, what you can expect is a different take on old classics served in a hipster environment.  I met a colleague here for dinner and I ordered:

Guacamole, $10.75

Vasito de Elote (Grilled Corn, Butter, Mayo, Cotija Cheese, Tapatio Salsa, Cilantro, Lime), $5

Carne Asada Burrito, $15

Margaritas, $6

The Guacamole i served table-side and is very good.  It's rich, so if you're not sharing it, order the half portion.  The Carne Asada Burrito is also very good.  When I asked the server \"What's a specialty here that I must try?\", he said the Vasito de Elote...which is a Grilled Corn appetizer.  I followed his lead and tried it...it's amazing!  A rainbow of flavors explode on your taste buds when you eat it....Sweet, Buttery, Tangy, with a little Spice...yum!

The Margaritas here rock.  Very tasty...I think I put down 5 or 6, I can't remember.  Good thing I wasn't driving.

Overall, it was a very good experience.  It's definitely on my rotation to take clients and colleagues.  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Parking is no bueno, but that's a problem everywhere in Old Town Scottsdale.

{"text":"Referred by a friends glowing endorsement. I was impressed. Besides the unique atmosphere folks of all types fill the tables, booth and bar, moderate noise levels and a robust menu. It all makes for what appears to be a terrific gem just of old scottdales Fifth Avenue.   I sat check it out."}
{"text":"The Manager reached out after my issues with the waiter. That was really nice of him. He seemed very concerned. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Whitley was awesome! Always kept our drinks and chips full. I went with the 3 tacos for 10 bucks. I got the pescado, carne asada and barrio pollo. All three were great. I would get all three of those again! Wasn't too busy on a weeknight no wait and tons of tables open. Music had me dancing though. Very poppin at the Barrio Queen! T'was lit as they say. Absolutely love there chips and salsa. Went through 3 baskets of them and I'm not even a fatty. They are just that good! Fresh made thick puffy corn chips. Also lit af bro. #whatislift #barrioqueendidntlift"}
{"text":"Rounding up to 5 stars for the fresh, tasty and inspired dishes that aren't too \"creative\" or Americanized.  Oh, and the best sangria I have ever had.

We did breakfast here (and I'd done other meals here before yelp came along).  Outstanding flavors.  The enchiladas with shredded chicken, another with mole, topped with fried eggs and sided with beans and potatoes.  Delish.  My partner (a serious mole fan) raved about the sauce.

Enthusiastic services, beautiful locale and, oh...

The sangria: crisp, flavorful and on the job.  Simply refreshing."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey. Service was subpar, we had to ask an employee to be assigned a waiter after waiting 10 minutes seated. The tacos are well made but very small...you can get the same taco for much cheaper outside of Scottsdale. If the service was better, I would come back. I probably won't."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it was excellent each time. I had the breakfast burrito with beans instead of chorizo because I'm a vegetarian. One burrito is three meals for me. The eggs in the burrito are the fluffiest eggs I have ever had. The chipotle mashed potatoes are also the best side on the menu. Oh, and you can't skip out on the horchata!"}
{"text":"Try the white sangria.. Woooo peaches!! I had the chicken burrito and it was bursting with chicken and full of flavor! Major thumbs up and the outdoor patio in downtown Gilbert is really cute and a nice place to enjoy the Arizona sunset"}
{"text":"From the food to the service we were super impressed! You'll be lucky if you get Victor as your server. We definitely recommend the nachos!"}
{"text":"Really good. The chili Verde burrito was super.  Carne asada burrito was awesome. Our server Adrian was fun and had great suggestions.   If you are looking for good Mexican food in Scottsdale, this is the joint."}
{"text":"Great service and fabulous food!! I had the chiles en nogada which were exquisite and so was the guacamole. Clean restaurant and nice outdoor patio.  Pamela was our server. She was efficient and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"After having lived in Scottsdale for a while, I've driven past Barrio Queen many times. It seems like a good place from the way the restaurant looks, their menu, etc. but it's not really worth it. We were told we would have two waiters, and that didn't seem to work out well. One of them decided to point out to me that there was a fly in my food and flying around my face. THAT'S THEIR FLY. Flies in THEIR restaurant and the waiter has the nerve to point out to me that there's a fly on me. No apology. The tacos are TINY. You'd have to order AT LEAST 6 of them to feel full, and that would run you $20. The carne asada was tough and not very tasty. The brisket, however, was rather delicious, especially with the tomatillo salsa. Also the tamarind agua fresca was good, but it was $5. My girlfriend ordered the azteca enchilada, and everything on the plate was soggy. Soggy beans, soggy vegetables, soggy enchilada. I asked for a water towards the end of the meal and never received it. This place is nothing but a tourist trap. I could have had better tacos at Chipotle. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh, have I tried so hard to like Barrio Queen, more than once, with the same poor outcome...

I went here for my birthday, and I'll try to keep it shorter than my 3 hour wait, even though I was told it would only be a 30 minute wait, an hour at the longest, and people were sat before me that had arrived after me. But they apologized...finally....and did make it up to my party and myself and thankfully the food was good. However, they made an impression and it was bad, but I tried to overlook their obvious lack of service, gave them the benefit of the doubt, good food will always win me over.

So, I considered this experience a fluke (very nice of me...) and I decided to go again on a slow Tuesday and give them a new chance. I ordered a margarita with no salt, what did I get? Salt...and mind you, we were at a booth next to the bar, and our server was the bartender and it was slow. I proceeded to order items, which I had ordered before, that were actually good the first time. Imagine my surprise, when the food I received looked like someone had just thrown random items on the plate with guacamole that was already turning brown as compared to when it came neatly presented to me and looking so tasty and fresh the first time. I inquired: had plating changed? Was there a problem with their avocados, produce, etc? The server said no, I pointed to the obviously wilted and browning ingredients- I was getting frustrated. I continued through the remaining sloppy dishes, while the manager decided to sit at the booth next to us and chitchat apparently with some business buddies. Who's commentary of every girl that walked by was extremely distasteful instead of keeping an eye on the kitchen and watching quality control. I was not asked for a second drink until the meal was finished, our water was never refreshed even though our glasses went empty halfway during the meal, and obviously not asked how our meal was/went. I tried, I really did...but lack of customer service and inconsistent food quality will have me avoiding this place even if I was starving and desperate."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went in yesterday for lunch to check it out and try the happy hour and we were nothing but impressed. Very nice hostess staff and a beautiful patio. we got a couple margaritas and tried the pork tinga appetizer. EVERYTHING WAS PHENOMENAL!! Kara and Frank were the bartenders and they always had us taken care of and made great drinks. Food came out in timely manner and was delicious. Very excited to have this place around and cant wait to go back and try all the food we saw and smelled coming out, oh and the guac cart!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday (Saturday) to celebrate two bdays! We had 17 in our party and had called ahead of time to find out about reservations. Although they did not take any the hostess gave me pointers..get there before the evening crowd, have at least 1/2 the party present and be patient. 40 min later we had our table (happy dance) ...we passed the time at the bar and found the bartenders busy but friendly and attentive. They sat us in the patio like we hoped for and realy enjoyed the nachos and papas appetizers before dinner. We had no complaints about the food... from the bacon wrapped hot dog, tacos,burritos, tortas to the enchiladas. ..everything was good! Thank you for making our night awesome! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think they have awesome chips and salsa. Tacos are fairly decent. Good appetizers and friendly staff with a great environment in downtown gilbert. I wish tacos came with rice and beans as they are already slightly overpriced for the size in my opinion"}
{"text":"Came for lunch! Staff are very nice! Ambience is comfortable and elegant! Food is decent! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Well....  They say it's unique, innovative Mexican Style Food, so I'll go with that !    lol

The atmosphere is great and the service is almost friendly !  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!! The gluten free options are nearly endless & the food is sooooo good!! Hannah at the bar is truly amazing and makes a killer La Tunita!! (her specialty) Every single thing we've ordered has been delicious!! Even the ceviche is gluten free!! The chips have a dedicated fryer! I just can't say enough good things about Barrio Queen!! Come in and taste it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"I expected more... Food is pretty good , but does not stack up to the hype. Decor is pretty cool if you are in to the whole \"dead\" thing... I must have come on an off night. It's like a giant bus from Sun City stopped by and unloaded a bunch of old people into this place. I kid you not.. Oh and the real kick in the balls was when they came with the check... 3 entress and 4 margarita comes to $103.63!!! WTF..."}
{"text":"This place not only has delishish food, but awesome servers.  We had one server bu the name of Tara who was so bubbly and prompt.  She always had a smile and really was on top of her game."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times and honestly want to love this place. The vibe, decor, service is all spot on, but the food. I can't get past the food and the weak margaritas. 

Honestly, if they could just put a little more tequila in their margaritas - they taste so watered down and they're expensive! and add some spice to their food, I would be eating here all the time. 

I'm going to continue trying this place out and will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"First time at any of their locations as had a great experience.  Service was great and love the thicker chips with salsa"}
{"text":"Our first time here and many kinks need to be worked out. We were a large party and the head of our group showed up an hour early to reserve our table. They inadvertently gave our table away so we had to wait longer. That wouldn't have been as big a problem but the time spent on the patio would have been great had the server offered drinks for happy hour. He didn't discuss the drinks with the group that arrived early and by the time he made it back to our table he wouldn't accommodate us since it was 6:02. Once we finally got seated it took another hour before our frazzled server took our order. One of the girls in our party moved to a different chair which totally threw him off course. His english wasn't very good and didn't seem to know the menu well.
Our orders were messed up and when trying to present us with the food he kept asking \"did you order the...\" name of the dish? All we knew how to answer was with \"chicken or beef tacos\".
We complained early on and were granted tableside quac which was good but not enough for our party so we kept asking for more. One was prepared spicier than the other. I guess no two are alike. 
The prices were a bit high for what you get. The live music so loud it's impossible to have a conversation.
I hope they work on service because if you have time this might be a try on a special occasion place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Scottsdale, we have to eat here! Best guacamole & tacos! The meat is cooked to perfection. Amazing drinks...especially love the Micheladas with the Tamarind candy straw!"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio. Food was good, staff was friendly. Good wine selection. Extra charge for chips salsa."}
{"text":"I just walked out. I was seated and no one came to help us. Horrible customer service.  Really bummed out because I was very hungry. Went to sandbar instead."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my co-workers. I had the 3 tacos. I did all the veggie ones and I also ordered seasoned fries. Unfortunately the fries were kind of big and some were not cooked all the way through. The tacos were just OK. The waiter was really attentive and the place itself was nice."}
{"text":"Food was great and servers as well as hostesses were all very nice. Especially one in particular, her name was Iliana she was great!"}
{"text":"Be prepared. This is not TexMex. This is not a chain. This is a FANTASTIC local establishment that offers an incredible latin menu that will inspire your taste buds. For example: I hate almost all guacamole. But when it's made tableside and I'm at Barrio Queen, it's simply the best! The ingredients are fresh, you can get creative with what you want in it - like who'd think pomegranates and guac go together? It's simply wonderful here. My husband is a green chile verde connoisseur and he's always impressed with the flavor of the chile verde and quality of the carnitas. When the weather's nice, I love the patio and having a cocktail. Their drinks are always made with fresh juice and agave nectar which makes the 1,000 tequilas they have behind the bar taste even better!

You haven't lived until you've had Cochinita Pibil. Order it. Eat it. Love it! Then come back and order it again!"}
{"text":"I am not one who loves to go out for Mexican food, but with encouragement from friends, I went to enjoy a lunch. I had the chopped salad. I loved it! Greens (not enough to be called a salad, but I asked for more greens) corn, black beans, onions, avocado, tortilla chips and a spicy chipolte dressing. It had such a great mix of flavors. 
We decided to try the table side guacamole. It was good. Not great. And certainly not worth $12.  
I'll continue to come back for the chopped salad."}
{"text":"Wow. Home made CHILS and salsa brought to you are A+!!! I couldn't stop eating them even to try my street tacos when they arrived. I got the al pastor and it was the BEST I've ever had I honestly can't wait to go back and get more. So sweet and tangy and perfect. The enchilada Suizas were good too but a bit dry for me. I like saucy. All of our portions were huge and delicious everyone was obsessed with what they ordered we only wish we saved room for dessert but we will be back! Even the kids quesadilla was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, so we thought that we would give Barrio Queen Scottsdale a try. 

This is a much larger restaurant,  with cool decor but too many chachkies for sale. The waiter was patient and attentive. Our only complaint regarding service was that another person brought us a menu of specials AFTER we had already ordered! It would have been nice to see it before!

The Carnitas Michaocan was plentiful, but not very flavorful. Disappointing for a whopping 20 bucks! It didn't even come with any tortillas. The ones I ordered on the side were three baby street taco tortillas.  The loaded fries appetizer was good. I would have rather had that for a meal, to be honest. 

The kids had the Carne Asada tortas. They each ate very little, but said it was good. Who knows, really? The rest of our party had street tacos. Very expensive at 3 tacos for $10 and extra for any rice and/or beans. The Carne Asada and pastor had a pretty good flavor.

The chips and salsa were good. The iced tea was weak. I recall the Phoenix Cafe having a great passion or fruit tea. Not here.

I don't know that I will come back to this location. For what you receive, not worth the high price."}
{"text":"While traveling through old the senora and I decided to give the place a try. After walking in and taking a seat our server came over and was very pleasant. She talked about the comida but because we weren't real hungry settled for Pozole. The meal was very good. We enjoyed how the meal tasted and enjoyed the beer too. They have a large selection and an huge selection of Tequila's to try as well.

On their shirts it says \"Comida a toda madre\" I am not sure how the rest of the food is but what we had was very rico!"}
{"text":"Our hotel suggested that we visit the Barrio Queen, Scottsdale for Mexican food. There were 3 in our party. The service was good. The food was good the margaritas were not so good. My wife sent hers back because it had a strange taste. Her second margarita was a bit better but did not taste much better than the first. We were not charged for her drinks. My margarita was very sour but I did finish it. If we return to Scottsdale and we are looking for a truly good Mexican restaurant we will not return to the Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Great new location in the heart of Desert Ridge. Food was great, delivered in a timely manner. Service was the best part! Jenn M made sure we were taken care of and informed of the menu and provided us with one of the best service experiences we've had at a restaurant here in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Best guacamole I've ever had. Everything was super fresh. Our waitress was friendly and attentive - we will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here on Mexican Independence Day and ordered their Independence Day special. It was an appetizer, a taco of my choice, an entrée, a drink and a desert. It seemed like a good deal and I suppose it is if you're looking for a good volume of food. They don't short you on portions with the entrée. I chose the guacamole for the appetizer and it was tasty topped with pomegranate. We chose a nopal taco which was also good. Why the three stars?  It's not that they did anything wrong but when I looked at what what was included in the \"special\" I realized it would have been less expensive if I would have ordered it all separately. To me this is a place you have to check out for the cool day of the dead art. Otherwise I would describe the food as lack luster."}
{"text":"Guacamole was absolutely amazing; had the camaron quesadilla which was also fantastic.  Nice, mellow music on the back patio.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow!   Went in Friday night for dinner and we were so thrilled with our waitress Victoria. She was so attentive and on top of everything we needed.  She anticipated what we might want before we even asked for it!  It was so refreshing to see such a young person do their job so well and be joyful doing it. It seems like you don't see this kind of attention to detail in most young people today. The food was also very delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. We sat out on the patio with a nice breeze. I got three tacos.. They are delicious but small beware. There are many different choices and all look delicious. This is a good place to go when you want tasty food but aren't too hungry. The chips and salsa were good. There was a wait so we put our name on the list. I wasn't overly impressed by the food for the wait."}
{"text":"First time to try Barrio Queen.  Sat outside for party of 2 only.   Table was too small.  Hard to fit drinks, chips and salsa.  Outside was so hot.  No misters or fans.  Inside was cooler.  Should have eaten inside.   Food was okay.  Chicken Burrito suggested by staff was great.  2 street tacos were flavorless and dry.  Did not enjoy.   Hard to say if I would go back.  Just depends if I am with someone who really wants wants to go again."}
{"text":"Good food, service, & atmosphere. We went there for \"Restaurant Week\" and the menu included a margarita, appetizer, main corse, & dessert all for $33/person. The signature pork (Cochinita Pibil) was excellent as usual, tried the chile relleno with vegetables and it was a little watery & needed some spice, flan was ok but the dessert churro was awesome. 2nd time we've been there and have yet to get table side guacamole made every one else got it but us (again)."}
{"text":"So to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night my wife and I were eager for a margarita. We decided would try Barrio Queen. We had been there before late at night and really liked it. We bring the kids, 14, 10, and 5. Okay that's a little risky but it's not a quiet place and my kids are pretty well behaved and they want to celebrate too. So it was an unusually perfect night out out and as we walked up at 6 pm there were lots of spots on the patio. We asked for a patio seat and we're told 30-45 minutes. Kind of a surprise but okay. So after 1:15 we are still waiting as party after party arrive well after us and fill up the patio. We finally said we would sit anywhere and eventually get seated at an indoor table. We get one of those tables down the main aisle with a booth bench on one side and chairs on the other. Not perfect for a family but whatever. Just got worse after that. Can't find our server, then can't get our drinks. Takes another 20 minutes just to finally get a margarita. Finally order. The food comes in bursts with some of us finished eating before other food arrives. Our table side guacamole appetizer gets served after we are all done eating our entrees. It was bizarre. Seemed deliberately kid UNFRIENDLY. Worst service I have had out in over 10 years and we eat out frequently.  To give you an idea, I have never written a negative review until now.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with some coworkers and had a great experience! Our waiter provided superior service, the complimentary chips and bean dip was delicious, and the tacos were amazing!!! 
The quality of food for the great price on Taco Tuesday is win-win!! I tried a barrio pollo taco, shrimp taco, fish taco, and the huevos con chorizo taco.  All were delicious, but the pollo and fish tacos were by far my fave!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ate at Barrio Queen. My husband ordered the Arizona Burrito. I could not believe the size of the Burrito. He said it was the best he ever had. So I ordered the same. I am not a rice fan, and this dish had no rice but plenty of Pork and a wonderful Chili verde sauce. Our Waiter Aaron
was great. Friendly and knowledgeable. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Probably The Best cocktail menu I've come across in the East Valley - not every drink was loaded down with sweet sugary/fruity ingredients - even have a chile infused Mezcal which was delicious. Food was great - we had tacos since it was Taco Tuesday and there was a huge variety to choose from, all unique and extremely flavorful. Table side guacamole was excellent and a great sized portion. Everything else we saw going to other tables looked equally good. Our server - Nick was fast, friendly and had great recommendations, he took very good care of us. Price for what you got including quality, speed, and ambience is a great value. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am shocked by the low reviews people have posted. I'm somewhat of a \"foodie\" and have a fairly high standard for restaurant food. My husband and I stumbled on this place when visiting Scottsdale, and we loved it so much, we drove all the way back to Scottsdale to eat there for lunch before our plane left a couple days later. Excellent margaritas! Fresh chips, delicious salsa, and table-side guac with pomegranate was a total win!! Great combination of flavors, super cool decor, and friendly people! Would do it again any day! ...in fact, we already did!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Not your traditional Mexican food. More authentic out of central Mexico. Salsa was great. There are many tacos to choose from. We had pollo, carne Asada, and brisket. Also got a carne Asada torta. Was very good. The fries were awesome with the seasoning. For desert we had the Churros and ice cream. 
There are a lot of tequilas available too."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We ordered tacos and their guacamole, created table side both of which were excellent. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"It literally sucks. I gave them two chances. After the first time it was whatever I even tipped better than my coworkers and this time I went I got a Cesar salad I got two big ass romaine leaves haha what???? It's funny to me. I'm just not gonna deal with them again."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a favorite spot for my friends and I to frequent. I love it. I have had almost everything on the menu and there isn't one thing on there that you should shy away from. I will often order the Michelada and am NEVER disappointed. The wait staff is lovely and inviting and the vibe can be buzzy if you hit DT Gilbert at the wrong time. I suggest coming with the intention of having some drinks, a few appetizers and a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so bad, I've heard so many amazing reviews. Service was unremarkable. Not bad but not great. 

Food:
Salsa was watery. 

I asked for a diet Dr Pepper, which is on the menu - but the waiter said they didn't have it. 

Guacamole was too chunky, you either get all avocado or all the mix-ins, not really a combination of the two. 

I ordered one of the Tortas - pork. I had 2 bites and was done. Not a fan. At all. French fries were just sprinkled with chili powder. 

I'm not in a hurry to come back here, ever."}
{"text":"Late night munchies, and a new place to visit. Server was very attentive, food came out fast and hot. Taste was amazing. Almost as good as real Mexican Street Tacos......almost, only because we're not on the street"}
{"text":"love love love barrio queen. order the guacamole **extra extra** spicy, because \"spicy\" is actually very mild. queso, salads, enchiladas, everything is great. if i remembered our server's name, i'd give her a shoutout. she's served us twice, and has been nothing less than exceptional!!! i've been to both locations, about 15x or more in total."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambience and the taco Tuesday special is nice ($3 for non-premium tacos). 

HOWEVER, they charge for soft drink refills? Then when I ordered from the bar I was told they don't offer frozen margaritas????? Only rocks. Seriously? If you're gonna charge $3.50 for a coke refill, buy a damned blender!!! 

Tonight's visit was my second. The tacos were good, as they were the first time. There was a minor error with my order but not a huge deal. Based on the taste and the Taco Tuesday pricing, tonight's visit earned a 3 out of 5 overall. 

Like I said, it's a nice location in Desert Ridge but a couple miles down Cave Creek road you can get more food for the money at Valle Luna, and most importantly, they know how to crush ice at the bar."}
{"text":"We went on Christmas Eve.  What a beautiful place!  Staff is happy and very attentive.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just got back from my first Barrio queen visit. Let me start with 2 great reasons to eat here......1.50 happy hour tacos 2-6pm mon- fri and free chips n salsa.
Both lost when you  eat at most trendy taco restaurants. Good house salsa and thick fresh chips.
I had the green chile n pork tacos which were tastey. 
Nice decor and pleasant music playing insde.
We had 9 happy hour tacos, coke, 2 marg, chips n salsa for 35.00 w tip
The only negative i see is that their full price menu could leave you with sticker shock."}
{"text":"So, TVS and I had his birthday dinner last night - been doing this for thirty years now; that is a long friendship. I buy his birthday dinner in the spring, he buys mine in the fall. Only rule is we only go to locally-owned family restaurants. Last night it was Barrio Queen in Scottsdale and the food was incredible. Drinks list had about 60 different tequilas, so that was the starter along with Negro Modelo beer on draft and queso fundido (Mexican fondue + chorizo) with chips. I had their amazing cochinita pibil - slow-roasted pork (14 hours) marinated in sour orange and achiote chili paste, and served with pickled sour orange onions and pico de gallo, plus arroz verde and frijoles negros,,,,,,,, Damn it was good. Meat was from the heart of the roast with strands of tender pork 3-4 inches long; amazing flavors and tender as a lover's kiss.
Finished off with flan & excellent whisky/caramel sauce, and after ordering coffee and heading to the men's room, I came back to a plunger pot of excellent French press waiting for me. That is a great finish. Nice Joynt - TVS said he's be taking his wife there soon"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has a great deal of hype associated with it. Unfortunately it did not live up to the expectations. Went for Happy Hour on Taco Tuesday. The house margarita was so-so, no biggie. Had 3 street tacos and all were disappointing. Had the grilled shrimp: cold, over cooked, so tasteless that it was buried under a ton of cabbage and aioli. The grilled fish was equally uninspiring. Overall, not going to hurry back"}
{"text":"Not impressed had 3 different tacos and a side of black beans. Only the beans were serve at what I think is a food safe temperature. What is so hard about serving hot food ? I pay $11.00 for 3 street size tacos they need to be served properly and be tasty.  0 for 2 BQ"}
{"text":"There was a line when we got there, so I thought, \"Great Choice\"!  The food (tacos), came out cold.  Literally no heat to them at all.  I ordered a classico hot dog.  I asked the waitress if the dog they brought me was a classico?  She said no.  I reminded her that's what I ordered, she then ran off and brought me back a bowl of chorizo.  The dog I had was smothered in black beans only, didn't even have what the other dog, should have on it. The one I ordered should be, \"Topped with jalapeño sauce, caramelized red onions, chorizo, tomatoes, mustard and mayo.\"  The one I had was smothered in black beans, now with chorizo on the side.  It was one of the silliest things I've ever experienced.  I told her to just take it off the bill.  I will never return, they can't make a hot dog, the way they say on the menu, or even close.  I left hungry.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Delicious and will be back! The carnitas werent as flavorful as I was hoping. We liked the breaded shrimp, carne asada, and brisket tacos best. Complimentary chips are amazing. 

If you're not an onion fan, I suggest holding them to the side bc there is a lot.

Can't wait to come back and try more.

Also, came on Taco Tuesday so tacos were even cheaper!"}
{"text":"I have to say that we already love Barrio Queens food! The pork nachos are a must have at every dinner. However, tonight the shining star was our server named Kaleb L. What an extraordinary young man! Extremely polite, extremely on top of our every need, everything any good manager would dream of having! We literally didn't wait on fresh drinks or anything we requested for more than about sixty seconds. I hope that someone from management is able to receive this review and recognize this young man for a job well done. Having been a restaurant manager for many years I appreciate great service and this employee is a true attribute to your brand. Thank you Kaleb for a wonderful evening! 
Sincerely,
The Dahse Family"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Barrio Queen while visiting Scottsdale for dinner. Safe to say the experience was not a letdown! We sat outside on a chilly evening but they had tons of space heaters so we were more than comfortable. We also had a fantastic waiter who was just all around pleasant and quick. 

Our waiter recommended the El Don margarita since he said it was a popular option, so our entire group went with that. It was strong but delicious! 

My sister's finance HIGHLY recommended the Chiles En Nogada and to be honest I may not have picked it off the description alone since I didn't know what to expect. It was absolutely amazing though. It was so incredibly different and the combination of chicken, apples, pears, dried apricots, golden raisins, walnuts, and onions served in a pepper and topped with almond slices, pomegranate and queso was just unbelievable. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Even just writing about it right now makes me wish I had this dish in front of me at this moment."}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and energy from coming to this wolf in sheep's clothing.  My wife wanted to come here on Saturday 5/12 because we made plans for Mothers day.  I don't mind waiting because usually if there is a wait it means a lot of people are drawn to the place for good reason.  However after our experience I must really question their motives.  We were seated outside and they sent us the least sociable server I've ever met.  It was like giving my order to a serving robot.  Beverages arrived 12-15 minutes later, server took our orders and then we played the waiting game again.  

My wife was really excited to visit this place being that she was born in Mexico city and grew up all over Mexico.  She saw the menu online and started to think about all the things she and her grandmother used to make in their kitchen.  The kids ordered an elote appetizer thinking it would be a glorified version of the street vendor variety.  What they got was a charred corn on the cob, flavorless and uninterested after 2 bites.  My wife ordered the queso fundido and to her shock they do not serve this with tortillas.  The server told us that the restaurant recommends you use the chips like we're at a hockey game ordering nachos for crying out loud.  I ordered the menudo, not quite enough add ins for my preference but slighly above average for the dish itself.  

Then the main courses came.  With our fingers crossed hoping these would save the day, we would be sorely disappointed once again.  My kids orders of carne asada tacos and the other with a hot dog left them with expressions that suggested they'd rather be at Filiberto's or Moreno's.  My wife's taco's arrived, she ordered the cochinita, en suadero and al pastor, each more flavorless than the last.  I have not seen her that disappointed since she got a C on a college exam, haha!  I had the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo and let me tell you this is the worst possible way in the world to spend $20 on an entree of overcooked shrimp and flavorless ingredients.  This dish has no imagination and is frankly an embarrassment to anyone that takes pride in Mexican cooking.  I still tipped the waiter well enough because the food taste was not on him and he did enough of what he needed to do to get us out."}
{"text":"Chips were REALLY hard & stale, elote had NO cheese, Mayo, or paprika, and lacked serious flavor, and the tacos were soggy and not correctly advertised. For $2.50/Taco (on Taco Tuesday & $3.50/ taco every other day) you get soggy, greasy, drippy, tiny street tacos! I couldn't even eat it without the entire insides falling out all over the place. So, essentially I paid $2.50 for 2 pieces of over grilled, under seasoned shrimp...don't understand why people rave about this place. The staff was REALLY friendly and attentive, that's about the only good thing I have to say."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced mexican/south west food in the heart of old scottsdale.  3 tacos $10 mix and match. Cool vibe and fun decor.  Fresh made margaritas!"}
{"text":"OMG I had such high hopes for this place and was nothing but disappointed!! The guacamole is way overpriced for the quality. Yes, it's table side and has fresh ingredients, but it was just not good. And salsa?? Mexican places are supposed to have amazing salsa and it honestly tasted like nothing, flat line, my taste buds were asleep and sad. The margarita that I got I'm pretty sure was made by the busser who had no idea how to make a margarita. The tacos were ok, nothing worth raving about, again with no flavors. It's sad because this place had such a good atmosphere and idea...but the idea failed starting with SALSA!!!!! 
Will never come back, but can say I tried."}
{"text":"I had the Barrio Pollo burrito very good and the guacamole was made fresh at the table with the added pomegranate seeds gives it a special tartness.  Ashley had the enchiladas de mole and it was super as well!  A great dinner, Wednesday we walked in and sat down within five minutes, but if you are planning to go there on the weekend prepare to wait, but the service is fast and they keep it moving. Quality products, quality service people a job well done!"}
{"text":"Server and staff friendly. Neat wall decor and atmosphere. Large menu. Long wait after we ordered on a Friday night. 

There's not a lot of flavor. Our table ordered a variety of dishes and there didn't seem to be a lot of flavor and no spicy to any of it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks last night with a couple of friends. I had the La Brava cocktail and it was absolutely amazing, made perfectly by the bartender. The bartender even gave us tequila infused jalapeños at no charge. He also gave us an option of an orange slice sprinkled with cinnamon to chase our tequila shots with. Never would have thought about trying that but it was delicious! Can't wait to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and polite welcoming staff.  We arrived for lunch and were promptly seated.  We asked to sit outside and even got to choose our table.   Ordered the 3 tacos for $10, beans, and house margarita.   Tacos are a little spendy, but the flavor and selection are worth it.   The house margarita is surprisingly delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Our expectations of this place were much higher than our experience once we got there. 

We got to our table and got our chips and salsa. The salsa wasn't hot at all.
My wife ordered shrimp tacos that only came with 2 shrimp in the taco, which we felt like it was kinda skimping it on the ingredients. 
I ordered the Arizona burrito which was just the burrito by itself for $15. Overpriced I would say, when you have to pay for all of the sides separately. 
My son ordered the enchiladas with only chicken and cheese and the tortillas were very hard.

I was told twice by the waitress that she would be right back with a new drink then never came back.

There were bees outside on the patio flying around our table, which may not have necessarily been their issue but it just added to the experience."}
{"text":"Please, somebody, get this place a manager!  4 hostesses that seem to do the work equivalent of 2...tons of people standing in the small entry (no chairs, waiting times over 20 minutes)...empty and available tables!!  They seem to be at a loss... especially on how to put a curtain on a window to keep the Western sun from pouring in and heating up customers! Come on man!
Food was the saviour for this slow paced restaurant ( not always a bad thing).  Drinks came quickly as did water/chips/salsa.  Very tastey and high quality ingredients, alot of yummy options.  Dessert was great too.  So we would go back, but maybe by pass the massive front staff and grab a seat at one of the bars"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really nice addition to the area. First time I've been there with my best friends we had a great time, we sat inside and although it was chilly evening. I recommend you guys go there because of great foods service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen gets a lot of suggestions from people here in the Phoenix area and the Old Town Scottsdale location is in a pretty area.  My favorite aspect of it is that the menu has a lot of options on it that one might see in a Mexican restaurant in Mexico.  Yes, there are the usual burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and salads - but also other dishes that are common on menus in Mexico and not just the Tex-Mex flair (but don't misunderstand me - I love Tex-Mex, it's just nice to have something different once in a while).  

I had the pollo milanesa.  It was the usual breaded boneless chicken breast but added a layer of chorizo to add a spicy element to it.  I quite enjoyed it.  My friend had a salad that she liked.  The portion sizes were generous.  The chips that came before were good and the salsa that was served was tasty.  

All in all, a nice treat in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ok.... Happy hour specials are awesome,

Margaritas are delicious...

The verde bowl was super good and came as a happy hour special. 

Love happy hour. 

I've eaten here several times and always ends happy, just like your local massage parlor."}
{"text":"Walked in nice place. Sat down they brought  us chips and salsa. Salsa needed a lot of flavor..it was like dipping my chip in water. My mother ordered 3 shrimp tacos and they all had 1 small shrimp in it. Horrible!My brother and I ordered menudo...couldn't  even eat it because it was way too spicey. Menudo has Chiles but this was like drinking habanero sauce spicy. We returned both Menudos. So he ordered the Suiza chicken enchiladas that are a whooping $15.50. The sauce on them was tangy and chicken was under cooked. I ordered two fish tacos and they each had 1 piece about 2 inches long. It was ridiculous! Then to make it worse..server was very slow and forgetful. Had to ask for things twice. We will never go back or recommend to anyone. Had the worst experience ever! If you want authentic Mexican food and not over priced just go to Morenos or Tia Rosas."}
{"text":"A gorgeous restaurant for sure! I could eat plates of their street corn! The tacos were good and my margarita was just a good classic margarita. I was a little disappointed in the salsa lacking much flavor but overall a great spot for lunch with a friend!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Live within walking distance, service is terrible and food is average."}
{"text":"It's good, but once you take  it into a franchise you lose the flavor of uniqueness. Nice atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is pretty cool.  Decent skinny margarita.  I ordered three tacos, carne asada, a pork one and a shrimp one.  Carne asada was slightly bland.  Shrimp was too spicy.  Pork was way too spicy, I couldn't even eat it.  When I had addressed the spiciness with my server, he gave me some sour cream to help but, all in all I was disappointed.  If you like spicy, then good for you but, I prefer to be able to taste my food not have my mouth burning."}
{"text":"Yummy and amazing! Juan our waiter was the best! The fresh chips and salsa were delicious, and this was our favorite meal while vacationing in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Was there on Saturday with Family after my daughters 2nd Bday party. I loved the atmosphere! Also you can't find a lot of places who serve Menudo the right way!! Also when is the last time you have been to an authentic Mexican food restaurant around our parts? (Besides the holes in the wall) well here you can dine in a beautiful area. I shared the Carne Asada Burrito with my fiancé. It was HUGE!!! It took two of us to eat it and he is never one to share. My daughter had chicken quesadilla which was sooooo good I ate half of hers! Yes they are a little pricey but you get great service, amazing food and it's clean and has a great atmosphere! Plan to go back their soon!"}
{"text":"Barrio queen is a fantastic experience and meal all at the same time. I had originally been to the original barrio cafe located off near 16th street and Thomas and very much enjoyed the signature pork (piblis). Barrio queen however, provides for a much roomier ambiance with a relaxed feel. The guacamole they prepare in front of you is some of the best I've ever had (pomegranates included). The horchata at barrio cafe, best I've ever had. This time around I ordered the Arizona burrito, a green chili pork burrito. The tomatillo salsa verde on top of the burrito was sweet with a medium to mild heat, very excellent, and the pork was packed with a lot of flavor. The chili it was slow cooked in didn't pour out and wasn't too runny either, each bite with the salsa verde and the green pork chili was a perfect combination. Had I not been entirely too stuffed, the house French roast coffee with chocolate patron and white chocolate Liquor would have been a must"}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay, but not super impressive. I was expecting a more authentic Mexican restaurant, but it was more of a modern spin on American Mexican food. We got chips and salsa which come out for free before your meal. Those are great, but the salsa is a bit spicier than I would expect for a salsa that is being given to everyone. The chips are also pretty hard and thick-not my favorite. We each ordered the street tacos, which were yummy but nothing to call home about. I thought the place was very overpriced for what it was, and we weren't even drinking! We will probably try it again to see if maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. But our first time was not impressive and I left feeling ripped off for what we got."}
{"text":"We have been there twice.  The food is amazing at this restaurant.  Very interesting dishes.  I highly recommend the Cochinita Pibil!  The noise level inside of the place is acceptable, but it is better outside.  We were happy with the service the first time, even though we had a change of waiter/waitress right from the beginning and it seemed like our first waiter didn't pass the drinks order to the next waitress, so we have to give her our order again, but after that it was smooth sailing.  During our second experience we were sorely disappointed.  Waited for ever for drinks, food, etc.  Our waiter barely checked on us and got refills only at the end of our meal.  We almost always order dessert, but decided to skip it to avoid waiting 30 minutes for it to be delivered to our table.  I want to give this place another chance because we really, really, really liked their food.  I just hope we get better service the next time."}
{"text":"I have gone to barrio café on a number of occasions and visited the location at sky harbor whenever I had the time so I was looking forward to trying barrio queen.. 

We left after being seated for 15 minutes and seeing a number of staff walk by our location and not even acknowledge us. No it will be one minute, no water, nothing... Horrible training on staff.. 

Needless to stay I will never visit any of their locations again or recommend them to any any friends or clients. 

My daughters gives them an F on service."}
{"text":"This was our 1st stop in Arizona (my 1st trip to here) , being from South Texas I was looking forward to some good Mexican Food and boy did we find it. The atmosphere of this restaurant is beautiful, casual, and relaxing. The staff is friendly,  quick, and courteous.  I had 2 skinny margaritas (I'm usually a beer girl) they were delicious!  Our food was beyond incredible I had enchiladas and my husband had Carne both plates came with black beans and grilled veggies . Let's just say we both wanted to lick our plated clean that how good it was. We will definitely recommend this place to anyone we know traveling to this area and we will definitely be back for more !"}
{"text":"I have visited this place 3 times and has not disappointed me. The pork ive tried there is sooo tender my Cuban husband loved it.

I would recommend the chiles en nogada, nachos chingones, and torta de cochinita pibil. I was not crazy about the cochinita pibil regular entree though.

I also loved the variety of tacos. Child friendly, my daughtet loved this place. The decor is so unique and I love the music they play. Not Mexican typical, and the food is probably not like you would think...they definitely have their own flair."}
{"text":"It's not the same green chili that it was. And who has to wait 24min before the chips & salsas comes. They took off the tequila drink they had three months ago. And this all happened with a dog on the patio that was not a service dog. Won't be back."}
{"text":"In my never ending search for local color when I travel, Barrio Queen kept coming up as a must-visit place here in the Phoenix area. Since this location was the closest to my hotel, I told Waze where to take me and off we went. 

The place was hoppin' for a Wednesday evening, but I spotted some empty two-toppers on the patio on the way in. I was quickly seated there and my server came by for the drink order. I selected a jalapeno margarita, skinny style; it was delivered fairly quickly along with chips and salsa. The margarita was as close to perfect as I've had in a long time; the skinny style really suits me, as it's much lighter on the sweet, leaving this one tart and a little spicy, and none of that neon green stuff. An excellent start to the meal. Chips were very, very good, and a bit unusual in that they were fairly thick, yet still delightfully crunchy and definitely quite golden brown. I should have asked for just a half basket :(

Moving on to the more substantial food, I chose the coctel de elote and the cochinita pibil. The elote was a generous portion, and was very, very good. It hit all the right notes in terms of ingredients, though I might have grilled the corn a bit longer and maybe had more lime. This are really nitpicks, though - it was delicious. 

The pibil was a VERY generous portion, and I had asked for mashed potatoes in lieu of Mexican rice. The black beans were good, not mushy at all, and seasoned well. The mashed potatoes had a nice garlic note, could have used a tad more salt, but in the end, I just ate them as-is. The pork, of course, was the real star of the show. Tender, perfectly shredded, well seasoned, it was an absolute delight to the palate. A little container of pico was provided, as were crunchy pickled onions on top. It was all very delicious. 

I realized after I left that I didn't receive the hand pressed corn tortillas, but I had had enough carbs for the evening with those chips, so I'll come back another time for those. Even with what was delivered, I took a substantial to-go box with me for lunch the next day. 

Atmosphere is really good here as well; the patio features misters that were mostly unobtrusive and definitely effective, and the lighting and furnishings were very nice. It would definitely be a good place for just a single diner like myself, or a group. Whether you're a resident or just passing through, you need to check this place out. It's outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Dakota the bartender is awesome!  He really knows his tequilas and the new Paloma is delicious."}
{"text":"Understand that some of the reviews may reflect the \"starting out\" bugs...but they have em fixed now I think!  Happy hour apps are fantastic and some of the best cheese fundito you will ever have.  Seriously,  the chef is the master of chorizo.  Four of us waited 35 minutes on a Thursday night..great margaritas also.  All shared plates and no complaints.  I have lived here two years and this (in my humble opinion) was the best Mexican food I have had!"}
{"text":"I was getting sick of Mexican food, because it was the same thing, beans, cheese, and rice but this place is awesome! It is truly the best Mexican food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Both food and service was mediocre. Our server didn't smile once, didn't make eye contact, and could careless about providing service to any of her tables. Food was overpriced and boring. Tried it and won't need to go back...ever."}
{"text":"Michelada!!!!  Michelada's are amazing here!!!  Guacamole is very good too!  The food that I ordered though, not so much.  The tacos were so tiny!! I really liked the atmosphere!  Cool vibe."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of TQLA.  The atmospheres are similar.  The pork wrapped in the banana leaf was delicious.  Chips and salsa were good.  There was just a strange vibe overall.  The service was ok, but nothing extraordinary.  

We went for dinner and waited 45 minutes for an ok dinner experience.  It may be a good place to go for drinks at the bar with some friends.

Nothing amazing to mention, and I may return sometime."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The restaurant was clean and colorful!!!! It wasn't your gimmicky Mexican food! 
The portion size was great and worth it! The food was flavorful! The service was fast as well. Next time I fly in from Chicago... I'll come back here!"}
{"text":"I went to Barrio Queen on New Years and I was very impressed. The manager made an effort to come to our table and inform us to think of the menu as \"sushi\". Strange--- I know, but it makes sense. The entrees are small and you can order one or two to start and then move on from there... The tacos are delicious! Its actually comforting, in my opinion, to go to a mexican restaurant and know that you are not going to be served these extreme portions nor leave stuffed and ready to explode.
If you like fish tacos, try the dos xx battered pescado tacos. So good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My friend and I came for AZ Restaurant Week last month and everything was so delicious, I couldn't wait to go back. When another friend of mine suggested Barrio Queen for my belated birthday lunch, i was super down! While I couldn't have their yummy margarita (boo work day), I wholeheartedly enjoyed everything I ate. 

The bean dip and chips they provide is solid. Then, of course, you have to order the guacamole! They'll make it as mild or spicy as you want and table side! Big chunks of avocado, freshly chopped peppers, pomegranate...SO GOOD!  My friend ordered the Pozole and seemed really happy with it. I ordered 3 tacos: the Cochinita Pibil (which they're known for), the Relleno, and the Camaron. I love me some shrimp tacos so the Camaron did not disappoint. The Relleno is pretty much carne asada with a roasted jalapeño at the bottom...spicy and fantastic! The Cochinita Pibil is marinated pork and it was so juicy and yom yom yom.

The customer service was also top notch. A woman (possibly the manager) came by and asked my friend if she wanted a to-go container for her Pozole. My friend said yes, but then our waiter came by and took her bowl. When the woman came back with the container, we realized he wasn't taking the bowl to transfer it to the container. The woman felt so bad she offered to have some more made to put in the container. My friend didn't want to put anyone out, so she politely declined. Then the woman offered her guacamole to go, to which she said YES! It was really so kind of her to go above and beyond like that for a simple mistake. 

Oh and they surprised me with the Flan for dessert for my birthday and it was BOMB.com. The sauce tasted like coffee...so good, so good."}
{"text":"What can I say?
This place is awesome
Two days in a row I bellied up to the trough with no regard for manners or appearances
( no verguenza )
I had a trifecta of Tacos Camerones or beer battered shrimp tacos 
Three for $10.00
If they weren't so incredible I might be prompted to try another dish next time 
But why should I?
The chips are made daily on premises as is the salsa
Halved limes and filtered water are served upon arrival
Delicious 
Yes ma'am!
I ain't ashamed
The Barrio Queen has my full attention"}
{"text":"Chris and Josh, great bartenders and friendly. Great tequila selection. Will go back. HOWEVER, the Mexican Cumbia music ALL the time gets tiresome. It's out of place.  Mix it up with salsa or Latin fusion music."}
{"text":"Called in an order of soup and was quoted 20 minutes on the phone. Waited and additional 15 minutes once I came to pick it up. 35 minutes for a to-go bowl of soup?? Kept being told it was almost ready as I waited. Seriously? What happened to this place? So disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Waitress was great, manager on duty ehh not too friendly for customer service venue"}
{"text":"The roasted elote is amazing!! Everything else I tried was okay, nothing special! But a good size portion for happy hour! Service is a little slow!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here! Green chili pork fries are delicious! $5 Casa margaritas are also amazing."}
{"text":"We met some friends here for dinner and were surprised at how hip downtown Gilbert has become! Barrio Queen was one of a few restaurants along this short stretch on Gilbert Road after the speed limit dropped to 25.

The place was busy on an early Sunday evening but our server was quick, patient (we had a lot of questions) and knowledgable. 

We all enjoyed the handmade at your table guacamole in all its chunky glory. I could see myself a regular here, but I cannot see myself visiting and not ordering the guacamole.

We each had different tacos and they were all delicious. I especially enjoyed the Huevo con Chorizo. Yup. An egg on the taco. I almost ordered two of these bad boys, but I'm glad I didn't. It was delicious and it is calling me to return even now, but it was also super filling. The spicy Barrio Pollo was an excellent balance, but there really wasn't a bad taco on the table. 

I debated between trying some tequila and the margarita and settled for the margarita. It was a fine margarita, but I kind of wish I'd gone with just tequila as they had a huge selection (though my wife would never allow me to have the $350 tequila...).

We will definitely be back, and Barrio Queen will be here a long time based on the quality and the crowd."}
{"text":"AWESOME. Started with the Carnitas en Chile Verde, next time I will just eat that, it was fantastic. Had 3 different tacos, all were great but the best was the Pescado Asado.

Really love this place - 5 STARS"}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, amazing salsa , wonderful food, but by far the worst bar service I have ever come across. Being a former owner of a bar in NY  and a bar manager for several years out here, I would be mortified if my bartenders didn't acknowledge customers when they sat down, or let them sit for 10-15 min without even a hello!! After I asked if I could get a drink I got one but then sat with it empty while bartenders talked among them selves or checked there phones. At this point can't blame the millennial, gotta blame management, as he was behind the bar and we had empty plates and drinks!!! Great salsa but get it to go...."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype. Cool decor, enthusiastic staff, but the food isn't great and it's overpriced."}
{"text":"For this if you locals that are Barrio Cafe lovers, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree here, despite a different ownership scenario.  Barrio Queen has great outdoor/patio seating, excellent chips/salsa/guacamole and excellent taco selections.  If you just want a margarita or beer to chase down an appetizer or a full meal for date night or a business meeting, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get sat properly. We walked in and asked for a table for two. Hostess was less than enthusiastic to be there let alone greet us. She took us to a tiny high top bar table. When we asked for a normal table/booth she said it would be 10 min even though there were several open tables available. She then said they were short staffed; a sure sign our bad experience wouldn't stop with the hostesses. Thanks Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"On a Positive Note:
By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in area!  Be sure to clear your calendar for Margarita Monday's, their Happy Hour it's fantastic!

The Downside:
The service is horrid!  We stopped in for Happy Hour at the bar and the bartender told us \" I'm going on break go sit at a table\"!  Needless to say we were shocked and after waiting15 mins for the hostess to try to clear us a table at 4:30pm we walked out."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good but the tacos where pretty dry.  Pulled park, fish, and Carna Asada.  The steak Taco was good but try something else instead of Tacos."}
{"text":"Food was great! I got the carne asada burrito and my with got the albondigas. Loved it. Great setting and location."}
{"text":"I luv this place. Best tacos in Scottsdale. The Marg's are fantastic too. Never disappointed when we come here especially when the weather is nice the patio is beautiful. Service is great too friendly  & quick"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Desert ridge. Service is rough due to the fact it's very busy since opened. Food is amazing and margs are very good. I will be back but not at traditional busy times."}
{"text":"The location is pretty rad and the food is pretty delish as well.  They always have a crowd so if you're on the urge to do some serious people watching you can definately do so here.  The outdoor seating is pretty spacious and the food and drink selection are pretty good as well.  The decor is pretty neat as well but the overall setup of the restaurant is odd but not bearing on this review.  The chips and salsa were spot on for a quick treat and the Menudo (served only on the weekends) was AWESOME!  Can't say that I usually go for that first off but it didn't disappoint.  The bar manager \"Lost\" (seriously his name) was primo and super helpful in describing what were key items on the menu along with suggesting some great pairings.  I'll definitely be back for more action!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about the Barrio Queen! I take friends, family and clients to this amazing restaurant. Great people, service, food, culture!! Please come and open in a place we have for you in downtown Mesa!! Next to the Rail, plenty of people and parking.  Beautiful location, across the Mesa Arts Center. Show us some love like you did in Gilbert!! :-)"}
{"text":"Great food horrible service and even horrible management. We were so excited that we found a great resturant but quickly learned the establishment does not know how to handle larger parties what so ever. The management is so poor and not customer focused. We called in advance and they don't take reservations what so ever no matter how big the party so we showed up extra early.  They couldnt seat us till 1/2 the party was there. Ok we get that I guess. We had a party of 15 and they sat 10 at a high top round table and 5 at another table that was a normal size so it felt like a kids table and completely excluded from the rest of the party. The other table literally had their backs to the rest if the party.  Big no no in the industry. Then the management tried to make excuses and pass it off like it was acceptable. We all know that is not acceptable and never in my life have I seen a party be separated like that. It took us 20 min to get drinks and when the manager came over to fill our water cups for the first time we were finishing our food and she had the worse attitude towards everyone like we were such an inconvenience to her. We will never go there again and we will never recommend this place for dinner again."}
{"text":"Okay I just have to say we have been to Barrio Queen many times. This evening was the best experience  ever!!  We were fortunate enough to have \"Angel \" as our waiter and from the minute we sat down until we left he was more then accommodating . Best service we have ever had there. Angel actually shows that he loves his job. Just a friendly hard working man that deserves the best I.n Life. This Resturant is lucky to have him. We enjoyed him so much both managers were pulled aside to talk to . Sure hope they take care of this great guy! Have to add his accent added so much and made us feel like we were  in Mexico . Great job Angel . Thank you for making our date night great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight. Our server was kind and our drinks were never empty.

I ordered the three tacos and my husband had the torta. Ambiance was nice and I really liked the free chips and salsa they brought to the table."}
{"text":"Great authentic food set at the bar. Fantastic margaritas. Shrimp tacos were delish. Of course chips and guacamole. Bartender was helpful. Clean place. Busy. You might have to wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The food is fast and 100% authentic.  The inside of the restaurant makes you feel like you have taken a short flight to Mexico for food and drinks. The paintings are top notch and music is great."}
{"text":"Taco's and guacamole are delicious.  Service is very slow although we stopped in and had Brandon as our server and he was great!!  If they could work on service this place would be wonderful.  We complained to the evening manager that we had waited quite a while to be greeted and he basically said \"we are busy\".  Try to look past the service and just enjoy the food.  Salmon & Shrimp Tacos are crazy good!"}
{"text":"Great service, chicken soup was very good and the tacos rocked. Chile relano was awesome too! Great food will return."}
{"text":"First time trying Barrio Queen.. and I'm so glad I did.. their jalapeño margarita was absolutely delicious. My friend and I had the table side Guacamole and shrimp ceviche for an appetizer. You can taste the fresh ingredients they used for both of the appetizers. I had the chilies en nogada.. this was a pablano pepper stuffed with chicken and other taste ingredients which I very much enjoyed. For dessert we split the chocolate cake with ice cream. If you are a chocolate lover I would recommend it. The best part of my experience is the staff. They greeted you with a warm smile. My waiter Matthew was extremely upbeat, friendly, professional and enjoyable to talk to. He was always prompt with our order. He was great at recommending what to get. I recommend if you go to ask to be seated in Matthew's section. Over all wonderful experience and an inviting atmosphere..I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. I hope it stays in business. The salsa is by far the best I've ever had, and I love bringing out of town guests here for its local modern vibe."}
{"text":"Good enough.  But, this place has the same big franchise feel like a P.F. Chang's.   Just like you get decent Americanized Asian food at P.F. Chang's, you will get decent Americanized Mexican food at Barrio Queen.    If you have to go to a franchise place, at least go to a GOOD franchise place - like Chang's or Barrio Queen.   Not the best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix, but definitely good enough!"}
{"text":"Table side guacamole?  Oh yeah.  The addition of pomegranate was different but very nice.  I got medium spice but wished I has said spicy.  Chicken Mole was not the best I've had but still very good.  Tacos?  Oh yeah...mix & match baby!  I got the second most expensive margarita and it was better than my wife's most expensive margarita...so I had two!  Outside seating was nice.  Be forewarned...NO RESERVATIONS.  We had no trouble getting a table for 4 though the place was plenty busy.  Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went on the Sunday before Labor Day.  It was still very busy so our party of 4 waited at the bar about 1/2 hour.  The service at the bar was slow, but once we were seated, our server was great and very responsive with excellent recommendations for both drinks and food.
I read some reviews that it was too expensive, but I felt that for the brand and for the food we were served, the pricing was within my expectations."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. Beautiful patio and a great atmosphere. Our server was knowledgeable and all of the staff were friendly. Margaritas were fantastic!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5 p.m. on February 22nd 20000 and 18 we waited approximately 35 minutes for a table and then we waited another approximately 45 minutes to an hour before our entrees arrived upon tasting these said entrees all we ask for a check in our boxes and we left it was Stone Cold absolutely no seasoning whatsoever I have eaten in Mexico City and this is not it it was Bland the freaking Suiza chicken enchiladas from the frozen section in the grocery store for the dollar 10 for $10 are better food than I ate at burial Queen I will never go again will never say anything good about it"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on a Taco Tuesday after work. We made it just in time for happy hour and decided to sit outside on the patio. (It had rained earlier that day so it was really nice out.) To start with, we ordered a half order of guacamole and two house margaritas. Since it was Taco Tuesday, all tacos were $2.50 (normally they are $3.50). There are tons of taco options and range from exotic to traditional. My husband ordered the crispy fish, Barrio Pollo, and Suadero Azteca whereas I ordered the Barrio Pollo and Chorizo, crispy shrimp, and carne asada. 

Our guac and drinks arrived first. The guacamole was good (it had dried cranberries in it) but nothing to write home about. The house margaritas were really good - fresh lime really made all the taste difference. Almost as soon as we finished the guac, our tacos arrived. We dug in eagerly and were soon in taco heaven. Crispy fish taco was similar to other ones we've had, ditto on the shrimp. What really stood out were the Pollo tacos - regular and with chorizo. The chicken was marinated in a delicious sauce that was really addictive. 

We overhead a waiter telling another couple that he eats the pollo tacos five days and week and if he left Barrio Queen on bad terms, he'd wear a disguise just so he could come back and eat the pollo tacos. My husband and I totally agreed - we agreed so much we ordered another round of pollo tacos (two apiece) to satisfy our addiction. During the second taco round, I ordered a Limon Y Coco margarita. (Coconut tequila with lime.) Oh my... this was the best margarita I've ever had. It was delicious. Even my husband agreed and tried to steal my drink. We both can't wait to come back for more pollo tacos and coconut margaritas. Watch out!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen catered a wedding for a close family member and the food was fantastic. Many different choices in meets, different types of beans, rice, salsa, build your own tacos with guacamole and various toppings. I was very impressed with the set-up and spread, and the food was very tasty. A little on the spicy side, but not too spicy. Tons of flavor. It made us visit the restaurant where the table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds is a must-have. The food is not really for people who don't do spicy, just FYI."}
{"text":"Lots of potential. A good location and a comfortable patio. The bar has very limited seating so the patio is the place to mingle. On the positive side, the menu is original and edgy. There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from. Portion sizes are small (think 3 bites per taco) so be adventurous & try several things you wouldn't normally order.

Service is the weak link here. Believe what you see in all the reviews - the wait staff & kitchen aren't ready for customers yet. I was there on a Monday afternoon at 3pm. Plenty of open seating on the taceria side and plenty of staff. Everyone was friendly and made me feel welcome .....but too many mistakes to overlook. Knowledge of the menu needs to go beyond pronunciation. I look for the servers to have tasted the menu & be able to give helpful insight. Not happening yet. No offer for water, simple margarita took several reminders & still came out after my second taco order. The marg still came out before silverware & a napkin which I requested 3 times.

On a positive note, the staff brought me an extra taco & later an extra margarita - explaining that both were over-runs that would go to waste. I think they just felt bad for dropping a few balls. I will definitely be back but i am going to give them some time to work the issues out. In the mean time, Canteen off Mill Ave in Tempe is a good alternative for a taco & tequila fix with good people watching."}
{"text":"Second try here and we had exceptional service. Margarita was very good. Food was served hot and the rice and charro beans were great. We each had the street tacos and they were all great. Nice to be able to mix up the different meats and seafood."}
{"text":"Not the best experience.  Arrived at 5:10, seated immediately with a party of ten ( including 3 children).  Left as soon as we could get out at 7:25.  Server was very nice but that does not make up for the length of time it took to get our food.  7 plates of tacos and 3 baskets of chicken strips.  Food was decent but definitely not worth the time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I'll start with the good. Love the decor, patio and overall vibe. It gets pretty packed but service was fast. The margaritas were great. The chips and salsa were ehhhh overall I feel the food was very bland and generic for Mexican food. I was disappointed with the steak enchiladas and black beans. Just not the rich flavorful food I expect from Mexican food.  It was like \"white washed mexican food\". I will probably go back and try something else. As I don't think this a one and done spot maybe I'll have tacos next time."}
{"text":"I don't even right reviews but felt compelled as the food was so bad that I felt like I got robbed.   Will never go here again and suggest no one does.   It's basically a fancy Taco Bell"}
{"text":"First off let me just talk about the elephant in the room here. Service. We have heard stories about the service at the Barrio Queen but let me tell you, our server was very knowledgeable, helpful and attentive... even standing in as a camera director for us! He also makes a mean guacamole!

This definitely is a must. must. try. item. The guacamole is hand-made at your table and by far the most surprising and delicious guac we have had. What makes it so special, the dried cranberries. Yep, you heard us. They are a sweet touch and made this guac a real stand-out. Our only regret was the chips, they are home-made as well, but a bit thick for our taste.

Next up, the tacos. If you love some street tacos, this is definitely the Happy Hour for you. With over 30 tacos listed on a check off sheet (similar to ordering sushi) there is certainly something for everyone here. The tacos are organized by category; chicken & seafood, pork, beef, vegetarian. For Happy Hour Barrio Queen selects two of the tacos and offers them at $3/2 tacos, which changes daily, the remainder of the tacos vary in price from $2.50 - $4.50. Happy Hour runs daily from 2 - 7 pm every day but Monday (they are closed on Monday for the summer months).

{"text":"Barrio Queen has been open, now, long enough to have worked out the bugs.  The food at lunch was fantastic.  The street tacos are fresh and flavorful.  Everything is cooked to order - even the tortillas.  The service is fun and friendly.  There are two sections to the restaurant - casual and a bit upscale.  Try one side one day and the other section the next.  Absolutely up to the standards of Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"Ok, last day of school and kids wanted MX, so we wanted to try the new place in town.  Let say, they are still in start up phase. The  service was poor, slow and literary my empty tea class sat empty the entire time, while server after server, Chip guy, managers walk by and nothing, Will not be back anytime soon. Thank goodness joyride is right down the street"}
{"text":"We didn't have the greatest experience the first time but Barrio Queen gave us another opportunity to come try the food again and it was amazing! I had the carne asada burrito and my fiance had the Azteca enchiladas and both were fantastic. The waitress, Kim, was fast and treated us as family. We will be coming back again! Thank you,  Katie!"}
{"text":"I am basing this review on 1 visit. The service was pretty good. The atmosphere was pretty good. The food.......Let me start out by saying I am picky about Mexican food.  I grew up in a very Hispanic neighborhood. I know good Mexican food. While the salsa was very tasty, the chips weren't my favorite. The were very thick and a little greasy. My wife ordered the Carne Asada burrito. I tasted it and thought it was pretty good. They do however use whole black beans. Refried beans aren't even on the menu. By now you may be wondering why 4 stars.......The Arizona burrito is the absolute bomb!!! It was one of the best green chili burros I have ever had. It was not too spicy, but the flavor was phenomenal. I hope that was not a fluke because I have been craving it ever since."}
{"text":"Great tacos and good price. Service is decent and the chips are top notch. Great atmosphere.  Check it out"}
{"text":"One of my favorite mexican restaurants in the area. I bring lots of out of towners here when they come through. The carnitas entre is excellent. Guacamole tableside is another must order. 

The reason I dont give it 5 stars is the service. It gets super crowded and it can take a little while for things to get moving. Last time I was there (this only happened once) we had to flag the hostess to even get a waitress. While this has not been my experience every time, it sometimes is a little slower than I'd prefer. But to be clear, this is NOT a barrier to going. Food more than makes up for it if its a little slow!!"}
{"text":"came here for taco tuesday, sat outside on the patio. Ordred 3 tacos. Rajas, al pastor and i had the waiter order the 3rd one and it was a chicken type but dont remember the name.. all 3 tasted great. service was great, chips and salsa was great, will be back. love the tequila menu also but of course pricey"}
{"text":"Nothing special here folks! The range of vegetarian options is very limited. I ordered a veggie taco, and it ended up tasting more like a salad :( However, the fries and the churro really saved the meal! They were spectacular :) Additionally, the overall vibes of this place are very calming and pleasing! If i could I'd give this place a 3.5 instead of a 3! Definitely not the best mexican food I've had but definitely not the worst!"}
{"text":"Came here with some of our friends as we had never tried it before. The food was absolutely tasty. The service, however, was sub par. Our waitress checked on us right when the food was dropped off (before we had taken a bite) but never checked on us again. Also, the guacamole should have had at least two avocados for $14!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant right off the river walk. The menu is extensive with plenty of choices of authentic Mexican fare. I ordered the casa margarita and WOW! it was so tasty! Even my mother who rarely ever drinks ordered one after trying mine. Service was friendly and prompt. I totally get why this place gets so packed with people!"}
{"text":"Delicious chips and salsa, table side guacamole, and carne asada platter.  The white sangria was yummy too. My husband's pulled pork tacos were a bit too soggy for his liking, but other than that, we enjoyed our meal. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, food presentation was good, and the service was okay. I wouldn't say I was impressed by the actual taste of the food. Favorite part about the meal was the mango agua fresca and the chips."}
{"text":"Would of been better if the  un smiling waitress   (  N orman ) was more kinder Food Was tasty  best Tasting Mexican food around"}
{"text":"We have been to Barrio Queen for lunch and sat on the patio outside and dinner and sat inside. We love this place. The Guacamole is an absolute must as its the best we have ever had anywhere. Check it out if your ever in the desert ridge area."}
{"text":"The location is great and the outdoor seating is spectacular, but the food is typical and service unpersonal. I feel like they are very comfortable, established and don't try real hard. I like their Tuesday taco special, but none of the other dishes I have tried really impress me.  The Mission is much better food."}
{"text":"Took a client out to try BQ for lunch today. At best the food was ok and a bit pricy for lunch. Had to sit at the bar as the staff couldn't clean tables fast enough to find us one. With one manger two hostesses and five wait staff couldn't understand that one. Might be a cool place to take out of towers but won't be back on any regular bases."}
{"text":"Where to begin, there's just so much wrong with this place. First, I must say we had a sweet little girl as our waitress.  She wondered around a lot. Apparently they took the advice of the other yelpers and added more wait staff.  Wrong. There are tons of wait staff......the kitchen needs help.  Big help.  Your tortillas at the table are thick  powdery  blah.  Yuck is the only word to describe them.  Buy some bagged ones, yours are awful .  And your salsa??  Is that what that was.  Chunky water, that's what it was, tasteless pulp.  I'm a crappy cook and mine is better!  Let's move on to the 10 dollar appetizer.  
The first one that came out was cold, the waiter said to Watch  out cause it was hot.  Hahah. Dream on buddy.  Slow cooked pork in coka cola with cheese, bunches of unmelted cheese. And Luke warm fat. We sent it back, they scrapped the cheese off and brought it back. A little pile of tasteless slow cooked fat, no cheese, no flavor. Come on dude, my pork in a crock pot kills this crap and I can't cook.  We took it home. My dogs took a bite, got bored and fell asleep.  Then came the main coarse.  A fish taco and a shredded beef. 3 for 10 2 for  seven  .  They were maybe 3 inch tops! Fish taco ...ok. Pork thing was half the size after I took off the layers  of nasty fat. This isn't hand pulled, it's just slow cooked until mushy.  My husband had what sound good on paper. Enchilada Stuffed..... Let's stop here, the olives and stuff were on top, what was inside was Luke warm cheese.  One of those things that the more you chew the bigger it gets.  Oh, and slow!  We had 3 refills waiting for our cold food.    People! Fix you oven!  It's not working.  All in all I'd say.....l want my Saturday back!"}
{"text":"I seriously can't go to this place for just one basket of chips! I typically like California style Mexican food but this place hits the spot every damn time! Wether it's for tacos or(and) Margaritas! A recent new favorite is the breakfast burrito. Such a simple burrito but oh so delicious."}
{"text":"This place was a blur, less because of the cocktails but more because it was loud and we had multiple convos going at our table. However, I do recall that the service was great, as were my 3 tacos! If you're looking for a quick bite, fair prices and decent Mexican, it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Tacos Tacos Taco Tuesday @ Barrio Queen . Best chips I've ever had! Enjoyed  our evening on the outdoor patio on taco Tuesday at Barrio Queen old town scottsdale . We started with table side guacamole , salsa,& the best chips! Then sampled 10 different unique tacos including a chili relleno & carne spicy combo . The indoor theme was kool murals of lowriders, dia day Los Muertos calaverna theme fun atmosphere . The music was enjoyable too, small bar Area with sports. Bien bien!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Barrio Queen at Desert Ridge with a group of 11 yesterday and enjoyed my lunch and the atmosphere.  We ate outside and the servers were so accommodating moving umbrellas around to shade us.

The food was very good.  Salsa was just right and the tortilla chips were warm went brought out.  I had fish tacos and there were very tasty.

Our server, Tanner, was the best.  He got all of our orders correct and was vigilant about filling the salsa, chips and water.  

Nice experience."}
{"text":"This was a really disappointing visit. I've been multiple times and whereas the food is fantastic, the service has been terrible almost every time. I don't know why and it's such a shame because the food really is that great that I will continue to visit but I will keep low expectations. Almost every time I have received slow, unresponsive, and generally awkward servers. Maybe I've been unlucky during my visits, especially after seeing others reviews, so I will try again but will keep my service expectations low."}
{"text":"Terrible carne Asada and al pastor tacos. Do NOT order those. I understand creative freedom of the cuisine well but for 3 tacos, come on. The carne Asada was terrible, cold and no flavor. I think they forgot that salt and pepper existed... Minimalist Challenge? Let's not start on the diluted salsa verde that came with the tacos...it would make a baby cry of disappointment. 

How can you not get a taco right at a Mexican restaurant. Thank Goodness I opted for the $3 overpriced rice. So a $16 bill for an unsatisfied customer in disbelief. Sad because we can't blame the service on the lack of cooking when it comes to tipping."}
{"text":"Fun eclectic restaurant great Mexican food nachos were really good and a must try. Sangria was good happy hour margaritas were good. Make sure you ask if pork is on any of the dishes that you order because they will throw chirizo on it. Servers are good but check your bill when it comes to make sure all items are accounted for correctly as we found some mistakes."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I decided to go to a different Mexican restaurant every week for Taco Tuesday. We tried Barrio Queen and it is now my hands down F A V O R I T E!! Their table side guacamole is amazing. Their service is quick and friendly. They have a large selection of tacos and I have tried almost all of them by now, they are all great! I brought my sister who actually lived in Mexico for a long time and she said their food was very authentic. You may have a short wait when you go but it's worth it! See you next Tuesday, Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"I am giving two stars based on ambience and the chairs being comfortable as those were ghee only two things we enjoyed.  My husband ordered a drink with upgraded tequila and was charged an additional $4 for it. Its not that the additional charge is an issue its that a shot of the upgraded tequila was the same as a shot of the tequila that came with the regular margarita... the math is just off here.

We ordered entrees and appetizers of which the appetizers came out about one minute prior to the entrees. I saw this happen to other tables around me as well so this is their normal process.  Makes me wonder if the food just isn't sitting there in the back ready to go waiting for an order? All of which would have been forgiven if any of it was good.  The food is SUPER oily.  My husband's shrimp dish had a layer of oil on the plate. Why? There is also just a lack of flavor. The Chili Verde is mediocre, rice and beans are boring,  salsas were uninspired and the chips are oily. 

We left feeling completely unsatisfied with the entire thing.  Please only go to order drinks at the bar as the ambiance is good enough for that but only that."}
{"text":"Great  fish tacos, very fast service,   loved the homemade chips and salsa.   I had  2 fish and 1 shrimp taco  they were very flavorful  .and very nice decor, great sugar skull art work on the walls.  Parking was good too,  nice big parking lot just north of it and very short walk.  I will  be back soon."}
{"text":"After my last review, it was refreshing to see someone from Barrio Queen reach out to make sure we had a better experience. They sent me a $25 gift card and my wife and went back for a lunch date today. We both ordered the Steak Salad and we both enjoyed it. I actually ate all of mine and finished what she didn't eat of hers. The server was excellent as well and checked in on us several times. We may have to give happy hour another go sometime when I am craving a margarita."}
{"text":"Last time coming in ... this was literally the third time I've been here and was let down.  Server didn't want to be bothered and could care less, food was cold, mediocre flavor.  For a bill that cost $70 it should be better.  Adios Barrio Queen. Should've gone to LoLo's."}
{"text":"It appears that the service kinks have been worked out as our server was very attentive and the food came out quickly. Guacamole was tasty and fun and tacos were innovative and delicious. I don't want to argue the point of whether Barrio Queen aspires to be authentic street food or Mexican fusion, consensus at our table was that it's a bit of both and the experience was so pleasant that honestly we don't care and we will return soon.  Of note, automatic chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal would be a nice touch and more opportunities to add serious heat (habanero, serrano, jalapeno) would have been a wonderful adjunct."}
{"text":"Dani is the best bartender !!  She always greets us with a warm smile and makes sure we are treated like royalty ."}
{"text":"I'm in love.. I'd be here at least weekly if I lived in AZ! Most Mexican restaurants disappoint me but I've been reminded how good the food can be.. I'm already missing the carne asada!"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on Friday and we sat on the patio under the shade of a mesquite. Our server was Maya who was quite pleasant and very efficient for her young age. I had the pork Tinga stuffed Chile ancho which was very good, my wife had a quesadilla which she said was quite tasty. We will return in the near future."}
{"text":"Mini ole home days with buffalo ny people! Food was fresh that's for sure! Tacos are pretty small, order the \"3-fer\" and that will fill you up plus you get a variety. Service was slow however. So if you have a lot of time , it's okay but place."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican culture and food like I do, this place is for you! 
The walls are adorned with \"Dia de los Muertos\" sugar skulls, the drinks are overflowing with tequila, and the burritos are enough to feed three people.
Plan on waiting a long time if you're going on a busy night, but there's a large patio with drinks.
The  Caldo Tlalpeno is AMAZING. I can't wait to be sick, so I can go in for a big bowl.
The tacos are small, so if you're not too hungry, this is the perfect bite at the right price. Try the Cochinota Pibil.
Like I said, I you're really hungry, get a burrito. The Arizona burrito has a great green Chile pork!
I LOVE sweet, fruity drinks, and the Toloache is a slam dunk."}
{"text":"For me, this place is more like 2.5 stars. We've been twice, the food is OK, but not amazing. The kicker for me last time was the \"table side guac.\" The waiter through it together in 60 seconds, we continued to add lime to it and honestly mine is much better, for $10.75 I would never order it again. There is much better Mexican out there, but you can't beat the location."}
{"text":"The street tacos are a little small (3 for $10) but for one dollar more, you can get a nice big burrito that will fill you up. I love the atmosphere and location. It's a great mexican place and it's very affordable considering it's in downtown."}
{"text":"I really like this place in some respects, but not in others.  

I love the location...kinda.  It's just off the water..and would be great on the water.  The patio is comfy but nothing memorable.  Don't get me wrong...it's not bad.  But not 5 star worthy.

The service was great when we were there and it's always been great for me.  No complaints there.  I was joking that if you need to see the waitress for something, just drink all your water.  She was so efficient at filling water, I didn't remember seeing her most of the time. And I go through a lot of water.

Table side guac is the best.  Love the twist of the pomegranate arils. Other than that, it's basic but that's the best kind.  We also got nachos for an app.  Ok...don't expect a pile of goop all over your chips.  It was white cheese and I believe carnitas on top. May have been green chili on top?  Not exactly what most people think of as loaded nachos.

Fish tacos were just OK. A battered lump of fish.  Just not that interesting.

Three stars feels kinda like a slap after I say I love some things about Barrio Queen. I love old town in general I guess.  I'm trying to rate it as if it is not in old town.  I can't bring myself to give it 4 stars. It's not authentic Mexican food which is fine.  But it's just not memorable to me."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here as I have heard mixed reviews, I wanted to experience it for myself. I came with some friends and we were sat at a half booth half regular chairs type of table. 
Chips and salsa are complimentary here. Their chips were different than typical tortilla chips, so if you're in the mood for something different then try them out!! 
They do have kids menus FYI! 
They had a taco special where you got three for a discounted price. They do not however have combos where the beans and rice come with the tacos. Those are an extra charge of $3 for each side. Beans and rice are separate sides.
The portions are larger than normal, I was definitely full! 
Oh, I also had an amazing blueberry margarita drink in a tall glass! I don't remember exactly what it was called but it was amazing!! It was flavorful and just the right amount of sweetness.
I will probably come back here as it is in a convenient location! My drink was the best part :)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for afternoon cocktails! First time at the Desert Ridge location. The decor is beautiful, very Frieda Kahlo/Day of the Dead chic. 
We sat at the bar and the bartender was really attentive. We tried the jalapeno margarita, the skinny margarita, the ginger fever and el pepino loco (jalapeno cucumber). They were not only delicious, but beautifully garnished. They all had special cocktail glasses too. The jalapeno margarita was my favorite, but I'm obsessed with jalapeno, so I'm biased. 
I also tried the classic Sonoran dog (bacon wrapped hot dog). It was good, heavy on the mustard. I've had them before with pico de gallo, and I think I like that better. It comes with fries, and it's only $8.00, a bargain!"}
{"text":"Delicious Margaritas and the tacos are excellent! Love the fun vibe and friendly service!

Updated: came here with the fam, and we were seated at a table that was placed in a very busy walkway with high traffic next to the kitchen. My chair kept getting bumped by staff walking by, which was no fun. The waiter was not attentive and the food was lukewarm with small portions, overpriced in my opinion. We waited over 40 minutes for our food, and since our waiter was so focused on pushing his cart of guacamole around to other tables (apparently they make it table-side? It would have been cool if offered to us), we were not able to get drink refills. My last review was based off of my experience when it was just me and a friend visiting. This review is from when I visited with my family (kids included). My conclusion based off of my experiences is that this restaurant is happy to serve drinks and apps to a table of two, but being family friendly is not their preference. I don't recommend coming here if you have your kiddos with you."}
{"text":"WOW !!!!!!!!!!!! Talk about Amazing food and good prices . Try the Coconut Tequila Margareta."}
{"text":"Food was just okay and rather bland. The concept and menu is great they're just lacking in their execution and flavor. I got the carne asada, pastor, and rajas tacos - if I am going to spend over $3 each for a street taco I would expect great flavor. There are a ton of great places nearby, I would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Three of my friends and I went in to Barrio Queen as an in between before our next destination one night. The place was pretty slow and it was a perfect night so we sat on the patio. Our server came to greet us pretty quickly but I take it that might have to do with the fact that we were one of three tables outside. In any case, he was very attentive throughout the hour or so we were there.

We ordered four drinks that were a little pricy but worth every cent. They were amazing! This was a few weeks ago so I can't quite remember exactly the names but they were delicious. Fresh ingredients and a good amount of booze. 

The server made the guacamole table side and it was awesome. Figs, fresh avocado, apricot, chives, tomato among other ingredients made an awesome end result. 

I give it a 4 star review because even though we didn't have a full meal, given what we did have when we were there, everything was great. I'll definitely have to give it another go around for dinner just to solidify the rating as I have a tendency to be very forgiving. :)"}
{"text":"A month ago I met a friend on a Saturday at this place. It was an hour wait, that's ok we will check something else out.  Yesterday we tried again. We got sat down on the patio.  We had 5 servers walk by us and didn't even offer water. After 10 minutes never being acknowledge we walked out.  On our way out the hostess was chatting with another employee.   I told them both about nobody coming by our table so we were leaving.   All we got was ok, no offer to find our waiter, nothing and she went back to chatting to the other employee.   Very disappointed.  I am not sure I will attempt a third time.  Too many other restaurants to spend my money at."}
{"text":"At first, I thought \"oh no it's a place for suburban families to eat \"semi-authentic\" Mexican cuisine\". 
First of all, let me tell you the food is exquisite. The tortillas are thick, the music is mixed with old and new Cumbia Sonidera adds to the ambiance. 
This is what I ordered:
*Appetizer- Queso fundido; queso Oaxaca, with crispy Chorizo served with chips and medium spicy salsa.
*Three red chile enchiladas with savory black beans and calabasitas mixed with corn.
*Drinks- Horchata topped with cinnamon served on ice."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and he place was crazy busy! Good for them! We still had Great service! I ordered the Sonoran dog (amazingly authentic) and my husband had the carne asada entre which was also amazing and huge!"}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as Barrio Cafe.  Had the Pollo burrito w Chorizo.  Simply average.  Chips were great.
If you have the time go to Barrio Cafe in Phoenix.  It's awesome.  If you are from out of town definitely be sure to get to the one in Phoenix(it's the original.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the staff especially the bartender desi who recommended green chili pork verde tacos \"outstanding\". If you want great southwest food with impeccable service try this new location at desert ridge."}
{"text":"The food is yummy!!!! The service could have been better! Drinks are a little over priced for the amount of actual liquor in them"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Arizona and wanted Mexican food as I heard it was rather good on the west coast and in surrounding areas.

I liked this place. It's similar to a Dos Caminos but not as commercial and less expensive and just overall cooler. I love sugar skulls and authentic Mexican decor.  There are all kinds of knick knacks displayed that you can actually purchase.  The service was good, the food was good.  I ordered a variety of authentic tacos-not the typical taco bell meat cheese sour cream type.  Think more like fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, over roasted jalapeno and quesillo cheese relleno, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado or maybe spice rubbed chicken, caramelized onions and roasted poblano peppers in a spicy pinon cream sauce, topped with chorizo and cilantro.  

Bring Barrio Queen to the East Coast!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, nice staff..... Perhaps a little pricey, but worth it. The burritos are massive and delicious. My wife had Casa Margarita and I had the Paloma. Both outstanding. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed overall with this dining experience and would never return again. The restaurant was half empty but yet, there was a thirty minute wait for a table around 2pm. The hostess had a snarky attitude and sneered at me when I asked if my table was ready, as I was looking at a fully, set table right in front of me, as she sneered at me again and said I will seat you when your table is ready. I have to say, that a power hungry, teenager with bad attitudes should not hold the power to seat paying customers. The barmaid was just as snarky and rushed us as we ordered, and then got our order wrong. When we asked her to correct the order, we got nothing but attitude. Also, I prefer not to be served by restaurant workers with sleeve tattoos--just a personal preference of mine. As for the food, I ordered a chicken burrito for $11 and I didn't recognize the meat insider, it may have been pork, or poorly flavored dark meet, chicken. Also, the server looked at us as if we had three heads when we asked for chips and salsa, as offered by every other Mexican Restaurant in the world! They don't offer chips and salsa, but force $12 appetizers on starving customers that just waited over 30 minutes in the 85 degree heat!"}
{"text":"We came here a few months ago. The food was good. Presentation was good. It was not too busy. I believe we came in the middle of the afternoon after lunch.

The service was OK. It was nothing fantastic but it wasn't bad either. We read quite a few reviews and read the negative ones.  We decided to still try it and we're not disappointed.

Food was slightly pricey. But it wasn't too bad. The portions were good size. The restaurant has a friendly and inviting atmosphere. It's not like the Mexican food that you would get Garcias, rather more like some Mexican bistro. I like that everything was not topped with cheese.

Service could have been faster since there were not many people in the restaurant. I cannot imagine if there were a lot of people what service would be like. However we would come again."}
{"text":"Their tacos may be small and a bit pricey. But hey, that's what taco Tuesday is for.  The chicken taco with caramelized onions. omg! I must have more!"}
{"text":"Looking for good tacos? This is the place! I loved being able to choose different tacos and try what they had. My favorite is the barrio pollo with a side of rice. Get three and try different tacos. They also have other great options. My husband usually does a burrito and my sister loves the chicken soup. It is a fun place with bright and exciting decorations and murals and the outdoor patio is perfect for a nice ambiance during the week or weekend.  Our waitress, Whitley, was so nice and very helpful. We always made sure our drinks and chips were full and and that we had everything we needed. Their chips are also very good. They are thick and I think home made. I enjoy coming to barrio queen and spending time with family and friends while enjoying great food."}
{"text":"This is an annual stop for me and my ladies when we come to spring training, we probably come here three out of the five days that we are there. The staff is come to remember us throughout the years and always cytisine our same exact table making our guacamole in front of it. Judy, who was our waitress most of the time was incredible. Fred, always comes and puts a big smile and all of our faces whenever he sees us. We have an ongoing joke that they should just make that our table and put a plaque with our picture on it. We order the Don margarita and it does not disappoint-  the floating marnier is life! I highly suggest trying all of the tacos, they have really great taco specials. This year we decided to try the elotes fries- defintely shareable.

If ever in Scottsdale, do not pass this place up your correct it."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice with clients and the service is fantastic!  Its very Authentic and makes you feel like you are not in Old Town Scottsdale.....  The table side guac is outstanding and love Taco Tuesday!   Highly recommend this restaurant for large groups and the price is affortabale"}
{"text":"I ate out on the patio with a group of friends and the atmosphere was great. I ordered a few different tacos and liked them for the most part. My only complaint is that you don't get very much food for your money. But if you were to come during happy hour, the price per taco would be more justified."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday night. Lots of empty table but we were told it was a 20 minute wait. Instead we went to the bar that is in the dining room and we were the only ones at the bar. Weird.

Bartender was excellent and we had fast service. I ordered the Arizona Burrito - Very Tasty!. However... My friend ordered the 3 for $10 tacos. He asked how big they were and they said street taco size. 3 should do it. When they were served the tacos made us start laughing. The tortilla was about 3\" across. No kidding they were honestly one bite each. He did think they were great tasting though.We also ordered a tres leche desert. Very average.

One bloody maria, one soda, a burrito, 3 tiny tacos and a desert. $40 Plus tip. Won't be my first choice of places to return to but it is downtown Scottsdale...."}
{"text":"Was driving thru and saw \"Barrio Queen\" absolutely loved the sugar skull and had to stop! Our waitress Gisela was Fantastic! The Chile here is Fantastic! Thank you! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and portions are small. Taste is OK. Nothing great. For me a one time visit only. Drinks were OK. Nothing to rave out TBH"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen did not disappoint. The ambience, service, Mexican food and house margaritas are all are deserving of 5 stars. When the chef comes out to greet you and check if you are satisfied, you are definitely experiencing something unique. This restaurant lives by their motto, A TODA MADRE! Going back tomorrow to sample another flavor infused dish."}
{"text":"Terrific food, margaritas and guacamole. Best happy hour for a group. Mena's only stop in Scottsdale. Try the late night deals when you are stumbling around Old Town and hungry. Go!"}
{"text":"Oh, Barrio Queen.

The week prior, I had met up with a group of Yelpers for a farewell dinner at the Scottsdale location. 

Review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/barrio-queen-scottsdale?hrid=UANP8WNpEH6ID8O1ho19uw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct) 

tl;dr

Delicious food, Crazy Woman treated Dude and I like Criminals-To-Be based on appearances, did NOT want to go back to Barrio Queen anywhere. 

Missy F. was back in town from California, and suggested we meet here after her lifting session and my physical therapy appointment in South Gilbert. 

I grabbed the same outfit I wore in Scottsdale (navy and white striped 3 in shorts, black v-neck t-shirt, black wedges) to change into after PT, but more importantly to do a test of sorts to see if I encountered the same level of harassment. 

Missy had already grabbed a table, and informed me where she was. 

Told the hostess, and she told me I was welcome to find my friend. 

SUCK IT, SCOTTSDALE BARRIO QUEEN.
 
The food was delicious and service was above average. 

Missy had some tacos,and I was able to order the Carne Asada Burrito in the same style as the Carne Asada y Chile Relleno taco. 

Tender, delicious beef, perfectly spicy, and big enough for me to bring home the other half for  Dude to enjoy for dinner on his lunch break.

Next time a friend suggests Barrio Queen, I'll STRONGLY SUGGEST we hit up the Gilbert location.

Well done, team!"}
{"text":"At Barrio Queen, you'll find steep prices for delicious tacos. 

Oh, and if you're not dressed to impress like the local demographic, be prepared to get treated like a criminal-to-be. 

Dude and I were meeting up with a group of Yelpers for Name Twin Meghan L.'s sendoff before leaving warm, sunny Arizona for freezing tundra Wisconsin in June. 

We noticed that Brett B. had already checked in, so we assumed he and the Crew had already been seated. OK, no big deal, we'll go find where they're seated.

Upon arrival, we told the hostess that our group had already been seated and thought we were being polite by saving her some trouble and locating them ourselves. 

This woman was hot on our trail, following us with a sense of urgency that was borderline disgusting and completely insulting. 

Is it because we were in shorts and t-shirts and not in dress code? We were clean, showered and not sloppy looking. This is Phoenix Summer for Crissakes. 

Whatever, Brett B. and the Crew rolled up right as Crazy Woman herded us rough lookin' North Chandler Folk back to the front. 

Thoroughly miffed at this point, we got a table outside. 

Thankfully, our server was attentive and made up for Crazy Woman's (unacceptable) shenanigans. 

I forgot what kind of tequila was in the Skinny Chola Margarita, but it had me floored in minutes. 

I really enjoyed the chips and salsa here. Nothing too spicy, but an excellent flavor. 

Brett B. ordered some of the famous TEN DOLLAR, MADE FROM A SINGLE AVOCADO (per our server) Barrio Guacamole with pomegranate seeds that everyone raved about for us all to share. 

Uniquely tasty for sure, but based on price alone, I wouldn't order it again unless it were a group dining situation.

Dude and I both went with the 3 for $10 street tacos. 

I had the Cochinita Pibil (pork) Camaron Asado (grilled shrimp) and the Carne Asada y Chile Relleno tacos. 

I don't remember much about the Camaron Asado, but do remember the Chile Relleno one to be perfectly spicy. 

The Cochinita Pibil was the absolute winner of the night, marinated in some tangy yet sour orange juices and topped with orange pickled onions and pico de gallo. It made for the perfect variation in textures. 

Also, why aren't these tacos \"doubled corn tortilla-ed\" like typical street tacos? 

Get the Chipotle Mashed Potatoes for your side if you want to get away from the obligatory beans and rice. I can't speak for the Calabacitas, but Joycie Joyce Dubs' order looked great. 

While I enjoyed the ambiance, service, food and time with friends, I will NOT be returning to this location.

Why?

I met another friend at the Gilbert location the following week, where we were able to enjoy tacos and burritos sans harassment based on our appearances."}
{"text":"We went there about 8 on a Saturday night.  They do not accept reservations.  The young man in the red t shirt at the entry told us it would be an hour and a half wait, even though there were many empty tables.  He had a haughty, arrogant attitude, as if he was doing us a big favor letting us wait for a table. When we asked about a seat in the bar, he sort of waived a hand and said that they have a bar and maybe we could find a seat.    When we were finally seated, the food was ordinary at best.  I also dislike the decor.  The Mexican \"day of the dead\" festival does not make for a pleasant dining experience. 
Why do they not take reservations? The \"host\" was keeping the list on a small hand held computer.  Its the twenty first century people!  
So, if you enjoy being treated with contempt, being kept waiting a very long time, and Looking at corpses and skeletons while dining on mediocre over priced food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen was pretty good! First - adorable set up they have going on in Old Town. Can't believe this was my first time coming here! Had really great service so no complaints there! And the chips and salsa were on point. In addition, you can't beat their deal of 3 tacos for $10! However, in my opinion, I've had better tacos! I thought they were good, but they lacked something for me. I will be back to try the different ones they offer because some of their unique ones scared me off."}
{"text":"Experimented with some enchiladas, tacos and a Sonoran dog and left absolutely satisfied. Chips and salsa were perfect restaurant style. The cool artistic vibes throughout and 4:30 crowd makes for a pretty chill ambiance. Happy hour 7 days a week, with a Tommy's Margarita discretely disguised as a award-winning Skinny Chola so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on cinco de mayo 2017. I apology a little late on the review.

There was nooooo parking at all. Even if you wanted to pay. I ended up walking at least a mile in the heat to then had to sit outside in the heat even though we had a reservation. Way too hot. Outside seating way better at night.

Food is over priced, not that great and small portioned (I dont eat huge portions) I got a chicken caesar mexican salad because I was way too temperature hot to eat anything else. The yummiest part of the salad was the grilled chicken. 

My friend got a arizona burrito. She said it was alright. 

Overall I may have just been too hot but this restuarant wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I just called your restaurant to find out the Cinco De Mayo specials for this evening.... A female host answered the phone. I asked if you had specials she said yes we have drink and food specials.... I asked if she could list the specials and she hung up in my face.... I have called back 4 times and the phone has picked up and then the call ends. I called from my friends phone with a different area code and the same girl picks up the phone no problem! We asked to speak to a manager 5 TIMES and she said it wasn't possible and that they were too busy... Finally we just hung up....  I had just convinced my friend to go to Barrio Queen over Loco Patron for Cinco De Mayo!!! I literally was telling him how awesome this place was and how great the food was and you display this kind of service?? Thanks Guys! By the way I posted this exact same post on your Facebook under your Cinco De Mayo pictures you were posting.... The ones that actually made me want to come and enjoy your establishment..... Customer Service is the BASIC skill of any hostess or employee that deals with consumers... Maybe it's time to have a talk with yours."}
{"text":"Had the best meal here. Jen M made me the best guacamole. I had the Barrio pollo burrito which was recommended by Jen. Such a great experience. We will back soon."}
{"text":"I loved this place each time we ate in, but today it was $53 for a Doordash delivery of a tiny side of $14 guacamole that obviously wasn't made fresh and didn't have the right ingredients (I was so excited for the pomegranate, which wasn't there, and it was packed with onions, which I requested without) and tacos that weren't made correctly, and were filled with nothing but a big pile of cilantro and onions with very little dry meat. We would have eaten at the restaurant, but I'm too sick to go out and all I wanted was tacos...but this was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I came here on Taco Tuesday because it's one of the only places that I found that has a chorizo taco in Scottsdale. The tacos were really yummy the atmosphere is fun in hip. It's in an excellent location walking distance from all of Old Town. This is a great place to go after a long day of shopping!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad $11 paid $6 more to add chicken. The chicken was spicy and dry and cold. The salad was mediocre. The chips were too thick and tasteless. The salsa was passable. You cannot order a single serving of guacamole. You have to order $16 worth of guacamole that serves four people, which I did not do. It was my first and last time at Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"I would come here for cocktails, but that's about it. We came here because my husband had heard amazing things about the freshly-made guacamole.  A few things - a 45min to 1:30 wait? Ehh ok, fine. I ordered a pineapple agua fresca (refreshing!) and my husband ordered a Michelada (props for having these on the menu), but it took a while for me to get my drink. It would have been nice to be offered a water in the meantime - but our server was clearly very busy. We ordered the guacamole and while it and the salsa were good, the $10 price tag made it hard to swallow. The bartender finally ended up bringing my husband his beer as we were almost done with the guacamole. I ordered the Camaron Asado & Cochinita Pibil tacos, and my husband ordered 3 Camaron Asado tacos. At $3.50/taco, we were caught off guard when the shrimp tacos came out with literally ONE SHRIMP per taco. My husband asked the server, who confirmed with the manager, that yep - the shrimp tacos only come with one shrimp. HUGELY disappointing considering you can get delicious shrimp tacos that are full to overflowing at some of the small hole-in-the-wall Mexican places. The Pibil had good flavor and definitely a larger quantity, but still not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"We came here on Taco Tuesday during happy hour. $2.50 tacos & $4 margaritas, I'm there! We sat outside and the patio is very nice - good people watching. 

We got the table side guacamole, and for $10.75 it left a lot to be desired. She really didn't mash it up so it was extremely chunky and very hard to dip chips in - so we just mashed it up ourselves. It was also quite under seasoned, so it was more on the bland side. 

As for the tacos, I got the al pastor (pork with pineapple), carne Asada chorizo azul (beef with chorizo & blue cheese crumbles) and the Pescado (beer battered fish). The Pescado was definitely my favorite - perfectly crispy fish and great flavor. The other tacos were great as well, but JEEZ they are small. I can't believe they charge that much for such a small taco!! 

Nonetheless the food was pretty good for the most part, but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for those itty bitty tacos when there are a ton of other places you can go!"}
{"text":"Note: I've been a server for 5 years. 

So from an understanding perspective, I write to you with complete frustration.  I have been here 3 times- good has come cold every single time. So I send it back and it comes back COLD AGAIN! 

Once is an incident, twice is a pattern and three times is a habit. 

You are warned!"}
{"text":"Came here for my 21st birthday in February and loved it! Bartenders were extremely nice and welcoming and they made my birthday fun fell in LOVE with the chips and salsa. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My food was cold, we had to ask for chips. My husband had to ask for the tortillas that were supposed to come with his food, and when he finally got them his food was cold. Expensive and disappointing!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but they are some damn good tacos. The drinks are way over priced but overall great experience."}
{"text":"If you love authentic tacos, not just the ones from taco bell or filibertos, then you will love the taco menu at Barrio Queen.
The taco menu consists of 20 different types of street tacos to choose from. And you can try one of each if that is what you wish, or order all of the same kind. It's up to you, which is what I love about it. One of my favorite flavors includes the Salmon y Mango taco, with chilled chunks of smoked salmon, diced mango and pico de gallo, served on a tiny corn tortilla. Delicious! I also tried the Carne Asada taco with fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado., as well as the El Pastor taco with chile and spice marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, pineapple, and salsa borracho.

Tacos is not all they serve either. Their menu includes enchiladas, tortas, burritos, quesedillas, and more. Barrio Queen serves up some authentic Mexican flavors while adding in their own rendition of spices and other ingredients to stand out from the crowd.

If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to. Excellent food! And don't forget to order their Barrio signature guacamole made table side - chunks of fresh avocado, pomegranate seeds, diced red onion, and maybe one other ingredient I can't remember. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, drinks, and service!  I stopped here last week while exploring Scottsdale, and was so glad that I did!  I got seated immediately outside (low 60s was warm for me in December), and had a very friendly server who helped with some suggestions.

I went with a variety of three tacos - Cochinita Pibil, Camaron, and Carne Asada y Huevo.  All were very tasty, and the homemade chips & salsa were good too.  Of course I needed to wash it down with margarita, and that was excellent as well!  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"In a word....disapointing. The wife and I ate here for lunch and I was very, VERY excited. Not from the yelp reviews per se, but from the menu. You see, I love me a good taco, and with over 60 to choose from I was very pumped.

However, Barrio Queen just fell a little flat for us. We ordered the cochinita, the carnitas, milanesa reggie and chorizo y pollo. Of the 4, the chorizo y pollo was the best. The cochinita, while good, didn't quite hit it out of the park for me (I LOVE cochinita) the carnitas was super dry, the milanesa, which is breaded and crunchy, was also dry and lacking overall flavor. Good, but not great and not what I had hoped for.

Then we ordered the green chile beef and the tlacoyos. If you're unfamiliar with tlacoyos they are....well.....similar to arepas? Not really sure how to describe them but they are generally awesome and while these were OK it, again, wasn't what I was hoping for. Very little chicken with the dish and the tlacoyo's themselves (the little cakey/tortilla type thing on the bottom) wasn't substantial enough. But how was the green chile beef you ask? Salty. Very, very, salty. 

$37 bucks in all before tip just added to the disapointment. I really hope this place does well, and I do plan on coming back to try more of the tacos but overall...disapointed."}
{"text":"went there for lunch today, it took them at least 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 mins before we could order. 3 taco's for 10 dollars i thought it was ok but when it came they were small-more like street taco's. they were good but not worth the price. I wont be going back here any time soon!!! poor service!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for happy hour while I was visiting Scottsdale. They have fantastic drink and food specials for happy hour and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a good spot in the Old Town area.

Our food was pretty standard Mexican fare but nothing to write home about. They do make the guacamole table side but do not ask you what you'd like in it which pretty much defeats the purpose of table side guacamole in my opinion. I also tried the roasted elote and camaron taco. The taco was good but the elote was a touchy too spicy for me, not something you usually get from elote! 

The best part of Barrio Queen is the ambiance and the service. Both were spot on and made it a perfect place to relax for drinks and food. Just don't go here expecting gourmet Mexican fare."}
{"text":"The food was great but don't let them seat you outside in summer months. The so called fans did nothing and the shade umbrellas only helped a little. Misting system would help a lot at this place. Don't offer patio seating unless you can at least cool it a bit"}
{"text":"We had the green pozole and chile en nogada. The food was very good and it is very close the style of central Mexico. The service was excellent. I had to wait for my green pozole but our server let me know right away about the issue. The menu has dishes that are very authentic."}
{"text":"Great drinks - over priced!!! 3.50 for A shrimp taco! You read it right 1 shrimp in each taco!"}
{"text":"5th time here.  YES , order the table side guacamole For dinner I like the 3 tacos because you have so many options. My favorite entree is the Cochinita  Pibel. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food with a gourmet touch...Tortillas chips Are homemade and salsa is delicious incredible menu lots of selections ... 
Tableside Paloma was fun. Located in a cute area called old town in Scottsdale. Staff is quite nice and they have a lot of neat souvenirs to buy from the restaurant. Absolutely loved it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! We got here right after the kitchen closed and we're super bummed about it. About five minutes later the manger came out and said he would open the kitchen for us. Even though they were closing down they didn't rush us at all. The drinks and food were delicious! We will definitely be coming here again. And who doesn't like free chips and salsa?! :)"}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place! Kim was our server and she was amazing. The entire staff is extremely attentive and kind!! Food is incredible!!! Marissa the bartender rocks too! :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for the messy management and the inconvenience of being unable to make reservations(even when you're trying to plan a birthday). 

I asked my Bf where he wanted to go for his birthday and he responded \"The New Barrio Queen Desert Ridge!\" So what baby wants, baby gets.  After making the whole Facebook invitation and such I rounded up about 15 people and called Barrio Queen a week out for a reservation.. BAM \"we don't take reservations\". My heart broke.. i knew the day of the birthday dinner my whole day would have to be focused on extreme early arrival. 

So fast forward to the day of the gathering:  I arrived around 2PM(dinner was at 7:30p) to drop off a cake and some balloons and talked to the ladies in person.. still there was nothing they could do about any type of potential reservation. So I left and arrived back at 6:30 as they suggested(an hour prior to our desired seating time) and waited. As all of our guests arrived we noticed there was a nice smaller party/ banquet room off to the right and asked if we could just sit there. The room could probably seat like 45 people ok.. and there were a bunch of people waiting still also. So the employees said No and we continued to wait. By the one we reached 90 minutes of waiting, someone called my name... guess where they sat us?  Yep you guessed it, in that same room. It took forever for us to get chips, salsa and the first round of drinks but our server ended up being super awesome so it was ok.  I loved the food but the coordination was atrocious. I ordered shrimp tacos and the guacamole. I love the salsa and chips they serve and paired with a nice skinny chola marg is the best!

Barrio Queen: Please be a little more flexible with your customers and accept reservations for large parties... without us returning customers you wouldn't be in business. Otherwise, keep up the great food and ambiance, everything else was wonderful. See yo again soon!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were amazing. The guacamole and nachos are to die for. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Adrian was the rockstar of this busy evening! At least, I hope that was his name. He was actually the bartender who offered our party beverages while we waited for a table. After we were seated, we didn't see anyone for a quite awhile, but when he walked by, I jokingly asked him if he would be our server and he took us on and had a good sense of humor about it. 5 stars for service! The meal was very good. Our party tried a variety of dishes including the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Cochinita Pibil. There wasn't anything outstanding about the dishes, but they were well-executed. The best parts were, oddly enough, the black beans and the hand-pressed corn tortillas. The other two in our party seemed to really enjoy their tacos, so perhaps that's the stand-out dish here. I was just happy to see a local restaurant doing so well on a Wednesday evening and I'll definitely be back to try the tacos."}
{"text":"Love their food.  Love the atmosphere. The servers seem to do great. The kitchen can backup, so plan on longer service times."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us. I couldn't be more delighted. The food was beyond amazing. The service was great!! The waiter, Dustin (I think) totally knew the menu. His recommendations were perfect!   This is a must if you are  in Scottsdale! !"}
{"text":"I stopped by while bar hopping around Old Town. It was nothing special. On a separate note, I had tried their tacos during the food truck festival, and it was the best one. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to dine here before moving."}
{"text":"Meh.. I felt it was overpriced for food smothered in cheese. I am a cheese lover, but it over-flavored the rest of the ingredients, including the mole sauce. I was getting big bites of cheese rather than chicken. Not for me.

Also ordered a quesadilla kids meal for my almost 2 yr old son, came with a drink and I asked for milk instead of soda. They charged me for it when I got the bill, but they said they'd \"cover\" it when I brought it up. I feel strongly kids meals should come with milk if drinks are included.

I'd eat elsewhere before coming here again."}
{"text":"We went here on Taco Tuesday ($2 tacos), mainly because the first restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed.  We were greeted by our server, who immediately tried to push alcoholic drinks on us.  We came here at lunch time on a weekday, so I wasn't really in the mood to get hammered, but we did order some aguas frescas instead (Horchata and jamaica, it was either 5 or 6 dollars).  They were a hefty price, but it was served in a very large glass.  My horchata was OK, it had decent flavor and was fairly refreshing.  The jamaica was very concentrated, so if you like a lot of tangy hibiscus flavor this is the drink for you.  

We ended up ordering a variety of tacos, but not before our server tried to push some guacamole (Around $6) on us.  We didn't really want any at first, but she insisted that it was some of the best guacamole ever and was one of the best appetizers in the house.  Soo.... we begrudgingly accepted, since we wanted to see what the hype was about.  When we got the appetizer, it was in a tiny little bowl, and covered with pomegranate seeds.  It tasted OK, and was made with fresh ingredients, but I can honestly make fresh guacamole like this at home with bigger portions for way cheaper.  

The tacos were small, like street taco size.  They came on a single small corn tortilla, and were piled high with filling.  I would have liked to see them use 2 tortillas on top of each other for stability, because I couldn't really hold the tacos in my hand to eat them.  Because they were so full, and the ingredients were a bit juicy, they would fall off while the tortilla fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Sadly, I had to actually eat most of the tacos with a fork and knife like a gringo.  I do appreciate the generous amount of filling that was in them though, but at taquerias I've been to they typically double the street taco tortillas for this very reason.  As for the ingredients themselves, they have some unusual ones here you won't find at other Mexican restaurants, which I appreciate, but on the whole I didn't find the tacos too great taste-wise.  I had some huitlacoche tacos, a first for me, but the whole kernels of fungus-infected corn popped in my mouth as I ate them with a gooey, mushy texture on the inside, with not much flavor.  It wasn't too pleasant of a experience taste and texture wise; I felt like I was eating a bunch of pus.  Perhaps if they were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels it would have tasted better, since a big kernel on a small taco can overwhelm the whole dish.

Additionally, our server was fairly attentive, as long as there was something for her to push on us.  But, when it came time to get the check, she was no where to be seen, and we had to wait a very long time before anyone came over to our table.  

So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on yelp prior to going, yet I could not get over the slow service and marginal food.  We had a party of 16 and it would appear that the staff was just out to lunch for the 3 hour dinner party.  It was Saturday night and it wasn't a full house so I was unsure what the staff was focused on.  I had a bunch of small tacos which were ok, the Salsa was good, just not chunky and hard to enjoy for all because we were not given spoons. The corona was served cold."}
{"text":"Barrio is a lot better than I expected. It was a bit pricey compared to most mexican restaurants, but the quality is very high so it is worth it. I just got a burrito and I was impressed and the quality of ingredients inside. I love the environment as well. The chips and salsa were also delicious. The portions are big. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"These were probably the worst street size tacos I've ever had and I can't believe I paid $10 for them.  I'm not sure what took them so long to bring them out. The shrimp taco was cold and I ate half of it before finding any shrimp. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice enough and took order but didn't seem very interested in our presence. 
The best thing about this place was their artwork and decor."}
{"text":"I was craving elote, but was busy around the house. So... Barrio Queen and DoorDash to the rescue! We got the Queen Enchilada & Chile Verde. The fresh made to order tortillas were delicious! My daughter wasn't a fan of the salsa because it was bland to her, but I loved the roasted veggies and garlic and thought it had great flavor! The elote, my reason for the order, was delicious and well worth the wait. I can't wait to make my way over to the restaurant and try some of their other specialties. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our experience today.  I had the California Enchiladas and they were nothing out of the ordinary. I felt that the cheese that was used was a piece of string cheese melted inside of the tortilla.  Our waiter never came back and asked me if we needed a refill on my drink.  Not sure if I would even call this authentic Mexican food.   The margaritas are very over priced as well."}
{"text":"Twice in a row best service ever in my life. My family of 6 went for my birthday and everything was perfect. Great happy hour prices. We had 16 oz Negro Modelos for $4! Awesome 3/$10 tacos, and yummy chips and salsa. Flan for my bday and french roast coffee to die for. Fun ambiance but the best takeaway of all, the service. Our waitress Sheree and her waitress in training Maria rocked! Sheree memorized all six of our names which was so endearing, above and beyond and impressive! New fave place!"}
{"text":"Meh, food was edible. Service was fine, but not great considering there seemed to be a ton of employees and we were there at 3 in the afternoon. I thought it was very overpriced. You have to buy everything individually. We got one fried fish taco (just tasted like greasy batter hardly any fish), one grilled fish (least favorite), two grilled shrimp, one of the \"house favorite\" pork, rice and beans. We both thought the grilled shrimp was best, but it was so tiny-- one medium sized shrimp per taco. The black bean side was $3 and a very small portion. The rice had a nice flavor but the texture of rice reminded me of the cheap rice you get at a hospital cafeteria :/ We had finished half our meal when they eventually brought the chips and salsa. The decor looked cool from the outside because the bar is cute but inside seemed dated already. And the music selection was obnoxious. I know there are lots of other things on the menu that are probably good but it will be hard to get me to come back because our first try was so lackluster and the prices are just too high for what we got. Too bad, I was excited for this."}
{"text":"Really good food, wonderful selections suggested by our server. Albondigas soup was delicious, nachos appetizer super yummy, cochinita pibil on spot delish, and Arizona burrito was to die for. Just needed refill reminders occasionally."}
{"text":"Food was good, not the best I ever had but definitely worth trying. The table side guacamole was outstanding. Services as super slow, took us awhile once seated to even get water. But outside seating was incredible and nice place to be."}
{"text":"Loved the food. We ordered off of the street taco menu. We had the pastor, conchinita pibil, chicken with pinon crema and pork Verde with cactus. Every taco was delicious. We  had a couple of skinny Margaritas, just tequilla, lime juice and agave . They were tasty. The food is upscale and so are the prices. Small two or three bite street tacos are $3 and up. Is it worth it? I would say yes. There are plenty of inexpensive taco shops if you want a huge $4 carne asada burrito and that has it's place. If you want an elevated Mexican food experience try this."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this new restaurant  but for awhile. Street tacos are amazing.  Fun atmosphere and decent happy hour.  There can be a long line on weekends."}
{"text":"About 75 of us went in all at once today for a toys for tots bike cruise. We only had the bloody Mary's, which by the way are now my favorite (and I'm picky on bloody Mary's) but the staff was awesome, fast, attentive, kind. We'll be back to try out your food :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two weeks and like it. First time I ordered the carne asada. It was different than what I'm used to but tasted okay. My husband ordered the Arizona Burrito and it was amazing. Their pork in Chile verde sauce is really good. Second time I went we started with a pulled pork appetizer that was really tasty and I had three tacos. The pork was delicious brisket was good and shrimp meh. This place is decent food, good drinks and a great vibe."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was amazing. Second visit was OK. Third visit a bust. 

Third visit a fight broke out between two tables...complete with profanity and yelling. Not that it was the restaurant's fault, but it was their attitude about it that floored me. 
We were asked to be moved because I had my young teenage son with us and our family from out of town. Their response? Hmph!!! and said we would need to be put back on the waiting list (even though there were empty tables). Really? Then they said there was really nothing they could do about it. 

Yes, they eventually moved us outside, which was great except they acted like we were a huge imposition to them. Now, if this was my restaurant and a patron was being unruly and yelling/swearing I would ask them to leave out of respect for everyone else who had to listen. Honestly, I was a little scared of the group next to us as they were really getting loud and yelling profanities at another table. The restaurant? Turned a blind eye. So odd.

Once we were moved they almost forgot about us. The service was slow. They gave our dessert to another table and didn't even apologize about it. It took almost 20 minutes to get it. 

So unfortunate because the food is pretty good. But the waitresses are a bit rude. Is that suppose to be part of their bold brand? I don't know but I am not impressed. If I go back, I will sit at the bar. The bartender was great and polite. But, I doubt I would go back now. Rude. Rude. Rude. Hard to forget that kind of experience, honestly."}
{"text":"Have been twice...Food is very good.  Taco Tuesday is great...Price for quacomole is ridiculous! 
My biggest gripe is that I called to see if they took reservations....NO.  Arrived and requested seating for 9.  I was told they were full and were waiting for a party of 12 to arrive...hmm I called to make a reservations and was told it is first come first serve......her reply was they stop by and put their name in!  Ummm that is called a RESERVATION.  Food is great Service is terrible all around!"}
{"text":"$15 for a brisket burrito (Doordash) that was 90% rice and tortilla with precious little brisket. Overpriced. Flavor rate 6 out of 10."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner here, the guacamole and street tacos were to DIE for!!! The environment was lovely as was our waitress Krys! Definitely will be coming back here! I wanna try everything on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Dakota made our night at the bar! Great margaritas and amazing service! Keep it up you guys are killing it!"}
{"text":"Fish Tacos were too small portion for the flour tortilla, annoyed i had to assemble myself when I'm on a date.  Shrimp ceviche was a very small dish and i expected a larger portion and I had do dig for the seafood, there was probably 4 chunks of seafood in the ceviche. Ordered a Chile Relleno vegetales and it was served luke warm because the cheese was almost solid."}
{"text":"I had a great service experience, but a lack luster food experience this evening. Showed up around 5:40pm for HH, which runs 2pm-6pm Mon- Fri. They offer complimentary chips and salsa- I recommend requesting the habanero salsa, which has a nice delayed kick vs their regular salsa, which is also pretty good. Chips seem to be homemade but nothing to write home about. I ordered the Pork Tinga Poblano Pepper $7 and Quesadilla Con Pollo $7 for dinner. Both options were just ok- I preferred the Quesadilla over the Pepper. My waitress recommended the roasted Elote (grilled corn), Puerco Verde Cup and mini tortas. Will be back to try other options. Tried their casa margarita $6 on HH- it was decent. They also offer red and white wine $5 glass and Mexican beer $4 for 16 oz beers or 1/2 odd select Tequilas"}
{"text":"Love their bartender! He knows us! Remembers a Makers and Diet and House Marg, he always says we don't need a menu (we always order the same thing) but I still ask for one to view, debate and settle on good ol faithful, THE BEST ...AL PASTOR. The drinks are good, the food is great and the chips and salsa seriously are a force to be reckoned with...bring it..anyone that dares that is. Last time I got the grilled shrimps taco also and it was so good. I think anything you order here is a great shot at a good meal, always made with quality ingredients, cooked with love and served with pride...job well done :)

This is my loves favorite place, I am growing to it dearly."}
{"text":"As with many places in Scottsdale, especially in old town Scottsdale, which is very much a \"survival of the fittest\" sort of place for restaurants, there was at least one prior culinary resident of the location in which you will now find this establishment. It was a restaurant with a focus on New Orleans style cuisine and more on the higher end of fine dining while Barrio Queen definitely, while still having that sort of old town Scottsdale polish from being in an area filled with high incomes, it also has a more casual New Mexico/Arizona sort of feel that I think is a distinct positive. It also has quite a bit of outside seating which unfortunately was filled up when I went by with friends around 3 pm, and so we ended up being seated inside which, at the same time, gave me a chance to watch the operational capabilities of the servers and waitstaff.

First of all, and this may have been due to some sort of festival going on in old town Scottsdale, but the workforce seemed stretched a bit thin relative to the amount of customers. My table ordered drinks and app and then the drinks were finished and...no waiter....I finally got up (and this is why the inside table was good) and just ordered from the bartender directly to get a fresh set of drinks. So, don't know if this was a one time thing or or a more common experience for diners but something the management of Barrio Queen needs to watch. I will note that the bus staff was quite helpful and nice to see how they worked to sort of fill the gap, keep the table clean of used glasses and dishes, offered to bring fresh silverware, etc.

First off, the drinks, the regular margarita is okay and $3 a glass during happy hour and you can get Sangria (red and white) by he pitcher for about $20 and same for the margaritas. I wasn't overly impressed with the sangria roja and my friend had the suave made with jalapeno infused tequila and fresh fruit juices, not my thing but an experience. Overall all cocktails were between $8 and $12 which is a fairly reasonable price for this area.

As for the food, for the appetizers we had the choriqueso, which is sort of a Mexican cheese fondue with crumbled mexican sausage. The chips are not corn chips but fresh fried quartered slides of tortilla that stand up well to the melted cheese dip. We also had the guacamole, which tends to be of a melange of guacamole and red onion and about $6. I would raise the price a bit and provide more guacamole and honestly, wasn't too jazzed on the guacamole recipe and think they might want to check out the guacamole at Mucho Gusto in Tempe as a comparison, which stands out, for me, as a significantly better mix and also, the chips at Mucho Gusto, for whatever reason,  a lot better.

We did have the family style entree which is for two or more and comes with unlimited supply of epazote black beans (quite good, big thumbs up), mexican cole slaw (seems like it had lettuce and tomatoes in it, more like a soggy salad, not really my favorite but good for you), and the these small, fresh made, street taco size corn tortillas and wow, those are amazing....they are fresh made and taste like it and to me, that is a real stand out that you don't see at other places. Canteen on Mill, which mades great street tacos, doesn't have one's like these and the fresh made corn tortillas are worth a visit, I give big kuddos to Barrio Queen for offering this sort of fresh authentic fair.

Finally, for the entrees, we had the mole, which is shredded chicken in a mole sauce. My friend who loves mole sauce said it was good but overly oily, whatever that means, but I thought it was doesn't though I'm not a big lover of mole. We also had the barrio pollo, which comes in a cream sauce with green peppers, I thought that was good, though the chicken was in strips, not shredded, which would have been better. Finally, we had the cochinita pibil which is slow roasted pork with pico de gallo and pickled onions and it was fairly good.

So, back to the review, 3 starts because well, at this experience, the wait service just wasn't all that great and it may be my only experience since a restaurant I do love, the herb box, is within walking distance but I think that over time as long as management is self-reflective, this place may continue to improve. I'm looking at Alex F's review from 02/23 and see he went when they were not busy and the service was still not great. Well, if they don't get the service situation down, especially in the highly competitive market in which this place is located, in a year or two we might all be reviewing whatever new eating establishment has taken the place of this one, such is the life of restaurants in old town Scottsdale, and boy will I miss those little fresh made corn tortillas."}
{"text":"On the plus side, the various fillings for tacos were great to choose from. Also, the guacamole appetizer was a good size. The standard salsa was also quite good. 

On the down side, the tacos themselves were way too small - the tortillas were maybe 4 inches and singles. A plate of 3 looked very sparse. The guacamole Appetizer needed work - as in the table-side prep, which our server just didn't seem to have the patience to complete. The chips were fresh and warm, but too greasy for my taste. 

Nice menu with lots of options, but overall it amounts the meh."}
{"text":"Cutest restaurant ever. Every detail is amazing. I really love this place. The dulce de leche creme brûlée is to die for !!!!!! I had the queen enchiladas which were very yummy as well!!"}
{"text":"Bland food...you shouldn't have to salt Mexican food (or any food) at a restaurant! Service was very slow. The crowd was dead (late Sunday) but music decent. Bill was $60 for 2 people and we ended up only eating a few bites."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having incredible Mexican food in Phoenix, and Barrio Queen definitely did not disappoint.  From the incredible breadth of taco options to the drink menu, this place has quality food and a great atmosphere. It's a tad expensive, but worth it. 

Our group started out with some table side guacamole as well as chips and queso. The guac is pretty unique-  it came with dried cranberries in it.  I definitely recommend it, but the portion is a little small for a large group, so maybe order 2! You won't regret it. The queso came with chorizo on top, and I am a vegetarian, but the other members of my party thoroughly enjoyed it! We ordered two pitchers of sangria- 1 red and 1 white.  Both options are phenomenal, and come in a glass with a sugar salt rim....such a delicious touch.  

We loved our server, she was kind and offered great advice on ordering! I highly recommend the restaurant; it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Okay, this was really bad!  The carnitas were dry and tasted old, like they'd been sitting in some warmer all day long...AWFUL...NEW FLASH--- Carnitas should be soft and moist! 

Even the drinks where not make right!  We didn't eat but half our dinner and we were very hungry!"}
{"text":"This is the second Barrio Queen I have been to in AZ. This one was just as good. The atmosphere in dowtown Gilbert is very nice. We were able to sit out on the patio and enjoy a nice AZ evening. The food came out very fast, was delicious and large portions! The staff was nice, friednly and helpful with menu questions. I reccomend any of their burritos! Excited to go back for taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"In the mood for Mexican and in old town shopping around, why not try Barrio Queen!? This place wasn't very busy on a Saturday early afternoon which was really nice! Its a cute little Mexican Food place, gives off the normal ambiance, but what makes it a little cooler and catches your eye when your walking by, is their large patio area. They have a few outside tables along the side of their building and a larger covered area out back. Set up perfect for the weather we have been having lately. As soon as we stepped inside, everyone was very kind and helpful, this was our first visit, so they told us a little about the restaurant, the menu and their drinks.

We stopped by for just a small quick bite, so we order 3 small tacos, the carnitas, Al Pastor and the Carne Asada and oddly some mimosa's to go with them! Who said you can't have tacos and mimosas for brunch!?? LOL! Our waiter was very nice, informative, and attentive and actually made our morning better with how friendly and smiley he was. They always say if you smile at someone, it rubs off! It definitely did and he really helped make our morning! I feel awful for not remembering his name  The tacos were small which we knew going in, so if you are hungry I would order a few, but they were definitely delicious! The meat all tasted good, the onion and cilantro was all fresh, tortillas were fresh and warm! Great tacos!

Wonderful food, wonderful staff, cool place, had a great time!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe, great outdoor seating but the good ended there. The drinks were pretty unremarkable and the food was a major disappointment. No one in our group of four particularly enjoyed their meal. It was either super salty or way to spicy even for our group who enjoy spicy food. 

The table side Guac (cart) was equally unremarkable and the server prepping it seemed to want to be anywhere else at the time 

The service was ok but menu wise Barrio really needs to up their game. Can't recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic! The staff was very accommodating, the food was delicious and the server Ron made the entire experience a real pleasure!!!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place more stars if I could, we had a mishap with a local business that fired their chef at Casablanca Lounge and our reservation fell through as well as reservation changed too many times.

We came here and made a reservation with a 35 minute wait for a party of 7 people. We were taken to a table within 10 minutes, our server was Kerby and he was phenomenal! 

We were well taken care of with food orders and drinks never empty. I had made cupcakes as we were celebrating 2 birthdays that evening and they gladly stored them in the back refrigerator for us. Such a great experience for what we had been through. I highly recommend this place.

They have great chips and salsa, highly recommend the green chile enchiladas and their house margaritas are really good as well. Thank you again and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place, so glad they opened a location on this side of town. This was my second time. The first was good but they were obviously working out some start up kinks. So I wanted to post after my second visit. Most new restaurants have a few hiccups in the beginning. The tacos are great, atmosphere is fun and the staff is wonderful! Don't be discourage by the other negative reviews most of them sound like it was due to being a new business and they judged too soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Barrio on a Saturday night based on our hotel recommendations. We arrived and was told the wait was an hour. No problem at all. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes which was great. 

We were escorted to our seat and our waiter arrived. It started to go downhill from there. Our waiter was extremely dry and I take it he must have been overwhelmed. 

We started with the table side guacamole at $14. At first I was like nope to $14 guacamole but then I saw the portions and we went with it. The guacamole was really good and it was topped with pomegranate. I thought it wasn't going to be good but I was pleasantly surprised. That's what earned them 2 stars. 

We also ordered 2 house margaritas at $8 each. Once it arrived I took about 3 sips and it was gone. Definitely overpriced for the oz received. 

By now our waiter hasn't come back and I have to flag him down for napkins and to let him know we are ready to order. I ordered the Queen Enchilada add shrimp and my husband had the Carne Asada Burrito. We also had the corn as well. 

Before our meals arrived my husband ordered a sangria and more chips to finish the guacamole. Our meals arrived and my food was cold. Not luke-warm but cold. The cheese had settled and it just wasn't good. Not to mention the shrimp was put on top of the enchilada, the 5 shrimp I must say. Now my husbands meal was hot and very good. The waiter came back and I explained what happened. The manager came over and offered to remake my meal and put the shrimp inside. By now it's late and after eating off my husband's meal
I'm not hungry. Plus my husband never received his sangria or our chips. My order came out and I took a couple of bites and was done. 

I had high expectations for this place after reading the reviews and the recommendations but was disappointed during our stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have now tried a few Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale and until now, I was less than impressed. In my opinion, if I'm spending $15+ an entree at a sit down Mexican restaurant, I want FREE chips and salsa. This place brings it. Not only are they free, but the chips and salsa are homemade. The salsa is the kind I like to just eat with a spoon, it's so good. It's roasted and not too spicy but super full of flavor. It's the best.

We ordered tableside guacamole and loved the quantity (totally share size for at least 4) and the addition of pomegranate seeds on top, but I was hoping for a little more flavor. It was mostly just chunky avocado and some additions. I also like to be asked if I like it spicy (I do) and this guy seemed either busy or disinterested. 

I ordered some enchiladas and you could totally tell the red chile sauce was made in-house. I've made my own at home and it tasted just like it. They use dried red chiles and sometimes they can't get it perfectly pureed and there are a few flakes of rough skin-- that's how you know it's fresh. It was MY FAVORITE.

My husband went with a burrito and also loved it.

My only regret was not getting there a bit sooner for a Happy Hour margarita, but otherwise this place was flawless. It also helped that we were seated outdoors on the most perfect summer evening that wasn't too hot. I'll rectify the situation soon, don't worry!"}
{"text":"Went here a little after they opened yesterday with the hubby. Was a little nervous with all the less-than-great reviews about service, but our service was great. The menu says they have Diet Dr. Pepper, but they didn't when I asked (not a major deal breaker for me, regular DP is fine) and I'd definitely avoid the Chipotle Mashed Potatoes next time (they were oddly bland?). But the Arizona burrito I had was super delicious and hubby seemed to enjoy all his tacos. So thumbs up. Would come back."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed.  I picked up 2 dozen frozen tamales for Christmas; a dozen beef and a dozen pork.  Our plan changed so I decided to heat some up. I started with the red beef. The masa was uncooked. it was the consistency of baby food. I was thinking bad batch and tossed them. I heated up the green pork, same results, partially cooked the rest looked incredibly under cooked. See the attached picture.  Quality control needs to improve dramatically.  1 star because that is the minimum."}
{"text":"This is maybe my third or fourth visit. Food is so fresh and amazing. Service is very good. We love the street tacos at 3 for $10. Happy hour margarita was surprisingly delicious. We love the ambiance of the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome chips, asked for spicier salsa with habaneros, delish!  Hubby had Arizona Burrito, best he's ever had!  My grilled fish tacos were Just great, 3 was perfect amount as suggested by server.  perfect skinny marg!  Great service!  Our new go to place!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, drinks & food were pretty good, BUT I was pretty uncomfortable the entire time because it was 9pm (gorgeous weather), and the misters were out of control. I asked if they could be turned down or off (around 9:30pm) but I was denied. I guarantee no other customers would have minded (they were off on the bar side and it wasn't hot out), but they didn't really care. We would have stayed longer for drinks but oh well! Maybe we'll go back when it's 120 degrees."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Went there last night and the hostess act like snarky mean girls.... We waited for.an hour and 10 minutes or so and the system for checking your place  in line was not working... we.finally get seated and our waitress was this girl.withh glasses who acted very inconvenienced and also made.the most horrible and overpriced guacamole on the planet !!!!! She seemed disengaged and was.not.nice at all. The barrio queen in Scottsdale has the nicest wait staff this location on the othher hand could care less about customer service...."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate Fathers Day with 2 little toddlers and they were so nice and welcoming  . Food was delicious and our waiter Marcelo was so nice!! The queso and the guacamole are to die for , the enchiladas and chilaquoles were wonderful. Save room for dessert it was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Upon a recommendation from our concierge, we went here for lunch on Cinco de Mayo.  They don't take reservations but we were able to get a table outside without waiting.  It was a hot day but there were misters helped a little. My dining companion and I shared an order of 3 enchiladas suizas, beans and rice.  The food was excellent. It's very different from your typical Mexican food but in a good way.  It was delicious.  The service, however, leaves A LOT to be desired. It was inexcusable.  Our server was too busy doing other things (non-server related) and totally ignored us.  We finally had to flag him down.  He never bothered to ask us what we wanted to drink, or bring us chips and salsa until we asked.  He didn't offer to refill our drinks, never checked to see if we enjoyed the food or wanted anything else.  To top it off he didn't return the credit card after we paid the bill.  I can admit that it could have been the cashier's fault but still he should have looked to see if he needed to return a credit card with the receipt.  Finally, on our way out we walked right past the server.  We said goodbye to him and he turned away from us and didn't say anything.  If you expect people to come back to your restaurant you should hire staff who will help ensure that happens.  A bad server ruins a great meal - and your reputation."}
{"text":"So disappointed!!!!!! I have been wanting to come here since they opened. Upon our first attempt to eat here, was on a Sunday night. The wait time was over an hour. We decided to pass and come some other time. 

We came on 12/28 around 5:45 pm. Were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. We ordered 2 appetizers. The meat topped French fries and the pollo quesadilla's. Both came out at best Luke warm.  The flavor of everything was great from what I could tell and we were pretty hungry so we ate a few, but then pushed aside.  Our meal came out shortly after. 

I ordered 3 mixed tacos, beer battered fish tacos, the grilled fish tacos with shrimp and the beef brisket tacos with a side of refried black beans. 
My husband ordered the carne asada burrito. 

When they came out, I immediately stuck my finger in the beans, only because of the way the appetizers came out.... Luke warm at best, then felt temp of all the meat on the tacos...cold!!!!!
My husbands burrito was the same. At that point we looked for our server and motioned for her to come over. I asked her to feel our food and as she did she said it wasn't hot and we said exactly. She said she would send the manager over. He came over and I had him go thru the same thing and he agreed that it wasn't up to par with their quality. Apologized profusely, was very, very nice about it. Said he was going to talk to the kitchen staff and check quality on everything else.  When he returned, again apologizing, he said he would take everything off the bill and would have everything made fresh within 5 minutes. While he offer was decent enough, we opted to just leave and perhaps come back for another try some other time. 

My concern was that especially with fish and shrimp it has to maintain a certain temp as to not make people sick. And...how could a beer battered fish taco possibly have come out cold if it was made fresh?! So, that means that it truly wasn't made fresh, which begs the question, how long was it sitting out for before they decided to serve it to me?! .........not good at all. 

I give the server a positive review, as I feel she did a good job all the way around and the manager a good review as he did try to accommodate us and make the bad situation right. However, the cooks need to be fired in my opinion. Horrible."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and was craving Mexican. My dining partner and I went late (8 p.m.), for Gilbert Arizona Restaurant on a Sunday. Note they do not take reservations and in the past there has always been long waits. When we arrived, no wait, in fact the restaurant was hardly inhabited. We were seated at a big table for 2, it happened to be AZ Restaurant week that week, but we opted not to take part. Our server Andy N introduced himself and was very good.

We ordered the Casa Margarita, the Burrito Arizona, Shrimp Ceviche and my favorite, a Bowl of Menudo.

I thought I liked Barro Queen much better in the past visits. The drink and food presentation was very nice. The Margarita was too sweet, hardly any Tequila and the food tasted very BLAH. Can't put my finger on it but just BLAH (no spice, no kick, just there) Sorry, with so many other Mexican places to dine at, I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.

Atmosphere: fun, Service: very good, Food: very very OK BLAH"}
{"text":"2nd time to Barrio Queen, 1st time at the Gilbert location, 1st. time here at the Scottsdale location. We came here for Restaurant Week to take advantage of the Sweet $33 offering. We  arrived on a Saturday at 5:30 since they do not take reservations. We were greeted and seated right away. There is a different feel between locations, Scottsdale more intimate and homey feel, Gilbert big and more commercial feeling.

At first, I thought service was going to be a disaster as we sat at the table for about 15 minutes with whom I thought would of been our waiter snubbing us, until we got the Host, who then took out drink and dinner order. Then out of the blue Adrian our server made our table side Guacamole and it was smooth sailing there after... thank you Adrian

We ordered off the Restaurant Week $33 Menu, Drink: Casa Margarita, 1st. course: Barrio Guacamole, 2nd course: Cochinita Pibil, 3rd. course: Churro. All the food was served in a timely fashion was delicious and our waiter, very attentive. On the side we also wanted to try the MX Chicken Soup which was also very good.

Scottsdale location atmosphere we loved, food excellent, service very good once our waiter for our table was established."}
{"text":"The food is great!  I love the Chili Verde Tacos. Me and my husband love stopping in for a drink and good food.  We really appreciate Kara the bartender. She is so upbeat and attentive.  She takes god care of us every time we are there. We appreciate how hard she works!"}
{"text":"First time we went my husband and I almost walked out. It took 20 min to get chips and salsa and waters while a million people walked by and ignored us. The food was good. The second time when I went with friends we got amazing service but the food was not good and our orders were all wrong."}
{"text":"The guacamole is awesome! It's handmade in front of you. I enjoy the cranberries they throw into it. I've been here twice. The second time with a group of friends from out of town. The location is great but otherwise we were not impressed with the food or service. The dishes were lacking flavor and there was nothing exciting. If you'd like to still try them out I'd check them out during their happy hour for Happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"I had the El Lote & Carne Asada tacos. The meal was subpar. The Atmosphere is nice though. If you want to sit somewhere nice and eat overpriced mediocre food this place is for you."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been going to barrio queen in old town Scottsdale for awhile and love the music there, but this location doesn't play the Mexican music that they play at the old town location, which they should cause it feels more authentic and fun. But besides the music the food is amazing and the drinks are great! Gets busy here which isn't that bad of a thing."}
{"text":"How fun - loved it! The tableside gucolomoe just could not get any fresher and is most unique with dried fruit and pomegrante seeds. A must try with friends. We didn't sit outside due to the frigid weather but you can enjoy a plethora of outdoor seating. You can pick and choose which tacos you want and how many since they are kind of a la carte. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Like any good Mexican restaurant, I left here filled to the brim. My friend and I waited 45 mins for a table, which was way too long. Maybe because its still kind of new? Anyway, we ended up sitting outside and ordered the tableside guacamole. We legit ate the whole thing and all the chips. The chips were so thick and some of the best I've ever had. Normally I can control myself, but not with these babies. We were so full after the guac that we each only ordered 2 street taco. I had the carnitas and brisket. I think I literally said, \"oh my God\" as I took the first bite of the pork. It was delicious. However, like others have said, the service could use some improvement and I also questioned the freshness of the wine. But I definitely will be for more tacos!"}
{"text":"Disappointed as we received good recommendations, the service was fast and friendly however the amount and quality of food received for the price was disappointing. Ordered table side guacamole $10.00 not with it! My wife and I both ordered 3 tacos for $10.00 each carne Asada tacos were bland tuff zero taste, shrimp taco and Chorizo tacos were good but 3 bites and they were gone. So $45.00 after tip I left still hungry and disappointed, my recommendation would be go to lo lo's chicken and waffles next door!"}
{"text":"Why I tried this place a 3rd time idk... Maybe because I like their table top guacamole but not this time the girl making it didn't know how to even pit the avacodo way to much lime juice and salt. But that's not the main compliant my friend ordered the soup with pork in it. She barely could eat it. The pork tasted like it was old and over cooked.  This was her first time here I really hoped to wow her with the guacamole but no and very disappointed with the food again. Waitress acted as if she didn't care of we were not satisfied she was more into the bigger table she was serving.  Last time ever for me. Had to give 1 star doesn't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Best thing here is the Queens Cooler drink and the house guacamole! Both are amazing. The drink is like a coconut margarita. The chips are fried to awesomeness. I recommend if you are visiting you stop here."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and the sangria was pretty good. Our food took over an hour to get to the table after we ordered. Hopefully this is just a kink they need to work out since they just opened. But it wouldn't have been as bad waiting that long if our server had acknowledged the long wait or apologized in some way, which she did not.  I had the tacos which were very good (chicken one was really good, the veggie one wasn't that great though). Will wait a while for them to get the hang of things before I go back."}
{"text":"Grab a seat outside. Great street tacos, very authentic-great friendly service-thx Senor Pablo."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go with friends. The tacos are delicious as well as the table side guac. The corn and black beans are unbelievable. Juan has been my server every time I come to Barrio and he is the absolute best. Request him if you can. He makes the experience fun and relaxed whether it's a quick lunch with one margarita or a Friday night filled with many drinks.  Best server at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I made the mistake of coming on a Friday night,and if you don't plan to drinking then this place sucks.  Spent over 2 hours here between the wait and food. Service was terrible food was deceiving. Not happy at all wouldn't recommend this place. High expectations and poor performance"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and have enjoyed it in the past. This last Saturday night we took out a town company. I was never more embarrassed. The food and service were absolutely disgusting. While the waiter was friendly and pleasant he did not know how to clear one dish and we had to ask him at least three different times to remove the dishes. It took 35 minutes to get our meal and the food was barely lukewarm when we got it. My husband's carne asada  was horrific and he barely ate 2 bites and we decided to throw the leftovers away. Bottom line, I got sicker than a dog. I wasn't sure what caused it since I ordered the guacamole, conchinita pabil, and flan for dessert. After suffering almost 24 hours, we actually took some of those leftovers home. The only thing I had left was the pork. So I decided to try that again and hope that I got sick on something else. Wrong! The entire night was spent in the bathroom and I didn't sleep for more than 10 minutes. I have lost yet another entire day due to this restaurant and their food. I think the Gilbert health department needs to be notified and I will give them a call this morning. I will never set foot in this restaurant again and will notify my friends that go there of what happened. I may even post on Facebook.
DO NOT EAT HERE unless you have a very strong stomach and lots of medication."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool, but the chips were really kinda thick and greasy. Had to ask the staff for salt apparently they were instructed to no longer put it out on the tables for the guests unless they requested it.  I had the Mexican Mojito \"Roger Clines\" drink, it was good but a bit pricey.  Not quite as good as I wanted it to be. They did make the guac fresh at your table which was definitely the best part."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful inside, very interesting decor and nice photos and neat inside bar too. My friends and I had the Happy Hour prices on tacos and on beer but were so sad when it ended at 6 since we had to rush from work. Manager--please extend your great happy hour til 630 or 7pm. We want to come back and enjoy those delicous beers and delicious tacos a bit longer!!! Our waitress Megan was GREAT."}
{"text":"Food sucked. All our food came out cold then we sent it back and it came out cold again. They probably didn't even touch it. Just kept it back there for a couple minutes to act like they were warming it up. Manager didn't even come by or nothing. Won't be back. Shitty management"}
{"text":"Great food, service and location! Perfect place for a birthday celebration! They also had musicians playing latin jazz ;-)"}
{"text":"We have been waiting about a month to try this place because every time we are starving and ready to eat, the wait has been over an hour. Tonight we prepared for the evening knowing it was going to be a long wait, put our names in, went to target for some last minute things for the house and was back in time for the text that our table was ready. We were sat on the patio which was beautiful, waitress was nice. Ordered drinks and appetizers. When the appetizer arrived i asked the buzzer for silverware, he said ok and left. Never did it come. We ate the appetizer with chips. The waitress then came to take our order, asked her for silverware before she left. Never did it come. The same busser delivered our dinner. 4 of us. One meal didn't show up, and one meal was incorrect, the response from the buzzer to the wrong meal was \"well, do you want it?\" Asked that same busser from before if we could have some silverware. Saw him come back and clear a table (no silverware). A nice blonde was helping our server maya and she cleared the stack of appetizer plates that were sitting in front of me which was considerate, asked her for silverware. Didn't come. About 5-10 minutes later our waitress came out and apologized for the wrong order, i simply asked for silverware just to eat what we had in front of us. After convincing my husband not to get up and leave, we waited patiently for her to not come back, but send another busser with 4 roll-ups that we're delivered to the table behind us. They kindly gave us the silverware, so we could eat our cold dinner. When our waitress returned to ask if we needed anything, i asked for my meal that never came out to be put in a box and that we were all set. The meal then came out on a plate about 5 minutes later, i asked the person who delivered it to give me a box and he quickly returned with one. I was amazed. We then waited 15 minutes for our check that never came. I went to find a manager just to pay the bill because my conscious would eat me if i just walked out. I'm extremely disappointed at the incompetence of simple service. I've been a waitress for over 10 years and grown up in the restaurant business so i know understand that things can go wrong sometimes. But one thing after another, and 20$ taken off a bill for a meal that was put in a box and a smile was not enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"What a great dinner time at Barrio's Queen. Great selection on the menu, and all four meals we had were delicious. We enjoyed that great food, wonderful margaritas and great time catching up with friends. Definitely will be back to try other meals. And oh those chipotle mesh potatoes YUMM YUMM ."}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here by Dre at Montelucia resort and am I happy I did.

The guac with cranberries was weird at first, then delicious! I really enjoyed the barrio pollo and pescado tacos; best chicken taco ever hands down.

The service was hands down the best- props to Nomas and Ivette!!"}
{"text":"Best guac I've EVER HAD.  Rest of the meal was amazing too, and the wait staff and overall experience was terrific.  Highly recommended.  And did I mention that the guac is the best I've EVER HAD!! :)"}
{"text":"We always go to the Gilbert location, first time here in the PHX location and just as great. Ask for Carlos as your server, one of the best ever."}
{"text":"The food is just okay but definitely not worth the price or the very slowwww service.  The wait staff appeared to be disorganized and not prepared for a busy Saturday night.   We waited 50 min for a table and another 25 min to place our order, then another 30 min for our food.   Don't visit this place unless you have plenty of time."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the outdoor seating. We had beef burrito and beef enchilada they where pretty good, I would go back. However having a margarita in a Real Margarita glass would have been better. The server was less than attentive, she obviously wanted to be someplace else. To bad."}
{"text":"This is hard for me to write. We loved this place. Went there a few times a month and always had a great time. There were occasional hiccups, but there is everywhere. However, this last time we went, about a month ago, left me so upset and annoyed. We went for happy hour, had a great time, really liked our server and everything. He let us know that his shift was finishing up and we settled up with him because we were done ordering and just finishing up. Our bill was $73 and change. We wrote in a $20 tip on the line and my boyfriend wrote the total as $103 and change. Our server came by and grabbed the check after we had signed it. After he took it I realized that we did the math incorrectly and it should have been $93. I gave him the benefit of a doubt and didn't track him down thinking that he would do the right thing and close it out with a $20 tip. However, when it posted to my bank account it drew for the $103. I was rather insulted because $20 on $73 is a fantastic tip and we were still sitting there when he closed it out. He could have come back and asked us what we meant. I called the manager a couple nights later when it had posted on my bank account and explained what happened. She was very responsive and said that the GM would call me the following day. She took my side saying that he should have closed it out with a $20 tip. Needless to say, no one ever followed up with me. All I wanted was my $10 back. We've spent hundreds of dollars at barrio queen, always taking VERY good care of our servers, but we can't say we will go back. What a shady thing for a person to do, scam an extra $10 out of me. This entire thing has just left me shaking my head."}
{"text":"We went for lunch with a group of friends, and the service and wait weren't bad at all - maybe because it was 7/3 and many people were off for the holiday. We were seated immediately, and the service was attentive and friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious. We couldn't eat enough of them! Everyone's food was quite tasty, although the taco sizes were disappointing. 3 tacos for $10 isn't outrageous, but we were expecting them to be slightly bigger. That said, the food was seasoned well. Definitely try the brisket or fish tacos - delish! Are there better Mexican options around this area? Probably. I don't think this will be a frequent go-to for us, but we wouldn't oppose to coming back now and then."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I've got to be honest, my experience here was not good.  The service was bad, as I continually had to ask our waitress for refills on our drinks, the food took forever to come out and when it did finally come out, it was cold.  I've been to the location in the airport many times and have always been happy with that location and the service there.  Unfortunately, the Gilbert location falls short."}
{"text":"This place is a nice location in downtown Scottsdale with lots of outside seating and 2 bar areas to keep the drinks coming. Service is good not great. I would recommend the guacamole instead of the queso if you want an appetizer to share. The queso is a preview of all of the pork and Chorizo tacos that they drain zero of the grease out of before serving. The 3 taco meal is a great option to try a little bit of everything, but be forewarned the grease in the beef a pork meals turn off the otherwise good flavor."}
{"text":"The Mole Enchiladas are amazing!!!!!  Mole sauce is chocolate based and super perfect here!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars but unable to.. It was my first time going there and my last. I literally felt like they robbed my money. The waitress didn't even ask if we enjoyed the food when she picked the tab - our plates were still full hardly touched. This place is HORRIBLE!! I'm from Guadalajara, Jalisco and the food at Barrio Queen is a joke!! The steak tacos were rubbery, my 8 yr old was chewing on it for over 10 min, unable to swallow it. It's over priced do not eat there. The service was bad and food was over priced for sure!! Save your money and the trip. Go to Whiskey Row instead or Even Stevens. FOR REAL."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio for lunch on a Saturday after a failed attempt on a Friday night ( the wait was over an hour).

Nice kids menu and the wait wasn't terrible mid afternoon.

Service was slow- but it's a fairly new location.

Food was good but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Anthony rocks best bartender in town, great food great conversation great place to relax after work.... will be back thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice, and I like the food. But yesterday (12/11/17), I sat at the bar outside to eat.  The service I received from the bartenders was pretty poor.  Two of them would walked by over & over again without checking if I needed a fill up on my drink, or the check.  Both were very busy talking to each other OR with the cute waitresses.  Once I was done eating, even flagging them down was hard.  I probably waited 10 minutes just to to get my check.

I will return......but likely not sit at the bar again!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I've heard great feedback about the Phoenix location, but this location wasn't great... The service is horrible and the food is so-so. I was expecting better quality and flavor for the price and reputation."}
{"text":"Good food and big servings too. Can be a bit pricy for some of the dishes. Not the typical refried beans and tacos. Service was a little slow. The leaves from the tree outside kept falling into our food so watch out if you decide to sit outside. I'd go again and try something new. (Without my unadventurous kids)"}
{"text":"Really over price and bland. 
My family ate here for lunch and was really disappointed. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The decor, the atmosphere, and even the bathrooms are cool. That's pretty much where the good parts end. 

The menu is confusing, and while the waitress was nice, there was an attitude of annoyance while she explained the menu. The service was a bit slow, and the $10 chips and guacamole (salsa comes in two very tiny little portions on the side) lasted about 3 minutes. The tacos were billed as street style. My dad and I each ordered three. They were customizable, but very basic and bland. It's literally a raw tortilla and some kinda warm meat. We left feeling hungry :(

On a side note- if you are bringing children- I hope they aren't picky eaters. I think they had three items for kids, and no beans. My daughter barely ate her quesadilla, and mostly ate chips. 

Over all it was kind of a bummer. It's not awful, just not good. It's also pricey. $120 for four adults who left hungry."}
{"text":"Strange layout that makes you think you got the worst table in the house no matter what table you're at.  Wait staff and the General Manager (WTF?) standing around doing nothing in a mostly empty restaurant while customers wait and wait.  It all comes off as the biggest tourist trap on Stetson Ave, even though the original Barrio Cafe is a local institution, and the prices are actually very reasonable.  Food and margaritas were all amazing, but  when the front of the house doesn't seem to care if I'm there I won't be back."}
{"text":"OK... Barrio queen is either a five-star restaurant or three-star restaurant... Purely dependent on what you order. If you order the tableside guacamole, the Mexican french fries, the street tacos, or the all-time favorite Arizona burrito, it is a five-star restaurant. They have the best Carne Asada tacos in Phoenix. If you order anything else, expected to be three stars. The service can be somewhat sluggish but considering I know what to order, the food makes up for it all day long!"}
{"text":"Bre was awesome!! Her guac was amazing and we will definitely be back for her service! She loves doing the chicken dance and the Macarena! Just ask her to do it while making the guac, just ask for the Guacarena special! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was delicious. Overall experience was great. Look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is in Old Town Scottsdale near the \"waterfront.\"  The restaurant occupies a relatively small space compared to its neighbors and is connected to Silvana Bistro.  We sat at the table facing the entrance with the Jose Cuervo mirrored sign, stylized hood cover from a car, and three tequila certificates.  The Don Julio print on the paper place maps seemed to indicate that there was some descent tequila served at Barrio Queen.  We enjoyed the simple three margarita with the Don that arrived in a plastic Pacifico pitcher.  My daughter had a cheese and mushroom quesadilla. Thick with cheese, mushrooms, and onions she got past the blueness of the blue corn tortilla and the onions, and consumed all of it.  The guacamole came chunky, spicy, and highly recommended by our waiter.  We polished it off quickly, still hungry.

Near our seats were black and white Barrio Queen shirts and food stuffs in cages.  The draft from the door was cold and unrelenting as patrons entered and exited.  Within site of our table was a Frida Khaloesque painting that had been Barrio Queened, a monitor with a slide show of employees, ingredients, and food, and a bar with pastries, caged liquor, and beers on tap and in a refrigerator.

The primary item, fifty of them, are fancy street tacos.  Each is a single, but everyone's order comes on their own plates.  I highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo.  The chorizo was really good.  The chorizo y al pastor was good and the cameron con coco was okay.  Four tacos and some of an appetizer seemed to be enough for a meal.  Adding some dessert was too much.  The churro was something to behold as it was topped with caramel and ice cream."}
{"text":"Our go to Mexican spot here in the valley- taco Tuesday is the best. Their street tacos may be 3 for $10 but they have a huge selection for tacos and they're always amazing. Very authentic. 

Carne asada chile renello is my FAVORITE. Gots some kick so watch out. 

Never had a bad experience here and the service is better and better each time. Always take visitors here and always recommend to my customers visiting as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the thicker style tortilla chips and the salsa was really yummy.

I had the Barrio Pollo taco and Carne Asada y Chile Relleno taco.  Both super tasty- the carne asada was my favorite.  The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly.

I had the churros for dessert- what I did not care for was the filling inside of the churros.  It was a sweet caramel-like filling.  Just personal preference.

Definitely want to go back and try more of their food!  It's nice to have a fresh Mexican food option at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest... overpriced, underwhelming taste and poor service. Not much else to say about our experience other than that... overpriced, bland and slow service. The search for my go-to Mexican restaurant continues. Open for suggestions, so hit me up. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What a major disappointment. This used to be a favorite but since an ownership change, it has gone waaaaaaay down - to the point that I just walked out because we could get no service. It was not bad service - literally zero service. After waiting in line for the hostess, even though there were empty tables, we were finally seated and then never acknowledged. No water. Nothing. No one cared even though many workers passed right by us. 

In my opinion, way past time for a management change. 

Maybe they can exist on the tourist traffic alone, but this is one local that will not accept this type of service - or rather lack of service."}
{"text":"An interesting modern twist on Mexican food. Interesting flavor combinations, tons of options, and of course table side Guac complete with craisins, yes craisins! It sounds weird because it is but strangely wonderful. You can't go wrong with the trio of tacos, I've tried 6 different flavor each as delicious as the next, btw chorizo and chicken is a golden combination. Fresh made chips are a little to thick and it's a little pricy, but delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food my wife and I have had. Service was great, food was even better. I got one of the Tortas - the meat was well done, the cheese was good and the avocado was a good touch. My wife got a Arizona burrito. I was able to steal a few bites, and it was awesome. The free chips and salsa were great too. Plus, we went on a Friday night and only had to wait 20 minutes for a table. 

For authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. A really fun atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I can't eat dairy, do Mexican food is often challenging. The tacos here are on par with any I've had in the whole country. Go on taco Tuesday. Best lunch deal in town. Plus the service is amazing at every location. 

And the decor is to die for. The bar and it's selection of tequila is stunning. I want to buy everything in their shop. If you like sugar skulls, caleveras, or day if the dead it's worth a stop just for that. (And I'm a designer and art history aficionado who's studied this stuff extensively). Well done guys."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Barrio Queen. There is no short supply of Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale but this one felt special. You will love the decor and the overall theme. The menu was a la carte which was a surprise. I highly recommended you get the guacamole as it will be made at your table side. BTW say YES to the pomegranate in the guacamole. Not only is it a traditional ingredient, it is excellent."}
{"text":"This has definitely been one of my favorites in Scottsdale but I absolutely love the atmosphere in Gilbert. It's got an amazing bar scene... the service is fabulous as always the food is just blow your mind delicious. Love the choice of tequila, there something for everybody and I'm so excited to have it and Gilbert go there now!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful lunch here.  We each ordered a plate of 3 tacos and it was fun picking from all the options on the menu.  Each one was unique and enjoyable.  Our server was very nice and helpful with our questions.  We were impressed with their ingredients for the tortilla chips and taco shells (no soy).  We also tried a frozen chocolate ice-cream-like desert that was really good."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to grab some tacos and watch a game. The staff at the bar is really friendly and best of all some of the staff are Raider fans."}
{"text":"After looking at the menu, I didn't think I was going to like the food as it's not the Mexican food I'm used to. We ordered the queso fundido even though it said it had mushrooms and peppers in it? I ordered the Azteca Enchilada and the hubs ordered the  Barrio Pollo burrito. Presentation was good and all of the food was AMAZING. The flavors were incredible without being overwhelming. Great server, chill environment. Definitely impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Went there this Memorial Day (my bday) I love the atmosphere and the music. Food was good not great but good had the tacos wasn't to pleased with the Al pastor but everything else was good. Staff was nice. Chips and Salsa where very good. I will give it a other try soon. (not to big fan of black beans should have pinto,refried also just saying)"}
{"text":"Decided to finally try out the food here after hearing others mention it. We went early afternoon so we didn't have to wait long for a booth. I decided to try one of their margaritas. La reyna poloma margarita is tastey and I was happy with my choice. Strong and delicious. The chips were ok. Some were a little chewy and a huge chunk was stuck together but that's ok. For my meal I decided on the Barrio pollo burrito and our waiter suggested trying the chorizo added into it. I'm glad I got the chorizo because it made the burrito super yummy. My fiancé got the Arizona burrito and he enjoyed his. The waiters here are friendly and attentive and answer any questions about the food on the menu. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So normally I have been underwhelmed by my experiences at the restaurants in downtown Gilbert. I saw photos of the food at Barrio Queen and felt optimistic though. 

Let me tell you,this place is LEGIT. They have a crazy happy hour for one 2-6???!! And the small plates on the menu are seriously amazing. 

When you go, ask to sit in Joy's section. She made so many good suggestions and was super friendly and awesome. 

Now we came at 2 on a Monday so I don't know how busy they get, but this place would definitely be worth the wait. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had been excited to try this new restaurant and had read good reviews of the Scottsdale location.  It's a cute room and because my companion and I went for lunch mid-week, we only waited about 10 minutes.  While I saw numerous staff around, our poor waitress was clearly spread too thin and was scrambling to get to each of her tables.  Having the waitress prepare the table-side guacamole at three tables during the time were were there didn't help the situation and further slowed down service.  We waited about 15 minutes before our waitress took a drink order.  We had to ask twice for chips and salsa, not to mention water.  The chips were stale, thick and cold (I prefer thin, fresh,warm and crispy).   The salsa had absolutely no flavor or heat.  It couldn't have been more bland.  My companion ordered three tacos.  They were the small street taco size and he said they were good.  I had the Queen enchiladas with shrimp and, although the shrimp were smaller than the waitress described, the dish was delicious.  I also ordered a pineapple agua fresca which was tasty.  My companion found the beer selection to be limited to only relatively cheap Mexican beers.  I will return to give Barrio Queen another chance but I have a feeling this may not be my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't believe how good the tacos are here.  We stopped by on \"Taco Tuesday\" and got all the tacos we wanted for $2.50 each!!  They have a huge variety of tacos to choose from and they're not your typical ones (better).  Patio seating on a warm spring afternoon was perfect and I've heard from friends that the guacamole the make at your table is amazing.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I were more than enthusiastic upon reading the menu.  The waitress was upbeat and helpful 
From there it went downhill !  
I ordered three tacos for $11 and received three soft shell  tortilla with a total of three shrimp , one for each 4 in  tortilla the shredded cabbage and diced tomato( probably the equivalent of three grape tomatoes) made up the balance of the meal !  This would have been unacceptable as an appetizer  and was outrageous as an entree !
My husbands burrito had an unpleasant aftertaste for hours after.
There are no circumstances under which I would  return to this restaurant !

{"text":"Cam & I love to eat local. We picked out this little gem because when in the west, you eat Mexican. It was so weird because what we consider Mexican at home and authentic Mexican are totally different. 

Do yourself a favor and get the guac. We're both pretty plain Janes and got it with just tomatoes and cilantro. Super yum. We also both got chicken tacos and the freshness was mind blowing!

The service was fab! We had this adorable lady whose name I can't remember. She was a doll."}
{"text":"Margaritas were amazing, table side guac was also quite delicious, everything else was just okay. The patio ambience was authentic and festive! I suggest going for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks back and was quoted a 15 minutes wait time that ended up being 45. Then when we were sat our waitress was no where to be found. The heater didn't work above our table. Food came out so so so slow. We would have done double the drinks but things took too damn long. Food was good and the waitress was nice, just spread too thin."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a more or less tranditional Mexican restaurant, done in upscale tones, and set in a fairly nice part of downtown Scottsdale.  About half of the tables are outside with views of the shops and, depending on the time of day, people walking by.  

The thing that distinguishes Barrio Queen is that they have talent in the kitchen.  Everything we tried was a surprise, usually a good one.  This is a magic restaurant - nothing is what it seems.  

For example, the Menudo is actually a much harder to find and exotic dish - Pata y Mondongo - tripe and calves' hooves.  Served in a slightly spicy tomato broth, it is exceptional.  Then there is the Chile Verde, a large portion of remarkably tender chunks of pork with a few onions and chilis, cilantro sprinkled on top, and just enough broth to keep it moist.  Nearly a meal in itself, it is a far cry from most chiles you will get in restaurants.

The Chiles en Nogado is a stuffed chili with a mixture of chicken chunks, dried apricot, onion, and garlic.  The surprise here is that the other ingredients listed on the menu were present, if at all, in only tiny amounts.  The result was a dish with good but simple flavor, lacking the complexities it should have.  The sauce was a overly-mild cream sauce with a couple of slivered almonds and added nothing.  Still it was enjoyable for what it was, just a bit disappointing for $22.

The only real miss was the Tres Leches dessert.  Once more a surprise but this time a very bad one.  This is really strawberry shortcake with just enough condensed milk (or something) to make the flavorless pound cake into a mush resembling bad oatmeal.  If not for this, I could have given Barrio Queen five stars.

HINT:  This place is busy even on weekdays.  If outside seating is not attractive due to heat, cold, wind, or rain, you very likely will have to wait.  As far as I can tell, they do not take reservations.  Parking can also be a problem."}
{"text":"First visit to Gilbert's new downtown Barrio Queen Mexican restaurant. Excellent Cochinita Pibil tacos!! Two for $3 during Happy Hour. And the chips and marinated pulled pork Carnitas Chile Verde are mild, smooth and delicious. Be sure to top it off with their Casa Margaritas!! Add some of their red sauce to the Chile Verde and it will be perfect! Just enough kick!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked my meal here.  I went with a group of coworkers.  We had the nachos & guacamole.  The guacamole had pomegranates in it.  A different touch & healthy!  About half of the group liked that addition & half didn't appreciate them.  

2 of us got the Suiza enchiladas.  I really liked them.  It had the Oxacada (spelling) cheese on them!  The last time I had that cheese was the last time I was in Mexico.  I thought they were delicious!   They only draw back was the portions were too large & since we were on a business trip, we couldn't take them home in a doggie bag.

Yum!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has very good food, however the service needs improvements. The man who was serving us was a little  rude, and the woman at the desk had an attitude. I do have to say that the pineapple agua fresca and the churros are must haves! May I also add that I found a huge bone in my tacos. Also, it was VERY loud inside this restaurant. Three stars."}
{"text":"Went to Barrio Queen for lunch for the first time..had a couple of carne asada tacos n rice they were pretty good. I also tried the nachos they were delicious!! The staff was friendly and can't wait to return soon.."}
{"text":"Great food. Absolutely love this place for the food and it's more authentic than other places. Prices are a little high especially for
Drinks so maybe not the place to go if you want to get several drinks with friends but good quality food!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen always has a great ambiance to it and tons of great people. Our server was named Devri which is a unique name in my book. She was a great sever and made sure to always stop by and refill our waters and check in on us. I only ordered a beer and had the chips and salsa since I had eaten previous to me and my wife going out but she ordered the shrimp enchiladas which is her favorite. The food always looks and taste amazing here. Normally I order Al Pastor which is my favorite as well as there guacamole with pomegranate seeds. It's always a good time at Barrio Queen and would recommend it to anyone who has never been."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was terrible but the food was so good we decided to try it again. As soon as we thought we were going to get bad service again Armando came over and helped us in very specific detail, patience , and absolutely kind. This server deserves employee of the year because I saw nobody walk as fast as him. I love Barrio Queen now and I will only sit in his section ."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment to Mexican food. You couldn't pay me to come back here. The food was disappointing and the service was weak. Can't wait to see what replaces this dump in a few months."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Our service was quick and food was great. (I also had no worries of gluten since they use corn tortillas). Our server Ana was super sweet and made our guacamole right in front of us. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight! The appetizers and drinks were the star of the show for sure. We had Elote Fries and Nachos, both were awesome. Unfortunately, it is 110 degrees at 8pm, and it doesn't seem that the bar area where we were sitting had any AC at all. It had to be 90 degrees in there, and we were seated very close to the kitchen. My sister and I had the 3 tacos plate and all our tacos came out cold :( the side of rice and beans were also not even warm. The service was good and fast, however, and our server was kind enough to split the check and fix a mistake made. 
I'd try again on a cooler day, and speak up if my food comes out cold."}
{"text":"I read a previous review that said when they first walked in a blonde girl just starred at them and then grabbed some menus and said this way. I had to laugh because that's exactly what happened when we went. There were two girls up front and it became awkward quick when they both seemed confused and didn't say anything. I almost just sat us myself!

It wasn't super busy but it seemed loud. The music they played fit the scenery but it was a bit much. I'd heard good things about this place so my expectations were high. We ordered the Arizona burrito and a bunch of tacos. It was just ok. I've had way better. Everything lacked salt and the fish tacos were super bland. Not worth $3.50 a taco.

I was really in the mood for Mexican food but maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff. I'm glad we tried this place out though because I can say I've been there now."}
{"text":"First time here on Taco Tuesday.  Tacos $2.50!  Tried 3 different kinds. The pork Conchinita Pibl taco was the best one!"}
{"text":"We went twice while in Scottsdale on vacation, we loved it! We got to go on taco tuesday, got cheap margs and beer, and cheap tacos. We both tried 4 different tacos each, they were amazing. I loved that we were able to choose 1 of each, unlike many restos who only let you choose one type. The drinks were great also.

OH yeah, the Nachos!!! Those are the best we've ever tried, and a huge serving at a low cost."}
{"text":"Good service. Food is okay. Some might say they are overpriced street tacos at 4 bucks each or 3 for 11. Ambiance is  great. Will probably not go back but if someone suggested it I wouldn't fight it. Coconuts has better fish tacos."}
{"text":"So far in Phoenix this has been the only Mexican restaurant I've been to and I've been twice. I have been working here for a month and a half and love this place for Mexican. Also the bartender is bomb as hell. I can't remember his name, but super attentive and helpful. Sat at the bar both times and had the same bartender. 

I am from Texas (San Antonio) originally so always love some good Mexican food. I love their tacos and their margaritas. I've had the following items:

Cocktel de Elóte - so yummy and just as I would expect Elóte. I ordered it as a side when I got tacos. 

Barrio Papas - I got half and half of the toppings. I will be honest the Elóte style topping was better. But I enjoyed the topping more than the fries. They are steak cut fries and just more filling than anything. Not super yummy for the amount of fullness they give you. Didn't care for the pork green chili topping much at all.

3 Tacos (Al Pastor, Barrio Pollo con Chorizo, & Carnitas) - Al pastor is a go to for me and it came out great. wasn't too saucey at all. The Barrio Pollo con Chorizo was recommended by the bartender and it was AMAZING. If you love the flavor of chorizo it's a must get! Carnitas I don't usually get and this reminded me why. They are usually dry and flavorless. 

Suizas Enchiladas - the second time I went this was recommended by the bartender and he said it was his favorite by far. I was TOTALLY impressed and blown away by these enchiladas. Again you get the enchiladas topped with Chorizo which I love and hadn't had any where else!! It is so damn good! You can taste the cheeseness melted also. so freaking yummy!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a day in Tombstone. 123 degrees. Very thirsty. Stopped here and sat on patio. Only 104 here. Misters were on high so extremely comfortable. Had margaritas and tacos. The chips/salsa...fantastic. The margaritas wonderful. The taco dinner, mui delicio"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try if you are around.
I'm torn between a 3 and 4 star review. Here's why:

Good: Torta, guacamole (sort of)
Less good: Chips, guacamole

Good torta's are always hard to find and this one was among the best I've had outside of Baja.

Guacamole is made table side and is fresh and flavorful...but we were left with a bowlful of huge chunks of avocado, like basically two big pieces of avo. Had to crush it the rest of the way. No, not a life-ending problem, but just sort of weird.

Chips were flavorless and seemed day-old. Bummer."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, very very unfriendly bartenders. Couldn't even believe how rude they were, didnt even get my drink for me. Ive been here Before and I've had great service and great food, so I don't know what happened with these guys. Terrible."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. We had a party of ten on a Sunday. Service was good, I don't remember her name but she was attentive and friendly. The food was extremely underwhelming, oh on top of that 6 out of 10 of our groups food came out ice cold.  Only two of us sent it back because everyone was so hungry. After about two minutes of sending it back our food came back out, guess what it was still cold. I mean were we going to send it back again? The best part is a manager never even touched the table. Personally I won't be back and neither will anyone I was with."}
{"text":"This is the second night they were open so we knew there could be come kinks to work out but what we had in store for us was more than a few kinks. First off we put our name in for a 25 minute wait and asked if we could grab a drink at the bar,  we did and then when we walked out on the gorgeous patio they asked us if we wanted to sit on these lovely sofas and wait (classy). When we sat down for dinner we were so excited to try everything, we ordered the corn appetizer and the nachos, my Husband ordered the carne Asada burrito, I ordered one fish and one shrimp taco and our server even put my Son's chicken tacos in first. My Husband got his burrito first, loved it. We waited a good 15 minutes for my Sons food and then another 20 for my tacos (which turned out to be the wrong order-fried not grilled) and finally our appetizers came out. They redeemed themselves by comping the entire check. The food was delicious and our Server was wonderful so we will definitely be back and are happy to have this new gem in our neighborhood. Thank you Barrio Queen for making what could have been disappointing turn out to be an incredible evening!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon around 2 or 3. Sat at the bar. Bartender (Dakota) was great. Fast and Efficient. It was buisy and he still made time to talk tacos and tequila. Food was good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The taco menu is amazing & so unique. This is not typical AZ Mexican food (it's more gourmet). It reminded me of another restaurant at The Quarter. I only had the tacos so I can't speak for the rest of the menu. They had tons to choose from. One had blue cheese on it. There was one with a fried egg.  Margarita was good. We went during happy hour. Got 10 tacos & 2 drinks for $33. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here. That's all I have ever ordered. It's pretty busy in the evenings so expect to wait a bit for your table. Good place to go with kids bc it's noisy. Jalapeño cucumber margarita it really yummy! Hostesses were not too bright. The rest of the staff was on point."}
{"text":"Our families favorite not only because of the delicious food but the BEST waiter in Arizona Taylor H! He was our first waiter when we moved here from Downtown Chicago in 2016. He is so friendly and makes us feel so welcome every time we come here! Taylor is what makes us come back to Barrio Queen!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican place in the Valley.  Very good plates, and cocktails.  Their quac and elote are superb!  You can't go wrong with anything.  Love the tacos as well."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has amazing food period. I recommend the Arizona Burrito or the choose your 3 tacos. Great spot for both large parties and small groups. The location makes it an easy spot to get to and I appreciate the parking lot in the back to help with Old Town parking!"}
{"text":"I paid 10 dollars for spiceless guac. The chips were good, but we ended up just throwing away our entrees"}
{"text":"I've given lots of high/low reviews. This one is towards the middle. You can't nail them on anything in particular, either good or bad. The menu is aiming high(er). The food (what I had) is not bad at all, but then it's not cheap. It certainly didn't blow my mind; nowhere close. I think this is just the place you go for a date or to drink alcohol and to see and be seen. If that's your priority, then you'll probably be plenty satisfied. Then again, that would make you a narcissistic bleach-blonde sock-puppet incapable of good taste. 

I certainly got the feeling from the waitstaff that I was being ranked, and when the bill was not adding up quickly enough, their attention drifted away from me. I kinda hate that, especially since I worked in restaurants, and I know that tips are a self-fulfilling prophecy most of the time. 

Anyway, not hitting them too hard, because everyone just managed to do what they had to within a slim margin of error. No real complaints. 

Enjoy those margaritas, sock-puppets!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, definitely not as good as the original, Barrio Cafe. I don't think the head of Barrio Cafe is even associated with this spot anymore. My main issue with Barrio Queen is their service. It has been very hit or miss and with all the restaurants in the area I think their wait staff should be able to do a better job. 

I will say that their location is great and I do like the outside seating. I typically go to this location for lunch when I'm in the area. If I want the real thing I will always travel to downtown Phoenix for the real thing."}
{"text":"The food was quite good.I had the chille rellleno with vegetables.it was an Interesting mix of flavors.  The service was really good. Sherrie took great car of our huge group"}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks are average at best. Staff is not very friendly at the bar.  I've been there a few times to give it more than one chance. Live in the area and probably will not go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"Went on a date night of Friday night. I wouldn't say it was too busy we waited only about 7 minutes for a table. However once we were seated it took forever for our server to talk to us and we literally waited 30 minutes for water! Our appetizer ended up being served to us before we even got water, chips and salsa. Our server was nice but not very attentive. I think especially on Friday nights they should have dedicated guacamole makers and not have the servers pull double duty. The food was good but it's hard to overlook poor service."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 or 5 times now and have always had a great experience every time food and service is exceptional. Tacos are absolutely amazing. I even had a child who did not want Mexican food but guess what they have hot dogs on their menu. A little something for everybody even vegetarians..... One thing I was disappointed was when my check came 3 of us were charged $3 each for the rice. When he took our order he asked if we wanted rice or beans not saying it was an extra charge.  If I had known it was an extra charge all 3 of us could have shared one helping because it was brought out on a separate tray."}
{"text":"Not impressed. To start, the chips were cold, thick, and tasteless, but they are complimentary so it is what it is.

Their margarita menu has some delicious sounding concoctions, but be ready to pay for it. I tried the Queens cooler at the suggestion of our sever. It was really, really bad.  It reminded me of Malibu rum mixed with the cheapest tequila you can find.  It is expensive considering how weak it is (go get your buzz somewhere else...)

They have an extensive taco menu. Between my husband and myself, we tried about 8 different tacos and honestly we wouldn't come back for them... soggy and boring. 

I brought home a chicken quesadilla for my mother and honestly it was delicious! Yes, that's right - the chicken quesadilla (boring old chicken and cheese) was the best thing we tried all night.  

I will say that the hostess was friendly and our server was up eat, nice, and attentive.  The bus boys did a good job keeping our table clear too."}
{"text":"So this is the second chance review
We have been here before. They were honestly super busy for it being a Tuesday evening, so we had high hopes that this was the place to be. 
However we left feeling a bit different. 
So avoiding it for almost a month we have come back for a late Saturday dinner. 
I'm actually sitting in the restaurant right now. Initially we are told by Chaz our server that we have a second server. 
It's her first night on her own so be nice! Of course! I was a server for 6 years before so always! 
Well we ordered the table side guacamole. The reviews seemed great about it. She (unnamed cause she is new) prepared it initially putting on gloves then took the gloves off, I'm watching others prepare it after at other tables and they HAVE GLOVES ON! I'm worried at this point, especially when you are touching food I will eat and I cannot verify when you last washed your hands! 
Then we ask Chaz to please finish mashing our guacamole as it literally is like chunks of avocado with sprinkles. He said they don't have anything to mash it with, this is how they serve it, then he returns saying he took care of it himself with a fork in the back. Okay well it tasted great either way I'll say that. Then we get our food, meh nothing to rave about we both had enchiladas. Not bad, not stellar. However we also sat here for a good 15 mins with empty drinks, at least 5 people walked past our table and didn't even bother to offer a refill. Finally she (unnamed) made it back and let us know that she would bring us another drink. 
I was almost headed to the bar with our empty glasses to beg for a refill of soda!
Really? I was hoping this time would be better."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. Nice Patio. Friendly service.  Very cool place. 
Had the chicken enchiladas. They were good but I was hoping there would be something that set them apart from other Mexican cuisine. 
I think I will try one of their more signature dishes next time. 
I want to go back and try again. The patio looks like it would be great place for a happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"The chorizo taco with egg is life changing. Flavorful combination like I've never experienced. Guacamole is great too. Our server Ana made it fun. Kudos to her. Definitely coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Service great. Food, not so great.  I had heard that this was \"the place\" for Mexican food. Nope.  Nothing here was memorable or even worth mentioning.  Not going back."}
{"text":"My 2 cents: WTF kind of mexican place does not serve salsa?  

We met a group of 10 here for a bday dinner/ drinks patio thing on a Saturday night.  I was looking forward to trying it after looking at the menu online.  I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.  We had a few apps, guac that was nice but not better than Gallo Blanco or the Mission, and a few quesadillas.  When I flagged down our server to ask for salsa with our aracherra quesadilla, she looked apologetic as she explained that they do not serve salsa, just Tapatio in the bottle.  Excuse me?  It's like the chef's saying a big F You!, my food is so good it doesn't need salsa.  I can assure you though, it was definitely lacking some flavor that a well executed salsa or two could have provided.  I felt cheated.  I will go to a place based on their salsa appeal alone.  It's a crime akin to a sushi restaurant saying they do not serve soy sauce, it just doesn't make sense.  

The service could have been a little better, but it was a Saturday night, and we were a big group keeping them busy with cocktail orders, so it was forgivable.  I did ask for the consolation prize Tapatio which never came.  Although I am admittedly salsa obsessed, even others in my party commented on how weird the salsa prohibition was.  Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos, he thought they were dry and were definitely missing something in there.  Four tacos also came out on one plate, with no side plates, even though two different gentleman ordered them.  When we asked the food runner about it, he said everything was \"family style\".  You know how dudes are with their food, especially when you are sitting at opposing ends of the table and don't really know each other \"family style\" well.  I teased my friend seated next to me that I hoped other dude washed his hands before handling his tacos in the family style melee, but I digress.  

The highlight of the experience was the Michelada I ordered with Modelo Especial which was made perfectly.  Probably one of the best I have ever had.  I ordered a second one, and this is definitely something I could envision myself coming back for, maybe during happy hour.  I know we didn't try any of the more complex dinner items, but really - I just can't get past the salsa ban so I doubt I will in the future."}
{"text":"Love the Barrio Queen- good service, great food and atmosphere is fun! We love \"Taco Tuesdays\"!! If you are in the Gilbert area, be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from Barrio Queen twice. The first time we ordered both the Caldo Tlalpino (Chicken Soup) and the Pozole Verde.  Both were good, but such tiny portions that I thought it must have been a mistake.  $8 and $9 respectively for barely a cup of soup is ridiculous, no matter how good it is, and both were very flavorful.    We also ordered  the Barrio Pollo burrito, which was quite good, although slightly underseasoned.  

Although the prices are so high, we decided to give Barrio Queen another try, this time leaving out the insanely expensive soup.  

  We had the guacamole, which was decent, somewhat bland, but insanely overpriced for the small amount. For $10.75 we were expecting a portion large enough to share,  but it barely satisfied two of us.  We definitely would have wanted more, were the accompanying tortilla chips not thick and almost too hard to bite through.  

We had a side of veggies, which was mostly zucchini and corn, completely unseasoned. Along with that we ordered the Azteca burrito in anticipation of the \"delicately slow-roasted beef brisket\".   Instead we got a pile of flavorless chewy strings.   But the best was the part where we suddenly began pulling hairs out of our mouths.   The burrito was literally loaded with human hair.  Can you hear us gagging?  I am still gagging as I write this review.

I complained about the food through the review function of Door Dash, the delivery service, which quickly responded with a credit for our next purchase and a promise to forward the complaint to the restaurant, so we waited for a response from Barrio Queen, but none has been forthcoming.   That does not indicate the kind of customer care and concern for quality that one would expect from an expensive restaurant like Barrio Queen.  

Not recommended if you like to receive value for what you pay for, but highly recommended for those who enjoy chewing on long greasy strands of black hair along with your bland and overcooked highly priced food."}
{"text":"Multiple visits...one of my favorite places to eat.  The space is open and airy, food continues to please.  A menu that changes often enough to supply interest, and professional staff who are invested and engaged.  Thanks Queen!

Most recent visit focused on Chiles en Nogado, aided by Chipotle mashed potatoes and Calabacitas which paired nicely.  Textures, flavors, quantity, were balanced and welcoming.  Finished with light dessert and a smile.  Thanks, Taylor, our knowledgeable and friendly server."}
{"text":"First off, we almost didn't even come here because of all the recent, terrible reviews!! So glad we gave this place a chance ... great food, drinks, and service!! We had the elote fries which are interesting but good - happy I tried them!! I ordered three tacos: pollo, carne asada, and the shrimp!! They were some of the best tacos I have ever had and despite previous reviews there were two large shrimp in my shrimp taco (tortillas are small so two was more then plenty).  My husband ordered the ceviche and thought it was very good!! Salsa and chips were delicious and margaritas are on point - the coconut margarita (not sure of the actual name) was the best margarita I have ever had!! Wish We would have ordered the gauc, made table side, but now have an excuse to go back haha!! We went with very low expectations and left wondering how half of these reviews were written!! Definitely give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I had the peach margarita which was recommended as the best marg on the menu by the bartender. It was not very good. I would not go to this restaurant again. I would go back to Blanco!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and glad we did. 
From the table side fresh made guacamole, to the queso fundido, and the jalapeño margaritas, this place was fantastic. They have large portions of good food, friendly staff, and a good environment for everyone."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The meat was perfectly spiced and the churros filled with sweetened goats milk were to die for. I had to hold myself back from gathering a plateful. I polished the night off with a beautiful coconut margarita. Well done, Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a great example of a restaurant where your experience is highly dictated by what your order. Some of their tacos are better than others, but the best was the barrio pollo con chorizo taco. The supposedly award winning conchinita pibil and the al pastor were average. The ambiance of the restaurant is positive, but it may take a few visits to ensure you will like what you are ordering."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with tonight's meal! We were sat pretty quickly (5 of us on a Saturday) and was immediately greeted by the best server I may have ever had. We ordered the guacamole... and I must say this was absolutely mouth watering. I then got their signature meal and thought it lacked a bit of flavor but I'm also not the biggest pork fan. I loved the environment and service. I would get the enchiladas next time because everyone at my table who got them loved them!"}
{"text":"Waitress sucked was so rude took forever to get food!!! Never going back! Waste of my Sunday night!!"}
{"text":"Overall just not the greatest experience honestly. 

I spend a lot of time in this area of Gilbert because of the restaurants. I had high expectations because I love JoyRide which is across the street. 

Myself and a friend came in around 730 or 8 and it wasn't as busy as I expected which is always nice. We were sat pretty quickly, had chips and salsa brought to us, and than we waited. 

We waited for about 15 minutes before someone came over and took our drink orders. And then we waited.....10 minutes or so go by and our drinks show up. 

Our server was polite, but just never could find her. After she dropped off our drinks she took our orders and again, we waited. There's a reoccurring theme here. 

We were sat close to the kitchen, where all the servers congregated and were talking loudly about things that had nothing to do with their customers or restaurant. If you are going to blatantly ignore work and talk obnoxiously loud, at least hide in the kitchen and do it. 

The food was okay, I had a few tacos and they were decent. I just feel like maybe I expected too much out of this play and thus, was let down. Also, I was just put off by the service and the clear nonchalant attitude by the employees."}
{"text":"We were ignored by the host upon arriving for at least 10 minutes. Place had maybe 4 other customers. Next, I took my napkin off of my silverware to reveal a fork wrapped in an old and large wilted piece of lettuce. Worse than all of this was our food: cold, dry, and totally flavorless. The meat in my cold carnitas had came from the walk-in without much attempt at reheating, and my wife's enchiladas were cartoonishly horrible with hardly a trace of anything but spinach, and were cold. We waited a long time too, just to get cold and tasteless food. Even the lime on each of our beers was old and had already turned brown along the cut edges. Flies, gnats, and trash all over the floor. Food and service here were embarrassing and ruined an important moment for us. We barely ate and I was relieved that the little I did consume didn't cause food poisoning. Such a let-down."}
{"text":"I've only really been here for happy hour but they have an awesome feel for margaritas! We also ordered some chips and guacamole and enjoyed. The bartenders were friendly and the place was happy and full of life!"}
{"text":"My fiancé wanted to try this place so I caved in. It ended up being very good- the chips and salsa were good, drinks were good, and we both loved our tacos. The ambience is nice too! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the service. I'm a former waitress myself so I'm pretty understanding, but our server forgot about our drinks- twice- and by the time he remembered the 2nd time we asked it be taken off the bill as we had already finished eating. Would love to go back, but will need to prepare for patience."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican options in the area in my opinion.  They really do a nice job with their enchiladas.   My favorite is the mole enchiladas - you get 3 good sized enchiladas with a side of vegetables.   Reasonably priced at around 15 bucks for a meal.  Service has been great both times."}
{"text":"My go to for tacos. Ive eaten dinner here almost every Tuesday night since moving to AZ. We've been dubbed the \"taco Tuesday\" club. Great house margaritas and barrio pollos! Ask for Ron or Arturo as your waiter and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Los Tacos. I count 46 diverse, hand-made soft tortilla tacos, recipes from around The United Mexican States. 

So I begin with getting my drink on. Tequila with a beer chaser. I choose to do shots of a reposado. Clase Azul 22. A rich full aroma with a nice smooth mouthfeel that leads to a full body. Slight hints of caramel vanilla and very little alcohol burn. Super satisfying. Produced in Jalisco from the highlands in the heart of Mexico. 

My chaser, Victoria beer 5. Copper color with a gentle taste and a smooth, crisp finish. This beer has an authentic history and is a kept secret. Newly arrived to the States maybe no more than a year, this beer has become my favorite Mexican Import.

The staff and I are warming up to each other. Colton and Ron keep me company, they are great. I see Chef Silvana and ask for a moment and introduce myself. Chef Silvana graciously sits with me for a few moments and I begin to learn what I need, to order 5 distinct tacos. I order them one or two at a time. 

#1 al pastor, marinated pork with pinapple slice 2.50.
#2 arrachera con champiñon y huiltiacoche, grilled flank steak with sauteed mushrooms and diced shalot and huitlacoche, the mexican corn truffle, an earthy and somewhat smoky fungus. 4. This was my favorite taco.
#3 nopal y chile verde, cactus and pork green chile. 3. 
#4 milanesa y salsa cruda, breaded pork with raw chile lime pickled salsa. 3.75
#5 arabe, marinated pork with cucumber salsa on a flour tortilla. 3.50.

I'm ready for Chef Silvana's homemade gourmet pastries made daily. I have a chocolate cookie and a flaky lemon filled roll. 5. both absolutely delicious.

My service was excellent but this is not unusual for me. Pure Mexican ambience and trusted receipes that come from all over the Mexican countryside, it doesn't get any better. Thank you Chef.

Feliz Año Nuevo, feliz y próspero Año Nuevo mis amigos y amigas."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had I was sitting at the bar with a couple coworkers when a Caucasian lady comes in because I'm Hispanic demanded to me to teach her how to speak Spanish it was obvious the lady was drunk and I'm upset with Barrio queen who decided to keep serving this drunk patron who kept on harassing us. I strongly advise to boycott this location who allows this kind of behavior to go on in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I cannot describe this food I am surprised when I drive by and see The restaurant filled to capacity I am pretty sure everyone is ordering alcohol, that would be the only way you can actually stomach the food!!! The concept of the restaurant is great and that's about it. If they don't change soon I have a feeling they won't be around much longer. Do yourself and your bowels a favor and keep walking I am sure you will find something else that will stay with you longer than 30 minutes after you eat it."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY overpriced. Food was terrible and service was no better. I can't understand why people eat at this place."}
{"text":"This is our 4th visit to Barrio Queen since they opened and it has been fantastic every time! Today was beautiful out so for the first time, we dined outside. They have a great misting system, but most days here in summer, that's just not enough! Today however it was a lovely experience. My daughter ordered the Arizona Burrito and I had the appetizer order of seasoned fries with green chile pork. Ah.May.Zing! We actually go back each time just for those loaded up fries. Delicious!! The food was hot, fresh, attractively displayed and tasty as always. Portions large and fairly priced. Service, as always, was top notch! Our server Sherrie was attentive and very friendly. Brought refills without prompting, offered to go cup without our having to ask and cleared empties so our table stayed unobstructed and pleasant throughout. They can get busy during peak times but it's still worth the effort. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I was in town from California for about 24 hours to help a friend move and she brought us here for lunch and margaritas.  The house margarita was very good, you can taste that they use good tequila in the house margarita.  The taco selection was amazing! I tried 3 different tacos and they were all delicious and authentic! They all tasted like the ones I've had in Mexico and that my grandmother used to make me.  The chips were homemade and the salsa has such great flavor. My only recommendation is to maybe make the salsa with a little bit of heat. There was no heat to it, however make sure you squeeze lime into the salsa because it does make it more flavorful! I will be back when I'm in town again! Definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Kadee was attentive and efficient. She made a great suggestion of choosing the Michelada Chingona over the regular. She was right, we had both and the Chingona was awesome. We had the Elote, Table side guac and ceviche to start. The battered fish taco was better than Joy Ride to me. We had 2 bowls of Pozole Verde which reminded my wife of her moms homemade Pozole. You cant get a much better compliment than that! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened! The atmosphere looked really cool and I like the Dia de Los Muertos theme throughout the restaurant. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Ordered the Elote appetizer, which that I loved! I got the carnitas and a friend ordered the chilaquiles. For a big skillet I only got 3 tortillas which left me eating the rest with a fork, they were much drier than what I'm used to and the rice and beans tasted like they were cooked straight from a box. The chilaquiles....paying the price we did for basically a plate full of chips lightly covered in salsa. Have I mentioned how pricey this place is?! I could have gone anywhere else and paid half the price for much better meals. At least now I know I paid $55 for an atmosphere and not the food. Will I go back? No."}
{"text":"Food was great but extremely messy. Did not expect to pay $36 for a pitcher of Sangria that was mostly ice, at happy hour pricing. Getting an appetizer, 6 STREET tacos and a pitcher of Sangria should not cost $70, EVER."}
{"text":"Located in charming Scottsdale. 
Loved this restaurant. It's prefect for groups or casual date. Patio seating has heated lamps throughout so you can enjoy patio dining even when the sun has gone down. Extensive tequila selection. Fantastic menu. Nice bar tables and bar seating. Unique menu. There is something for everyone here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about dining here. A friend of ours chose this place for her birthday celebration and she raved about it, but the 3 1/2 stars had me a bit worried. I am a 4 star or higher kind of girl...life is too short to waste it on mediocre food. I started with the Queen's Cooler which was tasty, but for $9 I felt it could have been a tad stronger. We ordered the Barrio Guacamole...yummy, but just like Barrio Cafe! I was hoping they would be a little unique in this department. Chile Verde was my dinner choice and the word that comes to mind is meh!! First of all they served it on a skillet so I expected it to be hot...it wasn't. The server even said be careful the skillet is hot. Slightly warm? Maybe. But definitely not hot. I hate eating barely warm food! The flavor? Just okay. Desert was their only saving grace. Mexican Bread Pudding...that I would go back for! Overall experience? Not impressed!! insert sad face here"}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we will absolutely be back! Everything was muy deliciso! Ask for Sherrie, she's awesome at the guacamole tableside service and has a great personality"}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience of our visit to Scottsdale. They told us we had an hour wait for 7 of us, which is totally cool. We decided to sit just outside the door and have $18 cocktails and appies while we waited. Waiter was sweet but it was so loud we didnt hear the text. We were like 10 minutes before we saw it. Mind you we are right out front of the reservation check in ( about 15 steps) and nobody thought to come get us. They gave our table away and told us we had to wait again. SERIOUS. OMG, the manager was the biggest a$$hole and knows nothing about customer service. We already spent $130 for drinks and they didnt think we deserved to be seated. We would have spent a lot of money and have never been treated so bad. We would have walked and not paid after the way they treated us but would never leave the kind waiter holding the bill. So we paid but decided it wasnt worth waiting and decided to leave and go somewhere else. Will NEVER go back and recommended you do not go there. They do not appreciate their patrons."}
{"text":"Came here while spending a few days in Scottsdale and was excited to try this place after a family recommendation.  I have to say the ambience was great as there was a good sized crowd both in the indoor and outdoor seating areas . The waiter was attentive and most important of all the food was delicious ! This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been too and hope to return for another great meal during my next visit to Arizona !"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience here.  We sat at the bar.  The margaritas were fabulous, tacos were tasty and interesting and the bartender well- trained and informative.  It was definitely worth the 20 minute wait to get in.  This is a great place to sit on the patio and enjoy the weather or sit inside and enjoy to cool decor.  Either way - great spot.
Finally a decent restaurant to go to in Desert Ridge!!!"}
{"text":"Service way below average. We had to ask for silverware. I asked for a fruity drink and the drink I was given that the waitress recommended was horrible and not fruity at all. And she never took the drink off my table after I told her I didn't like it. You don't have to take it off my bill but get rid of it. Bad experience all around. Food was very average. Overpriced street tacos."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Was a little iffy about going because of the wide range of reviews but it was a great lunch. Very flavorful food and everything was extremely fast. Will definitely return and tell others."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time here. Very friendly, efficient service and a fun, hip ambiance. 
I ordered the hearty Queen's Salad (Baby greens, grilled chicken breast, apples, roasted tomatoes, toasted pecans, queso fresco, and roquefort cheese with a sweet and spicy vinaigrette. Garnished with pomegranate seeds). It was excellent. We all ordered lunch-time Happy Hour margaritas, which were $3.50 at the time and they packed a real punch (wow!). The Barrio Queen provided us with excellent food, service, and value. Who could ask for more? We shall return."}
{"text":"Delicious but expensive!$$$$ I grew up in East L.A. and never considered paying more than $5 for a chille relleno. Today I paid $22 for one and $20 more for a small margarita.  Delicious but not worth it at all. A rich person's version of Mexican food. Actually, it's probably a fine business model for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a large party of people and more kept showing up.  They didn't provide more tables and the musters went off at 8pm.  Thus, we had an overcrowded table on a hot evening with no misters.  The manager came over and said she couldn't add tables
Due to fire code.  We made reservations for 20 and we didn't have 20 people but they wouldn't add room. 

Then the misters went off at 8pm.  There was more people showing up after 8pm and there was no room to sit inside.  We were hot and would have had a dessert but bit after the treatment we got from the manager.

The food was good and our waiter, Fernando, was fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, the service was poor. Sat at the bar. 2 servers, one chopping limes while talking to a friend for 20 mins. Other walked by me several times (minimum 4 times) without asking about my meal, did I need anything. Had to ask for chips. Both servers were talking with friends and ignoring everyone else. Actually tried to give me someone else's receipt with their credit card and I hadn't even gotten my bill yet. His service was reflected in the tip"}
{"text":"Too expensive. Hardly any carne in the carne asada burrito and I got a margarita that no one told me cost fifteen (15) god damn dollars."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Barrio Queen. We came on a Friday night and we're seated right away. All four of us enjoyed what we ordered. My favorite was the Chiles en Nogada. The diversity of the ingredients make it look interesting on the menu, but it tastes amazing. I've seen quite a few reviews about the guac, so we tried that as well and it wasn't great. The pomegranate makes it a little too sweet. The tacos, the enchiladas, and the camarones were all very good and our waiter was on point."}
{"text":"Have tried twice to go for dinner. Once on a Friday and tonight a Saturday. Over an hour wait and you can clearly see empty tables which tells us they do not staff well on weekends. Both times we got right in with a competitor with excellent food and service. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how amazing this place is! Guacamole made fresh at your table, authentic Mexican that is A-MAZ-ING!!! The Al Pastor is great! Highly recommended and will be back."}
{"text":"Love the burrito and margarita but saw a roach on the bar counter crawling towards my plates. I quickly closed out my tap and left. Now, I can't think about going back to this place or the other restaurants in the same building. Major bummer."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuummmyyyyy this place is suuuuppper cute !!!!!!! It can be quite pricey that's for sure so prices are a little up there. But once in a while that's okay. Me and my best friend love coming in and having lunch/dinner occasionally! The hosts eh kinda all over the place and not so good at seating people. But food is delicious and the restaurant looks like art, it's such a fun and brightening environment ! I will keep coming back, Thankyou :)"}
{"text":"The food is way over rated.  Good but amateurish service.  We had to wave down the staff all dinner for chips and salsa, water, extra  drinks and our check.  The food was maybe one star plus.  Go to Los Sombreros for 
The real deal. I forgot, the chips were a massive grease pit.  They actually dripped when you took them out of the bowl."}
{"text":"So, I was skeptical of Barrio Queen when my wife suggested we try it.  That said the menu is packed full of a huge variety of items and flavor combinations and it was overwhelming.  So, I went with I though would be less risky, Brisket.  The Aztec Enchiladas were an absolutely surprising explosion of flavor!  I was blown away!  My wife had to stop eating her tacos and eat one they were so good.   Then the medley of vegetables were astounding as well... and the black beans and queso had a shocking kick!  Who knew?! This place was delightful if unexpected journey for the taste buds!  Our waitress Victoria was friendly and helpful, and was absolutely on top of my excessive downing of the tea I had ordered.  Very uncommon for me to give 5 stars, but this place nailed it!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Definitely not authentic Mexican food. Seems the flavors (or sometimes lack there of) appeal to this area of patron. Everything we ordered tasted the same (Pork Tinga, Puerco Verde Cup, Mini Tortas, Quesadilla con Pollo). 

Nice decor and patio area, but not enough to draw us back. We MUCH prefer Barrio Cafe in PHX."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It has such a fun atmosphere, and I loved the outdoor seating. The food and drinks are absolutely fantastic. The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of its extremely slow service. Luckily, we weren't I'm anrush, but even so, the service was unbelievably slow. To top it off, our server kept forgetting to bring is water after asking multiple times, and when he served my drink, he said he didn't like it at all. I understand if he didn't like the drink I chose, but we should not have commented that way. It made me not want to drink it, and o regretted ordering it. Hopefully, that's just it experience and not others'. Overall, it's a great place with great food as long as you don't mind a long wait."}
{"text":"Great food and easy to get to location, definately going to be coming back again. The tacos were small and well priced allowing for variety. The happy hour is worth the trip. The burritos are huge and plenty of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Barrio Queen in Gilbert for the 1st time today. We loved the decor and the service was very good and prompt. The food was really not very good. The chips are VERY thick and just weird. The salsa had a very strange flavor to it. My wife had the Carnitas Taco and a Brisket Taco. I had the Conchita Pabil, Brisket and Grilled Shrimp Tacos. The carnitas were dry and bland, The conchita Pabil was just not very good. The brisket was flavorful and had a bit of a nice spicy kick to it and the grilled shrimp taco was quite good. The size of the tacos was really lacking and in my opinion quite expensive. The tacos are $3.50 each or 3/$10. In my opinion there are better taco options VERY close to the Barrio Queen, I will not use the name in a review of the BQ as I think that would be rude, but It wouldn't be very hard for you to figure out with a small bit of research."}
{"text":"2nd visit and once again not impressed.  The table side guacamole is a total joke.  The salsa is about as flavorful as water!  Safe your money and visit Del-Taco"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great however the service at the bar is lacking and rough around the edges, one of the bartenders made a comment about banging senoritas, not what i care to hear when on a date. Unfortunately there are two other mexican restaurant in old town Los Olivos, and Frank and Lupes the service there is questionable as well, a smile and some sincerity goes a long way, its not rocket science people!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place! Service was great. Our waiter, Matt, was exceptional, and the food exceeded my expectations.  And the chips and salsa...WOW.  They also prepare their guacamole fresh at table-side.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"I did a Yelp search for Taco Tuesday and found this restaurant, which was a little too fancy for the average Taco Tuesday. Their \"taco tuesday\" deal means you get $1 off your already expensive tacos.. While they were deliciously gourmet, and exactly the unique flavor experience I was looking for, you could eat one taco in two bites. :/

Tacos were delicious but way too small, and overpriced for the size. If you go here for the tacos, I'd make a night of it. Get yourself an appetizer, a couple drinks, and dessert if you want to be be satisfied by the time you're done."}
{"text":"Good concept, after some practice they might have a good thing going here. As with most new restaurants they had some pretty serious service issues, but we managed through and enjoyed our meal overall. I'll be back in a few months."}
{"text":"Just had to leave the quiet bar at Barrio Queen because we basically had zero service. While the bartender focused on his buddies at the bar we managed to eat our meals with empty drinks. When we were able to get his attention and order refills he proceeded to clear plates elsewhere and refilled his friends drinks as we then continued to wait. We opted to cash out with empty drinks and empty plates sitting in front of us. We have typically have Barrio on the top of the list, but this location has dropped to the bottom with the horrible service. Go to one of the many options in Gilbert unless never getting served is your thing."}
{"text":"Hate to bash a new place, but this one is so bad that I have to.  Start off with hostess saying it will be a 30 minute wait.  OK with that.  Order to Don Julio margaritas - $37 for two drinks, two SMALL drinks.  OK fine.  Table ready in 10 minutes.  Better than quoted so great.  Waitress comes to table and is so unprofessional and poorly trained.  We order some tacos, a tortilla soup, and beans.  Soup comes out quickly but is not even close to hot.  Bad food temp = sickness.  Sent back.  Bring soup back hot, but left off avocado.  No server returns to ask for it.  OK fine.  Tacos show up - wrong order and food cold.  Request correct tacos.  Waitress takes whole plate back.  Brings back a mess of tacos on the plate...all cold.  Brings out beans that taste like they were on someone elses table.  Fat and grease coagulated on top of beans.  TERRIBLE.  Ask for manager.  He is CLUELESS and says the taco toppings are cold and not the fillings.  Basically arguing with me.  Says he will be right back.  Wait 10 minutes and he isn't.   Finally we just left...bummed that I paid nearly $40 for two drinks.  

The decor is fantastic, but this restaurant is so poorly managed it is ridiculous.  Has potential, but they need to train their staff.  Worst service I have ever had and cold food that was simply not very good."}
{"text":"I loved the Barrio Queen! Fabulous patio, super cool bar area inside, and a quirky, fun restaurant. This is the kind of place you can come with a group of friends, or just one really good one, order some margaritas, some tacos, more margaritas and spend the afternoon... Yes, our waitress was NOT good during our visit, but the waiter in our section more then made up for her short comings. And no it's not the most authentic Mexican resto around. But it's in a great location right off the canal in Old Town Scottsdale; all in all, I had a ton of fun and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First time visit. Chips and salsa were below average and disappointing, but the two entrees we ordered were quite tasty. My wife got the barrio pollo burrito. It was stuffed with excellent spices, chunks of chicken, and homemade cheese sauce. It was huge. She brought half of it home. I ordered their award winning pork torta. The tender pork was piled high and covered with pico and other spices.  I'd  go back."}
{"text":"Super cool Mexican restaurant in a great part of downtown.  The amazing guacamole was a surprise - I plan on copying their recipe with pomegranate seeds!  All of our entrees were delicious, and the waiter was very friendly and attentive.  Afterwards we walked around the cute downtown area and window shopped-it was a perfect evening."}
{"text":"I came for taco Tuesday with some friends ($2.50 per taco versus $3.50). The atmosphere was nice and the service was great. The tacos were average, nothing special. I had the carne asada, pescado and brisket tacos. Personally, I would rather go to some street vendor which sells authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our experience at this location. I have been to the Gilbert location once and it was okay. We were a larger party of 9 or 10 and called ahead but apparently they don't do reservations. So we arrived and waited about 45-50 minutes which was okay. While waiting we ordered drinks and some of us waters which we had a good experience with the bar staff and closed out with them as it is their policy. Once we got to our tables our waiter came around and asked for drink orders. Some of us ordered water and never received it. The waiter asked about ordering appetizers and we asked about the chips and salsa since in Gilbert they brought it to our table right away and the waiter told us they don't normally give us chips and salsa which was odd because every other table around us had chips on their table. The waiter then asked which one of us would foot the bill for the chips and salsa as if it was such an odd request. 

Then when it came time to order the waiter was upset at one group who had moved over one seat for three members who had shown up a little late which we let him know that we can help with any confusion and he seemed to be upset. When it came time to order he was sneering at one guest who didn't quite know what they wanted to order as if we were wasting his time. 

Once our food arrived I have to say I was really disappointed. The tacos were somewhat small and cold. My boyfriends burrito was good though. 

The most frustrating part is not once during the hour we sat there did we ever get water. I had an empty glass and asked twice for water and nothing. We asked another employee who was cleaning tables who finally brought us waters. After speaking to a manager he mentioned that it is not their policy to give guests water which seems so odd for a restaurant. The waiter just ruined our experience with his attitude and put us all off of this restaurant. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants that I will visit over this particular one again."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after passing by it a few times. We went for Taco Tuesday because I was craving Mexican, but this place fell way short. No chips and salsa at a Mexican place is just absurd. We paid $3 per taco for their Taco Tuesday price and I would never pay anymore than that. Not to mention they are street taco size so without chips and salsa I left a little hungry even after 3 tacos! 

Not impressed, we will continue to look for a good Mexican place for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"I love the art work probably more than the food but it's a toss up.  Both are wonderful.

Happy hour is a good deal and service is always spot on."}
{"text":"On Saturday May 26, my husband and I went to Barrio Queen and Kaleb was our server. Not only was he courteous, he made us feel welcome at the restaurant by going above and beyond to make sure my husband and I had everything we needed to enjoy our date night. 

The restaurant week menu featured our favorite elote corn, green chili and flan. The prices were reasonable as well. 

Barrio Queen is one of our new favorite places to go out and enjoy a meal. Kaleb made our visit to Barrio Queen that much more enjoyable. We will for sure return because of Kaleb and the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This review is just for Taco Tuesdays!!! I love the large selection of street taco's on the menu.  I go in about 2 Tuesdays a month for Taco Tuesdays!  I like them all, try them all!  4 taco's for $10 which is enough plus the chips and salsa they bring you.  Pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"Full review to be blogged:

With service efficient and gracious, one of many servers arrived with my first course - the two for $3 Happy Hour taco pairing of Nopal and Barrio Polo, plus a $4 addition entitled Champinon, huitlacoche, y cotija.  With the Nopal a downgraded version of the egg topped item on the standard menu served only at happy hour and featuring tender cactus with a bit of salt and pepper plus queso fresco atop a four inch corn tortilla I started with it expecting it to be the most mild and as anticipated, it was quite bland.  Moving next to better options, the Barrio polo featured the same warm and tender tortilla topped with chicken, onions, green chilis, and hefty cream sauce plus Oaxaca cheese while the corn smut iteration proved to be by far the most complex and balanced of the trio, the woodsy mushrooms and aromatic shallots heavily perfumed by the huitlacoche.  All in all a good start, but certainly not the best I've tasted and skewed far to the left in terms of cost/quality.

Curious as to how the pork at BQ stands up to others in the valley I next opted for the carnitas appetizer but was instead served a carnitas taco - cheaper at $3 compared to $9, but not what I'd asked for.  Not really wanting to make a fuss and figuring I could save the stomach capacity this was another decent taco - fatty pork with ample notes of marjoram, thyme, and garlic served with a light accompaniment of onions and cilantro...2 good bites, but nothing to write home about, especially when compared to what arrived with it.

Presented along with the carnitas, the \"El Rey Vasito de Elote\" is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature, this is pretty darn good.  Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, tapatio salsa, cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet, savory, and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors.  Served solo and meant to share this dish is also offered over fries, but for my money it was best taken by the spoonful alongside other plates or wrapped in a warm tortilla, free on request.

For my final round of savories I went with one of the weekend specials and an order from the 'masa' section of the menu and having expected more small plates I certainly got more than I'd expected from both.  Beginning first with the later, a dish called Tlacoyos arrived with three mashed corn fritters topped with smoky chicken, black beans, salsa verde, oregano, pickled onions, cotija cheese and lightly sweetened cream.  Having expected something more akin to a traditional corn fritter form the $9 plate what I really liked about this open-face interpretation was once again the balance - a composition of flavors and textures akin to the Elote but tilted further to the savory yet finishing with light sweetness imparted by the cream.

Moving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding.  Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal, bones, tender hominy, and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions, cilantro, lime, and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own.

Still with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet, one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita, entrée, or another half-gallon of menudo instead.

Beginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus, reportedly, \"Vanilla Kahlua sauce\" it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake, a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can.  As a further note, where both dishes were advertised to contain nuts - specifically pecans, none were detected in either.

Not one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed.  Best new restaurant?  Um - sure - for corn and tripe."}
{"text":"Meh, its OK.  The wait was OK, the bar staff was SLOW and they practically ignore you. The food is meh - not much more to say.  I am confident they will be better over time though."}
{"text":"Drinks are WAY over priced!!! Bartenders were nice. Shots are too much. You can buy bottle for the price of a shot.  Don Julio shot is $40, in Cali you can get a Don Julio shot for Under $10."}
{"text":"I live in California and I have strict expectations about tacos. Barrio Queen failed to meet those expectations.

First, we were handed drink menus once we were seated. We were then told by our server that they no longer offered anything on the drink menus. Why the tease?

Their taco menu, though extensive, was overwhelming and superfluous. Our table tried some of the more exotic tacos such as the cactus and some mushroom thing. Both were next to inedible. The mushroom taco in particular was one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. The chorizo taco was good, but not $2.75-for-two-bites-good. We tried some of the other menu items and the inadequacy in flavor was only compounded by their egregious pricing.

I would not consider coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone. Go to a real taqueria instead."}
{"text":"I was so upset coming here. ): The food was good however the customer service was very bad. I had a party of six and was told the wait would be 5-10minutes as it was not very busy. 30 minutes later I asked the hostess if they knew how much longer it would be. Turns out whoever I spoke with did not even put my name down. After I told the hostess my name again I was called with in the next 3 minutes. As we sat down and ordered water and soda our drinks took over 10 minutes to come out and it stunk because it was not even that busy. Usually I would say something probably happened in the back of the restaurant, but no. The waitress had been chatting with the hostesses and other staff members. Our order was finally taken and two orders were messed up. We didn't want to bother getting them remade because who knew how long it would have taken for the waitress to come back. Once we got our plates 30 minutes or so later the waitress comes back and gives us our check. We were not asked for any refills, were not checked on, or asked if we wanted desserts. We asked the waitress to order 3 desserts and she just wrote down what we wanted and left. She had attitude and just did not seem enthusiastic about her job. I know we all have bad days but this was just horrible we are not rude customers we just wanted to simply celebrate an anniversary. I do not suggest this location. I could not imagine how they are on a busy night."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Barrio Queen I did not understand all the hype. The service was slow and they got my order wrong. However the second time they almost totally redeemed themselves. Food was great. They got our order right but our service was slow.  They switched servers on us midway through and I think there was some miscommunication."}
{"text":"Heard about this place when I vacationing here last month. We decided to come back for the Christmas holidThis place was AMAZING!!! I especially LOVED my margarita and pastor tacos!! They reminded me of tacos I get from my favorite Taquerio!!  Their chips and salsa were good too. I really felt at home listening to Chente and other classics!! I will definitely be coming back before I leave !! 

So this is our second time at this location and despite being closer to their Scottsdale location we decided to come here because the atmosphere and service was BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL!!! To our surprise our server we had last time Victoria was up at the front and remembered us and welcomed us back!! Thankfully the hostess sat us in her section!! She remembered  we were visiting from outta town and knew we were on our way back home ( WHAT AN AMAZING MEMORY!!!)  we started off by ordering he table-side  guacamole (which I HIGHLY recommend ) and house margaritas. BIG PROPS to the bartender because they know how to make a drink, both times we came our drinks were on point!! . My husband and I both got 3 tacos pastor, my daughter got the corn cocktail along with a cup of abondinga soup and my son went with the kids menu black bean n cheese burrito with fries and churros.  Everything was just as amazing as on our 1st visit, I only wish we had one of these places back home!! Victoria really made us feel like we were regulars and it really made our visit worth the trip!! Thank you Victoria for your ALWAYS  excellent customer service, our bartender ( so sad I forgot to ask their name) and the rest of the staff for making this our new go to place when we visit Az!! We will definitely tell everyone we know who lives here or is visiting that this is a stop they must make when coming to Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment! Staff don't seem to know what their menu offers and the temperature of my food was questionable. Found this place during the taste of Gilbert and was horribly disappointed on my return."}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere and the food is pretty good , but not always consistent.  Tableside guacamole is great . My main issue tho is Idon't understand the price of the drinks for the La Brava Margarita?  It comes in a VERY small glass with ice filled to the top & barely two sips for $10 ??? Several other drinks on the menu come with huge glasses. Fix the drink menu and might get 4 Stars !"}
{"text":"This is the \"La Chatita\" drink is great. Good food and great service. We were attend promptly and had awesome service."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican I've had in Phoenix since I moved here 13 years ago. I'm from Mexico and it's so nice to know I can go somewhere and know the mole will be good!"}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could. The food was good but the manager verbally abusing my family because I complained about a dog sitting in a seat eating from a  Barrio Queen plate. The manager didn't care and was apologizing to the dog's family. The hotness encouraged the dog to go on the chair and eat, was petting the dog then went and was touching cutlery.  The manager Jeff then proceeded to follow me and my family out to the parking lot cursing. Over terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is subpar. I have only had one good experience 1/3 times I've gone. 

The tacos are a must have!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, and a great bar. Victor, Heather, Dakota, and Luke are amazing behind the bar. I highly recommend stopping by for a beer, tequila, or margarita!"}
{"text":"Inventive and traditional street tacos are delicious. Great service - fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is not at all close to authentic Mexican food. I was highly disappointed when I ate here. The horchata was disappointing because I was expecting it to be real, when it's powdered horchata, I had a mouth full of powder mixture after taking one sip. And the guacamole is way over priced, $11 for guacamole that I can make myself at home for less. No thank you."}
{"text":"Good Guac made right at the table and tons of taco options. The signature tacos are great! Good service and lots of drinks too, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Looking for great Mexican food look no further!  They have a few barrios in town- this one is our favorite. They don't take reservations- we came in on a Thursday night at 8p and had to wait less than 15 minutes.

We started with the guacamole- we love when it's done table side! They even added in pomegranates- tasty!  The drinks were delicious especially if you like tequila!  I had the enchilada mole and it was great- my husband had Arizona burrito (burrito was good but spicy).

They have a nice patio if it's not too cold or hot out.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sat outside tonight, chilly night but no biggie with the heaters going. Service was prompt (it was clear the server had a large section, but she tried her best). Never got the servers name (pet peeve) but she did seem annoyed to have to do table-side guacamole... which I think is a nice thought, but should be done by someone other than the server, she rushed through it to get to her other tables, leaving the avocado and other ingredients \"diced\", but I fixed it after she ran off. The Barrio enchiladas were really good (the first ones on the menu), we had chicken and shrimp. Can't attest for alcoholic drinks tonight, but will be back. Cool vibe, will do well in desert ridge"}
{"text":"beautiful restaurant, horrible food. The menu descriptions sound wonderful, but unfortunately nothing is seasoned properly. From the tasteless salsa to the super bland cochinita pibil... everything tastes like nothing. What a shame."}
{"text":"Meh. Stay away from the queso app for sure. Cheesy is clumpy and greasy. Not dippable. The Guac is ok, BEWARE, they put pomegranate seeds or dried Cranberrys in it and it is weird and sweet. Also, I would say OVERPRICED! Check out Nando's on Val Vista and Baseline. WAY BETTER!!"}
{"text":"Great take on Mexican food. Atmosphere is current and authentic. Service is quick and courteous  Food is unique and very delicious. Started off with the queso fundido and shared 4 different tacos. Plenty of food and a great place to share with others."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio Queen in the past for a dinner with one of my girlfriends, & so I was excited to try the newest location, in Downtown Gilbert, on a girls day out with my niece. When we arrived, we were greeted by friendly hostesses who were courteous & seated us promptly. Our waitress didn't have a very pleasant disposition or attitude; in fact, she acted like it was an inconvenience to wait on us. This left a negative impression on me; & I'm usually one to see the best in others & find the silver lining, but I also believe in hospitality, good manners, & superior customer service. The food was delicious, & the branding for the business is genius & very unique & one of a kind, which I appreciated, as a self-proclaimed \"experience connoisseur.\" I like to seek out & find places that differentiate themselves & felt like Barrio Queen definitely nailed it in that area. The location is conveniently located in Downtown Gilbert, & an excellent place to take a date, a friend from out of town, or a family."}
{"text":"Bre's guacamole was the best. Her chicken dance is off the charts. Can't wait to come back. Also try the picante margarita, it was great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty up there. Huge bar and massive amount of seating. The vibe is pretty nice and lively. We were seated rather quickly on a Friday night. 

I had ordered a couple of tacos and friends had ordered some tacos as well and some drinks. It's a bit pricy overall. Our server was nice but nothing very memorable. A friend of mine had ordered a rather expensive drink and was uneventful to say the least. What made it expensive is that it is a drink that is made table-side for some fancy reason. However, due to a new bartender they had to stay behind the bar and make it there (keep in mind we were seated at a table). My friend was still charged the full price and our server did not budge on lowering the price. I personally felt it should have been advised prior to making the drink. 

The food is decent but not very authentic. It did come out pretty quickly though. In the end we ended up with a $100+ tab for 3 people. I personally would not go back unless it was for just a drink at the bar. I wouldn't suggest it however."}
{"text":"So a lot of the reviews mention 'new' location start up issues..... We got there early (grandma was with us) about 5 PM and took a table for 6 inside. We were seated immediately but told the patio was 45 min to an hour wait. So I can see the frustration there. 

Our waiter was not bad. After the first round of drinks, subsequent drinks showed up really quickly. 

And the food was REALLY GOOD for everyone. 5 of us got a verity of tacos with the 3 taco plate and I got the ARIZONA (green Chile marinated pork) Burrito, apparently a house specialty. It was exceptional. I would go back in a heartbeat, but I guess I would make it early!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and cool place. Our server Matt was great overall. Very friendly, fun and our table enjoyed his level of professionalism and friendliness. Matt's Hand made guacamole was fantastic. Several of us had the tacos, and theirs plenty of options of tacos. Definitely a must try. They must have like over a dozen choices of tacos alone. Overall very pleased with the ambience, service, and quality of food!"}
{"text":"This new location is even better than the one on 16th. Everything was delicious and more like gourmet Mexican food rather than you typical fare. The best thing is that it is mostly gluten free. Adrian our server was great."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited when I saw this was opening so close to our home. Our first visit we walked up and the place was probably half full, however they told us it was a 45 minute wait so we left. We went there again today for lunch- again the place was not busy but we had a 15 minute wait. The food was excellent, worth the wait however the service was poor. Our server forgot to bring out our appetizer. Once we received our meals we mentioned it to her... 10 minutes later she brought it to us. Any other restaurant would comp that because it was their mistake. She charged us for it. I was disappointed. The food was great, service poor and very pricey."}
{"text":"On our stay in Scottsdale we were recommended to go to Barrio Queen in Old Town.  It was excellent.  Waited about 45 minutes for a table, but that gave us time to walk around the town a bit and check it out.  They call you on your cell phone when your table is ready which is convenient.  The margarita were excellent, chips salsa and tableside guacamole excellent and entrees very good I especially enjoyed the Chiles en nogada, something I never would have ordered had it not been from a Yelp recommendation.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. I have never had anything like that and would definitely get it again.  Burritos were huge.  The place is big, seats a lot of people. Of course parking on the street.  I would go back again to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"We were in old town and couldn't decide what we wanted. Drove past here a million times before but never visited. Last night the patio looked lively and the smell of tacos drew us in! After being sat on the patio immediately we noticed shortly after, the patio began to fill up. It is a large restaurant so one would assume they would have a staff to match... WRONG! We were sat for 15 MINUETS before we were approached by our server. Our chips were stale, my sangria was WAY too sweet I couldn't even have more than 3 sips but the enchiladas I ordered were...ok. I probably won't be back. It really did seem like a cool place though... maybe just a bad night? Womp-womp!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Barrio Queen, since I've lived here, I've heard people gush over this place. My wife and I finally went and waited to be seated around an hour, which isn't a big deal if the food lives up to the hype, which it DID NOT. The service was poor and the food was average at best, I could have gone somewhere else and had better with 1/8 of the wait time."}
{"text":"First time at Barrio Queen was fantastic.  Everything from start to finish was delicious.  We arrived in time for happy hour and ordered the pork tinga stuffed poblano pepper, which is not on the regular menu.  The house Margaritas where excellent and well priced.  I definitely recommend the Chiles en Nogada, my date loved it.  I ordered the tacos and liked the variety of being able to mix and match.  We will definitely be coming back for a second round."}
{"text":"A solid choice for great tacos, if you pick the right taco. The house specialty tacos really preform and reach that 5-star level. But a few of the standard taco's are uninspiring. 

I was very pleased with the drinks and starters.

 The service could use a little work, as I saw more than a few parties neglected. The seating near the entry way, where I dined, was a bit tight. 

But overall, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen was fantastic in many ways.  First, our server, Marcus was one of the most attentive servers we've ever had.  He was pleasant and friendly, he checked on us regularly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, and he even gave us a 10% military discount when he noticed my husband was paying with a military credit card. The chips and salsa were a standout and the street tacos were all good. The beef and pork tacos were especially tasty.  The food we ordered was only slightly hot so we ordered some grilled jalapenos to spice it up a bit.  We were also impressed with the cleanliness of the entire restaurant, including the bathrooms.  If you are in Old Town Scottsdale, consider Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Being a Barrio Cafe lover, I was excited to see this sister restaurant opening closer to home. I figured we would wait a few months for the newness and hype to wear off before trying it. I will say, it was still packed with a wait.. and we showed up close to 5pm on a Wednesday which is still pretty early! I felt a little bad for the hostesses, they had a never ending line of people asking where they were in line, wanting to get added to the list, or needing to be seated. Props to them. 

Once inside I immediately liked the decor and overall vibe of the place. Definitely a little more modern and hip than the cafe which is more old school (but still awesome). Very open and a combination of indoor and outdoor seating. 

Our waiter greeted us after a minute with chips and salsa, and took our drink order. The chips are pretty thick, but I liked the salsa. I thought it had a little kick to it but still played it safe staying in a more mild zone. 

Our waiter was very nice and when it came time to order, he handled a few substitutions with ease and no judgement. 

The menu has a good assortment, but definitely what seems to take up the most space are the tacos. I took this as a sign and ordered the Mar Y Tierra tacos, which were three tacos on blue corn tortillas with shrimp and carne asada, topped with some pickled onions, avocado crema and queso fresco. They were so so so so so so so SO GOOD. I expected a great meal since I've had good experiences at barrio cafe, and this did not disappoint. I also ordered a side of refried black beans which were good. 

My companion ordered the Suizas Enchiladas with no sauce or chorizo on top, and swapped out her side of beans for a side of rice. The enchiladas consisted of pulled chicken and cheese, and she said they were excellent. When her order arrived, she still had a side of beans, but once we alerted our waiter he was quick to bring out the rice and so nice about it. 

The only downside was it taking awhile to get our check after we had finished. It was definitely super crazy by that time (close to 7pm) and everyone working was clearly running around to keep up with their tables/duties. I totally understand the chaos of a crowded restaurant and don't hold that against any server, but it still felt like it had a bit of that new restaurant vibe to it, still some small kinks to figure out. 

Either way, it was a very enjoyable meal and we will certainly be back. After a few visits, this could easily be bumped up to five stars - the food is already there."}
{"text":"This place is a gem at Desert Ridge!  Food is outstanding and very authentic, bursting with flavor!  Love the atmosphere and decor, and I found the staff to be friendly and accommodating.  I highly recommend the street taco plate, you can choose three different kinds out of a list of probably twenty!  The chips and salsa are also excellent!  So happy to have authentic Mexican cuisine in my area."}
{"text":"Group of 6 went for Sunday night dinner. The place has a pretty cool, modern ambiance.
The menu looked tasty, but no one had any alcohol due to the night before. Iced teas and waters for everyone!

Then...Mike the Server happened to us. I had to ask for chips and salsa because apparently you have to ask for that first they don't bring it to you automatically. That was unappealing. He stacked too many salsa bowls on the serving platter and spilled salsa over my friend. It was on the table and floor as well. They were cleaning it up and salsa buddy went to go get cleaned up. Mike the Server (MTS) then walked to the other side of the booth and spilled a bowl of the chips next to me on the table and floor. MTS was having a rough night. He communicated it was his 3rd day. Shocker. 

I ordered the pozole and chile relleno. The pozole was way better than my entree. It was green salsa based and was very tasty. I shared it and had leftovers to take with me. The stuffing was better with the chile and was not breaded like other chile rellenos I have had. Not sure if I liked this version as much. Everyone else ordered enchiladas and my guy ordered the brisket. That brisket was very tasty with the pickled onions. Everyone had leftovers to take home as we filled ourselves with tasty chips and salsa. The manager came by and wasn't very apologetic like MTS. She made little snarky jokes to try to be funny but I wasn't that amused. MTS gave the table flan on him since, you know, he spilled everything on us and made the evening rocky. The flan was very dense and had a nice sauce with is. I had one bite and that was enough. My buddy did in fact earn it since it looked like he got shot.

Would I go again? Probably not. There are so many better restaurants in Downtown Gilbert with not only better food but better service. I understand it's a new place but I've already made up my mind. My advice: don't wear white to Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"So good! Love their taco Tuesday! Only $2.50 a taco and I haven't had one taco there I don't like yet. Also save room for dessert their bread pudding thingy is to die for and the table side french press coffee is so good!"}
{"text":"Superb from start to finish. Great service by Robert who also did our tableside guacamole...which was delicious but $ 10.75 ouch!!! The restaurant had taken my favourite item off the menu (Pollo Coco) however one of the chefs remembered it and was able to make it again much to my delight. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant, the service swift and overall a great pleasant evening...!!!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service.  Good chips that are home made.  I ordered the pollo con mole y pablano.  It was a great dish.  Their house wine is great (unusual for mexican restaurant)."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying this place! The outside seating area looked cute and the smells when you walked by were divine. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to our expectations. 

Once we were seated, our waiter came and took our drink and food orders and said he would be back with waters. (In the 95 degree heat, we really were looking forward to that cold water!) About 15 minutes had past and we still had no drinks. Another server stopped by and asked if we had been taken care of. I told her yes but asked if she could bring us some water and check on the drinks. She came back quickly with water and said that our drinks would be up shortly. About 5 min later, she brought us our drinks from the bar. 2 minutes later, another waiter came and brought them again but took them back when he realized we already had them. Uhhh confusion much? No one stopped at our table again except to bring our food, which was like so-so. Nothing special. Our waiter passed the table about 5 times and not once asked \"how is your meal?\" or \"can I get you anything else?\". When we were handed the check (not by him), he stopped by to say sorry for the mix up with our food and drinks. Uhhh if he was hoping to regain the loss in a tip, that was too far gone. The other thing that reallllly bothered me was the fact that the hostess literally was watching our table the ENTIRE time we were there. She walked around and passed our table once every 2 minutes, at least. Non stop. And was taking notes on an iPad as she would glance over at us. It felt like they were waiting for us to go so they could seat someone else. It was awful and made us feel rushed. 

Terrible service, awful hostesses and the food was eh...with so many other options, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is decent. The menu is too big. It's pretty expensive for how good it is. They make you pay for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for quite a while and love it every time.  We always order street tacos.  The variety and combinations of street tacos are to die for.  One day maybe we will branch out, but these tacos are hard to pass up.  Make sure to order the quest as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Barrio is known for overpriced food and drinks. I have used to go to the original Barrio location a lot and watch the prices rise big time over the years. $11 for a dessert. The Barrio Queen has the same concept. Overpriced f&b. Don't get me wrong, I know that the food quality is good, but there are a lot of better and comparable restaurants available that's a lot easier on the wallet."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, but unfortunately it's a full menu- would have liked a lunch or a la carte menu. Reasonably priced. I got one of the popular items, the \"Queen Barrio\", and it was just OK.

This place is overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"I dined at Barrio Queen for Mexican cuisine with friends for the first time and will not be returning. Here are a few reasons why: 

Chips and salsa - chips were thick and prefer them thinner and crispier with a hint of salt

The guacamole they make table side was very bland, consisted of chopped avocado and a little bit of salsa fresca. 

I ordered Grilled fish tacos. I received shrimp tacos instead as my server didn't hear what I said. It was pretty noisy where we were sitting. I sent them back and received shrimp tacos again. As they say, third time is  a charm. The server said he made them himself and they were in fact this time grilled fish tacos. They were just  OK but mostly cabbage filling and little fish. 

Most restaurants will have a manager come by if there's ever a plate returned to the kitchen. In this case, my meal was returned twice and management didn't know or didn't care.

There's too many good restaurants for this kind of experience."}
{"text":"It's good.... Limited vegetarian options but some dishes otherwise."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service was slooooow. Misters made it cool outside for a summer night in AZ but ppl were gettin soaked. The décor and ambiance was cool thoh"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were great as were the drinks.  I am not a fan of the tacos as they are have some unique and otherwise odd ingredients.  They seemed fresh; however, I just was not a fan of the flavors and ingredients used.  The service was fantastic and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Nope. Just nope. I get I had a big party on New Year's Day, 8 people. We decided to come grab lunch after my wedding and had very high hopes. The place was empty but we waited a good 35 mins for a table. It took over a half hour to get basic service, and even longer for them to take our orders. 

The food: the chips were beyond greasy and so thick. Not very edible. Luckily we never needed a refill otherwise it would have taken another hour. The food took a good hour or so to come out and it was absolutely terrible. I don't get how this place is open still. The orders were wrong, the food was cold, and they brought out half of our parties orders but left the rest of us hanging for awhile. I was pretty close to walking out. 

I can get good food in a crowded restaurant taking time, but with a near empty restaurant and the terrible food, I don't get it. 

There are way too many restaurants in downtown Gilbert to go to, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I've never walked out of a restaurant in my life...until I visited Barrio Queen. Saw the decent reviews on Yelp and thought I would ignore the strongly negative ones.

...I was wrong. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. When we were seated, the table was not set. We poured over the menu and made some decisions, only to realize that no one had come by our table, whereas it seemed like the other tables were being served. We waited about 10-15 minutes, before another waiter came over and saw us and asked if we had been helped yet. He said he wasn't our server but he would find out what was going on and if he could get us some drinks. About 5-10 minutes later, someone came back with our chips and salsa and water. He never introduced himself as our server and just walked away, so we assumed that he was just someone helping out. 

We waited another 5-10 minutes and no one came back.  Finally, I decided that I had had enough and got up and walked to the hostess stand to ask what was going on. They said they were short on servers. We said that we hadn't been helped and just would have liked to have an explanation as to what was going on instead of just being left to sit there. They could have even told us when we were seated. The person who apparently was our server came running in saying that he just delivered us our drinks and saying that everything was fine. They didn't try to fix anything besides offering us free nachos multiple times...so we decided to leave and had a great dinner at another nearby establishment where we were served right away."}
{"text":"One star for at least being fresh, and the second star because the servers are usually great. I never rate a place negatively that I haven't tried at least a few times. You're really paying for ambiance here, if I'm being honest. The meat has been over cooked (like super dry) every single time I've tried a new dish. This week I used doordash despite my previous experiences, because I was working and starving and just wanted some soup. I ordered a bowl of albondigas and it was delivered and literally had TWO small meatballs and broth. Nothing else."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing!!!! Our bartender Laura provided fantastic service no drink was empty. We weren't fans of one of our appetizers and Kara took care of us! The atmosphere was so energetic and fun..... can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant half empty on a Tuesday night. Can't seat us right away - 'must text you in 10 minutes' -. We went next door to the competition who seated us immediately. Baby sitters are expensive and we don't have the time for games so we can buy drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"They have spicy margaritas and that's the only reason I've every gone, and unfortunately they are not included in the happy hour. They're tacos are pricey for the size. The salsa on the table is good, but the chips SUCK! There is also no hot sauce on the table. 

I've been here twice, but there are other places that are just better. I might be back for a spicy margarita some day, but I'm not rushing."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen was recommended to us on a recent girls trip to Scottsdale. We started out with margaritas and table side guacamole. The guacamole was so good, a little on the spicy side, but perfect! We each ordered a variety of tacos. They are slightly bigger than bite size so it's nice to get to try a little variety. Fillings were good, but I felt like the shells got really soggy fast. Cute and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wanted a fun happy hour with local color.  Welcome to Barrio Queen.  We sat at the bar and was warmly greeted by everyone.  The menu is online, expect typical pricing, but appreciate their generous pours.  The chips were fresh and salsa is mild.  I took pity on my friend and didn't request the habanero upgrade.  Takeout was our choice for dinner.  I was impressed with the bartenders' multitasking and laser focus to ensure every special request (extra dressing, etc) has been met.  The burritos are enormous!  The Barrio Pollo was exceptional, melt in your mouth heaven.  The chopped salad was also impressive!  This is a fun night out, great place to bring visitors, and is also in a beautiful area for an after dinner stroll!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent 5- stars. I've never had a bad meal. Love their tacos, especially the steak & egg taco, my personal fav! However I rarely have received good waiter service. Whether table or bar service, the wit is extremely long and the staff does not seem to have a sense of urgency to greet customers, take orders, refill water/ drinks, bring chips/salsa to tables. The staff is very friendly just too laid back in my opinion. This is an easy problem the owner can fix by stressing superb customer service to the staff."}
{"text":"We love coming here. If you ever want to have a plateful of incredible tacos then look no further. Their food and drink specials are to die for. Last time we visited one of the managers came by to say hi (Josh). He was extremely welcoming and encouraged us to try things that he thought we would like. Thanks for helping with our experience  the churros (as suggested by josh) were phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a margarita this bad since my only visit to Salty Senorita. Ordered 2 Palomas which call for fresh squeezed lime and grapefruit juice. When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit soda....What? Total sour belly result and $28 later a lesson learned. Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home."}
{"text":"Was very excited to see a Mexican food restaurant back at Desert Ridge, unfortunately, Barrio Queen missed the mark. We were there 10/27 at 4:45pm and waited 45 min for a table. Once seated, our server came by with waters and said he'd be back to take our drink order. 15 minutes he still had not come back so we ordered margaritas at the bar. Margaritas were the best thing about this place. The chips tasted stale. The grilled corn was under-cooked--not one kernel was charred. The mini tortas need to be served on a thicker roll, they came out soggy and mushy.The taco meats were flavorful, but impossible to eat because there was too much juice in the meats which also made them soggy. I would recommend asking for double tortillas so you can actually pick them up instead of eating with a knife and fork."}
{"text":"Poor poor service. Sassy server..got better as the night went on but not the best first impression. Food wasn't bad flavor wise. Very small tacos, Tortas had barely any meat.. Much better food in the area with attentive servers and fair food for price"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Mixes traditional Mexican dishes with new culinary styles. Best Mexican Food Ever. If in Scottsdale, come early and trying out. Service was also excellent. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives. Good atmosphere and the patio was nice. Tableside guacamole with cranberries was AMAZING. Tacos were tasty but very small. I especially liked the al pastor pork. 

The service is where things fell extremely short. We sat at our table and our waiter didn't show until about 7 min later. We ran out of water on 3 occasions and our server was nowhere to be found. I requested sour cream to come with my meal and it didn't make it.  Our  server didn't manage to check on us until after we finished our entire meal. What did show up was a charge for sour cream on our bill that I didn't notice until after we had already paid. 

This place has a lot of potential, but they really need to get things together with the service."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen has amazing tacos and drinks! Victor, the bartender, always knows just what to make and had the most welcoming personality. He's consistently the reason I kept coming back!"}
{"text":"I can tell you that the place is artsy, Fartsy. Aesthetically pleasing but the food was a total disappointment and the drinks were...eh, at best. The waiter(s) were super nice though, so bonus for that. The food was absolutely flavorless. I ordered the veggie tacos since it's one of the only vegan options but even the Mexican corn appetizer and beans were flavorless and according to the other guests I was with, their food was NOT worth the price. I wouldn't rush to try this place out unless you're into that gringo Mexican food, in which case this place is probably right up your alley!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Monday half priced margaritas. El Don was fantastic. Price was right.  And the crane a dada burrito was awesome best burrito I have ever had. No lie."}
{"text":"Elote(corn app.) is awesome here.  Ambience is colorful and fun."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for something halfway decent in our hood! We went here for lunch today and this place did not disappoint. The staff was on top of it. Although the waitress was a little slow, she was apologetic and the manager was wonderful and checked on us as well. They were very accommodating with my food allergy too. I really really hope this place keeps it up! Great ambiance and great food! Can't wait to get back there this weekend to try the margaritas!

So we went back last night. Complete disorganization. We waited 20 minutes for a drink at the bar (and there were at least 10 bartenders behind the bar) and then once we were seated it took 30 min to get drinks, another 30 to get an appetizer and then we waited 20 more min for a round of drinks. I told the waitress to forget the last round and bring our check but instead after 10 minutes, she brought us our drinks that we cancelled, THEN brought our check and charged us for the drinks! Total Shit-Show. I totally get that it was the first Friday but OMG they've got to get it together! Tons and tons of staff roaming around aimlessly and nothing getting done. Chips, salsa and appetizer were good so I'm leaving 3 stars. We will wait a couple of months to try it again and hopefully I can go back to a 5 Star review. Don't blow this Barrio Queen! Train your hostesses, bartenders, servers and managers!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos.  Great Moscow Mule.  My husband and I really enjoyed our time the other night at this restaurant.  They even texted us when our table was ready.  Our server Tara D. was on point, super friendly and helpful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Barrio Queen for lunch today.  I live in Chandler and was meeting a friend from Cave Creek so we wanted to meet somewhere in the middle.  I got a lot of recommendations to try this place and read the reviews on Yelp.  It sounded great!  Parking was easy... it was a Saturday afternoon but the underground garage had plenty of spaces and it's free.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to sit outside.  It is unseasonably warm right now and unfortunately our table had a lot of sun so it was kind of hot!  But, it was a nice patio and I liked the overall feel of the place.  Our server took our drink order and I think she brought me a Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke.  After she came back I told her I didn't think it was a Diet Coke so she brought me a new drink which was correct...however it took a while for her to come back with it.  The food was ok.  A little pricier than I would have liked for what you actually get but I guess that's Scottsdale.  I had the Carne Asada torta that came with fries.  The fries were steak fry style (which I am not a fan of) and they had some kind of seasoning on them that I didn't care for.  The sandwich was actually very good but nothing I would go back for.  My friend had a salad -Aguacate Tomato Mango.  It was more like a plate of wedges of Avocado, Tomato, and mango...no lettuce or anything.  It looked good if you are into that but it wouldn't have been enough of a satisfying meal for me.  My bill with tip came to just under $20 and in my opinion, that was more than I thought it was worth.  It wasn't horrible and I would give it 2 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't let you...so \"Meh, I've experienced better\" would perfectly sum it up.  I think I would have given it a better review if we sat in the shaded part of the patio and if I had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 plate...the tacos are supposed to be good."}
{"text":"Waited to return to Scottsdale to eat this delicious food.  The service was better The food not as great as I remembered but still good . I wonder if this place got sold since I lived there a few years ago?"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! The sever even accommodated our family with a hotter salsa."}
{"text":"Couldn't get a seat. Not because it was full, but because they wanted to provide us with 'excellent customer service' once you're seated, so you get to wait in the wind and dust for 40 minutes while there are 10+ tables that are empty. That was some excellent customer service! If you won't hire enough people to serve a semi-full house, maybe the restaurant business is not for you. Also, it is probably a better idea to let your customers know that service might be delayed, and ask if they would like to be seated during their wait. Don't make up stupid excuses!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a great spot in Old Town if you're looking for some good tacos. We were able to watch the Suns game from a booth which was fantastic. 

We started off with the Barrio guacamole which is made table side...this seems to be the way to do guac these days and I'm not complaining because it was so good. They put pomegranate seeds in it which was surprising at first but I really liked the unusual addition! They also have really good chips, which can make or break a Mexican restaurant experience for me, pun intended. 

Next I did the three taco deal. I tried the Cochinita Pibil, Carne Asada, and Pescado tacos. I wish I spent more time eating them because I'm not proud to admit they were gone within minutes. Granted they are small street tacos, they are packed with flavor! 

Between the chips w/guac, an amber dos equis on draught, and three tacos, I was smitten (as my Zach would say). 

This is a place I'd love to head back to on a Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great Street Tacos!!   Best selection I've seen!!   This is a very comfortable restaurant both inside and out!!  One of our favorite places to eat after a trip to the Scottsdale Fashion Mall.  Their Sangria is awesome too!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was meh. I do hope they get their act together because Desert Ridge needs a tasty fun place to hang with friends - without a 50 minute wait for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious!!! We love Taco Tuesdays.... The drinks are yummy! The guacamole is the best!!! The atmosphere is always fun!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write. I liked Barrio Queen from the moment we walked in. The hostess was very pleasant. I asked to see a happy hour menu which she quickly produced. K & I checked it out & decided to stay. (We were contemplating going to Pomo, but the h.h. menu looked good.) We grabbed a couple seats at the bar and proceeded to order. K ordered the Queens Cooler $7 while I ordered the Casa Margarita $5. K said her drink was fine. My marg was gone in basically 4 sips. Not because it was so delicious but because it was only a few ounces of liquid on some ice. 5 bucks? Really. We also ordered some food. H.H. Tacos $3 and Carnitas Chile Verde $5. They also brought out some chips & salsa. The tacos. Happy hour price is $3 for two. Buck fifty each. Good price, good taco's. The Carnitas Chile Verde was fantastic. 5 bucks was a deal for such a delish dish. The salsa was also really good.
BUT, here's the deal-e-o. The 3 things we ate were yummy. And they were priced right. The 2 drinks we had were good, the Marg a bit skimpy, but I'm not sure they were even worth their H.H. price. The service from the 3 bartenders was o.k., nothing above &/or beyond. Then I looked at the menu. Are you fu!$@#& kidding me? You can eat better Mexican food in so many places for so much less. The menu starts out innocent enough. Appetizers $4 - $12. That works. Salads, soups & beverages are all priced o.k. Taco's done 21 different ways for $3.50 or 3 for $10. Our h.h. tacos were worth $1.50 each, but $3.50 each from the reg menu, No way! You can always come on \"Taco Tuesday\" and save yourself a buck, all Tacos for $2.50. Four types of Burritos $11 each. Enchiladas $10 - $15. Tortas $9 - $12. And then you see the small box that says \"Sonoran Dogs\" $8.50. OMG, the best and original Sonoran dogs are found in Tucson and they're under $3.  Who and why would anyone pay $8.50 for a Sonoran Dog. Lastly the Entrees. $13 - $24. My only comment here is $20 for Carnitas. Must be the most expensive Carnitas in town. I think this was the point we asked for the check and headed over to Tia Rosa.
As I stated at the beginning, I liked this place when we walked in. But walking out, not so much. And seeing all the t-shirts for sale on the way out reiterated that this place is about making money.
Good luck to Barrio Queen. Food and service 3 stars but the regular menu prices brings it down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour on Tuesday! Get a plate of three tacos, your choice of side and a drink. It's a lovely sit down meal without breaking the bank.  This place is my personal choice for tacos in downtown Gilbert. The flavor is definitely there. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can you get a seat on a Saturday afternoon?  sure 5 min wait, but why so little time?? well my first time here, wanted to go to Joe's BBQ but too hungry to wait in 30 min line so walked over to the Barrio Queen.  Chips and Salsa to start out, really like the chips they are thicker and very crispy, the salsa had a great taste but was too watery.  Ordered the table side Guacamole, too much lime juice !  we let him make it without the jalapeño and the pomegranate, but should have watched him with the 1/2 a large lime he juiced into it, just too much.  The chips were so good I ate the guacamole anyway.  Ordered a $15 dinner chile verde, VERY SALTY, and very small portion served with 3 - 3\" tortilla's and rice and black beans which were really tasty.
The waiter pretty much ignored us, had to ask the manager for an additional taco, which by the way was very sad 3\" chicken and green chile with a little sauce. Also had to flag down the waiter once again to refresh the drinks.  Although he turned on the personality when he brought the check, it was too little too late.  Bye Bye Barrio Queen, this one has been checked off the to do list."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  I ordered the Chile's de Nogada (I think that was the name) and my friend ordered the award winning dish (forgot the name).  I would say overall 4.5 stars but have 5 because the entree was amazing.  The reason I say 4.5 is I thought the chips were a little too hard but the salsa and guacamole (ordered that and it was amazing) and also the food was brought out a little too quickly (we had barely started our guacamole when the entree came).  I do love and appreciate food coming out quick but it would have been nice to have enjoyed our guacamole a little longer.  Overall though delicious and very impressed!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen's ambience is trendy yet still casual, just my kind of place. The food was unique but not all that impressive. We ordered the Barrio papas with shredded chicken ($6 hh price), pork tinga stuffed poblano peppers ($6 hh), and a chile verde pork plate that came with beans and rice ($15). We didn't particularly care for any of them. What we loved, however, was their horchata ($5). It was delicious and not overly cinnamonny. Overall, everything was just okay. But it's a fun place and the horchata was great. Maybe we'll try other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale, I found this place on yelp. I'm really glad we stopped in for an early dinner.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed some ice cold beers and apps.

They brought out some hot chips and salsa..

I can't remember the name of the slow roasted pork dish but it was great. It was beyond filling...

We will be back if we are in the area...."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. We were there for an hour and still didn't receive our entrees, a while later we received our food and it was soggy and hardly warm. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because despite the soggy-ness, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious  Mexican food. Table side guacamole with pomegranate. Yum!  I also had the brisket taco and the grilled fish taco. Both were so fresh and tasty, topped off with a jalapeño margarita. Great place!"}
{"text":"Host staff are rude and unfriendly. Food is good. Drinks are very good. Wait staff are above average. Tacos are very average and nothing special. There are a few great menu items including the chorizo burger. Def give the Barrio Paloma a try"}
{"text":"My parents have lived in Mesa for a long time now and the only times we would come to the Old Town Gilbert area was when my grandpa wanted breakfast from the Farmhouse. These days, this area has been blowing up with amazing new restaurants and I was excited to take my parents to Barrio Queen. We ordered pozole and their platter of cochinita pibil. I was not a fan of their chips and salsa, but the pozole was on point. My parents devoured the cochinita pibil platter. We had such a great time there and I was impressed of their tequila selection. 
I will definitely be taking my parents back here...especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today had a Barrio Pollo burrito. This was the BEST!! Burrito ever. Chicken, crema, sauce omg so much so good."}
{"text":"We waited a few months after it opened to come here. We could see that there was the usual huge crowd to go here soon after the opening so we wanted to let it settle down first. Came here on New Year's Day, I got the chilaquiles and my husband got the Azteca brisket burrito. I really liked what I got- it was better than the chilaquiles at snooze am. I tried my husbands burrito and it was ok, to me it was nothing special but he liked it. The waiter and hostess/ bus person were friendly. The chips they bring you are freshly made here and the salsa is good; I asked for more spicy salsa and the waiter brought it out. I would come here again because the menu is pretty big and there's a lot to try. I liked the way the place is decorated too. I took a star away because the chairs are too high and the tables too low. Made me feel like I had to sit up straight the whole time and couldn't relax."}
{"text":"This isn't Mexican food. Stay away. Salsa no flavor. If you have ever eaten Mexican food you would know that it is flavorful. Wait staff very unhappy and not friendly 
Spend your hard earned money somewhere else. 
Didn't talk to management because they would probably offer a free meal next time.  No thanks"}
{"text":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!!!!!  Did l mention the service is Terrible?  So is the food!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the food was excellent! Very reasonable pricing too! Our waitress WHITLEY was super sweet and fully catered to us! Her personality was very inviting and chipper. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The casa Margarita was vile. It's worse than pre made grocery store blend. Skip it.

The service here is horrible. We had 6 waiters walk by our table and none of them helped us.

I hope this place gets better. They haven't been open long maybe it will improve..."}
{"text":"Had a bad feeling about this location from the get go; Four girls standing at hostess stand, barely got a friendly smile, let alone a \"welcome\".  Place was not crowded at all but yet they were going to seat us in the corner by the bathrooms. I asked for another table and was told they were short on servers... as 3 servers were STANDING in  middle of the restaurant chatting!  Server we had, not attentive or friendly at all.  He really seemed put out with us.  Food is marginal at best for the price at this location.  Old Town location is 10x better.   Never going back... much better out there."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican hot chocolate with tequila!! That was the best part. Plus pet friendly patio and yummy drinks and guacamole. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for the taco Tuesday special, 2.50 per taco. I ordered 3, they are just small street tacos, but the chips and salsa that they give to you filled me up. I got three different ones and I will write about each one separately.  1. Carne Asada with Chile relleno- the meat was very tender and well marinated,  the \"Chile relleno\" was actually a jalepeno. This was a, dissapointment. The flavor of jalepeno over powered the flavor of the meat. I wouldn't get this again and hope they change it to an actual Chile relleno or at least use the correct Chile pepper. 
2. Conchita Pobil- this was good,  the marinated red onion was my favorite part.  I may get this again, I will say I have had better. All I'm going to say is LA SANTISIMA Taco shop in Glendale. 
3. Saudero Azteca (Brisket)- this one was my favorite, I wish I would have had two of these ones. Next time I will want a burrito with this meat. 
I will be going back to Barrio queen to try new items. Just a few suggestions; please have different salsas available with different heat levels. We all don't enjoy mild. And when we ask for something spicier please don't offend me and hand me a bottle of tapatio!!! When I go to an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant I expect much better for the salsa options. Please offer other beans. I don't know any kid who would want a black bean and cheese burrito. And last, I think it's crazyv to charge $5 for a horchata. I will have to taste it next time to see if it's worth that. Better be some damn good rice water"}
{"text":"Great location, good service and great food, free public parking garage or within walking distance to Hilton Garden Inn"}
{"text":"The food was really delightful, and Im so impressed with the price point. Especially because the rest of the restaurants in the old town area are even more expensive, and their food isn't as good. I got a chicken dish, and it was excellent. The guacamole was SO good. if you go, definitely get the guacamole!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after being told there would be over an hour wait for Culinary Dropout (sad face). We'd always been curious about this restaurant-apparently it had won some sort of \"Best of 2012\" award-Although I was a bit apprehensive that it only has 3 stars on Yelp. Everything's subjective I suppose.
 
We had to wait a bit here as well, although not nearly as long. I was super excited to see salsa dancers and a band performing in the outdoor dining area. We ended up being sat at the table right next to where the band was playing. I was a bit worried about that...I imagined having to shout my conversation or order to our server...thankfully the band wasn't obnoxiously loud.

Our server was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the red sangria and my boyfriend ordered the margarita. The sangria was very delicious, however the margarita was so-so. Not the best I've ever had, although I don't normally drink margaritas. 

We both ordered the tacos. I don't know what I ever expect to receive when I go to a nicer restaurant and order tacos. I looked at the menu and thought \"Wow, that's some really inexpensive tacos! What a deal! 3 should be good for a meal!\" I also thought the same thing when I went to Distrito (except they were pricier there). Well..the tacos we ordered were the tiny street tacos. Boo. And 3 was hardly enough for a meal! Ha. That's not a knock on them, it's my own ignorance for not ordering 6 as a meal, like the menu suggested. There just wasn't many fish or vegetarian items to choose from on the menu, which was surprising to me-I just didn't want to settle for a quesadilla! I ended up getting 3 different kinds of tacos: Salmon y Mango, Pescado, and the Nopalitos (just because I was curious to figure out what the heck cactus tastes like).  I can't quite recall what my boyfriend ordered..at least one was Carnitas. Our tacos came relatively quickly! I was really surprised considering how busy it was. They were really tasty. I enjoyed the Pescado one the most, however the cactus taco was quite an interesting experience. Not bad, just not my cup of tea. We also received salsa for our tacos, but both the green and red salsas were much too thin for my taste. Afterwards, we were still hungry so we ordered chips and salsa. The salsa that came with the chips was miles better! 

Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. The atmosphere with the decor and live music was very enjoyable and our server was extremely friendly. The food was decent. I would probably go back another time just because the service was quite good."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in premium Scottsdale location.  Food is super fresh, staff very attentive, and it is is a busy place on weekends!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!...margaritas. .and queen jalapeño cocktails were refreshing. .we got their signature entree conchinatos to share.  Sunshine felt great  also."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Camaron Asado taco and the Carne Asada, Chorizo Azul taco. The chips and salsa were delicious, as well as the table side guacamole. Great service, Richard was so awesome! We loved the music, and will definately be back again for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Super cute inside! Our tacos were delish- especially the Al Pastor & Carne Asada. Loved how they offer Sangria by the pitcher, which was yummy. But best of all, THE SALSA- So good and they give you a ton!"}
{"text":"I had the cochinita pibil and was a bit confused. Wasn't sure if it was pork or beef (birria). Light on the seasoning. 

Service was excellent, the food was a bit underwhelming."}
{"text":"Went in not knowing what to expect menu is very different from any other Mexican food restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. Food was great our waiter Nick was very polite and led my wife and I to the perfect choices. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was great,  wait was long, food was good. I had the Enchilada Carne Asada. It had too much sauce, too rich, and to spicy for me, wouldn't have it again. Liked the atmosphere, will have to try the place again sometime.  Wait might be due to the location, it is pretty new to Desert Ridge..."}
{"text":"Well first of all the guacamole was GREAT.....however when we walked in the hostess's had no smile and frankly were not interested.   When told (at 2:30pm) that there was a 25 minute wait to sit inside we opted for the bar with full service.  I will now be brief.
1. The \"bartender/server\" never once even looked at us.   Lucky the bus guy got us some water and I ordered guacamole....it was excellent.   The \"waiter\" still never looked at us.   About 15 minutes later I saw someone come by who happened to be a manager .....he was great and took the order. .......The the \"waiter/bartender\" still had not looked at us.....1/2 way through the meal I ran out of water.........I had to literally holler to get that idiot to get me some water.   

The food was good.....but will not go back due to such poor service...One of the weirdest experiences for service I have ever had....

I left no tip....and felt poorly for the bus person (I have NEVER done that before)....

Manager was terrific but don't need the aggravation.

ONE STAR"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot! Barrio Queen in one of the primo spots in Desert Ridge. Great Mexican food and great people. 

I came in alone today to sit at the bar and get some work done. I ended up talking to one of the Bartenders Hannah, who was absolutely amazing. I wasn't sure what to order, so she skillfully helped me navigate the menu and even talked me into trying a jalapeño margarita which was delicious (I had two). If you like spicy, this is a must. Overall Hannah's energy, and great personality coupled with her great recommendations made this experience a home run. 

Love that this is in my neighborhood. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The barrio pollo burrito was one of the best mexican meals I've had since I moved from central Phoenix to Gilbert.  The spicy pinon creme sauce really made the dish.  I thought the quac (made tableside) was just ok. It was good but a little bland for my tastes."}
{"text":"After coming here for the wonderful elite event, I finally made it back with a friend for happy hour. We got a couple drinks, a couple tacos, the green chili pork with chips, and the huitllacoche quesadilla. The tacos were tasty, but a little dry, and maybe not the most exciting tacos, but good. We were not fans of the quesadilla... not sure if that had to do with neither of us having had huitlacoche before, so I can't hold that against Barrio. The green chili pork made up for any other shortcomings.... this stuff was sooo delicious, savory, maybe slightly spicy, falling apart meat, cheese... it was great. It was even great the next day as leftover after sitting in my car for a couple hours... that's pretty impressive stuff. Prices at hh were reasonable. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on our way through Scottsdale. I heard the tacos were something not to miss.  I had 3 tacos (3 for $10) carne asada with chorizo and blue cheese, grilled shrimp taco and barrio pollo with chorizo taco. My favorite was the grilled shrimp taco and the second was the blue cheese taco. The blend of Chorizo and blue cheese was very good. We also ordered the guacamole that has cranberries and it was excellent. Our server was friendly and very attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decorations were on point. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Overall a good experience but I would like to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Friends took us here while visiting Gilbert. Kids had a Sonoran dog. We had tacos n a lil pricey n mediocre. My cochinita pibil bland and carne asada ok. Chips nice n thick n salsa tasty. Mechilada not so great. Wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"I brought clients here for a lunch on a Thursday and we had an amazing time! They were visiting from out of town so I wanted to show them a good AZ restaurant. They were blown away by Barrio Queen, everything was amazing. We were told about a 25 minute wait, but only ended up waiting for about 10 minutes. We were sat inside since it was so windy out that day. Our server came over right away, bringing water and chips & salsa. The chips and salsa here are top notch. The chips actually come out warm and the salsa has flavor but it isn't overwhelmingly spicy. My clients got margaritas and they were happy with them. One got a jalapeño margarita which was suggested by our server and it was really really good! We all got tacos of various kinds! My favs here are the grilled fish, grilled shrimp and the pastor. The best part of my visit.... the customer service from the manager Sherrie! I forgot to get a receipt and they were so nice and helpful with emailing me one for my expense report. Can't wait to come back and try more of their awesome food!!"}
{"text":"I am writing about the drinks because that's all we had. I have taken small groups of 5-7 here for drinks before going out. One reason... BACANORA. They are the only ones who have it. 
Margaritas are good and some are great. If you can get the Barrio punch if your not into standard Margaritas. Extensive list of tequilas. 

My two choices for tequila are Casa Noble añejo and Revolucion 100 proof.
Bartender was cool both times.

Update after we finally eat there.

Once again, BACANORA!!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say... very disappointed. Granted, we showed up right before happy hour with a party of 7, but we were prepared. 40-45 min wait, no problem. We got a spot at the bar, got quick service n a drink to hold us over. Table was ready before we knew it, and before wait time listed! But.... once we sat at the table... 10 min wait to be acknowledged, then .. I'll come back with waters n get you drink order. 10 min later , drink order.. watched drinks in wait window for another 10.. semi descent tacos. Very bland for most of our picks. Guacamole, waitress should've suggested 2 orders for a table of 7. We each got a spoon full. Again, very bland. No flavor anywhere! Awesome skinny margarita! I don't think it was our servers fault, I think they are under staffed. Bad management. Help your staff out!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Sat at the bar, service was pretty good. I had the 3 taco plate for $11.  The three tacos were shrimp, fish and veggie. The shrimp and fish were very similar with a decent baja sauce, not a ton of shrimp or fish, but a bunch of toppings.  I think I preferred the veggie, tasty shrooms."}
{"text":"Great day at Barrio Queen. The server was so so...have had better. Food was excellent as always."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  I expected the best Mexican food ever.  My item turned out to be a la carte, which is unusual.  The waitress gave me a dirty look when I mentioned I'm used to getting rice and beans with my burrito.

The parking is a pain if you go in at the light because you have to pass the restaurant, go up, and double back. It's a hassle.

The waitress left us for long periods of time with NO service.  And what always gets me is that waitresses EXPECT generous tips with crummy service. She all but ran to the table and to look at the receipt right away to check her tip.  When she saw she didn't get 20%... I was glared at.  A TIP IS EARNED.  

Poor Service. Higher than normal prices.  I'll pass!"}
{"text":"I rarely review on yelp but this place was on point! Quickly seated, food was here before we knew it and service was fantastic. The food is amazing! The salsa and fresh chips are great! Love the freshly made corn tortillas too. They don't fall apart at all. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, which I like but I love Barrio Queen. This place is amazing, if you are looking for a nice blend of creative dishes with a hint of authenticity, this place is it.  The place is very nice, great location, I suggest reservations if you are going on a weekend night as it gets busy.  They are very accommodating to large parties, the most we have had is 6 but I have seen larger parties of 10 or more.  Guacamole is great! Made at your table, with figs and pomegranate, a creative take on guacamole. I have the tacos, pollo tacos are awesome.  Perfectly marinated.  My husband prefers their menudo (only served on weekends) or shrimp tacos.  We ask for the same server every time, Miguel, he is AWESOME.  Very friendly and attentive wait staff, considering how busy the place gets but given reviews about service, we like to stick to who we know.  Miguel knows us on a first name basis and knows what foods we like, he makes it a point to make recommendations based on our likes and dislikes.  Which goes a long way in our book!  They have a new manager, which I had never met the prior manager but the new manager made it a point to introduce himself to every table and check on everyone.  We sit, enjoy a chelada and eat food, surrounded by friendly people, can't beat that! Again, you have to have an \"open\" pallet, it is not your run of the mill \"authentic\" Mexican food. It is an original interpretation of Mexican dishes.  I have seen some mentions about no salsa, there is salsa, homemade roasted chili salsa, it's good and I have had it served with my chips.  Also, the statements about no sides, such as beans or rice with your tacos, that is correct, there are no sides.  That has not bothered me, I can order 3 tacos and feel fed and full , but if your someone who needs to feed an empty pit, 3 street tacos are probably not going to do it for you.  I have taken my sister and her husband to dinner, my sister loved it, her husband had a torta and did not care for it but admitted it was a bit \"too creative\" for him.  If you want authentic, homemade, simple ingredients Mexican, I recommend Casa Reynoso in Tempe.
P.S. their (Barrio) margaritas are darn near perfect! They also serve Victoria on tap, which I don't see too often."}
{"text":"I actually began the review back in June and never completed it but I remember our experience here like it was yesterday. My fiancé had made a comment that she wanted to try the food here after she was disappointed at Lo-Lo's which is right next door so we made a point of it to come here on our next date night. Our food was really gross. I would take being underwhelmed by Lo-Lo's than upset and unsatisfied at Barrio Queen. There, I said it. Provided I'm not that into Mexican food because I'm from NY and Mexican food isn't as readily available as it is in AZ, I know what I like and what tastes good. All three of my tacos had a weird taste to them, almost like a sour/sad taste. That's right, my tacos were sad. If there was an option for flour tortillas, I didn't see it and it wasn't brought to my attention when I ordered so that already wasn't in my favor since I don't like corn tortillas that much. My fiancé's burrito was covered half in what I think was the red sauce, but it was disgusting and also, it was brown thus it was dubbed the \"poop sauce.\" I actually had to scrape it off of her burrito so that she could eat it because otherwise, it wasn't happening. It tasted bitter, almost burnt, and just ruined whatever good that burrito had going on inside. I was shocked that someone thought that sauce was a good idea. I honestly think my expectations for the food here (maybe based off the location and the décor) were too high. Neither me nor my fiancé are heavy drinkers but maybe if we had thrown a few back our food would have been better. Our waiter was polite and attentive but he was very insistent that the food was good. Like, instead of asking if our food was good, he was kind of just like, \"it's so good, isn't it?\" But no, sir, it isn't. It's actually gross. But we're not jerks (for the most part) so we just nodded and declined to-go boxes for our practically uneaten food and left. Never again but two stars for the actual restaurant and polite, attentive service."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly service! I loved coming here for a good, filling meal! 

I had the 1/2 chingones which was very very filling and a huge portion of food and the e-camarones that was pleasantly spicy! 

The location, atmosphere and general vibe is very energetic, and in a central location. 

Great for large groups to enjoy a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Main dishes are good but the rice was dry and the beans were bland. Expected more for the chef's reputation."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Came in early on Sunday morning and decided to sit at the bar.  The bar tender comes up and says 'what are we drinking today'?  Uh... I don't know, this is a new restaurant, may I see a drink menu? End up ordering the $11 Skinny Margarita and it comes to us in a 6oz glass with 5oz of ice. My husband and I look at each other and we asked the bartender if that is the only size margarita they have? She shows us other glass sizes, but unfortunately the one we ordered doesn't come in any of those sizes. So we say ok. Meanwhile our table-side guacamole order is being prepared in the kitchen while we were debating canceling and leaving b/c of the service/drink situation.  Also, all of the servers and bus boys were congregating next to us and it was very uncomfortable. Guacamole arrives and it's a bowl of avocado chunks and some pomegranates on top... that's not guacamole.
Finally told the bar tender we wanted to return it and get our check. 
So the manager comes over, Shirley I believe- introduces herself and says our guacamole is more on the 'chunky' side. I said ok, we are also disappointed with the lack of margarita in our glasses, as it's all ice and they weren't even filled to the top. She says 'we leave room for the salt.  If the price is a problem, perhaps you should check out our happy hour where they are $2 off.'
Excuse me? The price isn't the problem.  The lack of value is the problem.  
She offered to buy us a burrito, no thanks, can I buy your drinks, no, we just want to leave, can we have our check?
She charged me $23 for 2 oz of margarita.
Unbelievable.
Never will we go back to this restaurant and we have told all of our family and friends.
We left there headed to Sol Cocina at Scottsdale Quarter- service, food and drinks OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Cool place, bad food. The tacos were not impressive at all. The tortillas were cold and the food seemed to be pre-made earlier that day. Definitely not fresh. My stomach ache all night was a reminder to never go  back."}
{"text":"It was my second week after having relocated to Scottsdale; and my friends and I came to this place after we couldn't get reservations at Roku at the W. This ended up being our plan B and apparently, not a great one. My friend spoke very highly of the food here and I was rather excited, considering this was my first night out in the city. We started with a few margaritas which seemed pretty decent and certainly packed quite a punch. We ordered coctel de elotes to start off with and they were alright as well. Again, nothing to write home about. We moved on to the entrees and I decided to get pollo con chorizo and nopalitas tacos. My heart sank when I saw the size of the tacos! They are literally bite sized portions and unfortunately I was unaware that these were not substantial by any means. Flavors were mediocre at best and my chicken taco came without any chorizo... yet another disappointment. I have an obsessive need to order flan at Mexican restaurants and judging by the quality of the rest of the food, I should've known better. Against my better judgement, I ended up getting it anyway and that turned out to be the worst part of the meal. Non existent caramel sauce and the pudding was tough as leather.. what a terrible let down. I had had a couple of pretty strong margaritas by this time, which certainly helped deal with the disappointment. Would I consider returning? Meh.. maybe as plan C."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food was terrible. I had to send my food back twice! The service was great, but I can make better food than that and I don't even cook much. I'll never be back. Very disappointing. Tried to get in touch with the manager and the email address is incorrect. So.....I am really never going back...."}
{"text":"The Queen was unbelievably flavorful. We ordered a bunch of their Tacos and each was its own special flavor.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"As a big fan of Barrio Cafe and Chef Silvana I was really excited to finally try Barrio Queen recently on a Saturday night. We had to wait for a table but it was well worth it. 

The guacamole is really the best in the area as far as I am concerned. 

The house margarita was very good, made with fresh juices not bottled. If you are into Tequila the Queen does not disappoint, there is a large selection of fine spirits to taste. 

The taco menu is the most interested assortment of tacos that you will find in any upscale Mexican restaurant in the country. Go ahead and try to beat this selection, WOW. Seriously? As a Chef I am thrilled to be able to get tacos here that are better than what I can make for myself. What a fun place. 

The Conchinita Pibil is made in the traditional Yucatan style and is melt in your mouth delicious. 

The Huevo con Chorizo made with Longanisa is outstanding and the egg was perfect as well as a nice surprise. 

My friend loves the Salmon y Mango which is Smoked Salmon with diced Mango and Pico de Gallo 

The Carne Asada and Chile Relleno Taco is a revelation. Wow. 

We had the Tres Leches cake for desert with really good coffee. There are many other dishes that I want to try so I need to go back like, once a week. 

Love this place. The outdoor patio was very nice, the evening weather was warm and there was live music. Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  Great margaritas, great food, great atmosphere.

Drinks:  We had regular margaritas and the blueberry margaritas, quite tasty.

Appetizers: We had chips and guacamole (excellent! they add cranberries to it and its amazing).  We also had the nachos which were to die for!  Very cheesy and flavorful.

Entree's:  We had several street taco's, the chop salad, the enchiladas suiza.  We had six different taco's, the best was the Conchita Pibil.  We also had the Carne Asada y huevo which was great, Cameron asado which was ok.  We also had the barrio pollo which was excellent, the pollo deshbrado which was good, and the Saudero Ateca which was also good.

Dessert: We had the churro and buenelos.  Churro was to die for with the carmel and pecans and ice cream!

We went on a Sunday night, it was busy, we were seated quickly, sat in the bar, service was decent, could have been a little more attentive.  I would eat here over and over.  Recommend a reservation!"}
{"text":"BQ is highly recommended by locals.  We found it to be excessively loud and the tables are too close together.  You literally sit 'shoulder-to-shoulder' to patrons at the next table.  The food was ok but not exceptional.  Service was just average.  We will not recommend or return."}
{"text":"We waited for about an hour for a table.  The four of us scored a comfortable waiting place in the outdoor lounge.  After waiting a while for beverage service I went to the bar and was served fairly quickly.  When seated and served chips and salsa I found the salsa bland and uninteresting.  My main course was a shrimp dish with some boring rice.  The 8 shrimp were a good size and had little to no seasoning.  Taco Tuesday is the way to go here."}
{"text":"Thanks to Chow Bella, my friend Lori saw that this place was opening Monday and we decided to go that night to check it out.
We planned on being there by 6, and I was a bit worried. Old Town. Day off for many. New place by Chef Esparza. Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time, as the place started to get pretty busy.
Looking at the menu was a little overwhelming, as there are dozens of different tacos to choose from. Yes, there are other things on the menu, but the tacos are the selling points because of the variety. I brought the menu home with me just to write this review, because we sampled so much ! (It's ok, it's also a take-out place and you can take the menu. I am not a crook. HAHAHA!)
We started with the elote, which you can get in a cup. It was delicious! We polished it off and ended up ordering another one later in the meal.
The tacos we had? The flank steak with an egg (of course), barrio pollo y chorizo, carnitas, cochinita pibil, camaron, and camaron con coco. We also had the green chile tamale. Everything was tasty and wiped out in seconds!
Here's where the final star for the review got taken away: Service. It started out great, but after the first half hour, it seemed as if we were forgotten. It was getting pretty busy, but with a chef who has so much experience, and a grand opening, the staff should have been better prepared. We had also ordered some things to go, and it took 45 minutes to get that. Luckily, the manger was really apologetic (and super cute!) so we didn't feel like total losers.
It also would have been nice for Silvana to thank the people who came out. We saw her a few times showing people her other new place next door and even congratulated her, but we basically got a nod and that was it."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, menu is very adapt to Mexican culture. Restaurant looks very Beautiful"}
{"text":"I ate at sister restaurant Barrio Cafe a couple years ago and was very impressed with the food.  We went to Barrio Queen today and was very disappointed.  For starters the chips were very thick, and some were chewy as they were not cooked through.  I miss the bread and olive relish served at the cafe.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas, very little chicken, mostly cheese with a good but not great mole sauce.  My kids had black bean burros with rice, the burros were ok but the rice tasted like it was out of a box, no flavor and seemed like an after thought.  Wife had fish and shrimp tacos which she said were flavorful but too small to pick up without falling apart. The service was good but did not make up for the poor cuisine. In my opinion there are way too many excellent choices in this town for mexican food, I sadly will not be going back to Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"We really want this place to succeed.  It's difficult to know from where the problems stem.  All the employees with whom we interacted were very nice but I believe they are not at the professional level.  We eat out A LOT and have both worked in the industry.  There is something wrong when it takes such a long time to get ones drinks and food.  The beverage server was extremely unaware of what was available other than they had tequila. Then our 3 drinks came one at a time in 10 minute intervals.  
Our food server, Julio, was very welcoming but our food was lukewarm at best and Julio did not reappear until we were almost done.  I had ordered a glass of wine but that did not appear until we were ready for the check.  
I'm thinking that it is either management or ownership that is keeping this restaurant from being a terrific choice. However, they probably think that as long as it's super busy, they are a success. 
That will not last..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner, a few weeks ago.Our sever Aaron was just amazing  very tentative and so polite. Being our first time there we where not sure what to order. Aaron took the time to give us some suggestions, much appreciated.  Great food, excellent service!"}
{"text":"This was our second attempt to try this place out.  We came a few weeks ago on a Friday night and it was over a two hour wait.  Today, completely different story. We walked in and were seated right away. We got here around one.  As we walked up to the restaurant there were a bunch of people waiting outside and I was afraid it was for Barrio Queen. But turns out it was for LoLos Chicken and Waffles.  

First impressions I love the decor.  You'll see the pictures from others.  Bright and lively. Indicative of Mexico.  What I didn't love was the dead fly behind my husbands head in the window sill.  Small details.  

I forgot today was Dia de Los Muertos. All the girls had face paint on. They all looked good but face paint creeps me out.  Our waitress was very quiet. Not very engaging.   My husband ordered a Bloody Mary and asked for it to not be too spicy.  Well that was a miss.  He couldn't drink it.  For me it was fine but not to his liking.  

We got the chips and salsa.  Personally we liked the chips. They were thicker chips and unsalted.  Thank goodness because you'll find out in a minute why.  The salsa had good flavor to it.  

I decided to order the \"world renowned\" table side guacamole.  Don't let the price scare you.  At $10.75 I didn't know what to expect.  Now for $10.75 you would expect some interaction from the server.  I guess expectation goes hand in hand with assumption.  We had non.  So we were asked if we wanted everything in it.  We didn't know what that was so we asked.  Avocado, onion, jalapeño, cilantro, tomato.  Is what we were told. They didn't mention salt and pomegranate.  Remember I said the chips were unsalted?  Well the salt  put in the guac made up for the no salt chips. Two teaspoons of salt in the guac. My hands were so swollen after but the flavor of the guac was really good.  

My husband ordered the pulled chicken tacos.  You get 3 tacos for $10.00. No rice and beans.  Sides are $3.00 each. No refried beans here. Black beans.   My husband picked one taco up and it fell apart after the first bite. That was it for him.  He got turned off after that.  He finished his meal but these weren't tacos that you could just pick up and eat. You had to strategically handle them with care.  The other thing he said was that they were too small.  

I ordered the chicaquiles with red chili.  Flavor was great but there was no chili.  It was more like enchilada sauce.   Can't really elaborate too much more here.  I ordered my eggs over medium and those were cooked perfectly.   I'm glad I ordered the guac because I wasn't into eating the chips covered in enchilada sauce. This was really disappointing because I was really looking forward to eating chili.  

I guess this place is banking on the colorful ambiance and plates to overturn the misses happening on the plates.  This is not a place for those with a faint palate.  The menu is more for those who don't mind adventure.  

Our bill came to $48.00. I have never paid that for a lunch. The only thing that really saved the day was the fact that my husband was able to watch the Cardinal game while we we there.    Would I go back again?  For the table side guac and colorful atmosphere?  Yes. But not because the meal will draw me back."}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd visit, but the this place was on pt tonight!!!!  The chips and salsa is prob my fav, salsa has enough kick and the chips are fresh and greasy enough for me to salt.  Just right. We have tried most of the special margs and Mexican drinks and almost all did not disappoint.. the mangoneda was delicious..  

As for the tacos,  since we normally go to joyride down the road(the line was huge this night which is what sent us to Barrio),  they were much more \"authentic\" Mexican style.  Which I appreciated.  I think I have a new fave for down town Gilbert Mexican food"}
{"text":"First time trying it with my whole family and we loved it.  Everything we ordered was delicious. Everything was fresh and what sets them apart from any other Mexican restaurant is that they use authentic ingredients. You can taste the difference. The tortillas for the enchiladas, the cheeses, the sauces, the spices. We had a perfect table with delicious food and what made it an even better night was the service. Our waiter, Carlos, was amazing, attentive and friendly. He made the experience very enjoyable. I've said it before, the service you provide can either make or break a company's success no matter how great the food is. Barrio Queen, however, is a triple threat with the food, atmosphere and service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at Desert Ridge location...4/18. 830ish PM. Nice restaurant setting.. inside and outside. Cute decor and atmosphere.  We were seated immediately at a large comfortable booth that was right in front of kitchen. Our server was polite and attentive.  Food was good.
Downfall was being close to kitchen and witnessing the food servers. One in particular was a young woman that seemed to be the expediter. She wore a cap with two braided ponytails. In between grabbing plates of food..she would play with her braids while talking to other workers. Not something you wanna see at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I am still torn on this place.  They have some great food but they also have a few items that are not that great.  

I'd suggest not going in on the guac at the table thing that people rave about.  I thought it was below average.  Also, they have a full list of street tacos that are overpriced and not great.

The good news?  Carne Asada is fantastic and the burrito plates are pretty steady."}
{"text":"Ate at this location for the first time, and we were very satisfied with our food and service.  We have been to their Phoenix location a couple of times and wanted to try this location.  I think the food is just as delicious as Phoenix, but I personally like this location better because I feel like it is more casual than the Phoenix location, plus they have a kids menu where as Phoenix they did not."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had sub par experiences both times. The staff is never really friendly and treats their job like something they just have to do. This last time topped it off, though...

I ordered the burger, but when I received it, it was literally a way over-cooked patty, a bun, and the thinnest layer of cheese I've ever seen. Nothing else on the burger as described on the menu. It was, hands down, one of the worst burgers I've ever had. I got about a quarter of the way through it before realizing how terrible it was (I was starving), but then our waitress disappeared. She finally came back after the rest of their table had finished their food. At this point, I was going to ask them to re-make it or order something else, so I just didn't eat.

Extremely disappointing, though 2-stars for the chips, table-side guac, and the decor/ambience."}
{"text":"Ordered take out - 3 Nopalitos tacos, side of veggies and churros.  Total came to ~$21 (Tuesday).  The desert menu is not on the website.

Took 25 minutes to prepare my order.  When I arrived it wasn't clear where to go to pick up my take out order, it is the bar.  But there is no designated spot.  I first had to stand in the area that was supposed to be kept clear for the wait staff, just to get the attention of the bartender.  He then passed me off to a colleague who printed my receipt, then walked around the counter to hand it to me to verify my order.  I also had to sign the receipt in the air, which was a balancing act.

The Nopalitos tacos were very plain and tiny.  The side veggies had too much liquid pooled at the bottom.  The ice cream had mostly melted by the time I got home, which is no fault of the restaurant, but it did taste off.  The churros were dry, slim and impossible to cut through with the plastic knife.  I liked the  filling.  The melted chocolate tasted funky.

Overall, I was disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"The service was quick we order the Cochinita tacos they were good but the tortillas were somewhat cold."}
{"text":"Good Mexican. Small portions but tasty   Expensive. Trying to decide if it's worth the money."}
{"text":"Service was HORRIBLE!  It took 20 minutes to get appetizers and drinks took almost as long.  I could understand it if it was busy but the restaurant was empty.  Were there not enough servers?? Actually no it seemed as if there were an abundance of staff around.  
We ordered off the sushi style taco menu.... we ordered a total of 9 different tacos.  Not only did we not get the right tacos, but our waitress couldn't even tell which ones were which.   As soon as she left a busser came over and asked if he could remove any plates....are you kidding me?  We just got our food.  In the end the chorizo overpowered many of the other flavors and the tacos were mediocre at best.  Definitely not worth the $3-4.00 each price tag for a three bite street taco, especially when you've waited almost 45 minutes for them.  
We also ordered a fondue appetizer which actually turned out to be a wad of overly stringy cheese with some sausage and mushrooms mixed in... totally impossible to eat and clearly not what you would expect a fondue to be.  
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE food and I especially love Mexican food, but for the price (and knowing the chef from barrio cafe) I expected much more.  I will NEVER go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this off shoot of the PHX Barrio.    Great tequila selection that was at first a lot to comprehend but my server Karen guided me through with ease.   Excellent selection of tacos from \"al pastor\" to \"salmon y arrachera\"  - my favorite.   Highly recommend and I'm a native - i've eaten a billion tacos.  Sit in Karen's section if you want to navigate all the highlights this place offers - she's awesome.   The location has been many things and I hope and believe this one 
will stick.   Cheers to you Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for dinner on a Sunday night at 9, first timers, restaurant closes at 10. The bartender was nice, and did a great job taking care of us, so she deserves most of the stars. 

I love the ambiance of the restaurant, the place has a great flow of indoor/outdoor with the garage doors, and cool lighting all over the place. 

The food is okay, but wonder if we came on the wrong night at the wrong time because I wasn't blown away with what we got. The pork posole and the chips and salsa were very good but the tacos my fiancé ordered were just meh. He got the original carne Asada, carnitas, and pork chile verde. He said the pork chile were decent, but the other two were so dry, no flavor, and mentioned the tortillas were so small and no flavor as well. For $10 for 3 small tacos which it looks like the place is known for, just didn't hit the mark.  

We were going to try the choco flan, but for $9 I was kind of worried what we were going to be served, so we just hit up DQ on the way home and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"The very best!!!! Our waiter's names was Angel and he made our whole night!!! The best service ever and he made our experience at barrio queen authentic!!! Please ask for him! He's the reason I will keep coming back to barrio queen!!!  Angel!!! You are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen at Desert Ridge has large dining room inside and mist cooled patio seatings. The atmosphere was very nice and comfy. 

Our hostess guided us to a table in the middle of the room but we asked her if we could get a booth which sat empty ten foot away. She glanced over and gave a frown and proceeded toward the booth. Not a good way to start our meal. 

However, our waiter (I think his name was Aaron) was super cool. He made our table side guacamole and very nice about accommodating our dislikes and likes in the ingredients he had at hand. He was super swamped serving several tables at once, but did a great job in taking care of us. 

Their chips and salsa was delicious and the table side guacamole was outstanding. It had pomegranate topping which made it unique. Their premium tacos were also outstanding. It had really yummy flavors without being salty. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Barrio Queen, you had me at guacamole made freshly before your eyes at your table side!

A friend and I stopped at Barrio Queen for dinner during a recent trip to Scottsdale as we were craving some Mexican food (when in Rome, right?). We happened to be in the very cute downtown area and walked by this spot with its cool artwork, and figured we may as well give it a shot! And boy am I glad we did. 

Right off the bat, service was excellent as we were seated quickly and our server was very personable, attentive, and ready to answer any questions that we had. For starters, we opted for some chips and guacamole and let's just say that decision set the tone for the evening. As previewed above, they make the guacamole fresh before your eyes on a rolling kitchen table type contraption. It was awesome! I love me some guac, and as you may have guessed, their home made version did not disappoint.

For my main course, I opted for three of the freshly prepared tacos that appear to be their calling card to some degree. Specifically, I went with one each of the barrio pollo, salmon con mango, and pescado. All came out wrapped lovingly in fresh, hand pressed corn tortillas. Though the tacos were a bit on the small side, they were all bursting with flavor and packed with fresh ingredients. I would definitely get the tacos again if I ever happen upon this spot, and perhaps be more adventurous and opt for some of the tacos featuring cactus. Before coming in here, I didn't even know cactus tacos were an option! 

Drinkwise, they offered a wide array of margaritas (apparently they have a Margarita Monday where margaritas are half off) along with your typical standard Mexican brews and a smattering of wines. 

If you find yourself in the downtown Scottsdale area, give Barrio Queen a try!"}
{"text":"I am so happy we decided to try this place out for my partners birthday! We have been searching for a Mexican Restaurant with an actual authentic Mexican \"sazón\"! This place definitely offers quality Mexican food that is sure to satisfy from the apps to entrees to desserts. The drinks are also delicious! Be sure to try a Michelada Chingona!! Especially refreshing during the hotter season. The plates alone are not very spicy but you can request chiles tatemados to help spice up your meal as well as extra salsa verde which is on point. This location offers a pleasing atmosphere. The waiters are amazing! Very friendly as well as maintain a great communication between different staff to make sure we received all requests quickly rather than having our main waiter take care of everything. We have very high expectations for food to taste like it does back home so my respects to this establishment as a whole!"}
{"text":"The drinks here are always good.  This time I tried the El Chapo and loved it. The happy hour menu is a bit limited, but the food was good.  I had the tortas which was basically two sliders for the happy hour price of $7.  I will have to try it again and get a full meal to get a better read on it, but I like the atmosphere, service and adult beverages so that is a good start."}
{"text":"Joyce W. loves bae.  \"Bae\" as in burritos and enchiladas!  Heyyy!

Came here for a night of hugs and heartfelt goodbyes.  My Meghan L. is leaving us cacti-huggers for the land of cheese curds!  :(  So how was Barrio Queen?  Minus the fact that you're paying Scottsdale prices for tortillas the size of a tennis ball [what even...] and $10.75 guacamole consisting of one avocado, the food is pretty good! 

I had the Chiles en Nogada which is a, \"Chicken breast, dried apricots, golden raisins, onions, garlic, and red wine in a roasted poblano pepper, served in almond cream sauce with pomegranate, queso fresco, and cilantro garnish.\"  It also came with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and calabacitas.  I can't recall any pomegranate seeds in my dish but it wasn't missed.  I was too busy eating bite after bite of the best stuffed poblano pepper ever.  And that cream sauce!  I could barely resist the temptation of picking up my plate and licking every last drop of sauce.  The chipotle mash was also very savory and creamy with a nice hint of chipotle flavor.  Calabacitas is a vegetable side dish so yummers!

I also tried Mr. W.'s Cochinita Pibil.  Slow-cooked banana leaf pork marinated in sour orange and achiote paste?  Count me in!  The tortillas were so small though.  It was smaller than my palm, about the size of a tennis ball.  They give like a huge mountain of meat but three of the tiniest tortillas ever.  Mr. Dubs ended up eating his entree with chips like a pseudo nacho thing.  

So while the ambiance and atmosphere in the restaurant is gorgeous [but man is dining al fresco craptacular when it's both hot AND humid] and the waiter is charismatic, I'm not sure I'll be back to this location.  I think their Gilbert location is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Barrio Queen is a \"nouvelle\" mex place, so if you are looking for real Arizona mex food this is not for you. It was different and the service fine but the portions teeny and the prices upscale. We laughed when our order of TWO tacos was delivered on a plate about 3\" in diameter at a spendy price. They were good but Aaron Sanchez I think would have giggled. French fries (wow fries not beans) were a little underdone with the chille relleno \"sandwich\") I ordered. It just had a big fat hot chili on top of it). Even the waiter said he didn't eat the chili and neither did most other people. Sorry we paid for it. Okay if you are not hungry and don't crave real az-mex!"}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour before going to an escape room in Scottsdale, and it's going to be on my list of go-to places for margaritas from now.  Margaritas (both the spicy kind and the house blend) were reasonably priced and had just the right amount of kick, complimentary chips and salsa paired perfectly, and the smashed-in-front-of-you guacamole was delicious.  We also had an ear of elote (grilled Mexican corn) which melted in my mouth.

Can't wait to stop by and try the regular dinner items."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Been here before and great service and experience with a bunch of friends. This time on my own on new years eve. At least 5 tables around me empty and two guys asked me if I'd been served in the 15 minutes i sat and waited...i said no to both but neither stopped. Then one of the door greeters walked down the length of the  restuarant..put something in her mouth and walked straight past me. Sat with two closed menus. I went to ths reception after about 20 minutes and said i was leaving due to the service and explained to one of the three girls standing there she was even eating over the kitchen counter in the restuarant. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The pork (Cochata) and brisket (azteca) were both good, although the pork was a little too salty.  The salsa was good, the guacamole was made at the table, and the tortilla chips were made at the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences to date! Our server was beyond obnoxious, offensive, misogynistic and pretentious throughout our entire visit. 
So bad in fact that my friend and I decided to finish our appetizer & head somewhere else for dinner. 

Disappointed that I spent my day off trying to catch up with a friend at such a horrible place. We couldn't even catch up because of how distracted & appalled we were at every interaction with our server. I clearly won't be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was really good. There is no shortage of good Mexican food in Phoenix, and we love to support local businesses. We got to the restaurant, and we were quoted an hour wait, which we expected on a busy Saturday. It was chilly out, so after a few drinks on the patio we moved into the lobby. My husband went to the bar to order a drink. He came back after 10 minutes, and I had a sip and it was undrinkable. We took it back to the busy bar, and the bartender told us she was too busy to remake it. Luckily, a kind waitress was nearby, and she said she would get us a new drink. We finally got the go-ahead for our table, and the hostess took us outside. I let her know we didn't want to sit outside, and that was not an option given to us when we put our name on he waitlist. It was really chilly out. She said she would have to put our name back on the waitlist to sit inside. We waited, again, for an inside table. Our server was great and could tell he was a bit overwhelmed. We ordered guacamole, but did not receive utensils after asking a few times, so we got them ourself. Once dinner arrived it was delicious. I wish we had a better experience."}
{"text":"First Time here and put it in our favorites folder!  Had the Puerco Verde app which was a meal in itself, just like what we cook at home without the 12 hour wait!   Sonoran hotdog deluxe was great, quality hotdog and cooked right without being a mess!  Wife had the California Enchiladas and they were fantastic!  Service was excellent and patio was packed without being obnoxious and noisy!  If you haven't tried it yet, give it a go, we are happy we finally did!"}
{"text":"Barrios Queen is the best mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Look at thier diverse menu, a complete bar , and fantastic servers. On Friday evening, our server Jacob was over the top, offering two GREAT meals, asking if we needed more drinks and attentive to our needs. The Queen is the best."}
{"text":"Nice place good margaritas just very pricey for the quality and quantity of food should be really delicious for the price and it's mediocre"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Gilbert.  The nachos were delicious, so unique and flavorful.  Great bartender, friendly staff.  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Sat at bar because they are usually very busy and we are there.  Tacos amazing and authentic. But the best things no there that I had was the jalapeño Margherita's.  If you order one.  Your first one a recommend a glass of water too.  After that they are addictive. Staff excellent."}
{"text":"We received a $100 gift card for this establishment. (Our family of five is well acquainted with Mexican restaurants.) In short: The service was slow, my son's chicken fingers were noticeably over cooked, my partner drank only a third of the poor tasting sangria he ordered, my steak was over cooked, it took forever to get a refill on my iced tea, and the tortilla for the enchilada that came with my plate was undercooked. The bill came to $107. There are at least three other restaurants in this city where I could get excellent Mexican food for the entire family for under $60. This restaurant serves middle of the road Mexican food with a poorly executing staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. The atmosphere was pretty cool. So much to look at. Our waitress was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. I tried the carne asada burrito.  It was huge. The meat needed a bit more flavor but otherwise it was pretty good. And my margarita with the cucumber and cilantro? YUMMY! I will definitely have to brings my friends back to check it out and try those cactus tacos!"}
{"text":"It's is Scottsdale great location but lack authenticity...ceviche was not that great and I ordered tacos that tasted like the tortilla was soaked in juice and fell apart.  They should do some research on how real tacos should be served. They have a lot of outside seating but not enough help as it looks like their service is spread this. Our server did a good job but it's obvious he had too many tables."}
{"text":"My only qualm with Barrio Queen is that I ate so much that I hurt...

From the table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds mixed in (try it) to the multitude of tacos and burritos, you really cannot go wrong. If you are looking for a suggestion, anything \"al pastor\" is my favorite kind of pork. This place really should be neighborhood royalty in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It took us over two hours to be seated, but even worse than that is we didn't get served in the bar area for about 45 minutes. The food is a watered down version of good Mexican food in the valley. Wouldn't recommend unless you don't know good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Between food poisoning and poor customer service, I had an absolutely horrible experience at Barrio Queen. My boyfriend and I decided to visit here for some drinks and food on New Year's Day. After 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar (where only one other person was sitting) we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order. My boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu, which was good, but not worth the 18 dollars we spent on it. That night my boyfriend woke up around 2 am violently ill, waking up every 5-15 minutes to run to the bathroom. I had only had a small bite of his food, and found myself feeling nauseous all night just from that. When I called the next day to inform them, the manager Lucas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was anything they could do. 
I don't typically spend a lot of money on food but we had spent 100 dollars between food and drinks that night. When the director of operations (I believe his name was Chev or Chef) called me the next day, all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he could do for us. He claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other claims so it wasn't something he could help with. He stated it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was \"up to standard.\" He seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a customer that got very ill from it. 
I've had food poisoning before and know what it looks like. Jolting up in the middle of the night to throw up, and then to be repeated every 5-15 minutes afterward until halfway through the next day, is not common for the flu or a bug as the director of operations tries to claim. 
After wasting 100 dollars this visit, and hundreds of dollars spent here before with larger groups, I will be sure that I never visit here again. 
The only pleasant people I would like to give credit to are the manager Lucas that I spoke with and our second bartender Ryan. They were both nice and good with customers."}
{"text":"First time we came here they forgot to place our order. So after the group next to us arrived, ordered, and ate,  we realized what had happened.  Manager appologized and gave us a $25 gift card.  So tonight we went back, long wait for our server to even show up, slow to even get water, slow to get our food, no silverware, and the food was just ok. Not compelling enough to ever come back"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best guacamole in town. The absolute BEST! The pomegranate seeds are a freaking genius touch! I love that they make it for you tableside so you can ask them to add more or less of the ingredients you prefer. 

Also, the best red sangria I have ever tasted and I am a sangria aficionado! 

Can I also say the seasoned French fries are on another level delicious? Ahhh so yummy! I absolutely love Barrio Queen. My only complaint is that the last time I visited I felt like they skimped on the fish in my fish tacos. Definitely won't keep me from coming back though!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We had to wait longer than they told us, but it was worth the wait. The HH margarita was tasty, the kids quesadilla was full of chicken, and the soup was delicious with fresh veggies and lots of chicken. I would recommend this restaurant if your looking for tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nice service and decor, but overpriced for the food.  Most places include rice and beans with their dishes.  The Barrio Queen charges $3 each for rice or beans.  Add that to $5 for drinks and dishes costing an avg of $15, and you're better off going to Filiberto's, or going to a high end steak house. 

Highly recommend going anywhere else before opening your wallet for subpar Mexican food.   They advertise it as authentic, but it's anything but."}
{"text":"Honestly I used to love this place now it gets worse and worse each time I come here. The food prices are too high for the quality of food. The service is garbage, it took them forever to serve us and the restaurant was practically empty and then they got the order wrong and I didn't even receive one of the dishes I ordered but at that point I just didn't care and asked for the bill. I tired to give it another couple chances but it's just not worth the money. Better Mexican food else where."}
{"text":"The best Mexican soul food in the valley.  No tacobellhazardouswaste here. The menu is huge but the staff is friendly and fun and really good at answering even the dumbest of questions. 

Try the enchiladas, the tortillas are homemade and delicious. The drink menu is mostly variations of the classic margarita--which they only serve on the rocks because they are doing it right! The jalapeño margarita is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! The Barrio Pollo tacos in the creamy pinion sauce are Incredible!"}
{"text":"I must not know Mexican because I love love love this place!!! 

We've tried everything on the menu and it.  Is. DIVINE."}
{"text":"I just stopped off for lunch last week. I order tacos from their \"sushi style\" Taco card. I was the Coolest concept to order taco's like you order sushi rolls. I ordered a flank steak taco with a Jalapeño stuffed with cheese and a Fish Taco . The tacos had been delivered in my to go bag as if I picked them up from a nice taco cart and the flavor was outrageously good. So much flavor, with homemade and fresh ingredients, it was definitely made with love. I cant wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"The food here has a unique style, healthy, well-presented and so tasty.  I would argue the portions are too small for the price, though.  The tequila pairings are quite good.  The inside seating is too small.  If you are at a booth chances are in the evening the butt of someone at the bar might be close to your face.  Gross: hot or not.  

Really love the décor.  If you are a fan of Dia de los Muertos this place is for you just for enjoying the ambiance.  

Do not expect traditional Mexican here.  Which is pleasant in its own way."}
{"text":"We come here for Taco Tuesdays....

Not because we're cheap, but because it takes the edge of the inevitable Scottsdale-hipster-restaurant-surcharge, and gosh darnit, the tacos are downright delish.

Also of note on the menu, the mango avocado salad.  Touche, Barrio Queen,  for presenting a lettuce-free salad option."}
{"text":"Excellent service during our late lunch visit. We both had street tacos and enjoyed them. My wife favored the fish and I gravitated towards making the carne asade steak with fried egg as mine. 
The beer was cold - my wife enjoyed the margaritas. 
Easy parking near by"}
{"text":"I love me some Mexican food and some are hard to come by that offer great food/drinks, and customer service. 
    I had the enchiladas and they were amazing! I also tried their margarita called Deaths door! It was probably the best one I've ever had! We sat outside and enjoyed the quiet view and our server was amazing!  He had great recommendations and was top notch! 

I highly recommend this place if anyone is looking for a quiet place to eat good quality food! BTW, their burritos are huge!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through Yelp.  As you can see they have GREAT REVIEWS!  The food was GREAT, the service was also GREAT!  The decor was AMAZING.  If you are looking for a CLEAN & DELICIOUS Mexican Restaurant, then this is the place!    -Sammy"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good BUT the service is a complete embarrassment to the industry. It took 45 mins to get a drink. Couldn't get silverware, plates, etc for appetizers. No customer service or awareness from the staff that they dropped the ball."}
{"text":"I had to write a review. My family came in town from Michigan they had looked into places to eat while being in Arizona. First stop was Barrio Queen. We walked in the hostess said that it would be an hour and 15 minuets for a table for 8. We requested the fire pit table out on the patio. We then walked around and went to a few other places while waiting for our table. An hour and 30 mins went by before getting a table. We were seated, gal said server would be with us shortly. Sever came about 15 mins later and took our drink order said she would be back with chips and waters about 15-30 later she comes back with waters and chips. We decided to order our meals I said we should place our order because it would prob take a while (since the drinks from the bar still had not come out yet, it was a Sunday evening and the place wasn't very busy) the server looked at me so rude. We ordered and then prob another 15-30 mins went by and our drinks finally came out. Still waiting on our entrees. ...........it was crazy the lack of care the server had to wait our table. Like we were inconveniencing her by being there. I was so embarrassed that I had taken my family there. The food finally came out. ................ I have to say the food was good  but the service was TERRIBLE. I wrote an email expressing my concerns , however the lady never followed back up with me I received one email from her then I guess she didn't care enough. I am in the service field myself and clients are always asking me for suggestions. I have to warn them and people reading this that food is good but that doesn't out weigh the poor service they give you. And for a company to not care how the servers are treating customers is sad. CUSTOMERS ARE WHAT KEEPS A BUSINESS GOING.  I will never recommend going here try a different place
Julie"}
{"text":"Yum! Awesome margaritas and great food!! Definitely worth the wait!! Good service and awesome food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers for lunch.  It was my choice and they ended up a little annoyed with me since the service was very slow and the food was not cheap.  So, not the best option for a work day lunch but I would consider coming here again in the evening.  I'd enjoy some of their yummy tacos with a beer on the patio if the sun was already down (there is no shade). Or else something from the dinner menu with a glass of wine in the swanky bistro.  I'll give them another shot but they are definitely on my coworker's \"no\" list."}
{"text":"We were actually headed to another restaurant when I saw the Barrio name.  Tires skidded to a halt, we parked and were in Barrio Queen in minutes.  This is a hip restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We settled in at the bar and Giovanny was a watchful bartender.  He made me the perfect jalapeño margarita.  Not too spicy, but very tasty. The chips and salsa were brought quickly, and believe the reviews, the salsa is delicious. I ordered the enchilada suiza- such wonderful complex flavors. My dinner mate had the Cochinita pibil which he is still raving about. This place is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Finally! We have been hungry for a good Mexican restaurant in this area and Barrio Queen did not disappoint.  As all the reviewers have said- it is popular and busy. We arrived just before 6- earlier than I wanted to -so as to get a table and to take advantage of happy hour specials. The wait was an hour and happy hour is non existent on the weekends. Oh well- at least we were the lucky ones that found seats at the bar. The bartenders were attentive and friendly, but drinks are pricey.  The noise level for such a busy place is decent- you can actually hear each other! The decor is quite nice and the outside seating is really pretty. Once we were seated, our server approached us immediately.  We ordered appetizers first, coctel de elote was delish! Once we ordered our main course, the food came out quickly and everyone loved their order.  Presentations were appealing and the taste was what I had been waiting for. Appetite satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Very warm feeling environment. Everyone that's employed there is very kind and they have great customer service skills. Taco Tuesday is a must with a waitress by the name of kimmie! She's great. We always go back to visit her! Their drinks there at the bar are great too. We've never had a bad drink or bad plate of food!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Mexican restaurants to be sure. Our server Roberto was terrific, bringing drink refills without even asking. And when I asked to split a tres leches desert he said no problem, he'd take care of it. When he brought the deserts he didn't split one, he brought out two. Very nice. We were there for Taco Tuesday and the Tacos were really tasty. Lots of flavor and a very unique and interesting menu selection. Definitely worth a revisit."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited from out of town. If you are looking for great fish tacos keep looking. The beer battered fish tacos have no batter on them?? I was so confused when they came to the table. The only redeeming part of the meal was the guacamole."}
{"text":"Really like this place, excellent location I always bring my visitors here! Taco fish really good, hotdogs, all the soups, always very friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Three tacos $10 tried all Carne asada one with the egg absolutely indescribably good - margaritas great unique taste but a bit pricy for the size of the drink - Chipotle mash potatoes is to die for - Carne asada enchilada very big portion - fresh vegetables with most dishes - guacamole made at the table maybe the best g u acamole in the country made with pomegranates chicken enchilada 9 out of 10 - house salsa WOW  - $15 per plate 7.50 per Margarita - overall it's a 9 out of a 10 - Eat here"}
{"text":"I'm here every Tuesday and it's by far 1000 times better than joyride. At least we know who are servers are over here.... at the queen."}
{"text":"Took advantage of second happy hour from 9 to close. Select food for 6$, house Margarita for 4.
Delicious food, and strong drinks. Yum :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service. Juan, our server, was exceptional and went above and beyond to make our dining experience amazing!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. Drinks are amazing food was special. We had the soup with meatballs in it that was amazing. My wife had some sort of meat soaked in Coca-Cola that was great I had chicken wrapped in banana leaves it was awesome. Sorry I don't remember the names but well worth ordering Great ambience good service Cassondra was amazing. Definitely recommend it for anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! I came for lunch with my daughter and was seated right away. 25 minutes had passed and not one person came to serve us. They served everyone around us, but ignored my little daughter and myself. The family sitting next to me was also not served and just walked out.  After freezing my butt off, I decided to leave. If you want good service look elsewhere. Even when they are not busy, they will keep you waiting. It's a pity, the food is good but they don't give a crap about service."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for so long -it looks good -heard it was good -decorated cute but  the food was NOT good!! All four meals were COLD yuck!! It was so bizarre that all of our meals were cold!! Like how long were they sitting there for them
To be served cold! Not good food. Waitress was nice but rushed. Skinny marg  was pretty good but the little glsss was not worth $11!!!! I'd recommend skipping this place!!"}
{"text":"I love love love Barrio Queen so this 3 star review kills me. I have been going to the desert ridge since the day they opened and slowly but surely the service has declined. Between extremely long wait times for a server to come to the table and nearly never coming back, sometimes the food has been close to cold, burnt chips and just all around poor experience. Please work on things team!! I love Barrio!!"}
{"text":"As a native Texan with a Mexican restaurant on every block, I am deeply and personally offended by Barrio's \"sprinkling\" of pomegranate seeds in their table-side guac. Just, why?

On a lighter note, their house made torts were legit. For these conflicting dishes, and the overall mediocrity of the menu, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour and dinner after a spring training game.  I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back.  The margaritas were very good.  Guacamole with pomegranate seeds was yummy.  Taco special for the day was the chorizo tacos, which were amazing!  I can't wait to go back and try some more options."}
{"text":"Great spot if you're in the mood for Mexican in Old Town. Lovely patio seating. Food is yummy and service is also great. 

Table side guacamole is a must and they add pomegranate seeds which is a nice touch and burst of flavor. The Queso is not your traditional Queso dish and came with mushrooms, chorizo and grilled onions. I like the Queen Enchilada dish with shrimp. It's super creamy and filled with assorted cheeses. My husband loves the red sangria because it's super sweet. 

This is a nice place to bring out of towners so you can show them the beautiful riverwalk and take a walk around Old Town before/after dining."}
{"text":"To keep it short and sweet, this place sucks. Zero flavor and bad service. 1/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"As long time friends & fans of Barrio Cafe, my husband and I were anxious to determine whether the downer reviews of BQ were for real...It's hard to believe that Silvana would allow her name and work to be compromised. Alas, after our visit today at lunch, we were very relieved to enjoy a very nice meal that represented Silvana well. We ordered three wonderful tacos (fish, chicken y chorizo, and shrimp), chile verde, a mole tamale (the mole was AWESOME) and some very tasty guacamole. My husband is a chile verde connoisseur (which means he eats it a LOT) and said the flavors were rich and complex, and better than traditional chile verde. The black beans that came with his chile verde were *clearly* made from scratch, with an unmistakably homemade flavor.  I have yet to determine if we are salt deprived or if restaurants in general err on the side of less salt -- it is a matter of personal taste -- and with a couple of dashes of salt, the flavors of our meal delighted us. 

For full disclosure, we did not have any alcoholic beverages (loved the water with thick, juicy lemon slices...mmm!)  and found that the price of lunch was very reasonable, considering our \"full\" factor when we were finished. My husband and I had been to this location when it was a French bistro (which I really did not like, mostly because of the ambience/layout of the restaurant) but Silvana has done a fantastic job of creating a fun, stylish, and festive atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again!

PS As for the naysayers like Jordan -- who I believe sat behind us at lunch (the guy bitching about the size of the tacos before he even ordered one?) -- sometimes people just bring their unhappiness with them wherever they go...If you want a \"big\" taco for $2, Taco Bell awaits you..."}
{"text":"The place is pretty from the inside I like their decor.  
The service was good and friendly.  The food is pricy but that's all the restaurants in the area are the same.  It was tasty but not as I expected.  I got the chile poblano and I though it was going to be like the chile rellenos but this one was to sweet,  I like it but it was to sweet.  
The drink was very good I got a \" vampirito\" it was spicy but very good I recommend this drink."}
{"text":"I was contemplating between a 4 and a 5 rating as I rarely give out 5 stars right off the bat, but their food did it for me.  I tend to not be a fan of gourmet taco restaurants, as any one from Mexico will tell you, Mexican food is cheap, it's just how it is, you shouldn't pay a lot of money for any of it, especially if it is really authentic.  

Barrio Queen's prices are similar to most other of these fancy type Mexican restaurants but their food is FAR better.  At most places, I feel like I'm getting ripped off when I pay $3 or more for a taco.  But wow, at Barrio Queen, I was actually impressed (hard to impress me at a place like this if you haven't caught on).  I will definitely be going back.  I ordered 3 different kinds, beef, brisket, and a chicken one with a side of rice and they were all amazing.  I will definitely be going back and bringing others with me.  

As far as the location goes, you can't beat Desert Ridge, the waitstaff was friendly and the food came promptly.  Inside was comfortable although I have to say it was the perfect temperature outside so the doors were wide open so that was a plus.  Regardless of the weather, I would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Service was an absolute joke! No greeting or anything just came to the table and asked for our drinks. He then went and put our order in and came right back and asked to order our food. I said we weren't ready and didn't even have our drinks. So he left and came back 30 minutes with our drinks and then walked away for another 25 minutes. Then he came and got our order. Didn't asked what sides we wanted or advised us on our choices. He just completely assumed. Our food came out and there was nothing great about it or traditional! Tortas was Cana asada and bread, he put in fries when I actually wanted the salad. My husbands tacos were nothing to exciting either. Asked for our check and it took him another 25 minutes to get it. We almost walked out bc it took so long for this guy to come back to our table. What a joke!"}
{"text":"We discovered Barrio Queen a few years ago and have loved it ever since. Barrio Queen always has rotating happy hour specials on tacos and a great Taco Tuesday. Most of the time we sit at the bar, with great bartenders, delicious drinks, and close proximity to the kitchen its always a great experience. 

Highly recommend the tacos (3 for $10), street corn, and table side guacamole. If my stomach was bigger I would have every taco on the menu, but my favorites are: Carne, Chorizo, and Azul, Cochinita Pibil, and Suadero Azteca."}
{"text":"I've now eaten at the Gilbert Barrio Queen twice and both times were fantastic! From the table side quacalome to the skinny margaritas...the first course was delish! I love The Queen enchiladas. They are super cheesy and the white sauce that they are smothered in is to die for. But I have to say their chips and salsa may be my ultimate fav. Their salsa is just the right spice and so flavorful! The kids meals are huge and easily shareable!! Love me some Barrio Queen!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and libations served in a great, happy atmosphere by great waiters. There's covered parking nearby and an outdoor patio. What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"Slide slide slippity slide.. instead of this being Silvanas
crowning achievement now it's just a better decorated overhyped part of a chain. I understand the energy ego and effort that went into making BQ special and it seemed no expense was spared
but the honeymoon is over. Still a great location with numerous top Tequila choices
and a some funky attractive people on Staff but wow...the thrill is gone. Management seem pretty stressed out here and the trickle down results in slightly above average service, food and the impression that the Corporate Accounting office had invisible GoPros watching over food costs and who knows what else. I guess it's hard to duplicate the love formula of Barrio Cafe forever or maybe the next project gets the special attention. 
Sad indeed."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered three tacos: one of the special cochinita pibil tacos and two camaron adado tacos. They were soggy. So wet, in fact that there was a puddle on my plate. I asked our server (who took like 15 minutes to even help us), and she said that's normal, it's because of the cabbage. What?!  Very disappointing. My hands were so covered in sticky taco water that I really wanted a shower at that point.

Additionally, the place was about half full, but they crammed all of us into one corner. So, the people behind me would jam their chair into me when they got up.

The only reason I give two stars is that, for all the water, the tacos still had really great flavor. If these had been like normal street tacos, I'd probably give this place at least 3 if not 4 stars.

I'll try it again and update later."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Great service, food and atmosphere!!! The enchiladas and guacamole are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Best AUTHENTIC Mexican food and drinks around. I've had about a dozen different items on the menu and they have all been excellent. Highly recommend the Santa Piña for a real taste me México."}
{"text":"The COCHINITA PIBIL is amazing. So tender and tasty. Also a large portion which I will enjoy tomorrow.  We had the roasted elite corn for an appetizer which is excellent. Our server Victor S was also great. E gave us very fast service and was very attentive, making sure we had plenty of chip, salsa and drink refills.
Speaking of which the home made chip and roasted salsa was great. The salsa isn't spicy, but very flavorful. I am so glad they opened this location in Desert Ridge. It save me a trip downtown since I live in this area. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food.  There is a great patio and a menu that was awesome.  Everybody at the table loved what they had."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Scottsdale area. We at Cloud LGS came in with 11 people during the heart of lunchtime and received great service. We were seated immediately, our drinks and food came out in a timely manner and the chips and salsa were constantly refilled.

I got a Carne Asada burrito and it was very filling and tasty. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic and has a rustic feel to it. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced for the area. This is a great place to go out with your business associates or on a date."}
{"text":"I really liked their tacos, they are very tasty; a friend and I ordered the mole enchiladas and chicken mole expecting to have an amazing experience but we were both disappointed, the mole lacked flavor in both dishes, I would love to try the chile en nogada but it is over priced"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Desert Ridge mall, It looked crowded and beautiful from outside with Blue lighting and Blue Umbrellas. We decided to go for a Saturday Lunch, we were told wait time is 1 hour or more, we decided to skip and try different restaurant, we then went again and there was 1.5 hour wait again.  Seeing the popularity i was curious to try it  at least once and decided to go on Sunday evening, it was way less crowded. I ordered Chips and Salsa, Chips was so oily haven't had so much oil in chips anytime ever. Also i asked for a side of guacamole, the waitress said they don't have side if Guacamole they only have huge portion of guac which is around $15(not worth for 2 people). I finally ordered the tacos, shrimp, fish and chicken, I found the tacos less spicy, tasteless, very simple nothing special. Overall not amused by this place. Will not try this place again!!"}
