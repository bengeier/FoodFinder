{"text":"Lackluster service. Confusing entry, no one greeted us. We're told eventually it would be a few minutes, then proceeded to wait 20+ minutes. 20 minutes is not a problem in and of itself, just wish they were transparent about that fact right away. Meanwhile while we waited it was clear everyone in the restaurant was frantically waiting for their food. The one host said the cook can't seat anymore. Finally we received a table outside the restaurant in a hallway! The hostess stated she couldn't guarantee food for our show at 8. It was  6:45 PM. I said that's fine but please let us know so we should know if we could find another place. She sighed and said I'll have to check with the cook, and hoped we would. We're not hard to please people. But the fountain service was seemingly designed to make even low maintenance people frustrated. Maybe it was a Saturday night issue. Likely poor staffing. But the truth is first impressions make a difference. And our group will not be coming back and we'll tell others about this experience. There's too many other good places in Madison to have an experience like this."}
{"text":"Awesome. Tommy was incredible. We had a party of 7 and were treated like royalty.  Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this last weekend - very impressed. I had a steak sandwich and sweet potato fries and my brother got a burger - we both got bloody Mary's. All delicious. Gouda with the veggies in my bloody Mary? Good call. The waitress was super nice and knowledgable about the great beer selection they have. The place reminds me of a smaller version of the Old Fashioned, and I don't have to wait forever to get a table. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"We brought 100+ people from out of town  to The Fountain for a Lacrosse team party.   Harold and his team did a great job taking care of us.  Way to go 'D', Miles and all the bartenders!  Great service and really good food!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first (and likely last) time going to The Fountain. We went in with realistic expectations of pub food but were surprised by how limited the menu was. A few \"bar plates,\" some burgers and sandwiches. Oh, there was one salad listed, but more about that later.  Our waitress had little or no knowledge about the beers available, and told us they did not have a list she could show us. Based on her limited and unhelpful information, one of us settled on a Corona, which arrived warm and without a lime. It only took two more requests to finally get that lime (but to give the waitress her due, she did remember it for subsequent rounds.). As for the food, it was hit or miss. The tomato soup was truly delicious, and appeared to be homemade. The chili had decent flavor and a nice kick, but the meat was greasy. The shrimp risotto, one of the bar plates, seemed out of place on the menu, but two of us decided to chance it. It was quite good, but the portion was ridiculously small (maybe half a cup) and included just one shrimp. The burgers were also very good. The sweet potato fries were commercially made - tasty but nothing special. The menu offered no description of the market salad. The waitress told us it featured pickled asparagus and cherry tomatoes, but it arrived without either of those items. When we pointed this out to the waitress, she went back to the kitchen and returned with a small cup of asparagus, but told us they were out of tomatoes.  Overall, the meal was disappointing and the service was worse. The only thing The Fountain had going for it last night was the jazz trio. They were great!"}
{"text":"They were out of many ingredients/dishes for a Friday night dinner.  Fries and sweet potato fries were just not good.  Grilled cheese was also disappointing.  My husband like his burger, but they didn't have all of the ingredients of their signature burger.  Drinks were good though."}
{"text":"Tried grilled cheese w/tomato soup.... I have had better! Tomato soup tasted like canned soup with some added spices and the sourdough tasted more like white bread than sourdough."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the pretty dismal service we received kind of trumped the food, which was okay - but nothing really special.  We came in on a Friday evening. We started off by seating ourselves as requested. When asked for our drink orders, they were out of both of our first choices, including Schlitz which surprised me. When I ordered a Point as a second choice, I was brought a Point Pale Ale - not really what one thinks they are getting by ordering a \"Point (aka Point Special),\" but perhaps that's just me. They were also out of the first appetizer we ordered (pretzel roll). The waiter (bartender? couldn't tell) was clearly not very experienced, did not mention any specials which we later overheard, and also flubbed my dinner order (no cheese on my cheeseburger, oh well).   As for the food - the sweet potato fries were quite good, and my burger was cooked correctly to medium and tasted fine - though pretty boring without the cheese, since it only came with a tomato slice and some shredded iceberg lettuce. My companion didn't have any complaints about his burger with smoky bleu cheese. For our sides, the potato salad was appreciated but the coleslaw was pretty bland. Overall there just wasn't anything that will have us coming back, which is disappointing because I was so ready to like this place."}
{"text":"I have been here three times by accident. We were always just around and the place was convenient, usually luring us in with some kind of special. I have never been disappointed. Their food has always been so good -- get the brat! The cheese curds are amazing. The bloodys -- oh yum and only $5. Really, everything on the menu is very reasonably priced, especially for the location. I would say the seating can be a little confusing, that's okay. The service makes up for it (I swear, there was one guy doing everything when we were there, yet you could not tell)."}
{"text":"Awful! The worst dinner I've ever eaten in Madison! Would you like some salt with a side of salt? Out of regular sized hamburger buns! And sweet potatoes! The worst thrown together portobello sandwich ever, not to mention the cheese curds were mostly breading...do not waste your time unless you want to sit around listening to anarchist hipsters! UGH"}
{"text":"Had a 6:30 reservation for six on a recent Friday night. There were empty tables so the super slow service was unexplainable and unacceptable. Finally served basic menu items (burgers, Reuben, fish fry) about 7:30. One person had to wait an additional ten minutes for a BLT. Forced to shovel down very average food to make 8:00 show at Overture Center. Waitress comped the appetizers, thus the one star."}
{"text":"We chanced upon the fountain when turned away from the old fashioned and it's 1.5 hour wait. I'm so glad we did!!! After a long day on the road (we are traveling across the country from California) the fountain was a haven to our tired bodies and hungry bellies. We started with the cheese curds, and could have stopped there--so yummy! My husband got the fountain burger. Now, he is quite a burger connoisseur, so when he said it might be the best burger he ever had, I knew it must be fabulous! I had the Ruben (suggested by our sweet, attentive, knowledgeable server) and wasn't disappointed. The bread alone made the sandwich, but the flavorful corned beef, apple sauerkraut, and dressing put it over the top. The kids shared a basket of chicken strips and gobbled the generous serving size up. So glad we made the effort to find a local place for dinner. Such a respite from the fast food fare of the last few days. And our bill was under $40. That's rare for our family of 5. You must eat here!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  I've worked in this area for about a year now and thought I had found all the good lunch spots in the capitol square area.  Add this one to the list!    Came here with some colleagues for lunch during the week.  There are two areas, the front--- which is mostly a bar area. The back area-- which also has a bar, but more dining tables.  Our service was great and so was the food.  If you're on the search for good cheese curds, check this place out.  They were light and gooey and the ranch matched perfectly (funny, but true).  They're hand breaded and locally sourced from Westby, WI.  I had the rueben which was pretty solid.  picture attached.  And yes, finally a restaurant that takes their cole slaw seriously.  Very good.  My co-worker had the Shaved Ribeye Sandwich.  The dude wouldn't shut up about how good it was! He kept saying stuff like \"this sandwich changed my life\"   and \"Wow, I didn't even need to dip it in Au Jus.\"  He had a cup of the beer cheese soup which was also very good.   Add this place to your list."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on a friday night before a show at the overture center. We had made a reservation and when we got there the staff didn't know about it, found us a table anyways though. Our waitress dropped off menus after a while and then didn't come back for a long time. Finally she came and we wanted to order 2 dinners, when she said\"Oh, I guess I should have told you that we don't serve the dinners on fridays, cause the fish fry takes up the whole kitchen\" ?!?!WTF? Ok, so we ordered 2 sandwiches...It keeps on getting later and we are really hungry and gotta make it to the show, which we told the waitress when we caught her-I mean we ordered 2 cold sandwiches, how long can it take? The place isn't exactly big! She brought the food out just after we complained and what I got was literally disgusting! A soggy sandwich that fell apart in 5 pieces when I picked it up and tried to eat it. My husbands food wasn't good either, so we ate a little and left to catch our show. It was very disappointing and we will certainly never go back there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food with a fresh, local take on their items. I highly recommend the Tom Turkey and sweet potato fries. The only downfall depending on when you go is the service - it at times can be quite slow or not the most noteworthy but the sandwiches"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch at The Fountain twice since its recent opening.  Both times the food was excellent.  My first meal was a grilled cheese sandwich, made from cheddar and provalone, grilled perfectly.  I enjoyed a rich tomotoe bisque soup with the sandwich.  Today, I wanted a hearty bowl of soup to help take the chill off.  The Fountain served up a delicious, large bowl of baked potato soup, with bacon, cheese and sour cream.  The service was friendly and accommodating.    I hope to try the place for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Just had my third experience at The Fountain and based on this time alone would give 1 star. The first time I went the burger was at least cooked to specification. The service is always slow, and I should emphasize slow. The first time it was a good 45-60 minutes to get our burgers, but it was packed.   The second time, I had their brat, which was delicious and great service (would give 4 stars that time alone). This time, over 30 minutes and barely anyone there. Order my burger medium. I haven't had a burger or red meat in awhile so had a  major craving. Imagine my disappointment biting into a well done dried up burger with barely any cheese. I will never return on my own will. HUGE disappointment! Hopefully the bartender was able to pass along my message to the kitchen because my server was too busy flirting to check on me. Bottom line, if you are going to go to The Fountain, don't order a burger, or order it rare and hopefully it will come out medium."}
{"text":"Well I heard about the Fountain from many people so I decided to give it a try.  I refuse to go to any restaurant that isn't local and corporate run, and seeing how this is local, I ventured over there. I love my reuben sandwiches, and to find one in Madison that doesn't use marbled rye is a tough act.  Not only do they use dark rye(pumpernickle) they put little chunks of apple in the kraut, very tasty.  I rate it the #1 reuben in Madison now.   I do have one complaint about it though...they put so much in it some drops out...oh well, more to eat after you finish sandwich...wish all restaurants put too much in...good selection of beers, cheese curds and mushrooms are great, and my favorite are the sweet potatoe fries...I guess they now have a fish fry dinner Fridays, can't wait to try it...love the over 100 year old bar in front bar and wallpaper is something to look at and the staff is all very friendly...back bar is very cool, stuffed furniture near a fireplace and plenty of tables to sit at and nice bar...when it was packed one night the wait was about a half hour for food, but it is well worth it!!!  I know that I have a new favorite place to go to in downtown Madison!!!"}
{"text":"I took my folks here for the Friday fish fry, and I definitely have had better elsewhere. I ordered clam chowder, which I was hoping came before the meal, but the waitress brought it with my meal.  It was on the thin side, and was somewhat bland, except for the taste of celery which outnumbered the clams.  It had no seasoning whatsoever.  I had the fried cod dinner with sweet potato fries.  The fries were way too salty.  The coleslaw was good with a touch of horseradish in it, and the pieces of fried cod were decent.  My mom ordered the baked cod, which she said was bland and dried out, like it had been microwaved.  There are better places in Madison for a fish fry, not unless you like average, bland, and salty food."}
{"text":"The Fountain Burger = the best burger in Madison!!  I'd give them 5 stars but my only hang up was our experience when we first arrived: we entered the doors off State St, and it was unclear where to go to be seated, no signs, no host.  We wandered down the hall to the bar and asked a gentleman sitting down at the bar if he worked there.  He then sat us in a booth and got the server.  After that it was OUTSTANDING.  Great wine too, great sweet potato fries and seasoned fries, and the burger was outrageously good."}
{"text":"My best friend was in town and we were looking to grab a bite to eat before heading over to see Dueling Pianos.  This place was nearby and I had heard good things about it.   It was busy and crowded and quite a few people milling around when we first walked in (surprisingly though, it wasn't loud until the live music started up).  I was confused as to how seating worked because there did not seem to be a hostess, but there was no seat yourself sign either.  Luckily, a few seats at the bar opened up, and we nabbed those right away.  The bartender was very nice and attentive and we only had to wait a few minutes before he asked what we wanted.  My boyfriend and I split chicken tenders and cheese curds and my best friend ordered the turkey club.  Their beer selection was expansive and the prices were fantastic.   After about 10-15 minutes, the bartender came over and told my friend that they were unfortunately out of turkey.  He was very apologetic and asked what else he could get for her.  She decided on chicken tenders as well.  My boyfriend and I got our food shortly after that.  The cheese curds were great; they were fried in batter that reminded me of onion rings.  They were not super greasy or heavy which was a major plus.  The chicken in the tenders looked and tasted like actual chicken- not something you find very often anymore!  I also really liked all the sauce choices they had available.   Because the kitchen had run out of turkey and because my friend had to wait so long for his food, the bar comped us a round of drinks and took half off her food.  They really take care of their customers at this restaurant!  I noticed the owner chatting to various patrons, many of which appeared to be regulars at the bar.  If you want to go to a local bar/restaurant that has great food, good selection, and actually treats its customers like people, definitely check out Fountain.  The only reason I took a star off was because seating was confusing."}
{"text":"This place is often overlooked, but it shouldn't be!  Things I've tried:  Fountain Burger - I've had a lot of good burgers in Madison and this one is high up there. The aged cheddar is so rich it dominates the palate but still plays nice with the other toppings. This is a very tall burger but I was somehow still able to bit into it without everything being forced out the backend. Highly recommend if you don't mind $15 for the burger.   Cheese curds - I've been a long time fan of OF's but these just might be better! I enjoy that they are lightly breaded and didn't seem as greasy as most places. The ranch was also pretty good but was more of a mild flavor that complimented the natural flavor of the curds nicely."}
{"text":"It's kickoff time at the start of the Wisconsin-Nebraska game. Looking for a haunt for a group of 8, I stumble upon The Fountain, nearly deserted despite drink specials and HDTVs showing the Wisconsin domination beginning. Meanwhile, the Tiki Shack next door hopped with a boisterous, sloppy crowd. Was this a bad sign?  Not in the least. The bartenders and waitress took great care of us over the whole game. The smart tap list (all Wisconsin, mostly Madison) is accompanied by a good selection of bottles. We were surprised by the complementary chips and salsa, and at one point the chef even brought out some delicious beef sandwiches for the group to sample. I didn't try any, but I've never seen people react that positively to a beef sandwich before. A few of us ordered cheese curds and fries, which came quickly and were also very good.   Lots of little touches made this place stand out, including a gluten-free beer offering, the aforementioned freebies and the great mural on the wall, which I didn't have much time to study on account of too many Badger touchdowns.  We'll definitely be back. Looking forward to trying sandwiches and the \"Beers of our Fathers\" list, if only because Blatz has been the punchline of many a joke since I've moved here. Wisconsin Regional cuisine seems to be on the up-and-up in Madison, and this place offers an easy-going, friendly version."}
{"text":"Came here around 5pm on a Saturday night. Completely dead. Decided to give it a try because we were hungry. Our server/bartender knew nothing about the beers that were on tap. Ordered cheese curds which were very tasty. I got the fountain burger and my sister got a Rueben sandwich. Both very good. The food is nothing to complain about. The staff is very odd. Large restaurant that is split up into two sections. While our server was taking our order, a cook of some sort came up to her and handed her a sandwich, presumably for the bar. Unprofessional and weird. Our food came out shortly after our app of curds. Our \"server\" showed up and the cook who ran our food yelled at the server, \"Haley, you gotta run your own food!\" In front of us. Just very odd staff. I don't enjoy being made uncomfortable when I am going out to eat. Maybe if it was busier and the staff wasn't walking around like they had nothing to do, it would be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I came with such high hopes from other reviews and found that the burgers are not that fabulous after all.    Yes yes. I love the vibe, I am curious and am planning to be back for live music.   The place was kinda confusing.. I entered from the front door at state street, saw a drumset and a bar but there was no one to help us. So my boy and I headed to the area at the dark area at the back and finally saw something like a reception. FYI, there's the front bar and back bar....  So what to try? Cheese curds was good as mentioned. The crumbs were special, reminding me of a fish fry batter at Long John Silver's if you ever had it. But i still prefer the ones at Graze cos the ones at fountain have empty cheese curds (batter with no cheese) Fried onion straws - similar to the old fashioned.   Skip the following, BOO!!! Pulled pork sliders. Not enough sauce so the pork was rather dry. Taste was good. And it was cheap and came with chips.. The server was so puzzled about us getting the 2 free toppings -.- Fountain burger - no patties here please. It was supposed to be medium rare and turned out charred on all sides"}
{"text":"Very loud for my taste on a monday night, but the man working the bar was beyond attentive. I tasted the well-balanced Reuben and some gooey fluffy delightful battered cheese curds."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite new place downtown - like an unpretentious, friendlier, and easier to get a table Old Fashioned. Good drink specials, love the pretzel bun, and their bloody mary. They also have a Belly check-in for those of you using that service."}
{"text":"The Fountain used to be great ... it did truly have the best burgers in town, great curds and good fries ... but sadly it has experienced a serious downturn in quality ... new and unimpressive menu ... and the food we ordered from the blah menu was not even good.    No longer lives up to my previous review of 6/13/2015"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try on Thursday night! What a great stop. I enjoyed the naked beer they had on tap and grabbed an awesome burger to go with it. The burger was ground fresh in house cooked just the way I asked served on a pretzel bun and topped with some melted cheese. The burger was absolutely delicious and so juicy. It was served with some perfectly seasoned fresh cut fries. You are missing out if you don't give this place a try."}
{"text":"Used to be a fun place. The food isn't as good as it used to be. The only reason my wife and I go there is to see the piano man Richard Shatin on Fridays. Now the the bartenders have been changed it is hard to want to go there. AJ is fine and Jennifer is not here. The fellow tonight seems mediocre at best and my beer is in a plastic cup. First time ever. It isn't even busy. Come at your own accord."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was the first place we saw while looking for a restaurant with our overly tired children. There were pros and cons.  Pros: super friendly staff. Seriously our waitress was so nice and understanding that we had brought our small kids into this bar.  Cons: the fries tasted as if they hadn't been cooked. Almost like raw potatoes. Not good.  The clam chowder was all doctored up with bacon and other things that it ended up not being very tasty."}
{"text":"I like going here on Taco Tuesdays. They offer $1.50 beef tacos, $2.00 chicken tacos, and $2.00 pork tacos. I really recommend the chicken and pork. They come topped with cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, cilantro, onion and your choice of mild or hot salsa. I was really impressed with the fact that they use double corn tortillas instead of the tasteless flour tortillas that most places use. Their fries are also really good, so get those too, However, I do not recommend the beef tacos. I've had the beef tacos on one occasion and there was something off about the flavor. I've heard good things about their burger, so I'll have to try that soon. As of now, I'll be seeing you all on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"We will DEFINITELY be back...the food was great, the server was super friendly and attentive (but not annoying/let us sit and chat too) and the atmosphere of the dining area can't be beat...a definite gem in the Madison area that I would not have guessed from walking by it in the past...  The burgers were huge and cooked perfectly!  I would definitely recommend \"The Fountain\" burger.  Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for cheesecurds and a few beers.  The curds are a bite of heaven with very light breading....very light, almost nonexistent breading.  #wortheverycalorie"}
{"text":"Tried some beer and cheese soup for the first time. IT WAS GOOD!!!! Also had a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. The cheeseburger was very good the cheese was inside the burger like some super cheesy treat! The bacon was really good too (I think being in Wisconsin has something to do with that. I mean it is a dairy state!"}
{"text":"We ate here before a show at The Overture Center. What a great casual place. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. My food was great, I got the 122 Tom Turkey Club, basic club with their own twist, delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"The Fountain is great! My friend and I went there tonight and met practically everyone who worked there because they were all so friendly! Our bartender, tommy had many corny jokes that made our night. Go any time:)"}
{"text":"We tried the fountain as a gathering spot for a group of us headed to the comedy club on a Saturday night.  It served its purpose.   They have an extremely limited menu- burgers, soup and salad.  I had a Fountain burger.  It was an absolute mess- 2 patties with cheese smooshed between them.  It was definitely the talk of the table as it was huge with meat juices dripping all over.  Its what i was looking for-  a big mess of a burger.  My girlfriend decided to try THE Reuben.  Now if you are brave enough to put \"THE\" in front of any sandwich name, it better be exceptional.  It wasn't.  Corned beef was dry and there was little or no dressing.  It was a disappointment.  My girlfriend said reubens at her work cafeteria were better.    This place has a ton of potential.  Its a large space with 2 bars and outdoor seating in the summer.  Expand the menu. Give me a reason to go back besides its location"}
{"text":"We tried the cheese curds because we told they were among the best in town.  The might be, if you like lots of breading with bits of cheese.   The portobello sandwich had to be marinated in salt.  The mozzarella on it was dry and lacked any flavor. With all the salt you wouldn't be able to taste it anyway.  The chicken salad sandwich....the filling was minimal, the toasted bread was brushed (soaked) in butter.   The Rubin was tough and hard to eat.  The 4th person in our group ordered the bbq pork sandwich. He said it was good but certainly not worth coming back for.  Our water glasses were never refilled. Over all it is a thumbs down for all of us.     As a positive the sweet potato fries were good."}
{"text":"Don't know how many stars to give this?? Yelp says they are open but they aren't. Walked a long way to try the food. Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"My burger experience in Madison has been absolutely phenomenal thus far.  The Fountain Burger is the way to go. Although it changes with the times, I just remember how rich the aged cheddar was on my burger. Throw in some of their special sauce and you have one of the best in Madison! Why stick with one burger joint when you can have them all??  They had a man playing the piano as well, which set a great vibe."}
{"text":"Good. The Fountain burger was a nice patty of high quality chuck covered in bacon and cheese. It was charred but still managed to miss an element--perhaps something as simple as salt or onion powder? The pretzel bun really tasted like a pretzel, and though the mustard aioli didn't add much I like the concept. Also there were a few chewy pieces of meat. Fries were fine. Prices a little above average. I'd return, especially after and for a few more beers."}
{"text":"Really great burgers.  Lots of nice menu selections with a Wisconsin theme and locally sourced ingredients.  Well thought out beer list, again with a WI focus.  Good wines too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the ability for small appetizer style ordering.  I often want several things off the menu and I love that their appetizers are well priced and portioned so that I can order 2 or 3 and satisfy my fickle ordering nature.    I ordered a housemade seasonal pasta dish, pickled vegetables appetizers and a slider.  Their slider is totally worth it at $3.  It even comes with a little bit of fries.  It's the perfect size.  The pickle dish was also delicious.  It's drizzled with a reduced balsamic vinegar giving it the perfect sweetness to balance the acidity.  I found their pickled ground cherries delightful, and for someone who normally doesn't like mushrooms, their pickled mushrooms had a beautiful meaty flavor without being slimy.  I wasn't super wowed by their pasta dish, but it's listed as seasonal on the menu so it changes and I would definitely be interested in their other pastas.    The Fountain is also a pretty nice music venue.  I like that when there is a band, it's not so loud that I can't hear my dining partner if we leaned in a bit, but also loud enough that I can tune out the other patrons determined to talk over the music.  The entrance to this place is a little odd, but overall, a charming place."}
{"text":"Since there was a thunderstorm when we wanted to go barhopping around our hotel (The Madison Concourse Hotel and Governor's Club), we decided to stop by somewhere close by first. We saw The Fountain and quickly ran in.   The bar was spacious, and surprisingly very empty for a Friday night. That was quite a bummer since the vibe wasn't great for a night out. We were able to watch a live band playing though, which was cool.   Drinks are cheap - 7 cocktails and 7 shot specials (with whipped cream and cinnamon) ended up being only $44. We're definitely not in the bay area anymore. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm very confused.  How does this place have a high rating?    The space is bizarre but could be kitschy if it weren't for the service, food and cleanliness (or lack thereof).    We sat at the bar and the new bartender didn't know how to make an old fashioned.  Wow.    Piano player is a cool touch but it doesn't make up for the shortcomings on every other level."}
{"text":"After a rocky first visit (burger was cooked well done but the saving grace was the chef coming out to apologize), the Fountain has really delivered quality consistent food.  Their burgers are made from local ingredients and are very solid.  Cheese curds are amongst the best in town (Graze are still the best).  Very friendly waitstaff with a barback that is over 100 years old.  While not as diversified as the Tipsy Cow (and not even close to the Old Fashioned), I like coming here for the great people and food."}
{"text":"Pick from the front bar or the back. Some of the best cheese curds around. Burger was top notch as well. Stop on in for see great food and good beers."}
{"text":"First time here last night.  Live jazz combo was great, but the food was just ok and quite over-priced.  Our server was fair at best."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the Yelp-photo hype. I ordered a hamburger with a side of fries and cheese curds as an appetizer (they looked amazing based on some of the photos posted). Overall the meal was bland. My burger wasn't special and the fries had a strange sugary taste to them. My friends also agreed that the fries were barely eatable. The cheese curds were OK but many other places in the Madison-area offer much, much better. Service was good, wait time was nonexistent when I visited."}
{"text":"Some friends and I popped in to The Fountain for a post-dinner drink last weekend. We went with their special of the night, screwdrivers with fresh-squeezed OJ. It was pulp-free and you couldn't taste the vodka, so it was fine by me (I'm not a big fan of OJ or vodka).   The bartender (and presumable owner) was very friendly and very excited about their food menu - it's nice to see someone who is passionate about what they're doing.   The bar is warmly lit and has an old-timey feel, and they did a great job of opening the flow between the front and back room, something the former occupant TIki Shack lacked. I'm interested to give them another go-round."}
{"text":"Torn between one and two stars here. The Fountain is conveniently located on State St. The concept is so cool - Wisconsin style bar with Wisconsin style food but sadly the execution is not well done. The group I was with was not thrilled with the selection for beers on tap (this should be a must at a Wisconsin style bar). Our server was slow and really didn't know much about the menu - but he did tell is in detail about why the Mac and cheese option was terrible. Some people on our group got burgers and they said for the price you can get a much better burger in Madison (try Cooper's Tavern!). I had the roast chicken and it was fine by me anything stand out. Probably won't try his place again."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.   The Fountain is kind of weird. It's split into two sections, sometimes has nice, fairly unobtrusive live music, and is generally pretty empty. The food is fine, but nothing special. In terms of their menu and pricing it seems like they're competing with the Old Fashioned. The problem is that their food isn't as good as the OF's and their portions, while ample, don't compare. The menu is also fairly short. They make a solid burger, fairly average sandwiches, and not much else.   Service is always friendly, but there are some bizarre hiccups. Two people in our party of six ordered grilled cheese and it came out at least seven or eight minutes before everyone else's entree. As the waiter explained, \"Grilled cheese doesn't take as long to cook.\" Umm, yeah, I know-- that's why you wait a few minutes to start it.   I do have to say that these guys have hands down the best Bloody Mary in Madison. The garnish is incredible-- they gave me thick slices of cheddar cheese, summer sausage, and a friggin' barbecue shrimp. Hot damn.   Edit: I attended an event at the Fountain tonight with catered food and a cash bar. The food was awful-- baked fish was horribly over cooked-- and the Bloody Mary came with a slice of lemon and a slice of lime. Goodbye awesome garnish and goodbye third star."}
{"text":"After being informed that the wait time was close to an hour and a half at The Old Fashioned, my boyfriend and I stumbled across The Fountain. It seemed to be pretty similar to The Old Fashioned as far as the menu was concerned so we said why not. It wasn't very crowded at all. The food is made from local products, which is always a plus. We ordered some cheese curds to start, and I ordered the Red Lager Brat (single) and my boyfriend had the Pulled Pork Sandwich.   The cheese curds were really good. They're kind of like cheese sticks but a million times better. The brat came on a pretzel bun with a ton of sauerkraut. It made for messy eating but was hearty and delicious. My bf said his sandwich was good too. Our server was very, very attentive and would show up every 5-10 minutes to see how we were doing. I'll let you decide if that's a bad thing or not. The other sandwiches and burgers on the menu looked like they were worth a second visit, so I expect I'll be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Don't come here, they can't handle any more customers.  7:30 on Friday evening- \"sorry, we're out of spotted cow\" \"sorry, we're out of block party\" \"sorry, we're out of Pimm's\" \"sorry, we're out of the pulled pork\" \"sorry, we're out of the soup of the day\" Asked us how we wanted the burgers done, and we told them various temperatures. No fewer than 75 minutes later, we were presented with burgers, one at a time, with no mention of the temperature (they were all the same). Some of the burgers came out, then 10 more minutes passed, then almost all of the rest of the food came out. One member of our party was completely forgotten. Fries were burnt to a crisp, burgers were fine but not worth $15. Yes, some of our food was comped for this. No, I still won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This recent addition to the State St. milieu has no pretension.  In fact, it is visually something of a work in progress.  In spite of a lack of an identity with regard to the decor, the menu leaves no doubt that there is a strong Wisconsin theme present.  Comparisons to the Old Fashioned Restaurant on the square are not off base, but until this place gets a stronger reputation, a patron need not feel threatened by the comparative level of sound from which there is no escape at the OF.  The lunch menu (http://www.thefountainofmadison.com/menus/Menu.pdf)  reveals a well aspected variety which showcases some of Wisconsin's better food ideas.  I was led to the reuben by one of the staff, who also hyped up the fact that the meat was cured in-house and featured a homemade thousand island dressing.  The referral did not disappoint, but those seeking an over the top \"quantity\" reuben should look elsewhere.  The accompanying coleslaw was disappointingly served at room temperature (could that dressing have been prepared by \"Che Sysco\"?).  I was also pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of an IPA by Big Bay Brewing Co. from Shorewood Hills in Milwaukee.  Anyway, I wish them luck and will give them another spin soon."}
{"text":"Ok Here is the scoop: Went here on Sunday because I have had the place bookmarked for ages.  Pros: The Outdoor Seating was great for a nice spring day. The burgers were absolutely incredible, as were the cheese curds.  Lastly, my sweet potato fries were delish.  Cons: The Service was super slow. They seemed to be understaffed for the business they had. Only other complaint is parking can be a pain.  Go when you have some free time!"}
{"text":"Oh I am thinking about those sweet potato fries as I type this. The number of crispy onions on my chicken sandwich is too damn low. Burgers are good, cheese curds are good, chicken is good. I can't wait to go again, but I may have to work up my loud talking voice to be heard in this joint."}
{"text":"Honestly, I know people are nice to you when you're paying them, but I hang out at The Fountain and can honestly say that the three people I've talked to on a regular basis are not only courteous and good at their job, but SO cool and nice. I have a regular rapport with Ruthie and Ryan, and Heather, one of the chefs is incredibly nice and real as well. Their reuben is also really good and I think I'm literally going to go grab a Hopalicious and eat one right now!"}
{"text":"Loved the food (had a reuban), great service from the bartender, and did not wait more than maybe 10 minutes max for my food. My impression of the decor was that it kind of seemed like a smaller, less pretentious version of Old Fashioned and kind of reminded me of the basement bar of the Heidelberg in Ann Arbor (if there's any chance someone would understand that reference). Also loved that it wasn't too loud and seemed a little more intimate than a lot of the other bars around the square. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have dinner and/or drinks where they can easily talk to people in a relaxed setting."}
{"text":"We went into this place impulsively because it was near our hotel and we were famished. The place was pretty much empty at 430 so we got the funny bartender's antics all to ourselves. That part was fine. The fish fry, unfortunately, was quite disappointing. Portions were smallish and the fish lacked flavor and seemed overdone. Or something. Fries were meh. It just simply didn't pop. We asked if they had malt vinegar for that British fish and chips touch and they brought back cider vinegar. I do not recommend cider vinegar as a condiment. Anyway, really nice staff, decent ambience. Ok place but maybe just skip it if you're in the mood for fish and chips."}
{"text":"I ended up heading here after an awesome review in the Isthmus. My dad was in town heading to a hockey game with my brother and me. I thought I'd bring the boys here since I wanted to try it and it wasn't as busy as some of the college hang-outs (e.g. The Nitty). The food was good and the servers were kind, but it was a little small and not a lot of variety on the menu. We all got burgers/sandwiches, and they were tasty, but nothing out of this world. I would head back soon for the bar, however, as they have great drink specials, and the staff was nice. Cool bar."}
{"text":"I have to say I don't get the hype about this place.  After many good reviews by local press I gave this place a try.  In a party of three, two complete failures on our food.  First, one burger was over-cooked to the point of being completely dry and un-edible.  Second, when you can order a \"burger\" with a portobello mushroom traded for beef, it's supposed to be a whole mushroom cap so you can eat it like a burger.  When the mushroom is cut into many thin slices it's impossible to eat as a sandwich.  Cheese?  forgotten.  Salad Dressing?  forgotten.  Service?  Poor, and slow.  It seemed like the nice people working there were trained as bartenders, not waitstaff.  One star for the cheese curds, they were good, but I'm never going back.  There are too many places near there that have their act together and serve good food that I can give my business to."}
{"text":"Trying to find a place to eat on a Saturday is crazy, luckily we came across this place. The burgers were delicious! The BBQ Cheddar Burger is SO good, I was pleasantly surprised as to how yummy it was. The beer selection was decent and the service was really good. I would definitely go back, especially for the BBQ Cheddar Burger!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly with some friends, instantly loved it. I don't know what the front bar is like, because I always go to the back bar. It's much more laid back there. The drinks are amazing, there isn't really a drink menu but the bartenders know how to make some badass cocktails. See if Luke is bartending at the back bar. Also, ask about the blind melon, it's with fresh watermelon and fresh strawberry juice. It's my new favorite drink of all time. The food is pretty awesome as well, they have a late night menu 10-close. The tacos are good, but if you tell the cooks you want it spicy, beware, they will make it spicy. Seriously this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very cool place - we were the first people in on a Saturday - sitting on the bar side - had some amazing little burgers.  Server was very nice - food was really good - place was really cool.  Glad we came in and hope to be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the fountain 3 times now, and I have not been disappointed. The Reuben, which I ordered two of the 3 times, is now my second favorite Reuben in town. The Cecil, a venison summer sausage sandwich, is also excellent. My friend called the Forward Burger one of the best burger's he's ever had, which is high praise from a guy who's tried most of the burger's in town. Their cheese curds are fantastic as well, definitely in my top five.  The bar itself is a very nice space, small but cozy, with nice decor and an awesome old school back bar. We were lucky enough in a couple of our visits to get a chance to talk to the chef, who we could tell took great pride in his menu and really cared about the experience he was delivering. The bartender, also an owner, was friendly and attentive too.   I've been talking the place up to my friends and co-workers, and I hope to come back many more times."}
{"text":"My family and I were in Madison the first weekend of December as my oldest is part of the high school debate team.  Being 'flatlanders' and not even remotely familar with Madison, our first night there, we were looking for a good family style local place to eat.  Our hotel recommended The Old Fashion but The Fountain was literally within falling distance from the hotel and, as we were asking for directions to the Old Fashion from staff of The Fountain (unbeknownest to us-- they were even friendly in giving directions to one of the competitors!!)-- we looked at each other and thought \"Why not, we're already here\" (especially after we were informed that they were quite proud of their cheese curds).  Couldn't have made a better \"accidental\" choice!  Several locals seemed to be in the place and were eating (can't be bad if the locals are eating there).  The staff were extremely friendly (have to give a huge hello and thank you to our server NAOMI, great gal, knowledgable about the menu items, the beer, and even other good places to eat for breakfast and lunch for the next day!! How do you get better than that??) .  I had the red lager brat (single) my wife had the cheese burger, and the kids had the chicken tenders (the oldest was with his school group).  Of course we had to start with an order of the cheese curds (never had any real Wisconsin types, only fast food imitations here in Illinois).  Also had a side salad and one of the local micro brews [just ask for a Cow].  Couldn't believe how good the food was in general.  The only complaint to mention was the char for my wife's cheeseburger but that's primarily due to her dislike of char than the burger itself.  As many of the items on the menu that can be locally and organically sourced are sourced from local and organic growers (they even have their own pastry/ desert baker on staff and everything she makes is organic and local-- DO THE BROWNIE IF SHE HAS THEM AVAILABLE ON THE NIGHT YOU VISIT!!).  Interiorly, it does look rustic/ well loved/ well used but we kinda liked that feel.  Good prices too.  Had we been able to stay later they were going to have a live jazz band but needed to get the yougers to bed.  Would definately go back and would truly recommend it to others.  I'm not to sure why the hotel didn't seem to recommend it as it is sooooo close to their front door but I would really recommend it."}
{"text":"Did not like.  The service was lackadaisical and the bartender made me the worst Arnold Palmer I have ever had.  The beer taste in the drink gave me question cleanliness.  We ate in the upstairs where there was a pianist who made some questionable music choices including Suicide is Painless, which should never be happy hour song.  The burger was okay, the patty was overcooked but the meat was good as was the blue cheese.  I did love the fries.  My husband liked the stuffed Portobello but thought they were heavy handed with the balsamic glaze.  The dry rubbed wings were amazingly salty even for bar food and really lacked a pleasurable flavor.  The worst was the cherry coke, made apparently with 50 percent grenadine."}
