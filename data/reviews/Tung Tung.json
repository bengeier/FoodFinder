{"text":"The big difference between this Tung Tung Dan Quen King and the ones in Market Village and Pacific Mall is that this one is relatively low traffic. If I'm not mistaken, they use this one primarily to package sweet egg rolls. However, they do still sell Hong Kong egg waffles. These egg waffles are just as delicious as the ones from their other stores, but they're not as fresh. They pre-make two and then if you order, they give those two to you. They're still warm, because they've been resting on the egg waffle makers, but they're not piping hot. If you don't eat your egg waffles piping hot, you're really missing out.  I'm tempted to buy them each time I walk past this store, and well, all around the mall, cuz the smell actually does waft that far, but each time I do, I'm slightly disappointed by the fact that my egg waffles aren't hot."}
{"text":"It's the only Tung Tung location I know in Scarborough, a good place to get gaidanjai without having to go all the way to Pacific Mall or Market Village to their other locations, which is just about the same distance. I've actually never tried their eggrolls, I want to try that next time. Also never tried their drinks nor ice-cream but meh, not too hot about getting those kinds of snacks here.  I bought the classic gaidanjai, which is 2 for $5CAD. I think it would be cool if they added chocolate ones since they have that at the location in Market Village, even if they charge more for it. The gaidanjai was hot but just right for eating- as warm wouldn't be the appropriate word for it, soft, filled with egg flavour. You should eat it right after buying 'cause if you leave it out for ten minutes or more, the inside of it will be cold. It's still okay for eating, but it's not as good as when you bought it right away.  The girl working that day was nice and chatted with my grandma and I, so I found their service to be friendly. We chatted about how the gaidanjai in Hong Kong is really crispy and lacks egg flavour like the ones made in Toronto, and she offered the reason for that to us. She made the gaidanjai for us right away when we ordered it, we got to watch her make it so I know it was fresh for sure. I would definitely return next time I'm around here."}
{"text":"Happen to pass by and got a wiff of the \"gaidanjai\". Gotta stay consistent with Letty W. after all as she was the first to review this place :) For the people who are not Chinese it is the Chinese way of pronouncing it. I gots no idea what its called in English though. I think I will call it little eggie puffs.    Picked up one gaidanjai and a pack of eggrolls which came to $7 taxes in. The gaidanjai was a bit softer than I would have liked it but they still tasted good. I like mine to have a crispy outer layer. I found a solution to this though. I brought them home and put them in the toaster and vuala - Tasted fresh again and had a nice crisp just like I wanted."}
