{"text":"Pizza never delivered - multiple charges on credit card - they pick up the phone and hang up. At a minimum, this is a crew of scammers. Beware."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.

In placing a phone order on a calm Sunday night I had completed my order and was asked if I would be paying cash or credit. I responded with credit and I was asked to hold while she got my total. Ok, that seems reasonable except then I heard the girl resume a call she had placed in hold, apparently 'hold' there means setting the phone down and picking up another one. She proceeds to take another delivery order on the other  phone (apparently a cash delivery) and after a few minutes picks up line I am on and asks for my card number....

Well, obviously this entire set of events had me taken back a bit, I had never seen such a blatant disregard for a customer wanting to give a business money before. So, I said, do you realize that I could hear you take that other customers order? She said yes.... Hmmm, ok, kind of odd. At this point I thought it best to talk to a manager so I asked her to put the manager on the line. She said that there wasn't a manager available.... Again, very strange. So, I asked for the name of the manager and a number that I could call him back at. Then she called for someone and all of a sudden the 'manager' was in the phone.

I explained the situation and he said he apologized, I said I think you should give me a discount on this order. He said, why would i do that? Again, I was taken back by this response, I mean what is it to knock a couple bucks off an order for such poor service. I asked him to cancel my order and hung up the phone.

As a result of this experience, I wouldn't recommend this business to anyone. Support one of the other pizza joints in the area that care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Will not order from Redline Pizza ever again. Placed an order online for a cheese pizza with one half pineapple and ham, and when my boyfriend showed up to pick the order up they had made a whole pineapple/ham pizza. Because of vegetarian requirements he told them he did need a cheese pizza, so he waited 20 more minutes for them to make a cheese pizza, and instead of just remaking the original order they then handed him the new pizza and had him pay for that as well. 
Though I wouldn't have paid for their mistake, my easygoing boyfriend did. Redline, you're not getting anymore of our money for your below par pizza and service."}
{"text":"Person answering the phone was short spoken and almost rude. I was quoted 45 min delivery and it was an hour. Once delivered the pizza was cold, poor quality and somehow the two toppings were wrong??
I Won't try again, I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"For the record, I teetered between three and four stars on this one, so more accurately you could say this is a 3.5 star review, but I decided we'll go with four because I do enjoy this place and I probably will continue ordering from them. 

Like so many others, I get these fliers taped to my door ridiculously often. However, I get it -- small businesses need to advertise. I'd probably be less than pleased if I caught the fellow taping the ad to my door, but everyone has a job and a small business has to get the word out somehow. No real gripe from me on that front, and even so much as dropping the rating because of advertising would be vindictive at best and petty at worst. 

So, on to the matter at hand. Skip to the bottom if you want the TL;DR version of this.

My only real complaint are that the first time I ordered pizza here, it was a tad on the under-done side. Not horribly so, but a bit less crispy than I like. That's all a matter of preference; it was definitely in the acceptable range of pizza done-ness, albeit firmly on the lower end. The other times I've ordered it's been exactly as I like it to be, so take that as you will. 

The only other thing I could possibly mention would be that they really seem to love Doctor Pepper, because every time I've ordered Coke, I've gotten Doctor Pepper. Probably just coincidence together with a hasty delivery driver, but it's not a big issue for me since I like Coke and Doctor Pepper pretty much the same. Still, I would caution the owners to carefully read the orders: a lot of my friends seem to fancy themselves soda connoisseurs and would be irrationally outraged at this mix-up, which would only lead to more people posting one-time-order \"I'm ticked off\" reviews. 

I'm sorry to have started out with the drawbacks, but that's what most people really are concerned about. If you, reader, also want to know what I've liked about this place, keep reading. 

The biggest thing that keeps me coming back here is the value. Compare the prices at Redline to just about any other pizza joint -- especially the big names -- and you'll see why they keep getting green from my wallet. I can get a 20\" pizza -- bigger than it sounds -- for around $15. Not bad at all! The pizza itself is a little bit on the bland side, sure, (maybe throw on a little butter and some Parmesan to the crust edges, Redline?) but it's got a good ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings to crust, so the foundations of a good pizza are all there. 

The staff has been nothing but friendly to me thus far, but I also haven't really had a complaint yet, so we'll see how that turns out if it ever happens. This review will be updated accordingly if that should occur. 

The best thing is there are none of the gimmicks like what Pizza Hut, Papa John's, and all the big places are trying. I don't need pretzel crust on my pizza. No, I don't need miniature hot dogs stuffed into my crust either. What is this stuff you're drizzling all over my pizza? No, seriously, what even is that? If I wanted strange and exotic pizza, I'd take the trip down to Chandler Mall and visit their California Pizza Kitchen. This is a refreshing return to simplicity. Pizza, wings, soda, and a delivery driver to bring it right to my lazy butt in exchange for a fair tip. (Honestly, guys, if you can't afford to tip your driver, just hop your butt into the car and pick it up. I've done it when I was a bit tighter on cash.)

To summarize: 

Pros:
Inexpensive
Good portions
Simple
Friendly service

Cons: 
Pizza's done-ness can be unpredictable
Maybe a little TOO simple at times. Crust should be eaten; make me WANT to eat it.
Strange brand loyalty to Doctor Pepper? Yeah, this one is mostly a joke, but worth pointing out.

In short: Yes, I would recommend you give these guys a try. If they don't hit on the head the first go round... try 'em again. My second time was a lot better than my first. If that doesn't do it, then sure, move on. I'm sure that some people simply won't like the same things I do."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had the misfortune of being in contact with. As a college student, I am broke and my mom wanted to order me pizza. I got a flyer from redline on my door today and didn't see anywhere on their site or flyer saying the card had to be presented at time of delivery so I thought it would be fine for her to call in the order. The delivery driver gets to my apartment and asks to see the card. I explain that my mother purchased the food for me and all he does is say \"No card, no food\" and walks away. I call the restaurant and try to explain what happened and explain that they should have a note somewhere on their site stating the card needs to be present at delivery and am promptly hung up on. 

I am sure the food is good, but I deserve to be at least listened to."}
{"text":"if it was my choice I wouldn't even give them one star. This place is dirty they have roaches and they are rude as hell. with a little business that they do get they don't even appreciate that. I call to cancel my order because they told me it will be over in an hour for delivery so I cancel my order and they hung up in my face and when I called to make sure that my order was canceled the message yes it was and called me a bitch before he hung up. very rude customer service that can barely even speak English"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza and calson and wings not that long ago and the person that answered the phone was really respectfull... I waited for my order on 57 N Alma School and I had a delivery guy get to my house I gave him $40 and asked for my change but he seemed to get upset and I told him \"you know what man keep the change as the tip\" and when I opened up my box of pizza and wings everything looks super delicious and amazing thank you guys for making such amazing food"}
{"text":"My name is Jessica, I just ordered from Redline Pizza and the club and salad a pizza look amazing but when i called to tell them that there was no cheese on my club sandwich the manager told there was and that i needed to order extra cheese next time. he was really rude i will not go back to Redline Pizza again.  How can a customer be wrong i am the one eating the sandwich i know what cheese taste like, cheese is my favorite food.  i do not understand why he was so rude most places compensate you or at least try to help fix the problem.  HE did nothing."}
{"text":"The pizza here is the large and thin style that I love. It is very similar to the Sbarro's places you see in malls.

They have a \"20/20\" deal where for $20 you get a giant 20 inch pizza, a bunch of chicken wings with your choice of sauce and a large bottle of your choice of soda.

If I got those items at a Pizza Hut or Papa Johns I'd probably pay near double.

They also have calzones, pasta etc. 

The only downside so far to me is that their bread sticks are too bland."}
{"text":"Love that they are open later than just about every other place around, but not one of those crappy open all night places designed to feed drunks. 

Delivery is almost always prompt-even when they say it's going to be longer.
The pizza is excellent, and very reasonably priced to other places. The cheesecake is pretty good too, and half the price of other places I order from.

One drawback-I ALWAYS ask for extra cheese on my pie, and they NEVER put extra cheese on it. Never. I offer to pay extra, just put extra cheese on it....never happens.


I've given up trying, and just deal with what I get-still a small price to pay for pretty dang good pizza."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for delivery and was hung up on. After ordering I asked what comes on their club, the man on the phone told me to hold on, then yelled at someone in Spanish for 2 minutes into the receiver. When he came back I again asked what was on the club and he asked \"are you going to order, because I have other customers\", I said I realize this, all I would like to know is what comes on your club. Then he hung up on me. I called back and it went to voice mail... Shame on them."}
{"text":"Firstly I have to say I saw all of the negative reviews and decided I wanted to try it anyway. Sadly the reviews weren't wrong. Here are the things that determined my review: 

- they decided to give me a random soda since they didn't have the one I ordered instead of giving me a call or letting me know they did not have it when I called to place the order.
- the soda was warm so when it arrived I could not drink it (I could have but warm soda...just no)
- the pizza was extremely greasy
- the pizza fell apart before I could eat it because it was soggy and greasy

There really was not anything that impressed me about this place."}
{"text":"OK I GET YOU WANT ME TO TRY YOUR PIZZA. I don't need your flyer taped on my door with scotch tape 20 times a month. It pulls the paint off the door on hot days too. So thanks for the property damage, and you won't be getting me as a customer."}
{"text":"I love redline pizza. I have ordered pizza and wings twice. I also have picked up pizza multiple times. First lets start with the delivery. Both times was told 20 minutes and I was sceptical. Pizza hut always tells me any where between 30 to a hour. My last experience with them they told me a hour and 30 minutes. I could read a book teaching me to make pizza and still make a pizza in 90 minutes. Redline from the time I hung up was at my door in just under 19 minutes. Every time pick it up its ready just as fast. The are fast serve a good product and have great prices."}
{"text":"Horrible disappointment. Would not order again. Took an hour and a half for a 40 minute delivery. Ordered the gyro and a Greek salad. The gyro had one skimpy slice of meat and the sauce was nothing but watered down ranch. The salad was mediocre at best. They delivered to my hotel with no napkins and not even a fork for the salad. Had to eat it with my fingers. Total waste of money. Has the usual delivery charge which is no big deal but then they charge you a fee to order online. What a crock of shit."}
{"text":"We got a flyer on our door for this pizza place thought we give it a try we got the 20/20 deal and when my husband picked it up and brought it home it was really bad. There was a lot of grease and when you tried to grab a slice all the cheese came off of the whole pie at once and the wings were very rubbery. Called the store and talked to the manager to get our money back he asked how much was eaten and I told him not much a couple of bites and he said I will give you half because it was eaten and I said I want all my money back and he said I want all my pizza back then hung up when I saked for a corporate number. So we had to drive back down and demand for my money back he said ill reverse the charge tonight when we closed I told him I wanted it reverse now then when my husband told him we wanted it back now he then reverse the charge. So be warned dont go here if you want nasty pizza and horriable customer service I wish I could give it no star"}

Actual Delivery 8:21 pm 
  
I ordered 2 items that cost me $16.00 including delivery and tax.

Customer Service (Phone) - 3.00 -  Typically, restaurants ask you if you want everything that is included on your sub. The person who answered the phone did not do that.
 
Delivery - 4.00 - This place is located 10 mins away from my house. They can try to be more transparent about the delivery charge by listing it on the flyer.

Food 

Philly Cheese Steak Sub - 2.00 - Philly Cheese Steak Subs are made with cheese wiz. Calling a \"cheese steak sub\" a \"Philly cheese Steak\" is misleading (Sorry, I'm from the east coast). If you get the cheese steak sub, then be sure to let them know if you would like lettuce, tomato, and mayo on your sub because it does not come with those items.  This sub does come with sautéed onions, red and yellow bell peppers, and provolone cheese. This sub was plain.

Greek Salad  4.00  This was a nice and fresh Greek salad.

{"text":"so gross Pizza cheaper quality, greasy  Pizza, wings was so dry and no flavor... don't try , any place is better then this...."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered an large pizza and wings, Off of grub hub. Was super easy and they sent out a text saying my order will be around this time. And it gave me an estimate. Was really nice to know wen it would be there but what's funny is it was early! Which was even better. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Rude people.  Staff seemed way to young and inexperienced  to make a proper pizza, wings were swimming in grease. I would rather go to pizza hut or hungry howies way better customer service and food at about the same price if not cheaper? This place seems to use low quality ingredients very cheap cheese and tasteless sauce."}
{"text":"Redline left a flyer on our door a year ago and we just sort of stuck it in our flyer drawer and left it at that.  We finally decided to try a different pizza place since we order from Dominoes, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Hungry Howie's, Buono's, Rosati's, and Barros most often.  We love to do pizza and wings at least once a month.  The problem we run into is the wings.  Either they are dried out, cheap quality, or just not satisfying.

What drew us to try Redline were their prices.  We took advantage of 2 pizzas, wings, and a 2 liter.  The pizzas looked good but once you took a bite the looking good turned into the question of what am I eating.  The pizza lacked sauce, overwhelming yeast flavor and the ingredients were of low quality.  One pizza was sausage and mushroom and the sausage was flavorless.  The other pizza was ham and pineapple.  The pineapple was clearly canned but had no flavor and the pieces that did have flavor tasted liked they were really old.  The ham was also of cheap quality like the stuff you buy in the grocer that sells the do it yourself pizza kits.  The wings were dry and tough and not meaty.  

If cheap is what you are going for then expect cheap food court in the mall quality.  That is what you are going to get.  The flyer that we got as well as 90% of our meal and our $33 bucks before tip went into the trash.  One of our members in our household who will eat just about anything was the first to say how bad our experience was.  Better off getting a frozen pizza or ordering from another place."}
{"text":"We love Redline Pizza. The pizza is always pretty good! My family loves the wings and the sauce is finger lickin good. $6.99 for a XL carry out is a pretty good deal."}

{"text":"I normally don't pay much attention to the flyers left on my door, but my kids twisted my arm because they wanted pizza.

I looked at the prices listed, and they were pretty comparable to the big boys, so I gave it a shot.

I am glad I did.  This pizza was excellent.  I couldn't really describe it, but my friend who ate the pizza with me the last time we ordered said \"It reminds me of home, that one little pizza shop around the corner back in PA.  This is some good stuff.\"  

The people are really friendly.  They are always willing to talk, and treat each customer well.  At any point I have been in there, they are always chatting with the customers, making sure they are taken care of.  Not like the big guys in this neighborhood that hide behind glass windows and avoid customers like the plauge.

This place is also very clean - on the 3 occassions I have walked in, the floor was swept, and the employees were wearing gloves to top the pizzas.

I am a big fan of supporting the mom and pop shops - and let me tell you - I will support this one for as long as I am in the area.  I do have to warn you, when the pizza is not excellent - it is still pretty good - but it is a mom and pop shop, so sometimes the pizza isnt as good as the last time.  I really consider that part of the charm.  This isn't your typical assembly line pizza."}

{"text":"Utter bullshit.  I was quoted a price, luckily I checked my bill, and was over charged by $10.  Told the drive I don't want it.  She called to speak to her manager, he said he took the order (he didn't) and that's the price he told me (again, he didn't).  Told me he's charging my credit card anyways and I can take it up with the police.  Beware this shady place!"}

{"text":"They post a menu and special prices for pick up but then tells you when you call that you cant pick it up, that the menu left on your door is fake and that you have to now xall a third party delivery company for much more and their prices that you were quoted are now null and void"}
{"text":"Not sure if I can review without ordering, but just got their flyer and it's all obvious stock photos of food. No thanks. I even found the stock photos online with a single Google search."}
{"text":"Ate a meatball sub here the other day, and enjoyed it a lot. It was enormous, so I had some to take home and my girlfriend gobbled up the innards (since she's doing some lo-carb no bread thing). She loved it. I mean, for the price, it's a ton of food... and the food is good. 

This place has been here for years now, and it's family run. I am a little picky about where I eat - if a place isn't clean or smells funny or whatever, I'll turn around and leave. But this place is clean and you can see the kitchen when you walk in. I live just outside their delivery area I think or I would order from them regularly. 

The food is better than some big mega chain, and the prices are better too. The decor is a little divey and it's not going to win any style awards for decoration (though I do think their logo is pretty cool), but for a low-cost delivery or takeout pizza or sandwich, it's a great alternative to a Domino Hut sort of thing. 

I always eat local when I can. This place earns the seal of approval from me."}
{"text":"I think the door was locked as I approached? Ordered online for an extra $1.25 charge? Waited 10 of the 15-20 Before I walked over to the store. The guy told me they just got the order five minutes ago and it would be another seven minutes. Got the pizza back home and realized I should've saved the $12.35 and just ate the Totino's party pizza that was in my freezer. Little Caesars would've been better."}

The pizza was not better than. I would rate this pizza between Costco and Little Caesars with Costco being the better of the 3. I was mixed because of the reviews, but decided to try it out anyways. I think the review requires tasting the food, and not bail out just because service was not to their acceptability... Anyways.

My All-Time favorite pizza is still NELLO's..."}

The food got to my house fairly quick (about 20 minutes.) The problem I have with this place is that the pizza was TERRIBLE!! Hardly any toppings, burnt crust, cheese only went half way out from the center, and just very bland.   However, the wings were pretty good. Definitely won't get another pizza from here again though."}
{"text":"Got the 5 5 5 deal and had it delivered to the house. Ordered a large one topping pizza, chicken parm sub, and the Italian sub.

They might have only tasted that good though since we were drunk and hungry."}

When I called to ask where my food was, the guy on the phone said they had technical issues. Understandable, but if people are on a lunch break at work, and the delivery time frame was quoted 45 minutes, don't you think it would be appropriate to contact the customer to give them a heads-up on the delay? This guy was not sympathetic to a new customer. Next, I received my food. (Meatball sub & a garden salad). No receipt, no napkins, and no silverware. I needed a fork for my salad! Not a good first impression, RedLine."}

Having said that--let me tell you what we've devoured!

2nd order delivered was more than we expected in a goooooooood way! Ordered 2 foot longs cut into 2 individually wrapped \"meals\" filled with chicken parm( lightly spiced) and the other Phili Cheese Steak. These HUGE Sub/Hoagie/Submarine Sandwiches: EXCELLENT!!!! 
The 3rd was Gyro and they have LAMB!!!  Devoured that and the fries... Couldn't stop till it was GONE...ok, so I had help!!! James Scopa??

{"text":"I have personally called Redline Pizza twice. Every time I was put on hold for way to long. Every time I got frustrated by the excessive wait time. Always hung up before I could give them a chance.

My roommate was able to get them to answer a call and take her order. She ordered a one topping pizza and they never asked her what topping she wanted. The pizza reminded me of little caesars (good tasting cheap pizza).

I have revised this review. But I still think they need to hire better employees."}
