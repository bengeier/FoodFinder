{"text":"We are perplexed by comments of the other reviewers.  We have consistently found products (cheeses, salads, pâté) to be unimaginative, of mediocre quality, and expensive.  The wine selection is nice.  It feels as if the person responsible for product selection has gone for mid-level quality. Nearby Sunsingers is no better."}
{"text":"I love this store, its housewares merchandise, and its wine selection, but I've given up on the convenience of picking up a sandwich there. I haven't had one for a while that isn't on dried-out bread. (No, I don't mean \"crusty\" or \"firm,\" I mean \"dried out.\") Makes me think the sandwiches have been sitting in the cooler for a while."}
{"text":"We took our mom here on Mom's weekend, looking to kill some time. We spent an hour here browsing, buying italian pastas and amazing cheeses. Lots of different things to browse, including clothes, candles, household/kitchen goods, pre-prepared foods and foods waiting for you to cook. I love this place - great addition to Champaign!"}
{"text":"Great food and even greater employees! The employees are so kind and helpful. And the food! Such a amazing selection everyday. My favorites tend to be the daily soup special and the eclairs!"}
{"text":"How lucky for Champaign to have Art Mart now located in the area. The long standing reputation of the store previously located in Lincoln Square is legendary, but they have truly upped their game in the new location. Of specific mention are wonderful deli counter and coffee bar, the beautiful selection of housewares, books, toys, and selection of beers and wine. We are frequent visitors to New York City, and this establishment is on equal grounds with the best of establishments there."}
{"text":"Just walked in this shop looking for hopscotch bakery. They informed of the different items they offer for sale and directed me toward hopscotch! I loved the set up of the art mart and all the different sections. Got a recipe that has a unique ingredient?? They just might have it! I'll be going back here to get a few select food items as gifts for people soon! Also there are wine tastings a few times a week and cute clothing. So glad I found this place!!"}
{"text":"Joy!  Happiness!  I have always loved Art Mart.  I've shopped there for 20+ years in Lincoln Square and could lose myself methodically going up and down the aisles--it was always fun and relaxing to check out the cool stuff they carried.  But let's be honest--I really only went there when I lived in Urbana or after the Farmer's Market on Saturdays when I didn't live in Urbana.  Art Mart has reinvented itself in a beautiful, sunny Champaign location that is convenient to SO many more people.  And in doing so, their inventory is beautifully displayed and has grown quite a bit, to boot!  I attended a fundraiser wine tasting event there a few weeks ago and got my first exposure to the new digs, but it was so crowded that I didn't get to really soak it all in.  Today I ran over for a quick lunch from their cafe and have decided that this is my new happy place.  When you walk in, there is a lovely display of whatever the seasonal or featured merchandise is (Today?  Cool Easter basket stuff--including the actual baskets and Easter grass so you can make your own!)  To your right--china and housewares--the same fantastic quality they have always had with brands like Dansk and Polish Pottery.  To your left is the cafe--but we will come back to that later.  Art Mart has seriously expanded its clothing selection and has enough room to really merchandise the product in a way that draws your eye.  Art Mart Toys lives on at the back of the store and evokes nostalgia of a simpler time when my pre-teen kid was still just a little guy.  They continue to carry the lovely soaps and lotions as well as stationery and anything else quirky and fun.  The gourmet food section is so nice.  The added room makes a huge difference here.  And I have one word for you:  WINE.  Oh baby, that's right.  Check out the wine selection.  Coincidentally enough, it's right by the deli section where you can pick up one or ten different selections of cheese or meats to go along with it--right inside the south-facing door.  Also there in the deli is an AH-MAY-ZING case of pastries that I understand are provided by Hopscotch.  I may or may not have tried a lemon bar this afternoon even though it SO not on my diet....  Don't judge.  But I digress.  The cafe area has a really cool selection of premade sandwiches and side salads (Take note here, foodies--you MUST try the pasta salad with the blue cheese and grapes and green onions--I know, I know.  It sounds weird.  TRUST ME.  Would a chubby chick steer you wrong?) and fresh fruit and all sorts of green salads and various and assorted bottled and canned beverages.  Make your selection and go to the coffee bar to grab some java or a yummy fresh-brewed iced tea and maybe a cup of their freshly made soup.  My sandwich was enough to feed three, and theoretically my side pasta salad should've lasted two meals....but it was REALLY good...plus my iced tea--total was $11.  DEAL.  I sat and enjoyed this in the clean atmosphere with TONS of sunshine soaking in the front windows.  Sunshine was something the old Art Mart never had the luxury to enjoy.  It's nice.  I like it.  I can't comment since I've not used them myself, but did you know that Art Mart caters?  I'm not going to forget that....  I'll be back, Art Mart.  Here is my money.  Please take it away from me.  ;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's terrific for picking up a last-minute gift (food or otherwise), and they have a fabulous grab-and-go section for breakfast, lunch, snacks, etc. They do a nice job with their coffee drinks, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention their croissants and other homemade breakfast treats in the case. Staff are always super friendly and helpful.  Overall, a wonderful and unique place to shop!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Champaign. Sometimes I go there just to walk around and take in how inviting Art Mart is - but I always end up buying something. They have the COOLEST children's items, a fabulous wine selection, entirely too tempting variety of kitchen accessories, and inevitably interesting surprises and gifts. I love their smoked Gouda pasta salad a little too much, honestly.  Update: I had a cortado in their cafe recently, and Art Mart without a doubt has the best coffee in town. One of the few places in town to get espresso made right."}
{"text":"I love Art Mart it is my favorite place for all things food, clothes, deli, toys, you name it! I am so excited about the new space! everything is wonderful and everyone there is wonderful! the employees are so knowledgeable about their work and so enthsiastic I feel so welcome everytime I go. see you soon Art Mart!!!!"}
{"text":"The addition of Art Mart to our South Champaign neighborhood has been awesome!  They have expanded from their former Urbana location. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable, and their selection of gourmet food, including cheese, wine, and Mirabelle breads (they sell out!) is impressive. They also have lots of great, modern kitchen items, a nice coffee and deli/baked goods selection, and women's clothing and toys.  I just wish they had outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"The new art mart is spectacular.  Reminds me of a miniature Harrods of London.  A luxury department store of sorts. Where else can you find children's toys, a bakery, clothing, a deli, wine, housewares, and so much more under one roof? There's nothing here that you really NEED but everything that you WANT.   There is no shopping experience in town that makes you feel this happy. When I'm in the need of a rare item for a recipe this where I look. The other week I needed green peppercorns, art mart was where I found them. On top of quality product, that staff is always nice, knowledgable, and helpful."}
{"text":"If the word \"foodie\" didn't make me gag, I'd use it in this review. This little gem in Champaign is a gourmet's paradise, really. I miss the old location in the now dying mall (though there is a very cool food coop there now). But this is fine. Lots of odd dried and canned products, amazing cheeses, pates, charcuteries, and one of the best, if not most eclectic wine selections (and a wine bar to boot) in town.  Planning a party? Go here."}
{"text":"See my earlier post for cheese and crackers. Left there came here - so glad I did. Remember that pet peeve of mine? Well, the moment I entered Art Marts front door I was greeted by one of their staff and welcomed into their store. They asked if I needed any help finding anything - which I didn't as I was just browsing. Went into a different section and was again greeted by the person behind the counter and asked if I was looking for something special. Again just stated I was browsing and this person said \"please let me know if I can help you with anything\". This is customer service at its best.   I picked up a lot of things which I probably would have gotten at the other place had they even acknowledge that I was there. But now I know where to come to begin with and it's Art Mart. I got some new cheeses,  crackers, olives and a spreadable prosciutto - it will make a lovely board. Oh yes, and a freshly baked ciabatta.   Art Mart is open airy well-organized and welcoming. Decided to skip lunch option and went for a mocha with an almond croissant  - which was delightful!  You just can't beat excellent customer service along with a welcoming environment and fabulous-not- overpriced selection."}
{"text":"I could be here for hours.  They have a wonderful arrangement of businesses.  I was here for lunch with a friend.  We got a couple of sandwiches and desserts.  We were both very happy with our meals.  The only thing we wish is that a hot sandwhich option was available.  Maybe a panini press to heat up the cold sandwhiches.  Otherwise, we were really impressed.  Our desserts were phenomenal.  I think the pricing was also fair."}
{"text":"I love coming here- I always walk away with a great purchase, whether it's food, earrings, toys, a bottle of wine or a dessert. My kids love the toy store and I appreciate the range on toys. Everyone who works there is kind and helpful. I love recommending this place to people."}
{"text":"The same fun place, times at least twice the old space! A much needed and deserved upgrade. Staff was friendly. An excellent time browsing through displays-- though the fun stops at the pricetag.  Hopscotch is worth trying if you've got a mean sweet tooth. The overall space is like Eataly meets IKEA."}
