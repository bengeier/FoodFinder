{"text":"Food is alright it isn't the best.. unfortunately this was the only place that was open as well as a Korean place but we were initially went there for the Chinese food. The hot and sour soup overall it's alright it is spicy so it would have that kick of heat after he high like it is packed with a lot of veggies not something I'm really used to traditional hot and sour soup. Then you have the crispy Cantonese chow mein.. noodles were more chewy than crispy beef was good soft and easy to chew again this is not the regular place that we go to buy our food from the sino Mall the beef though is very tender like that it wasn't tough it wasn't chewy the veggies were also really good at still had that crunch to them but again the only downfall was the noodles were it was just too chewy that you can't even cut with a spoon which normally you can do once the noodles or fried properly and it absorbs that sauce. As for the beef ho fan noodles it was very good it was packed with a lot of flavor same thing with the beef it was soft not chewy I would say that I am definitely not a fan of those big chunks of green onion but I believe that's how they cook this type of this dish where they chop the onions big and it also have regular onions. Not all the onions were cooked completely through  and has a very strong  taste of onions again im not a fan of the onion flavor unless it's cooked properly or cut up small."}

{"text":"This is the place. This is the one true Singapore noodle place that started it all for me, the place where I had my first order of Singapore Noodles back as a small kid.  And not only is it the same flavour, it's just as good as it was back then, which often isn't the case when you go back to places you liked as a kid.  It's decently fast in terms of service, but even if it was slow and an hour wait, it would be worth it.  Now down to the noodles, they're perfect. Done. End of review! Half kidding. They are a bit on the spicier side, so if that's not your thing then I would avoid it. The bits of pork, egg and shrimp are generous, the bits of veggies are not as much, however I think that's how Singapore Noodles should be. It's much more delicious that way, when you're not overwhelmed by veggies.  In terms of saltiness and curry powder, it's great. Which I find is something that really differs from place to place. It's also dry, but not too dry. I really can't stand a wet Singapore Noodle dish, it's just not good. Too dry can be a problem too. But this one is just right.  I'm yet to try the malaysian ho fan noodles, but I'll update as soon as I can try them, as that's another dish I absolutely love from the local Ben Thanh Viet restaurants. Hopefully better too, because I don't want to drive all the way to Burlington for my Malay ho fan."}
