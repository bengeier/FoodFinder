{"text":"Why, why, why have I not eaten here sooner? I guess that I have been spoiled by the presence of all of the great restaurants around us in the East End, but Notion is definitely worth the drive up to Oakmont. 

After looking over the menu, my husband and I decided to do the chef's tasting menu for $85 (I also had the wine pairings for +$30). I STRONGLY suggest doing the same, as the chef's menu is a terrific way to see Racicot flex his culinary muscles, and to try a variety of flavor profiles.

We started with a rose-flavored soda water as the amuse bouche (everyone gets this, obviously, w/ or w/o the tasting menu). The \"carbonation\" was incredibly subtle, and the flavor was sweet without being cloying, thanks to the light texture. It strongly reminded both of us of rose lokum, which was a treat. 

The next three courses were appetizers - the 5'10\" egg, the spring pea soup, and a Thai-flavored shrimp. The egg was a lovely runny consistency, and the white was almost like gelatin. The ramps and mushrooms that came with the egg were a nice taste of Pittsburgh spring. The spring pea soup reminded me of grabbing handfuls of peas fresh from the garden, and the lemon shortbread served in the soup was both sweet and salty, which offset the peas nicely. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and fun to eat with the curry sauce and coconut powder, along with the pungent micro greens.

The two entree courses were both outstanding, but of the two, the fish was the standout (though the meat was perfect as well). The chef reserves the best part of the grey mullet for those who order the tasting menu, and the texture and flavor were really special. The accompaniments to both the fish and the meat complimented the subtle flavors of the centerpiece of the plates, particularly with the use of radishes.

Finally, we finished with two desserts (who can't love a tasting menu with 2 desserts?!). The black sesame sponge that came with the cheesecake gave that dessert a light Japanese tone, and the chocolate dish was like a banana-Nutella crepe kicked up about 100 degrees. 

In addition to the food, the wine pairings were clever and wide ranging. They included a Spanish, French, and Japanese origins (the latter being Hou Hou Shu sparking sake), and each glass really fit the dish or dishes. The sommelier was very knowledgeable, but not at all snobby. The service was also friendly (but not pal-ly), well-informed, and on point all night. It was an amazing dinner, and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth it if you like to eat interesting food in a beautiful atmosphere with perfect service and be entertained by the experience all at the same time. Everything is on what I consider to be the formal side. Personally I prefer a looser, lighter approach but that does not detract from the overall quality of the food and preparations.

Definitely it is best to try as many dishes as possible. Our table shared each entree and appetizer and dessert that came to the table and just loved the combinations and unique flavors. The sous vide preparation on the proteins was very good.

My favorite was the egg and chicken appetizer. Those at the table who had the wine pairings with their selections were quite pleased.

If you don't like to try new foods then don't go here."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh offers many restaurants to get a solid meal but there are very few that can provide a truly memorable evening. This restaurant is an exception. My wife and I recently went for our anniversary dinner. Spent a lot of money but have no regrets. Superb drinks were followed by the chefs tasting menu with wine pairings. Food was remarkably creative and ridiculously tasty. The sommelier was so fun to chat with that we looked forward to each of his trips to explain the pairings. The wait staff was solid. The people that work there seem to truly admire Chef Racicot and with good reason. The restaurant is extraordinary."}
{"text":"Little torn on Notion.  I went with a group of 4 and did the tasting menu.  Each course was definitely very creative and not something you could get at most other restaurants.  In general they were tasty, as well.  However, every single course had this sweetness to it which just became too much after a while.  The flavors just weren't complex enough to justify the price we were paying.  The desserts also did not meet my expectations at all - especially the berry dessert.  Just wasn't good.  It also seems like they don't change their menu much - from what I read in other reviews, it sounds like everyone had the same courses that I did.  Let's say I would only go back if a tasting menu + wine cost me $80-90 instead of $125."}
{"text":"Ate at Notion recently as part of a group of six. Other reviewers have given a blow-by-blow of the food (e.g., the tasting menu) so I won't do the same. This is one of the best dining experiences I have had this year. 

At the risk of sounding pretentious, I've enjoyed accumulating a fair number of Michelin stars this year at various fine-dining restaurants around the world. Notion really is up there with some of the great restaurants in terms of the food. It is inventive, interesting, technical (in a good way), and thoughtful. I also appreciate the chef's talent in balancing inventive \"molecular gastronomy\"-esque preparations (e.g., boeuf en sous vide, an array of foams and gels) and making sure dishes taste great and are satisfying.

A few of us paired wines, and all were nicely picked by the sommelier. He was also a nice guy and was happy to explain the wines, chat a bit, and offer tips for finding the wines in PA with their draconian liquor sales restrictions. Two of us also had cocktails to kick off the dinner and they were great.

Service was above average but a bit hit and miss at times. It may have been the size of our group and our penchant for conversation that threw the servers off their script. We did have to ask a couple of times \"what's this\" to get the full dish descriptions. But that wasn't a big deal. Everyone was friendly. What I hope we don't see is too high a degree of formality creep in over time, because relaxed (but still attentive) service works well at this restaurant.

All in all Notion is great. Despite the drive out to Oakmont I'm sure my wife and I will go frequently because it is just that good."}
{"text":"We just went to Notion last night for the first time, and were wondering why we haven't heard of this place before.  It's phenomenal, and any Pittsburgh foodie worth their salt should be flocking to try this place.  One of the few places in Pittsburgh that I know of that's doing the whole molecular gastronomy thing, other than Nine on Nine, and perhaps, a little bit of Root 174.  I suppose Salt also has a bit of that going on too.

Notion is a bit out of town, but totally worth the drive, if you're coming from central Pittsburgh.  It's located right next to an old school theatre, and the decor is interestingly non-pretentious, given the price point.  We enjoyed the waitstaff, but our group of six almost overwhelmed the restaurant (maybe a little of alcohol was involved...) - I would recommend seating larger parties to the side if possible, just to manage the sound load.

We started with an amuse of a lime foam, which really worked for some of us, and was a little too tart for the rest.  Either way, it was a fascinating opener to a really creative meal.  We had the chef's tasting, and while I can't remember every single course, I'll name some of the highlights - I really loved the beef tartare that was the first course.  It tasted just like home marinated goodness, and I mean that in the best way possible.  They serve it to you in little lettuce cups, so it's like a mini lettuce wrap.  Just fantastic.

Our second course was the english pea soup, which was also phenomenal.  You're first presented with something that looks like custard with some sliced bananas on the side, and then they pour in green pea soup.  The custard stuff is actually some sort of manchego cream, and this was quite possibly my favorite dish of the night.  Totally unexpected, totally creative, and absolutely delicious.  I bet you've never thought of having banana slices with your pea soup.  Well, now you should try it.

We also had a sweet bread risotto, which was an interesting ying yang mix of sweet and salty.  The rib eye was topped with an heirloom tomato foam, which, when combined with the horseradish sauce on the meat, was quite delicious.  My only complaint about this dish is that I wished that the beef had a little more structure to it - it seemed, on its own, a little bland and ... limp.  The salmon was also fine, but seemed the least inspired of all the dishes to me - perfectly done salmon with pickled cucumbers and cream cheese.  

We finished with the blackberry and milk chocolate desserts, both of which were great.  This means a lot, coming from a girl who doesn't really do dessert.

Anyway, needless to say, this was one of the best meals I've had since coming to Pittsburgh, and I absolutely cannot wait to start spreading the word about this place.  Despite my love for many of the restaurants in Pittsburgh, it's a rare place that goes for maximal creative output, and Notion definitely runs at the top of the pack.  We've heard that they are trying to move to a location closer to the city, and hope that this happens soon.  When it happens, we will gladly add it to our line up of go to restaurants for special occasions."}
{"text":"Meh.  Went there last night on my friend's dime.  (Payback for a big favor.)  The food was very good, but the restaurant leaves a bit to be desired, especially at these prices.  

The food was very good, aside from a weird over-use of citrus in several dishes.  

The white asparagus with white chocolate and fish roe sounds weird, but those flavors actually work well with each other.  Unfortunately, there were grapefruit pieces and grapefruit gel thrown in that distracted from the other, more subtle flavors.  My friend's blue shrimp was good for the first bite, but you really, really get tired of the coconut dust by the time you finish the first rather chewy shrimp.  

I'll recommend the 5' 10\" egg: soft-boiled egg with ramps and mushrooms and some heavenly croutons.  (This is big.  I usually hate runny eggs, but it was perfect with the croutons and mushrooms.)  The desserts are good, too.  I had the strawberry cheesecake (nice combination of fresh and freeze-dried, and my friend had the chocolate hazelnut (i.e. Nutella) cake.  I'd give the chocolate cake a slight edge, as long as you scrape the dabs of orange gel off.  (They're already using banana creme, so the addition of the orange didn't help and sort of clashed with the other earthier flavors.)  

The mixed drinks were excellent, too.  Same interesting experimentation with them as with the food, but better execution with the drinks.

I will highly, highly recommend the ribeye, too.  It was heavenly.  My friend's wreckfish was good, but not great.  

The biggest downsides were outside of the food.  My friend doesn't eat red meat or poultry, and there's no veggie option on the menu, which seems a bit odd for an pricier, \"foodie\" place.  I look down my nose at her, too, but you could at least accommodate her with a potato or beets or something.  We asked about the tasting menu, and the meat thing wound up being an issue, because the waiter said the chef couldn't substitute on such a busy night.  Several issues with this: 1.) He didn't even go ask, or even pretend to go ask, if the chef could accommodate us.  2.) It's the tasting menu.  It's supposed to highlight the chef's talent.  If he can't improvise, he's a cook.  3.) Again, seriously?  You can't serve a veggie/fish appetizer instead?  Vegetarians are usually fairly forgiving, and I doubt she's the first or the last who will walk through their doors.  4.) The restaurant was only about 60-70% full when we left.  Busy, but not at full capacity.  5.) Besides, at this price point, the restaurant is never \"full\", even when every seat is filled.  It doesn't matter how many people are there; each table gets the same undivided attention they would get as if the place was nearly empty.  You certainly don't announce to diners that they're not going to get as much attention as if they'd come on another night.

It was also annoying that we had to ask to see the wine list before the meal came out.  I'm really hoping they didn't think we were going to stick with a Sazerac and a berry mojito with our steak and fish.  Then, it was the waiter and not the sommelier who took the wine order, and, when the sommelier did come out, he poured the wine without the usual taste up front.  (I'd probably have changed my order.  The syrah I ordered was a bit more astringent than I was expecting; didn't work well with the ribeye.)

We also inquired about a flavor in the rose soda that came out before the meal.  It was good, but we were curious and asked the waiter.  He guessed it was tarragon and said he'd check, but he never came back to us on it.

The party next to us (slightly too close, as other reviewers noted) had the tasting menu.  From what I could tell, it was just small portions of the regular menu.  Call me crazy, but the tasting menus I've had before were about half off the regular menu and half not - experiments or specials from the chef.

Four stars for food.  Knock off another for the business.  I think there's real potential here, but they need to make a few tweaks to get there.  (I am genuinely glad to see someone trying to do this in Pittsburgh, but I'm not giving five stars for hope.)"}
{"text":"Coming back home after trips to Paris and New York, Chef Racicot brings world class flavor home to Pittsburgh. Notion delivers amazing food, tasty, visual, sensual. There is true art to both flavor and presentation. It is incredibly incredibly underpriced for what it would run in New York, Vegas, or Paris. To this end, Pittsburghers can enjoy world class flavor on a middle class budget. 

A few comments: 
You come for the food. The service is homely and kind, perhaps undertrained in the elements of haute cuisine, but perhaps if they did appear to be too trained, they would scare away local customers! Our server was a bit too eager, a faux pas perhaps in high end service. That said, he always made up for it, realizing mistakes and making them better. 

The decor is obviously from Ikea, and could do with some local art for sale, which would draw other crowds perhaps. This comes with time, of course. 

Some things on the menu are perhaps misleading. (Foie gras  in the duck dish could be marked as a terrine instead, I thought I was going to get the creamy goodness of a paté.) That said, the deliciousness of the prime rib was completely unexpected and made the hairs on my neck stand up (like the time I had truffled mashed potatoes and pigeon stuffed with foie gras at Robuchon's place in Paris). I am happy to know food can do that in Pittsburgh. 

Lastly, while the wine selections could include more South American options, the cocktails are KILLER. High five for the juleps and other American cocktails. Bringing class back into our lives. 

All in all, best restaurant experience I had in Pittsburgh yet. Sadly, I have to leave soon!"}
{"text":"visited again for my second tasting. Service was again flawless, new inventive dishes. Great taste, great experience, great value. 

full review of the entire tasting on my site."}
{"text":"This is a very unique experience. I cannot think of any other
restaurant I have been to in the Pittsburgh area that is as creative,
as perfectionist, and as exploratory as Notion (and I tend to try
upscale restaurants when I have the time). Just on these grounds,
Notion stands strong. The food was overall very innovative, artsy, and
delicious. Some parts of the dishes were hit and miss, but overall it
is a unique and enjoyable experience. We will go back again.

To summarize, pros:
+ Very innovative and exploratory dishes
+ Food is presented as art 
+ Romantic interiors
+ Reasonably sized portions

Cons:
- Expensive (but you should expect this if you are going there)
- Tables are too close to each other

The food is innovative and exploratory... We had four appetizers, one
main course, and a bottle of wine. The appetizers were varied: the
cauliflower with lobster, wild rice with escargot, shrimp with
dehydrated coconuts, and scallops. My gf got the cod. We also got a
bonus chocolate+onion+maple soup at the beginning. All dishes were
delicious, for the most part. Each had a touch of art in it, be it in
presentation, serving, or in the selection of ingredients. The
combination of ingredients in the cauliflower was almost perfect:
cauliflower, lobster, a nicely-designed shrimp cracker, all topped
with a delicious coconut soup (see uploaded picture). My girlfriend's
favorite was the entree, the cod. We also quite enjoyed the wild rice
with escargot. Shrimp and scallpos were also very artsy; dehydrated
coconuts, basil seeds, lemon gels, ... Sometimes we were not sure what
we were eating and not everything was as tasty in a dish, but that was
part of the experience.

The portions we had were quite filling. One should not be expecting
huge portions when going to such a restaurant like Notion. 

Downsides... I felt the tables were too close to each other. This was
not a problem for us since the restaurant was not crowded when we
went, but I can see this being an issue when the restaurant is running
at its peak. 

Overall, Notion provides a unique experience. Food is treated as art
there. It is definitely worth trying, but make sure you have the right
mindset before you get there: enjoy innovation, treat food as art, and
be open to different combinations of food items; and also do not
expect to have three meals' worth of food for the amount of money you
are paying...

Me thinks we need more restaurants like Notion in the Pittsburgh area."}

{"text":"Get ready Notion, this is your lowest rating yet...

Strange array of flavors at times and many times the flavors didn't come together.  We did the 85.00 per person tasting menu and there were a few dishes we didn't even finish.  The meat was way too rare on one dish, the sauce on the dessert way too sweet, and the \"flavor\" lavender should remain in bed sheet fresheners and perfume.  The \"bird's nest\" dish made us feel like we were eating in the wild as the twigs on the dish were a bit too much.  

The sad thing is that I am sure it took meticulous effort to make everything and unfortunately this was not highlighted at all.  I practically had to PULL the information out of the waiter about how things were prepared and even then it was a one-liner.  

Sorry Notion, but your molecular gastronomy \"masterpieces\" went to waste on me."}
{"text":"Well, I'm late to the party in reviewing this fantastic restaurant (see Andy S and Rosalind C, both of whom I dined with last night). I read over their reviews and they are mostly spot on.  Rather than re-write their reviews, I'll just point out a couple of places where I disagreed or just want to elaborate on.

- I think the rib eye was excellent. Yes, maybe not the most flavorful meat on its own, but I think the point was to avoid the meat overpowering the other flavors on the plate. Maybe I'm wrong, but it really worked for me. 
- I agree with Rosalind that the amuse was a great way to start the meal, even if, as she said, some of the other members of our party found it a bit too tart. It made for a beautiful pallet cleanser (the whole point) and really got my appetite up.
- One thing left out of the other reviews is that the portion sizes were perfect. When we started our 7 course culinary adventure (and it really was an adventure) I was ready to loosen my belt and get that \"it was great, but way too much\" feeling. Thankfully, that was not the case. The portions were just the right size to end the meal feeling full, but not overly so. Nicely done!
- As for the service, yes, we may have tripped them up a bit, but I don't think it detracted from the meal at all. If anything, it endeared the waitstaff to our table. 
- The ambiance may have been my only concern. The table we were at was dead in the middle of the rather small restaurant, and I'm sorry to say that we were those annoying guests who were just a bit too loud (there were 6 of us and there was a good bit of wine). But really, that's only because everyone else dining in the restaurant was nearly silent and the acoustics carried our voices farther than they should have. Perhaps a bit of thought to sound dampening would serve the restaurant well.

In sum, whenever the chef moves his operation to Pittsburgh, he will absolutely blow the 'burgh food scene out of the water. If this restaurant doesn't make it to the top 5 in Pittsburgh, someone needs to seriously re-calibrate their scales. And, without doubt, Notion should be awarded best new restaurant in town.

So, my advice. Go to Notion. Get the chef's tasting. Get the wine pairing. Enjoy. You'll thank me* later.
