{"text":"In a crappy area but the store was clean when I went inside. They have a sign on the bathroom door to buy something first before using it lol I ordered the cheeseburger and it was good. Big portion for the amount you pay. Cashiers are nice. I'd go here again since it's cheap and good was just didn't liked the area. Really great fries though!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was the first time in here for me. The first thing one will notice is the 50's music and decor. Which is cool. I ordered their 2 chili cheese dog combo. It was not the best in the world. I guess that, I was expecting more for $11.46 than greasy spoon food. 
 I'll try something else at a later date. Not ready to disavow this place yet. Maybe the food will be better and the girl behind the counter will have a better attitude."}
{"text":"The best food you can get they care about their customers and are fantastic better than the other locations I have been too. I am so glad this one opened near my house I love their onion rings and the zucchini is awesome the mushroom garlic burger was fantastic can't wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"First time here and they had the worst customer service. All of the employees were rude. I ordered a buffalo ranch crispy chicken sandwich and I literally got two chicken strips in the burger and no buffalo sauce. We took it back to the girl in cashier and let her know and the cook that I didn't get any buffalo sauce it was just two strips of chicken just plain. And they said , oh that's how it's suppose to be cooked. Then they just gave me a side of the buffalo sauce... anyways it just seemed like no one was willing to helpful or nice. Last time I go there."}
{"text":"No, No, No. Got there at 10 am when they opened and being my first time I went inside to check it out. Interesting decor. Ordered a cheeseburger and bowl of chili. Staff brought out food. Chili was microwaved because it was hot and cold at different places and spoonfuls. I opened burger and looked at it. I could tell something was wrong just by looking at it. It was ice cold. For being the first person in there, the burger only took 2 minutes to make. Mistake and alarms going off inside my head. I took the burger back and tgey made me a new one. I ate it but wasn't satisfied. Reviews are very misleading. Wendy's makes a better and less expensive burger. Sorry 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"i just ordered a bowl of chilli, it was cold and the crackers_were stale
lennys used to be great! the lennys on 15th ave cmlbck back in the days
when my friend derek worked there. i rec. the burger shop those are bomb burgers and buy 1get 1 free!!!!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to love it, I really did. I do NOT. Food was cold. I ordered a tuna melt. It was ice cold. Burgers were cold. Fries, cold. I guess if prices weren't sky high it would be fine, but for $35 for 3 people and more than half the food was not edible it sucks. 
I won't return, I can't throw money away like that. Please beware. I should have read Yelp before heading in. Let my failure be your savings. 
The pic I've included is to show the cold unmelted cheese on toast of a TUNA MELT."}
{"text":"This is an update for my experience here at Lenny's. I ordered the patty melt combo and ol'boy was it good. They brought it to my table and the seasoned fries were crisp and hot. The patty melt was hot and probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Lenny's used to be the best in town for a grate price the service was always grate  now with all the other burger place around Lenny's is not all the grate anymore the food has gone down hill for sometime now the price are just as much as any of the fancy place but not as good now the service is slow or just rude wake up Lenny what's going on I'll still go because it's bye my job"}
{"text":"My drive thur experience was great Nicole waiting on me at the window she was absolutely great and has such a sweet Spirit about her I got the 2 hot dogs today with chili and french fries and drink which is a great special for less than 7 Bucks and All was really fresh and good"}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of Lenny's. Really glad that this one opened up close by. Every time I get my burger it comes out good. Sometimes during lunch or dinner hours drive thru could be a 15 min wait. Price is pretty high compared to most \"fast food\" joints. Could just to to an actual restaurant for a burger for around the same price. One thing you have to try is the malts, definately pricey but come during happy hour which is like 1-2pm til 5pm (I think). Price is cheaper. But overall I highly suggest trying it out for yourself. 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"I had tried this location (27th/Indian School) shortly after they opened. To be honest I had never tried Lenny's before and was anxious to finally get my hands on what everyone said were great burgers. My first visit was through the drive-thru. I ordered the #1 and took it home. Since I live at least 20 minutes away, by the time I got home everything was cold. Needless to say I was disappointed, but not the restaurants fault, or at least I thought. 

Today the girls and I visited and ate in. We ordered the #1 combo and the fish  sandwich. Before I get to the bad part, I will say the fries were great as are the drinks. The burgers and fish are another story. HOW can you absolutely ruin a burger!!! Well this Lenny's found a way. The burger was tasteless, the bun was cold and fell apart. Even adding mustard didn't add any flavor. No ZING, no ZAP, nada. What a disappointment. I didn't try the fish sandwich, but my friend said it was very greasy and had too much breading. 

Now for the atmosphere. Beautiful and clean inside, but being at 27th/Indian School I wasn't surprised that the whole time we were eating there a homeless man with all his belongings sound asleep in a booth close by. As we were leaving a group of homeless were refilling their CircleK cups (yes Polar Cups) with water....where is the manager? 

Alas, my second trip was also a bust."}
{"text":"Their burgers are the BOMB!! They have only been open for 3 weeks and I've been here twice! Service is super friendly. The fries are great too!! Mexican Burger!!!"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences here previously but it seems to be going down hill fast. Placing our order was a slow and tedious process due to having to repeat our order requests numerous times for the cashier to understand.  Fourty-four dollars later our order is in the system. 20 minutes later our food is delivered missing some items, others incorrect. I ordered fried zucchini and was not told that to get ranch that would have to be ordered separately. Going back up to the counter to try and get my order straightened out I asked also for ranch dressing. I was told that would cost me more. Taking into consideration the fact I am still waiting for my $44 order to be filled properly I would think that ranch dressing would be provided for no charge, just shows how wrong a person can be. The girl at the counter stated the sauce would still need to be paid for as it wasn't her fault the cook messed up my order.   I have to say this was a perfect example in poor customer service.
And no veteran discount also hurts the wallet.."}
{"text":"Do not go through drive thru. Either the order I place is made incorrectly or I don't receive my full order, every time I have come. And despite the receipt stapled to the bag bring the only thing correct, the incompetence to place and fill easy orders just escapes me. The worst part is the food I received tasted old and unsatisfactory. Please fix this"}
{"text":"This place is okay. they have good food, as long as you know it's still in the fast food genre. The food is cook to order, however, it's still the greasy food that you would find at another fast food place. I recommend it for hose who understand what they are getting. The cashier Jayden is there almost every time I come here on my luch. He is excellent & connects to customers using humor. All in all, it's a good spot to grab lunch !"}
{"text":"Just had an unbelievably bad experience here. I love Lenny's burgers and usually end up here four or five times a month as it is handy to my office. Today I missed lunch so I drove over later to get a burger. Walked in and order the burger. The girl at the counter rang it up for the wrong amount. When I pointed it out she immediately became rude, said I'll give you the 30 cents, actually that was wrong also as it should have been more than that, and stormed off to the back.  At this point I just asked for my money back. It took at least five minutes for that. She continued to be mouthy and said \"why don't you just take your burger\". I said no and finally got my money back got in the car and went to McDonald's. 

I am giving one star because you can't give zero. 

Too bad I really am a fan of the burgers."}
{"text":"Wow ... what a disappointment. Someone spent quite a bit of money to fancy up this location from the previous restaurant. Neon lights, stainless steel 50's look and a lot of fun theme stuff hanging on the walls.

Remember going to the Lenny's on Cave Creek next to the Red Onion back in the early 90's. The burgers were really good and they actually delivered them to my apartment. Not sure if this is the same Lennys dude as before. It almost seems like it could maybe be his sister's nephew's second cousin's roommate.

The food is a lot different than before. This particular location is more of a chain style restaurant. You definitely get a lot of food per square inch for the money. Just not the kind of quality food that makes me want to come back for more.

Ordered a Chili Cheese Dog and a Triple Cheese Burger and ate inside. Service was friendly and the place was relatively clean. Received my food and was amazed at how poorly it tasted. The burger seemed kinda smashed. I mean the bun and not the burger meat. Just lacked any type of flavor in general. The Hot Dog was not much better.

Sorry Lenny or whoever you are these days. I'll spend a little more money next time and go for the real McCoy. Give them a try and see what you think. Hear each location can be different. BURP!

2.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Burger Fact: During WWI, the US Government tried to rename hamburgers as, \"liberty sandwiches.\"

We came here for lunch the other day. I had #2 Double Burger with onion rings as my side. The wife got a Sourdough Ranch Burger with fried zucchini. We also split a cup of chili. As others have already stated, the burgers badly needs some seasoning. A little salt, a little pepper, and that burger would have been great. I normally like my onion rings cooked differently so the wife ate quite a few of these. It's okay though. I stole half of her fried zucchini much to her dismay. As for the chili, it wasn't bad. I could appreciate having some chili on top of some fries.

Lenny's was pretty good and they hit the spot. The staff were friendly and they didn't stop working whether they were running food to people or cleaning the tables and floors. There's a passcode for the bathrooms by the way. I hope they season their burgers during our next visit because the quality of the food is definitely there."}
{"text":"Price point for food and service is way too high.   Will go to a gourmet hamburger place next time for the same price without the attitude of the young lady working at the counter."}
{"text":"I followed up with Lenny's Burger Shop and spoke with a manager by the name of Gina. I don't know if she was embarrassed or frustrated with speaking to me about my \"wet burger\". She asked if I had a receipt, I said I did, and we exchanged names. After she learned that I had a receipt, she seemed a little friendlier, and told me next time I was in the area to stop by and they would remake the sandwich. 

Today, I just stopped by to pick up our remake burger, and to order more burgers for the office. We had a huge runaround from the employees who said Gina \" didn't tell them anything.\" And even after showing them my receipt, with Gina's name on it, they told me I could only get my remake during Gina's hours, but then couldn't tell me when Gina would be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it was local however it was a total flop, I got the Mexican burger ( hamburger with a green chili, I think grilled onions and some kind of slimy cheese. I chose to get the combo which was over 9 dollars which by what I got was overpriced, the meat was overcooked and was really bland no flavor with a bun that was much larger than the patty and was really dry and fell apart, down and dirty the place was cute and the fries were good (thus the 2 stars ) however the burgers totally disappointed us I have to say this place was a one hit wonder."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! My order was completly wrong, the girl at the counter had not idea of the menu items. When I placed my order for 2 pastrami hamburgers the kid in the back (the cook) was annoyed and tried to say they were out of pastrami while the other cook said they had plenty. It turned out he didnt want to dirty the grill he just cleaned. As if I wasnt standing there the girl taking my order laughed and told the cook he had to keep cooking as long as they were open. He then stood there cooking my pastrami and pounding it non stop with a knife, it was so lound that the girl at the register told him to stop, he then turned and said he had to chop the pastrami and continued banging that knife onto the grill. When my order was complete, I realized it was just the pastrami sandwiches, I ordered the pastrami HAMBURGERS....I told the girl at the counter that my order was wrong and she just said sorry bout that and walked away. For being a GRAND OPENING I would have thought service would be at its best! Never will return....very bad first impression."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had!!  Great decor & atmosphere! Reasonably priced. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers hands down! Very clean store. Service is top notch. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! We were a little hesitant on giving the place a try due to the reviews but we decided to try It out for ourselves and make a decision.  We were happy with our experience, we went thru the drive-thru and had great service and our French fries and hamburgers were hot and delicious..will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Lenny's for the first time and there was some hits and misses. I understand this establishment just opened and we went around 9:00 pm tonight (they open until 11)  so here's my opinion. 

Let me just say, whoever designed the restaurant did a wonderful job, because once we walked in it was very bright and comfy! Felt like I was in one of the old fashion burger places! We were in awe of the colorful led lights that caught our attention, so A+ on design. 

As we were getting ready to order we were confused as to which way the line went lol, there were people pouring in from the left and the right. I do wish they would establish a sort of line so people knew which direction to order, to prevent line cutting. The young girl that took our order was nice but also not quite knowledgeable in her skills yet. I understand the restaurant is very new, but these skills should have already been trained before opening. We had to wait while she paused and confirm our order. In time I hope this improves! A major difficulty I had oddly was the fountain drink lids. For some reason the lids to the drinks were a tad bit too big and was awkwardly loose around the cup. So please be careful carrying your drink to your seat and giving this to your kids to hold on to. Everything thing else as far as table and trash were spotless and clean. 


Now let's get down and dirty on the food. I got the garlic mushroom Swiss burger, a medium drink, my husband got the hatch green Chile cheeseburger combo.  Both burgers were a good size coming out. The fries were absolutely delicious, thick cut and crispy. My burger tasted fresh but I felt the patty was a bit under seasoned. My husband says he enjoyed his burger but only wished that the hatch Chile was spicy instead of bland to mild in spice.

Overall we do plan on trying other items on the menu and would come back. I do hope the customer service is smoother in the future when we come back. We spent about $18 on our meal. 

Please do check out this spot and see what you think! I don't dislike the restaurant I'm gonna wait to give this restaurant some more time to get in their rhythm because I do believe with the right customer service and quality of food this could be a nice addition to our growing community"}
{"text":"Love love love! They are not stingy on their jalapeños! I recommend chili cheese fries with jalapeños and the mex burger!!! I've only been through drive through but this is better than any commercial fast food! (:"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming burgers for a burger place. I got the cowboy burger and the meats just bland. The kids got chicken tenders which were good, the husband liked the Rueben but I wouldn't go back, especially with how expensive it is for mediocre food. The lids were falling off the cups and one cup had soda all down the sides, we also didn't get straws. The girl in the drive thru was short tempered and rude."}
{"text":"Was super excited to visit this place because I had heard many good things. But, I really feel like it was way over priced for what you get. We had 3 of the lil lenny' s and an order of chilli  cheese fries. The lettuce was probably the only good thing on the burgers. The tomatoes were mushy and grainy, the burger patty was over cooked and dry, the buns were super dry, even got an onion with the skin on it. The chilli was nothing to be excited about. The one good thing I can say is that it's super cute inside but I  also found it odd that you have to be buzzed into the bathroom."}
{"text":"Really clean and great tasting food. I was a first time visitor and ate the mushroom and garlic burger, it tasted really good. My son had the Mexican burger and loved his also. Fries were also very good. We both had dipped cones for dessert. Great meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Super yummy burger! Yelp reviews were accurate! Freshly cut fries and fresh toppings. I would have given them 5 stars but the put sauce on my burger when I requested it without. I will definitely be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"I am updating Lenny's to a one star. Only because their customer service that works drive thru sucks. The girl that helped us name was Rosemary. She was very rude starting from the intercom to the window. First off, we asked if she can hold for a second so we can order our food once we were  ready to order she then said \"well can you hold now\" we agreed. However, she left us on hold for about 3-5 mins . When we were ordering  she was being very rude on the way we were ordering our food. We wanted the ranch burger without the ranch and she laughed and asked \"so what do you want us to put mayo or do you want the junior burger?\" (In a very rude way)  so then we pulled up the window and she took over 5 mins to open the window to take our money .  I asked if we can add an ice cream to our order she laughed at my face and said \"there's no ice cream!!!\" (Really?!) so then she took another 5 mins to give us our drinks by that time the car behind us who had order after had lost their patience and took their service elsewhere. Another 10 mins pass another lady came to the window she had said she just got there I believe her name was grace and said \"I'm so sorry for having you wait for your order) ( the order was already ready but never given to us) she offered us ice cream. Mind you after Rosemary said they're wasn't any to us. She gave us a free ice cream cone for having us  wait in the car the only car there for at least 20 mins + when we were told by her that they didn't have any ice cream. I really loved this place but because of that girl you have working drive thru. You lost my service not only mine but the customer who had order behind us after as well.

Thanks to I believe she said her name was grace I will be going back hopefully we get her and not the other girl because if that happens again all be traveling to a different Lenny's for my food."}
{"text":"I just realized they were open the other day and took a Togo it was awesome so I had to experience it inside sit down this time. The double burger had a great burger to cheese ratio and the chili cheese fries A+"}
{"text":"When you step into Lennys you take a step back on time.  This restaurant is decorated beautifully with attention to cleanliness and detail.  We had the hatch green chili burger and were more than pleased.  Everything was fresh and made to order.  Fries were crispy and hot.  Can't wait to have the opportunity to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I love a good burger so I really wanted to love this new place close to home. It was just ok. The burger was over cooked and had no flavor or seasonings. I think some people think the flavor comes from all the stuff they put on the burger. I love to taste the meat and cheese itself when it is done right. 
I still think this place could turn it around with a few small changes. I hope they do as I will wait a while and try it one more time."}
{"text":"A favorite lunch place! Garlic mushroom burger is my go to. Thanks Jaden for always remembering \"no bun\"!!! Love the fact that they will substitute what you like to make it perfect for you!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in to either get a burger or even just an Ice Cream I'm always greeted with great customer service from Jaden at the counter. Not very often do you get service that cares from most places. 
Plus the food is always perfect for me. Yummy as always! I have no complaints there."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. I found out they had an off-menu Southwest burger with pastrami on it. There was barely any pastrami on it - you could not taste it. A big soggy bun and a giant waste of $8.50. I would give zero stars if I could. Also - - the water out of the Coke machine tasted like a combination of bleach and mold. Hello! Health department - -"}
{"text":"Avoid it if you can.  I bought a $10 order for a family member and I wanted a glass of water with it.   Standard, especially for paying customers.  What's more it is the law in Arizona.  The clerk rudely refused.  Very disappointing. 

The bathroom smells revolting.   It appears clean to the eye but there is a sound of a very unhappy vent fan.

The food was indifferent.   Del Taco was better.  Not like nasty but overpriced for very indifferent."}
{"text":"Loved  the  atmosphere & food was really  good.... however, was very disappointed  to find  out  they don't have lemons  available  as a condiment. Ordered the $9.00 fish & chips only to take it home cuz couldn't  enjoy  it without  lemon!!! Aside from the  lemon issue, everything  else  was great!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there so I tried a cheese burger and a cheese dog.  The cheese dog didn't have hardly any cheese on it.  No celery salt or sport peppers was disapointing.  The cheese burger was good but I don't think I'd return there again."}
{"text":"This place has to be the worst burger joint ever. Somebody spent a whole lot of money to decorate the place, but no money to hire good workers. They employees are very rude and the manager is even worse. One employee even grabbed my phone claiming that she was \"looking at the case\", even if that was so, it was an invasion of personal space. The floors and tables are disgusting. I used to go here everyday after school, and I always bought a shake, but one day I forgot money. I went there to meet my mom, and the manager told me that I either buy something, or get out. Even though I bought something every other time I went there. The employees have a very bad habit of not wearing gloves when they make the food. One male employee made me a shake, and his bare finger got in my whipped cream! It was revolting. The only good thing about this place is their fries, which I'm sure are contaminated too."}
{"text":"This place is so so. Food is so so, services is so so. I've eaten here a couple times since it's open due to its location and I haven't been impressed. First time order got messed up. This time though, the fries were pretty good. Maybe it's the new opening jitters.... well, I hope they get it together and bring their A game"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to Lenny's the burgers. I feel we're not anything amazing for the price."}
{"text":"We love this new Lenny's!  My husband would make appointments around another location on Southern & Stapley so that he could have the Tuna Melt & a Root Beer Float!   My personal favorite is The Hatch Green Cheeseburger!   I have to eat gf & they have the best gf bun I have ever had.  We still live the Lenny's at Stapley & Southern ......However this new location is soooo adorable!   ..... a retro 50's Diner as cute as can be!!! The staff is friendly & it is as clean as a whistle!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a semi fast food burger joint. I call it semi fast food because everything is cooked to order so it takes a little longer than your average fast food chain. They do have a drive-thru but it's still going to take a while to prepare your order. 

This location is in what was once a Wendy's. Totally remodeled interior that looks like a 50's diner, but they left the Wendy's signature sunroom. Very clean and welcoming with tables and nice booths. 

I have been several times and have always had a great burger. Burgers are fresh and have great flavor. You can fix me up however you like. 

Fries are great too, always hot and delicious. 

There are many things I would like to try but I always stick with the classic cheeseburger. Give this place a try!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Beats any other fast food burger place. Yelp wants a longer review so I decided to keep writing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Lenny's however this location is the worst. I ordered ranch bacon fries,  I only got cheese and big pieces of bacon,  nothing like the picture. I ordered a Lil Lenny's meal for my daughter and she didn't get fries or a drink because for whatever reason the cashier heard nothing I ordered. No one is up front when needed the employees are n the back. Waiting to order the cashier seems like she doesn't want to be there and is bothered when we have to order something. We will never come back to this location. I will just keep going to the one on 27th ave and Glendale they are so consistent, and the food taste fresher."}
{"text":"I drive by this place and decided to try it it was worth it friendly staff delicious food the cowboy burger was yummy I would recommend it to anyone who looking for something good to eat"}
{"text":"Went in middle of day on Monday, no line, not busy. Prices were higher than I expected but I thought the food would make up for it. Paid an extra .30 each for 2 ranch dipping sauces, which they never put in the bag so I had to turn around and go back to get, after sitting in drive thru for 10-15 minutes. Fries were good but burgers were thin and on a thick bun so we were full off of the bread. 2 burger combos and 1 kids meal came to $24. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I went to the grand opening in chandler. Ice cream machine was broken they got it fixed at the end of dinner ... I ordered a malt shake, meh wish they actually put the malt in it ,,, but on to dinner, I wish I had a picture, I ordered the Hatch green Chili burger ... after I unwrapped the packaging I had to litterly look for the meat inside, luckily I found the so small patty in between two mushy buns. Along with a dash of wilty lettuce, 1 small slice of a tomato and a small slice of hatch chili... I can't believe I spent what I did on that burger ... I was hoping since they were new they were gonna make sure the food is the best it's gonna be at this moment .. I was sooo wrong Mcdoanlds Artesian Burger were more appetizing than what I got.."}
{"text":"I use to come to this Lenny's often. The manager Gina was fabulous. She went out of her way to make sure customers were happy. After she left service has gone down hill!! I refuse to go inside because the people at the front are rude, so if I do go I use the drive thru, or sit and wait thru. 

I will admit they make a fabulous grilled chicken salad and the fish and chips are very good.

This place just needs better training and better management and they would do fabulous!"}
{"text":"Even a little salt and pepper would really make the burgers immensely better, they are rather under-seasoned. The patties are a decent size. The fries were a bit less crispy than I'd prefer, so be sure to specify that if you get a combo. The shakes are top notch, especially with their half-off sales from 2-4pm. 20+ flavors! The butterscotch is very rich, but right on the mark for taste. They also have floats, which I have yet to try, but they're very tempting."}
{"text":"The Burgers are better than okay, price is reasonable, you get your own drinks.

Since this place is new there is a door opener and security.  The place reminds of a 5 and diner, like back on some old 60's movies.

The staff is nice and are glad to help you out with the menu section."}
{"text":"I ordered a number 7 and my chicken was burnt and lacked flavor. My hubbie ordered pastrami fries with jalopenos and it was missing them. Overall the reasturant was beautiful but the quality of food was McDonald's grade."}
{"text":"There's a rumor I've heard that when Mr. Lenny and Mrs. Lenny got divorced, the result was only one side - rumor said  - Mrs. Lenny -- only her restaurants remained the good ones. 

Now, you can't google \"Mr. & Mrs. Lenny divorce\" so I don't have any idea if that's true but it is a damn good rumor. What I DO know is, it takes a special kind of restaurant to underperform on a burger. This place does that. 

Mediocre, certainly no better than Rally's and Rally's is cheaper.  A double cheese at Del Taco is better. Approximately same money. 

The Lenny's burger was, in fact, warm, but it still tasted old. Ketchup is a condiment but on this Lenny's double, it was the only taste. Maybe an onion, just weak. 

Oh. By the way, try hiring someone friendly. Horrible service. Never again. Never Lenny's burger or mean service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food place to visit. It's adorable on the outside and the food is delicious and they offer so many variations of fast food you are sure To be satisfied.  Today I got the fish and chips and my chips are ranch bacon smothered of course. And they have a amazing selection a wonderful milkshakes."}
{"text":"Wow. Service is beyond horrible for overpriced food that is decent at best. I had to wait a minute before they took my order, even though no one was in front of me in line. I placed my order, and requested different bread- they had to stop for a minute to figure out how to do that and then charge me extra of course. I then ordered fries and a drink in addition to my meal. 

At the window, waited another minute before I paid, then received my meal. When I told them about the extra drink and fries they got angry and told me I wasn't charged for those (even though my receipt said otherwise). Then I only received my fries and when I asked for my drink they made me pull off to the side because there was a line behind me- for a drink. 

They were incredibly rude this entire time and would snap at me every chance they got, making it feel like it was my fault they messed up. I said thank you after getting my food and then immediately questioned why I thanked them. 

If you have plenty of time and I mean PLENTY of time and want to overpay for food that's cold by the time you get it, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We're first timers. Upon entering, the atmosphere was hip n cozy. We were greeted by very friendly staff. Everything looked great on the menu! I opted for the grilled mushroom burger and my husband the Patty melt on rye. My husband doesn't like rye so Nicole suggested Texas toast. Omgeee his was delicious!! Mine was too! Fries were seasoned and light n crunchy. Nicole was very personable and cheerful! We'll definitely be coming back as everything looks yummy on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Burger is a 3 and chili cheese fries 4 maybe? Not too bad for a burger joint. This is not gourmet, so don't come expecting anything fancy.

This place has hot dogs, corn dogs, burgers, fries, sweet fries, chili cheese fries, malts, shakes, ice cream cones, root beer floats and more!!!! 

I will have to come back to try other things. I ordered the regular burger which is combo #1.  My boyfriend got the double patty and chili cheese fries with pastrami. The burgers were alright, but the pastrami on the chili cheese fries were delicious! The jalapeños on top of the pastrami happened to come out super spicy! Everything was made to order, even after fifteen minutes the chili cheese fries were still steaming when you scooped one up! I did wish the fries had more chili beans though. 

Anyways, we'll definitely have to come back to try the ice cream in the summer time!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! So family-friendly Great service and awesome food. The patty melt was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Cali for some years and I was trying to find something similar to Tam's and Louis Burger.  Lenny's is its own thing but is good food for good price. I'll take Lenny's over McDonald's and Burger King. I the seasoning on the French fries are fire! I'll give it a 7 out of 10"}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon burger joint...with an emphasis on \"greasy\". The burgers fall apart in your hands because the buns are sopping wet.  The dining room is clean and bright, decorated to a 1950s style, sort of like 5 and diner.  But the food is in a word... Gross."}
{"text":"We had heard the Lenny's in Phoenix was great so wanted to try new one in Chandler. The decor is very good and fun, so gave two stars, however, the hamburger was pretty tasteless, the bun was actually cold like it just came out of refrigerator, staff seemed clueless about product and unsure about prices, etc. I would save money and just go to in and out which is predictably staffed with well schooled staff, food tastes better and cheaper. Might return to this place for half price shakes."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese and fries are fine. I got a pastrami and I guess I misread the menu because I thought the au jus would be served on the side. Not worth the 14 bucks I paid for it with the combo. The sauce was disgusting and ruined the whole sandwich for me. Thankfully my boyfriend will eat just about anything, but he wouldn't get it again. The Oreo shake was good. He got the pastrami fries and said they are whatever and he wouldn't get them again. I would come back to try a burger."}
{"text":"I really should have read these reviews before going. Just tried it for the first time today. The fries were good but the burger tasted like one of those frozen burgers. Unseasoned and it wasn't cooked all the way. For the price, it really should be better."}
{"text":"Fast. Fresh. Friendly. Fantastic! We came here with high expectations after growing up on the Original Lenny's and let me tell you....we underestimated how great this food would be. Our family favorites taste great and it's now closer to home! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The place itself seems a little tired and is sometimes in need of a clean (table tops), but the staff are friendly and the burgers are ok, I would say the chicken strips are good and the fries above average. A step above 'fast food chains' but not quite enough to move it into the 'lunch date' category."}
{"text":"The bacon cheese fries were good, they use a nacho cheese.  The burger qas seriously mediocre.  Seeing as they had the best burger in 2011 I seriously expected better.  The patty was overly salty, the lettuce barely edible.  Truly almost $10 for a burger, fries and drink...  I was hoping to really enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Tried Lenny's for the first time on a to go basis. Damn good burger!!! Perfectly seasoned burgers and fantastically seasoned HOT fries. Great customer service at the window. Will try indoor service next. Definitely worth stopping in. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to my own preference of red onion on a burger instead of the typical white or yellow, would have been 4.99 stars if available."}
{"text":"Came on Sat. morning and loved the service and food! Burgers are juicy and flavorful, fries crispy, and the atmosphere is amazing. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This location just opened up today (April 26, 2018) and their service is top notch. All of the wall, floor , and ceiling decor is awesome. The General Manager was very personable and chatted with us for a bit. Service was quick - considering the number of people that were here to order and eat. This will definitely be our local burger shop stop."}
{"text":"So...I'm glad I didn't read some of the reviews here before I went today for lunch.  There's a Lenny's on Central, but I hate that parking lot so I've never gone.  Never knew they had another location.
I mentioned today (Saturday) to my coworkers that I was hungry for a good burger and someone mentioned Lenny's.  I had always dismissed it as some local burger knock off.  I'm not sure why.
I went to this location today because it's closer to my house and went through the drive through.  The girl who works the drive thru, Nicole, couldn't have been nicer.  So sweet.
Now for the food......Shut The Front Door!  OMG.  I had the Ranch Burger ( I figured I would try their basic cuz if you can't pull off the basic, then I'm not gonna bother: and substituted onion rings for the fries in my combo.  The onion rings were melt in my mouth delicious and I am so glad Nicole suggest ranch dressing for them.  Heaven!  The Ranch Burger is a little bit of heaven.
I am a fan for life and I can't see going back to more famous hamburger fast food places ever again.
Good job on ya, Lenny's!"}
{"text":"This place needs some serious help. I understand it's right in the middle of ghetto town USA which is why you shouldn't keep me waiting in the drive thru for 19 minutes for a burger and fries! Plus you added onions and forgot my straw! Huge fail. I would never pay you $15 per hour. Today you were worth 3.35. Won't be back to this location ever"}
{"text":"Went to Lenny's tonight for the first time. I have to agree with many of the comments. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The food...not that good. The meat has no flavor, the \"Hatch\" green chilies had no flavor or heat, and the fries were so soggy. The ice cream cones and shakes were very good though. Hopefully they will be able to work the bugs out and the food gets better. We will try again in a couple of months."}
{"text":"Ordered a lil Lenny and onion rings, sat down, after about ten minutes I'm starting to wonder what's taking so long. At this time a couple walks in and orders a bunch off food. I'm still waiting all while the crew is joking and all messing around with someone in the drive through. I can see them eating behind the counter. After another 5 minutes THE COUPLES FOOD IS WALKED OUT, I go to stand up to see what's going on and they walk out with mine.
Worst service, they were all acting like it was recess. Would not recommend. This was on May 14th 2018"}
{"text":"A Phoenix staple has come to Chandler! My husband was so excited to see that a Lenny's opened up close to home! We got two of the classic ranch burgers, fries and onion rings. They were all delicious! The inside has a classic diner feel and was very clean. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and the food was expensive for what it was and really terrible. The staff was friendly and kept us informed of our order. 

The burger had no flavor, the zucchini had flavor - like it was fried in really old oil, the chili tasted like Hormel right out of the can, and the banana shake tasted like medicine.

The staff deserves more like 4 to 5 stars, but the product is so poor. I went back and forth between 1 and 2 stars."}
{"text":"Look, I really did like this place, but it's pricey for a burger spot. 

First up: the ambience. The inside is really cool, it's got that old school diner vibe. Super clean and different. You order at the front counter and then they bring your food out to you. Those working were friendly and definitely on top of keeping tables clean and sweeping up crumbs. 

As for the food, we got a cowboy burger (bbq, bacon, cheese, onion ring) and a double cheese burger plain, with fries and the fried zucchini as a side. If you get a combo you can upgrade to zucchini or onion rings for .50 cents so I figured why not? Ranch (and any sauce beyond ketchup) is .30 cents each. I don't mind but that can add up if you want to try multiple kinds. I just wanted ranch with the zucchini... which I would think would come with one sauce but I digress. 

The burgers were enjoyable. The cowboy is more tangy than sweet bbq but was tasty. I really liked the fries, they are thicker than other places. Fried zucchini was tasty but a lot on top of a burger. I'd maybe order these alone as a snack or stick to fries if I ever came back. 

Much better than generic fast food but the price was a little much for a burger, fries and a drink. Every combo was $10+. Even the basic double cheeseburger with nothing else on it was $10.79 with drink and fries. It's good but not quite sure if it's that good. 

I would return but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. It's worth a shot though if you know it may be a little pricier than other places."}
{"text":"I have not heard of Lenny's burgers and was very excited to have a burger joint in the neighborhood. I tried them as soon as they opened and loved it. Very cool atmosphere. Friendly staff. Owners are spectacular folks and super accommodating. We didn't realize that they had more to offer than burgers so that was a sweet surprise. We ordered a single and double combos with sweet potato and cheese fries. Everything was very tasty and flavorful. Will def come back. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"You know what's one of the saddest things in the world? Under-seasoned food. You heard me. Kiss that ground beef with some salt n peppa and I don't just mean the hip hop group.

The burgers are still decent, the onion rings are great, and the fried zucchini are delicious. I like onion rings that are still juicy inside oppose to the kind that are Arizona-like [AKA burnt to death and dry as if it were kissed by hellfire]. The fried zucchini was insanely poppable and I would get these over and over again. We also got a cup of chili on the side just to give it a try and it's good too. Consistency is a little off though. One or our burgers were cooked well-done and the other had some pink. 

The staff size is huge and they are super courteous and check up on you often. They don't just stand around doing nothing either. Things are constantly being cleaned from the tables and the floors are always being mopped. I do think the quality and service is there. Let's just get some seasoning on those burger patties!  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you took a class of third graders and asked them to run a restaurant this is exactly what you would end up with. Sandwich makers that apparently can't read their order slips. Sent my food back twice the third time they added some hot sauce to it for.. giggles? This is not lennys as a whole but this location is an absolute joke with no sign of competent management or employees."}
{"text":"i've never left a review in my life on anything and i'm not the type of person to get fed up with stuff because i understand why things happen. when i say this was the worst service i've had, you know it's serious. we ordered our two combos (grilled chicken and a ranch burger), all was good. we pay at the window. the cashier, we'll call her karen because she looks like a karen idk, leaves for like 15 minutes and we're sitting in the car waiting. a guy brings a bag to the window and also just leaves it there and walks away. we wait a while longer and the order from the person behind us is also dropped off at the window next to ours. karen finally comes back and gives us our order and tells us to have a nice day (thanks). we trusted everything was ok and was all in there (our fault for trusting it). i get home and i get a \"burger\" with literally a piece of chicken between two buns and some mayo. no lettuce, no tomato, nothing. we check the other burger and it was wrong. we didn't even get the ranch we paid extra for and our food was cold. and there was a hair in my fries. i'm pretty disappointed because we've never had a bad experience at the other lenny's downtown. literally the worst $18 i've spent."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Glendale Ave location.  It is a newer building - thankfully moved from the semi-sleazy building by the high school.  My kids loved the burgers and I would sometimes use the coupon from the football program to get a burger after watching the daughter in the marching band.  The weirs thing was every time I ever ate at Lenny's although the burger was great I would have the wildest nightmares.  Strange since I seldom remember dreams but these were strange.  Once at the old building I was creeped out by some dirty mop water visible.  Well, I have driven past the new building and it looks good, clean and busy so I had the hubby pick up some burgers tonight.  I had the Tasty Burger combo and we split some onion rings.  It was as good as I remember and I am hoping for sweet dreams.  Wish they didn't have Pepsi."}
{"text":"New location opened in an old Wendy's about three months ago. I had the Mexican burger Sweet potato fries and a soda. \"Meh.\" The fries were very good, the burger was not that great and cold in the middle, and the servers were very friendly. I will go back and try another style of burger thinking maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe, I will also try the location on Central too since I hear such rave reviews on that restaurant."}
{"text":"Creative fatty combinations like bacon ranch fries or pastrami chili cheese fries. However the quality isnt there. If your looking for something quick, inexpensive, and dont care about health then grab a burger and fries from here. There is other burger places that are better, including the burger shoppe that is right around the corner from there. Much better."}
