{"text":"Great cannolis. They were filled when ordered so they weren't soggy. I would share a picture but they were all gone before the could! Definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I don't usually do Yelp reviews, but had to do it for this place. I grew up in Unionville and live in the neighborhood. This is a great coffee place if you're into expresso / expresso-based drinks. Also, for those looking for a good place to work for an hour or two, the WiFi is fast and they lots of really nice outdoor seating. If you're on Main Street Unionville, I'd encourage you to check them out."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came to check this place out during our evening walk.  The little shop is a little hard to find but thankfully there is signage pointing you to where it is. 

They have a number of different gelatos available and apparently the shop makes the gelato themselves.  We tried lemon, frutti di bosco (mix of various berries), strawberry and dulce de leche.  The lemon was by far my favourite.  It was the perfect mix of sour and sweet and was super refreshing.  The dulce de leche had a great creamy texture and was super yummy as well.  Unfortunately, there was no pistachio which is generally a gelato favourite.  Not sure if they don't have pistachio in general or they just didn't have any the day we came.  

In addition to gelato, they also have some pastries, coffee, paninis, cookies and donuts.  The donut called \"bombe\"is a donut filled with nutella I believe which sounds delicious.  The only thing was that the donuts were out in the open and there were a number of fruit flies landing on it which really was not appealing.  They really need to put the donuts on a cake stand with a cover or something so as to avoid 1) people coughing/ sneezing on them and 2) bugs. 

Overall, we enjoyed the gelato, customer service was good but the reason I didn't give 5 stars was for the donuts that were out in the open.  This place is a great addition to Main St. Unionville and we'll definitely be back to get some more gelato and maybe their pastries and donuts (if they're covered in a case)."}
{"text":"A neat gelato/sandwiche place that long needed at main street unionville. It offers a variety of home made gelato from fruity to tradional flavors. The cannoli and bombe both worth a try. Dont forget to get a stamp because you will get a free one after 10 purchasea. We definitely need more gelato store in Markham as I am a big fan of kekou on Baldwin street, Toronto. Kekou is still my top pick."}
{"text":"Main Street unionville = ice cream or gelato.

This is by the mill building- good signs to get to it. I Tried the small cup of baccio - $4.50 for a generous serving - which itself gets an extra star!!

I also had a sample of the dulce de leche.

Both were amazing! And the staff was polite."}
{"text":"Oh wow! A new gelato place on Main Street Unionville is a definite must try in my opinion! This one is located at the Mill, so you gotta walk all the way down to the other side! With great hours and a welcoming environment, it is definitely worth a visit!

Came here for dessert with a couple friends after dinner, and it was absolutely a great choice. The staff were super friendly with beautiful smiles and spoke to customers to make them feel at home.

Upon choosing a flavour, it has always been hard for me to pick as they offer so many great options! The great thing is that they let you try a bit of a flavour before you make your final decision! Always a good idea!

They have 3 sizes, and I was surprised how much they put in the cups! Each size can have 2 flavours as well, which is an absolute win! I didn't know this before deciding and got a medium, but they jammed the cups full of gelato! You can definitely just order a small, unless you are craving lots!!!

I got the Mango and Lemon flavours, as I was in a fruity mood, and the 2 made a nice contrast. With sweet and sour, the mango was more sweet, where the lemon was similar to a sorbet! (Which I love!)

They have nice pastries, sandwiches, and coffee as well, so there's lots of reasons to be back soon, at different times of the day! Definitely come check this one out!"}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews, I've been wanting to try this place for a while now.  I finally had the opportunity on a Sunday morning while I was in the area.  (Yes, gelato for breakfast!  I'm a grown up, so I do what I want!)

Was greeted by a very friendly girl minding the store.  She explained that the gelato is made by them off site.

While there isn't a huge selection, they definitely choose quality over quantity!  I got a medium that comes with up to two different flavours.  I had strawberry and chocolate, which complemented each other perfectly.  While the strawberry tasted very fresh, it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked (but it was to be expected since the strawberry gelato is dairy free).  The chocolate was deliciously rich and smooth.  Again, the two flavours worked so well together!

My only con is the price.  As expected, you have to pay for quality.  Two mediums came to about $12.  While I'm so glad I tried this place, it's a bit too much to have regularly for the amount of gelato that comes in the little cup.

Overall, I'm definitely satisfied with my experience.  The gelato was delicious and I'm so glad I was finally able to try it!"}
{"text":"Update of my previous review:

So on my most recent visit I went in with my family to grab a coffee and gelato for the kids.  I was looking forward to the kids enjoying their gelato and getting a great cup of coffee.  We ordered gelato and got chocolate and coconut gelato.  I will say that I rated it a two because of how great the coconut gelato was.  You could taste the real coconut flavours and there was actual coconut mixed in it was awesome.

The chocolate on the other hand compared to the last time was very disappointing as there was a freezer burn taste to it.  Normally I would say gelato is gelato but when you spend $5.50 you expect to get your money's worth.  Luckily in this case the coconut made up for it.

Now I asked the woman working the counter if they had iced coffee as the day was hot and she said they did.  As she prepared it, I saw her come out with a full up to the rim with coffee but no ice was to be found.  I politely asked that she pour out some and add ice as that's what you want when you order and iced coffee.  She told me then that they had run out of ice and that there would be none.  At least she asked if it was ok, but not wanting to waste the drink I just took it as I had spent $3.50 for a non iced coffee.   

Based on this experience I don't think I will be going back.  For a $1.50 cheaper I can get a real iced coffee at a real coffee shop.  Sorry to say I was very disappointed this time around.



Finally had a chance to pop in today after hearing rave reviews from my child who regularly made outings there throughout the summer with her school.  It's tucked in nicely at the old mill and could be missed if it weren't for the numerous signs.

We ended up getting two gelatos that came out its two flavour options.  The person working the counter  was very attentive and was helpful in making our selections.  The amount you get for a size medium was very generous and we barely ended up having to throw away some :( the flavours we chose were mango, chocolate and lemon.  The mango was very fresh and flavourful; absolutely divine.  The chocolate was rich and creamy as well. The lemon was very tart and I like tart but this kind of bordered on a little bit sour and bitter.  However, overall the experience was great and I could definitely see it making it's mark there.  Now if only they had more flavours the potential would be endless.  We did end up walking away with some pastries as well."}
{"text":"Always great to have a new spot in Unionville. Met one of the owners tonight while stopping off for a post-dinner treat. A sweet guy that sincerely cares about the neighbourhood he grew up in as well as serving quality product. Will definitely be going here instead of the usual firehall icecream on Main St."}
{"text":"It is great to have another ice cream option in an already saturated street of frozen treats. Got there on a Sunday afternoon, and followed the sandwich boards outside. It is in the Mill on the side so there isn't a visible side on the outside. The place felt very new and clean. The two staff there were really nice and chatted with us. They had a few pastries and sandwiches in the display fridge, but it looked a bit empty

I got the tiramisu flavour in a cup, it was creamy and good exactly what you expect, i got a large chunk of frozen cake at the bottom. We also got the hazelnut flavour gelato in a nutella doughnut sandwich, it was almost $8 but was delicious! We sat outside on the bench and they have a small corner seating on the patio beside the pond."}
{"text":"It's the summer of gelato! So many great places for the tasty Italian treat. Its refreshing. It's delish. Its gelato!! And this new little place on beautiful Unionville Main Street is the real deal. I had the traditional lemon flavour and it was perfect!

The staff is so friendly. The location by the Mill is nice because it's right across from the bandstand where there are often free concerts and movie nights. If the nights are getting a bit chilly, they have espresso and coffee, too. I'm hoping to see more Italian bakery items here like cannoli, biscotti and amaretti. It's about time we got a little taste of Italy in Markham Main!

Next time we visit, we want to try the gelato sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here and sadly I did not have any gelato because I had already had ice cream just a few hours back. So instead I tried the donut that was filled with nutella and a flaky pastry with cheese filling. I brought the goodies home to comsume and enjoyed both. The nutella donut was okay but the cheese filled pastry was amazing. Super flaky and tasted very cheese on the inside. If I knew it tasted this good I would have purchased a bunch of them. There is always next time."}
{"text":"If you're coming here, only try the gelato. The gelato had great flavour, however, the other stuff I tried was not good. The panini was lacking flavour and not worth the price tag. The bombe had minimal filling and was dry and at a $2.50 price tag worse then a Tim hortons doughnut. Nevertheless, It is important to note the staff were very nice and polite."}
