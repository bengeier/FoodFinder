{"text":"Les rôtisseries portugaises affluent dans cet arrondissement du Boulevard Saint-Laurent. Par contre, chaque fois que je passe devant Kiri-Piri, j'ai l'eau à la bouche. Pourtant, je n'y étais encore jamais allé...avant hier... Il faut dire qu'un emplacement aussi stratégique (coin Saint-Laurent et Mont-Royal) est d'autant plus susceptible de piquer la curiosité de me errances, que je ne m'étais pas encore donné la chance de goûter à la culture culinaire portugaise. Je ne connais pas les autres rôtisseries du même genre, mais j'ai vraiment adoré ici mon expérience gustative.  Alors donc, j'ai décidé de me prendre un sandwich à la viande blanche de poulet rôti (il faut payer un extra pour la blanche). La viande est servie dans un pain au maïs, nappé d'une bonne sauce piquante. L'on peut choisir d'accompagner son assiette avec une montagne de frites ou patate au four. J'ai particulièrement aimé le fait que la viande blanche garde sa peau rôtie; ce qui vient rehausser (saler davantage) le goût et humidifier le sandwich, qui autrement, serait un tantinet plus sec. Ça m'a coûté 6$ sans breuvage.  Si ça n'avait pas été du cuisinier portugais en pause, assis derrière moi, criant haut et fort au cellulaire, l'ambiance aurait été plus que moche (j'étais seul). C'était donc apprécié! La clientèle passe davantage en coup de vent pour prendre son poulet pour emporter.  -Bonne machine à espresso."}
{"text":"Looks very ordinary from the outside but their rotisserie chickens are amazing, full of flavour and very tender. On top of that, the price is also quite affordable. You can get a quarter chicken with a side of salad and potatoes for $7.99 and half chicken for $11.99. The Poulet Roti is more spicy and the Poulet Grill has a bit of lemon zest flavour. I liked them both. Strongly prefer baked potatoes to french fries. And I always ask for that extra spice because it's SOOO GOOOD. Glad I stumbled across this place, definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"i had poulet grille. it comes with 5 choose 2 from potatoes, fries and 3 kinds of salads."}
{"text":"I gave this 1 star because the application doesn't allow me to put zero stars... Not only were items missing from my order (I realized once I  got home) but the food quality and taste were absolutely horrible.   The fries were under cooked, soggy and lacking taste/seasoning. The natas tasted awful and had a disturbing texture. Even the SALAD was a flop... I didn't know that salad could be so disgusting... and the chicken was cold... as in, club sandwich cold. Not warm. I feel sick.  Do yourself a favor and never eat here. I would rather burn my money than pay to eat their food ever again."}
{"text":"I was told this place had amazing sandwiches, decided to stop in today. I got a sandwich combo with coleslaw and fries. Others got a chicken breast with fries and coleslaw.  It's a small fast foody type joint. Very nice server and reasonable price. But honestly I found the chicken/sandwich very underwhelming. It just tasted like a plain chicken sandwich. No real unique or amazing flavor. Felt alright and healthy, but definitely not \"delicious\" etc.   Its an alright place to try, doubtful I'd return though."}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for a Portuguese chicken sandwich it's good to be on Boulevard St. Laurent, especially in the vicinity of Avenue du Mont-Royal. Rotisserie Kiri Piri is located is on the corner.   The warm simple space is well organized and neatly presented.   I initially ordered the classic roasted chicken sandwich with signature taste of its own drippings, with mayo and a touch of their house hot sauce on a simple soft bun (I only added black pepper from a packet).   The combination (though not complex) is very tasty and fills you up just enough to be able to fit semi-sweet rich and creamy egg tart called 'Natas'.   Both items totaled about $8.00, which is a little expensive for just two simple items, but these two are excellent ones.  The street view from the corner window table is somewhat entertaining and isn't the worst place to read or write while eating.   There are several Portuguese rotisserie joints in the area, and though it's not a write home place, this basic one holds it's own; chicken sandwich for chicken sandwich.  PS They sell their hot sauce by the jar at the counter."}
{"text":"Because I was visiting from out-of-town, I ordered the poutine with Portuguese chicken and was looking forward to that flavorful rotisserie styled chicken that the Portuguese are known for...didn't quite get that though.  I did get a very healthy and perfectly shareable plate of poutine with ample chicken and and gravy. It was, however, a little lighter on the cheese curds.  The chicken was most underwhelming.  It's a combination of the really high and probably overzealous hopes that I initially had coupled with the small burnt pieces of skin that had so much flavor which were sprinkled in, though, I think mistakenly.  I think that they falsely led me to believe that next bite would be so much better than the next.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, but it's not something that I'd ever rush back to.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably only visit if they were open late night and I was trying to sober up, or pace myself before more drinks."}
