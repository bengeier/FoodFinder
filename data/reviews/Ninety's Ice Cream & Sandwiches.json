{"text":"Perfect little ice cream shop from the prices to the sandwiches. Staff is friendly and orders are made quickly. It's located  on a broadwalk so it perfect for just a spot to relax. Make sure to grab one of the huge brownies for a buck and some change before leaving this place it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I came here over this past weekend to get some ice cream with my boyfriend and my sister who was visiting from CT. I found it about Ninety's through Instagram and Charlotte Agenda. I have been wanting to come here since the reopening back in June. Anyway, the ice cream was good but it is definitely more of a novelty than great taste. I tried the peanut butter cookie dough pop which isn't ice cream but straight up cookie dough. It took more than the three minutes they recommend to defrost and overall it didn't taste like much. My boyfriend got one of the hot doughnuts with the ice cream inside. This was also pretty good but he commented that there wasn't enough ice cream inside. Still pretty impressive that the ice cream doesn't fully melt when the doughnut is heated! Finally, my sister got the birthday cake macaroon ice cream sandwich. This was probably the best thing we tried. It came with cake chunks and a buttercream drizzle! Overall, I think there are better ice cream spots in the Charlotte area but I'm glad we checked this place out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard tuna melt, except that there were peas in it, which was kinda weird. The potato salad was just ok. 

Basic decor: kinda boring. Nice location with a decent crowd. You could stop by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon, then chill at the lake, which is right around the corner. You can eat directly outside the restaurant, and they'll serve you outside. 

Decent price. I would consider eating here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it."}
{"text":"This place was great. Stumbled upon it, and was really impressed by the taste and hospitality."}
{"text":"Great place if you love sweets! Definitely recommend the yummy buns! If you have a sweet tooth then this is the place for you. The staff is amazing and they take pride in everything they do! ... Cookie dough pops are also a favorite"}
{"text":"The bottom of the cereal bowl milkshakes and macaroon ice cream sandwiches are a must! The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!! Was totally impressed by the service and it could only be matched by the incredible taste"}
{"text":"More than ice cream and sammiches. They have this Cajun chicken that is AMAZEBALLS. It's not like any other Cajun chicken you have had, trust me. It's spicy and so flavorful. 

I personally love the salad version with their homemade vinaigrette, my hubster prefers the sammich version. You can't go wrong with either. It's a cute little family owned shop that has always been pleasant to us. Plus they have a quirky sense of humor. Peep their register display screen the next time you are there ;)"}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches.  The ice cream looked great but I didn't try it.

Husband and I both had the BLT which was good.  Nice crisp bacon on some kind of toasted egg bread.

All very reasonable priced.

The only reason for the two stars is that we both had some tummy issues about an hour or so later and that was the last thing we ate.  If it wasn't for that I would give another star.

I could be encouraged to give this place another go though and hope that it's a one off just because the food tasted so good."}
{"text":"My first trip to this establishment was very pleasing. They serve Hershey's ice cream at reasonable prices and the staff was helpful and had personality. I got a double scoop cone of strawberry and chocolate and my daughter got strawberry lemonade Italian ice. We were both pleased with our selections.  I also tasted the strawberry cheesecake and cinnamon roll ice cream which were both amazing. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Ninety's has been a staple in University area for quite some time now and they recently revamped and renovated the interior of the store.  The menu was also revamped, with there now being a main focus on ice cream and desserts offered. The last two times I got the Yum-eee bun and both times I got the S'mores one with graham cracker crumbles, chocolate ice cream and marshmallows wedged between a heated up glazed donut.  Each time I feel like I tasted more of just the donut and the ice cream than the graham cracker crumbles and marshmallows, but the concept is interesting and is a great treat if you are looking to indulge a little bit. They have other types of Yum-eee buns and you can also create your own. In addition, they have traditional ice cream offerings, macaroon ice cream sandwiches, cookie dough pops and cereal milk shakes as some of the things you will find here. It's pretty original compared to anything else in the area. Prices are a little high in my opinion for some of the things they offer, but the place seems to do really well, especially since remodeling the store. I recommend it, but try to avoid the place on a Weekend evening in the summer since the place can be packed with a line to the door."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I'm impressed with the macaroon ice cream sandwiches. I'm also pretty sure everything else here is great hence the long line when I entered. This is the only place I know that serves one of my favorite ice cream; superman ice cream. What makes it even better is that they served it as a macaroon ice cream sandwich! We also got the strawberry shortcake macaroon ice cream sandwich which was amazing as well! Love that the store has a laid back environment. Highly recommend for anyone looking for dessert after a meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for shakes! Can't wait to come back and try the food! We got the Sonoma Girl Scout cookie shake and the fruity pebble cereal shake! Both were on point! The shakes are not thick so if you like yours thick, I'd request that! I thought they were the perfect consistency! Great place"}
{"text":"I really like this place! They really try to make your ice cream experience better! I had the \"Cookie Monster\" (cookies and cream ice cream with Cookie Crisp cereal and chocolate syrup) perfect to share if you're not to much into sweets."}
{"text":"Talk about Instagram-worthy desserts! We stumbled upon this location in a hidden strip mall after a day out of shopping. So glad we did!

We both ordered milkshakes and they were SO TASTY. I can't wait to come back and try their sandwiches and other unique desserts."}
{"text":"The yum ee bun ice cream sandwich might have been the best thing I have ever eaten! Combining a warm donut, ice cream, and rolled in cereal is a genius idea! Can't wait to come back and try and different combination. 

The customer service was great as well. The team was very knowledgeable and you can create your own custom combinations.

Very cute decor and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here! My friend and I can in for ice cream and we were in for a treat. She got a sandwich and said it was amazing and a ice cream drink. I had the Thai tea macaroon ice cream sandwich. It was delicious and a refreshing take on an ice cream sandwich. It was decently busy when we arrived, the staff was great at moving people through the line!"}
{"text":"Who says no to desserts? Hardly no one I ever know! After walking a bit at the Boardwalk, we decided to get ice cream at Ninety's Ice Cream & Sandwiches. Since we already ate lunch, we skipped on the sandwiches and just ordered ice cream. I got the salted caramel chocolate ice cream in a waffle cone. I really love the flavors and liked the chocolate chunks, not to mention the creaminess of the texture. Next time whenever I do come back to Charlotte, I will come back and try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love the renovations! Definitely an Instagram worthy place and products. But the ice cream is good but really not worth the price. Everything is overpriced-especially if you order anything more than just plain ice cream."}
{"text":"Ninety's has SO much hype around it and it's been on my list all summer to try it out. Its University location isn't the most convenient, but I finally made it up there.

I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I walked away thrilled. To be fair, I am not very interested in their specialty treats - the macaron ice cream sandwiches or cookie dough pops.I just tried a good old-fashioned waffle cone with two flavors - moose tracks and some peanut butter pretzel something (the scooper mumbled the flavor name and I heard peanut butter so I went for it). Both flavors were solid - the moose tracks had an insane amount of fudge in it (delicious but honestly a little too much for me) and the peanut butter element of the other flavor was just enough. My friend got the brownie milkshake which was definitely underwhelming. 

If I go back, I'll try a more exciting milkshake with the edible rim. Otherwise, Two Scoops still wins best ice cream in Charlotte. I gave them four stars for their unique offerings in which I happen to have limited interest. There's gotta be hype for a reason, right?!

Note on the location: the shop is located in a large shopping center and parking is somewhat of a nightmare. We went at 8pm on a Friday and it took five minutes to find parking. There was no line when we walked in but there was a long line when we left. Expect this place to be ALWAYS busy. However, they move quickly and have a lot of people working behind the counter, so the wait should never be unbearable."}
{"text":"after following your instagram for a couple months i was really excited to head up there. it was a 30 minute drive so I had been waiting for an opportunity to make the trip. however, after following the instagram for so long, i was kind of disappointed. the woman working there seemed really done with everything and didn't seem like she wanted to serve us. we got the s'mores macaroon, green tea milkshake, and a cookies and cream yummee bun. the bun was amazing and the green tea milkshake was good but the s'mores macaroon was just a ton of chocolate ice cream with a couple of marshmallows thrown on the side. i was disappointed with the milkshake because the lady didn't do any of the cool side decorating that i had seen on the instagram and in the other reviews. altogether the yummy bun was delicious butthe service and other items were average, and the decorating (which is what i thought was one of the key characteristics of the store) was not good :("}
{"text":"There's a wide variety of sandwiches to choose from.  The chunky chicken melt kind of tastes like Thanksgiving, I don't know how to describe it better than that.  It was just really good.  The ice cream was pretty good.  I've had better, but not very often.  The service could have been better.  The people just kind of seemed uninterested, if that makes any sense.  Overall, I'll probably be back if I'm in that part of town, but I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go here and I finally got the chance to go tonight!  And oh my it was an amazing decision. My fiancé got a macaroon ice cream sandwich. They only had a couple flavors available but she got a birthday cake macaroon. The ice cream had chunks of cake in it. I got the doughnut sandwich. I can't member the exact name but it was amazing.  They have a menu you can chose from but you can also create your own.  I ordered a cookie dough ice cream with strawberry syrup and strawberry short cake crumbs. They make it right in front of you and then warm up the doughnut. It was very good. Will definitely be going back to this place many to try their many creations."}
{"text":"Awesome little ice cream shop. We got a milkshake to share which was plenty for two people. We got the option of all edible rim which was quite nice. Milkshake it shelf comes with very large straw which you can actually use for a milkshake. This was nice because I did not finish all the milkshake at the restaurant so I took it on the road with me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops when I come to the. Boardwalk. 

Before the renovation they use to have really good sandwiches too. I asked about it and they said they will eventually bring back the hot foods they use to serve. 

The renovation looks great! 

The sweets are sooooo good! A little too good. Lol. I tried their new cookie dough pops, they're good but a little too too sweet for my liking. Also the same with their macaron ice cream and their milkshakes. Although good, it's too sweet, so keep that in mind. The taro milkshake made me miss their old taro smoothie that didn't consists of ice cream and was just right. 

I can't wait for their hot foods to return. 

Their service is good too, it was always good in the past but I think with how business is they hired more workers to get the flow going faster."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful ice cream gem! The cookie dough pops are fantastic (I had the Twix) and the peanut butter ice cream sandwich was also super yummy! The staff was super helpful and nice and were really quick with our order. I would definitely check this place out if you like ice cream and fun deserts!"}
{"text":"I love getting there mango stuff!! It's so good!! It salty, soury, and have spices to it which I love the most! I have gotten this like twice and both times I have loved it. I also love there ice cream! My friends have gotten their different drinks/ milkshake and they have love it. I love this place. This place has never disappointed me!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because I absolutely love their ice cream but the only thing is I wish the workers were more friendly. At least a smile would be nice but hey the ice cream is delicious so that won't stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Macaroons lately and was super excited to see they had Macaron ice cream sandwiches!! I had the one with coffee and toffee  ( I can't remember the name, don't judge me). They have a lot of cool flavors that I can't wait to go back and try. The decor is a little..blah but it's in a good location so you could take it outside or walk around the lake. The young lady at the register was super nice. This place will probably be a frequent stop for me over the summer."}
{"text":"We finally took the endeavor to the Boardwalk to try Ninety's. I love the concept of this place: sandwiches and novelty ice cream stuff.

First, for a Sunday evening, I was shocked at how packed it was- the line was out the door. Wasn't sure if this was a staffing issue or if t just took forever to make the orders. The line moved at an ok pace.

Second of all, and I feel like this was glaring... THEY WERE NOT PLAYING ANY 90s MUSIC!!!! Also no 90s decor whatsoever. For a #beninetiescool they kind of drop the ball on that. The sandwich menu (which should be placed on the incoming side of the line instead of the far end) were all 90s themed names, so they committed there. But I'm not sure why that was the extent of the theme. The rest of the decor was lacking too. They had valentine's day decorations up which was nice. But low tile ceiling and tile floors made it feel cramped.

As far as the actual food...
- Reuben: not too bad. Nice and warm, great thousand island sauce. 
- Ice cream shake: got the choco lotta coconut. Was hoping it would have more of the caramel, coconut and shortbread cookies mixed in. Also, the ice cream was Hershey's. I'm not against it, but it was just average. 
- Yummee Buns: okay these were DELICIOUS. Perfect hunny buns, and the perfect amount of toppings and ice cream. These are basically ice cream sandwiches with a hunny bun as the outer part. We got the OG (vanilla with strawberry shortcake spread and sprinkles) and the peanut butter chocolate one with chocolate ice cream and Reese's. Both delicious!!!
- Ice cream macaroons: also pretty good. The macaroons were perfect. Again I wish the ice cream was a little better than Hershey's, but the toppings were nice. I didn't get these, but I did have a bite.

So 3 stars due to long line and lack of decor (really selling themselves short on this- could be an easy fix). The sandwiches were pretty good, and the desserts were good, but had a little to be desired. I would definitely drive up there again just for a Yummee Bun again though!!!"}
{"text":"A great twist on ice cream sandwiches! Stopped by around 9 on a Saturday night. It was very busy but the service was great. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was awesome. The sandwiches can be served as they are listed on on the menu, or you can change things to your liking. I ordered the Cookie Monster, as is, and it was pretty awesome. The sandwich is served with several fillings and the donut it's served in is warm. 

Definitely a must if you enjoy ice cream!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place a couple years ago. One of very places in Charlotte that serves superman ice cream. And it's delicious. Today I had the pleasure of trying the superman macaroon ice cream sandwich. They recently renovated and it looks super cool."}
{"text":"Best ice cream I have ever had. Service is great and ice cream is amazing. Sometimes they are really busy and it make take a little until you get your ice cream, definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable with their ice cream creations. They have a whole tablet filled with your choices of ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. I got the lucky charm macaroon sandwich and it was delicious. About $6 so a little pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, this town is lucky to have Ninety's
Top shelf treats.
Best ice cream sandwich ever.
Milkshakes will bring all the boys to the yard.
I can't believe they get the crunchies from strawberry shortcakes.
Amazing stuff.
Clean and friendly.
Huge fan."}
{"text":"So, so good. The cookie dough pops are the best. Anything on a yummie bun is amazing. It is clean, atmosphere is totally 90's music. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So finally got here. Been wanting to go since they re opened but haven't been able to make it. 

I've been wanting cookie dough like no other so cookie dough bar was the mission. I picked up the m&ms bar and the Reese's bar and brought them home for me and the fiancé. They were both $5 so I was really hoping they'd be worth it. They're good but not what I was dreaming of, I think maybe it needs a little salt to really hit that cookie dough flavor, fiancé agrees. They just seemed to be lacking something. I don't think I'll be getting them again. 

I do wanna go back and try the macaron sandwiches and milkshakes though!"}
{"text":"This place was cool. I had The Vietnamese coffee yumee bun, which was good. My daughter had the Oreo oh my gosh milkshake thingie, which was divine! If we go back, I will try something other than a bun. For those two items, we paid $13. Not bad. Good staff."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was before they remodeled the shop. I had a macaron ice cream and the macaron was dry and not as chewy as other macarons are. Their ice cream is great! So 10/10 for the ice cream!

Came back after they had recently updated their menu and remodeled because I have seen people RAVING about their new products. The ice cream is still great as usual. I got the Cookie Monster Yum-ee Bun and I was not that impressed. The actual bun is like a dry croissant with glaze on it. I recommend keeping the buns warm and making it fluffier, it would compliment the ice cream more. I also didn't get much ice cream in mine. The buns though were a great disappointment for me. I saw the cookie dough pops and they were HUGE. I definitely want to try them next time I come in and also give the macarons another try."}
{"text":"This place is definetly a diamind in the rough! They have the best macaron ice cream sandwiches in charlotte hands down!! My boyfriend and I came for ice cream and noticed these huge amazing macarons and we were definitely not disappointed. We got the pistachio and the strawberry cheesecake macaron ice cream sandwiches and they were delicious!! I will definitely come again and I'll be bringing in more people with me!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream shop we found during race weekend. Amazing ice cream and shakes. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for their famous macaron ice cream sandwiches. But they run out pretty fast so you gotta come early. Also this place has ice cream and other selections of small bite and drinks."}
{"text":"This was pretty decent. I tried the strawberry shortcake yum-ee bun. They do something pretty cool that allows the bun to stay warm but the ice cream in the middle doesn't melt. The bun tastes like a sweet dinner roll but not as sweet as a donut. The ice cream is normal strawberry ice cream. The person I was with had a cookie dough milkshake and they thought it was decent. I did see some pretty cool looking other options."}
{"text":"I had the donut ice cream sandwich with vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles. It was yummmyyyyyy!!! I will be back and will bring others with me! The staff was great too. I'll have to try some other yummy items on the menu next time."}
{"text":"This place is a nice dessert place at the boardwalk. It was super hot and humid that I needed a fix and they were happy to oblige. I only got one scoop, but the serving was more than satisfactory which is more than what I can say about most places. Absolutely no negative impressions. The place inside looks old and could use a makeover to make it more appealing for people to come in."}
{"text":"Y'all ninety's is a dessert lovers paradise! We went for the first time yesterday after reading tons of great reviews on yelp and seeing the cool pics of the tasty treats. It for sure lived up to the hype. The guy taking our order was super helpful and when he found out it was our first time he pulled out an iPad and walked us through the menu with pictures of all the treats. They have freshly fried donuts and stuff them with ice cream and toppings, they have cereal milkshakes, cookie dough pops and macaroon ice cream sandwiches. We both got milkshakes- I can't remember the name of mine but it was like a samoa cookie and my husband got the Reese's puff shake.  It was SO GOOD!!! My shake tasted just like the samoa Girl Scout cookie. The Reese's puff one was really good as well. I wish I didn't live so far away because I'd be there at least weekly but I guess it's a good thing for my waistline"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I love cookies and cream so of course I tried that flavor which was amazing. But since I also love coffee I just had to try the coffee cookies and cream. OMG!!!! The best coffee ice cream mix I've ever had. Surely recommend this place. They didn't receive 5 stars cause their service could be better and there wasn't any tissue in the restroom.  But the ice cream is delish."}
{"text":"Generic ice cream . Shitty quality. Nothing tastes fresh. Huge disappointment after looking at the positive ratings. Was expecting much better."}
{"text":"this place is awesome!!! the macaroon ice cream sandwiches are the bomb!!!!! kids will love this place as well as adults!!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! After seeing multiple Instagram posts of the macaroon ice cream sandwiches I had to try Ninety's out! I came around 9pm on a Friday and the plaza Ninety's is located in was packed! Inside the shop was busy, but surprising most people were ordering the homemade ice cream. They had about 12 different flavors, but my heart was set on the macaroon sandwich. 

I looked in the freezer and there had to be 15 different flavors. The ones that popped out the most were pistachio, peanut butter, play dough (cookie dough), birthday cake and strawberry shortcake. My husband and I decided the split the birthday cake macaroon ($5.95). Note they will cut it in half for you and it was easily big enough to split. 

Ok the sandwich. Wow! The ice cream was cake batter mixed with cake pieces, sprinkles and frosting. And the macaroon was super soft! I thought it would be hard from the freezer, but I was wrong. It was such a perfect mix. Eating the ice cream and macaroon together was so delicious! This was probably one of my favorite ice cream treats Ive ever had. 

There's also a lake near Ninety's where you can sit or walk around, plus they have paddle boats available. It would be a great little date night to enjoy the paddle boats and go for some Ninety's. 

I will definitely be back this summer!"}
{"text":"Got the strawberry shortcake macaron sandwich and my expectations were exceeded by far. Friend got banana pudding macaron sandwich and was equally impressed. Workers were friendly and willing to help us out as new customers.

Will return!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity! Macaroon ice cream sandwiches. ..need I say more? You are in for a perfect treat."}
{"text":"Ah this place was recommended by friends from Charlotte during our visit, and we LOVED it!
Sometimes beautiful desserts are just that, but the ice cream, macaroons, and shakes here were DELICIOUS!

I tried the strawberry green tea macaroon sandwich - LARGE green tea macaroons on each side with strawberry ice cream (with huge real strawberry chunks inside). It was phenomenal! They also added some matcha drizzle.

My sister loved their chocolate shake!

They charge appropriately - I felt like $6 was appropriate for the huge macaroons and the large scoop of ice cream. Definitely recommend! Get some ice cream to cool down and then head over to to the lake for some paddleboating!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a while. AND IM SO HAPPY I DID!! 

I had the Taro ice cream sandwich. IT WAS SO GOOD!  I would most definitely go back. My kids had the milkshake and they also said it was really good. I just love coconut ice cream it's THE BOMB.COM!!  
It's by the broad walk so it's in a wonderful location. 

The Inside is small due to the customer flow. They would need to get a larger space. As customers was getting up from the tables no one was cleaning them off and wiping down the tables. It's a ice cream place and of course tables and chairs will get messy, so that's more of the reason they should be  cleaned after every usage. I was going to eat inside but the it was ice cream all over the chairs."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled to try this place based on reviews, and I left rather underwhelmed. My group of friends got everything from cereal milkshakes to chicken wraps to sundaes...and it was all \"meh. this has potential!\"  Skip the Lucky Charms milkshake. I couldn't taste any ice cream...just the mushy cereal. Maybe that's the goal, but at an ice cream shop, whether or not it's a cereal focused dish, ice cream should also shine. Also it was expensive! The food took a long time for what it was, and the sundaes were nothing special. We did not try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches so I can't comment on that. Really 'potential' is the word for this place because with some more tweaks it could be something extraordinary."}
{"text":"After reading an article in Charlotte Agenda about Ninety's Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches I had to have one! I live very close to Ninety's and never knew that they offered so much here. But I stayed on my mission to get a macaroon ice cream sandwich. There was so many flavors it was hard to choose from (even though Ive heard the Birthday cake is the best) but since I am all about pumpkin right now I chose the Pumpkin flavor. Not to be mistaken with the Pumpkin Bread, there is a difference smh! The Macaroon sandwich is huge! They offer to cut it in half but I decided to take mine to go. 

This ice cream sandwich was amazing!! and everything I hoped it to be! The macaroon is totally a macaroon and is flaky per usual. The ice cream was great as well! It taste exactly like pumpkin. It was a little bit too much for me, I definitely could not finish the whole sandwich but it would be perfect to possibly share.
I cant wait to come back and try the Birthday cake!"}
{"text":"I recently tried this place and I was very impressed with how delicious their sandwiches are. I have tried the chicken salad sandwich and the reuben and they were great. Super cheap prices and fast and friendly service. BTW their smoothies are pretty good too. I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept and their selections are definitely Instagram worthy. I tried this after seeing it in one of our online newsletters here in Charlotte but it wasn't quite so enticing that I've ever made an effort to try it again."}
{"text":"I love 90's! A little slow and sometimes the cleanliness is questionable - but there's nothing better than their App Wrap."}
{"text":"The place is a classic, Charlotte staple. This is where dessert dreams are made. Grab an ice cream and take a walk around the lake. It'll cancel out."}
{"text":"Best creative and tasting ice cream sandwiches ever.

Who can say no to their favorite ice cream between two warm donuts slices? Not me. 

I try to share this delicious piece of heaven because the amount is gigantic. However, even sharing it; you still get to enjoy more than enough of this beautiful piece of Delight.

Go NOW!"}
{"text":"My little girl and her friends absolutely loved their Unicorn Milkshakes. The ice cream cookies take 2 hands to enjoy! This place is full of good Sugar and is out of sight. Hidden to those that are not looking  .... it has been around for years and I never thought to go inside until recently ... we love it"}
{"text":"i freaking LOVE this place! The employees are so nice. the environment is clean and everyone seems so delighted over their cute little treats!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to charlotte ! Strawberry shortcake milkshake ...I also had a macaroon icecream sandwich but I ate it too quickly and didn't get a picture .. the flavor was birthday cake and the macaroon had the right amount of chewy and crunchy"}
{"text":"Wow. Do you love macaroons? Do you love ice cream? Well I'm here to tell you they are amazing together!!! It's not just hype- their products are good quality and the guy who helped me made me something that wasn't on the menu that I saw on yelp. It was sooooooo good. There's so many things to choose from so do your homework a little bit before you go if it takes you a little while to make your mind up."}
{"text":"AYYY after hearing about this place selling MACARON ICECREAM, I HAD to have one!! They had so many flavors to choose from, pistachio, cotton candy, coconut, strawberry, etc. I had the strawberry shortcake & my mom had the coconut! The strawberry shortcut was so cute! It also tasted veryyy good not too sweet just how I like it! (Coconut was good too, I like how they put nuts in it!) I just wish it wasn't so big, beware guys! I could just finished half of mine, next time I'll probably just end up splitting it with someone! Cool place to check out if your ever in the boardwalk area(:"}
{"text":"Instagram worthy. You could probably ask for anything on the menu and it wouldn't be bad. From donut ice cream sandwiches, to over the top milkshakes, and baka splits. They also have actual food, but I have not tried that yet. If you have a sweet tooth, give Ninety's a try!"}
{"text":"I am probably not the best person to ask about Ice cream and other sweet treats but I loved Ninetys. I got something super tame (1 scoop of cookies and cream, strawberry drizzle, with Oreos on top). They have so many options and really found a way to reinvent the ice cream sandwich. 

There is definitely something for everyone here and I encourage everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place after reading yelp reviews. I was so happy one night when my husband came home from work early-ish and said he was feeling ice cream! I instantly knew we should try out Ninety's. 

He got an oreo milkshake. It was large and very thick. I thought it tasted OK. It wasn't the best milkshake I've ever had.

I got a kids cone of banana cream pie. It was actually really good! It's the same cost to get it in a cone or a cup, so I obviously got it in a cone. 

I look forward to coming back and trying some of their more fun menu items. The yum-ee buns look interesting and I think I would like the macaroon icecream sandwich too!

The shop itself is small and there isn't a ton of seating. There was a line when we got there, but it moved very quickly. 

We have plenty to come back for and look forward to trying other treats here!"}
{"text":"This place can be deceiving because the first thing you see on their sign is ice cream and I always thought that it was a predominantly ice cream shop. However, this place has the best sandwiches for the price in all of north Charlotte. Their potato salad is amazing and I recommend getting it with whichever tasty delight you choose. Their ice cream is good, bit we always go for sandwiches. Excellent lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I liked the food here. Different twists on some typically made at home sandwiches. If your on your lunch break allow yourself some time. It's friendly and seems to be family run but preparation is deliberate slow paced. Worth the wait, though. Ice cream products are good but that's not why I go there.

Interior is clean but very few tables - 5,6?  If it's good weather there are some places outside - otherwise plan to take out. Seats were not comfortable."}
{"text":"Okay so after my last review of Ninety's about week ago for me (which I have removed to write this) I promised to give Ninety's another chance and did so. I can honestly say I still love there sandwiches, the 90's style names are great, I had the Carlton and the Uncle Jessy. They even changed the shop a little since my last review in the way that the sandwich menu is now out in the shop on a board like the Ice Cream and I was able to get a sandwich past 8:00 p.m. 

I'm absolutely in love with the thin mint cookie dough pops now that I've tried one, I'm in love with the regular cookie dough bits candy and it's like the bigger flavored version of one of those, so of course I love it. 

I even went back twice that day, which is how I ended up trying a second sandwich for a late dinner. I wasn't expecting to go back, but I ended up picking my friend/roommate up from her late class and then she complained about Charlotte not having any good milkshake places open... I wasn't sure where she got that, but I remember that Ninety's probably had milkshakes and decided to make a quackish stop there for her. They did have milkshakes and she loved every second of the frosting rolled milkshake. She's definitely a fan now and we will be going back."}
{"text":"Such a neat place, love the concept! very cute and different! Will definitely be back! wish they had a location closer to charlotte maybe in plaza or Noda!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  I got the the ice cream sandwich the first time (Cookie Monster).  Then tried the strawberry shortcake milkshake on the second visit.  The ice cream sandwich was much much better especially with the macaroon cookie.  I would probably get that again and regular ice cream.  I didn't like the milkshake much because of the crumbles at the bottle of the cup kept getting in the way of my straw and the crumbles around the cup fell but neat idea with icing to hold it for looks."}
{"text":"Yum-e-buns!! Very friendly staff and lots of yummy treats! So creative! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Ninety's was first brought to my attention vía numerous Instagram tags of the most delectable-looking treats. It eventually became too much to handle and I finally gave in to my girlfriends persistence. Boy am I glad I did. 

Tucked in along the Boardwalk in University Area this place is producing ice cream and desserts that both look and taste amazing. I had been wanting to try this place for a while and I intend to return again soon. They have an iPad to help you select what you want, and they can make anything you may have seen on Instagram, even if it is no longer on the menu. 

The decision process was trying, but ultimately we decided to go with some form of a chocolate milkshake with an edible outer rim. It was both unique and delicious. The staff here were very helpful and patient as we explored the endless possibilities. I have to be back."}
{"text":"Their daily special was the bomb. They don't shy away from adding enough meat! It's hard for me to believe people go to Subway when little shops like this exist. Good location. Great staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Note quite a peanut butter galore... Just tasted like chocolate ice cream between a glazed donut. The Italian Stallion was pretty good, but $8.00 is a bit much for a sandwich and chips. Their milkshakes definitely appear to go the extra mile like in their pictures, but the Yum-Ee Buns like mine are disappointing."}
{"text":"Unfortunate that you'll stand there waiting for service and no one will speak to you. Then another customer comes in and is immediately helped. Walked out without buying and will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying their macaroon ice cream and when I got there, they ran out of the ones I wanted! I opted for a random one and I didn't think it was really worth the price. The staff was okay, the guy seemed annoyed that I couldn't decide what I wanted right off the bat, but there was no one else in line or marked what they did or didn't have! I think next time if I can, I would come earlier to try it. My boyfriend got the fruity pebble milkshake and it really did taste like fruity pebbles but it was way too sweet. It was hard to finish it but nonetheless it was good."}
{"text":"I actually had really high expectations for this place based on their endless Instagram feed full of amazing-looking ice cream creations. I came here on a weekday with a few coworkers over lunch, so we had the place to ourselves. The atmosphere was about what you would expect from a specialty ice cream shop... pastel walls, ice cream counter, a bunch of small tables, menus on the walls, etc. There were two employees there at the time, both of whom were very nice and gave us some good suggestions on toppings and combos.

I ordered the Reese's Puffs macaron sandwich, which was made with chocolate ice cream rolled into a ball and then coated with crushed Reese's Puffs cereal and then squished between two macarons with some whole Reese's Puffs placed around the edges. The sandwich was so thick, it was a bit of a challenge to eat. The employee recommended taking a spoon to the edges to start to reduce the size before eating it like a more traditional ice cream sandwich. 

As much as it was a very pretty creation, I can't say that the ice cream tasted any better than any other ice cream. It was just a generic chocolate that tasted like your average tub from the freezer aisle. The addition of the cereal added a little pizzazz, but nothing as impressive as I was hoping for. I was also surprised to see the macarons were a bright blue color.. which while pretty, is not super appetizing and turned my lips a little blue.

I will go ahead and say that I have had another experience with Ninety's at a pop-up festival in Charlotte and I had an apple fritter sandwich... and that was amazing. So maybe it's just about what you order."}
{"text":"So I started following this page on instagram after randomly (maybe not so random) seeing one of the shakes on my explore page. Even though it is not in my neighborhood I do travel to the neighborhood it's in often. So finally I took the time to stop by on a Saturday evening. Even though it was Saturday it's not exactly warm yet so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of wait time. I'm pleased to say even though there was a little line the wait time was less than 5 minutes. This shop is known for it's ice cream sandwiches and shakes. I opted for the \"Bottom of the Bowl\" Shake. This one was included whatever cereal topping you want. They do have a variety of cereals but I decided to go with crunch berries. When I tell you it was one of the best shakes I've ever had it's no exaggeration! I loved every minute of it including the edible rim on the cup! Might I add it's a pretty photogenic shake too. I finished it in a few minutes along with the edible rim which I believe to be frosting with crushed cereal pieces. My son got a regular cup of ice cream which he also enjoyed. I can't wait to come back in the warmer months and try another flavor Or another item all together!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. It is our go to icecream spot in the university area. I loved how patient they are when you are trying to decide what you want because they have so many yummy options."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I'm obsessed with milkshakes so I was looking for a new spot as I just moved here a week ago. I've already been here twice!! It's so delicious! I plan to try everything but right not I'm hooked on the shakes! ICE YO CUP!!"}
{"text":"The ice cream and smoothies are delicious. The only reason I rated them so long its because they have really bad customer service. The person who \"helped\" me out had an attitude the whole time. He acted like he was there against his will or something. I would not go back because I didn't feel welcomed at all."}
{"text":"Ninety's has you covered for ice cream! However, before their renovations, they used to have THE best sandwiches (especially the BLT) and THE best potato salad. Their new sandwich menu has much to be desired and they've limited their side options to chips. Oh how I wish they would bring back the original food menu."}
{"text":"This little place has poor decor and it looks outdated. BUT IT'S FOOD IS AWESOME! !!  I'm a bacon, sausage, steak and cheese loving individual.  BUT, I love their veggie wrap, and I would have it everyday for lunch if I could.  Their wraps and sandwiches are so delicious.  I have been going here for over two years, and will continue to go."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing and I now will only eat macaroons as ice cream sandwiches. ORDER ONE OF EVERYTHING"}
{"text":"My expectations were high after seeing all the beautiful Instagram photos of shakes, cookie dough pops and ice cream sandwiches. The presentation did not disappoint. Everyone walking out of the store had photo-worthy creations. 

I ordered the mint milkshake. While it was tasty, I didn't think it was worth the $6 + extra money I spent to get the cookies on the outside of the cup. I think my mistake was going for something safe like a milkshake. Next time, I would try one of the yum-ee buns or macaroon ice cream sandwiches. 

There is indoor and outdoor seating. You can also enjoy your ice cream down by the water. It's a great spot for date night. Go paddle boating and then stop in here for a treat!

The staff was friendly. Even though the line was long, they were quick at getting people through the line to order. I would suggest having a menu face the direction of the door or have paper menus for people to look at while they are waiting in line. I was slightly annoyed at the wait time for the two milkshakes I ordered. The first one came out about fast after placing my order which was great! The second one didn't come out for about another 10 minutes. There were several people that ordered after us that received their milkshakes before we received the second one.

If you're looking to get a lot of likes on your Instagram, order one of their photo-worthy creations!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fancy-type bread, not a large selection for the kids.  Ice cream seems okay, if not outstanding.  Reasonably quick and friendly service, more affordable than some of the other options in the area."}
{"text":"They have amazing ice cream. The lines are a little long during the summer months but it's definitely worth it.  Heard the food was good and worth it as well. They have great favors of ice cream."}
{"text":"Ninety's is cool and sweet, just like their ice cream. I haven't had their sandwiches, but I dropped by for a seat on their patio & indulged in a little afternoon treat. 

The coconut ice cream was smooth and tasty, just like I thought it would be. The staff behind the counter was a little disenchanted...maybe he was up later pulling an all nighter? Regardless, my order of two scoop of ice cream and two bottled waters came to $6 and change. That, I can handle.

If you seek a sweet treat in University City,  head over to Ninety's and be sure to enjoy that spacious shared patio!"}
{"text":"There is no other place in Charlotte making frozen treats like this. 

Macaron ice cream sandwiches, yum-ee buns (aka donut ice cream sammies), cookie dough pops, crazy creative milkshakes (including cereal ones)- it all makes Charlotte feel so trendy in the ice cream world. If you're looking for a place to grab a cheap ice cream cone, this isn't it. Expect to pay more for the novelty. 

The biggest surprise for me was how delicious the macaron was on my strawberry shortcake sandwich. It was actually better than a lot of ones I've gotten from local bakeries. Bravo Ninety's. 

It's definitely worth the trip. Make sure to snap a pic before you dive in, these treats are totally 'Gram worthy."}
{"text":"Love Love love, such a friendly staff and wonderful icecream options. If you're going on a weekend be prepared for a line. They do tend to get busy, especially on warm days."}
{"text":"So glad this was my intro to Charlotte. Been to the city before but not as a foodie, so was delighted to get this sweet first treat. After doing some research I found I had to stop at this place for a delicious and Instagram worthy snack. I wasn't disappointed. Staff was friendly attentive and caterered to my food blogger tendencies. It was busy which is always a good sign and decorated for St. Patrick's - I like it when food establishments acknowledge stuff like that. More so when it is reflected in the menu. Definitely try their macaroon ice cream sandwiches. Delicious! I would also recommend a getting one of their signature cookie dough pops. Don't really eat edible cookie dough often, but the ones they serve had me wanting another. Next time I want a milkshake, they look amazing too."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I used to go to this nice cream shop all the time back when I was in high school and lived in Charlotte. Over the last year or so it has been totally revamped! Today it serves all kinds of Instagram worthy treats sure to knock your socks off. The location is perfect since it is near UNCC and located in the University Lake area where lots of people spend their weekends enjoying the good food and scenery. The service here was great and I was given information about each of their popular items. I decided to go with the salted caramel brownie macroon ice cream sandwhich. This was pretty large but was good to share with my husband. They had other flavors such as red velvet, along with a number of doughnut ice cream sandwhiches as well. From looking on their instagram I can tell that they frequently change flavors to keep up with the season. This place is a definite must go if I'm the UNCC area!"}
{"text":"Really great ice cream place! A couple people told me about this place and told me it was a must. I ordered a macaroon ice cream sandwich ($5), vanilla with cinnamon toast crunch pieces on the outside. The ice cream was a lot better than I expected it to be. It was sweet but not too sweet for me at least, I didn't really eat the macaroon pieces. They also sell wild shakes too. There is an ipad sitting on the counter you can scroll through and look at some of the different things you can order. They also sell ice cream stuffed doughnuts which looked pretty tasty.  There is a nice pond and boardwalk next to ninetys and it's attached to a strip mall of restaurants and stores. Parking is all around, it just depends on where you park to see how far you have to walk."}
{"text":"YUSSSSSSSS MACAROON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES IN CHARLOTTE! THEYRE SO GOOD! Highly recommend the fruity pebbles macaroon ice cream sandwich! So yummy! But you have to eat them fast! They'll melt soon! 

Love the environment and coziness of the place. The location is great too. Had a GREAT first experience! Definitely going again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently a lot of you don't know the difference between macarons & macaroons.. THEY ARE 2 DIFFERENT COOKIES PEOPLE.

Ninety's specializes in MACARON ice cream sandwiches & they are incredibly messy to eat but delicious! My first visit was around this time a year ago, before their renovations to the store & the menu revamp. The macaron ice cream sandwiches at that time looked like they were prepared ahead of time & kept in a freezer. There were a few of each in about 15-20 different flavors. I opted for the pistachio flavor, mostly because I like the color green, & my friend chose the birthday cake flavor. The macarons were a little dried out since they were kept in a freezer but other than that my friend & I were hooked! They were huge & a good deal for this novelty at $5.95 each. 

I came back again during the summer, after their renovations were completed. I will say I was a little disappointed to see that they only had about 4-5 flavors of macaron sandwiches available (rotating daily, maybe?) BUT now they were making them to order, instead of preparing a bunch of them & keeping them in the freezer. This way the macarons won't get dried out & they did seem a lot fresher this time around. 

My most recent visit was a couple of days ago. I was in the area & wanted to hit up all of my spots before driving 30+ min back home. No more unicorn macarons on the menu but they had THAI TEA MACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES that day.. Are you kidding me?! Vanilla ice cream with Thai tea drizzle, sandwiched between Thai tea flavored macarons. It was everything that my fatass self could have hoped for.. Thai tea incorporated into one bomb AF dessert!

They have other offerings that I really DGAF about.. Yum-ee buns (can't stand donuts), cereal milkshake concoctions, & an actual SAVORY menu? Ehh maybe one day.. But let's be real.. Macaron sandwiches are where it's at!

Anyway seriously though, if anyone has tips on how to eat the macaron ice cream sandwiches without looking like I just started learning how to feed myself, let me know.. I'll try it out on my next visit to Ninety's!"}
{"text":"Awesome little ice cream shop with specialty ice cream and deserts. They serve something that haunts u in ur dreams. 
I've been to this spot at least 12 times and each time is just like the first."}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwiches made with donuts?  Throw in your favorite childhood cereal?  The Spice Girls are playing on the radio?

I'm done... Just done... And in the best way yall.

I am obviously on a major dessert kick right now... along with Zinfandel.  My wife sneakily snuck me to Ninety's Ice Cream and Sandwiches a few months back and I ashamed that I have not yet been back.

I got their famous donut ice cream sandwich and added cookie crisp to it.  Kids, let me tell you the amazing adventure that my taste buds went on here.  They basically cook it in something that looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich cooker and out pops this softball sized icecream that is encased inside a donut.  The warmth of the donut against the cool, firm, ice cream is just a great experience for your mouth.  Not as messy as you would think either.  However, I really don't let food sit around long enough to melt."}
{"text":"Very nice upgrade to the store. So much more on their menu and my kids love it. Every time we go we get to enjoy the outside air and walk around the pond."}
{"text":"Macaron ice cream sandwiches?! Yaassssss! What a genius concept to take two delicious desserts and then smoosh them together. 

My mister and I went on a busy Saturday evening and there was a line to the door, but we persisted and it moved pretty quickly. I was worried that there would be slim pickings for flavor options but I was definitely wrong because picking which macaron was a hard decision! 

Some of the flavor options are more traditional like mint chocolate chip and some are more wild like fruity pebbles or the strangely named play doh. I really want to go back to try that one just by the name alone. Since it was my first time I decided to stick with something more classic - cookies and cream. Whew, was that excellent! Giant cookies and cream macaron mounded with cookies and cream ice cream and then topped with another giant cookies and cream macaron. 

The macaron was great, but not classically baked. It had the crunch of a macaron on first bite, but the texture was more along the line of a soft baked cookie. Regardless, it was so good. The ice cream also appeared to be house made with huge chunks of cookie in it. For ~$6, it was huge portion wise. My mister and I easily could have split one and been satisfied. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"MACRON ICE CREAM SANDWICH!
Yep, You read that right! Its bananas or better yet coconut or better yet caramel or all 3 at the same time. I got the Samoa Macron Ice cream Sandwich which was out of this world amazing. As you can see by the picture it was huge... H U G E. it was not your regular ice cream on a cookie. The macron was crisp on the outside and chew inside. I switched my ice cream to coconut to really highlight the flavors and it was out of this world amazing. The flavor of the ice cream was not soft and subtle but intense and powerful. There were drizzles of chocolate, caramel and additional coconut for enhanced flavor, texture and of course Instagram goodness (yes, I did it for the gram don't judge). It was literally one if not thee best sandwich that I've eaten. 

What I really enjoy to is that its close to the board walk which makes this a great first date location, catch up with girlfriend location, take the kids for treat location or I'm hiding from my s/o location. They have an assortment of other treats if your not feeling creative but I assure you once you see the Ipad menu. (got your attention huh) You'll be amazed and inspired by their creatively. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Donut meets ice cream in a heavenly medley! I got the strawberry shortcake bun and it was amazing especially because they heat the bun up! My husband ordered the strawberry shortcake milkshake with all he fixings and just watching them make it was cool! It's a little pricey for ice cream but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love coming here after some time at the park and feeding the ducks during the warmer months! The new renovations & menu is just perfect! I am yet to try something there that I do not like, and service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really disappointed with our experience at Ninety's. We had seen their instagram photos of delicious looking desserts and treats and so we made the drive from SW Charlotte to come check it out. What we got was not worth the money. The yum-ee bun was essentially a Hawaiian roll with ice cream and three pieces of cereal stuffed in it. Nothing to be excited about. The macarons were nothing special either. Please just save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We recently came here for a midweek treat. My fiancé had the vanilla milkshake with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and I had the cereal bun something or another with fruity pebbles. We both loved our orders and thought they were tasty. I gave my fiancé a good bit of my bun because I can't do too much dairy but otherwise, I would've eaten it all. 

What made this place amazing to me was the service. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. I noticed when they made my fiancé's milkshake and poured it in his cup, it was only 3/4 full and (without me asking or mentioning it) they took the time to make more milkshake to add to it. 

It was kinda pricey to me (our total was right around $13) and that is the only thing that kept it from being five stars. All around - this is a super unique spot with great customer service that is worthy of a visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite dessert place in Charlotte right now. I like 45 mins away and make sure to stop by as many times as possible. Ninety's is so creative, not to mention delicious! One of my favorites is the Macaroon Ice cream sandwich. It does not disappoint. I love how they change their flavors daily (Thai tea, strawberry shortcake etc) and always come up with unique creations!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!!! This is the best dessert place I have ever been too. So many options!! The service was superb and had so many recommendations for my first time there. Best part about it is , I work in the service industry/ hospitality and have been for the last 3 years and I KNOW how places get when people come in so close to closing time. My boyfriend and I came in 20-30 minutes before close and the staff was STILL so incredibly friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to ANYONE! And pray they never close down."}
{"text":"Heard about this ice cream shop from Pinterest and i am floored.The milkshake was the perfect consistency and wasn't overly sweet. Only thing i did not enjoy was not having a lid for my milkshake but it was only because i opted for the edible rim. I thoroughly enjoyed this cute little shop and definitely will be going back on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Definitely a one of a kind dessert place. They have so many different creative treats to try! I haven't tried anything that I don't like yet and you definitely get your money's worth the portions are huge! The customer service is always great as well they are so friendly and helpful! I would give this place 10 stars if I could it's my favorite dessert place and I HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has incredible ice cream desserts. We visited with friends, which was a great way to sample a variety of treats. We ordered the salted caramel french macaron ice cream sandwich...it was amazing! I love macarons the ones Ninetys make for their ice cream sandwiches are the perfect texture! We also ordered the Brownie milkshake and one oreo milkshake. It was a unanimous decision that these were some of the best desserts we had in a long time. The texture of the ice cream was silky smooth and flavors were on point, they know what theyre doing! The location is perfect too, because afterwards we took all the kids to the playground and for a walk along the lake."}
{"text":"This had been on my list for a long time, ever since they were first featured by Charlotte Agenda. I finally got to try it and I can't wait to go back now. 

We got the St. Pat's Day Lucky Charms macaron ice cream sandwich and the strawberry shortcake yum-ee bun. The ice cream sandwich macaron was amazing. Everything about it was perfect. The cereal in the outside added good flavor to the ice cream, the macaron was delicious, and the sauce was the perfect complement. It was huge, so I had to bite the top and bottom halves separately. The yum-ee bun was good, but it felt like the portions were off. Most bites all I tasted was strawberry ice cream, which was disappointing. They said this was their most popular item which surprised me because I thought the macaron was better. 

They also make cereal milkshakes and cookie dough pops which I would love to come back and try. 

I definitely think this place is worth driving up to the University to try out! I will be day dreaming of their delicious desserts."}
{"text":"My first time here. The ice cream was ok I suppose, would I make a special trip no. My kids had a cone each and I had a strawberry shake. My shake was nothing special it actually had a weird taste. When you walk in the staff seems friendly and weird. Friendly as in they speak to you weird as in they just look at you and expect you to know what you want. It was my first time and seem like a lot of others first time. I was looking at the menu and noticed a few others was for a while trying to figure it all out and the staff kept asking have we decided yet. Not once did they offer any suggestions it's almost like they assume everyone as been here before. For my shake and 3 cones it's was around $15 I suppose that's good. The place did pick up in business while we sat and ate. In conclusion would I come back ummm the jury is still out."}
{"text":"Updating this review, as the old Ninety's is LONG GONE, and the new Ninety's is my new ice cream go-to! The owners are incredibly friendly and super helpful when picking from the variety of ice cream (and cookie dough!) treats they have available. 

Their milkshakes are spot-on (for extra, you can add icing and toppings on the outside for that perfect instagram photo!), and their macaron ice cream sandwiches are messy, but delicious! I would highly recommend any of their cookie dough pops. While the location itself is off the beaten path (in University), it's worth the trip to try these unique treats!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I can't tell if I don't like it because of my poor menu choice or if it was just that bad.

They have macaroon ice cream and ice cream sandwiches made of apple fritters or donuts. They also had a selection of shakes and other items. I simply wanted to check out the ice cream. 

I got birthday cake ice cream in a cup. It literally tasted fresh out the generic carton. It wasn't creamy, rich, or fresh to me. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you just want ice cream."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake ice cream today from Ninety's Ice Cream & Sandwiches.  A co-worker was kind enogh to bring me a surprise flavor.  I had other opportunities to taste this flavor but passed them up.  You see, my mind says yes but my body says no.  I enjoyed the strawberry flavor with just the right amont of graham cracker crust mixed in.  Also, I heard more about the lunch items offered prompting me to make a visit to this location VERY soon!"}
{"text":"They have changed exponentially since my last visit about 7 years ago. This place is fantastic! Glazed donut filled with strawberry ice cream ,"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. Located on the boardwalk, one of the only walkable places in University.During my college days, I'm sure I had a sandwich here, once or twice, but I can't seem to remember. Last night, we stopped in as a celebratory first ice cream of the season.  I got one scoop of the coffee cookies and cream and a scoop of  the butter pecan. No complaints! if you want a sweet treat, stop by this place, grab a seat and enjoy some live music from the Wine Vault next door. 
Affordable, fast and casual."}
{"text":"So anytime I would take my son walking with me, I would reward him with a stop here for ice cream. I mean let's face it - exercise is not the ideal activity for a 7 year old boy. And he always really enjoyed coming here for a scoop of ice cream - so it was always a win, win for both of us. 

On my most recent visit, I finally asked to try to his ice cream. He had cookies and cream - it was so good. I mean it was smooth and creamy and not to sweet. So I said what the heck and went to order something for myself. 

Of course I went big! I went with the cookie monster Yummee Bun. Basically it is ice cream that is served in between a glazed donut with toppings. So the cookie monster was cookie and cream ice cream, oreos, chocolate drizzle and one other thing I cannot recall now. But after they stuff the donut, they take it to the back and put it in some kind of machine that makes it warm and \"glues\" it together so it becomes a warm delight. It was good. I mean it was really good. I would definitely come back for this. 

On all our visits, they are always friendly and serve you fast and quickly."}
{"text":"Talk about overwhelming!!! Oh boy when I seen all the pictures online and in person in the establishment I was lost for words like okay what do I get? Boring ole me ended up getting a strawberry shortcake milkshake with the special rim full of goodies added on the cup. Little did I know my milkshake was a hit! As I walked around panicking for napkins because I didn't want anything to melt, as the customers ooh and awed over my milkshake. Those macaroons they have their look really good I will be making my way back for those. May I add everything here makes for a good feature selfie!"}
{"text":"l can appreciate all the effort that goes into serving up ice cream and shakes that just begged to be Instagrammed. Whenever l happen to be in the area, which isn't often, the lines are near the door. Which isn't surprising given its location and the fact that no other ice cream shop in Charlotte has treats similar to this.

l went in expecting to get an ice cream cone, but noticed about 2 or 3 flavors missing completely out of the freezer. Other people had cones, and I'm super picky about what l eat, so I didn't hold it against them. l decided to go with the Unicorn macaron ice cream sandwich. It was cotton candy sandwiched between 2 macarons. l noticed it was a huge improvement over how they used to serve them, which was already made and packaged. Not so good because they crumpled a bit in the freezer. But now you get the sandwiches made after you order, which is much better.

My daughter had a milkshake as she always does. She didn't care for the excess of whipped cream, but i will say she's been spoiled from having shakes in Miami/NYC which are even more over the top. I asked her if she didn't have those to compare it to, would she have liked it more? She replied yes. I find the fancy milkshake scene in Charlotte a bit limited, but Ninety's is worth a trip. Plus the scenery outside of the shop with the lake and the ducks can't be beat."}
