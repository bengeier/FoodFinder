{"text":"I used to walk past Porta Bella all the time when I was in college, but never made time to visit!  I really enjoyed my first visit to Porta Bella. I met up with a mentor of mine for a Friday lunch. The restaurant was really quiet and I can see how it would be perfect for a date night... Romantically lit with high booth backs.  The lunch menu was limited to a few pasta dishes, some salads, and sandwiches. My companion ordered a salad and 1/2 portion of the hot cheese bread, which she said had been her go-to for years (a perfect portion, and just healthy enough...) I opted for the manicotti with tomato sauce-- two delicate rolls of fresh pasta filled with just enough cheese and spinach, baked in a flavorful sauce. It was a perfect lunch portion, supplemented with bread and spiced oil.   The price was right at about $10 with lemonade. It's what I'd typically spend for a sit-down lunch.  I look forward to going back! Oh, but watch your knees on the wrought iron table legs!"}
{"text":"Lovely garden seating. I was there on a beautiful summer day and they have tables with some shady trees around so it's nice even on a hot afternoon.  We only ordered a couple of desserts and they were both good. If that's an indicator, I'm confident the food is good too.   Unfortunately, they didn't have the garden seating open the last time I went there on a Saturday afternoon in late September. They said they don't open it when the the temperature drops below 60 or something.  Which was very odd because it was a gorgeous day and it was a very  busy weekend in Madison due to a football game.  The inside seating is more upscale and intimate inside.  Seems appropriate for a romantic dinner out."}
{"text":"Disappointed is the best way to describe the recent dinner at Porta Bella. This place used to be favorite of mine but it has definitely faded.   First, no one was manning the hostess stand when we walked in. After a few minutes, a gentlemen came to us saying that they were short staffed on this Saturday evening and didn't have a hostess. Since we had a reservation, our party of four moved to the bar for a cocktail. A single bartender was trying to handle both the table drinks and the people in the bar area. Once I was able to get his attention, he told me he could take my order as soon as he filled the dining room waitress' order and the orders for the two other parties in the bar. 15 minutes later he still had not got to us. Alas, on to dinner.  I ordered the lasagna and a small Porta salad. The lasagna here used to be the bomb. The salad was still pretty good but the lasagna was just plain blah. As others reviewers have said, mushy, flavorless and way too much sauces. The others in the group said meals were just ok, nothing special.   It is too bad the food and service have gone downhill. I really liked the atmosphere and decor of the place. It was always a good date night stop. Lots of other choices downtown so I doubt that I'll be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. a great patio for appetizers or drinks.   lets begin..   I'm in the food service industry so I tend to be more harsh and pay more attention to detail so take that into consideration while reading.   table of eight   TIMING:  8-10 minuets for water and bread on the table-to long  12-15 minutes for first round cocktails and wine -way to long  15-17 minuets for salads.-again to long  sampler platter dropped shortly after salads  28-35 minuets for entrees  we were \"that table\" that asked for separate checks and the server was kind enough to express that it wasn't a big hassle and gladly did the extra work for us. quickly and efficiently  QUALITY:  salads-plain dinner salads. fresh greens nice dressings probably not homemade  sampler platter-ravioli was freezer burnt . obviously a purchased product and not homemade. I've used these products in the past and actually like them a lot, as long as you keep an eye on the product and store properly. let them thaw at room temp rather than boiling from a frozen state and you'll see a big difference in end product. the stuffed mushroom were still raw, but the stuffing had good flavor but the entire sampler platter was not at proper serving temperature. putting cold food on a hot plate doesn't make the food hot.  the spinach salad for entrees was a great portion size, and had good reviews at the table(I personally didn't try it but it did look good.)   the majority of the table had the personal size pizzas. all were properly cooked great flavor, nice crust and good temperature. Unfortunately there was a mix up on mine and they made the wrong kind. the server pointed this out to me before delivery, served me the mix-up while the kitchen prepared the correct item and at the end of the meal, took care of the issue on the check.(Accountability and owning the mistake is huge to me. This is what will get me back in the door another time.)   the price point of the meal, drinks, and wine really good. Had a nice $25 bottle of red Zinfandel.   the pizza deal was close to $10 off regular price and it included a pint. If the got the word out on this deal, I would expect them to be packed on Sundays   Two stars is low, but I think w/ a little more eye on quality, and teamwork in the service department on larger parties to expediate cocktail service(and ma bey a new bread program-doughy-not properly proofed/baked maybe a day old?) this place has all the potential. I will go back, I love the patio and building, and the food is close to where it should be, but needs little tweaking here and there to make it exceptional."}
{"text":"I was VERY excited about coming to the Porta Bella.  It's been about 17 years since I was last here.  I remembered it was SOOOO good that I couldn't wait to come back.  Well, I found myself in Madison and HAD to return.  We went for lunch at 12:30 pm.   The front was exactly how I remembered it.  Beautiful walkway to the front door.  Walked in, there was no one except a cash register.  The place was very dark and no one was around. Made us wonder if they were open.  We walked further into the restaurant and finally saw someone.  We asked \"Are you open?\"  The hostess replied \"Yes\" & immediately showed to a table around the corner.  The dining room, even though very dimly lit, was very beautiful.  The hostess was very friendly and invited us to look around the restaurant.  We loved the secluded booths and the romantic atmosphere.  I could easily see this as a perfect date restaurant.   There was not much on the menu but then I remembered it was lunch and their dinner menu probably was much bigger.  We all ordered Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  The sourdough bread was warm and very good, especially when you dip it into the oil.  However, the entrees were so bland.  They were all lacking seasoning and flavor.  The chicken was so rubbery and it tasted like it was just cooked in the microwave.  Gross.  I could not eat it.  I had mushrooms added to the dish, which helped.  I was so disappointed after the entree.  This was once the high end place I couldn't wait to go back to...now it's a place that serves bland pasta.  So so disappointed.  Would I go back?  Yes, probably for a bottle of wine in their wine cellar but not for their  food....unless their reviews on Yelp greatly improve."}
{"text":"We came here on a saturday night for restaurant week in madison. I had heard good things about the place but then when I came to look at yelp the reviews were not so great. We decided to go anyway. The stuffed mushrooms were absolutely wonderful, a good little appetizer before the meal. I chose the lobster ravioli with half alfredo and half vodka cream sauce. THIS WAS AMAZING. Just enough lobster flavor to add to the meal but the vodka cream and cheesy alfredo sauce turned this dish into heaven. The others at my table had prosciouto and panna that was also very delicious and creamy. To top off the meal it came with dessert and we had the almond cake and tiramisu. Let me just tell you if you get any dessert in your entire life get the almond cake! It is the best thing that has ever hit this planet I want to bathe in it! Unfortunately they only get it in for restaurant week so maybe they can change that! We got our food very fast.  Our experience was wonderful, the wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful in choosing what to eat. You could tell they have eaten almost everything on the menu! The only down side of this experience was that there was an extremely loud table that complained about everything only at the end of the meal. This ruined the meal for many in the restaurant due to their insane rudeness and bargaining for discounts. I just want to say that if you can eat your entire meal without complaining there was nothing wrong with it! The wait staff handled them very graciously even though the rest of the restaurant wanted to kill them. I could not believe how rude they were. Please remember that waiters are humans too and have a very hard time when you scream at them for something that is basically your doing. The table proceeded to ask for multiple discounts and eventually did not want to tip. REMINDER: YOU MUST TIP YOUR WAITER. If you can afford to go to a nice restaurant then you can afford to tip.  Overall it was wonderful for our first time here. I would definitely come back for date night and even desert and a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"This experience started off extremely well.  The entrance of the restaurant takes you through gates that open to an outdoor patio adorned with ivy covered walls and rod iron table and chairs.  A really unique and peaceful setting in an otherwise busy area.  The entrance to the inside of the restaurant greet you with dark, warm colors and low lighting.  A great atmosphere!  The service and food were another story however.  We ordered wine, appetizers, salads, and entrees.  Our appetizers came out and were okay (Sampler).  The salads and entrees followed before we could finish any of the previous courses.  Felt very rushed in what seems to be a very relaxed and intimate atmosphere.  The Caesar salad was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  The entree, however, was aweful.    Chicken Tetrozinni (spelling??), boasted a rich cheese sauce over chicken and rotini.  I added mushrooms, which helped.  The sauce was about as rich as a freshman on the UW campus.  More like a weak alfredo than any kind of decent cheese sauce.  Not to mention, there was no (and I mean NO) flavor to the dish.  I asked for fresh cracked pepper, and they pepper mill was grinding out dust over my dish.  All-in-all, I give it a 2 star rating for the atmosphere.  But if you are going for a good Italian dish, there are better options within walking distance.  Too bad too. The restaurants design and atmosphere are top notch."}
{"text":"I have been to Porta Bella several times over the years.  Why I've gone there more than once I just don't know.  I just want so badly to like this place but every time it truly disappoints.  The only thing it has going is the semblance of a romantic atmosphere (although that's really only due to the low lighting).  My last trip I had the pasta primavera, artichoke and spinach ravioli in a pesto sauce and sauteed veggies.  The only problem was that there were 3 itty bitty raviolis in the entire dish.  Trying to find them was like an archeology dig amongst unfresh and limp veggies.    Next time you walk past the place do yourself a favor and just keep walking.  The sub-par food and service aren't worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Sub par in all of its courses that I had for dinner on July 25. Why would you even participate in Restaurant Week if you don't put your best foot forward. The best part about the meal was leaving."}
{"text":"LOVE the Porta Bella mushroom sauce and the outdoor dining!"}
{"text":"The food (I had the Porto salad, shrimp and scallop pasta, and the bread and oil thing) was extraordinarily bland, oddly and unpleasantly sweet, and completely without seasoning. The restaurant was freezing. Our waiter was as bland as the food (sorry, it may have been his first night).   The bread is clearly not baked in house, is largely flavorless, and the \"house oil\" that came with it is low-grade olive oil with red pepper flakes.   The Porto salad was a monstrosity of iceberg lettuce and flavorless cheese chunks with disturbingly crunchy chunks of \"meat.\" The dressing (I ordered the blackberry vinaigrette) was sugary, NOT a vinaigrette, and flavorless.  My entree was cold, but I will say that when I asked him to heat it up, it came back at a better (though still not ideal) temperature. Store-bought and very sweet vodka sauce, a splat of some kind of green herb on the side, but no flavor present in the dish. Not bad, but nothing special. The scallops and shrimp were cooked well!  Also, INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception dinner here (Fall 2014), in their new banquet hall (seats around 150 or so). Wow, dynamite staff, food, environment, and service all around. Can't recommend this place enough. Thanks Porta Bella for a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect spot for date night, dinner with friends or even a business meeting.  The layout of the restaurant maintains privacy for diners in defined booth spaces and the cozy old-world decor simply adds to the atmosphere.  In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.  You start to relax even before the waitstaff asks for your beverage request.    Whether you're visiting for lunch or dinner, the menu holds a diverse selection of Italian favorites and includes nightly specials for guests to enjoy.  The wait for the food is relatively short or seemed that way, due to the intimacy of the place.  When it arrives, it is high quality and very tasty.  I don't think you can go wrong with your selection!  Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.  I'll definitely be back for lunch, dinner or cocktails."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our anniversary and were highly disappointed.  The food had absolutely no flavor and the chicken in our dishes was very overcooked.  Olive Garden would have been a better choice and the service would have also been better."}
{"text":"The reviews of the stuffed mushrooms are right on; they're good. Anything with seafood in it (especially the shrimp) isn't very fresh (it is Wisconsin after all) but everything else is pretty fantastic. The noodles were great as was the sauce, the bread, etc. The interior is pretty dark and the patio area seems like it needs a little work but I'd certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week and I've never had such a terrible dining experience before. The food and service here deserves 0 stars, however, the restaurant's decor is elegant.  I ordered a blackberry salad for my appetizer and it was awful. The salad consisted of a few pieces of raw and undressed spinach, four blackberries, and sloppy hand shredded ham.   My stuffed sole over pasta was disappointing. You can't call yourselves an italian restaurant when you overcook your pasta to the point of no return. There was no seasoning at all on the food (which would explain the salt and pepper shakers on the table). The fish was overcooked.  My boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp. They gave him two mere pieces of shrimp and the supposed \"crabmeat\" stuffing was mainly breading. The funniest part was the sauce they decided to put on the plate. They served the steak with a huge portion of sauce in a little dish which tasted like mustard straight from the squeeze bottle. Why is that supposed to be there again? Had one poured that all over the steak, one's palate would be drowned in horseradish.   Dessert was mediocre. My almond cake tasted like a defrosted pound cake with reddiwhip on the side.   You've been warned. Olive Garden may be a better pick."}
{"text":"I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part."}
{"text":"Just not a fan.  I've been here several times.  To be fair, the atmosphere is really fun and intimate.  But the food's always mediocre, fairly flavorless, and the prices are way too high for what you're getting.  It's not an expensive place, but the food is really so-so.  Heavy on the salt and cream sauce.  Meh."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent. We came here looking for a nice outdoor eating experience and enjoyed their pretty courtyard. We'll certainly be back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever.  After 25 years of eating here, I know it has ups and downs.  But tonight was worst.  1. Ordered a bottle of wine.  Rather than traditional service for bottles, waitress set on table and that was it.  No tasting, no pouring.  2. Ordered appetizer/starter.  But soup and salad came before the appetizer.  3.  Tomato basil soup was more like tomato water sans basil, with big chunks of zucchini.  4.  Asked waitress to slow down the service so we could eat.  But then main course came before we could finish, soup, salad and appetizer.  At one point, two people had 8 plates on a small two person square table.  5.  One main dish was okay but other was nasty.  Meat was rancid and inedible.    Waitress came by once after serving the main course.  Diner 1 said okay since he had his first bite.  The other diner with the rancid meat was still eating first course and had not tasted main so could not offer feedback to waitress.  No additional table visits until time to bus the table.  6.  Right now Immodium is my best friend.  Threw up twice on way home from restaurant and now waiting patiently for anti-diarrheal pills to kick in.   What the hell happened here?  After 25 years of good dining (not excellent but usually pretty good), it is a train wreck in the kitchen and in the service."}
{"text":"The food was edible, but not incredible. Mind you, it's better than what I can make for myself, but it doesn't stand out. I honestly couldn't tell you whether or not it was expensive because UWIsc paid for our banquet.  However, the downstairs basement/dungeon/bar/whatever is a pretty fun place to hang out. The dining area can get cramped and difficult if it's reserved for large groups because there are big pillars that take up a lot of space. This makes restroom trips cumbersome.  But the flirty and good-looking bartender? He gets 25,000,000 stars."}
{"text":"I was looking for an Italian restaurant in Madison to take my girl for Valentine's day dinner. I finally decided to give this place a shot even thought I had read mixed reviews about it. Well...the place was absolutely beautiful. Very nice and clean...all around great, romantic, cozy atmosphere. Servers and the rest of the staff were very courteous and friendly. I had a reservation and was seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Now for the food...whack...whack, whack WHACK!!! I had lasagna...which I love and have had from dozens of places and hadn't been able to find a place with just plain bad lasagna...until now. I tasted nothing, the sauce was very runny, and the lasagna itself had a weird consistency(kind of like half cooked noodles). My girl had something that looked like burritos and apparently was just as bad. And the worst part of the whole deal is that shortly after having dinner there I got sick. I don't know if it was something in the sauce or if it wasn't prepared properly or if it was all the oil used in the food but it did not sit well in my stomach. I felt nauseous all the way until I finally fell asleep. If it makes up for anything, though, the lemonade was AMAZING."}
{"text":"I came with some out-of-town family, and overall, I thought Porta Bella was pretty bad.   First Impression:  Porta Bella kind of comes across as a hole-in-the-wall -- you could easily walk past it and not really realize what's there. I enjoyed the atmosphere (secluded tables, intimate lighting) and their separate rooms -- we were in the \"Rose Room\", although you would never know it with the million roses on the wallpaper.   Booze:  I had an Old Fashioned to start off the night, and it was pretty bad. Maybe I've just become spoiled to how other places make them (namely, the Old Fashioned), but I was pretty disappointed. The wine list seemed to be very small, although I don't drink very much wine so I was okay with that aspect. The wine that was paired with my meal was very good, however.   Food:  I had an overall decent impression with my meal (Shrimp and Scallops with Tomato Vodka Sauce), but my wife absolutely hated her meal. The seafood was cold and rubbery, the sauce was cold, etc. My review has been tempered to reflect her poor experience.  Overall, Porta Bella seems to be hit-or-miss. I want to give it another shot before I write it off, as I had an okay time, but my expectations have now been significantly lowered."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more.  I felt the service was good. Our waiter was somewhat clueless but still attentive   The food arrived quickly even though  they were busy and the bathroom was clean.  Unfortunately our food was bland. The sauces were tasteless."}
{"text":"This is a Madison must-try. The food above-average & the atmosphere is just something that needs to be experienced. Don't let the haters deter you! If you don't want to commit to a meal, at least check out the lower-level wine cellar bar!"}
{"text":"Madison's most quaint and romantic little italian bistro (there aren't that many of them).  Their wine cellar has a very extensive beer and wine list."}
{"text":"One of the worst Italian restaurants I've ever been to.   Food is terrible. It's American Italian and its worse than olive gardens. Need I say more?  Service was really slow. Pasta was not cooked al dente and was flavorless. Why oh why. Such terrible food at an otherwise beautifully decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday for lunch. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables of people, so they were pretty slow. While the atmosphere and decorations were great, the service and food left much to be desired. The service was awful. We were there 2 hours - on a Monday afternoon. We had to ask for refills on water before we even got our drinks, which came just a few minutes before our food. Drinks were decent. Appetizers were pretty good. Our main courses were awful. Just awful. I had asked if I could get my dish without a certain ingredient, which I was told no. I should have taken that as a sign that nothing is cooked fresh. The food was very obviously microwaved, the pasta was hard on the outside of the dish and mushy in the middle. It was absolutely disgusting. None of us finished our food, and we were starving! The waitress never asked us how everything was going, and was hardly at our table. We had a birthday guest, and mentioned this. They brought out a drink, which was a dreamsicle type beverage, that had a candle on the top. It wasn't lit, and when we asked for matches, they said they didn't have any. Why bring out an unlit candle? It was odd. The whole experience was just plain awful. We should have went somewhere else."}
{"text":"As Italian as the Olive Garden, this is an old Madison favorite, popular for big portions and a safe menu. There isn't a thing on the menu that a toddler would not enjoy."}
{"text":"Why can't you just serve good food? It is terrible. I have been several times, it is clear the food is microwaved, frozen junk. Just skip this place....don't be fooled by the great location and exterior . It is truly awful ."}
{"text":"The weather was perfect while my brother was in town so we decided we wanted to eat outside. While walking towards State Street we passed the courtyard at Porta Bella and thought \"Why not?\" The courtyard is walled in w/big trees and several metal outdoor tables and chairs.  We went inside to find the hostess stand. Inside is a dark warren of rooms. Looking around while waiting for the hostess I was conflicted between thinking \"romantic, old-time atmosphere\" and \"this place could really stand to be updated and refurbished.\" The bathroom in particular was dated.  We were seated outside. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. We ordered beer, cocktails, appetizers and entrees. We enjoyed the bread with oil, calamari strips, and spicy cheese bread. The soup was very tasty. I had the Cannelloni which was very filling. Nothing on the menu seemed to stand out as being particularly unusual but everything was flavorful and well-prepared. We left full and it felt like a decent value.  I would not hesitate to come back here if we were in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"As a native Madisonian I consider Porta Bella one of the cornerstone restaurants of city. It has been around forever and is part of the unique flavor of downtown. It has a really nice ambience and i used to enjoy going there in years past. That's why I was extremely disappointed  with my recent experience dining there. Basically the rating I've given is for a tasty salad & entree and mediocre dessert. The reason the rating is so low is because the service was HORRIBLE. We were seated promptly and from there the service went totally downhill. Our waitress was friendly but COMPLETELY clueless. What should have been a one-hour meal took THREE HOURS. The service was incredibly slow and the waitress put one of the entrees in completely wrong so the order had to be put in over again and one person had to wait for their food. But amazingly that didn't slow the dinner down as much as the waiting between courses. Our waitress clearly had no idea how to stay in touch with her tables, she disappeared for long periods of time. She would take simple requests for more water and would vanish for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. I would have thought this was a problem with the kitchen but just from watching our waitress i think the problem was her & not so much the kitchen. Although she was eventually apologetic about the wait I think she really was undertrained for her job and possibly the dumbest wait person I've ever encountered. She was friendly but just had no idea how to do things. It was pretty shocking. The service took so agonizingly long it was hard to enjoy the food, which was fairly good but didn't really blow our socks off. Overall, a very disappointing experience, especially since I consider Porta Bella a city landmark. I'm planning on contacting the management, which is something I've NEVER done before but I was THAT appalled by how bad our waitress was."}
{"text":"The best italian in Madison.  Service is great.  Food is so good!  Tonight, I had the Prosciutto and Panna-Shells in a cream sauce with peas, prosciutto and mushrooms and then baked with a Porta Salad.  My wife had a dinner sized Porta Salad.  Both were so delicious.  We have never had a bad experience and have never had bad food.  We go there for special occasions or just because!!"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant.  We couldn't enjoy the atmosphere though since they crammed everyone in the restaurant into one tiny section.  I agree with the comment about the food being a joke.  Service wasn't great either - lots of employees around but few smiles or greetings.  Don't be fooled by the looks of this place if you want to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. Atmosphere was pretty dark, but ample space to mingle with others on lower level. Staff were friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here for a wedding reception. That part of our experience was outstanding... very good food, appetizers, desserts, and a well stocked and staffed bar.  We arrived to the event early with another couple, so were looking forward to hanging out in the wine cellar. It was closed when we arrive around 5:00pm. When I asked if would open later, the hostess said the bar tender was late for work, but should open in 30 minutes. No problem! So, the 4 of us went to the main floor bar while we waited for the party to start. It was just the 4 of us and maybe 2-3 others in the bar.  The bar was \"staffed\" with 2 people. At first it seemed like maybe we caught them a little early, for the main bar tender didn't even acknowledge our existence. We gave her a pass, but after 10+ more minutes of being blatantly ignored, one of us finally said: \"Ahem! I think we'd iike to order drinks now\".  The bartender gave us a lame \"okay\" response, not even looking at us, then went back to doing whatever she was doing (anything but serving customers). At least 5-10 more minutes being ignored. Finally she took our order - at least 1 of the 4 of us. Took forever to get the first drink, in the meantime, the rest of us were hung out to dry another 5 minutes.  After reading several of the Yelp reviews, it appears that our experience is not unique. How disappointing! This place was a top favorite when my wife and I attended UW 30 years ago. The ambiance is still outstanding, but after our experience and the reviews of the food quality, I can't see coming back except for the wine cellar (if the staff reports to work)"}
{"text":"The only reason I won't give Porta Bella a 1 star rating is because they liquored me up and our waitress was a gem.  The food, however, tasted synthetic.  The chicken resembled something in a Hungry Man's dinner.  The breading was soggy and the taste was bland.  The pasta was cooked fine, however the sauce must have come out of a can.    Go to Greenbush if you want good italian food in Madison."}
{"text":"I adore the location and atmosphere of Porta Bella! The last time I went, the food was good but not worth the cost. I feel like Olive Garden has tastier dishes for better prices. I hope they revamp their menu because I'd hate to see this place go. I had a steak and crab stuffed shrimp. Nothing memorable about the steak and the crab stuffed shrimp had very little crab, mostly breading. The service and atmosphere were great though!"}
{"text":"Ambiance gets 5 Star's.  Service gets 3, unfortunately I have to give the food only a single star :(  This breaks my heart, as \"once upon a time\" the food equaled the ambiance in every way. True Italian \"grinds\" ( food) \"Just like Mama used to make\". The meals we had today for lunch were disappointing, and tasted much like it came from a box instead of Mama's Kitchen... Perhaps it was the limited lunch menu ... The bread served with the meal was soft white bread \" Italian \" style.. Not crusty with a good crumb (as in homemade) I wanted to love the cheese & spinach stuffed manicotti.. The contents of which were very cheesy and it was served hot from the oven, but the sauce lacked flavor and was border line bland... The spaghetti and meat balls was mediocre.. The best part of the meal was the birthday drink... It is a shame to see a Madison icon slip so far from where it once was...  Still one of Madison's most romantic date night destinations..."}
{"text":"Went for prom, food was very good! Only thing that sucked was bread was hard like a brick. The dinner meal was excellent."}
{"text":"The classic 'date' or 'romance' place on campus. Good food and always fun. The Cellar Bar is great place to get away from the craziness of State Street. Great little basement hideaway!"}
{"text":"A beautiful place for a romantic valentine's day dinner with my dear and special wife. The red baroque interior design created  the exact combination of sumptuousness and passion to get us in the mood for an elegant dinner for two. The server suggested a perfect red wine for our selected meal which complimented things quite nicely. Sitting in the fairy-tale like flowery outdoor garden added to our beautiful moment in time. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"This was a bad time. One of the worst bar experiences. Our bartender made us very uncomfortable (insisted on coming to out table, was just awkward, served us drinks and then asked us for ids, saying flags had gone off, it's hard to explain...he was just awkward and talked down to us in a really odd. It seemed like he might have been drunk)  A super drunk off-duty employee came to our table, asked us for marketing advice and then tried to get our friend to go to Cask and Ale.  So weird. Bad time. Will not go back. Would not recommend.   Maybe the food is good. Get takeout maybe."}
{"text":"We ate here in a family group of five, expecting the previous (apparently) menu that they had gotten to know and love. We were blindsided by something new. Despite my fiancee's constant talk of a tetrazzini, (12x in the car ride alone), she looked at me after tasting it and winced. I was unimpressed with the sirloin and gnocchi dish. Now I'm normally against steak at an Italian place, but the gnocchi looked quite good. The sirloin was overcooked and the gnocchi portion was tiny. Le sigh. Yet another Madison place I've visited with high expectations and been confronted with marginal food. I will say the service was average, not fast, slow or much to comment on."}
{"text":"The chicken pesto shells were SOOO good. Calamari strips, lasagna, and chicken Alfredo were great. Overall everyone thought the food was really tasty. I wish there was more information on the menu for a few items. The stuffed mushrooms have bell pepper (I'm really not a fan of peppers). The jambalaya has mushrooms in it (the person who ordered HATES mushrooms but was too Midwestern to say anything about it). The ambiance is cool but everything seems a bit old and worn. Overheard another table tell their server the food never disappoints. Service was great. Good wine selection."}
{"text":"MMmm....love this place.  My mouth waters thinking about the Pollo d'aglio....marinara sauce with goat cheese.....mmm!  Love the huge booths, I went there on a double date last time which was a lot of fun.  Don't forget to check out the downstairs wine cellar.  Tied with the King Street Tutto for best downtown Italian....wait, I changed my mind, Porta Bella definitely wins.  5 stars."}
{"text":"While the dark, cozy atmosphere is always cited as romantic, it's also a fun place to go with friends or for lunch for something different.  I highly recommend the lunch menu- about the same price as anywhere else ($8-9), but you leave with leftovers for lunch the next day too!  The atmosphere, service, and variety makes this a much more interesting place to go than Tutto or Ginos, for basically the same price and much more satisfying food."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would outdo its reviews, but sadly it didn't. I ordered the blackened tuna with rice and mango salsa. The dish was a huge disappointment. First, the tuna wasn't blackened or at least not in my opinion, it may be what they consider \"blackened.\" It didn't have much flavor to it either, I found myself telling those around me it tasted like sea water and must have not been marinated or seasoned enough after coming out the bag or whatnot. Second, how could you go wrong with rice? It seems they cook the rice then put it in the oven, I don't know if this is to keep the dish warm or what, but the top half of my rice was pretty hard and rough to eat. Third, the mango salsa sounded soooo good! It's pretty easy to make too considering you can throw in some mango chunks in some pico de gallo and voila! However, I thought my dish had a side of marinara, until I tasted it and it was the mango salsa. Luckily, their tiramisu was good and the place has some very nice decor that gives it a very classy feel, including the outdoor patio and dimmed lighting."}
{"text":"This is the place where good UW boyfriends take their girlfriends for nice dates, anniversaries and the like. For a sloppy college student, it's a chance to dress up and enjoy the quiet, dim ambience and great Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"We went there for our New Year's Eve dinner and boy were we disappointed. The atmosphere was a dark romantic setting, but one look up to the ceiling and you'll find discolored tiles and rust. The bathrooms, while clean, could definitely use major touch-ups. The faucets were covered with white hard water staining and crusted over. It was the bathroom that you'd find in a hole-in-the-wall bar. The woodwork had a worn look to it, whether it was intentional or just unkempt is unknown.  Now, the food. If you like frozen TV dinner lasagna, I recommend theirs. The noodles were mushy, the meat was gray and mushy as well, very little cheese, waaaaay too much sauce, and almost zero flavor.. it's like they knew it was mediocre and tried to cover it with the sauce (which was also mediocre!)  My wife also got the lasagna, as we thought it'd be a safe bet after reading some of the other reviews, and she agreed on every aspect. She makes her own sauces and could instantly tell it wasn't authentic.  Honestly, save your money, $18 for a microwave dinner is way too much! The Olive Garden would've been a way better choice, and we hate the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Come here for all of my friends birthdays. Food is really good, but it takes a while to come out. Service is pretty good"}
{"text":"Classic décor but that is unfortunately where the experience ends. Chef lacks basic knowledge, I'll leave it at that. Servers are very kind but don't understand the basics of good service...inattentive."}
{"text":"One star for a cool, retro decor.  One star for decent drinks.  Service was poor. Food quality not worth the price. Definitely not a place for large groups. The experience might have been better for a couple, small family dinner or a double date, but they are not set up for large groups. And the night we were there it was NOT busy. Most tables were empty... on a New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"We did arrive about 15 minutes late for our reservation and the hostess made sure to remind us that we absolutely had to be out of there by a specific time before she even showed us to our table. No problem. We understand that you have a reservation for the table after us, so you think that the waitress would have done everything to expedite us leaving. Nope. It took almost 45 minutes to get out 10 people's soup and salads. Since when does Caesar salad have olives, hard boiled eggs and mozzarella cheese? Another half hour later (we now have 15 minutes to eat) our entrees come out. My husband's crab stuffed shrimp had very little (if any) crab and... He found a vein in the second one. Needless to say, he was done eating at that point. Then there was my chicken rollatini... Not rolled, was missing most of the menu ingredients and it was cold. Most definitely not going to go back. Ever."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a Madison hidden gem. Great food, nice wine list. Very intimate setting. Ask for the Rose room, or the Fountain room. Get the Porta Salad, and have some bread!"}
{"text":"Haven't gone here in a long time due to the dirty bathroom.  There were ancient cobwebs hanging from the ceiling and it was unkempt and in disrepair.  I felt that if this is how they disregarded the bathroom they most likely disregard everything else.  I won't go back.  The food and the service was good.  But I couldn't get past the other issues. 1of 5 stars for a casual to mid level dining restaurant."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for a group dinner.  I have now booked Porta Bella twice for a professional dinner setting and they have been wonderful.  Highly recommend the food and service, as well as the responsiveness of the staff there!"}
{"text":"I went to porta bella's on a date. The setting is very romantic and the way the seating is set up makes it a more intimate setting. For an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta, it was okay...the feta cheese was over powering. I ordered the portabella mushroom fettuccine alfredo. My noodles were over cooked and the sauce was extremely bland. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I went with a couple of girlfriends to Porta Bella for one of their Birthday's during Restaurant Week.  We had a 6:45 reservation and didn't leave until 9:45.  The service was slow and not the greatest.  We got our bread after our appetizers.  When we order a bottle of wine it took our server forever to get it to us and then she didn't know how to open the bottle.  Once our main course came we all thought the dishes were bland.  There was no flavor what so ever and we had to use salt to try and eat it.  Having spent $70.00 my self I was completely dissatisfied and will never ever go back.  I know the other girls I was with spent at least $50.00.  They also will not go back.  I feel bad they had such a poor showing during Restaurant Week.  I over heard another group complaining of the same things as us."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about this \"restaurant\" is that the decor is vintage sweet like in a time warp in Italy.  The food is Chef Boyardee specials....It was totally awful and I've eaten there twice and there won't be a third for me....try Lombardino's instead---now that's a terrific Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING ambiance, in a city with so many calculated restaurants this place feels unique and truly genuine. The food is pretty good and super affordable, I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking to drink some wine while having a great and memorable night out with friends. This place is an established true madison gem."}
{"text":"The food is a joke.  I can understand if you like the atmosphere, but let's all get serious about the food."}
{"text":"We ended up at Porta Bella after our first choice was booked.  It started fine, but it went downhill from there...  It was HOT inside.  I'd say high 70s or 80.  I asked the server if they had a thermostat and she said \"Yeah, it is hot.\"  Something must have been wrong with the HVAC.  Others at my table ordered pizzas and seemed happy.  I ordered the lasagna from a recommendation. It was still cold in the middle when it was served.  It had a cool look inside, but overall we were not impressed."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place.  Used to come here with the parents when I was at UW.  Took my husband this time for a little walk down memory lane.  Of course it looks exactly the same.  And I absolutely love the old parlor feel.  Bar is great.  The food was yummy though nothing extraordinary and I was a little put off by the service.  Super friendly but we never got a napkin even after asking and when the waitress nearly dropped a platter of another table's food, one entree of manicotti tipped over onto her breast shirt, she spilled quite a bit of sauce on her bare arm (which I am sure was very hot) then tilted it back upright with some of that sauce going back on the plate.  It was a nice save and she remained calm throughout, but, she still gave the food to the customer.  Ick.  That definitely lost this restaurant a star."}
{"text":"We went with another couple to have a 'Best of Madison' experience since I have walked by Porta Bellas many times and told my wife I would like to try it some day. I'm just going to say it, great ambiance, good service, mediocre food and an OK price. You would be much better off going to Bellini's for an Italian experience. The food there is more authentic and the ambiance is just as good."}
{"text":"Just got back from an anniversary dinner at Porta Bella and I have to stay I think this place is all right but not anything to write home about. The staff was very friendly, and managed to walk the line between attentive and intrusive. The wine selection is sort of meh, but the bottle we had was pretty decent for the price (Shannon Ridge sauvignon blanc). The food is between decent and good (a little oily, but that's Midwestern Italian for ya), but more importantly, for its price it is a huge steal. As for atmosphere: the place is cozy and intimate. Some of the tables' conversations traveled, but the small booths are very private. And comfortable.  Overall, I would recommend at least trying it out.  EDIT: One of us got a bit sick the morning after. I would suggest avoiding any of the butter-garlic sauces. They are extremely oily (beyond anything reasonable)."}
{"text":"I've loved this restaurant since I was an undergrad at UW. I was worried because some of the reviews were quite negative. Nothing could be more wrong. Calm atmosphere. Efficient staff. Well timed meal. And on Varsity Band Concert night. I had the roasted veg & Gouda ravioli. Wonderful. My son had the lasagne, just as I remembered. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here post football with my UW student and a few others .The service was really excellent , very on top of details without being too much.  I can't say enough about the service. I think our server was named Liz.  The decor in here is worth the visit, very old school. I loved it. The food was very good; stuffed mushrooms were great, and we had several Italian entrees that really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food. Service a bit slow (after we were done eating took about 20 min to get ck).  I ordered jumbalya pasta. Was good. Served w meds shell pasta which I found an interesting choice. Fiancé got the mufeletta. Absolutely delish!!! Kid ordered burger and pretty sure it was a frozen patty. Tasted ok. Not great. Def stick w the Italian food. I really liked the atmosphere; but not necessarily 4 a sat lunch. I've always wanted to stop in and I'm glad I did. Next time I would like to go in the eve n get dressed up and order some drinks too."}
{"text":"This recent dinner was my third trip to Porta Bella.  The first experience we had I was actually quite impressed and we really enjoyed our meal.  This was about 6 years ago.  Then we visited again about 2 years ago and had a mediocre experience.  This past Friday, we were looking for a place to have a romantic dinner and Porta Bella definitely provides an atmosphere and secluded seating which provides this.  From the romantic/private standpoint, we got exactly what we were looking for, a booth for two in a secluded area.  The food is where I have really struggled over the past two visits.  First off, keeping in mind this is an Italian restaurant, they are very limited in their ability to accommodate any alteration to their meal .  They have a pasta combo, which by default comes with lasagna and chicken tetrazzini.  My wife, not being a fan of cream sauces, asked if she could simply get Spaghetti Bolognese instead of the tetrazzini.  She was told that everything is pre-portioned so that you could not swap.  Ok, whatever...she ordered the Bigoli Bolognese.  Because she's pregnant, she can't eat cold cut meats and asked if they could \"hold\" the meat on her salad.  We were again told this was not possible, because the salads are all pre-made.  This seems crazy for an Italian restaurant, to essentially have everything pre-made up.  As if pasta and sauce are hard to prepare.  Clearly they are not doing anything too special in the kitchen to prepare our meals.  In the end, the quality of the meal spoke to their effort in preparation.  The bolognese sauce was rather flavorless and my seafood tetrazzini was even less flavorful and nearly dry.  At an avg of around $15 per entree, I don't expect 5 star quality, but to be honest I could have gotten a better meal at an Italian chain restaurant and they would have been more accommodating in the meal preparation.  I would recommend looking at many of the other Italian restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"I can't say I care about the atmosphere...the main floor is very dark and it definitely doesn't inspire \"romance.\"  If you're self-conscious about how you're dressed, the lower level is more casual.  But the food is delicious.  I've been there a few times and tried different pastas and they're all really good.  The portions are large enough to have leftovers so it's worth the price.  Call ahead if you go during a holiday or a game day.  It tends to be pretty busy during then."}
{"text":"Tuesday date night.  We arrived before seven, without a reservation, and were promptly seated in a retro romantic booth. This place oozes old world, gothic ambiance. Dimly lit, red shaded sconces with dangly crystals and cushy booths.   We came for the pizza. Ultra thin crust and crispy. The 14\" hot stuff pizza (pepperoni, spicy cheese, banana peppers & onions) $21.00 can easily serve 4 hungry adults.   We each ordered a small porta salad. This is their signature salad. It arrives nicely chilled with a large amount of porta topping (a mix of salami, cheese and garbanzo beans) with your choice of dressing. It's large enough to share.  Fresh warm bread is complimentary and served with butter and a warm slightly spicy dipping oil.   The menu offers a nice selection of pasta which I look forward to trying on future visits along with sitting outside on their shaded patio with a pitcher of sangria.  Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant is okay; not bad, not good, just okay. The first time I ate there, I got spaghetti with a marinara sauce and it was marginal. It lacked any great flavor, or any flavor at all; I believe I added salt to it. The second time I ate there, I shared a pizza and nobody really had any idea as to what half the pepperoni was on, which I cannot have eat. I ended up biting into pepperoni on my non-meat half. Apart from that, the pizza was really good."}
{"text":"We came here after my sister-in-law's graduation today.  Unfortunately, Yelp is spot-on with this one.  Although the ambiance was nice - very cozy and romantic with the side booths, the food was a big miss.   The Caesar salad was decent, and the bread was delicious (and warm!) but the pasta (I had pumpkin ravioli with gorgonzala sauce) was a huge disappointment.  The ravioli themselves were ok, although a tad too sweet for my tastes, but the sauce on them was terrible - think cold, congealed grocery store Alfredo.   No hint of Gorgonzala at all.   My fiance did like his pasta, the bolognese with homemade spaghetti, well enough.   I thought it was pretty overpriced, especially for the area.   Pasta dishes were mostly $13-$15 and entrees $16+."}
{"text":"We took our parents here for a dinner when they came to visit Madison.  The weather was perfect so we were able to sit out on the patio, which was better than the inside.  The inside was a bit dark - I want to say they were trying to go for an intimate setting, but I wasn't sure.    The food was pretty good. I ordered a Mushroom Ravioli dish which was pretty tasty as well as the Porta Salad (iceberg and romaine lettuce with ham, cheese, red peppers, and other tasty things). The others at my table ordered a Pumpkin Ravioli (yum! would get this the next time we went), a Blackberry Salad (the kitchen ran out of Blackberries so cherries were substituted, which was delicious), a Meat Lasagna and Chicken Tetrazzinni (this was good as well) and Stuffed Chicken Breast (which was good but a bit heavy on the alfredo sauce).  Because two of us ordered food off the dinner special menu, we had a cannoli for dessert, which was delicious.  Overall, great food - I'd go again."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. We had to flag people down to ask for more drinks - even refills of water- and we waited almost 90 minutes for our food... with only a handful of other tables in the restaurant. Don't make any plans for after dinner because you will be in this restaurant the whole night. Only plus was hostess was nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"I quite like the place....their entrance is through a quaint-looking garden which sets a romantic mood. The ambiance inside is pretty nice. The food is good. Try the stuffed mushrooms. They can be pretty busy at times so I would call ahead."}
{"text":"I'm so sad how far downhill Porta Bella has gone since I was in college.  While the romantic atmosphere remains, the food is awful.  Our Bolognese smelled and tasted like Chef Boyardi:(  Our waitress was so spacey and disinterested we had to laugh every time she left our table.  I hope the owners can turn the menu around - I think they need rescuing by Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"I don't get all the haters. The food was all great. The fried calimari were nice big pieces and their 3 course meal to celebrate thier 50th anniversary was a deal and delicious. Service was great but it was a weekday so it wasn't super busy. If you like an old school italian evrionment, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"So glad that some friends and I stopped in for lunch, as I haven't been there for a while. The romantic atmosphere wasn't lost on us though! We shared some laughs and some friendly love for one another over our sandwich/salad combo lunches. The tables around us were filled with an eclectic mix of patrons. I had the garibaldi sandwich and side porta salad ($8). The porta salad was as good as I remember. The garibaldi was dry and not as filled with ingredients (meat, cheese and veggies) as I've had before. The bread was so dry and crunchy, that it shredded the top of my mouth (similar thing happens when I eat funyuns). Pretty disappointed today. I think that Paisan's serves a better garibaldi. I've had a couple of Porta Bella's pizzas before and they are pretty darn good. I was bummed when no one from my table decided to get one. I may have to skip the garibaldi next time and get a pizza. I have to stick with my mantra, 'Go with what you know'. Oso's Night Rain was a nice addition to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Horrible. Words fail me...took nearly an hour to get our entrees at 8 on a Sunday night with an empty restaurant, all of our orders were mixed up...ordered the spinach and artichoke cannoli thinking that was hard to mess up...inedible! The spaghetti also a Ragu level disaster. Terrible red and white wines. I don't know how this place is still in business!"}
{"text":"Awful. And any other word you can think of that crossed awful. I went with a few friends to Porta Bella on Frances St for restaurant week. I LOVE restaurant week and have been pleased with every other establishment I have been to that offers a filling three course meal for only 25 dollars. I looked at the menu before hand and everything sounded so stuffing---most of the dishes included a comestible that was \"stuffed\" so the pun was intended there. In addition, all the entrees sounded so rich and bountiful. And that's exactly what they were-- rich with age and bountiful of disgust. The first course wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't mind blowing on any level. I had a greek salad and the leaves were old and almost dusty tasting, I've had better salad at a franchise like Olive Garden (I hate admitting I go to franchises). The second course was even worse. I ordered a stuffed NY strip which was very very cold and nothing on the inside was melted together to create a \"stuffed\" feeling. The funniest thing was that the waitress handed us the plates with oven mitts on telling us to be very careful because it was hot. False. none of our dishes were above 60 degrees. Other members of my group had pork which was WAY overdone and ravioli that was barely covered in any sauce. You can only imagine how awful the sea food was if they can't even get their ravioli right. Lastly, for dessert, I had a chocolate mousse cannoli which was OK, but two others in my group had \"cherry stuffed\" cannoli's that contained absolutely no cherries. When we confronted the server about the lack of cherries she told us that it was basically a hit or miss to as if you got cherries in your cannoli. She went on to explain that the cannoli mix came out of a pipe that they squeezed. I understand how they are made, however, that wasn't the right terminology to explain to a group of already displeased guests as to why it was lacking it's biggest seller--the cherries. The atmosphere was completely outdated and there were gnats flying around. I would NEVER go back and never recommend this place to anyone, the only good thing about this experience was spending time with my friends. Save your money for Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I need to preface this by saying that the company was AWESOME! I love ya Kristen if you're reading this, I do.  And it was a blast getting to celebrate your birthday with you.   But other than that...   This place is rrrrrrrrrrrough.   1. A young server who couldn't make strong menu recommendations. 2. A negroni that looked like a shirley temple and tasted like nothing I wanted to drink. 3. The most flavorless... FLA-VUH-LESS chicken Parmesan I think I've ever eaten.  4. This weird noodle, the name of which I can't remember, that they're supposed to be known for but I can't forget soon enough. Over cooked, mealy, melt in your mouth like you don't want your pasta to do.  5. And honestly, overpriced for the quality and portion size.   This place reminds me of Caruso's in Tucson (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carusos-tucson#hrid:6nm_dN4voJ43v98n5IF3PQ). Also Italian. Also an institution. And maybe good back in the day?   Sometimes when things get older they age gracefully. And other times they suck harder than a six year-old on a jolly rancher.   I know these one star reviews are hard for folks to digest, but so is Porta Bella. When I think about my scale for going as low as I've done so here I think, \"is there any redeeming quality that would make it so I would return?\"   Methinks not."}
{"text":"This establishment actively works against improvements to downtown Madison. They are out for themselves, not the community."}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the reviews, the atmosphere is wonderful and romantic, the service was friendly and prompt, but my serving was small and the bolognese sauce was bland, certainly not like grandma made it"}
{"text":"The interior is kitschy and romantic...the food is water-logged, unfocused and well suited for a nursing home cafeteria.  Porta Bella does not invest the proper energy or passion to put out a quality product and I therefore will not exert any more of my energy in my review for them."}
{"text":"Growing up in Madison, I have heard about this place for years.  It is with that and Restaurant Week that my girlfriend and I ventured out there last night.  The environment was great, nice and cozy with a higher class feel. Great lighting and seating arrangement.  The service was good, nothing bad, but nothing spectacular.  However, the point of this was for the food. Sadly, that did not live up to the hype, not even marginally.  The bread and oil served as a precursor was incredible. The oil was infused with a nice spice that went great with the warm sourdough.  For appetizers, we had the Italian Stuffed Mushrooms and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  The dip was incredible, hot, gooey, with a crusty yet easily broken up bread. The mushrooms left much more to be desired.  Initially, they tasted like a pizza without a crust, but as I chewed, the pepper became overwhelming.  That was the first one.  After that, I could scarcely taste anything but pepper.  Our entrees were a stuffed steak, what I would refer to as a Steak Parmigiana and Stuffed Shrimp with Spinach Fettuccine. The marinara with the steak was ok, most likely homemade, but the steak was overcooked to the point of being tough. And overall the dish was rather bland, even with the sauce and cheese.  The shrimp dish was no better.  The shrimp itself was good, but the stuffing and the white sauce both had little to no flavor. What little flavor that they did have was from the pasta and the shrimp.  The pasta itself was very good, as long as it was sauce free.  It had a great texture, was cooked perfectly, and made me think it was made in-house.  I did not eat most of this dish, which is nearly unheard for me.  Then we had our desserts, a hazelnut gelato with a cream center and a chocolate cannoli.  Both were good, but nothing to rave about.  The cannoli's filling was very rich and it almost made itself less appealing the more I ate.  I'm a chocolate fiend and have had varieties from many countries, so this was new to me.  The cream center of the gelato was a great addition, but was offset a bit by the overabundance of cocoa on the outside.  Again, neither was bad, but they fell short of memorable.  This meal was mostly bland really.  Short of a couple highlights, it was simply a below average meal.  The one thing that I'd never think of Italian cuisine is bland. Even if you're not a fan of the flavors, they are always there and always intense.  That's part of the draw.  For Porta Bella, it's character-lacking food has persuaded me to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're someone who wants to enjoy some delicious pasta AND feel like you're in a Wes Anderson film, this is the place for you (and me). It is dimly lit and beautiful. The service was perfect and our food came quickly. Absolutely zero complaints here!"}
{"text":"Not good. How can you mess up noodles with cheese?! Unappetizing pasta came with a tasteless salad with bottled dressing. Slow service."}
{"text":"I went to this overpriced \"Italian\" restaurant last night and although I enjoyed the atmosphere and romantic ambiance of the restaurant and the service was fine, I found it really a big disappointment food wise.  The cesar salad was iceberg lettuce, mozzarella and store bought croutons.  My mushroom ravioli (which now I realize were $2/piece for a total of 6 ravioli) were boring and tasteless with again, a boring tomato sauce.  My husband's lasagne was $f15 for poor quality lasagna with the same boring tomato sauce over top.  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Madison is not a great Italian food town, but there are certainly better choices than Porta Bella, which serves up uninspired versions of  standard checkered-tabecloth Italian dishes for $15-20 an entree, in a dim room that looks like an abandoned Legion hall.  Nowhere close to Osteria Papavero or Lombardino's -- to be honest, the food here tastes pretty much the same as the meatball sub I can get at the FIB's cart for 5 bucks."}
{"text":"I love Porta Bella's.  I think the food is really delicious and reasonably priced.  It is a bit dark in there, but is good for a romantic date.  I made the mistake of having a first date there and it was way too dark.  Save it for more intimate occasions if you're only going with one other person."}
{"text":"It was \"eh, alright.\"  My husband and I went for a late dinner, around 9:30 pm on a Saturday.  We ordered a bottle of the house chianti. That was delicious. He ordered the New York strip and I ordered the pumpkin ravioli with gorgonzola sauce. The steak was juicy but maybe a bit too peppery for us. The pumpkin ravioli was alright. I think that it was microwaved (the food burnt the roof of my mouth and the edges of the pasta seemed dry) but I may be wrong. The sauce was yummy for the first few bites and then I think that it masked the taste of the pumpkin a bit."}
