{"text":"Went here a while ago for a chicken shawarma with some coworkers and I have experienced much, much better.

Restaurant size:
It's a comfortable size, and definitely has enough seating if you're just waiting for take-out.

Portion size:
The chicken shawarma was disappointingly sized, and we all ended up getting something else at our cafe.

Service:
Unfortunately, there was only the one lady preparing shawarmas for 7-8 of us. Because of this, it took around 45 minutes, quite a bit longer than expected. The cost of our simple meals were appropriate.

Food quality:
Despite having \"the works\", the chicken shawarma was disappointingly plain!

Final thoughts:
I can't comment on the kebab plates or shawarma plates, but if the simple chicken shawarma could put me off to the restaurant I'm not sure I'd go back to try."}
{"text":"Fred's d√©cor is unfortunately as bland as their shawarma. The walls are all white and the only real colour in there comes from the printed menu above the counter. Aside from shawarma's are the shawarma plates, gyro plates, $2.99 falafels and various kebabs. The small restaurant is run by a kind Persian couple.

The chicken shawarma I ordered contained lettuce, pickles, radish, tomato, green peppers, tahini and hot sauce. Overall it was seriously lacking some real flavour. The chicken tasted very light as though it was moderately seasoned, the wrap could have used a proper garlic sauce and or pepper sauce. 

I HATE writing less than par reviews on Mom and Pop shops, but I hope they do come across this Yelp and make some adjustments to their cuisine. I would highly recommend introducing a delicious garlic sauce, pepper sauce, or even Panini pressing the shawarmas. I always think that if I ever opened up a restaurant, whatever food I would be selling would be the best of that cuisine around. Fred's has the potential like everyone else."}
{"text":"Fred's has a new name: Royal Kebab.  Menu and photos were retained. Referring to the review a couple of years back, this place may have been revamped dramatically because from my experience here's what I have to say.

I just love holes in a wall with great tasting and cheaper food to offer.  Royal Kebab is one of those great finds. It's much of a take-out place so don't expect fine dining nor posh interior.

Our favourite take-out order would be any of their Kebabs at any-given-weeknight-craving-for-Persian-food.  Meats are tender and juicier with that authentic Persian way of grilling, and their basmati rice is so delicious even without the garnishing you'd usually find in finer Persian places.  

Every meal comes with the meat, rice, vegie salad, and dipping sauce and each serving is very flavourful and big enough to fill any appetite. Two skewers of beef on a platter of salad and generous rice serving at $6.99, I'm practically good with that!  But I'm more of a chicken person and that chunky skewer of breast is so good even at $2 more.  I had to specify grilled tomato as alternate to sauce upon ordering, though. Apparently, that delicious siding is not standard item.  They offer \"extras\" at 50 cents each.

(Note to self: I'm not too sure how French fries fit the picture of a \"Healthy Persian Grill House\" but who am I to say.)"}
