{"text":"- Afternoon tea until 6pm - Lots of choices - Price reasonable - HK style taste on food and drinks"}
{"text":"This is my first time to visit. Me and my friend ordered a ham and egg sandwich,homestyle congee, cutlet with salad,and fried turnip cake. The best is the congee in that it's been put some seafood and vegetables, which reminds me of home-made food. If i have a chance again, I would like to order only congees. HOWEVER, the biggest problem is how to pay. They only accept cash without any notices. We tried to find an ATM ..unfortunately nowhere at all... we feel if it is for only cash, they MUST post some notifications. Eventually, my friend went back home and came to the restaurant again with cash... how ridiculous! !!  It's a disappointed moment at Ming's"}
{"text":"I have one friend that likes this place and another friend that hates it.    I lub HK style cafe but this place is probably the worst.  The service was ok and the prices are great, but the food was really bad.  I have been here a few times and I'm always disappointed.  Regardless, the place is always busy; so maybe it's just me?    The last time I was here, I ordered the baked Portugese chicken with rice.  The sauce was 'meh', but the major problem was that under all that sauce the chicken is flavorless and the whole plate of rice becomes a platter of soggy rice with flavorless chicken.  The chicken isn't even baked well enough to serve =\  If you're just want a quick bite for a low price, this place isn't too bad.  But if you're craving for hk cafe food, you'll probably be disappointed.    Cheers."}
{"text":"Afternoon tea time! I tried this new thing - red bean French toast. It was delicious. The toast was thick and crispy on the outside, inside are soft red bean filling. Plus the butter and syrup on top, perfect! Pairing with a cup of strong HK milk tea, very satisfying afternoon break. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea with a friend, and I was seriously craving for some HK style french toast. We ordered the one with condensed milk and peanut butter, $3.95, and it comes with a hot drink or add $1 for cold.   Let me just say that if I'm ever craving french toast again, I'll be coming here! The toast was huge. And the amount of peanut butter with condensed milk was just enough. Initially I had asked for more syrup, but the waitress said this one doesn't come with syrup. Sad at first, but once I tasted it... it definitely didnt need anymore. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast four times a week.  $4.75 you can get noodles and sandwich also HK milk tea.  My Fav: HK Baked Pork Chop Rice and  Hong Kong style milk tea."}
{"text":"HK Milk Tea = Garbage now + Price increase $1 to many specials and dishes (ridiculously expensive now, daily lunch special is $8 and most $6 special are now $7)  Just to let everyone know who goes to Ming's for their pretty good cup of HK Milk Tea that since about 3 weeks ago, the good milk tea maker is not working there anymore. I go to Ming's to eat 3 or 4 times a week and their milk tea became garbage about 3 weeks ago. (either too much milk, too weak, too rough on tongue or just taste like crap) One of the employee said the old good Milk tea maker is working night shifts, but i don't go there to eat a night and i am not sure if its true."}
{"text":"I love the HK cafe feel at this place. Everything I had was delicious, especially the congee and HK iced milk tea. Definitely coming back because of awesome and affordable food.   I only rated 4 stars because of the customer washroom, I won't go into detail about it. Just make sure you don't want to do number 2 there."}
{"text":"Came to Ming's Café wanting something quick and cheap. I ordered the plain wonton soup, and my friend ordered the peanut butter French toast. The wonton soup was very mediocre; you can tell that the ingredients used weren't fresh. There were very little shrimps in the wontons, and all the wontons were very salty. But again, what did I expect from a \"quick and cheap\" café. The peanut butter French toast that my friend ordered was okay, the toast was friend and it was drenched in kind of oily liquid. Overall, nothing special, and I should mention that there are better HK style cafes that offer better food for the same price point."}
{"text":"Good place for some quick and cheap Chinese food. I only come here for afternoon tea since it's until 6pm.  Service is okay, nothing special. You just get your food, eat and leave.   Just an average place lol for a lack of a better word."}
{"text":"Love the HK cafe vibe here, so homey. It can get pretty busy and slow here during meal time, so coming here for the afternoon special is not a bad idea. I love there HK style breakfast like macaroni with egg and ham and French toast. My favourite is their baked rice and spaghetti, the noodle soups are great too. Portion is always more than enough. Great place if you are not in a hurry, come here to enjoy a cup of milk tea reading news paper or catch up with friends while your order is prepared. No stunning food but definitely satisfying.  There hot sauce is just as good as the ones from congee queen, more crunchy and less spicy tho. Highly  recommended to have some with your baked rice or fried rice, perfecto~"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Saturday Feb 4th at 1pm.  Met two friends and we ordered different dishes. The only common item we got was the HK style tea.  What do you know, we all got food posioning the very next day.  If you got it too, let others know!  If you know anyone at BlogTO, let them know this place needs an inspection.  My friend missed out on the Superbowl festivies and I can't go into work for the next 48 hours.  Very unfortunate but contamination is a serious issue.    There are tons of amazing chinese restaurants in the area - just not worth eating here; don't risk your health."}
{"text":"This noodle place serves Hong Kong style breakfast. We came on a Sunday morning. The place was busy, but we were seated right away. Service was prompt and friendly. They have a nice variety of menu items ranging from congee, noodles, to breakfast sandwiches. We tried a variety of items. French toast - was good. It's deep fried, so don't eat it often. We had a pineapple bun. The congee was excellent, I especially liked the flavor of the minced pork in the minced port/duck egg congee. The congee comes with a choice of sides. We had the radish cake. The noodles with beef brisket was excellent. The ramen and luncheon meat was as expected. The western style meals all come with a choice of coffee, tea or soy milk. My favorite is the HK style tea."}
{"text":"Authentic HK style food with lots of variety. Personal favourite is their oven cooked beef and cheese spaghetti. Extremely fast service, albeit they are a bit impersonal but my food comes quickly and is exceptionally well priced. Great cheap eat!"}
{"text":"good priced HK style food.  we ordered home style vermicelli and shrimp and lobster sauce.  sadly they only accept cash as means of payment (hence 2 stars off).  We went on a Saturday during their lunch hours and it was packed.  Don't expect great service from the staff unless you happen to speak the same language as they do.  They messed up our mango slush order and served us an green apple slush instead..we returned the green apple slush and waited for the mango slush.   Their portioning to price paid isn't great.  For both of us the 2 dishes we ordered and we paid over $20 before taxes and we still were not full.  They did get the taste right on the home style vermicelli, tho the shrimp in lobster sauce was a bit too salty for our taste.  Due to no debit available not sure if we shall return or not.  We try to use home style vermicelli dish, mapo tofu and yeung chow fried rice as our gauge dishes if we intend to return or not.  4.5 outta 5 on the home style vermicelli, could have used more ingredients tho.  Used to having shrimp, squid, char siu pork pieces, scrambled egg and scallions in home style noodles.  There was no squid in their version."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot, it's very good for the price and quality. They advertise wifi, but it doesn't work even if you can connect to it"}
{"text":"Typical HK tea cafe restaurant with a rather large number of menu items.  I had the tomato sauce baked seafood rice set lunch, which included a drink (HK lemon iced tea was my pick) and a borscht soup (the HK tomatoey variety, not to be confused with the Russian borscht soup which is made with beets), for $7.95.  It was ok - good but not overwhelmingly good.  My aunt had the Singapore (? - looks like it was stir-fried with curry powder) kwai teow and it was pretty good - tasty but not overly oily and the texture of the kwai teow was just right: not too dry and not too overdone/soggy.  I should have had the fish ball noodle soup ($3.95 for a bowl) - just a feeling that the Chinese menu items are probably better than the \"western\" style stuff (baked rice, pasta, etc.).  The HK lemon iced tea was very good though (good tea flavor, not over sweetened, with good amount of fresh slices of lemon).  This place is great for afternoon tea (light snack) and for late night bites - reliable HK food on a budget.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I recently gave Ming's another try after a couple of bad experiences, and I must say that my impression of them has gotten much better. Prices are fair, food is served quick, and there's a lot of menu options to choose from.  Russian borscht with braised beef, served with pasta and side of bread - This dish exceeded my expectations. The soup was delicious and the portion was generous. The bread was warm and buttered, just the way I like it.  Fish ball noodle soup with side of fried fish skin - Can't go wrong with ordering this classic dish. Have it with their \"secret\" chilli oil that's apparently for sale in a container.  Fried chicken steak with mushroom sauce - Normally I don't like chicken steak because it can be dry, but this was pretty good! The mushroom sauce also made it taste extra delicious. You can get fried chicken/pork chop/steak with a variety of sauces to choose from such as onion, garlic, and black pepper.  Overall I was very impressed with the food this time! I find myself still wondering how I could've had such bad experiences in the past that's stopped me from coming. Nevertheless, I'll be back and hopefully the food stays consistent with this time."}
{"text":"Tip: this place isn't a Noodle House, but a HK cafe.   I finally came here after having it on my bookmarks for the longest time. Glad I did. This is one of my preferred HK cafes now. Ordered the Portuguese beef brisket and it was really good. Generous serving of great tasting chunks of beef brisket. The \"Portuguese\" sauce was really good as well. Price was reasonable. Milk tea was tasty as well.   My wife ordered what sounds like a pretty gross dish (IMO)... instant noodles + spam (that's my name for it). It actually looked and tasted pretty decent too.   We got here right at 12 on a weekend, and just had a short wait. But the line had  grown quite long by the time we left, so I'd try to beat the rush times in future."}
{"text":"Great for brunch, service is fast and you pay for what you get.   Context: loud and obnoxious din of Chinese people munching away. It is a very popular watering hole and sometimes there's a wait of a couple minutes for tables to clear. It isn't uncommon to share tables with other people in the interest of space and time.  Cheap and fast meals, offers free Chinese newspapers if you're into that sort of thing.   Breakfast combo from 8-11 with a mixture of western style breakfast + Chinese noodles for 5.75 plus a drink.   Cash only."}
{"text":"Went to Ming's and at 1:30pm on a Sunday there was still a lineup waiting for a table.  They handle crowds very efficiently, so we were seated in a booth within 5 minutes.  Frankly quite disappointed with this visit.  Have been here before and it was OK, but this time the dumplings and noodle soup was surprisingly inferior.  The shrimp filling was hard and seemingly overcooked and the broth and noodles were mediocre.  My wife's Portuguese style chicken and rice was also sub-par.   Milk tea was good, but not as good as what we had last week at Kam Fai 38.  Service was efficient and seating was comfortable."}
{"text":"My family are regulars so I feel we do get special treatment! This place is so busy especially breakfast time not expect to be treated fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I use to come often and was a regular here, so I knew everyone that worked there. Their dishes use to be mad cheap AND taste awesome. I stopped going for about a year because of work, then decided to visit the place again.  I took a look at the menu and was thinking, \"what the f? How come the special meal cost a $1 more? Mother f!\" I thought about it and said to myself, \"it's ok, inflation happened!\" I was ready to order, but no one came. Lo and behold, one of the ladies came (short hair, vulgar language - worse in chinese). Wasn't expecting attitude, but since I wasn't here for a year, I was in for a lot of fun. She took my order (with attitude) and gracefully walked away.. I wanted to sack her from behind so badly. My food came and it was great as usual, but my drink didn't (came with meal). So I asked the same lady to follow up with my drink. Obviously, didn't seemed like she gave a crap.. So I kept bugging her (at least 4 times) until she got really fed up and actually did something.. The whole time I was watching her server other customers and I was waiting for one damn drink that only takes 30 seconds to make.  Got my drink, paid my bill and left 10% tip (like all Asian restaurants, unless unless service was exceptional)..  Back it up.. Before I left, I shot my complaint to Billy (guy sitting at the counter) about this lady. She was rude, non compliant and also the food was great.  Two weeks later, I visited Mings after Allan's bakery and.. Balls, I didn't see her! Either she left, or Billy did something or it wasn't her shift.. If I see her again, I'm gonna ask her to serve me.. Hhhehehehhehehe  FYI, regular fried chicken wings is the bomb.. And the regular French Toast (not the Asian one) is so thick, you won't be able to stuff it by yourself.. Unless you're truly beast. I recommend you eat the French Toast alone or if you're having something else on top of the toast, SHARE IT! :D"}
{"text":"Large selection and good food at a decent price. Love the flavourful fish cake laksa and the taiwanese toast for afternoon tea all for ~$10 and comes with a drink (of course).  On another note, I'm not sure why there's complaints about the service. I've never had an issue with them. They come take my order, I get my order and that's it. Once in a while i'd have to ask twice but it get it - they get super busy sometimes and can forget. This place isn't about the service. It's about the food and the price. If you're looking for good service, try an O&B restaurant and pay the price."}
{"text":"I've been here lot of time but not breakfast. I order the egg Mac and egg omelette with mushroom. The Mac was too soft and the omelette is too oily. Also too many people for 8:30am. I like to be more relax in the morning. For breakfast definitely there are better place then here."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Cafes.  It's a cultural topic in itself.  Each person has their own HK Cafe that they belong to.  HK people no matter how they love to explore various Food cultures and new places, they will always have the local default Cafe(Cha Chan Teng) they call their own.  Finding your own Cafe is like finding a BFF.  A casual place you feel comfortable talking bullshit at extreme decibels while enjoying smooth, hot and flavourful Milk Tea, Coffee or Yuanyang along with HK eastwest fusion style fast inexpensive meals/snacks.  That's why once you find that special HK Cafe, you will stick with it too.  As for me, I'm still in search.  Weekend Special 15) Beef Tenderloin w/Mushroom Red Wine Sauce($13.99)  Took awhile to get this compared to all other Food selections my friends made.  My friends were finishing their Meal when I got mine so I had to supersonic my consumption.  I got the job done on a decent sized Tenderloin cooked medium as requested."}
{"text":"I would say this is a go to place for quick, cheap, and good hong kong style diner food. I normally come here for a quick dinner. The portion size is big, depending on what menu you order from you get a drink and soup with you dinner."}
{"text":"Came here at 6PM for dinner and the place wasn't busy at all. I ordered the Corned Beef Sandwich but they got my order wrong. They gave me a corned beef sandwich with egg instead. Taste is pretty Ok.  My BF got the ribs in house bbq sauce and spaghetti meal that comes with soup, garlic bread and a drink for 10.95. Serving is huge and one thing that makes this place stand out is the flavor! The ribs are fall off the bone and tasty! I am very suprised! Spaghetti is a bit bland but the ribs provide all the taste.  I am really liking this place so far. Though the servers don't speak English very well and they got one of my orders wrong, the flavor and cheap price has guaranteed my next visit!  I will be coming back to try their brick toasts next time. This place is better than Metro square cafe in my opinion."}
{"text":"Longstanding Hong Kong cafe is known for its variety, and they've got me hooked into their Portuguese sauce.  What I Got: Beef Brisket in Portuguese Sauce  First off: Portuguese sauce is a bit darker here and has a stronger flavor than most other restaurants from what I remember.  The beef brisket pieces were mostly lean and in general not tender enough; however there were a couple of fatty pieces at the bottom which tasted great. To be honest, I think that they indiscriminately just throw in the meat. The sauce redeems the dish though, and I might be trying this with chicken next time. The beef brisket had skin on.  For $11.45, it was good but not spectacular.  I would be remiss not to give a shout out to their lemon honey tea. At a time where I'm used to restaurants cheaping out on honey and lemons, this was a pleasant surprise. For once, I think the $0.75 charge was someone justifiable.  The baked Portuguese sauce meals came out incredibly hot and I finished the meal sweating. This is going to be somewhere I go more often in the winter!"}
{"text":"Sticky tables. Got a pork cutlet with e fu noodles in soup. That was an interesting combo. I prefer my e fu noodles a little less chewy, but all in all, a pretty good meal. Bonus points for the delicious chili oil."}
{"text":"A popular busy HK Style Brunch place in Scarborough. It is usually one of the hotpots for people to get good cheap HK Style brunch food here. It's usually quite busy during the weekends where there can long lines that stretch out the door. They have quite the selection of different dishes and the menu is quite extensive. The prices vary but is super cheap for what you pay for as they give fairly generous portions of food. Prices range between $2-$12 for the different dishes and drinks. I came here and order the baked pork chop with cream sauce to go with the noodles which comes with a daily soup and a drink so I ordered a cold HK style milk tea. Food came out relatively quickly. My meal came out rather quickly nice and hot. The pork chop taste great with the crema sauce, pork chop cooked right and the noodles were alright. Overall, decent service, cheap food that's good. Definitely one of my go-to spots in Scarborough for brunch."}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong style fast food type restuarant. I usually come here if I need to go somewhere early and need a quick bite. It says it opens at 8:00 am, but i've eaten here at around 7:45 am. Their $5.95 combo is quite cheap. You choose any style egg with either bacon, spam, ham, or saussage and then combine it with a noodle soup. This combo comes with drink and toast. Pretty cheap and filling. Service is fast and the servers are usually too busy to smile. They give out free newspaper in the morning. They can get really busy in the morning with large groups and take outs. When that happens they most often mess up your order, but they fix it quickly. They also have hong kong style lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner."}
{"text":"Packed on a Saturday morning and it wasn't even 9 AM yet!  Nothing special in terms of inside decor. Points go to the food (we needed a quickie crunch, munch, slurp - so congee, fried dough sticks, and pan fried radish cakes it was!). Portions aren't big but the taste is there and the price is very reasonable. Bonus points to the servers. Ample servers there providing swift and courteous service for the patrons.  Would probably go back and possibly try something for a later time to see how it is."}
{"text":"This place is relatively new to the area so it was a must-see. Just south of steeles Ave on Kennedy road, Ming us one of many Chinese (HK style fast food cafes) that stirs up from your typical Chinese and westernized breakfast to fast food lunch and dinner options such as hot pot, and meat/noodle/rice entrée.  Each special order will usually include soup and a hot drink at a very affordable price.  When we first walked in, the place was packed, though busy, clientele kept on moving in and out like cattle due to the fast and efficient staff that was on hand.   We were quickly seated and our orders were taken after a few minutes of scanning the menu. After it was all said and done, I ordered their beef hash with potatoes,  eggs and a sweet bun (rather than toast) presentation, portion and price was well worth it. Though the potatoes were sautéed more than usual the overall dish was satisfying.  To top off the meals, our HK style milk tea was a nice way to end it off.  Overall place is a gem if you're looking for a decent meal that won't break the bank that's quick and convenient."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The servers are super nice, and in terms of atmosphere it has strong homey, cozy feel to it which I love. The dishes are in huge portions and taste delicious. I recommend you give everything a try, as it's delicious. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Come here for the HK style milk tea. Hot or cold, it's really good.  We usually come here for a quick breakfast. Like Hollywood Cafe, they have combos for $5.49 where you get eggs and toast, noodles, and a drink (add $1 for cold). Admittedly, their food tastes a lot better than Hollywood café, but their plates and dishes all have an unappetizing bleach smell to them.   Most of their food tastes okay and its super cheap, but the bleach stench is a huge turn off."}
{"text":"Was up bright and early at 8am in Markham. And was looking around for eateries that were open. Drove by and saw a bunch of ppl inside this cafe and decided to give it a try.   It was a HK style Cafe where they have set meals. Wanted Congee, so I ordered that! It came with a choice of side dish. So I chose fried dough.   It was small but there was tons of ingredients in it. For $5.65 (I think, can't remember) quite a good deal for a quick brekkie."}
{"text":"Cheap eats!  Cheap eats! I've often driven by this plaza, not knowing what it contained and one day I decided to look up HK cafes in Markham and did a double-take.  I've been here twice so far for lunch and they have a lot of things to choose from on their menu.  Typical HK cafe fare and a copy of Sing Tao newspaper is free for patrons near the entrance.  Service is pretty quick -- food comes out pretty quickly after you order and the portions are decently-sized for the price.  Looking forward to trying out their afternoon tea menu (after 2:30pm) or their breakfast some time!"}
{"text":"Came to Ming's for afternoon tea with my dad. It's one of your genuine classic HK cafes, I would definitely recommend coming here from 2:30-6 to grab their afternoon tea specials like I did (noodles were $5 with the drink) it's also available on the weekend- it's a dish plus a drink of milk tea or coffee. The milk tea reminds me of the quality you would get in Hong Kong.   I also recommend asking to buy their chilli oil that they serve at the restaurant! You can buy their own restaurant made chilli oil that's pretty sweet with a mild spicy kick for those who aren't as great with spice like me, you can buy it at the cash for 5.50 a bottle! Every tome we buy the bottle we finish it up quickly at home!"}
{"text":"I visited Ming's Noodle Cafe maybe 2 years ago and have never returned since.  I ordered a soup noodle.  It tasted okay, and I would not say anything negative about the soup noodle; that would be unfair.  1 star is for the food.  The second star is for the interior spaciousness and decoration  Zero star is for the service.  How did Ming's cross me?  Try totally neglecting me after I placed an order.  No tea refill.  Had a heck of a time waving to waitresses (plural) to get refill, and they (plural) always looked the other directions, as if the two of them facing each other could not cover 360 degree of line of sight.  Try me having a hard time getting a bill to pay and get out.  And I wanted to leave.  The way I was serviced or not serviced, I might as well be eating in a food court.  Talking about a lasting impression.  A first and last impression."}
{"text":"Big portions and good value.  Chicken and rice $7.95 - the chicken was tender and fresh.  Curry beef brisket with rice $8.45 - meat was nice and flaky but curry sauce was only okay for me.   Seafood with spaghetti and cream sauce $8.75 - lots of fresh shrimp.  All of the above comes with soup and hot drink but add $1 each for iced milk tea.  Udon noodle with two meats $7.45 +$1 for udon noodle - nothing to really point out.  French toast $3.75 - bread was fresh and soft. Deep fried to perfection.  Service was fast considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"Normally come for their breakfast but let the house late today and went for lunch. Since I've never went to lunch though I might try it. But their menu for lunch is a bit pricier then their breakfast.  Note if you come for breakfast it's normally packed caused it's a good deal. Around $5-6 for a combo with a Chinese newspaper. Lunch was more $10-15. If your lucky theirs would still be some newspaper left during lunch hour. It's one free paper per table.  Ordered a satay rice noodle with a side of egg sandwich and a soy milk. $ 6.50   Mom ordered a preserved veggie pork rice noodle with a side of egg sausage omelette and a slice of toast. Same price  If you ask me it's a good deal and also their breakfast comes with a choice of congee too.  The stars would be lack of service and sometimes he wait."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I've been to Ming's Noodle Cafe over ten years ago, but haven't bothered returning as I'm not frequently in the area. After successive poor experiences at its sister branch of Kitchen M, I decided to return here and see if I can relive what used to be a great HK style cafe today.  I had the baked seafood and penne with rose sauce, which came with a starter soup and salad. The cream soup that they have is decent; it's actually quite creamy, which isn't like the watered down versions you get in most HK style cafes. The salad didn't have a lot of sauce in it, but was otherwise okay.  The main course came relatively quick. The presentation looked quite good, but upon first dib I realized the rose sauce didn't really taste like rose sauce, but more like the cream sauce from the cream soup. It still tasted okay, but it wasn't exactly what I intended for it to taste at the end.  Service was not the best, as the server I had needed to ask what my order was at least twice, even though she wrote it down. Not sure why she needed to do that, unless she was afraid that she wrote it wrong...  I likely won't return here since there are better options in the area now."}
{"text":"My favorite HK style cafe. They have the best HK style milk tea and baked pork chop in tomato sauce with rice! I love their French toast with peanut butter and condensed milk. Price is decent! Service is acceptable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely making this restaurant my canteen. Their food are delicious and very hk-like. Wok-fried rice/noodles are must try. You will not regret it.  However i would not order the deep-fried chicken thigh again. It is just not hk-liked. And if i want non-hk style deep fried chicken, there are too many other choices out there."}
{"text":"I love this classic HK café.. portions are huge and the food is quick and dirty!  I find it so hard to find classic HK café dishes in and around Markham/Richmond Hill these days.  This place can get very busy weekend mornings so sharing a table with a stranger is not uncommon!  Ming's Noodle has a huge breakfast menu with an assortment of combinations of classic HK breakfast..including macaroni, vermicelli, satay beef, eggs/ham/toast.. anything you can possibly think of!  Other notable items on the menu are the club sandwich & fries.. and baked portugese chicken rice."}
{"text":"Must try the XO sauce beef chow fun! It has a very good favor and it's not too greasy. ????Lunch was served very quickly and hot."}
{"text":"First time trying this place on a Saturday night around 7pm. Not so busy which is great for a Saturday night - maybe because there was a rain storm? Lots of seating and booths compared to most Chinese cafes. Parking is generous with lots of available spots as well.   As for their menu, there is A LOT to choose from.   We got two combo for $21.13  1. All day special - noodles with satay beef, egg sandwich and iced milk tea.  2. Spaghetti special - mixed veggies spaghetti on tomato sauce, soup of the day and iced milk tea.   The quality isn't the best but you get what you pay for.  Great portions, we enjoyed the service and food came out for quick! Definitely recommend if you're looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"Mings is my go to HK cafe in Scarborough. You can't go wrong with getting the peanut butter condensed milk french toast - very unhealthy but so good. The service is very fasted pace and busy on the weekends for lunch. You can expect a wide selection of various HK cafe styled dishes. One of my other personal favorites are their baked cream chicken steak with spaghetti and iced lemon tea."}
{"text":"Best HK style milk tea in Toronto! It's very smooth and has a good flavour balance. I mainly come here for the tea but if you enjoy cheap, large portioned meals, this casual HK diner would also satisfy that requirement. They have a breakfast combo before 11am where you can mix and match two choices (usually eggs and ham + toast with a noodle dish) and a drink for $5.95. Their afternoon tea menu has pretty good deals too! When you're paying this little, don't expect anything in terms of service, atmosphere, etc."}
{"text":"Yes I am doing an update of Ming's Noodle Cafe less than 1 week since posted my last review.  Dropped by for lunch. This place is still packed! I know it is Canada Day and I have to wait for a table. :)  I ordered the Curry Beef Brisket with rice all day special ($7.50) which includes soup and hot drink. I have to say the Beef Brisket is the best I have ate in any restaurant... Yes it is that good! The cut of the brisket has the perfect mix of fat and lean and it is so tender... they just melt in my mouth tender! And it has excellent meat flavour without the curry sauce over powering it! I just ate the whole thing.... all my myself.. and even all the rice! Even the rice is soft and hot..just the way I like it!  My friend's Pork Chop with Fresh Tomato ($6.25) though a la carte, has tons of tomatoes and so huge and fresh off the wok hot!  Yes I would definitely be back and try out the dinner dishes that starts from $5.95!"}
{"text":"5 stars mainly for the chilli oil!  I have yet to eat here but my rating is for how great the chilli oil is!   I drive across from Mississauga just for it! If you like spicy toppings like me then you must try it!  Price has gone up to $5.50 per bottle now."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite to eat. The store is a bit hard to find because it's on the ground floor of a commercial building and the front is covered with pine trees. This is a hole in the wall place for HK style cafe honest food which includes various noodles, friend rice, and even fried chicken/fries. You can also get HK style milk tea here which is probably the signature of the HK style cafe. Service is run of the mill decent. Don't expect great ambiance. This is strictly a place to grab a quick bite and go."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, but I don't consider they are close to authentic in the dishes they make. $ value is good, for a fast breakfast or lunch, just to fill up your stomach. The service is not good, nor terrible; can't expect great attention, nor smiling faces if you are not a regular."}
{"text":"If you want some cheap eats and good portions then this is great place to eat.  Taste wise is like any other Chinese restaurant and it can get confusing if you have like 5 different menus to see what you wanna eat.  I got the veggie chow mien which was okay.  Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch on Sunday and there's always a lineup. The usual Hong Kong style diner with a huge menu of food. Not just the usual baked rice dishes and egg sandwiches, there's ramen and Malaysian dishes. Simple decoration for family meals and the service was average.  Ordered the Hainanese chicken with rice, it comes with soup and a drink. The meal portions was very satisfying, there was leftovers to take home. The chicken was dark meat so it was very moist and smooth but the skin was a little too salty. The rice was flavoured and went very well with the chicken.  Overall, will be back for more food in the future."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I've never had such a horrible meal in a while. To be honest, I'd rather have home made instant noodles than what I ate here. The salt and pepper shrimp was mushy, the chicken had this colour which didn't make it look fresh or appetizing at all. We ordered a lamb hotpot which was not hot at all, and the lamb had a horrible taste. We had five people for dinner, and they came out with two overflowing bowls of dessert for five people. Even if they paid me, I refuse to come back. Go down the street to Chiu Chow Boy! They're much better!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic HK cafe experience where locals eat at with the noisy environment, dirt cheap prices, this is the place to go. But if you are looking how how clean this place Is, or the quality of the food, this may not be it for you. This place reminds me the cafes that I used to go to in Hong Kong. Very busy, quick service, efficient. I came here with my siblings and toddler. Got a cheap breakfast for $6.45 including eggs/ham/toast, a vermicelli with pickled veggies and pork, and an HK milk tea, which is incredibly cheap!!! There are many set combos you can choose from. However, the food is as basic as you can get with very little flavoring and small portions. The HK tea was very good though, vermecilli wasn't bad. Table was sticky though, floors dirty."}
