{"text":"So since I started working morning and being around breakfast food, I get a craving for fried eggs and bacon on my burger and thank goodness for Modern Burger and their breakfast burger. I get the yummy cheeseburger with my breakfast accoutrements lol. And to top it off, I still get their awesome fries. And when I want to splurge, I get another shake of the month, which so far hasn't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The Fox group does a great job of creating a great dining experience with the theme, decor and menus at their restaurants.  However, the sliders and ice cream sandwiches at Modern Burger were not winners.  The fries were fantastic, the service was great and I really like the idea.  Maybe the food is better at Modern Steak?  I hope so!"}
{"text":"Decent burger. Overpriced,  but that's what you get at the airport. Fries were not fresh and were not warm."}
{"text":"Had a short layover in PHX airport terminal A. didn't have enough time to sit at a bar. saw this place and decided to give it a try. i was in the mood for hot breakfast food, but my flight landed at 11am local time. Most of the nearby eateries stopped serving their breakfast food at 10am, so I thought I would have to just \"grab a burger and go\".  Found this place and saw the \"breakfast burger\" on the menu. Got it with the all beef patty, with bacon, fried egg (over easy), tomato, lettuce, cheese and thousand island spread... hell yeah! Hot breakfast food! kindof.. but it hit the spot and it was really good. Did not skimp on the bacon and the mixture of runny egg and cheese gave the texture of a good hash (except with ground beef not corned beef).   Scarfed this sucker down so fast, I have time to write this review before boarding my connecting flight.  didn't order any fries, so can't comment on that. would have ordered hash if they had some, but didn't. this is more of a burger and hot dog joint, not a \"breakfast\" place. But if you're feeling like some breakfast food, but every other eatery in terminal A says it's not the appropriate time for breakfast, take your business to modern burger and get your bacon/egg/cheese fix!  Also ordered coffee. pretty light and standard large volume drip. nothing to write about here. just filled up my thermos for the plane.  Alright! Gotta board my flight, but if you're in the area and need a quick fix, this breakfast burger's da bomb!!!  Price is decent for Airport food. paid $7.50 for breakfast burger with beef and $2.25 for the coffee. Fast service. Great food. Won't miss your flight! Go Go Go!"}
{"text":"I order a kids cheese burger and it's enough to fill me up. This Burger joint gets the job done and is an upgrade from McDonald's."}
{"text":"Good food. They sell kids meal that is just right for me. It includes a slider (which is pretty much a full sized burger) , French fries (fresh and generous portion) and drink, for like 6 bucks. This is my favorite airport food actually. The bar next to it is a good place to hangout for a beer when waiting for your next flight."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good burgers and dogs! The only complaint is $2.25 for a 20oz soda seems excessive... but that is the nature of eating in an airport!"}
{"text":"I just had the double cheeseburger, the Modern Dog, fries, and a chocolate shake, and all were excellent!  The hot dog was a Vienna Beef dog with a Vienna Beef bun and had the toppings of a standard Chicago Dog and was delicious.  The burger was also delicious, one of the best I have ever had in an airport.  Everything on it was perfect, the lettuce and tomatoes would not have been better anywhere.  The fries were good, they were seasoned, but pretty standard.  The shake tasted great.  I had exceptional service from Dawn and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cold and stale fries. Got the \"modern dog\" which is essentially a Chicago style hot dog. It wasn't clear whether they had bothered to heat it up or cook the hot dog as it was room temperature. Terrible terrible food."}
{"text":"I tend to write 4-5 star reviews, but mostly because I can't remember all the mediocre places I've eaten at enough to come home and bother writing about it. If it's good, or if it's bad, I'll post a review on Yelp. And this place was surprisingly good - although this review is mostly for the BLT. Cheap for an airport spot, the BLT was in soft sweet hamburger buns with generous bacon. It really hit the spot. My boyfriend got the breakfast burger, and he enjoyed it. He said it was \"pretty good\" and I'll take his word for it :P"}
{"text":"This place is a cool departure from the usual \"mall\" fare seating is awkward at best, there are only two long bench style seats, but the staff was cool and the food was good...."}
{"text":"I tried a burger with a fried egg on it. It was the best thing I've ever tasted. Get the double cheeseburger with grilled onions and fried egg."}
{"text":"Modern Burger's Grab and Go station serves healthy and high quality salads and sandwiches among other dishes.  I had the black bean salad with cortija cheese and would highly recommend it. The greens were a crisp spring mix. It included black beans, pico de gallo, a sprinkling of corn kernels (not from a can because they were really crispy), avocado, and taco strips. At $8, this salad is comparable to the price of other airport meals. It was a substantial salad and everything was very fresh.  I also saw a chopped salad and Chinese chicken salad at the station. The staff was friendly and the line was very short. You can also order other dishes at this station (burgers?).  I would recommend Modern Burger for someone who appreciates healthy food while traveling, especially if you enjoy salads and veggies."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler and have passed this place a 1000 times. Tonight I should have passed it again. No line but had to wait 5 min to place my order while the person behind the counter chatted up an airport worker. I was tempted to leave but had my heart set on a burger. Finally was called to the counter to order.  $14+ for a double burger, fries and a water. The burger: thin fast food style patties with no flavor, I suspect they used the bun to wipe the grease off the grill...sometimes there aren't enough napkins! It was topped with a little bit of lettuce 1 small tomato slice and some very thin 1000 island dressing that had the consistancy of water. Thank god the grease soaked bun repelled the watery dressing, there is nothing worse than bread soaked in water! Or so I thought..... Apparently the top fell off the salt shaker when they were salting the fries or shall we just call them grease sponges? No amount of ketchup could cover the taste of these little gems.  The good news is that my bottle of water was good and uncontaminated by this place.  I have been on a diet for months that prevented me from having burgers...well buns. Was soo looking forword to enjoying this.....next time I'll just keep walking."}
{"text":"Food was good but less than stellar. What really keeps this place from earning more than 2 stars is their lack of commitment to their hours of operation. As I write this as 9:58pm, they are clearly trying to give off the impression that they are closed by barring the entrances with chairs. It seems that the staff is slightly confused about whether this  is a fast food restaurant at an airport with open seating or a sit down restaurant. I came a quarter to 10 and was unable to get a shake because they had already turned off the machine. Despite my confusion for why they need a machine to refrigerate hand scooped shakes, I was unable to order from their already limited menu. Such is what many travelers are used to at airports but I can only imagine what could have been if the staff were more committed. I can only give a limited recommendation."}
{"text":"I really like the modern burger attached to modern steak. Its exactly what you should expect (and more) from a restaurant/take out in the mall. It's quick, delicious & inexpensive. I usually don't like a lot of food options in food courts and this is a great alternative to the standard mall food. Check it out if you want something quick & yummy so you can keep shopping!"}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burger before catching a flight for the holidays, boy was I glad I skipped a Starbucks coffee!! Imagine in n out with bacon and a egg unreal and delicious. Service was fast, staff was not the friendliest would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"I saw this place when I deplaned, went to my gate in another section, and came back for it. For $3, you can get some of the best fries I've ever had. Their single burger at $5.50 is pretty damn good, too. Tastes great with just the right amount of sauce. Staff was kind enough to tell us that we weren't in line - those were just people waiting for their food (you'd think the people waiting would've told us, right?). All in all, a good deal!"}
{"text":"Daaanggg...This place is good. The crowd around the window brought my attention to Modern Burger.  Your wait may be long but the burger is worth it. If you can appreciate a juicy but less messy burger than this is it! Seating is extremely limited so just take your meal and go sit elsewhere."}
{"text":"sure, some have out foxed him and beat him to the punch even, 'out of the boxed' him with new ideas, a hunch but none shall out expand him every leasing agent calls and no one will out brand him \"concepts\" in every mall the guy sweats design, details oft overlooks great food the gross and net sales, prevail mean, what's the guy to do? backed by bread, behind him sharks, they swim or die expansion is the mantra so sam thought that he might try to modernize a burger really, what does that mean? well, as far as i can tell decided he could squeeze more money from a kitchen he'd already built  his rent, i'm only guessing would make most others wilt investors want their money so sam made one place, two \"i'll tell you what, no i'm not nuts here's what we're gonna do... serve sliders, salads, simple to shoppers on the run the fancy folks at fashion square just watch, we'll make a ton of cash..... it's genius window, cut through a wall convenient cool, the price is right smack dab dere in da mall\" a concept in a concept voila! the guy is good and if that's modern thinking then perhaps, others, should think modern, man, against the grain burgers, out of a box yep, sam you're nuts, you're crazy yep...crazy like a fox"}
{"text":"2.5 - burger with fried egg  3.0 - service 3.0 - overall: very good for airport food."}
{"text":"My opinion is that the burger is about like mcdonalds with a better bun. I was filed cause the guy in front of me had what looked like a thick burger but he must have had a double cause the patties are thin. Also my order was incorrect. Fries were ok and I did not try one of their shakes."}
{"text":"Very good burger considering it's at an airport. I had a double with cheese, bacon and grilled onions and it was very tasty; the fries were good, too. I didn't try the shakes because they said they weren't made with real ice cream (just some type of shake mix)."}
{"text":"It's hard to find decent food while I am traveling from airport to airport. Modern Burger had a great variety of fresh salads that fit my healthy lifestyle. Most salads sold at airports are bland and limited - chicken caesar salad or a veggie salad with no protein. I had a mixed greens salad packed with veggies, baked chicken, and hard boiled eggs with a light dressing. I was very impressed by how nutritionally balanced all their selections were! If you're someone who watches what they eat, this is a great choice :)"}
{"text":"I know I am at an airport but 18.00 for a poor quality fast food burger and fries served in a brown paper bag is ridiculous.   It wasn't even a good burger and fries. Sloppy, messy overdone thin parties that I think we're boiled not broiled.   If I am going to spend that much on a fast food burger I would much rather go to five guys."}
{"text":"I think the A5 Breakfast Sandwich is my all time fave.  Definitely stop here if you're nearby in the morning."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place in an airport! Got the breakfast burger and it was delicious. Bacon, fried egg and a juicy patty - what could go wrong? The price is reasonable but the portion was a bit small."}
{"text":"Grabbed my kids a couple of breakfast sandwiches here before an early morning flight. They both said that they were pretty tasty. The workers there definitely weren't too pleased to be working but heck, that's what you get these days!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely shocked that I have never written a review for this place!  I am not really a big fan of Hamburgers, an even lesser fan of Ice Tea. However, Modern Burger has the best Ice Tea I have ever had.  I get it without Ice, it is really delicious. I bought one for my friend as we were passing through Phoenix and changing planes. I told her it had to be tried. She loved it and she is from Georgia, they know good Ice Tea. The Hamburgers are great! Cooked fresh and they will put anything you want on them. I am going to say the Fries are only good hot. Not so good once they get cold. But, they serve everything nice and hot. This is always a great place to get some good hot food in the Airport. It is located on the Low A side of Terminal 4. They are always busy , but service is very quick!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly a very good burger place in an airport. The simple menu makes it super easy to order, the seating area is nicely designed, and food is super fresh. Would totally come back here the next time I'm flying through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decided to try modern burger at the airport while waiting for flight. I got a single burger with cheese and grilled onions, also Fries. It was pretty good for an airport burger and was made fast. The fries were really good and were fresh and salty just the way I like it. I wouldn't recommend the tea tho it was horrible"}
{"text":"This rating is just for the $5.47 milk shakes. I was told by two people that they are really good and i was horribly disappointed. I kept my composure through half before it went in the trash. I cant remember the last time i threw food away until now."}
{"text":"Definitely doesn't taste like airport food! I was there for a 11am flight so I ordered the BLT with an egg for an extra $1.50 or something. I didn't see the breakfast special, which had avocado added for a dollar less than what I paid, in time. I was puzzled at the price difference but considering this was one of the cheaper meals I've had in an airport and I was starving I didn't care that much. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and the bread was delicious, almost like a brioche bun. The bacon was flavorful but a bit on the thin side so it was crispy but not very toothsome. The egg was medium hard. I would have preferred my egg to be cooked to order since I like runny yolks that run over my sandwich but I can understand why they didn't offer that option because it takes more time and since it's travel food most people want neat not messy food.  I was very satisfied and I'll go back next time I fly in to Phoenix. I would definitely try the burger since that's what they specialize in."}
{"text":"Good service and good food! I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them! A quick little meal for those on the go! The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting."}
{"text":"Basically fast food. My BLT was slapped together and looked like a mess.  Also about 3x too much mayonnaise. Yuck.   Fries were good as were shakes. My kids said burgers were ok. Can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Eating a modern burger makes one wonder what is so difficult about making a delicious hamburger in the first place.  Fresh lettuce, flavorful sauce, soft bun, appropriately cooked meat, that's about it, right?  Ok, maybe the 'fresh lettuce' part is hard to do in an airport, but this place even gets that right.  I'll make this review easy for you to decide...I ordered one on a layover, and then had to have a second one for the road.   You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Am I in an airport? This is a really good burger for being an airport joint. Pricey, but better than any other airport food I've had."}
{"text":"Just a place for quick airport food. The modern dog I got was really good (and the fries). You get to choose how you want the burger made too like if you want raw onions or not."}
{"text":"Awesome burger n fries. The bun is my favorite of any burger place"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burger!! Very modern looking and refreshing. Sadly it's kinda small and people hover to wait for food, so you might want to bring your food elsewhere. However, I discovered that the space at the next door Olive and Ivy marketplace can be shared even though you eat at modern burger!!!! Hurray.   Another tip for travelers, the wait is about 15-20 minutes during meal hours. So gauge your flight timing!!   Finally, on to the food. I got the breakfast burger - bacon, fried egg, patty, lettuce, tomato and delicious mayo like sauce. It wasn't my favorite  burger BUT I would definitely try it again next time. The fried egg was a little too cooked for my liking but it wasn't noticeable. You can also get extras or tell them to cook your meat a certain way or remove some toppings. My favorite part of the burger was the sauce!!!! The bread was alright.. Kinda soggy. Not the worst though.   I also got the fries. Mmmm not my favorite and I wouldn't recommend it. Fat and soft. And although it might just have been sitting out for 10 minutes, it was cold when I got it. :(  Overall really good for airport food standard."}
{"text":"Very good  flavor. Size was 1/4 lb so it's a little small but still filling if you get a double or fries. I recommend the breakfast burger with a fried egg on top or the meat patty. Fries have good seasoning! Took about 10 minutes to get our food around 12:30."}
{"text":"Everything is ok.  The only problem with my breakfast burger was the patty itself.  The meat was tough and dry.  Slightly cool so it seems like they made the patty in advance which I think explains the problem.  Can't recommend this place.  If they would cook everything fresh then it would be 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"Went in with low expectations-- it is at an airport --but I was impressed. Burger was salty and greasy and delicious! I've certainly spent more on worse burgers."}
{"text":"Double cheeseburger. Just like another McDonald's except the bun is definitely better and less oily.  You have to pay for cheese. .. what! ?"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my existence and I try it at an airport in Phoenix. Who would've known?! I can't pinpoint what it is exactly that makes these burgers so extraordinarily good. Maybe it's the extra melted cheese on my patty, or the super fresh veges that they add in. It also might be because I was as hungry as a pair of starving hyenas.   The buns were so puffy with a bit of a crunch to it. They must have made it fresh! If I find out that any of the food there is frozen or processed, I will instantly become a fan of processed frozen food. Yep.. THAT'S how good those burgers are."}
{"text":"Last time we were in PHX we spent $75 for a terrible meal at Zinc so we were looking to spend a bit less and I checked out reviews and this place seemed popular and well rated (and cheap as far as airport grub goes).  They were pretty busy but hustling along so we placed our order.  The burger looked great, but tasted not so good.  As I always try to point out the positives, I will say the buns were really good, like a brioche or egg enriched bread.  The main issue was my burger tasted and smelled like dishwater.  It was subtle, but definitely a distinct off taste.  I deconstructed the burger to figure out why it tasted like dishsoap, and I think I narrowed it down the the lettuce and tomato?  the tomato was also pale and unripe.  Maybe somehow the veggies were not rinsed well?  They had a stale industrial sink sanitizer taste. I tasted the meat patty seperately too and it was not good, also had a bit of an off taste, kind of the taste of meat that's been cooked and refridgerated and reheated, even though I know the patty was cooked to order and not reheated.  My kids were not interested in finishing their burgers, and my husband shrugged and said \"it's airport food\".  The fries are standard frozen fast food fries.    I don't think I'll be eating here the next time I'm traveling through PHX."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in recent memory.  A healthy shot of cheese, crispy bacon. Amazingly affordable for an airport restaurant.  My go to place for when I'm laying over in Phoenix in the future."}
{"text":"Last week I literally walked the entire distance of the Phoenix airport just to get to this burger joint.  That's about a mile of hallways.  This is probably the 10th time I've eaten at Modern Burger on my layovers -- it's always worth it.  The best thing is the modern burger and fries.  Standard American Diet and comfort food.   The only thing that brings it down every time is the service.  As other people have noted, it's pretty terrible.  There's a long wait every time and the staff are not interested.  But it's an airport venue, so there you go. The prices are good and the food is excellent.  It's worth putting up with the rest."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly excellent burger at a small hole-in-the-wall at Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4 (in section A1-14)  I got the double burger with cheese, thousand island, grilled onions for $9.75 plus tax.   Devoured it as soon as I boarded my plane before it took off. I think it will take care of my hunger until I land on the other side of the country!  This is a highly recommended burger if you are passing through PHX on American Airlines!"}
{"text":"Best airport burger but moreover best burger compared to Shake Shack or In N Out!  So happy you are at the airport too!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Yelp had to remind me that I ate here. I ate the burger waiting in line because USAirways cancelled all the outbound flights to SFO for no reason.  So there's two things in this review that I would hesitate before doing again."}
{"text":"Great for a quick pre/post flight burger and fries fix! The french fries were cut thick and delightfully greasy. The service was quick but seemed to be made to order as well, which is nice!"}
{"text":"A REALLY good burger for the price at the airport.  Not your usual dried out gross patty. This was juicy with your choice of toppings on a delicious bun. FFs and a shake to complete the meal!!  Go here. It's worth the airport stop."}
{"text":"Fancy White Castle, is what I will be calling you Modern Burger.  That is actually a compliment coming from me because I love White Castle.  Everyone I know says they hate it, but I believe they are just too embarrassed to admit how good those little burgers are.  You, Modern Burger, are pretty much doing the same thing but better.  Now if only you'd add chicken rings to your menu and stay open for late night drunken cravings, I'd never need to go to the Midwest again."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but deceivingly pricy if you add on fries and a drink (the burger was only $8 but my total came to around $15). I also don't like that there's virtually no seating and it's extremely busy, which makes the whole experience kind of frantic. However if you're running to catch your flight and plan on eating at the gate, it's a pretty good bet; they're very fast. Just be sure to grab some extra napkins."}
{"text":"So you are stuck in an airport and looking at Yelp for something delicious?   Sorry, you are in an airport.  That said, Modern Burger will fill you up for your next 3-4 hour flight. You won't tell anyone about your experience, but you won't have to eat a cold United breakfast burrito either."}
{"text":"holy moly- a fox concept i like?!   well, i've always loved the design of the restaurants, but never the food. Modern Steak is next door and is now my inspiration for my backyard design. It's eye candy for sure. Sorry- back to modern burger.   This place is so well priced for what you get. and it's tasty! it sorta tastes like a better version of in n out to me. The meat patties are thick and juicy, and the bun is so buttery. the grilled onions are my favorite touch. i'm sure my clients love my onion breath, too. i'm kidding, i wisp after lunch. (BTW- highly recommend wisps)  the fries are so good- they were crunchy. I don't know if that was on purpose but I love crunchy fries that have a little fluff in the middle. divine.   I had a bite of one of their ice cream cookie sandwiches and highly recommend that you pass on getting one. not a fan.  there are, however, two things i would add or change: 1. how is american a modern cheese? havarti is more posh :)  2. a to-go phone #- i could take a lunch break in 5 minutes if i was able to call my order ahead for pick up. plus it makes sense being in the mall with all the retail workers. their lunch breaks are short."}
{"text":"mmm mmmm that's a tasty burger! If you're in the A terminal and have some time, I highly suggest this little burger stand over the other one  - less expensive and extremely tasty. I ordered a double with cheese, grilled onions, and a fried egg. Fantastic burger - makes you temporarily forget you're stuck at an airport!"}
{"text":"Of course there are a lot of mixed reviews here. This location is in the Airport.  Term. 4 Sky Harbor on the US airways side. Kid working the counter was nice and tried to handle everyone as well as he could. The lady behind me was yelling because, there was no Bacon left. It was 5:00 at night on Easter Day.  I got a Burger and Fries and an Ice Tea. I thought they were all really good.  Not too bad of a price either. I did not wait too long for my food and it was nice and hot when I got it.  The woman was still yelling at the kid because they were out of bacon. Hey, everyone just remember, it is not the fault of the emplyoees when things run out. That is management that does the ordering. Plus, you are making everyone work on Easter,I am sure they would all rather be home with their families. So spread the Joy not the Hate~"}
{"text":"Quite a good burger. The beef patty, which was purported to be 1/4 lb, was not so substantial, but the entire ensemble was great. The tomato was thick and fresh and the bun ! The bun was very good.   The fries were very good. Nicely seasoned an perfectly cooked.  Service was a little on the slow side tho."}
{"text":"Inside of an airport, this is without a doubt the best burger I've ever had. Outside of an airport, it's in my top 5 of all time. Yes, I said it...this shit is the real deal.  I didn't try the fries or milkshake, but I can attest that this place is worth getting to, no matter how far you have to walk through this airport...do yourself a favor and do it."}
{"text":"Try the modern burger with grilled onions... Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried Modern Burger twice now on the run at the airport, but have been let down twice because both times the burger was not cooked done, but nearly raw. The fries were very good and the staff is pleasant.....nice to see a change in the airport food. JUST COOK THEM LONGER :-)"}
{"text":"Great burger, great price! Tasted fresh and refreshing, unlike other fast food burgers!"}
{"text":"Modern Burger at the airport! Great breakfast burger.  This was a quick grab-n-go run, I really liked the breakfast burger. You'll pay more than you think you should, but no more than other airport food and it's way better tasting."}
{"text":"This place gets busy... Quick. I ordered my food and suddenly 15 ppl was behind me. But that is pretty normal for food spots in the airport. The burger n fries was just ok but I didn't expect anything special. The cashier was quick and courteous. Nothing grand about here but if I am ever in Phoenix starving about to board my plane... I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Worth mentioning in a conversation about Five Guys and/or In-N-Out. Especially considering it's true underdog status of airport food. The same style of ordering, single or double patty, w/ or w/o onions, and of course thousand island. Milkshakes are good too."}
{"text":"$5 for single or $6.50 for double burger, with cheese +0.50 and fried egg +1. Fries +$3 Surprisingly delicious!  Especially for airport food, the price is not bad at all at around $11 for a meal and it tasted great. Soft bun, high quality patty, and who can deny a fried egg in a hamburger??? The fries were on the healthier side similar to In N Out, but with a little more seasoning. They tasted amazing too.   Very fast service too, I don't see anything wrong with this place at all."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burger for $8-9 and with another cup of soda, it came to around $11 total with all the taxes included.  My breakfast burger tasted great. The beef was moist and juicy and I loved that the fried egg still has running yolk in it! :) The burger was probably fatty, but hey I felt much better eating this than, say another low-grade place like Burger King or McDonald's! :)  Minus one-star for very small seating (just a bar seating for perhaps 8-10 people and 2 additional 2-people tables)...so good luck grabbing one of those seats....especially when the place is probably crowded during lunch/dinner! Overall, I was quite happy with my lunch on the go while waiting to board my flight home!"}
{"text":"I really like the flavor of the food. I was not even hungry but definitely eat it all. Ok price for airport restaurants. I liked the fact that they where open after 9pm"}
{"text":"Double burger with grilled onions was good and at $8 was the best value compared to other airport food.  My go to place for meat in airports."}
{"text":"Just kilt my breakfast burger & it was pretty good. Nice size burger & it wasn't to dry, 1000 island dressing helped. I don't eat ketchup so I always use bbq sauce but they didn't have any. What burger place doesn't have bbq sauce?"}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed this burger. Are they the in-n-out of Arizona? I was very hungry as I stepped off the plane so my senses may have been heightened. The burger was juicy & the meat stood on its own. I always enjoy a simple juicy cheeseburger. The egg bun was a nice compliment with the thousand island sauce."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was quite hungover and exhausted when my best friend and I stopped in Phoenix on our way home from Vegas. Our flight was early, we didn't want to leave Sin City and I was a tad cranky that we had a 45 min layover (Grr..) While we were walking around the US Airways terminal looking for a snack, we came across Modern Burger. I'm pretty hesitant re: airport food but I decided to give it a try. Oh My God. Modern Burger.. please open an outlet in NY. Please. Your Cheeseburgers are amazing. The beef is great quality - as was the salad I opted to put on to of my burger. However - the fries were the best part of my meal. Beautifully cut and seasoned to perfection.  I am literally now going to transit in Phoenix every time I fly west now - just to have my Modern Burger fix!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Modern Burger.  I tried the one in the Sky Harbor Airport during a business trip.   The food was prepared fast.  The seating was very limited, although I was lucky to end up with a table.  The burger was good.  The big thing that brought the whole experience down was the soggy bun.  Even though I ate my burger pretty quickly after recieveing it,  part of my bun was soggy.   The fries were okay.  I also tried a shake.  I don't like chocolate (I know), so the only other option was a vanilla????  A vanilla shake?  I think you should call that a cup of soft serve ice cream without a topping."}
{"text":"I had a quick layover and I was starving! I needed something close to my gate that was fast and easy. Modern Burger did just that and more.   The Breakfast Burger caught my eye on their huge wall menu. Fresh ground beef, American cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce, and fried egg. Everything in it I wanted! I ordered a single patty which came out to about $8. No fries or soda included. Airport food equals airport price.   The burger was fantastic. I didn't really expect much. I was just hungry, period. Pleasantly surprised, the brioche bun was sweet, soft, and buttery. Love it when the starch sticks to the roof of my mouth! The beef patty tasted fresh and delicious, while the bacon was of abundance. Rarely the case and of all places, they got this down. I wish the fried egg had a runny yolk but that's already asking too much, huh?  Nice and pleasant staff over the counter. Seating is limited. Just a bar with a few stools and a couple tables for two. Turnover is fast since everyone's rushing to a flight somewhere. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"There are very few places to eat in terminal 4 at Phoenix airport and modern Burger is one of them. I only had a few moments to grab something before I boarded and this was the place I had to go. I got a burger which wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. It was a step up from most fast food but not what a mid range burger joint should be serving. I also got a hot dog and here is what upset me. They have a \"simple\" dog that is just a hot dog or they have a modern hot dog that is really a Chicago style dog with a different name. I didn't want the whole modern hot dog thing so I asked them if they could put onions on the simple dog. They refused, the lady at the counter was adamant that they wouldn't add them. When I explained I didn't want all the other toppings she just looked at me. For a second I thought she had gone mute or lost her ability to speak but she glared at me like I deeply offended her by even asking. Their has to be something said for giving the customer what they want...even an outlandish request like onions. You can keep your mediocre food and poor service Modern Burger."}
{"text":"The worst  Out of product   Food takes forever. Can't delay on food at airport ridiculous"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break.   I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad. I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:  Perfectly portioned and well-priced, it's filled with chopped turkey, Vermont Cheddar, hard-boiled eggs, crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes and corn. I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing, but there's also a vinaigrette option. All that for just under $6!  I've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are. I know if I am craving a big juicy burger, I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall, or better yet Five Guys when it opens!  This was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not. Take-out is obviously what the aim is here, as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Weird but one of the best breakfast sandwiches EVER, at the airport ??  I know !!! Bacon, egg & avacado on a hot grilled bun, light mayo. Off the chain. Breakfast greatness."}
{"text":"Great new, local addition to Sky Harbor Airport!  I tried a single cheeseburger and loved it...the bun was tasty and fresh, the burger was just the right size and I had cheese, tomato and 1,000 island dressing on it too!  Wish they would put napkins in the bag when handing it to you though...a little messy on the airplane."}
{"text":"I can not fly into this airport and not get a burger from this place.  Its really good."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast burger - burger with bacon and egg and cheese.  Delicious.  Great fries.  We always eat here when we have a stopover in PHX.  But, there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"I am unfaithful. I cheated. I admit it. But I was hungry and my favorite burger place is not in Sky Harbor Airport A Gates.  I only ordered two items. One, a double burger no onions and two, a vanilla milkshake.  The milkshake was small but who needs a gigantic cup of ice cream anyway. Not I for sure.  The burger was not under cooked or over cooked but just right. It was very juicy and delicious and the shake was tasty.  My local California place is still my favorite but I'll be back here when I'm in sky harbor.  Bon appétit Travellers"}
{"text":"This place should be called microwave burger, not modern burger. Stopped by and had a single with cheese.  The burger was terrible and so was the service.  McDonald's is better than this place."}
{"text":"Order Breakfast Burger ($7.50) which include fried egg, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes. Perfectly great portion! If you order breakfast sandwich ($6.00) then it will not have the ground beef. Since I have to transit at PHX, I will recommend Modern Burger. Another choice I may try  next time is DeluxBurger (Located at Gate 23 - Terminal 4)."}
{"text":"I needed to stay around terminal A and gave Modern Burger a try. They do pre made salads that look tasty and I had a Chinese Style Chicken Salad in my hand I was about to get and changed my mind thinking a fresh made breakfast burger might be better. I may have been expecting too much since I was expecting a yummy burger tasty like a Zinburger. But what I got was more like a really good fast food type burger. Like what a Whopper Jr might be like if it was good. It was a very thin small patty maybe the same size as a Whopper Jr beef patty I guessing a two oz. patty. I do note the patty was cooked nice but not so tasty. The bun was soft and eggy tasting but a lot of bread for the little patty that didn't fill the bun. My egg slice was cooked very hard and was chalky. It was sort of messy with thousand Island dressing squirting out all over.  Depending on how you look at it the burger was really good if you compare it to a Whopper Jr but it cost like 5x more or it's lousy if you compare it to a burger you cooked in a pan or on the grill.  I should have went with the Chinese Style Chicken salad with canned oranges on it.  2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"My son and I had Modern Burger on the way out and on the way home from a family celebration. He had the Simple Hot Dog the first time, and the Breakfast Burger the way back. I tried the Breakfast Sandwich, which is distinguished by avocado!  The fries are perfect and fresh from the oil. The burgers are full of umami goodness and the bacon is both crisp and chewy. For a few wonderful moments I had no sorrow about being in an airport. I would almost fly American again just to change planes by these guys."}
{"text":"Food is actually good - as long as you can deal with pretty terrible service. Super slow and they forget to make simple things - waited for my drink for over 10 minutes...thinking they were busy but they just forgot it and when I finally asked - not even an apology. Won't go back - lots of better Sky Harbor options with attentive staff."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger for an airport. Phx airport now has all local restaurants and this is one of them. Try it with a fried egg"}
{"text":"i like it where you can try the food without spending a arm or leg  it looks like Modern Steak cooks the burgers then deliver to Modern Burger  the two little burgers that comes in one order were delish.  and the fries were just done right"}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. I cannot imagine why anybody is impressed by this place at all. The service is meh, the burger was mediocre at best. Fast food patty on a fat bun.  A fat bun? Yes. The bun is soaked in butter and almost an inch of bread on either side of a mcdonalds thin patty. My burger was pink, is that even safe? There weren't that many people there yet they forgot my grilled onions. Normally I'd say something but it became obvious after two bites it would suck with or without onions, so whatever. The taste I see people raving about is steak salt. Fries are ok. Not sure why everyone says the tomato and lettuce are so super fresh, I mean it's not rubber but I wouldn't call it fresh either.  If I come through Phoenix again I'll try something besides the Modern Burger, I think the only \"modern\" thing about it was trying to sell people a shitty product for more money."}
{"text":"Got an excellent salad to go and a sparkling water.  Thought it was great that she asked me if I knew it was sparkling water instead of flat.  I know it may sound weird, but it looks the same as flat waster, so I appreciate the time she took to make sure I grabbed the right item."}
{"text":"I never thought I would give an airport burger place a 5 stars. Yes, it was a perfectly cooked bacon double cheeseburger. Better than Five Guys, better than most burger joints I have been to.   They really care that you have a good experience even though you are passing through and may never be back. For me, I'll be back because I go to Phoenix a lot.   The manager also made a difference. He actually walked by and asked customers how their food was -  like it was a high end restaurant. He then remembered me when I got in line again for another drink.   Fast service, good burgers, good fries."}
{"text":"Frodo Baggins called.  Even he thinks you guys skimp on your portions.  Don't get me wrong, the burgers are great.  Some of the best in Phoenix.  But by the time you are getting your pace up to really savor the flavor, your little box is empty. They are tasty but I believe Fox, once again, has put style over substance and out thought itself."}
{"text":"Good hotdog, ridiculous policy.   Bought a hotdog to eat. They wrapped it in silver paper and started to put it in a bag. I said no bag, and they said they have to put it in a bag and that it's policy!  Policy!  If I want to save a tree, they won't let me?  How stupid is that?"}
{"text":"Okay I have a goal to write more yelp reviews so why not start now? Place is good. One cashier was friendlier than the other when I was there (I got the lesser friendly one). Great value for airport food but it didn't blow me away. I will eat there again but I probably wouldn't go there if It wasn't at the airport and I had more choices."}
{"text":"An ok burger, but not quality.  Bun was nice as were the fries and shake, but burger was not 100% beef.  It was kind of soggy and looked unappealing.  Taste was ok...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"First of all, finding anything to eat in an airport for under 10 or 11 bucks is a miracle. Finding something GOOD to eat even more of a miracle. Got a single burger with grilled onions and it was pretty dang delicious. I fully expect to eat here again on my next layover."}
{"text":"A place that inspires me to decorate my house like the bathroom must be reviewed!   Modern Burger is an adorable little restaurant, perfect for happy hour after an afternoon shopping at Fashion Square.   The sliders, fries, ice cream sandwiches, and chopped turkey salad are perfect. Everything from the portion size to the price to the presentation is wonderful.   They have changed their happy hour since my last visit, so I need to go back soon. But I will be going back and that is the important thing."}
{"text":"First of all I am overly excited that Scottsdale Mall has added this lovely addition of an West wing.  I was starting to think that Neiman's was as good as it would get *shivers* Barneys! My wallet just can't contain itself.  Anyways the little window is sexy.Hell it caught my attention.  The fresh flowers modernly placed.  can you tell I'm an architect? ..and the workers aren't that bad either. I love their selection of food..clean cut \"modern\" makes sense...The water selection is vast, but who are you kidding? You're there for the lemonade! Do light Ice you'll get more lol.  (Don't be fooled by the water by the way...it's just Nestle Pure Life water...in a fancy bottle and some mineral flavoring *yum*) But the sliders...the sliders...soft warm perfect buns perfectly pairs.  The sauce...dripping devilshly down the little, but supple meaty bulge.  don't bother with the lettuce.  It's cleverly advertised at \"Iceburg\" cause..we all know Iceburg is NOT lettuce.  I'm going on about this, but honestly this place was awesome.  I knocked it one star only because it is NOT a lunch break meal! Do not waltz there thinking that you will be in and out.  (Get the pun) These burgers are made with tender hands...and lots of love.  Patiently wait with some Perrier and enjoy the people watching.. Sweetie...Louis Vuitton and Prada do not match.  Designers need to put labels on their products.  \"Do not swallow, keep away from the fashion-ally challenged, Toss after ONE year.\"  30th review!"}
{"text":"The A5 breakfast sandwich is awesome!!  Egg, cheese, avocado, bacon and tomato (I don't like tomato, so I get it without it). The bun is so soft and delicious!  A must have sandwich if at Sky Harbor at breakfast time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast burger and the smoothie of the month (which was double chocolate-strawberry). The burger had plentiful portions and tasted yummy. I was pleasantly surprised!!! Price was $7.50 & smoothie was $5.   The staff were friendly. The only bad thing about this place is the non existing seating area.  Apart from that it is a great place to catch a good American burger while waiting for a layover or picking up a quick bite onto your next flight."}
{"text":"If I'm craving a slider on the go while shopping at the mall, this is a great go-to place. I can order two sliders for an incredibly reasonable price and everything else is a la carte. They sell salads, fries, sliders and sodas here -- all of which are tasty. Modern Burger is a great concept considering that many times, someone who is shopping at the mall gets hungry but doesn't necessarily want to sit down and eat.   I'm still trying to figure out Modern Burger's hours because it's always a hit or miss if they are open or not."}
{"text":"Modern Burger is a little blue burger window inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, alongside the latest Sam Fox venture, Modern Steak.  I visited three times before I found Modern Burger open, and on that visit the place quickly closed up as they called my name and I grabbed the bag of food.  There are five items on the menu. Orders are placed at the window.  On this visit, the window was crowded with four teen-somethings who refused to move as the staff looked on helplessly. Finally, a look was thrown in their direction and two of them moved while the others continued to hang out.  After ordering, customers can sit at one of the two communal tables and wait to be called. The food is served in a paper sack, ala fast food style.  While I waited, one of the staff approached me and asked if I needed ketchup. As I shook my head and replied, he slammed down several packets of ketchup and hustled off. There is nothing like sharp and attentive service to make you feel valued.  But I have to say that the food was pretty darn tasty, starting with the Chopped Turkey Salad ($5.75). While it did come pre-made out of a refrigerator, the freshness was still present. Chopped lettuce, roasted turkey and corn, tomato, cucumber, cheddar and boiled egg, while fresh, were all sadly under dressed. A small container of dressing was provided, but since the place had closed, more could not be requested.  The Sliders ($5.75) came two to an order and are, as you'd expect, two small burgers. They're served on a house-made bun, which is more like focaccia bread rather than something more traditional. The beef was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy. In fact, it was so juicy that the lack of napkins became apparent, and with no one to ask..   The top-notch house fries were perfectly seasoned on the salty side and had a nice toothsome crunch.  For dessert, Modern Burger offers ice cream sandwiches ($2.75), but once more we were denied since the place had closed.  The food was tasty but, with strange hours and crude service, I can't understand why they even opened. The place seems more like an afterthought."}
{"text":"Simply put, the sliders taste like mini \"Big Macs,\" which is just fine with me.  For what I got, I felt the prices could have been a little bit cheaper, but I'm glad that I made the effort to find this literal hole-in-the-wall burger place."}
{"text":"Burgers ate ok. The quarter pound single must shrink a TON from raw as the meat didn't cover more that 2/3rds of the bun.  ... Flavor was pretty good for a greasy spoon style, well done ( your only option) burger. Reasonable price for the burgers, for airport food.   Fries were over seasoned and not crispy... They'd been clearly sitting under heat lamp for a while... Some were nearly soggy. I don't like overdone fries but having them crisp on the outside would be nice considering the super high price (almost the cost of the burger) for a side of fries.    Kids meals are good/properly priced  Btw... While the name suggests it, Nothing \"modern\" about the food, only the facade/decor of the counter."}
{"text":"Layover from Orange County, CA to Orlando, FL. After flying for literally only 45 minutes, I was a bit peckish! Decided to try a \"Modern Burger Kids Meal\".... Boy was that an understatement! I wasn't \"THAT\" hungry, until my order came out. Big, juicy, and well seasoned burger, with delightfully tasty fries! Reminded me a lot of Shake Shack.  Awesome place to grab a bite if you are in the airport!"}
{"text":"Burger...No I bought a Hot Dog here. Yes and a Chicago Dog at that disguised as their Modern Dog on their menu. Poppy seed bun, glow in the dark relish,sport peppers, onions, tomatoes and mustard...all for $5.75... at the airport. Located between A4 and A5 gates for American. A great deal!!! Yes hamburgers, fries and shakes available at reasonable price$."}
{"text":"i've been lucky enough to visit here a few times, and each time, MB did NOT disappoint..!  the \"A5 breakfast sandwich\" is awesome.  egg, cheese, bacon, avocado, mayo on a soft brioche bun.....mmmmmmm, yummy!   the breakfast burger also delish.  other people say it's at \"terminal 4\".  CORRECTION- it's at terminal A, near gate 1.    screw all the other airport food joints.  THIS is the place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"We had a breakfast sandwich (with avocado) and breakfast burger. Both were good. Better than most airport food."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the rave about this place is!?  Came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and ordered the single burger with some fries.  The gal at the counter was super nice and cool.    However, I can't say the same for the burger.  Pretty simple one patty burger with tomatoes, onions, and pickles....um...yeah that's about it.  My patty was not super dry, but darn close.  The bun was you basic hamburger bun.  So really why does it cost what it cost for such a simple burger.  Because it's made with a \"modern\" grill?  I could get the same at Mc'ds and be more content and plus at least I'll get a toy with it in a pretty box.  Mines with in a brown bag with Modern Burger stamp....yahhhh....... :(  Overall, I'm baffle why people would compare this burger as one of the best in town.  Shame on you fools!  I wasn't even in a bad mood when I came  -- was totally in an awesome mood so nope -- last time I checked I don't have those time of the months.  Maybe someday I'll feel to give this a try, but for now; sorry folks can't recommend - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My breakfast sandwich was amaze balls!!!!! I've never had something so soft and so flavorful. The bread was so fresh and the avocado and the egg and bacon... I want another one now. Definitely hitting this place up again on my flights back home"}
{"text":"Thick bun, skinny patties and shredded lettuce are always a bit disappointing for me. Burger had decent flavor but was on the greasy side."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating here multiple times.  I love the single burger - the meat is always juicy and the bun is fresh and tasty!  Last time I was there I got a breakfast burger - and it was a little too much for me.  Very rich and too much to eat.  But I love the single burger!"}
{"text":"Well, someone beat me in being the first to write a review for this burger joint at the airport.  Wondering around looking for a place, my options were not appealing to my taste buds because the option were very limited at the airport, or at least at  the concourse I was in.  I approached the information desk and asked for guidance and was ask , are you looking to a Burger King? Oh heck no something wayyyyyyy better.  I was directed to Modern Burger which meant 4 moving walkways from my location which would mean a total of 8 (round trip) UGH! I still went for it.  I was not disappointed, the burger was good but its the bread or bun that makes this hamburger. It has the slight sweetness of a brioche. mmmmmmmmmm. The fries? crispy and seasoned.  I did not have a milkshake but not like I needed it since there Iced Tea was enough for me.  Why 4 and not 5 stars? The wait on the first visit was alittle too long, orders are made fresh to order but still I had a chance to sit down and eat as well as catch my plane.  On my layover, guess what I did? Yep headed back to Modern Burger for a redo of my previous order. This place will be on my radar for a few months as I head to Arizona for business and luckily my layover is in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. Crispy outside and still juicy. Really good toppings were all fresh and so was the bun. Too bad my fries weren't as fresh as the burger."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of burger, but I enjoyed their option of adding an egg in burgers. The french fries were a bit too salty for me. Nevertheless, it's a wonderful place to dine in an airport."}
{"text":"Yummy!  So tasty and unexpected while I wait for my connector at the airport back to oc.  The bun was grilled and just buttery enough to produce a nice crunch when you bite into it.  The breakfast burger was sensational. A beautiful blend of texture and flavors.    The staff are loud but funny, laughing and having fun with each other and the customers. They make a good team."}
{"text":"One of the best places to at Sky Harbor.  Really enjoyed the breakfast burger.  The fried egg, bacon, patty, and their toppings makes a really tasty meal.  The hot dog is really good too.  The ordering / wait area is small and can get congested when it gets busy and service slows down."}
{"text":"Food (4 stars): I got a breakfast burger with melted cheese, egg, bacon and lettuce, how could you go wrong? It was $6 and good airport food.   It is your typical fast food joint, where you walk to the counter and order what item you wanted on the menu. I would come back here again if I am ever in the PHX."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever seen! Large advertisement about cookies and cream shake. When I tried to order it she said that don't have it. Then I asked how long and just got a shoulder shrug. She generally didn't give a crap even though she is one of the service. Never going there again!!!,.....especially with Blanco on the Fly next door"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and relatively inexpensive for airport food! The burgers are fresh and yummy and the employees are friendly. They got our food out quickly and we really liked the seasoning on the fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best burger!! Maybe even better than In and Out due to the brioche bun. I rarely eat burgers, but these are irresistible.  Their breakfast sandwich is the best breakfast sandwich at Sky Harbor. Also, the fries are delicious, fresh and crisp every time."}
{"text":"Whoa, good airport food!  Burgers made to order with fresh toppings and a good bun! They also can also put 1000 Island dressing (Yes!). I thought that for a $5.50 airport burger, this was great quality and taste. The fries were your standard fries, and no complaints. Seating is a bit sparse, but there's other places you can go to around because it's attached to other restaurants. Bar seating has outlets."}
{"text":"If you called me tonight in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and told me you wanted me to fly to Phoenix tomorrow - I wouldn't hesitate as long as I could hit Modern Burger for a Breakfast Burger at Sky Harbor!  Seriously, I've mentioned this before - I think on Yelp - this is an amazing burger.  One that truly defines worthwhile airport food.  A burger without an egg is just a burger.  Oh, and hypothetically, I would be willing to fly back the same day..."}
{"text":"I have aged significantly since ordering my fries. Just waited 30 minutes for 1 order of french fries!! Reminded them 3 times.... the fries are mediocre but not worth the wrinkles."}
{"text":"Modern Burger...just the name lifts your expectations if not your curiosity. Unfortunately, whatever hope I had for new, delightful, and different was crushed by reality - its just a facade, a marketing ploy to whip your senses into gear for yet another burger and fries, charge more for it, and, if you follow that line of thinking its more tax revenue - and that is partially why its not a BK. But,  this is all ok, its just par for the course. (I did fall for it, but I remember the Alamo!...so to speak).  What is Modern Burger @ PHX Int. Airport?  - Modern fastfood, modern only in name, high price being its true differentiator (relative to twin arches).    - Small seating area accommodates those wishing to dwell...Kitty corner view of TV at neighboring edtablishment   - Music - The Feelies \"Modern Rythms\", a pioneer of the early 89s alternative sound, true standout!         - http://www.thefeeliesweb.com       - (thank you Shazam!)       - TY MB!..you've totally redeemed yourself!  - Double Bacon Cheese Burger - LTO...greasy, cheesy mess...taste is closest to 5 Guys...I prefer grilled patties to the fried variety....they forgot the L and T so I got that on the side, upside was it was cold..(Take note MB, that's how Root Burger does it, works!)... overall ok, I'd hoped for better. Ate 3 qtrs.  - Fries were excellent - bright spot  - Chocolate shake was basically unmemorable and totally bland  SUMMARY:  $18...eh...not so great for that price, this was a double though. Good place if you need to eat and run and your expectations are just that."}
{"text":"After an over night flight from Hawaii this place was my breakfast haven. Naturally I ordered a breakfast burger and my only disappointment was that I didn't get fried too!  The burger was everything I like in a burger, juicy and flavorful. It was like a BLT on crack really. Personally if a burger isn't messy to eat, than its too dry. Just my opinion and I ate this burger from its wrapper to minimize the mess in public. I mean I am a lady.   I also thought the price was reasonable. Actually I thought it was cheap but I did just return from the land of the $5 ice tea and $16 omelettes.   In short, stop by and grab a burger when you are hungry. I don't think you will be disappointed. Notice, no photo. It was too good to stop eating."}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport burger. It's not in and out, but a decent impostor. I'll def eat here again in the dreaded situation I end up in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Same awesome sliders & fries from Modern steak but to go?  WHY do you do this to me, Sam Fox?  It's not like I have the willpower to order that salad!"}
{"text":"On my flight delay, I stopped by to eat modern burger. The burger patty was quality meat, but the burger it self was a little too oily for me. The bun is quite different from any other burger. Overall pretty good, I ordered a double party burger costing around $7.15 just for the burger."}
{"text":"Burger was good, but the thousand island sauce was NASTY!  Fries good too and reasonable price. Just skip the 10k sauce!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite to eat before walking around the mall with friends. I've always wanted to try the quick take-out window and see how Sam Fox does \"fast food\" haha. The four of us bought two orders of sliders (4) and two orders of fries.   About 5 minutes later they called our orders and we walked up to grab them. I liked their packaging, all white from the bag and napkins to the box that the sliders were in.   The fries were pretty good. Cooked just fine, perfectly crispy on the outside. There was a nice touch though.... they were seasoned perfectly. I had mine without ketchup. Working at In-N-Out for 5 years had taught me that a perfectly seasoned fry doesn't need ketchup, and Fox nailed this one. The larger grain, kosher salt was the finishing touch on the fries.  The sliders were simple, and... alright. The bun was great. You could tell it was made in-house and fresh. It was light, and a little sweet. The beef was fresh and tasty. The toppings of lettuce, grilled onions and cheddar cheese were good. Simple, but good. However the 1000 Island dressing was just that... From the culinary experts that Sam Fox has stashed in his kitchens, this tasted like 1000 Island from a bottle that was purchased at Safeway. It's not hard to make 1000 Island dressing, or something similar, and I kind of expected that. The sauce reminded me of a Big Mac, seriously. That's not meant to be a huge insult on Modern Burger, but it's what it reminded me of. The rest of the burger reminded me of a mini version of an In-N-Out burger, which is great.   Two sliders, one order of fries and a water: $8.99. Not bad. If I were a mall employee, I would probably eat this a few times a week. Also, if I was shopping and wanted to avoid the masses at the food court, I would definitely stop by Modern Burger.   Concept/Service: 4 Stars Burger: 3 Stars Fries: 4 Stars  I'll be back when I'm hungry and in the mall."}
{"text":"Waiting on a connection to Vegas I decided to check them out. The cashier was friendly, but was rushing and kept having to reask me the same questions of what I wanted on the burger. Dbl bacon, Well done, pickle, lettuce, grilled onions, I requested mustard, but you apply that yourself. I also got fries and a bottled water. Order came to $16 and change. HIGHWAY ROBBERY....   Fries alone were $3.25, they were warm, and just ok. The burger was good. Not well done enough for me tho. When I picked the burger up the paper was stuck to the bottom and tore half the bun from the wet lettuce and grilled onions. It was too much of something. I'd subtract the lettuce and get raw onions next time. For the price it was just ok."}
{"text":"During my 2 hour layover in Phoenix, the choices were great like at O'Hare!  I ate an already prepared Chopped Turkey Salad. The ingredients were fresh, which is about all you can ask for at an airport. It was a bit pricey at $9.75, but less expensive than other food places here.   They have an island where I was able to eat and recharge my phone which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"If I ever sing to you or about you, realize that you are loved. Now, this isn't your typical, halfhearted, fleeting type of love. No, no, this love...is nothing but the purest, most fulfilling love you well ever experience on this entire planet.  Modern Burger, I sang to your sliders. Juicy, melt in your mouth, mini beef patties, and the buns, oh baby those buns! I sang to the fries too, with their fresh and crispy deliciousness. With Kosher salt too?! There isn't a better salt to use if you ask me.   Hey, I've got plenty of this awesome love to go around! ...and man oh man do these heaven for the palate sliders and fries deserve it!"}
{"text":"For airport this is pretty excellent.  It's fresh but a little messy.  Only has 7 seats at the counter and 2 tables for 2.  Chocolate shake is definitely Hershey flavored versus regular chocolate.  Fries are flavored with seasoned salt if that's not your thing.  Worth it in my opinion.  My food came in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"First off, decent service if you need to grab something quick to catch a flight.  It took 9 minutes from ordering to getting your food.    The burger was good, a gourmet burger delivered quickly into your hands. Definitely cooked after you order.  Nothing great, but solid for grabbing something at an airport.  Didn't care for the fries, but the shake was pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for a burger that ran out of Cheese.  Ordered the double burger with bacon and no sauce and fries.  It came out to $12 around.  Fries were good, they tasted like lawry's salt on them.  Good thing I saved a can of coke during my first flight so that i didn't have to pay for soda."}
{"text":"Single cheese burger with fries and a shake for $16.29. Worse ambiance than McDonald's. Service is pretty bad for the price. I'd be ok with impatient, careless, lazy service for $10, but $16 I regretted not going to the Mexican place next door where the servers seemed to be pleasant. Take a 4 minute walk to Gate B and go to Wendy's if you want a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Best airport burger I've had (been to about 20 airports in the last year, some multiple times), and comparable to the quality and taste of most real sit-down restaurants that are available in these bastions of cattle herding known as air travel.  and it's actually reasonable prices (for an airport) - around $5 for the burger itself which is probably the best tasting one you can get at any restaurant inside PHX. add a bit more for fries and/or a drink.  I went for the chocolate shake myself instead of the other side options and it was damn tasty.  never will I settle for a Burger King or McDonalds in a smelly terminal again.   reasonably quick too, though not a ton of seating there is plenty in the two adjacent food service stops (all owned by the same folks so you can more or less sit anywhere you like.  Thank you Phoenix Sky Harbor for adding this place!!  would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Modern Burger in old west airport terminal A. Not sure which part of it is modern between beef, tomato, lettuce, thousand islands, grilled or raw onion and optional cheese bacon and egg......maybe the egg part! Well, decent burger and definitely fresher than the big chains. $5 single burger seems quite reasonable for airport food."}
{"text":"For an expensive burger in the morning with the necessary egg on it like you get in Philly and Jersey, you have to come here and have this option prior to flying to any destination. The service is in general friendly but I do think that since there is very limited seating in the venue, they should allow you to have your meal seated in their sister restaurant next door---) Blanco. They would only need to ask at the time of purchase whether or not you desire to eat in or take it away. On two visits here, I found no seating and no offer to accommodate me once I purchased my grub. I may have to rethink being a regular if I cannot sit and eat. Just saying."}
{"text":"For airport food this was not bad at all.  I ordered the BLT with fries and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The BLT had a ton of bacon with shredded lettuce (which I like), fresh tomatoes and was served on this really good brioche bun.  They do have breakfast burgers along with regular and unique burgers.  I will visit again when connecting in Phoenix."}
{"text":"hands down the best deal in sky harbor! this quality/ price algorithm is through the roof here, fast service and probably the best fully loaded grilled dog you will find for $5.25 in ANY airport"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the Sliders themselves deserves five stars, but I just can't recommend Modern Burger.   I was jonesing for a burger for lunch today, and I've read good things about this place. So I decided to give it a try since I don't live too far from Scottsdale Fashion Square. The menu is small and simple. Two sliders, a chopped turkey salad, fries, and ice cream sandwiches.   The sliders are an okay size, but not very filling on their own. Think of it as an In-N-Burger single patty cheeseburger (same fixings, but much higher quality meat and bread), but a tad smaller and nearly twice the price. You could make up for this by ordering fries. However, I was completely unsatisfied by Modern Burger's fries. They were just way too plain.   The concept also doesn't work well. It's a take out window from a fine dining restaurant inside the mall. There's really nowhere to wait for your food except at the window where you ordered.  That wouldn't be too bad, but it takes about five minutes or so to get your food.  There's also just a couple of benches to eat at. This would work better if Modern Burger was closer to the food court. I don't want to park my car, walk through the mall, and take the food somewhere else.   Modern Burger is worth a try. But I'll only eat there again if I happen to be walking through the mall, and feel like having a burger."}
{"text":"Now for a cool taste experience modern burger isn't exactly the future of burgers but the taste and price make it worth it especially at the airport"}
{"text":"10/07/10  2 stars for the food...  Popped over to Modern Steak to have their HH (happy hour) $2 sliders, and instead found that the prices have increased (2 for $6, I believe).  I'd wanted to try their truffle fries, but thought I'd try the fries at Modern Burger first to have something to compare the truffle fries to the next time I visit.  The sliders ($5.75 for two, but I might be wrong) tasted like they did in the past and were the same size as those I had during happy hour.  So why the increase at Modern Steak?  The fries were soggy, and therefore were horrible (to me!), and I wonder if the truffle fries are even worth coming back for, now?    Service was friendly and accomodating, so I'm adding an extra star!"}
{"text":"Yooooo!!! Flan! Caramel Flan!!!!! What more can I say? Top Billin'  I ordered a quesadilla d/t price point & hunger. It was greasy but good. For $8 & change I didn't even have to pay extra for sour cream and salsa! That was a welcome surprise.  I paid for my quesadilla & stepped to the side to wait for it when I laid eyes on....YES!!! You guessed it love - Flan (One of my favorite desserts - depending on how I am feeling) I look for flan literally EVERYWHERE so what a find. A little overpriced for the 1/2 cup serving but was well worth it to me in the moment. I am really contemplating buying another. For now I will just sit here waiting patiently for my flight."}
{"text":"I tend to stay away from airport food (especially quick service) because it's usually a big trap and what you get never seem to match what you just paid for it. Modern Burger restored my faith (if there ever was faith there to begin with) with its reasonable prices, fast service, and most importantly: seemingly really good food.  Have I lost you yet? Good food from a quick service counter in an airport? I do have to say that being absolutely starving after having landed for a layover and not really expecting too much has a lot to do with it. Modern Burger was right by the gate I exited out of and being a burger guy through and through it seemed like a sign from heaven.  I got the Breakfast Burger and it ended up being about $8 with the addition of a fried egg. Fries and a drink would've been an additional $3. The burger was cooked well, flavorful, and hit the spot. I didn't have to wait long either which justified me getting the burger in the first place knowing full well how short of a layover time I had.  Check it out if you ever find yourself passing by here. Definitely gave me enough fuel to endure a long flight. I've yet to find better quality/tasting airport quick service food."}
{"text":"I discovered this place during a layover in the Phoenix airport. At the time I was just happy to find a place that was still serving food after 10pm (had to walk all the way from the B gates to the A gates on my journey for dinner). The burger was pretty good and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste. Price wise my whole meal (single burger, fries and a drink) came to $12. I would definitely eat here again if I ever find myself back at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"I nearly fell over when I saw Modern Burger in Terminal 4 of PHX this morning. It was 7:30am, and all I could think was, Burger for Breakfast? Yes please.   There aren't too many days I can pull off eating a burger in the morning so when I had the chance, I jumped on it.   The cashier was friendly and the burger came out quick. Too quick actually. I knew then that it wasn't going to be the best burger ever, and I was right, but it sufficed.   The Breakfast Burger had a little beef patty that was just a notch above a typical fast food chain in quality. There's also some kind of sauce on it that I didn't care for. On the bright side, the lettuce and tomato tasted fresh, and the bacon was think cut and very good. Having a fried egg on a burger is rarely a bad thing either.   Not the worst place for an airport burger fix. It hit the spot, while also making me feel like I was living on the edge just a bit.   Although, I wouldn't rush to have this Breakfast Burger again... if you want to rebel against morning, I also wouldn't dissuade you."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a burger with nothing on it? Just don't put anything on it. Not onions. Not thousand island. Not tomatoes. Well you get the idea. Not like I've got a lot of time in an airport terminal to wait for another.  Burgers made from standard frozen Sysco foods most likely. Not exactly the farm fresh image they try to project. If you have time, walk to another terminal."}
{"text":"Great burger for an airport locations."}
{"text":"I was hungry and didn't feel like going to a sit down restaurant for airport breakfast and also didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for whatever I ate. Compared to other similar breakfast choices Modern Burger was a good option for me. I had the breakfast sandwich: a bacon, egg, avocado and cheese sandwich on a burger bun. It was made in a speedy amount of time and was very filling. The bun was soft and a bit oily, the bacon crisp, and there were large chunks of avocado in the filling. The total was around $8 which is slightly cheaper and had more substance than similar offerings at other restaurants here.   Overall it was a pretty good sandwich and I'd come here again if I wanted a burger or breakfast at the airport."}
{"text":"Pretty quick service for the airport, staff is super happy and friendly. Definitely not a hassle for this $5 burger!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox is taking over the airport! It's nice to see more local businesses at Sky Harbor. You really can't lose with a Fox restaurant on or off airport property. I challenge any Sun Devil to do what this man has done ;)  Seriously though, if you are passing through PHX and using Yelp and trying to decide what to do for food in the A concourse, do this or .....Olive and Ivy another Fox joint."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my Bacon Double Cheeseburger and fries from here!  Modern Burger is located next to Gate A3. I only has about 20 minutes until boarding time for my connecting flight at A5 so I was a little worried whether I'd have enough time to wait for my food and wolf it down before boarding.  Modern Burger is a small shop located between several much larger restaurants but it was still busy.  The cashier and staff looked efficient and so I went for it.  I was pleasantly surprised that my number was called in just about 5 minutes.  The fries were golden crispy and nicely salted.  The burger was about the size of an In-n-Out Double Double.  In other words, just the right size for not feeling disgusted with yourself afterwards.  The patties were juicy and nicely salty from the extra crispy bacon.  You could tell the cheese had been perfectly melted on the patties on the grill.  I'd say this is a 3 napkin burger.  Juicy and a little greasy just like you guiltily want it.  You'd probably annoy the guy sitting next to you on the plane for eating this in your cramped seat.  But screw it.  He's just jealous!"}
{"text":"A real, delicious burger topped with yummy grilled onions - in the Phoenix airport! This was a surprise and a true holiday miracle while hungry and slogging along on our cross-country Christmas travel. Made fresh to order and the service was very quick. The seasoned fries were really yummy too! A great bonus. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The menu and prices were very reasonable, especially with the usual inflated airport prices. I only had a vanilla milkshake which wasn't that great but the other food options looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Not all food at airports is expensive but most of it is.  Getting ready to get on a flight at Thanksgiving time usually means crowds and very packed restaurants.  That's exactly what it was like.  There would be no way you'd be able to find a table to sit down at without a long wait.  Thus, the search was on for a hamburger.  Not wanting to pay $15 for the one offered at the closest restaurant I decided to do a little walking and discovered Modern Burger.  The sign advertised their single burger at $5!!  That's almost unheard of for a hamburger at the airport.  The line wasn't too long so I was all in for it.  The only issue with the line was the customer ahead of me.  I thought he must have been ordering for the whole airplane.  He took forever.  Food was fast coming out and the hamburger was really good.  Since we fly a lot out of the Phoenix airport, I'm glad to have discovered it.  I'm also sure I'll be back.  Hopefully, there won't be someone ahead of me in line who takes forever to order again.  There actually should have been another person taking orders since everyone behind me also had a flight to catch."}
{"text":"Decent burger (comes with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, and thousand island dressing) but I'd say slightly overpriced for nothing amazing. $5 for a single burger (no fries included). I added a fried egg for $1, which is definitely worth it cuz it made the burger way better. And splurged on the shake of the month (candy cane) for $5. The shake was surprisingly rly good though :)   I guess it's a decent place for a quick airport meal"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers in Phoenix....and it's in the airport! Service can be lacking at times but hey it's an airport. I eat here every time I fly out of AZ"}
{"text":"Do NOT get the Butterfingers \"Shake of the Month,\" as it is too thick to suck out of a straw. I was hoping for the consistency of a shake like those at McDonald's, but it was too thick and too late to exchange it, as I had to get on the plane. Very disappointed. *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT when I initially ate it. Egg + burger + in n out like sauce + grilled onions + affordable pricing in an AIRPORT = heaven. However, I believe I got a stomach flu from this joint. I hadn't eaten anything other than my burger at Modern Burger, and when I flew back to my home city I experienced the worst sort of nausea EVER. Up came the burger and all it's leftovers. Sick.  Eeek!! Methinks not so much."}
{"text":"The most amazing BLTs ever! Truly a bacon lovers delight. A really great alternative to normal airport food and burgers (tho' their burgers are great too). And the price is right - not the usual inflated airport prices. I plan my layovers in PHX around getting a BLT  at Modern Burger. They are always busy but they crank out the food really fast."}
{"text":"Double lettuce wrapped cheeseburger and fries were surprisingly good. Time to receive food was adequate and service was good. If I was rating on the fact that it was airport food it would be five stars."}
{"text":"Meh.  The burger was flat and dry. The bread was thick and not toasted.  Best things were the chocolate shake and fries."}
{"text":"Burgers are small but really delicious!!!! Buns are grilled and buttered. Fresh meat and melted cheese.. We had to order one more.. And the service is fast. In short, great burgers.."}
{"text":"A nice little burger joint in Phoenix terminal A concourse.   The food was actually quite good, the double burger was beyond juicy and tasteful while the seasoned fries were excellent.  The operational layout is what leaves a bit to be desired.  It has a walk up counter order area that is also your pick up area when they call your number.  There is not enough space for both of these operations to occur smoothly in that small spot.    If it's not crowded, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Actually more than adequate for airport food and the staff was pleasant... which is always a nice surprise when choking down airport fare. My burger was freshly made, bun was tasty and the toppings were also fresh. The speed of delivery was excellent. While I did not have a milk shake a couple seated next to me were thrilled with theirs. While these burgers (or atmosphere) may not match up favorably with other free standing super burger settings, this is a good choice for burger fans who are on the run. If you're looking for a better burger when in the Phoenix airport, give Modern Burger a spin!"}
{"text":"It's airport food so I wasn't expecting much. But the bacon in my BLT was thick cut, it was delicious and they weren't miserly about it. The right amount of all the rest of the ingredients and as I take my last bite they announce that they're boarding my group. Toss my trash and I'm headin' home.   Perfect!  2013 #47 / 365"}
{"text":"A nice, quick, easy meal. I shared an order of burgers and fries and it filled me up for lunch. From my previous experiences when I have had sliders they are usually over cooked, but this was not the case at all. The fries are also tasty.   The seating was minimal, but I went at a good time I guess so it was not a problem for me. The price is also good, especially for how much food they give you in one order."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best BLT I've ever had....seriously. the BEST.  I look forward to layovers in Phoenix just for this sandwich.  Service was fast, the gal taking orders was courteous and the food was great."}
{"text":"I was so sad when Modern Burger closed at Fashion Square, but I'm glad it's found a home at Sky Harbor.  If I'm eating at the airport, I'm generally eating here. I've even stopped here before heading home after arriving at Sky Harbor.  The burger is perfect. Well-seasoned, perfect amount of sauce and cheese, and just enough grilled onion.   Considering it's the airport, I don't think their prices are crazy.  Also, if you are remotely a fan of rice krispy treats, do yourself  a favor and get one of their salted caramel rice krispy treats."}
{"text":"Great burger and the kid's meal is plenty of food for just $6"}
{"text":"It surprising to find a good salad at the airport. Fast friendly and efficient. The salad was excellent and we had time to eat it because the service was so fast. We will eat here again."}
{"text":"Modern Burger at the airport is awesome. I tried the breakfast sandwich last month and the cheeseburger last week. It is all good and the staff is great."}
{"text":"stranded again at SKY HARBOR -- gotta love US AIRWAYS ...  what a nice surprise MODERN BURGER turned out to be. if you can get beyond lunch costing as much as a new car (hey, in an airport you're a captive audience) the food and service were both good. the fries were tasty and the burgers close to IN-AND-OUT and that's high praise indeed.    so, if you fly US AIRWAYS and get stuck in PHOENIX (and if you fly US AIRWAYS you're gonna get stuck somewhere) and you're up for burgers and fries, check out MODERN BURGER."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for our flight out of Phoenix. Let me get this out of the way, customer service here was HORRIBLE. Like your worst nightmare horrible. The lady at the counter actually looked like she wanted to stab me for ordering something. No joke. While we were eating our food one of her coworkers actually yelled something very profane. That's the kind of establishment you're dealing with.   However, the food was pretty good for airport food. Not the best burger you'll have, but overall pretty good. I simply had a cheeseburger and it wasn't overly priced and was decent enough.   If you're in this airport and have some time to kill while being hungry, I'd suggest this place unless you can find something better."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and a reasonably priced tasty cheese burger. Exactly what you want and need when you have a quick connection."}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food. Maybe just good but I was starved.  Grabbed a single with grilled onions, cheese, lettuce and tomato only. No mayo or 1000 island.   Burger was cooked just right not too dry. It had the right about  of salt and pepper.    Biggest complaint is it went to quick"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick meal if you are shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (it beats the food court). I certainly wouldn't go out of my way just for their burgers, which remind me a little of White Castle back in the day.   Is there a White Castle anywhere near the valley?"}
{"text":"This this place is awesome! I came here on the advice of a flight attendant, she told me about this place when I asked her is there any good place to eat when I get to Phoenix.  I was blow away, the breakfast sandwich off the hook! If I'm ever at Sky Harbor airport again I'm defiantly will be eating here."}
{"text":"Modern Burger - I hesitated , but decided on a double. Incredible! Loaded with flavor. So good I was even impressed- that good- never heard of this place before- must try for sure. I should have taken a picture of this beauty but is was eaten so quickly. Must try if your in terminal A near gate 4 Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport"}
{"text":"Hit up Modern Burger with Jason W. and Deb S. yesterday. I totally think this needs a separate designation from Modern Steak as it's quite different and for what it is, it's good...  It's basically a window in the side of Sam Fox's new place, Modern Steak. I think they do a couple of salads but I really didn't pay too much attention. We were there for the sliders.   They are....uh, basically....awesome! Two sliders of fresh ground beef, a house made bun (crazy foccacia looking one), American cheese, grilled onions, 1000 island & iceberg lettuce.  I'm hot & cold on Fox spots but I'm in love with Modern Burger's sliders. The beef was awesome. Super moist, juicy & flavorful. Cooked in butter??? The rest of the compliments were great. I was particularly impressed with the bun. First of all for some crazy reason, I'm strongly anti-foccacia. This bun looks like foccacia bread (cut square & about the same thickness) but it definitely wasn't. Soft & tasty, it was great sopping up the burger juices & dressing.  I also had the yukon gold fries which were good. While they don't jump to the top of my fry list, they're definitely respectable. MB has a few soft drink choices, a bunch of bottled water (sparkling & still) & I saw a bunch of bottles of wine so I'm guessing wines by the glass. (I was pretty much there for the sliders.)  The guys at the window were also quite cool & happy to do soda refills.  There were also some interesting looking ice cream sandwiches on the board.  While I thought everything was good, the major highlight for me was the sliders. I'd say they're even destination worthy. In addition to stopping over while in the mall, I will even fight the mall parking & crowds for more of those sliders.  It's in Fashion Square but is separate from the Modern Steak. Couldn't add the spot with the same address. Kept kicking it out.  Scottsdale Fashion Square 7014 E. Camelback Rd. Scottsdale AZ 85251 P: 480.423.7000"}
{"text":"Now that was a great burger!  Single..Cheese..Bacon..Grilled onion   Yum!"}
{"text":"They should call it Modern Bun because there is 6x more bun than burger.  Remember the commercial \"where's the beef?\"   This definitely applies here."}
{"text":"The BEST burger in the city.  Hands down.  No nonsense, no options, no choices.  Leave it the way it is because it is perfect."}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwich was the best sandwich ivr ever had. It was a warm fresh bun, egg, tomato, mayo and avocado"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everytime I stop in Phoenix I come here. The Breakfast burger with egg is my favorite. Excellent meat, fresh veggies & a soft brioche bun. Probably the best I've had in airport food."}
{"text":"KIDS MEAL WINNER  If you're a girl (or eat like one) save a few bucks and get the kids meal. The fries are normal size, so is the soda and I think the burger is too!  See my pic for size :)"}
{"text":"This was my first stop after my plane landed at PHX on Sunday afternoon.  After I managed to get lost about 20 times in the huge Scotsdale Fashion Center, I finally managed to find the little blue window for Modern Burger.  I picked up two sliders and a side of fries.  The have two small tables right next to the ordering window, so I was able to dig in right away.  I thought the burgers were really good, which is impressive since I don't really like American cheese.  My leftovers were still delicious the next day after being warmed up in my hotel microwave.  Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Typically cautious with airport food. Quick service and reasonably priced. A leap above typical airport fast food choices."}
{"text":"Could all these reviews be the same place we tried recently?  Yep, i just checked my boarding pass.  We arrived just as they were opening in the morning.  It got so ridiculous  that I started taking notes on the back of my boarding pass. Should've walked away when the apathetic and surly girl behind the counter called the guy in front of us up and when he placed his order, told him they weren't ready to take orders yet! And it went downhill from there.  We ordered at 0459 and got our breakfast sandwich at 0512.  We were the second customers in line, and watched as five customers following us got their food first.  The place was chaos, there was no tracking of orders customers were just given food, presumably what they ordered, but not according to any system, the girl at the counter kept her back to the customers and stared into the kitchen, she was surly and rude and should most definitely be fired from customer service.  Customers just looked at one another and shook their heads.  We warned one guy off, he thanked us and left.  I have never seen anything like it.  I was truly worried about food poisoning, if the kitchen was so poorly managed what would the cleanliness be like?    Whoever owns this place:  You need to get some training, management and oversight going on!  ASAP.  Your place was a total embarrassment on 11 March 2013."}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix and I yelped all the eats between Gates A20's and over to A1-10 - all places seem to hold a 3.5 star rating.  I really like burgers. Usually will try to find a good burger place whenever I travel. Modern burger had the same amount of stars but the prices were REALLY reasonable and we could get an egg on our burger. My husband was over me yelping all the restaurants so we went with modern burger with low expectations. I did like the design of this place (white brick wall, metal white industrial chairs)   The lady who helped us was really nice! Ordered a single patty ($5.50) and added an egg. ($1) She instinctively asked us if we were splitting (we were!) and said she'd cut it in half. How kind! Added an order of fries and asked for 2 water cups. She gave us 2 large cups of ice water.  The burger was cut in half and individually wrapped! also very thoughtful. Took a bite and immediately wished I got my own burger ;)   The burger was very good and tasty! It was really juicy with the thousand island and full with lettuce, tomatoes and the fried egg. I liked the bun but it was on the thin side, could have been a little better.   The fries were okay but the salt seasoning they added helped with the taste and made them smell delicious :)  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again. Really impressed with the service and quality of food - i never really leave a review after I go to a place but this place left an impression... plus I'm waiting to board my plane ;) thanks modern burger!"}
{"text":"I picked up a Modern Burger at the Phoenix Airport and ate it for lunch on my flight to Atlanta,    It sure beat the food for sale on the plane and was way better that the pre-made and more expensive sandwiches in Phoenix airport.    A pilot was in the line ahead of me.  His advice:  never buy the food on any plane and Modern Burger was the best, least expensive food in Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Went passing thru on a connection.  Underestimated this place. There gave me this juicy greasy diner style burger. Well seasond.  Would go back if I ever pass through again."}
{"text":"Well I have to give this place a 4 star review. Everything was on point. Even the price wasn't that bad for being in an airport. I got a cheeseburger with grilled onions fried egg and bacon and fries on a buttered bun. Yes, it was horribly good. Between shaking the grease off my fingers and shoving the seasoned fries into my mouth I was surprised I found time to swallow. This burger hit the spot. A nice big juicy patty, real egg and bacon and the thousand island dressing sauce out it over the top. Man oh man. Fries were crispy good and seasoned with johnnys seasoning salt I believe. Cashier was quick and efficient and the burger was out to me in about 5 minutes or so. Definitely be back if I ever fly through again."}
{"text":"Great burger - especially for an airport. I got it to go and ate it half way thru the flight and it was still very good."}
{"text":"Modern Burger serves up a dang good burger, with actual veggie toppings (including grilled onions!), for cheap.  You can add on a ton of additional toppings like eggs for additional dinero.  I had the plain old single burger ($5) and was impressed with both the seasoning and the size.  This is a way better alternative to the standard overpriced airport fast food chains (*cough*Seattle'sRunwayGrill*cough*).  I wasn't as impressed with the chocolate shake (too sugary/syrupy for my taste), but the hubbie enjoyed it.  Fries were plentiful and crisp.  Reasonably-priced airport food?!  What's up with this?"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome burger for the price. Got the double, it was juicy and cooked right. I'd visit if you're craving a burger in the airport."}
{"text":"Reliable if unremarkable burger and fries place. Would have made this a 4* review but for recent slowdown in speed of service. Usually a simple burger & fries order is done within 10 mins but tonight and last Sunday were over 15 mins."}
{"text":"Super cheap, super quick, and open late for late flights. Great airport joint, as are all the digs in this gate, but yum-mmie. I definitely got off a flight to catch a connection and the first thing I said was \"mmm it smells like backyard grilled burgers.\" Great welcoming olfactory surprise."}
{"text":"Honestly, did I eat at the same place as the other reviewers? My burger looked nothing like the one pictured.  It was kind of squished and the bun was damp with what I refer to as sweat and who wants sweaty buns? I looked at the meat since it wasn't sizzling hot and it was pink enough and looked cooked enough that it was safe to eat.  I didn't really taste the difference between this burger and one at McDonald's to be honest and I would hardly describe McDonald's burgers as amazing or heavenly.  Yes it was relatively quick.  It wasn't super expensive as airport restaurants tend to be but I would not describe it as cheap at all ($6 for a breakfast sandwich?).  It was pricey enough that I chose to fore go the fries and a drink.  There was no place to sit nearby and the only condiments were mustard and mayonnaise.  My initial excitement at a \"gourmet\" fast food place in the airport was quickly diminished once my order arrived.  Maybe late at night or with an fried egg for breakfast I could think more of Modern Burger.  But I likely will not try it again if I fly through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good but expensive.  Worth trying but not worth avoiding or seeking out in particular."}
{"text":"Modern Burger is weird. It's attached to an expensive steakhouse located in a ritzy mall, yet it's seems like it's trying to emulate an in-n-out burger type of experience albiet with slightly higher prices.   It's basically a little window you order from, and outside the order window is a couple of hightop counters with benches. It's set up perfectly for eating while people-watching...which let's be honest, is the best thing about going to Scottsdale Fashion Square.   It takes a few minutes on average, and you're presented with a couple of sliders. They aren't very big, but unless you've got a raging appetite, they should do the trick...especially if you get an order of fries with them. Each time we've went, the burgers have been cooked to perfection...they're really juicy and flavorful. Nothing fancy...just a straight up burger with all the regular toppings that'll melt in your mouth. There's something to be said about a nicely cooked burger. When you use fresh meat and cook it right...you don't need to get fancy and have exotic toppings. There's just something about these burgers that melts in your mouth...whatever it is...it's got me craving them every couple months if we happen to be at the mall.   I wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these burgers, but if you're already at the mall, you're not gonna do any better than Modern Burger for a nice little Mall lunch. It easily beats out all the other Mall food offerings. Worth a try. 3.75/5."}
{"text":"I really just wanted a burger in the airport during my layover after fighting not to spend ridiculous amounts of money on airport food. Modern Burger really hit the spot.  Not only is it made fresh, but it's full of great flavor! It was simple, didn't need fancy anything. I love that you can choose grilled v. raw onions. I opted for the grilled and man was I happy with that. They were chopped and caramelized to perfection. I think what got me the most was the bun. It was so soft and went really well with the hamburger meat. They truly blended together.  I'm down to get another burger from here, even if it is overpriced airport food"}
{"text":"One word describes these modern burgers: awesome. Ok, so they're not your typical burger, they are sliders, but this is as good as sliders get. Wonderfully crafted, melt-in-your-mouth good, right down from the juicy meat to the focaccia-like bun. I'm not a huge fan of many burger buns, and these are probably the best buns I've ever tasted! And I've tasted a lot of buns! I assure you, you will not be disappointed. I've been here twice so far. The second time I went here, my burger was not as hot and fresh as the first time I went, so I'm not sure if that was just a slow day for them or what. Still, it was an amazing burger. The Yukon fries are very tasty and have a nice \"crispness\" to them. They're definitely not your Mc D's fries. Two sliders will cost you about $6, fries another $2 or $3, and don't forget your drink. Take your pick: soda or wine. I think it's well worth the price for a Saturday afternoon party-in-your-mouth. Since this place is in the mall, and literally in a window in the mall, there's no waiters, no tables. It's best to enjoy while it 's hot, so just pick up your food in a paper bag and find a seat anywhere you can at Fashion Square. They do have a few fancy picnic-like tables in front of the window, but I've found that they are usually taken.  Dieters beware. Although, they do offer salads!"}
{"text":"Good food and airports are usually mutually exclusive. In this case the food is amazingly great, probably the best simple food a busy traveller has ever had. No frills here, just a beautifully prepared double cheeseburger with egg on top. The bun is fresh and soft and brioche like, the burger a perfect medium and it was so messy ( a good thing! ) that I needed a knife and fork. Please other airports realize that simple good food is possible. Hats off to this great burger joint!"}
{"text":"Feel like blowing your diet?! Come try what I like to call, the Modern Big Mac! The major differences is in the quality of the ingredients, such as the thousand island, onions (caramelized), buns (square), patty (jucier), and I suppose American cheese (meltier)!  I think the lettuce is about the same! The most obvious is that it comes in slider form factor, approximately 3-inches by 3-inches?  And it comes in a nice folded cardboard box.  1 order of the Modern Burger gets you 2 sliders (as mentioned) that comes out to 5 bucks and something cents.  The fries is a separate order which, at this time, came out super crispy and hot! 2 bucks and something cents.  Shareable.  Next time: Chopped Turkey Salad and Ice Cream Sandwiches...  To be continued..."}
{"text":"As we were sitting at the sleek white high bench table eating our yummy burgers, Glenn says to me \"I think this is the best burger in the Valley.\"  I contemplated that for a little bit and he asked me if I agreed.  Well, I couldn't really come up with anything better.  We love the burgers at FEZ, and we've tried the burgers at Delux, I mean really, we've kind of tried everywhere that says they have great burgers.  So yeah, I have to agree that Modern Burger makes the best burgers in the valley, even if they are only 3 and a half inches in diameter.  I ordered a pair of the sliders along with a side of fries for sharing.  At roughly 6 bucks for 2 sliders, I was expecting some pretty great things, and man oh man did Modern Burger deliver!  The meat was ultra tender, full of yummy juiciness and cooked to the most perfect burger temperature.  The cheese was perfectly gooey, but not messy, and the sauce was just right.  The buns that these babies were served on were also delicious, not just a mere vessel for holding meat.  The fries were also delicious, sprinkled lightly with a large chunky sea salt that made them nearly irresistible.    Do I sound slightly obsessive?  Probably.  This may actually be the one special place that can get a Scottsdale loathing couple to venture out there more often, even if it is just for a meal."}
{"text":"Second visit gets a one star bump from my first review. I now consider Modern Burger to be a destination for dining in the Phoenix airport.   Friendly service at the counter and quick delivery of good, reasonably priced (for an airport) food. This is not a meal to eat trying to balance on your lap at the gate though, a.k.a messy!  And the burger...?  As the foot f'in master once said, \"This IS a tasty burger!\""}
{"text":"For airport food, they make a decent burger.  Ordinarily I would give the burger itself three stars but again relative to your typical airport food this is a good choice."}
