{"text":"Their produce selection and quality beats Walmart by far.
Pretty good sales on a regular basis.

They manage to keep plain Greek yogurt in stock most of the time.

The store is always clean.

My only complaint which is typical of most stores is that they need to keep a couple more registers open.
For what they save with self checkout they can afford to hire a couple more people."}

Fine...that last one was stretching it.

I've been to this Meijer at 12am, 12pm, 4am, and 4pm over the course of my undergrad years and the consistency and excellence of the place, at whatever hour of the day, has been otherworldly.

This place is the definition of \"one stop shopping.\" Where else can you get everything you need for thanksgiving dinner, an arsenal of airsoft guns, and bedtime slippers? Only at Meijer. 

And if you have an answer that's not \"Meijer,\" take one of the many high quality cleaning chemicals stocked on Meijer's pristine shelves and chug as much of it as fast as you can. You can even use the beautiful china stocked in their household goods section. And then rest your lifeless (previously useless) body in their furniture section where your final thoughts will be how wrong you were about the excellence that is Meijer. If you can't find any of those things, Meijer's super helpful staff will assist you (ask for Rick P).

If I ever win a Super Bowl, I couldn't care less about Disney Land.

Meijer 4 lyfe!

[Yelp has no option to check for whether or not this place is \"Good for Kids.\" I'll take the time to tell  you that it is. It's also \"Good for Groups\" and \"Good for Life in General\" as well. If Meijer can't make you a better person, then you probably suck.]"}

{"text":"Well my migraine ended up lasting 45 days. And my doctors all agree its because even after a week of asking Carmen to stop filling medication I dont use and to fill my preventative migraine medication she didnt. During this week I pleaded with her to at least do an override or a preauthorized. She refused.  So, I ran out of it and could not take it. That is why I had to go through a 45 day migraine. It required multiple hospitalization and treatment at multiple medical facilities. 

I kept think surely this pharmacy will fill my medication that I take daily and have for seven years. That they have filled every month for seven years. The medicine I need and the only medicine that I have asked them to fill!
I thought wrong they are just very neglegent.

What worse is this pharmacy goofed up again!
This time some how they forgot to fill my husbands heart medication...
They said it was his fault.
They refused to allow me to even ask that they dont do this again.
Im his wife. I am allow to ask anyone i want to, that they do not attempt to murder my husband!!!
They are a really bad pharmacy. And evidently dont care.
Terrible.
Miejers Pharmacy!
Please try not to kill your patients.
Oh, and stop calling them customers. You are a pharmacy not a retail store. Aren't you?"}
{"text":"I pretty much try to make it out to Meijer every weekend to stock up on the usual: milk, yogurt, fruit, rice cakes, peanut butter, free snacks =P

Prices are cheap, they have basically anything you could need... think Jewel or Dominick's on steroids.  Not only do you have your groceries section, but they have clothing (which I would never buy), cosmetics, office supplies, home furnishings, a pharmacy... pretty much anything you could ever possibly need, and then some.

This place really is a one stop shop.  Love it!

My only complaint is that it's too far from campus!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to leave this review after experiencing yet another frustrating shopping experience with Meijer Curbside. Meijer's website is sluggish on a good day, the items are difficult to find, and the system lags interminably just waiting for the green box that shows that the item made it into the cart. I think the items can be found by department as you shop, but they don't end up in the cart that way, so it's hard to check my list when I think I'm finished. I'm always forgetting something. And although they offer substitutions, the emails that you get telling you what they've substituted often list completely unrelated items, and a lot of times it's completely inaccurate. It's really glitchy and untrustworthy. I feel like a beta tester for their shopping site rather than a valued customer.

I will say that the *people* who work at Meijer--particularly the folks who work Curbside--are awesome. They're very friendly and conversational, and when the system's running right, they make the whole experience very positive. But I think Meijer underestimated how much people would use the Curbside service, and I just don't think the system is keeping up. What I was hoping would be a time saver ends up costing me more time in the long run, with plenty of frustration to accompany it. I'm starting to wish they'd never introduced Curbside, because I was fine with my old shopping habits (I end up there probably once a week). The prices and selection are good, but with other stores tiptoeing into the curbside delivery market, I find myself looking for other options."}

The clothes are tacky, pet department is something you'd see on a 20/20 investigation, and the cashiers are wore-out overworked and rude.

This is the downfall of the grocery store."}
{"text":"My review is of Meijer as a grocery store. They offer \"one-stop-shopping,\" (think Super Wal-mart with better food), but I almost never buy anything but food there. 

A few big pluses for Meijer are: 
They are the only local store (that I know of) that offer Dean's dairy products. I've been making special trips out there for Dean's Over-the-Moon fat free milk that tastes like full-fat milk. (BTW, It's expensive). If you want Dean's milk or ice cream, come here first.
They are also the only store (again that I know of) to offer kosher foods (something my Jewish girlfriend appreciates). 
They have cheeper prices on a few products like eggs, which are usually less than 90 cents. 
They have a very large selection of great-looking fresh produce. 

A few drawbacks are: 
They are on North Prospect, the major shopping area of town; but also the most crowded area of town and the area with the worst traffic in town. Avoid Saturdays and Sundays unless you're going after 11pm. 
Check-out is horrific every hour of every day. About half the check-outs are self-check outs. A great idea in theory, but in reality a cost-cutting pain-in-the-***. If you're buying alcohol, or have a coupon you'll have to wait for someone to come certify your transaction. God help you have both coupons and alcohol! I once got screwed because I couldn't use a coupon after scanning a six-pack. Frustrated, I left and planned to return to the service desk. When I did I was told to go **** myself, I had to percent the coupon at time of purchase.
The check-outs are not bring-your-own-bag friendly. If you're an environmentally friendly shopper and bring your own re-usable bags, you'll find the check out a bit more awkward than other stores with different bagging set-ups (but not impossible).
There is no deli service counter. If you want fresh sliced deli meats and cheeses, go somewhere else. 
Sale items might be out of stock by mid-week. 

Given the great produce, the low-cost of some items, and the offer of Dean's products, I still visit Meijer on occasion, but it's not my first stop for groceries."}
{"text":"A very large establishment for all items for your daily needs: groceries, toiletries, home goods, electronics, etc. When we visit we take our student to stock up on food and such. This one stop shop is convenient. Although there are a lot of check out counters there never seem to be many open resulting in long lines."}
{"text":"Meijer, oh Meijer.

For you non-Midwest folks, Meijer is a local supermarket chain in Michigan, Illinois and other surrounding states.  Now, for you non-Dutch aware folk, Meijer is basically prnounced as \"Meyer.\"  The \"ij\" is a \"y\" sound in the sassy language of the Netherlands.

Meijer is a terrifyingly ginormous box store.  It's huge.  It's not just a grocery store, although it takes care of most of your grocery needs.  It also has electronics, entertainment, garden stuff, furniture, ninjas, and probably a small traveling circus in the back somewhere.  They even have organic stuff, although it's hard to be true to my California roots and shop organic when it's 3 x the absurdly low prices of the rest of the stuff.

Also, Meijer is fantastic at 2 am on a Saturday night (it's 24 hours).  You can frolic in the housewares and indulge in the late snacks or get some cheap ice cream.  

Meijer is horrendous on a Sunday afternoon, as stressed out families and zoned out college students buy their weight in products.  Here's a note: AVOID the self-check out lane, or rather, avoid it when a selfish ass middle-aged couple decides that they should buy $150 of items and then complain that they have to find a worker because they had seven special kinds of coupons---COME ON PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE SPECIAL SHIT, USE A REAL CHECK OUT.  I had 13 items.  And just wanted to go home.

I'm still gonna shop the gigantic store.  But grrrrrr, not on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of grocery shopping. However, when I do go shopping, Meijer is one of my regular stops. They have a great selection of foods, home goods, and really anything you could ever need. 

The store is huge, but the layout is really customer friendly. Since I try to keep my shopping as efficient as possible, I like that I can get in and out quickly. Another perk? They have a ton of self-checkout lanes. They have lanes for those who have a few items, as well as lanes for those who have done some serious shopping. 

I typically opt for self-checkout but the regular lanes are great as well. The cashiers are incredibly quick and friendly. Thanks Meijer, keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the produce at meijer, and the mperks have saved me quite a bit. I have been disappointed by the service at the deli on multiple occasions. It just has seemed as though they have been annoyed by me just picking up one or two items. It has made me start getting my deli items at other stores or avoiding meijer because of the poor service."}
{"text":"This is the worst store I have been to in recent memory.  My picture of the radishes in the produce department was indicative of the rest of the fresh produce.  The other item I did not take a picture of was the clamshell of \"living\" butter leaf lettuce.  However there was nothing living about it.  It was shrunken and rotting.  Needless to say, I passed on getting produce.  

The whole experience turned me off from wanting to shop there.  

What did I learn?  I would rather have shopped at the worst WalMart then to step back in their again."}
{"text":"For purely sentimental reasons, I'm a big fan of Meijer. It was the grocery store of my college days. Many an afternoon was spent perusing a massive Meijer near my college apartment and even though I was dirt poor at the time, I occasionally sprang for a corn dog from the deli. I scrimped and saved by buying groceries on the cheap and I even still have a tie that I once bought on super discount. 

So, whenever I'm back in the Midwest, I try to stop by a Meijer to relive the magic. Of course, it's just a grocery store and the magic of yesteryear has somewhat abandoned me, but they still put together a fine assortment of goods. The produce section, for example, is above average. Some of the other sections are hit or miss--you might find some great housewares and you'll probably find some that feel a little less dependable. 

Overall, though, I still think Meijer stacks up nicely to any other chain across the country. I'll happily choose them over most when given the chance."}
{"text":"Just called store to confirm and they DO NOT have delivery at this time.  Kind of a bummer for the college students living in apartments with no car."}
{"text":"Its my grocery store of choice at college, has just about everything I need. Now if only all my frozen food didn't thaw while waiting in the idiotically long checkout lines, I'd be set."}
{"text":"My goto grocery store for \"American\" groceries. This store is big. I can get most of the groceries I want here & they usually have really good deals/weekly discounts on the stuff I happen to want! They also have Goat milk, which a lot of stores don't have.

They have really nice beauty, bath, makeup, etc. sections as well. Popular drugstore makeup either gets sold out quick here or they don't restore often.

I only wish it could switch spots with Schnucks =("}
{"text":"I think this is a Midwestern-chain supermarket. They sell everything from furniture to food to clothing in a 24 hour shop. However, beware of the walruses. Everytime I come here, I end up leaving vowing never to eat sweets and junk food ever again. The junk food here is unbelievably cheap from $3.50 rotisserie chicken to $2.50 hagen daaz ice cream.  No wonder everyone that shops here fills up more than just one chair."}
{"text":"Stopped in today while traveling for a few things; produce was pretty low in the late afternoon.  I self checked out, so no idea how slow lines can be here.  The restrooms need some serious remodeling...."}
{"text":"Love when they have rambutan however when they have it, it is no longer that beautiful red color that it is when it's good and fresh, it's very dark almost a maroon brown, which means it's near rotting, however I'm able to get it fresh at another place in town  on certain days :). Good store, generally busy most of the time with a lot of college students, employee friendliness is 50/50 half are kind the other half seem like they don't want to be there. They do have a great selection of products, little bit of this and that :) if I can't find it at Walmart of schnucks I can here :)"}
{"text":"Great grocery store, large selection and very reasonable prices. They have a particularly good selection of produce. The gluten-free section is reasonable, but not extensive. I wish they had a bigger selection of gluten-free grains, such as flours, oatmeal, seeds, etc. Most of the people who work there are very friendly and helpful. They also have a good selection of plants, crafts, electronics and clothes. 

It can get uncomfortably crowded, particularly on weekends. I try to go during the week when it's not so busy. 

Complaints include the fact that sometimes produce is bought out too fast and they haven't restocked specific items fast enough. Also, many of the checkout lanes are never used, causing long lines at the ones that are. I could also do without the Walmart-style greeters. Yes, I know it gives someone a job but to me, it's just really annoying and feels so forced."}
{"text":"It's not Wal-Mart, and that is good enough for me. Aside from the obvious, they also have some decent kosher and ethnic options when one is in that neck of the woods (North Prospect). Decent produce is a plus, and if I am in need of toiletries, winter wear, summer wear, or anything that is required ASAP, I know I can count on Meijer."}
{"text":"The store is well stocked and tidy.  The grocery store offers a nice selection of fresh fruit and veggies.
The one thing that would make the shopping experience more productive if the staff would be more outgoing.   When you approach a staff member all the efforts go to assist you in solving your question or search.  I would like to have a staff member ask me if everything is ok.  When you are roaming the store the staff should make the first approach.   \"Can I help you?\"   Lots of time you are in the wrong aisle.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Meijer store.  I went in the store expecting a grocery store.  Found everything - clothing, garden, housewares, etc.  The prices were right as well.

We shopped the liquor department.  They had a sizable selection of wine and craft beers."}
{"text":"When I can't find what I need at Target which is closer to home, this is where I go. Always find what I need, great prices, and normally friendly service at checkout. They also have a great nail salon right inside the store (see my Angel Nails review!)."}
{"text":"I have conflicting feelings about Meijers.

So cheap!

So crowded!

Everything I need in one store!

But the cheese is so $!*&!# expensive!

Oh, my god, overwhelmingly crowded!

But the cookies in the bakery are so amazing!

I went on a Sunday afternoon.  I really should've read Teej's review before doing that, but alas, I did not.  I'd been there briefly sometime during a weekday to pick up comfort food (garlic bread and cookies) after a particularly traumatic afternoon of state employment testing and the DMV, and it hadn't been that bad.  But Sunday?  Oh, god.  Oh, not Sundays.  I swear that people were actually trying to aim their cart into mine.  Everyone ambled around slowly and aimlessly like zombies on barbiturates.  They would plod along at .001mph and then stop and stare for 5 minutes at the rack of tomatoes.  They wouldn't move when you tried to reach around them for the tomatoes you also needed.  Take this experience at the tomato stand and multiply it by every place you needed to stop and get something.  I wasn't one of the zombies, and my Sunday-Meijers experience took me over an hour to escape.

Also, I had the bad luck of happening to need things that were on sale, so they were out or almost out.  Like Prego and tofu.  And why didn't they have any bricks of Mozzarella?  That wasn't even on sale, it was just inexplicably absent.

But the cookies are so good."}
{"text":"A big-box all-in-one store much similar to a Super-Walmart, but with a reverse emphasis on grocery vs. everything else. Buses from the local UIUC campus stop by on the street. The lines here can be incredibly long. Unless you're here at the super-late, post-family line times after midnight.

The groceries here are sometimes cheaper than other locations, and certainly well-stocked with food you probably should eat less of (snacks and ice cream, noticeably), although partially to cater to the student population, I think.

Overall not bad, they generate business by being the one-stop for almost everything, but they'd probably be better off with speedier lines."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes at the bakery for service. Called the service desk to see if they could send someone over with no success. Spoke with the store director who informed me they did not have anyone working in the bakery but someone from the deli would be over. Still waiting. By the way they have a sign posted in the bakery that states \" Open to Serve you 6am-9pm\". It's only 6:30pm. Time to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Meijer based on the sheer number of products they carry. Wow. 

I stopped into Meijer on Prospect (my first visit ever to this location) to pickup a cake I had ordered. 

I eyeballed the bakery right when I walked in and had to stay laser focused on getting there..there were so many other tasty items to stop and look at that I was getting severely sidetracked. 

The employee who helped me in the bakery was very nice. My online order turned out great. 3/5 for the cake. Dummy me assumed the cakes were baked when ordered, but I think they do a lot of baking ahead of time and assemble + decorate as the specials orders come in. My cake didn't taste super fresh and it certainly wasn't moist. I can't expect much for only $12 and on the bright-side the cake was decorated exactly as I had ordered it. Yay! *note* you aren't required to prepay for a cake if you order it online.* I can't imagine that this practice is going to stay in place, as there are probably several cake orders that don't ever get picked-up. I assume they put the unclaimed special orders on a discount cart or give them to a pantry. 

Once I had the cake I moseyed around the deli area for a little bit. So many things to drool over. As previous reviews also mentioned, some of the items I picked up were very near their expiration dates. They were super stocked on items, but no way was all that stuff going to be sold before they expired. Can you imagine how much of that is going into a dumpster next week? 

I'd definitely come back. Meijer is more affordable than Target and more upscale than Walmart. It's a one-stop-shop for all things home related. 

Ample parking. Clean store. Huge variety."}
{"text":"This store seems to have more variety than the Urbana store.  As with all Meijer stores, the layout makes no sense, but this one is a little better than the Urbana store.  I can always find all my groceries here so it makes for great one-stop shopping.

The produce is usually pretty decent and their meat is better than Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"The pros are that you can find pretty much anything here and M-Perks are useful to help save a slight amount money, although make sure to check you are actually being rewarded the deals, because that isn't always the case. 

Unfortunately, there are major shortcomings. Meijer's produce is really frustrating, as it's often either universally unripe, spoiled, or unavailable. There is virtually no one available in the aisles to direct you anywhere, even though it's a huge store. The worst part is that you need to diligently check the expiration dates on everything you buy, because there are tons of expired products spread out all over the store. I once found a section of two dozen yogurt containers that were almost 2 months expired. That is not acceptable. 

I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars because it's still a useful store and there are ways to work around its deficiencies, but be aware of these issues."}
{"text":"This has become the regular grocery store for my husband & I. They have a great grocery department and the prices are reasonable. The greeting card section is also well stocked. We buy a lot of funny cards and at Meijer these are easily found. I only wish that they had a larger home & office section. They only have a few rows of stationary supplies and not much selection. It would be nice to get everything at one store but sometimes it doesn't work out. If you're into coupons, you'll want to combine your Meijer perks with your coupons. We probably save around $10/trip using both of those. It's so worth the time put i"}
{"text":"I could just write \"Kamut 'n Honey\" here, and satisfy myself. But that wouldn't satisfy my readers, so I will expand that.

Meijer is more than a grocery store, more than a department store, more than a toy store - it's a crazy gestalt of weirdness. I had a lot of fun coming here at odd hours of the night and getting things such as a frozen pizza and a copy of Bust a Move for the SNES. Or, one night during finals freshman year, brauschweiger, spackle, and a putty knife. Seriously, where else can you do that at 2AM?

Now to explain my cryptic first comment. We found this strange cereal \"Kamut 'n Honey\" there. It had a big spiel about kamut being the most ancient of grains on the back, and a big Egyptian pharaoh head thing n the front. Crazy stuff. And also a bit scary. I actually ran an experiment one year, where I secretly marked the boxes in the store. Every time I went back, these exact same boxes were there. As far as I know, no one has every bought this cereal (and that's why I believe it no longer exists). The sad thing is, it might have been the greatest cereal ever, but I was too busy laughing at the absurdness of it to ever try it. And now I will never know."}

This store beats you all in pricing, products, and general aestetics! Plus, they even have a nail place inside if I wanted a pedicure (which I didn't today).

{"text":"My first experience with the \"buy everything including groceries here\" concept, used to be the only game in town until Super Walmart opened up.  Very useful for the college student in that it is open 24 hours.  There are some up in Chicago in the suburbs I have seen, but they also have to compete with Super Targets as well.  For groceries, I always prefered Schnuck's in Urbana (for selection and service), but they always had very good prices in the Meijer."}
{"text":"Their weekly adds are so small that you can't read them. When you magnify them they go to their biggest and you can't put the item you want to look at anywhere to see it. I have to take out a magnifying glass and even then I can't read most of the listing. 
A great grocery store, but their clothing is over-priced cheap stuff, the school and office supplies tiny, and in general it's too difficult to find quality except in groceries. Well, the fruit is all rocks, but some vegetables are good and the meat is. Canned goods and such compete well with places like WalMart."}
{"text":"My experience is that the produce here goes bad in a few days.  And.. they aren't really cheaper.  They claim they are.. and have items on sale for like 19 cents less than the original price.  That's not a sale!

I also think they have sold out a bit... they have a Starbucks inside.  Ugh.

I do go sometime.. but it's only when I don't feel like driving across town and Walmart doesn't have what I am looking for.

On the upside, they do have lots of boxes you can take if you go visit at night.  Very useful if you're moving.  :)"}
{"text":"Why do I come here? They NEVER have any lanes open. Their clerks are so SLOW it's insane.  You'd think that from 5-6 pm when people stop After work they'd have more than 3 people checking!!  On this particular day there were two people in front of me with average amount of stuff and it took 30 minutes to get through the line!  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Gotta disagree with the granny-panty reviewer.

The point of Meijer is one-stop shopping that doesn't break your wallet.

A little pricier than Wal-Mart but worth it: 24 hour shopping, organic options, dietary options for gluten allergies etc., tasty deli sandwiches, and all the cheap stuff to boot.

Most ppl in this college town, especially students, don't have the time, car or gas money to run to IGA, the Co Op, and independent businesses to get their supplies for the week. Bonus: ridiculously good Meijer brand cottage cheese.

So can I get an AMEN for this truly awesome church of consumerism where midnight shopping becomes an entertaining and affordable outing (Meijer carpools are part of the Champaign experience)?!!

By the way, if granny panties put you off don't stare at them, stare at the racks of decent and decently priced wine. And the clothes aren't terribly tacky, some of us can't afford head to toe Abercrombie, you know."}

The service was good and friendly and the place seemed much cleaner than any walmart I've ever been to."}
{"text":"There are 3 types of people in this world. And, it's never to early to start someone out right. 

So, Kridz is making dinner for her family tonight, so she needed things, like chicken, and spinach, and walnuts, and cranberries, and salad dressing, and gorgonzola, and bacon, and dry salad dressing, and a tube of the bread stuff from Pillsbury. I on the other hand, needed diet mountain dew. While walking around the store, I also discovered that I NEED habanero string cheese (such a mythical creature exists and stories of it have been told of old), and chicken nuggets, and chicken tenders. Did you know if you rearrange the sounds in ha-ban-er-o, you can get burn-yer-a-ho. 

Whilst walking around the vast grocery selection and running into Marv, and the colonel, I saw a mother raising her child right. 

Sometimes, the message gets diluted, sometimes it's clear as day, sometimes the method of delivery is the thing that's going to cause rebellion in the future. This was probably going to be the latter, except it won't kick in until she's a teen and she's going to need lots of therapy to discover exactly why she likes what she does.

{"text":"Like Wal-Mart, but higher quality meat, floral, organic, and produce sections. Prices are a few pennies higher on all items, but it's worth it to patronize a smaller Midwest chain than ubiquitous Wal-Mart. Workers are slow and not helpful, and they regularly only have 5-6 checkouts open during weekday hours, so I have waited up to 30 minutes in line at noon any day of the week. Suggest avoiding weekends altogether, though, because even with 20+ lanes open, you will never have a line shorter than 5 people. Nonetheless, they have everything under the sun including items that I cannot find anywhere else like Illini window stickers for $2, and as long as you buy 12 or fewer items, you can always by-pass the slow service through the self-checkout lanes. Clean, big, good store in which to pass at least an hour. Favorite generic items: Ultimate Oatmeal Cookies (in the front, fresh bakery section) and BBQ kettle chips. Everything else is universal to all big-chain stores.

Update: January 2008
Meijer has been running out of stock on all its sales by Thursday of any given week, and even staples like cottage cheese and pecan pie are sold out (off-sale) all week long. I find myself going here to pick up 4 items and having 3 be out of stock while the price of the 4th has risen. Plus, the service has gotten even slower, if anyone imagined that possible. More lanes are open than before (on any day) but it still takes 30 minutes to get through one line! Every Saturday they do some in-store program for kids or the community which only makes it more insane. You're lucky to find a cart and leave with your life on the weekends.

Originally, I gave the store 4 stars for variety and being a Wal-Mart competitor, but it's gotten pretty ridiculous to shop."}

Although Champaign is not a food oasis, I am realizing very quickly that your produce options are very limited compared to near the chicago-land area with the tony's finer food and marianos. A lot of the other stores are quite expensive including the local county market. Meijer on the plus side is a corporate chain which offers you national savings from the weekly ad. The food is cheaper than most locations because they buy in bulk. I recently hosted a party and got all my produce from meijer at the last minute. Staff is friendly and the store is massive with large inventory. 

Pros: good discounts, large selection

Cons: only one location

Hidden deals:

{"text":"Meijer is what Wal-mart would be if it wasn't run by corporate whores.

They have a ton of selections and great prices with a very helpful staff.  The lunch meat counter was really cheap com paired to the other places I've been to.  on;y complaint there is that the lady slicing the meat really was in no hurry to help anyone. it took 20 minutes to get a pound of sliced ham.

I mainly went for groceries when I am in Champaign since the only grocery store in Monticello is County Market and it leaves me needing things every time I got there."}
