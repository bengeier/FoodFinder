{"text":"This is a great bar.  Likely one of the best in Whitby.  Great atmosphere at almost anytime and the food menu is pretty good as well.  Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"First timer.  Went for post 10th anniversary dinner drinks and dancing - it didn't disappoint. Friday night Patio to dance floor was enjoyable.  Closed the place.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Love the tap! The food is fresh, served quickly and tastes unreal. They have a great selection of beers and wine, something that is a bonus when going with a big group of friends. It really is a Whitby institution so you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Went is for dinner , bar table service was extremely slow.  I don't think it was that busy and this place used to be better. Food was good though that a plus."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout on friday or saturday night if you're looking for live cover bands and a crowded bar. Lots of friendly servers... not sure if it's because they are just too busy or if i had too many drinks but i have been overcharged for drinks several times..."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Whitby! We go there at least once a week. Excellent options for vegetarians (I am obsessed with the cauliflower couscous tacos and the cheese stuffed pretzels!) There's usually a deal on pints which is also nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tap & Tankard and I was very impressed with the facility, service,food and beer selection. It is a very clean restaurant with new fixtures and well maintained tables and chairs. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were given the option of inside or patio. There are lots of tv's and a variety of sports to watch - always good. Our server was gracious and friendly. We ordered onion rings, poutine and a grilled cheese sandwich. There was so much food we took some home. The food was delicious. Fresh ingredients and nothing was frozen. I was very impressed. The craft beer selection was awesome - lots to choose from and the staff was knowledgable about the beers-always good. I am definitely putting this place on my list of regular haunts."}
{"text":"It's a Whitby icon!

Booze and music .. That's what the tap has been known for since 1997 and if you go on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night... You will no doubt see what this place is all about!"}
{"text":"Good pub if your into the party scene.
Loud and crowded but good place to go with friends on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Wandering down Brock, and starving, we pub crawled our way down the street. 
We'd dined at KB, which was so awesome. My blue rare venison, bone in ribeye was perfection. But we just wanted a few beers and some pub grub. 

After a flat beer at Social Resto Lounge (when I say wandered I mean up and down Brock like zombies) we walked to the Vault. Seeing some hoity-toity's outside smoking and discussing the status of their stocks we walked past them with our noses in the air. (We never talk about our stocks outside the yacht club!) 
So past the suits and sidewalk construction to the Tap and Tankard. 

It looked small, yet inviting on the outside, but inside it was a mile long. (Could someone have slipped me acid already?). It really was deceiving from the outside. A good looking pub that gives you a warm feeling when you walk in.
My hot wings were a good size, crispy and juicy. And the blue cheese was like it should be, Chunks of cheese. Do you here me other pubs? Chunks, and thick, stick to your ribs (or wings rather) blue cheese dip.
And also my wife's Friday special, fish and chips, was quite good.
The beer and service also A+."}
{"text":"I had the tap spice wings and sweet potato frites and I was not disappointed!  Food was delicious!  We stayed outside on the patio, the weather was great and it was just a good atmosphere. It was lunch time and it wasn't too busy so the server did well. Would definitely go here again to try the other wing flavours."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the middle of the afternoon, so it was pretty quiet 
I had Cajun wings with a side of roasted Brussels Sprouts,  living a low carb lifestyle often means that a side dish means salad so I was super happy to see Brussels Sprouts which were SO delicious"}
{"text":"When we first entered, the place looked a little suspect for what we were wanting. The set up was much more bar oriented than eatery but the service was very good and the food delicious."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss. Ordered the pizza was meaty and a bit salty but edible. My partner ordered the pulled pork poutine. The fries were burnt and very dry and the waitress was not very accommodating and proceeded telling her about the hand cut fries experience without offering to give her a new batch.  The pulled pork on own was decent. Typical pub atmosphere, could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Better than most pub food. Not quite Gastro. Good local microbrew beers and changing taps. Lots of changing not events. Local musicians. Popular place for locals. 
Beers on day. Examples. Beaus. Flying monkey. Goose island. Muskoka. Side launch. 5 Paddles. They will so flights. 
That's all the good. 

The 3 -3. 1/2 stars. Understaffed. So waited quite a bit. Beer glass should not go empty. Food is ok. But not 5 stars. But I will prefice I did salads and guacamole. Burgers could be amazing. 

For the area. Worth a visit if you want micro brews."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place. The wife and i finally got around to trying it. The decor is a bit interesting half pub half club. There was a live band getting ready for a show and two other musics going on so that was a bit weird as well. 

We ordered water to start which came fine but it went downhill from there. My wife and i ordered Calamari to start and then we each ordered fish and chips, mine was the haddock rolled in Ms Vickie's and my wife's halibut plain. 

The food came out but we did not receive the Calamari, the server admitted to not ringing it in. Then the haddock was a huge piece and the halibut two small pieces. I assumed they had made a mistake as haddock is normally small. The server said yes it looked wrong and went to the kitchen yo get new ones made. Then cane out said it was being made, then came back out and said the original was right. By this time it was cold so we asked for it to be made again. In the end the fish was ok but the fries were really really good. 

I will try it again but this was for sure a poor showing."}
{"text":"You'd be hard pressed to find better wings anywhere! They are plump, super meaty, and they come out piping hot and fresh. The sauces truly have something for everyone. The Montreal Smoked are our absolute fav!! A must-try... Slightly sweet, smokey and caramelized. Mango Habanero... another treat if you like it extra hot! Those are our two favorite sauces. Pineapple curry... also unique and flavorful.
And Tuesday is wing night! 
100% awesomeness!

The waitresses are suuper nice! We go here quite often and the girls are always friendly and the service is top notch."}
