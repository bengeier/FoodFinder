{"text":"Went there last night. I had mixed feeling about going because of all the negative recent reviews. I had no problem walking in at 7 PM and getting a table. My friend told me after that 15 years ago, the lineups started around the block. I don't know what happened (whether they changed owners or just chefs) but it was mediocre food at best. A lot changes in 15 years and there are so many new and better restaurants for the same price (i.e. Jardin des puits on Villeneuve) Calamari starter was bland. I have no problem with frozen calamari but the texture was rubbery and the \"sauce\" on the table was just not good. I had the chicken brochette plate. The fries were decent although a bit greasy, The chicken was charred and super dry and the rice wasn't anything special. Such a shame. I had high expectations but the wait staff were friendly."}
{"text":"The best calamari in Montreal.  Also the rack of lamb is good to. The fries are huge. Love this restaurant. I am a regular customers since 1991. Each time I go I have quick service"}
{"text":"Best lamb in town. Great fast service."}
{"text":"le plat de calamar est, personellement vraiment bon. C'est la principale raison pour laquelle je fréquente ce restaurant depuis plusieurs années et je be suis jamais déçue!!"}
{"text":"Best fried calamari in Mtl!!! That's it, That's all.  The place is always packed. cash only, cheap, large portions and quick service.  Not my favorite gyro because the tzatziki sauce was too tangy and not salty enough for me, but that's personal preference.   It is one of the best deals in town.  Now take it and go..."}
{"text":"A neighborhood Greek restaurant, close to Jarry park,  with very casual decor. The one outstanding dish there is their fried calamari. It is, by miles, the best in the city. Well worth the detour if you are a fried calamari fan.  They fry up gigantic quantities of it daily.  Whether you get it to take out or eat it in the calamari is always melt in your mouth tender and the batter is crisp, flavorful and not too oily.  Unless you have a large appetite or you want to share it with someone, I suggest you take the entree and not the main course of calamari.  The portions are huge and the price is fair.  The rest of their offerings, mostly souvlaki and steaks, are ok.  Their large fries are very good.  None of it worth the detour to this more remote part of the city.  Be warned that this place is always bustling and there is most often an uncomfortable and long wait in a very tight spot or even outside at lunch and dinner. Which is why many folks call ahead for take-out.  It was featured a couple of years back on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."}
{"text":"The best place to get Calimari.  The portions are huge and the price is low.   The ambience is not the greatest, but the quality of the food makes up for it.    Due to the limited space, sometimes my friends and I would have to share a table with other people.  This is common for the restaurant.  After a while, it has a good communal feel. I will definitely being going back here."}
{"text":"Très très overrated.  We live in the greek district, (parc-ex) in Montreal, and we have tasted way way way better greek food.   In a nutshell: -Food was greasy, no subtleties, no authenticity whatsoever.  -Meat in pitas was literally soaked in yogourt and garlic mayonnaise.  -Tasted like greek junk food (what you can eat in food courts and food chains) -The supposedly excellent calamaris were too greasy and tasted like they had been soaked in salty water for a long time. Did not taste fresh, at all. We ate way better calamaris at Tripolis, for example, or in other mediterranean restaurants.  -Atmosphere was stuffy. -Greek salad and olives were mediocre  If you want to eat generous-portionned greek platters yet feel you've experienced an interesting culinary adventure, go to Tripolis (in the same neighbourhood). Price are similar and the food is much better."}
{"text":"huge portions friendly staff oddly an american feel...  the food was pretty good, i think the portions made them seem a bit tastier, tbh and the calamari was killer as expected no really it was amazing"}
{"text":"A decent Greek restaurant, we order lamb rib, pita and calamari. Nothing really stands out."}
{"text":"Great calamari & lamb chops!Chicken sticks are very good. Overall pretty good value. Huge line ups at dinner time and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Les calmars  fondent dans la bouche excellente je recommande Aussi le steak d'entrecôte mais on ne peut apporté notre vin"}
{"text":"Nice Greek tavern but nothing extraordinary. We took calamari for a starter just half size because full is very big - more like a main dish. They are really good, fresh and crispy. But Greek salad is a mistake. There should be no lettuce in original Greek salad and more kalamata olives. In ours I found just 2 olives! And cheese wasn't original feta. Chicken souvlaki was just fine. Lamb chops - very good. Probably the best thing you can get there. But please... Lettuce in Greek salad? Only 3 stars from me :("}
{"text":"Marven's is my pocket list when oversea friend come to visit Montreal.  I love the calamari, I love the lamp chop.  I love it."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant. Best Greek restaurant in this Greek neighbourhood a must for anyone. Worth a visit"}
{"text":"It's strange but I have a memory of my dad bringing me here to eat when I was a just a kid. I came back in my college years. And now I stopped in when the name flashed to me.  My timing might be off but if I had to guess I'd say it's been 30+ years that I first ate here.  The decor has changed but not the quality. And the sauce.. The sauce.  Anyone that wants a real tasty Greek meal should stop by."}
{"text":"I've been going to Marven's for 30 years. It was one of the places in the city that I could take out of towners and have them rave about it. That has changed. The last couple of times were not good. You can tell right away that the meat had changed. Every cube on the stick was the same size which leads me to believe that they have subbed out the meat process, which they used to do in the kitchen. My suspicions were confirmed when I bit into it. It tasted very bland. I'm sad to say that I won't be going back. Too bad. I used to love it."}
{"text":"If you like calamari, go to Marven's. Price-quality ratio in this restaurant is good!"}
{"text":"During my trip to Montreal, my friends and I ate dinner here. The place was packed but they were able to seat our group of 8 quickly. If someone said we were eating at Marven's, I would've assume it was an American restaurant, not a Greek restaurant. It literally looks like they bought the place from a steakhouse and they didn't have time to redecorate the Canadian place. There were moose heads on the wall and a picture of Justin Trudeau.   We ordered lamb chops, calamari, tzatziki, and spanikopitas. Greek salads came and so did the bottomeless bread. Spanikopitas get a 3/5, not crispy enough for me. Tzatziki was lovely (so 5/5 cause how can you mess it up). Calamari was delicious and deserves a 5/5 since it really hit the spot for dinner on a cold December night. As for the lamb chops, it was good but it was odd. It didn't taste like lamb to me. Not sure why and for that they get a 4/5.   Marven's gets a 4/5 because of their large portions, yummy food, and bottomeless bread. It would be nice to get quicker service since the waitresses and waiters seems so busy. They were kind when you got their attention but it was hard to call them over. The portions are huge so think about sharing a plate."}
{"text":"You come here for their lamb chops and calamari or you don't. The lamb chops were cooked exactly as per my liking and they have a really nice house sauce to go with it. I was on the verge of stealing their sauce.  Word of advice have the calamari while its hot, they tend to get a bit chewy and soggy if you let them sit."}
{"text":"This is a perfect dive restaurant the plates are very large portions of fantastic Greek food,try to go off dinner or lunch hours cause it fills fast very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Marven's is a pretty old school traditional place, a family sort of restaurant. They don't take reservations and there is usually a line out the door. The portions are enormous and food is very consistent and reliable. And I guarantee that you have never seen a bigger portion of calamari in your life. Note that the calamari does not automatically come with tzatziki so you need to order this separately.   Overall Marven's is a pretty solid place, however it is not particularly inexpensive and the line ups are long and I'm convinced that it is really worth all this. However, they do do takeout which is a good option if you need to get your calamari fix."}
{"text":"I've tried it few times and always come to the same conclusion: not that good. It feels like a Greek fast food. The sticks are fine, I haven't tried the calamari. Plus, sometimes it smells so you stink when you come out. I think people like it because of the portions they get for the money but when you've tried most of the Greek restaurants in town, you know this one is not part of the better ones."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with some friends and my family; wife and kids. It is a bit crowded to sit comfortably with kids but we did fit well.  The menu is diverse and you have some nice options. We have ordered the fried Calamari and it was really fresh and tasty. As for the other dishes, they were good but not amazing. The food generally is good and this is why I am giving this place a 3 star.  The service is nice and they were good, not a big smile but they were good. Be ware that they do not accept cards and only cash, so be prepared, unless you want to pay extra bank fees to use their ATM machine.   You try it and you be the judge."}
{"text":"Probably the best greek restaurant in town. Huge portion so share it or bring back home (they expect it too). The service can be a little more friendly but with all the customer they have, they're probably too busy running from table to table."}
{"text":"It's situated in a rather residential neighborhood and since I went for dinner, it was super quite and a little creepy too. The staff were nice and friendly but the food itself was rather 'meh'. I tried the lamb chops which weren't extraordinary or anything. Your regular lamb chop that's all. Also tried chicken brochette which was burnt black and tasted bitter. Their steak lacked flavor and their fries seriously needs more salt. However, I really liked their fried calamari and the sauce they gave with it. The calamari was fresh and crisp. I wouldn't come here twice though."}
{"text":"This place!  By far my favourite steak joint in Montreal!  I think it is 23 dollars and you get a bone in rib steak the size of your head!  No I'm not exaggerating sometimes it hangs off their large rectangular plate!  It also comes with a great Greek salad with a chunk of feta about 100-200 grams, rice and fries.  I have NEVER left without leftovers!  Otherwise the decor is not my usual cup of tea but I love it!  So weird sh!t on the wall like caribou heads and other stuff.  I'm not really sure what the heck its supposed to be but it works well.    This little carpeted joint that has been around for about 30 years is also located in a neighbourhood in a house :s reminds me of private restaurants in Hong Kong or Vancouver which is what I love most.   All in all if you have a chance you MUST come here!  Great service, below average prices, triple A quality, and bigger portions than one could ever consume alone!   If you like ambience for a first date or something go somewhere else lol unless this girl lives in a cabin up north then she will be right at home ;)"}
{"text":"Marvens is a Greek restaurant. Service is really good and so is the food. But the only problem is the tzatziki. You must order some on the side because they serve very little in the souvlakie pita's."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best tzatziki I have ever had. Great prices lead to long line ups. In the middle Of a residential hood. I didn't quite get the \"universal sauce\"."}
{"text":"The food is good, portions are enormous. Staff is friendly, you're getting served pretty fast in spite of rush hour (Friday 18:00).  Minuses: place is quite small and crowded, so, it's more \"eat-and-go\" place than \"spend-an-evening\".  Also, place is cash only, but there's and ATM.  I'd say it's more 4 than 3 Stars. And their calamari are GOOD. Very good."}
{"text":"Visit Marvens often, really like their lamb chop n Frits calamaris , love this place. But the price seems updated a lot been this years ! Lol"}
{"text":"If there is one thing I need to say is ORDER THE CALAMARI!  They are the best you'll ever have, tender, crispy, just wonderful! Once you get through those, have the awesome pita's filled to the brim, and the tzatziki Oh soooo good. The communal tables are a little outdated but who cares the food is so totally worth it."}
{"text":"Large portions, the calamari and rib eye were delicious! The lamb chops are to die for! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner at Marven's! Located in a residential part of Montreal, it's got an amazing old school vibe when you walk in.   If your from out of town and driving, pay attention as you may miss it. Also, leave time for Parking as it's difficult to find.   Get here early as it filled up fast when we got here Friday night for dinner. We ordered the souvlaki platter, which came with some of the most tender, flavourful chicken I've ever had, great portion of rice and salad (they were ok) and some of the biggest fries I've ever been served.   The Tzaziki here is better than my Moms, but I caution you, don't try it if you hate garlic because it's swimming in it. Being Greek, I didn't mind one bit. Your mouth will burn a bit!   We finished it off with their strawberry cheesecake. I didn't mind it, but it had a lighter texture, so don't expect that New York style with heavy cream cheese.   Great menu choices. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant when I have a calamari or lamb craving! I wouldn't say that it is the best restaurant for these, but their prices are competitive and the plates are huge! I can easily have leftovers for another meal when I eat there. One down side is that they don't take reservation and the restaurant is always crowded! So if you wanna avoid waiting in line, gotta go there early. They use to take cash only, but now they also accept credit card, woohoo!  If you go there, must try their calamari and lamb chops!"}
{"text":"Since I got here at the age of 3, Marven's has been a staple of food in my house. Their fried Calamari has few competitors. I usually get a 2 stick chicken souvlaki combo with their rice, though their fries are awesome too, with Caesar salad and bread for 15 tips included. Portions are pretty good. When I sit in, I'll have either steak or lamb chops. Service is good and bad depending how busy they get, which they do since people usually line up around lunch or supper. Still a good place to eat. Get the Calamari if you sit in, it's great."}
{"text":"This is my favourite steak restaurant in town, the steak was perfect, juicy and tasty, I will never forget the first bite, it was incredible delicious and the decoration there is just perfect for us. Home style decoration and cozy. With the grilled mushroom add to the steak will just give more flavour to it. The service is always good, before they add mushroom for free but now they will charge extra which is not a big deal. My boyfriend loves the fried calamari combined with beer, he can stay 2 hours enjoying the food and the environment. We go to this place minimum 3 times per months. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I recommend getting the calamari! So fresh and yummy with the lemon and Marven sauce. The gyros was good as well. Not greasy or fatty.  My entire family got the rib steak (huge for being only like 20$) and it's packed with flavor, HOWEVER it's fatty.  Overall, it's delicious! Recommended. :)"}
{"text":"If you love Grilled Octopus or a nice steak, you found your new place for it, besides been so well know for their deep fry calamaris and lamb chops. If you like desert you shall try their Cheese cake that they make themselves instead of few restaurants that get their deserts from bakeries... My preferred Grilled Octopus in town"}
{"text":"Go Greek! Good fried calamari, fresh salad, prime ribs, and gyros.  Very good meal overall. They are always busy.  I come for the salad, calamari, and fries.  That is the main dish everyone eats..just look around lol."}
{"text":"Been eating here for almost 30 years. Food hasn't changed, everything on the menu is amazing! Especially the quail, salads, rice, gyros and calamari! The plates are huge for the little price that you play for. Good food for a cheap price. If you want a show, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Good, busy restaurant. The fried calimari is delicious but since I'm not a big Greek food fan, I'm giving it 3 stars. I would say it's one of the better Greek places though. The portions are huge. Beware!"}
{"text":"We were two hungry guys and a friend had told us to come to Marven's for the best chicken Gyros in the city. The place has a homey neighborhood ambience and seems to be quite popular. To be honest, I wouldn't go back. Not only were they out of chicken gyro at 6pm on a Wednesday night, the service was atrocious. We tried to make small talk with our waitress and she was all business, basically throwing down plates of food at us. Every time we asked her for something, it was obvious that we were bothering her, she was very rushed and incredibly rude to us.   As far as the food goes, the bread is terrible. Tastes like an old loaf picked up behind a supermarket on which they've sprinkled some dry oregano. The Spanakopita were pitifully small (two for 4.00) , burnt, and not even homemade (i recognized they were the KRINOS spanakopita triangles immediately). The main dishes were a little better, but at 14.00 for a chicken pita with some fries, limp, flavourless salad and undercooked rice, it's not a steal.   The worst part of the evening was when we asked to have our bill and the waitress told us they were \"cash only\". There are no signs indicating this anywhere in the restaurant, nor is it written on the menu. Since there aren't many banks within close walking distance, you're forced to use the \"blue-chip\" ATM downstairs (where the owner takes a nice $2.50 fee in addition to what your bank will charge you).   Considering that this is Montreal, it's very surprising how long this restaurant has lasted. Their gyros and calmari (which we didn't order) must be out of this world in order to keep such a sub-par establishment in business."}
{"text":"Decent place for Greek fast food. The prices are fair and the portions are HUGE but the food itself is not exceedingly flavourful or unique. They are known for their calamari which I have to admit is pretty good especially with their Marven's sauce. The calamari has changed over the years but it is still one of my faves. This restaurant is quite popular so expect a small lineup and a packed dining room. Seating is a little cramped and the interior is begging to be upgraded (moose head and everything) but I guess that's part of the charm. I keep coming here once in a while when I'm in the area just to get my fix but there are definitely other better Greek restaurants out there."}
{"text":"It used to be better back in the days.  I'm more of a quality over quantity of a person, and even before, it used to be more generous than now, and it also used to be yummier.  Fried Calamari plate is over oily, soggy, non-crunchy anymore, and it's smaller. Again, I don't care about size because I have a small stomach anyway.  The rice is a bit rough and hard to chew on when I ordered a gyro plate.   Although, the meat is still good. Lamb chops are still excellent, the gyro I had was fantastic.  So there are ups and downs, but it's still a good place to eat.  Don't let 3 stars fool you, Marven's is still a great spot."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I like this restaurant and that I will return. So if the owner or staff see this.... please be nice to my food when I go back.  I wanted to order one of the 7 white wines on the menu. The waiter says we only have 1 of those 7. OK great start. Red wine was also in short supply. I order a platter with fries, salad and rice. The rice doesn't show up. I ask about the rice... \"We ran our of rice\" on a Friday at 7pm! Really.... OK. \"I'll bring you rice on a side plate when it's ready\" That was 4 hours ago, I'm still waiting for that rice. I once ordered a Greek salad that was anything but Greek. There was more lettuce than you would find in a Caesar.  I can proudly say that what did arrive at my table was great. Service was nice. But would it kill them to get tables for 2? There's aren't any! I had to share a table with some old people. And it's ok to renovate a restaurant every 20-30 years.   3 stars is harsh. I would have preferred to be able to put 3.5."}
{"text":"Greek food that's authentic, appetizing and tastes as good as it looks. The bread which is given to start with could use a little more effort, but that's okay if you're good with adding some of Marven's sauce which is a sour/savoury blended mildly hot sauce. The Greek salad is above average, which comes with most dishes. The lamb chops here are phenomenal and my favourite is the whole chicken platter which just tastes fantastic and is good for 2 hungry people. The calamari is one of my favourite Greek style ones. They only take cash, and I always forget to bring cash, but there is an ATM at the location."}
{"text":"I didn't receive the services I expect. They don't ask my choice of salad and they gave me mayonnaise ten minutes later I ordered after I almost finish half of the dishes. They don't ask how the food is like or say any words like bon appetite, but they ask for 15% tips at the end for their bad services. Second time went there, it used to be better service before. I'm probably not going there ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place more than I'm willing to admit. I believe they have been around before JC. Do not let the little house fool you, it's one of the best Greek cuisine you'll ever have. The lineups can be ridiculous because they do not accept reservations so try to go at a random time. They offer takeout but I'm not patient enough to carry that food all the way back home. The waiters are the most effective and helpful you'll ever meet. They are known for their calamaris and steaks. I usually share calamaris as an appetizer then I have a gyro pita, some salad and the fries. Sometimes I end it with the cheesecake (they don't always have it). The portions are huge. I tend to just roll out of my chair."}
{"text":"Les calmars sont très bon, la salade grec et la sauce maison que j'aime bien mettre sur mes calmars...mmm j'ai bien aimé la pieuvre grillé aussi un délice! Les restaurants achalandé ont des lines up... ceux qui sont trop pressé  de manger n'allez pas la bas, personnellement je n'est jamais attendu plus de 20 min."}
{"text":"Faut etre honnete c'est pas le meilleur restaurant grecque a Montreal.   Pourquoi les gens l'aiment tant que ca: les portions enormes pour le prix. Les calmars frits sont tres bons, meme si ils n'ont rien de special, sont pas cher la livre, mettons. La salade est bonne, le steak est enorme...et puis ca fait un peu cabane a sucre, c'est tres convivial pour la famille.   Ce que j'aime moins, les souvlakis sont vraiment ordinaires, le pain pita est pas bon et la sauce tzatiki est juste correct. La viande manque de ce petit cote grecque qu'on reussit jamais a recreer a la maison?   Pis le line-up...c'est plate attendre pour manger quand tu as faim."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always busy and the food is good but double check your takeout before you leave. We were missing our ceasar salad and the calamari were much more greasy in the takeout order compared to what I've had in the restaurant. I'm not sure that I'd order takeout again but may go to the resto again in the future."}
{"text":"Marveen is the typical Greek restaurant, its been there for decades and its as busy as the early days. The portions are huge and the prices very reasonable. Beside the classic souvlaki and the very garliky tsadziki you have to order the fried calamari, they are very good. Dress confortably and be prepared to wait a bit to have a seat"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for fifteen years. Every summer we come back i visit at least once day. Driving by you would pass it if you didn't even know it was there. It's a little hole in the wall located in an residential area. The porc souvlaki is the best I've ever had. You get 2 sticks of porc, rice, fries and a Greek salad for around $11.00. The sauce they make is incredible, i put that all over my souvlaki, fries and rice. They use to serve sliced bread toasted with olive oil, lemon and oregano on it, loved it. The new bread basket does nothing for me.  It gets crowded and the tables are all set family style, i don't care for that because you never know who is next to you. Other than that this place is a must for really good food. If you have to go use the bathroom downstairs make sure your under six feet, must have been built for trolls."}
{"text":"I love this place! The fantastic sauce on their potatoes are to die for. The warps are well made.Staff is really friendly, but always in a rush. This is a really small hole in the wall. Sometimes there is a ling just for takeout. Food is amazing, you will not regret it, and the prices are good.  The decor is out of date with a huge moose head on the wall. It is also a elbow to elbow type of seating all day long."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Ordered 2 plates, one chicken gyro pita with caesar salad and the second one is 2 pitas one chicken gyro and one souvlaki chicken with greek salad. Got my order and they were all souvlaki, salad both caesar. My gf had a disgusting hair on her sandwich. I called the waiter to ask for another and mentioned to him to make it gyro (at first I thought he mixed up my order), he then said OH WE DONT HAVE GYRO LEFT. Well i appreciate if uve told me that at the beginning when i placed my order, i could have went somewhere else or ordered something different. Disgusting dinning room and washroom. Didnt finish both of our plates and wasted 65$ for nothing. AVOID GOING TO THIS PLACE. NEVER AGAIN MARVENS"}
{"text":"I've been to Marvin's before & of what I remember this used to be one of the best Greek food places. Located in an residential area but very popular with Montrealers. After so many years, I went back on a Tuesday night thinking it would be less crowded, like I remebered it the small diner was full with much noise with the same decor, nothing has been really updated. I sit with my guests waiting for the waiter to come take our orders & trying to understand what one of my guest was asking me . After 10 minutes, the waiter comes with a basket of 3 breads asking if we wanted to drink something, we wanted a brand of Canadian beer but he recommended a Greek one which we excepted since he didn't have what we wanted. We also asked for water which he brought right away, spilling half of it on me. Another 10 minutes passes before he comes to get our orders. Out of the three orders, only one was available (hope so) since it was a porc souvlaki brochette. The other two dishes ( Lamb Gyros & Beef brochette) were not available. It seems they ran out!!!! Finally we get our meals, to my dissapointment,  the souvlaki porc meat was hard, the lamb skewer was extremely salty. The service was not great & the waiter not very efficient ( I guess he was tired of running around & being busy that night ;( . I will definitely not go back to that place , it kind of killed the opinion & experience I had prvious to my visit. It is too bad to see such deterioration in service & taste."}
{"text":"I ordered food here it was okay but the calamari was sooo good one of the best ones in town that made me to go there just for the calamar"}
{"text":"I give this establishment 2.5 stars. It's true that the portions are huge for what you're paying, but really, the food was just like any food court Greek place.  The calamari was probably the best thing I had.  The above would have earned it 3.5 stars for me. Where things went down hill was how cramped everything is. I was pregnant (but not huge) at the time and being short, it was hard to move around without having to go on my tiptoes so I could squeeze between tables and chairs. It just seemed like they try to squeeze in as many people as they can in a confined amount of space.  The line up was indeed long. In the end, for the food and service we received, it was not worth the wait and therefore, we never returned."}
{"text":"This place had me at huge portions.  Taxi'd from downtown here. Nearly missed it! It's a residential area and could be mistaken for a house if it wasn't for the line of people entering the restaurant.  Instantly you see the place packed.   Ordered the rib steak, pork chops and chicken kabobs. ALL HUGE  Rib steak, $27, thin, HUGE, nice charred taste along with it being cooked medium perfectly. So good, BEST THING TO PICK! Pork chops were good, but a bit bland. Cured with some sauce. Chicken was about the same as the pork chops flavor wise, but it was juicy!    French fries, rice pilaf and salad came with all entrees. Rice and salad, GOOD.  Quick, hospitable service.   I'll be back next time I'm in Montreal! Calamari seems like a hit, just be wary of the size of the entrees so you don't have too many leftovers!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it never seems to lessen in quality or service. The decor used to be a lot tackier with the stuffed bear, moose and horse heads but has calmed down considerably over the years (to my dismay!). The servers are prompt and really friendly- the type of server where when it comes to tip, you open up your wallet and say \"take all the monies!\"  We were a party of four and ordered two gyro plates (each has two pitas), a calimari, and a tzaziki. So. Much. Food. The plates are crazy packed with fries, rice, the gyros, a massive salad with your feta, olive and peppers. It's perfect for two people, but an ordeal for one.   We ordered the larger calimari to share and again, way more was given than what was needed to feed four people. They were crisp and fresh, super light, and totally hit the spot. The only criticism is that the smaller pieces were slightly overdone, as it took on a more rubbery texture. But that could just be me trying to be an amateur food critic.  Just go-- and get ready to roll out of this place. Or if you're normal, you'll limit yourself and ask for a takeout box."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL: Huge portions! Whatever you get its very big portions, and you have to order based on it.  I made the mistake of sharing a calamari and ordering a gyros for myself, and couldnt finish either one of them, so had to take it as to go. the gyros is really really good, reminds me of Greece, and it comes with rice and salad sides( I couldnt even eat them). As for the calamari, it's really really good, maybe even the best I've eaten so far in Montreal. As a Turkish person who's been to Greece, I approve this place, and would suggest the calamari for sure."}
{"text":"Marven's    One of the best Greek restaurant    Location: The location is kinda awkward. You enter into a residential area with a large school nearby. The feel of \"one of these thing doesn't belong here\" pops into mind when looking at this restaurant. Strictly on street parking. Beware of the Montreal signs as they may be confusing. Also when winter hits, parking is cut to half. 3/5 stars   Atmosphere: If you've been at a cabane a sucre/sugar shack, it has the same feeling. Depending if they are busy, you maybe seated next to complete strangers. And when I mean next, I don't mean next table, shoulder to shoulder. 4/5 stars   Service: I've been to this place several times. And never once had bad service. Nor do I see waiters being rude to visitors to the city. Hostess alway polite, they alway spot on the wait time. It does get busy at times, but the staff is very efficient at clearing tables. Note to self, they do not take reservations for small groups, first come first serve. 5/5 stars   Food: The quality of food has not changed. Although the portion may have slightly changed, I can't complain, the food is to die for.  Most people go there to try the calamari, and yes it is amazing, must try. One thing I do order on a regular basis is the girlies squid. And my wife's favorite, the lamb chops! I am drooling just thinking about their food. 5/5 stars   Price: Well reasonably priced. For 3 dishes and a side, you're looking to pay about $40-$50. I don't know if they take plastic? Since I've been going there, I've always paid cash. Also I think there's a ATM in the basement next to the washroom. 4/5 stars   Overall: This is one place you need to stop when in Montreal. Great food, great people! 4/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"This is the day where I fell in love with Greek food. Really though. The food there is amazing, plus the portions are huge! The only down side was that my shish kebab was too dry. Other than that, wow!"}
{"text":"A place for meat lovers and sea food enthusiastic. A very good quality to price ratio. Huge portions. Calamari is one the best in town with the grilled octopus that leaves your taste buds asking for more. Ribs steak is very tasty as well as the lamb ribs. I did not like the grilled chicken i had one time, very dry and no flavour.  Most dishes comes with a greek salad or caesar both good. Tzatziki is a must for me each time we visit.  Service is ok , orders get in quickly and usually without mistake . They did mess up the cooking of the meat few times but dishes were rapidly changed. I don't like the decor, its old without having the charm of an old restaurant , outdated plain and simple, however i go there for the food and will definitely go back again and again. 4 stars for the food , 3 stars for the service and decor."}
{"text":"This place has a very special place in my heart. I've been coming here for over 4 years and I've really got to see this place grow and renovate. It should get a 5-star but as of recently, I feel like there's something going on with the food. Not in a bad way, NO ONE is poisoning anybody!   I think I come here once every 5 weeks since their food is so addictingly delicious but I my most recent experience, their lamb chops are getting extremely tiny. I remember how much larger in size they use to be, but now it can't fill up my dad. Their standard greek salad also changed a bit, I believe they might've used different greens, but I feel it was lacking a lot of dressing and flavour (since they are using different greens). My caesar salad as well, normally I never have an issue and I'm just guessing this is only going to happen once, but my salad was premade long before I ordered it and was left in the fridge until I ordered.   Honestly, I wasn't too impressed and would have said something, but I had a feeling it would only happen this one time. Plus I love this place so much, it's a little hard for me to hate it. But I think for a while I won't be going back too soon. Their greek salad and their lamb chops really changed."}
{"text":"It must be a new management/owner because the plate of fried calamari is really very small compared to what it was even last year (and more expensive). Before, you could share a plate with your other half, but now you have to eat also the whole basket of bread to fill full. That's sad because Marven used to be a great place to eat calamari and drink ouzo."}
{"text":"Marvens est mon restaurant de choix quand vien le temps d'aller dinner dans un restaurant Grec. Leurs salade son genereuse, les calamars son leurs plat signature mais il ne faut pas manquer lassiette de Gyros, elle ne vous décevera pas! A part l'achallandage extreme par moment ( ils sont souvent pleins en fin de soirée) c'est un 5 etoiles."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the high expectations of having great calamari.  You should also try the rib steak, not a bad deal for $27, you would not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I do not pass by Park Ex. very often, so given the opportunity I visited Marven's for lunch with my dad. He raved about it, saying Marven's is an institution to the Greco-Canadian community in the area. I am happy we stopped by.   We ordered a demi plate of fried calamari to start, and each an order of the lamb chops. I should also note there is a house salad included with the meal. The salad was nothing special, though the feta was exactly the way I prefer it: not too salty, and not too crumbly. The calamari was tasty (even more so with the house sauce). The batter was flaky but not crispy, and the pieces were quite big.  The main was a plate of lamb chops (cooked medium rare), rice, and french fries. I knew on the first bite of lamb there was something special about Marven's 30+ year old marinade recipe. I doubt it is anything complicated but it has definately made an impact on the way I will approach Greek styled lamb henceforth. Juicy, tender, and tasty! The rice and french fries were a waste - I was too full and they did not make great companions for expertly cooked lamb. The lamb would have been perfect with a side of grilled veg (i.e. eggplants and tomatoes).  For dessert we split a generous portion of baklava. I don't usually like baklava because it is too sweet or too hard. This piece was pure bliss. Heaven.  In all I was satisfied with the meal. The portions are big. The staff is very friendly and punctual. The prices are fair: 2 plates of lamb, a demi of calamari, 2 beers, and a baklava amounted to roughly $75 before tax and tip. I believe Marven's is a must for home style Greek grill, just as La Village Grecque is for gyros."}
{"text":"I mean...you cannot go wrong! When you're in the mood for delicious Greek food (with that amazing house sauce) this is the place to be. You will have to wait sometimes, but a craving is a craving! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff! I love that the steak comes with a salad and garlic bread. Order the calamar it's the best!!!!"}
{"text":"one of the best greek restaurant in montreal , over the years  food did it changed i go here since late 80s , my review about this restaurant is not about the food it's about how dirty yes you guys heard me right dirty it is. carpets are so dirty oil olive is dripping on to the carpets while they are serving the food ? if you look carefully you'll find leftover food under the tables from previous customers it's just not a pleasant thing to see. but most importantly when you leave the restaurant your clothing your hair your skin smells like grease why? poor ventilation , in this restaurant nothing has been changed over the years infact owners are so cheap they dont want to renovate the place. with all the money they make they dont want to put there hande in there pocket   ( i guess they have a scorpion in there pockets ) shame on them for beeing cheap to there loyal customers. i guess they don't care about there clients . to whom it may concern please shut your doors for a month and renovate this stinking dirty restaurant after 50 years its about time what do you think? most of all do something about the ventilation system , buy  some new tables new plates put new flooring make  the restaurant decent again.am I talking to walls? Most probably Iam ."}
{"text":"Marven's is a Montreal-Greek institution, forget Kojax, Arahova Souvlaki, Souvlaki George and any of the other imitators, Marven's is the real McCoy and offers the best damn souvlaki in Montreal and increasingly one of the rare spots to offer lamb souvlaki, the original way it's made in Greece. Marven's also offers easily the best deep fried calamari in Montreal. Light, crunchy and melt-in-your-mouth goodness! There's a reason why there is a virtual line up for a seat here practically every night of the week: the food is amazing, it's as authentic as it gets, huge portions (enough to feed a horse for a week) and very, very reasonable prices. Every Greek person I know in Montreal makes a regular pilgrimage to Marvens and you should too.  Yes, service is brisk, the waiters and waitresses are constantly on the go but they're always friendly. Ok, so the decor is a bit on the tacky side, but so what? Marven's is a place to eat, not to sit pretty. BTW, this is NOT first date friendly food. While the tsaziki is delicious, it's also very garlicky. I've been coming here since the 1970s as a kid, so even if calamari or souvlaki isn't your thing, the quails, the lamb chops and the steak with smothered mushrooms are also winners.  (We've been ordering tubs of the lamb chops as part of our Christmas and Ramadan potlucks in our family for years now and they are ALWAYS the first things to disappear!)"}
{"text":"This place is old school. Some people have imitated, others have even improved it a little. But Marven's is a staple to the Montreal food scene. Still the best calamari in town. The homemade cheesecake is amazing but beware, they often run out. Special mention for the steak and the Marven's sauce. The service is usually friendly and quick. Basically, Marven's is the equivalent of Napoletana but for greek food, which means it's delicious and always packed.   I am awarding 5 stars, not because of the quality. In fact, there is some outstanding greek food in Montreal. The 5 stars is for the wonderful Montreal feeling you get when you are seated at one of their tables.   It's cash only, but they have am ATM. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever received in a restaurant. Having to stand and wait for 25 minutes and getting ignored for requesting a table was really ridiculous. I was very hungry and having the servers be rude was just the worst. I totally would've walked out if I wasn't with friends. To top it all off, I ordered the grilled salmon salad and it was drenched in dressing. There was an actual puddle and it was so inedible. I would advise people to eat somewhere else especially for these prices."}
{"text":"Marven's is like that ugly girl from school that has a \"je ne sais quoi\". Everybody knows she's ugly, but there something her about her that attracts you. Maybe it's her famous Calamari, or grill meats, or even her sweet ass cheese cake -- who knows.   Even after she got work done on her herself (renovations), she's still not the prettiest, but our lust for her is still there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Marvens since the mid 70's, in fact the know this place when it was a dep and then a pizza joint. Owners have been friends from way back. But as we all know times change.  Marvens used to be a 5 star for many many years and leaders in the souvlaki biz. But something went wrong about 7 years ago. Now its all about the money and turnover. Would I go back?? Hell yes I would, its part of me. Their portions are still big, quails used to be amazing but not anymore. Salads not as good as I remember but the Calamari is still good and yero is still decent. Bathrooms there were always gross and then one day they fixed them up but it did not take long before they were back to gross. Avoid going down there. They never took time to keep them clean. Service is poor, same people for years...The girls just do not smile, I remember them b=from way back then when they were pretty and smiled for their tips now they just dont care.  Would I recommend this place?? Yes!!! But they are not the leaders anymore....they gave up the title a long time ago.  Shame"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution when it comes to casual Greek food! I am writing these words and I can still feel my garlic breath from the delicious tzatziki sauce! :)  I saw that a good majority of the patrons ordered the fried calamari for starters. And for good reasons: they are delicious, flavorful and had a nice texture! The batter was light, crunchy, yet not too oily. Like everything in this restaurant, the portion is really big. I had a plate of pork souvlaki pita, chicken gyro pita along with the standard fries, rice and Greek salad. The pork souvlaki was one of the best I had in ages) and the chicken gyro was juicy and very reminiscent of Lebanese chicken shawarma (not necessarily a bad thing!).  Please note that it's cash only. The portion are huge. So one appetizer and one main course might be enough for 2. The seats are communal, which makes it pretty neat actually but probably not a great spot for a first date!"}
{"text":"Much better in the past ... today the food is way too salty  I enjoyed the food last night, but when I got home, I was soooo thirsty and so was my guest.    We had not noticed how salty things were until 1/2 an hour later.  Is this necessary.  Have been going here since 1977.   Update.  We went for the calamari and it was not the same.  Dry and papery.   What happened.  Still salty.   Lamb chops were very tasty,fries and rice were cold  and rice looks like it had been made in the morning and sitting all day."}
{"text":"Was told about this place and finally got to try and was not disappointed.  The fried calamari plate to share (I say this because it is huge), is one of the best of it's kind, not too battered or oily which in and of itself is hard to find.  Last time there we were 6 people so we ordered a Greek salad for everyone to share the calamari plate, the cold and hot pikilia sample  platters, and the mixed grilled plate. Everything was delish, lamb,quail,pork et al..  We all ate and had leftovers and trust me I was with some serious eaters, the cost was really reasonable (while we did not drink much due to over indulging the night before), tax and generous tip was about 170 for 7 peoples!,  the decor is kitch to the max but just lends itself to the meal making you feel like you have just eaten in someones uncles basement for a family get together, the staff is nice and you can tell they take pride in their place so oohing and awing over each dish makes them even happier...."}
