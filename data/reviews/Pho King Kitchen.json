{"text":"Just opened up in our neighborhood.  The food was fresh and pretty good.  They offer a spin on the traditional Vietnamese food with burritos and interesting sounding pot stickers. I really want to try the Sriracha buffalo chicken pot stickers next time. This time I ordered The Great Phoenix King Noodle Bowl with ginger garlic Sriracha braised pork. The pork was delish and I highly recommend it. The noodles were okay. I will definitely be back to try other options."}
{"text":"Like most people who gave this place a low review, I agree the staff was very friendly and the place had a good vibe to it. The drawback was the food didn't taste good at all IMO. It felt like I received food truck quality food at a sit down restaurant. Which I wouldn't really mind, but this place is more on the expensive side for the type of food offered.

I had the chicken and pork fusion tacos. The chicken was extremely dry and chewy which took the flavor away from the taco. The pork was dry as well. This place has potential to be great, but right now I don't think I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Liked:
The greens and condiments are self-serve.  Finally get enough basil and cilantro for my pho, which I love.

Atmosphere is nice with full bar, daily specials and different twists on the traditional menu.

Waiter was helpful and checked on me several times.

Didn't like:
The beef was brisket, not thin-sliced flank slices.  Plus the pieces were chunky thick, with some pieces so big I couldn't fit them on my spoon. Had to chop through them in the soup to make them smaller which was awkward.  The pieces were dry and chewy, not the melt in your mouth flank steak slices I'm used to.

There was hardly any rice noodles in the soup.

The spring rolls had no shrimp, pork or rice noodles.  Instead lots of chunky cucumber and cabbage.  Not the same flavor profile or mouth feel.  Peanut sauce was not very peanutty.

$11 for a pho bowl is a bit pricey but you ARE in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have got different burritos both times. The portions were good and the vegetables were fresh. Also I was impressed with the marinade on both the chicken and the brisket. Other plusses are the nice outside area and the friendliness of the staff. Also, I have never had craft soda from Arizona before so that was a nice surprise. Will come again..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Super sad that they got rid of their spicy Red Chile Beef Dumplings!  In my opinion, that was their best kind.  It was FULL of flavor, and now it's gone.  So sad!  I don't come here as much because that was an order staple.

Their tacos are bomb.  Specifically, I recommend the pork.  They load them up with so much meat!  I just looked at their menu and it looks like they have also done away with their tacos!  Such a bummer.  I'll have to go in and try some of their new menu items.

Three stars because they got rid of some of their best food! :(

Exceptional service."}
{"text":"Food is on point - classic Vietnamese /Asian fare with regional (southwest) influence. I had the Banh Mi and sampled their dumplings -
Flavors were balanced, bright and clean. It was pho king good lol- puny name serious eats"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. 
Great service yummy food very clean. 
First time and it was a great experience.    Love it"}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in. No service, cold soup as the cash register attendant stood and took orders while our food got cold . The cook had a full beard without a beard protector.
The server never asked if the food was ok after reheating the soup. He never came back petiod."}
{"text":"I went for my first time last week and I have to say the food was delicious!!
We went out for dinner and we really enjoyed sitting outside on the patio not to mention the weather was perfect that day. They have vintage string lights outside that give it a chill setting, I personally love it.
 My good friend had Pho and she was very satisfied and I had the Burrito Phoriito for the first time and I also was very pleased with my choice.
If your feeling adventurous and want to try some place new I would recommend it!  
We will be returning soon. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered this on über eats for my second time. The first time I got the medicine man. Very strange broth and the chicken was dry but my food was made fast and got to me very quickly so I thought I would try the traditional one this time around and see if it was any better. It started off ok. But then I realized that there were like 2 rounds of beef and the rest was just like solid tripe. And the tripe was literally just all fat. As the soup cooled down white pieces of fat started to come off the tripe and coagulate. I had to stop eating it and now I'm still hungry. I honestly want to try it again, maybe a different Pho but I don't want to spend $11 for fat soup. :("}
{"text":"This place has the best pho Ive had in a while! Not only that but the pho noodle salad is AMAZING!!! It's super filling and so yummy and flavorful it hardly even needs dressing"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great fusion of Vietnamese and Mexican! Pho was great as were the tacos!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered take out and it was a great deviation from the norm for us. So glad we tried something new, we ordered some Peking Duck & sesame chicken pot stickers - they were good but I did expect them to have specific sauces to enhance the flavors. But again - for the price they knocked it out of the park - they were all gone. We shared the Asian Invasion sandwich and this one was the front runner for sure! The meat alone was seasoned to perfection. Every flavor was necessary and welcomed. Great affordable take out dinner can't wait to try more things!"}
{"text":"I like my Pho hot and cheap. Pho Tanh is reasonably priced. The brisket was delicious, I asked for mine on the side. The Pho was average, but the patio is one of a kind. Looking forward to coming back when I'm itching to have a patio and pho at the same time. Support your local business, cool to know these guys grew from a food truck and now dishing out bowls."}
{"text":"Amazing place for Asian Fusion.  Try the pho with coconut curry or get taco drunk!!! Awesome little hidden bar as well,  with local liquor and craft beers. . This is the best kept secret in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"I really like Pho King. They have great pho (I prefer the pork) and their banh mi burrito is amazing. The restaurant itself is pretty low key. The service is friendly. Great spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Not bad at all never had Pho before but was pretty tasty... would recommend it to people who haven't had pho(since it is fusion). I got the pho with chicken."}
{"text":"My wife had the hippie pho and I had the traditional.  Both broths were a little over salted and on the greasier side. Good portion of meat which was nice, but my wife's hippie pho had little to no vegetables. I recommend tottie's across the street for some insane pho with a ton of vegetables (bigger overall portion for less money too). Service was awesome here, but the pho wasn't 4 star worthy. Will come back to try other food though because of the service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money. If you have any respect for food or how it tastes, you'll agree with me. I could have went out back and picked a handful of slop out of the garbage and saved my money. 

At least advertise what you serve or have some respect for your restaurant and the people eating your food. I couldn't even eat it. Just threw it in the garbage where it belongs."}
{"text":"After driving past the restaurant on my way to wok many a time I decided to stop into the Pho King establishment for some after work eats. I was not only impressed with menu but the service was top notch also. 

The burrito phorrito blew my mind when it finally arrived in my paws. I took bite after bite out of the massive beast, devouring it like a feeding animal. 

Seriously this is one of my favorite places and will be for years to come. Phoking good job guys!"}
{"text":"A local surprise with excellent food, service and tunes. Driving by, outside does not do this neighborhood gem justice. Didn't know what to expect going in and was better than we had imagined. Had fresh spring rolls and massive size tacos. Pho soup at next table looked incredible, will try that next time.  Clean reastaurant and bathrooms. Even had a full bar with great specials! Don't miss out"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lemongrass Curry Coconut Shrimp Pho and the dumplings.  Both were excellent.  Was not expecting it to be that good based on the reviews here.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday.  I had the American Pho and he had the Hippie (vegie) Pho. The broth of my pho was good.  My husband liked the House Sriracha and the miso honey sauce.  The garnishes are at a side bar.  We found that both the fresh basil and the cilantro were not necessarily fresh.  The long haired woman who cashiered also cut the limes for the side bar.  We found the prices high compared to other pho restaurants - Saigon Nites and especially Pho Thanh.  We will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic and I'm a pho fanatic! Try the surf and turf pho bowl, it'll  change your life! This is not traditional pho so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Well yeah it's good.  When you can get someone to pho king help you.  I was on hold for 15 pho king minutes.     \"We are busy\" said the smarmy woman.  Well staff yourselves properly maybe.    Wanna be a restaurant?   Act like it.   Seriously 15 minutes.  Gave up."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, it's quick and you can order food for pickup...  they have their things like sandwiches that look good and so on but can't convince myself not to get pho enough to try them.  Worth a visit"}
{"text":"Talk about an overrated dump!  Miserable service if you are some cool hipster. Mediocre food that's a watered down unauthentic version. Who cares if it's cheap if it's inedible. Staff barely cares and just looks at you blankly.  

Pho-get-about it! Go anywhere else to feel welcomed for spending your money."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place and went in tonight to eat there. We waited 40 minutes for our food!! It seemed busy but the line wasn't long or out the door or anything. I was also mind blown when a customer came in and ordered take out and waited only about 20 minutes for their food. Also when we got our food it wasn't even hot!! Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Pho was greasy and didn't have a lot of noodles in it.  I guess in a pinch it would be ok.   The spring roll had a tiny bit of chicken..  the rest was all cabbage and carrots.  Staff was nice.   Overall meh and not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Staff was super friendly and accommodating the food was 10/10.   Easy go to spot for pho.   Has Portland / Austin feel to it   Good food"}
{"text":"Got ginger pork dumplings are they are soooooooo good. Loved the flavor and really good combination with hot chilli. On the other hand do not recomend the salad. No flavor what so ever and the chicken didn't tasted good . Left out all the chiken. Like it was there for days. Not fresh at all. And don't get me wrong maybe pho will be better than the salad. Maybe will try it next time."}
{"text":"Went here today, second time 8/12/26. Please thank all who worked today. Great job!! This place had energy/ Flavors and draft beer specials. Everything was excellent!!! We really enjoyed our stir fry with shrimp and a draft beer San Tan Mr. Pineapple. They have many sauces at the condiment bar, so you create what your
palate craves... So yummy! With unbeatable specials we will make this a staple! Thanks again for the great meal and service."}
{"text":"Had the 'Chef's Choice' Noodle Bowl with Brisket. Everything was done to perfection  and very flavorful! The house Chardonnay was delicious and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual with an outdoor garden befitting the Reggae music playing. This new establishment deserves to be checked-out! The bar may be my new neighborhood 'go-to' place!"}
{"text":"Pho king pho-nomenal! I've been addicted to Pho and a Taco every Tuesday and I can't stop getting pho'll. All the houses and veggies all up in thurr. Love it"}
{"text":"I'm very sick today, and this restaurant was exactly what I needed. 

I ordered the Tradition Pho with housemade dumplings. The were actually out of the dumplings I wanted but they were able to switch it to Fried Spring Rolls instead. 

The food is A+! They make different sauces in house to accompany your meal. The Tenneseeasian BBQ was fantastic.

Shout out to BRI, it was her first day but she took really good care of me.

Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a sandwich at McDowell Music Fest when they were a food truck, it is understandable why they have a restaurant now. Food is awesome with traditionally Vietnamese and they mixed it with American beef and pork although a lot is mainly vegetarian dishes. Please come and enjoy the flavor as the location is kind of hidden but full bar and I hope people learn about this place as the location makes it hard. I cannot wait to try more items on the menu"}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times and decided to stop in. I've never had pho or asian fusion and decided to try. I ordered the surf and turf pho and chicken rolls to go. The cashier was very nice and explained things on the menu and recommended sauces to try. I went home and was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen stocked me up on the sauces and everything I'd need. They didn't forget a thing which is always a worry with takeout. The whole meal was very interesting to me, which is a good thing. The veggies were fresh and crisp and I loved the pho but I loved the fresh chicken rolls even more! The brisket could have been better but I've never had it in soup before maybe it was supposed to be that way. A little tough and could have been a tad more flavorful. The broth made up for it tho! I really liked it all and tell people about it. I want to go again very soon and try something else!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. The girl who took our order was horrible she was so rude. Obviously very miserable working there. I'll not be coming back for this reason. This is why it has three stars."}
{"text":"The best pho I've had in such a long time..the Bahn Mi so different but in the best way  the staff are very friendly it's super clean...I'm from Palm springs CA and I would drive all the way here just to eat this bomb food.."}
{"text":"The pho was good but the price was steep compared to other places I have been. The staff was friendly. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is funky but the food is so fresh, carefully and creatively prepared, and at a great price!  Loved it."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pho King burrito a little pricy but worth a try. Dank sauce is good too. Great experience but a little pricy to be a returning customer"}
{"text":"The number one problem with this place is the price. I was going to buy a burrito but it was $8.99, PLUS THE COST OF MEAT!  No burrito on this Earth is worth that much. 

Ended up ordering the Great Pho King Noodle Bowl, which was good enough. I decided to splurge and pay $1 each for fried egg and coconut curry. Plus $2.50 for some chicken. Base price is $8.50. It had some rice noodles, pickled daikon & carrots, a ton of spring salad mix (I had to remove about half of it), cucumbers, and jalapeños. The sauce is just some sweet chili sauce served on the side. It was good and a decent amount of food, but it wasn't $13 good. 

One thing that MAY have me try them again is their delicious craft fountain drinks. I ordered the pineapple cream soda and it was absolutely delicious. 

Also, the ginger pork dumplings were really good. If I go back I'll definitely get them again

Over all I was very unimpressed.  I realize it's a fusion restaurant but I think they're trying too hard and missing the mark."}
{"text":"I tried the Pho American- All the usual condiments are available.  The broth was less complex and more watered down but sufficient.  It was not overly sweet or with too much anise.  The amount of beef made the pho dish substantial.  it is a small casual place with parking in the back and also has a bar off in a separate area.  Pepsi products for drink, and a Vietnames brand of Siracha that is good.   I will visit again."}
{"text":"Upon entering this lovely hipster place,
I found it to be very interesting.
Great vibe going,
Friendly staff 
Great idea 
 Pho broth needs work
*defenitly cut down on the oil* 
 I looked and looked, and decided to try the Curry Pho and the fried plantain chips, togo.
I got it home an was excited to try it.
The plaintains where very tough, over fried and the Curry Pho, I am not a fan 
Too oily for my taste and  I am not sure that fusion works in terms of pho.
There is too much oil its is  littery swimming in oil.
I can not in good conscience give this place higher than 3 stars.
Perhaps I tried the wrong things."}
{"text":"The food truck was near my work today and I tried the Pho w/chicken. I thought it was very good, but I am no authority on Pho as this was my first try. The veggies were fresh tasting and looking and it was a substantial portion for the price. Would like to try the restaurant sometime. I hope they come back!"}
{"text":"Tried the Traditional pho for the first time. It was a good experience for me. Never had tripe or tendon before and it did take some confidence to chow down, I did really enjoy it. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Loved their selection of beers and sake. I didn't know that Vietnamese dumplings were basically pot stickers, I was expecting more of a Japanese or Chinese dumpling, so that was my bad. Their house made sauces were fantastic!! The Tennessee Asian BBQ sauce brought my taste buds back to Nashville!! The only improvement was that their fresh herb bar wasn't so fresh... Everything was wilted and browned or super dried out (limes, cilantro, bean sprouts)... It was like 8:45/9 but you can tell it had been there longer than a day... Overall it was good! And since it's super close to home we'll be back when we're in the mood for a decent pho!"}
{"text":"Large selection and 1 of the best Pho I have had in the area. Very open relaxed environment. I strongly recommend the Traditional Pho for your first time."}
{"text":"It was my first time and I haven't had a chance to try a lot of the items on the menu but I did try their pho and I don't think it competes with actual pho restaurants in the valley. Personally, what makes a good pho is flavorful broth and I always get a few sips in before adding any sauces. Sadly, this one was kind of bland. I've never eaten from the food truck so I didn't know what to expect. For first timers, don't expect traditional Vietnamese cuisine. I had their plantains too and that was so-so. I also thought the food was a bit pricey. 

Some positive notes are that their tacos and burrito looks promising. My wife had the shrimp taco and she liked it so I'll probably come back to try other things. Customer service was great and they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this was the worst Pho I have ever had. The broth was horrible and the meat was in ridiculously tiny pieces. We actually had to ask them if they forgot to put it in! I would not recommend it if you want Pho. We didn't try anything else on the menu so I can't comment on their other food options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had high hopes for this place but were unfortunately let down. Coming from Boston, we had a go to Pho spot that never let us down. I always got the Dac Biet which would be the traditional at Pho King Kitchen. Not only was there no tendon or tripe to speak of even though both are listed on the menu, but the meat was very over cooked and the broth completely lacked a depth of flavor. I don't understand the addition of the flavorless meatballs, either. My boyfriend has the surf and turf and his initial reaction was that it tasted like water. The broth is really, really weak. It wasn't inedible, but very underwhelming. I'd like to try their burritos sometime, but I'll never get the \"Pho\" again. Especially considering we could a get an authentic helping twice the size for $8 in Boston."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very great price and the pho is amazing. I read a review on here that said the broth was \"tastless\" and that's just far from true.. the house sriracha is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place cero starts I would. And if you're looking for pho just don't even bother going there, it's bad."}
{"text":"Fun new place just opened in Scottsdale. Love the name!  There is a food truck and a dine in / take out restaurant. 

I had lunch in the dining room. I'm not crazy about ordering at a counter and picking up from a kitchen window. This is probably a nod to the food truck experience. 

I ordered Ginger Pork Potstickers and a Burrito Phorrito with Slow Roasted Brisket.

I didn't care for the Potstickers. First, they were deep fried rather than pan fried, which is my least favorite way of doing potstickers. I honestly prefer steamed to deep fried. I don't like the chewy texture. The potstickers were generally bland and accompanied with a small container of mango chili sauce that was pretty much flavorless. No spicy kick, no sweet either. Just bland. I also suspect that these potstickers are not house made. I could be wrong on this.

However, the Burrito Phorrito was excellent. Lots of flavorful stir fried vegetables, kimchi, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. There were bottles of soy sauce, Sriracha, and Hoisin on the table. If they had fish sauce, it would have been perfect.

I will go back for the burrito again, but skip the potstickers. 

I had these two items and a glass of water, bill including tax and 20% tip came to over $24."}
{"text":"Flavor and portion of tge Pho was good, prices were OK, service was OK (but not great) and the dining area was very dark, dirty & dingy. Ew. Probably wont be back unless that changes. I dont want to know what the kitchen looks like ."}
{"text":"Tonight I visited Pho King and the food was amazing. I got the Surf & Turf Pho with extra meat and the Fresh Shrimp Spring Rolls. It was the perfect amount of food for two people. The Pho broth was really flavorful and the beef was super tender. If you get your Pho to go, remember to go to their garnish bar for any basil, cilantro, sprouts, peppers, sauces or limes. They only include a tiny portion of garnish in the to go bag. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in earlier today, the ambient is good. The cashier that took our order was kind and offered good customer service. They had good music playing and the place looked cleaned. I ordered the hippie pho (vegetarian) and their stir fry and one of their home made cupcakes. The stir fry was really good. Had a lot of vegetables and the sauce they used gave it a good kick. The pho on the other hand was not so good. I read a few reviews and a good amount of them state that their pho isn't good. I have to agree with them. It's not the authentic pho you'd expect from a typical pho restaurant. The broth was a bit too salty. Too salty to the point that I couldn't add any sauce to it cause it would just be a sodium over load lol. I ended up not eating the pho. Over all this place is pretty cool I'd say give it a try but probably not the pho."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes so good. Fresh spring rolls are super filling and definitely get both sweet chili sauce and peanut sauce. I got the American phõ and my sister got the hippie phõ, the meat in the American was heaven!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god you guys I pho king found the best pho around! I love this place for the fact that you can get traditional flavors but also a great mix of fusion as well.  The broth in the lemongrass curry coconut is rich and creamy with a hint of nuttiness. The Medicine Man pho is exactly what you need if
you are feeling a bit under the weather.  The portion sizes are enough for two meals!  I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu.  I live on 7th ave and Osborn but own a salon in Old Town Scottsdale and drove out of my way to get dinner to take home.  I am a fan and a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"I came for the f@&$%#£$ delicious Pho! Traditional tastes with a sweet new culture spin! Second time coming. Just as great as the first great surprise walking in seeing this place. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews. If the food is not good to me, I just move on. But the whole experience tonight...I'll just leave to you to judge. I'll try to be brief.
I ordered a Traditional Pho (thin sliced beef round, tripe, tendon, & meat ball) with extra noodles and double meat, to go. When I got it home there was basically meat ball and a few small pieces of tripe. There might have been some tendon, but definitely no sliced beef. The only double meat I could see was possibly the meat ball. Ok, mistakes happen, so I call to see if I was given the wrong order. The girl tells me, 'I checked it myself, that's what you ordered'. No, sorry, there is no beef in here, just meatballs and a few pieces of tripe. She says I can bring it back and they'll remake it. So, back I go. I show her the soup, and what's NOT in it and she just takes it back to the kitchen and comes back out without saying anything else to me. So I politely ask her what happened? Did I misunderstand something? \"Oh, I don't know. I don't eat the beef.\" Hmmm, I thought you said you checked it? The order comes back up and she gives it to me. Opens it up and shows me the meat inside. I'm not a demanding person, but there was no 'sorry for the mistake', and quite honestly I kind of felt they were irritated that they had to fix my order. Just before I leave I see what looks like a cook through the pass through window, so I ask him what happened and he tells me something about everything is weighed out to 2oz and somehow the traditional I ordered got confused for a meatball with double meatball. It didn't really make sense, but whatever, I'm hungry and just want to eat, despite the poor customer service. As for the food...The broth was bland and the double noodles were mushy. I ate the meat, which if it was doubled it was not worth the extra $3.50. Still Pho-king hungry, I threw the noodles and the rest of the broth out. They did however give me another pack of noodles with the replacement soup. I was just about to toss those but they actually felt pretty good; nice and al dente like they should be. I ate them with the soup packet from a  Top Ramen. Much more flavorful than their broth."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this spot. Reading the reviews I knew not to expect the normal Vietnamese restaurant... And it turned out great. Had Pho which had a rich beef broth and I chose the brisket for my protein. It was soooo good. Loved the basil bar with cilantro and all the fixins. Paired it with the ginger pale ale. I would come back. $8 was a reasonable price for the Pho. Great take out place and indoor dining area with patio."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling well and was craving Pho. I rarely write reviews but my God this is the saltiest Pho I have ever had. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Really good pho! It's not exactly traditional pho, but they've got some great inclusions. We really enjoyed the coconut curry."}
{"text":"Good pho. Cool, hip vibe. Kung fu movies on the tv and classic punk being played over the PA. (i.e. 70-80s vintage Dead Kennedy's and sex pistols). Good fresh food .dinged just one star for value. Small bowl of surf and turf- $7 plus $1 for extra veggies came to $10 with tax and tip. Bowl should have been larger even if they only added broth and noodle. Otherwise, good product."}
{"text":"This might be a great food truck idea but not sufficient enough to be an Asian-inspired restaurant. The (self)-service was decent, but the food itself was mediocre.

Pho bowl: Just reading the description on the menu you can already tell there's going to be a problem with the \"1 cup of rich broth\". How is 1 cup of broth enough for noodle, protein, and veggies? It's not. The \"rich\" broth for my braised pork pho bowl was flavorless and tasted like it was watered down with 2 cups of water. Though the broth needed more work done, the braised pork I had was decent and cut up into bite size pieces.

Suggestions: 
- Don't water down your broth and maybe have your veggies on a separate dish so diners can choose what they want.
- Beef up your eating utensils - this is a restaurant, not a food truck, have real chopsticks and soup spoons!
- Having cloth napkins doesn't make the restaurant \"classy\". Let's be realistic... When people are eating spicy flavorful food, their nose will be running and don't necessarily want to wipe their snot with non-absorbent cloth napkins."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional pho, which I thought was pretty good. I was impressed with the service. I was waiting about 20 min for my food. The staff apologized and brought me a cupcake. Winning. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered pho king via uber eats (haiii uber eats, love you!) I got a pork taco, shrimp spring rolls and an order of chicken pho. The pork taco was awesome! The shrimp spring rolls are different, very veggie forward without much shrimp (whatever) and last but not least the pho was really disappointing. The broth was not normal pho broth, but chicken broth instead. And that's why they're getting three stars. The portion was fairly small, which I honestly prefer, and the chicken itself was incredible. However they're cooking it is working for them. They really need to beef up their broth so to speak, but over all everything was fine. I think I'll stick to the place by my house, I prefer authenticity over hipness; the Mexican-Vietnamese fusion concept is interesting. I will gladly change my review the moment they change their pho broth base. Pho you might offer, but you're certainly no king. Get it together, guys! Love the pun that is your namesake, but for goodness sake, live up to your name!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Pho, this is not the place to go to. The broth is pretty much flavorless and the meat is really processed. Please go to a real Pho restaurant, you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"My normal Pho place was closed during the holidays SOOOO, I went a tad further to Pho King! It was SO different than I expected!! Trendy, hip hop vibes with a unique fusion menu. They have your traditional Pho, but they also have unique twists as well. Some versions include Curry and one that has a Mexican flair. 

I went with their \"Medicine Man\" Pho which has loads of chicken and green vegetables. The veggies consisted of cauliflower, green beans, zucchini, onions, cabbage, broccoli, and i'm probably missing some. IT WAS SO GOOD YOU GUYS. I also got their fresh Spring Rolls which were also to die for. I wasn't the biggest fan of the peanut sauce - just needed to be a tad saltier in my opinion but all in all, they were EXACTLY what the doctor ordered. They have a sauce/topping bar with a variety of homemade sauces, limes, bean sprouts, herbs, etc. (Fun Fact: If you have a sauce bar - i'm automatically your fan!)

The service at the front wasn't the friendliest but hey, the food is good errrr \"pho-king\" amazing! I will absolutely be back. I can't wait to try one of their burritos. Banh Mi Burrito - i'm looking at you! They also have food trucks so you may just see them around town!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service came in on 6/5 for lunch. Our first time and it was a let down! Didn't even greet us. Had attitude when asking what we wanted to eat. I get working sometimes drains you but if you can't smile and respect the customers in your business...I'd look somewhere else for better food."}
{"text":"This place used to be good- last time I went was the last time. Super salty pho not at all flavorful. I ended up throwing my pho away so can't say I recommend spending money here. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Pho in a fun and vibey way. Loads of extra condiments and house made sauces to add til your hearts (and belly's) content.   Super fun and creative yet true and authentic pho flavors.  Go go go.  Like, now."}
{"text":"This review is for a recent visit on a Friday evening around 7:00pm and were one of a few tables but the place started to fill up shortly afterwards and was doing a brisk take out business which slowed the kitchen down a bit.  Spring rolls again were great but I'd like to see shrimp as an option instead of chicken.  Dumplings were refreshingly different with the fresh ingredients and the stir fry was great, we ordered at the counter and the food was brought to our table."}
{"text":"We decided to come to this restaurant after hearing such great things about it. Unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations. We got pho & spring rolls. The broth for the pho was very different then I was expecting. It was also very salty as if it was sitting at the bottom of the pot all afternoon. The spring rolls were better than the soup (we ordered shrimp) but there was only one little half shrimp in it."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've had pho, this is the best. It's extremely clean, and the energy here is like no other. I was at the condiments bar and this guy John came to explain to me how the sauces are made and recommend his favorites to me. It was super cool. They all made me feel like I was part of a family. And Karen was super cool too. But let's not forget about the food, soooo good.... only once they skimped on the Veggies but once I said something they came out with a new pho no questions asked, that's awesome customer service. Love this place. This will continue to be a staple in my family."}
{"text":"First time here. Couldn't finish after first bite. I'm waiting on the pho but not expecting too much... Disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been very excited to try this place out, so finally I got the chance to try it. I'm not one to write a negative review, but the service was so poor I didn't even stay to try the food. The woman who was taking our order was impatient and kept walking away while we were ordering to do something else and was incredibly rude when I tried to make a modification on my pho. I am a server myself, so I understand someone getting overwhelmed with a busy day, but this was horrible! Please get better service and I will come back."}
{"text":"Resturant was very clean and inviting. Mike was definitely quick to help. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about every menu item. I ordered 2 different tacos. The beef was pretty good, I was definitely satisfied with it. Now the pork taco, AMAZING!!! The pork was tender and definitely flavorful. I absolutely loved this place and not only will I recommend this hidden gem but I will definitely be back. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Pho has an alright flavor.  It is a little pricey, though.  It is certainly not worth what they charge for it.  I would highly recommend heading to one of several options in the Tempe area for much more authentic and better priced pho.  We also had the beef stir fry and again were underwhelmed and shocked at the price.  Too bad, I really wanted to love this place since I tried the stir fry from their food truck at one of the local food truck vendor events in Scottsdale and thought it was great."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, and being part Asian I definitely have high expectations for Asian food-as well Asian fusion because it can definitely go wrong. I got the Banh Mi sandwich and a side of spicy chips and now I'm literally in a food coma because I couldn't stop eating it (and it's only lunch time)! The girl at the counter was very personable and prompt with my takeout order. When I got home I was completely amazed how crunchy the chips were (was expecting them to get at least a little soggy during the drive) and how flavorful, fresh, and high quality my sandwich was (no soggy veggies or chewy pork here). I will have to try the Pho next time!"}
{"text":"Small quaint spot. They have a small bar and nice space outside on the patio. The paintings/decor are fitting and great for groups of 4 Maybe 6...
Came with 2 small kids and they enjoyed their food so that's usually a great indicator for us on our interpretation of kid friendly.  
Menu gave options but was perfect in not overwhelming so, easy to decide. Took a little long from when we ordered BUT we did come an hour before close so I won't Harp on it. Also the staff was super helpful in describing taste :)
We ordered the American and the chicken stir fry. We pretty much cleaned our plates/bowls. Super yummy, it was super light and filling. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We live across the street and are so happy Pho King opened up a permanent location here! There's nothing I don't love about this place! The pork tacos are absolutely amazing, so is the Ginger Mint Cucumber Sake Sangria. SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Very happy to find great Service and energy.  Followed by delish yellow curry coconut shrimp pho'.. I'm usually a purist and go same o same o.  But veered off took a chance and oh boy was it a great surprise!!  Also tried a spring roll.. Very nice light, crisp  and fresh
 Can't wait to frequent and try on down the menu!  New fav pho' yay!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I'm always in the area of their brick and mortar location. The menu and concept works a lot better for a food truck but they're going to have to step up their game if they want the restaurant to be successful.  There's only 8 items on their menu and you pick up your food at the food window.  I understand they're trying to keep overhead cost down with picking up your own food but $10 for a mediocre small bowl of pho is a little excessive.  Didn't think there was value in my meal and that's what it takes when I consider another trip back."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get my Pho fix. If its ever raining out and you wanna stay in and watch Netflix, this is a great go to for a pick up order. They are always prepared and reasonably priced. Highly recommend picking something but I have never dined in."}
{"text":"My review is for the brick and mortar restaurant.

This small restaurant is located on a very busy street in South Scottsdale so it can be a tough to break into the traffic to get in or out. They offer a patio for outside dining and do offer what looks like a full bar. This is a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and pick up your food at the pick up window. The playful fusion cuisine is sort of Asian and slightly American -Mexican. They offer pho, a few appetizers, stir fry, burrito phorritos, banh mi burritos and a special of the day.

I had the Burrito Phorrito ($8.00) with added Chicken ($2.00). It was a little different than what you might imagine it to be and was made with spicy hot pickled cauliflower that was ice cold in the burrito. The chicken in the burrito was developed with flavors and was moist. Other ingredients were sautéed vegetables, a mild kimchi and a Sriracha Mayonnaise to pull everything together. I thought the burrito was tasty but would have been better if the pickled cauliflower was broken down into smaller pieces and wasn't ice cold in the burrito. The cauliflower made the burrito only luke warm at best when I ate it. The burrito could have also used some time on the grill for my taste. Still it was tasty just not technically perfect.

We each had one Buffalo Sriracha Pot Sticker ($1.50@) I thought the filling was nicely flavored but I didn't like that the potsticker was deep fried. The potsticker was also very tiny. They seemed very expensive for what they were.

My husband also had the Burrito Phorrito but with Brisket. The brisket was the fatty kind and also was developed with good flavors. Not sure why but the brisket burrito was leaking oil and was very oily inside. 

The menu on-line differs slightly from the menu in the restaurant.

The Pho King Kitchen is worthy a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"Shocking. I, too, used Uber Eats and ordered the Burrito Phorito with chicken and extra sauce. It showed up as a tortilla chock full of white rice, a few bits of cauliflower, and a few carrots. That's all. No chicken, no kimchee, no sauce (let alone \"extra\", as ordered), no cheese, stir-fried veg or cilantro-lime rice. And it definitely wasn't garnished with green onions. I don't recommend eating here. Waste of money, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"BEST Pho & Asian fusion in Phoenix!! Highly recommend! Everything on the menu is SO bomb ! My favorites are The Traditional Pho, The American Pho & the chicken stir fry! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The tacos are the best. And the sriracha buffalo chicken dumplings. Eat here. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Soup here is Pho King disgusting. Pho arrived at the tabled WITHOUT noodles! LOL! Sent it back and the white hipster cashier/server made it seem like this wasn't the first time this had happed. Luckily the Mexicans in the kitchen quickly added some noodles. Try Noodles Ranch across the street, their food is way better, where actual Asians cook and serve your Asian food."}
{"text":"Hostess/cashier is really friendly and helpful. She has really good customer service skills.

Some customers came in who were looking at the menu and she asked them if it was there first time, asked if they had any questions about the menu, and explained things to them. That kind of service should be standard, but it's rare nowadays and stood out in a good way.

The wait to pickup has always been reasonable and she is quick and efficient bagging the orders (and really pleasant to deal with). Thank you"}
{"text":"Not impressed very little pho soup no meat the only thing that was good was their sauce the spring rolls was very rubbery and dried chicken won't visit again"}
{"text":"This place was pleasantly surprising. 

A change from the traditional Viet restaurant setting with cafeteria style choices of sauces and sides (Their House Sriracha was good).

Staff was friendly especially the man working the front, approachable and checked up on us a few times.

The portion of their Pho dishes weren't what'd you expect but it's enough (and you can grab as much sides as you'd want!):
Traditional: Not really a fan of tripe, the meatballs kind of taste like Swedish meatballs
Coconut Curry Shrimp: Plenty of shrimp! The broth was alright couldn't really taste the coconut curry it claims.
Surf n' Turf: Not as much shrimp, the brisket was tender.
(6pc.) Dumplings:
-Sriracha Chicken: Not really spicy, side ranch sauce was good.
-Sesame Chicken: Kind of bland, sweet chili sauce was good."}
{"text":"By far the bottom of the list for Pho in the nearby area. There are at least 6 Phoenix restaurants in a 2 mile radius and unfortunately we choose Pho King this time. Over salted, lukewarm, and overpriced are the three comments we both agreed on. My Pho was served without noodles as well. I had to ask if that's how they served it and they added cold noodles to the already lukewarm broth. Even the garnish bar was sad. Empty trays missing limes, basil, and jalapeños. The staff should spend more time taking care of customers, cleaning, and replenishing rather than gossiping and texting. We were truly disappointed and left still hungry."}
{"text":"Not Pho King Bad! 4.25 Star Food, 5 Start Service...

Not traditional but good.

So starting off you are greeted warmly by the blonde girl Lauren at the counter. She has a good sense of humor. She is also getting married in 7 weeks so wish her well!

You order your food and the Pho is not traditional Asian style but is rather refreshing and good. Ask for some garlic chili paste to add in for the best taste of you like spicy. 

The Banh mi chicken burrito is an unusual little burrito. Tasty for sure... Just not what you expect from a Mexican burrito... Give it a try and you'll like it."}
{"text":"Normally this place rocks! Stopped in yesterday for 2 tacos to go (chicken & beef). Got back to work and it was not like the menu described regarding the \"accroutrements.\" It was just tortilla, meat (generous!) and garnish (red cabbage, raw onion, and cilantro). No pickled jalapenos or sri racha mayo (bf); or thai basil aioli and pickled root veg (chix) - as promised on the online menu. So, w/out the goodies - they were bland, and dry. Hoping this was a one-time oversight. Normally would rate at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho is just one the reasons to eat here. Incredible soft tacos, noodle dishes also should be had.. on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I actually don't love writing negative reviews about the quality of food for some reason it just makes me feel bad. Poor service I'm all over that but this was such a horrible food experience for me I had to warn you poor souls so you don't make the same mistake I did. 

ATTENTION!!!!! If you were going to order the Pho....DON'T!! I didn't even think it was possible to make Pho inedible but these guys managed it! I literally couldn't finish it. The \"broth\" is basically starch water - there's absolutely no taste to it. The noodles they delivered were kind of rubbery in texture. I'll give them props on the veggies, they were cooked properly and there was a nice variety and a lot of them but listen guys this is SOUP. The broth is the key and you made the WORST broth I've ever tasted in my life. I'm not sure about their other dishes but the Pho should be removed from the menu. Total waste of time and money and I'm still hungry or rather now hangary ....UGH!"}
{"text":"Solid food fun place. Nice big patio and good size portions!! There are other things on the menu that are really good too! Also they seem to look of the the locals...local beer, soda, booze...etc!! 

The name"}
{"text":"Restaurant review . . .

First, the service has been incredibly friendly. Both times we've been there the waiters have been very helpful, fun to talk with, and incredibly personable. Our first time there the kitchen made the wrong sandwich, and he brought out the wrong one and explained I could munch on that while they made the right one. They also voluntarily told us the plantains were not yet ripe enough, and discouraged us from the chips and the dessert. (twice - gees, guys, buy them earlier, won't you?!?)

The food - awesome. Seriously the best Bahn Mi I have ever had. Granted, my sample size is not huge, but this thing is awesome. And the house-made buns . . . really, you have to try it. I cannot do it justice with mere words. It's more emotional than that. For those of who love bread, anyway.

My wife got the Pho our first trip, and I almost regretted getting the Bahn Mi. It was terrific. And my sample size in that regard is much larger. Truly enjoyable, very flavorable.

Highly recommended. And how often do you get to tell your spouse, \"Let's go to the Pho King restaurant, already!\"?!?"}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good!  Weird location, but I will definitely be back.  The girl at the counter was very friendly.  They had some great sauces like house made Sraicha, miso honey, Dank Herb Sauce...all very good!  The Buffalo Chicken dumplings (i know it sounds weird) were really good and the Pho was very flavorful and the meat was nice and tender.

The owner was doing some work but took time to thank me when I left.  Great experience all around...I hope these guys are successful...too many great restaurants never survive more than a year or two...but i think these guys are on to something for sure!"}
{"text":"I could give 1 star because the service was so bad. I honestly felt like the Hipster douche management wanted to get in an altercation with me. The waitress was nice but the service was very sub par. 

On a scale of 1 to 10 the food was a 7. I got the stir fry burrito with chicken. The duck sauce was probably the best part of the experience and it was bottled and available to anybody in the asian aisle of the supermarket.

I will not be going back anytime soon if I can help it."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Service was very fast and the staff was informative and friendly. Everything we had was fresh. I love their pho bar. You have everything at your disposal to make you pho extra amazing! Also had the All Thai'd Up. It's one of the most delicious quesadilla creations ever!"}
{"text":"They just opened up their new restaurant in Scottsdale. (The paint was literally still drying, well at least you could still smell the paint). Friendly service. The food was great and the portion sizes are big. I got the stir fry dish with the garlic braised pork and it was really tasty. I look forward to coming back and trying something else on the menu. It's great to support local people trying to make a go at it. Reasonable prices for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I didn't even expect good food or service because i read yelp reviews before I walked in. But seriously? Pho burrito and thai seasoned french fries? Purple cabbage in my spring roll? They weren't even served with peanut sauce. I'm sorry but all the house sauces they have got to offer were disgusting. Mainly because I'm not used to the fish sauce smell but they tried to put too much in one."}
{"text":"Really good faux viet food. More expensive than typical Vietnamese food but I guess that's the cost (passed on to customers) to Americanize it. There's not a lot of places to find a banh mi in Phoenix but they make a good one."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice people....but, come on, Canned Costco chicken in the Chicken Pho???   Really?   I have been there one other time and got the brisket.  It was good, but seemed like a 2oz brisket serving.  Broth and noodles were fine, but not screaming good.  Nice independent soda company for their fountain drinks, so maybe go there for a soda, but skip the Pho.   Bummer, this place is so close to my office, I really really really.....really, wished it was better."}
{"text":"Wow! I asked for a stir fry with vegetables of my choice. Delicious flavor. 
Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm here every week. The food keeps getting better and better. Friendly staff and amazing sandwiches on Iranian bread."}
{"text":"Not worth the price.  Tacos, spring rolls, and \"the American\" were all flavorless and bland.  The spring rolls were not terribly fresh (both trader Joe's and pei wei are wayyy better and half the price) and both the chicken spring rolls and pho had hardly any meat in them.  The burritos are bizarre in that they have huge chunks of cauliflower in them that are dowsed in vinegar which does not go well in a cheesy burrito. We ordered via delivery and got one tiny salsa container for 6 tacos.  The tacos only came with raw cabbage and onion and again very little meat.  The pho is $10 watery broth with bean sprouts which they somehow think is a clever garnish.  Plus my bf and I both had stomach aches/cramps after eating."}
{"text":"Very disappointing visit to Pho King Kitchen. They use to have best dumplings in town. 
There was this cute Asian girl that worked there that made the best dumplings. I asked for her but come to find out she no longer works there. I order 6 dumplings. Now no where on the menu does it say they all have to be the same, and last time I was there I did a mix and match. So the girl takes my order  and my money. About a min later I'm informed that they won't make that order for me. Mind you I'm the only customer in the store. You would think they would make my order then let me know they don't usually do that. Not even a sorry for the inconvenience or misunderstanding. So I went with all Ginger pork. As you can see in the pic there was barely any pork in them, they were loose, slimy and tasteless. Not 1 of the 5 people working lcame out to check on the one customer they had. All and all a bad experience and I won't be going back or recommending this Pho King place to anyone. There are way too many restaurants around to have to put up with bad customer service and sub par food."}
{"text":"Not pho. It's noodles and broth. Hardly ANY flavour. Pho is delicious because of the rich, wonderful and complex bone broth. Wanted to love this place. Came in with an open mind, I eat pho at least once a week so I am somewhat an expert!  I Was so disappointed! Just BLAND! Like three green onions in the bowl!! Usually I am slurping the juice to the very bottom, but here i didny even care to finish . Just So generic!! Spring rolls were served with peanut butter and a splash of soy sauce. I don't care about fusion or whatever if that means you are taking all of the flavor out ! For 6 bucks you could go eat a real bowl of pho at  siagon nites and leave satisfied for a good 5 days before the craving kicks in. I will not be back, I don't understand the reviews...these people must have never had real pho before!"}
{"text":"This place was Pho King terrible. Got the stir fry with beef brisket and I couldn't even eat any of the brisket because it was all fat (literally all of it, which is very disappointing considering you have to pay extra just for the meat). After removing all the meat, my stir fry was edible, but bland. Tasted much better after drowning it in sriracha sauce. Overall, not a great experience, and I don't think I'll be coming back. Best part of the meal has to be the Sprite."}
{"text":"I am so delighted this place is close to my home. It really helps with making my obsession easier . The broth ... Oh the broth . 
I usually get the American , it has tender brisket in it. You can order the pho with different broths , with or without meats ... Whatever you like . They have spring rolls , crispy chips with spices , tacos ... So good ! Sandwiches rock , and don't forget the dank herb sauce . I order it ALL and bring it to my family at least once a week ."}
{"text":"Love the pho soup, the burritos are a great twist on traditional Vietnamese fused with Mexican food"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, wifi, and good food! The happy hour looks really good. I'll definitely have to drop in for that."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday evening around 6:30 and I was the only customer in the restaurant. I expected more.  The girl at the register offered no help at all. Took my order and I paid.  Never mentioned that the drinks were self service.  Waiting until she brought my food over and then she proceeded to tell me where everything was located.  I ordered the fried spring rolls which were \"meh\" not anything memorable.  The main dish I had was the Burrito Phorritto. It was quite a bit of food, but nothing about it was PHO.  It was cool to go their just to say their name, Pho King, but I wouldn't go back.  If you're looking for traditional Vietnamese food, steer clear from here."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the PK food truck. I live next to their store front location and have had great experiences with food and value. 

We ordered the chicken stir fry which was, without exaggeration, 1/5 the size of their normal portions and had only 5 very small pieces of chicken. 

I expressed my concern to cashier and he pretty much told me that they reduced portion size for event and got upset with me and shaking his head at me, in front of other customers, as if I was an idiot expecting a decent amount of quality food for my money. 

He told me to deal with it and offered no solution. I then asked for owner and the owner came out of truck. 

He unapologetically handles the situation and started expressing how expensive it cost him to have truck at event and needed to cut portions and value because profits were low and he did not apologize for his employees rudeness or unprofessionalism. 

I let him know that they now lost a loyal customer at their store front location as well. 

This horrible attitude doesn't surprise me coming from employees, but the owner's was just as bad. 

I highly suggest you look at other food truck options that won't charge you full price for half of a child size portion."}
{"text":"My lady and I went for the first time yesterday (Taco Tuesday), and could not have been more impressed.  2 tacos and a beer for $10  is a no brainer.  I had 1 brisket and 1 pork taco and the IPA.  Good sized tacos, the meat was awesome and each topped with colorful fresh veggies.  The plantain chips were a unique and wonderful option as well.  Better yet they offer a full bar and daily specials.  Thank god we can walk there.  See you on Thursday Pho King."}
{"text":"This was one of those hipster trendy places that make pho cool. Or shall I say hot? ;) ok bad joke. But I ordered \"The American\", super good- it's basically beef pho. It was $10 though, which is fine but I'm used to paying cheaper than 6 dollars for pho. Also, I feel like pho is known for how cheap it is and how big portions you get. 

The food was really tasty.  There is a little self serve pho bar, where you get your sides like sauce, limes, bamboo, greens, etc. I like how the restaurant has their own variety of sauces to add to your pho. I did also notice that the soup didn't come with that much noodles. There was a lot of beef though! Which is a plus. The proportions didn't really even out. 

4 stars for the food and friendly customer service. Minus one star because of the price. 
I think all genuine pho lovers can agree with me though, pho is usually cheap!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give it a 3 due to the girl at the counter who was a sweetheart. The broth was ok at best and they're very stingy about their noodles which are off brand - yes it matters, and the Hoison sauce is off brand as well. That actually matters. Chicken is too thick. The name is super cool though. That's why I tried it."}
{"text":"Delicious food that only gets better with their house sauces (I personally recommend their BBQ, but the Dank Herb sauce is good too). I've tried a decent amount of their menu and highly recommend their Banh Mi Burrito. Anything with their brisket is fantastic as well.

The only reason this is four stars and not five is because the bar is a pretty tight squeeze. I'm hoping that they get enough business to move into a location that allows them to meet their full potential."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this Pho King Kitchen while on my way home from Scottsdale one evening to pick up some takeout for my wife and I.    We love kitschy places like this, and Pho King didn't disappoint!   I mean, the interior is all artsy hip hop with a great playlist on the sound system, there's a Pho King help yourself sauce bar in there with like a million delicious house made sauces to dip in or smother with, it shares a building with a Pho King dry cleaning place, and the Pho King food truck is parked out back.  How can you go wrong?  While I love that in the drink prices, \"Full Bar\" is listed as \"PRICELESS\", I simply had myself a reasonably priced beer while I waited, then took our massive Pho King order home.  Once I warmed it all back up a little, we dug in and very much Pho King enjoyed the following:

Sriracha Buffalo Chicken Dumplings @ $7 for an order of 6.    Full of flavor, not a bad price!

The Kamakaze Cowboy @ $11 for a pretty hearty sammy.  Take some house brisket and pair it with Tennessee-Asian BBQ sauce and a bunch of yummy toppings and call it good!   Delicious.

Lemongrass Curry Coconut Shrimp Pho @ $10 for a full order.   Awesome flavor, wife loves Pho and she loved the broth.  

Bandido Chicken Tacos @ $10 for 3.   Robust little tacos with some great toppings.   

All, in this was about $60 including my beer and tip, but we had so much leftover that we got an entire Pho King 2nd meal out of it.   And don't forget to load up on to-go cups of all the sauces if you're doing takeout!  

This place is worth checking out.  The food was awesome."}
{"text":"Placed a phone order and was told 20 minutes for two orders of stir fry with shrimp. Nearly 50 minutes and some complaints later and I'm walking out with my order. Was given a couple of $2 off coupons for my trouble. Food was good, but nothing special. I've picked up 4-5 times and it's always slow with barely any customers. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Love love love the ginger pork dumplings! The Pho wasn't very flavorful, but they have tons of toppings and sauces to add to make it your own!"}
{"text":"Sooo awesome! My boyfriend's mother is Korean and he grew up eating a lot of Korean inspired dishes with American twists.. Like Gimbap (Korean style sushi/rice rolls) with hotdog inside. So we figured this place would be right up our alleys. And it is! We both ordered burrito Phoritto, one with brisket and one with pork, and an order or dumplings to share. The tortillas are perfectly chewy, the rice was sticky and we were both shocked that the kimchi was actually kimchi and not just wilted cabbage. The dumplings were perfect, soft insides and crispy edges. And their sauce bar was bomb... house made siracha, some awesome sweet herb sauce! We will be back and bringing friends! My boyfriend can't wait to take his mom here :)"}
{"text":"We love this place, it's a casual neighborhood restaurant. I almost always order the 'American Pho' and a side of ginger pork dumplings. We've also tried the tacos and they didn't disappoint. The Pho isn't a traditional Vietnamese Pho but I don't think they're advertising it as that. It's more of a fusion dish with rich flavors and a generous helping of noodles, bean sprouts, basil, and jalapeños. Personally, I love their Pho and I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Seriously Terrible. Decided to give them another try cause I'm lazy and it's available on uber eats. With that being said got the traditional pho, the broth this time tasted bland and watery. No basil or cilantro in the veggies and the noodles were already over cooked. No hoisin, no Siracha, or chop sticks. Seriously want my money back"}
{"text":"Great local place for protein, veggies, noodles, pho and shrimp! They always go way above and beyond and the atmosphere is always friendly. I love the the noodles, veggies and shrimp! Mike always makes the place run awesome!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for a while now.  I was at work and placed an order with UberEATS to have it delivered.  First of all, it took 45 minutes for my food to be prepared, soup and a sandwich, that was a bit long.  Second, the Pho tasted like it was mostly made from beef bullion cubes, I was so disappointed.  It was insanely salty and I couldn't taste any of the normal flavors you expect from Pho.  The bahn mi was ok, not served on a baguette like normal, the flavor was good, but lacking something as well... sadly, I don't plan to go back.  
I hope they will use this review as constructive criticism and do better."}
{"text":"Pho has to literally be my most favorite thing to eat in this world besides sushi! That's why I'm so mad at myself that I noticed I never posted my review when going through my photos. Pho King came to my work for our food truck Wednesday and to say I was excited is an understatement lol. After talking to the awesome girl working the window I decided on the Pork Pho. It came will all my favorite fixings and I also ordered a side appetizer. AMAZING! I wish I lived closer to this side of town to stop by their restaurant as well. Hopefully we'll venture over soon so my hubby can give it a try."}
{"text":"Love it! Great Pho, great service (from the Chef), and a really fun, lively atmosphere. We'll be back to try the other, more unique, menu options VERY soon! (Banh Mi Burrito, Burrito Phorrito, and the noodle bowl)"}
{"text":"Our buddy Derek first introduced used to Pho in Vegas. We loved it and this was my first attempt back home in Scottsdale. I did take out. The restaurant is nothing fancy but their food is amazing. This place for sure is on my list of food pick up after a long day after work. If you Phoking hungry this will make your tummy happy. Wish I had a picture but I ate it all up before I thought about it"}
{"text":"We just moved in down the street and I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that there is an awesome pho place right up the street!! My bf and I went in last night mid rain storm (the perfect time for pho), and we were quite impressed! We ordered the sriacha and the sesame wontons, both are a must try!! My bf had the chicken stir fry which he said was awesome! And I had the pho of course. It was so flavorful and so fresh. We had no idea that they had a full bar too. It is a really cool place to go and hang out. Our bartender, unfortunately I can't remember his name, was awesome as well! We will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place has the grossest pho I've ever had. It was $14.95 for pho and the meat was disgusting!! The meat I can't even describe, they at least shouldn't charge out the butt for it. I was disappointed with what I got for what I paid for. I do not recommend this place. The lady on the phone had no idea what she was talking about either."}
{"text":"I've been here many times now and I have fallen in love with their brisket tacos and dank sauce (they have a great condiment bar). Do yourself a favor and try their tacos, they're amazing! I haven't really tried anything else here because I can't bring myself to order anything besides the tacos, but other people I've recommended this place to have liked everything they've had here. The service is also excellent."}
{"text":"The food was above average but I have to give it a 1 star due to not giving me the 20% coupon for their check in.

First, I can understand not giving it for delivery through a 3rd party company like GrubHub or postmates as you can't control that but for regular take out customers? I was physically in the restaurant picking up the food.

I mean, C'mon. What's the difference between $20 I spend eating there or $20 I spend and eat my food at home. Revenue is revenue. IMO, that's bad practice as you're proving to me that you actually have favoritism when it comes to your customers. I mean you literally did nothing different between me eating there or the comfort of my own home so I can watch football. 

This was my first time there but given that I may try another Pho establishment nearby instead. Like I said, the food was good but now I have a reason to seek another place. The lady at the front was nice about it btw and it's not her fault."}
{"text":"Mexican/Vietnamese/90's hip-hop fusion. When your level of kitsch is that refined (and you don't charge street food prices), the food better be worth it. It is.

I was feeling in the mood for some straight Vietnamese, so I ordered the lemongrass curry coconut shrimp. SO good. Highly recommend. That and a side of spring rolls and you're set. The fact that you CAN leave room for local craft beer means, again, that they take the craft seriously. The atmosphere is the exact opposite -- laid back to a fault, with a four-seat dive bar in the corner (still not sure why), and wearable merch with PHO KING printed on everything.

I have to believe a restaurant like this isn't for everybody. But for someone who consumed enough 90's hip-hop and good Vietnamese food in high school to last ... a while ... Pho King hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is nice casual dining. The service is always great. Shout out to 'Daniel' for super service.

The food is awesome using fresh ingredients. 

Nice patio outside and even a nice bar area inside.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Soooo bomb!!! The Hippie the coconut curry and the American are my favorite the small is plenty big super tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed - the Pho was cold and the meat was tough. I paid $3.50 extra because I wanted to sub all rare beef instead of brisket. I received less meat in my soup than normal. If I am paying $3.50 extra I expect a decent amount of food. Not impressed with this place anymore."}
{"text":"some of the best pho and the freedom of the menu to get exactly what you want"}
{"text":"Ordered some potstickers and American Pho. I thought it was delicious and received good service. I have always ordered to go though. Their potstickers are fresh everytime i ordered and I actually like their broth+noodles. Although the beef was overcooked."}
{"text":"Tried the infamous pho-rrito burrito. The Pho King Kitchen & Food Truck just opened its restaurant here in south Scottsdale. What more can you ask if you want your pho bowl wrapped into one as a burrito. I got it with chicken, and it was good next time I'll probably get it with pork! It's menu has different varieties, and they even have pho, And noodle entrees.

{"text":"The inside was surprisingly bigger than what it looks on the outside, very chill and artsy ambiance.The beer selection sounded great. And the food didn't disappoint! I had the half size American pho and the Phorito burrito with Ginger pork. I loved that the pho broth wasn't too salty. It was a good ratio of noodles and meat. The burrito was unique in flavor and satisfying. The dank herb sauce was outstanding on the burrito. 
The service was good and fast (although, it wasn't busy). All around really great flavors!"}
{"text":"This is for the restaurant, not food truck.

I was going to give three stars but the owner took the time to ask how the food was and if I had any suggestions. Extra star just for that. Walking in I didn't know this was an Asian fusion restaurant.

Ordered pho with brisket and the spring rolls with chicken. The pho was just ok, I think the noodles were way overcooked, really they should be softened but still a bit chewy. The broth was ok also, wasn't too salty, but wasn't popping with any flavor either. I've certainly had worse at \"real\" Vietnamese restaurants. I usually order the pho tai (thinly sliced beef) and was a little disappointed that I had to get brisket, turns out there were both in the dish. The thinly sliced beef was great (owner said they cook to order and if I wanted that in the future I could get it). The brisket was a little fatty, but brisket is by nature, there was a nice crust on a few of the pieces, honestly I liked it more than I thought I would.

The spring rolls....I think someone needs to work on their wrapping skills! All the ingredients were fresh and the peanut sauce was good enough, but the rolls were falling apart before I even picked one up. The pulled chicken actually made the roll really dry, next time I would get the pork filling.

The restaurant itself is awesome, gorgeous patio out front and full bar, nice colors throughout and just a good vibe to the place. Having the owner show interest in the customers thoughts is refreshing. He mentioned they've only been open a little over a month so it's kind of a work in progress. Also mentioned that what was popular on the food truck is the exact opposite for the restaurant, which they're still trying to get worked out.

I'll certainly go back, I didn't see the hours but seems like a cool place to hang out at night with the bar and patio. The tacos and burritos (phorritos) certainly seem innovative, might try next time. Tho the pho! All I could humbly suggest is to try some of the other highly rated pho joints around (khai hoan in tempe - best pho and spring rolls/egg rolls in the east valley), deconstruct and maybe ask the staff for pointers (the son that usually takes your order there is really nice).

If Pho King could offer a bomb bowl of pho and their other fusion dishes I'd be in like flynn. And if there gets to be a good night life there with the bar maybe offer some tapas or small fusion apps to go with the drinks.

You guys are definitely on to something, appreciate it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just went to the Kitchen for the first time. We have loved the truck and we're extremely stoked when the kitchen open walking distance from our house. We walked in and we're greeted by the nice girl behind the counter. As we look over the menue, my girlfriend noticed that the Veggie both that she has enjoyed in the past was not on the menu. We asked the girl if they had it, she proceeded to walk over and ask cook. The cook replied with a disgusted dickish face and tone, \"uh NO!\" We were in shock by this astronomically horrible response. That we emiditly left. We will never be going back as it is so disrespectful to treat someone with food allergies in such a way. Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I hated pho before coming here. I will only get pho from here. It's the best. Do your self a favor and try it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negative reviews! I am not usually one to leave reviews, but they have earned it! Being in the old town area, it is hard to compete and excel in the restaurant business! Pho King has risen to the challenge! While not a traditional Pho joint, they have put a unique twist on the Asian fusion game. Their pho alone is delicious! I have not quite tried them all, but I like everything I've had so far! Their sandwiches are fantastic as well! I recommend the Kamikaze Cowboy! The Brisket is perfect! The sauces... oh the sauces... there are so many to choose from and all of them are insanely delicious! I really have nothing bad to say about this restaurant, the staff has always been very laid back but also very helpful! Pho King is quickly becoming my go to carry out spot! Pho King delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly, such a disappointment and waste of time and money. The service was bad and the food was worse. I should have known this pho was going to be bad, and nowhere close to being authentic since there wasn't any Vietnamese people in sight. It was incredibly overpriced and I wouldn't pay a single dollar to eat there again. As if having bland food wasn't bad enough, the service made me want to shoot myself. They ran out of spoons...at a pho restaurant.  like seriously? Go wash a spoon! They just looked at me like sorry, share a spoon with your husband. Everyone just looked blazed out of their minds or something. Worst experience EVER."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ... Love the stir fry not a big fan of pho but maybe another time I suppose I might have the acquired taste for pho ... Not even sure what it is... .um yeah so that's that"}
{"text":"Fantastic!   It is a hidden place in not the ideal location..... But don't let that fool you.  Energetic and engaging staff!  The food is so amazing that it made me want to eat a special brownie to eat more!  Five stars all the way around!!   Haven't tried the Pho but going back this week!"}
{"text":"Their veggie pho is very good! My boyfriend and I visited about a week ago and were pleasantly surprised about their \"dank herb\" sauce; so good!!! A tad more expensive than other places, but it's a good place to try out and give it a go. There is a bar where you can gather your own bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño, as well as limes and other sauces to try."}
{"text":"Now, I am no Pho expert; but I wasn't feeling well today and I have always heard that Pho can fix anything... so I ordered some American Pho and can I just say, it hit the SPOT. Simple, delicious, exactly what I was looking for... and the best part - it's right around the corner from work. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe we waited over a year to try this place.  First of all, it's in my neighborhood.  I was under the impression all they served was Pho.  It's a fusion that offers burritos, and sandwiches, with asian flare.  The entrance is busy due to the placement of the business, however, they have a parking lot in the back.  It's a very colorful restaurant, they have a bar and nice size dining area.  We ordered at the counter.  First thing you notice is their fountain drink dispenser isn't your normal standard soda options.  It's made with natural ingredients, pure cane sugar and no artificial coloring.  I loved them all!!  My favorite was the hibiscus orange soda.  Wow!!  I ordered a half Lemongrass Curry Coconut shrimp  Pho.  The broth was so delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfect.  I also ordered a Kamikaze Cowboy melt. The brisket was so tender and I loved the flavor of the BBQ sauce.  The flatbread is very good and stands up to the melted ingredients. The house made chips were pretty good.  I can't wait to go back and try their other menu items.  They also have a full bar that offers Happy hour and a break on appetizers from 4-6.  Next I would like to try their handmade dumplings.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Good service.. the girls at the till were amazing and the pho was good I would definitely come back again.. the broth of the pho was on point... you have found your self a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Being able to talk to the owners and found that they have a very innovative mindset and love bold flavors. Form their menu and from tasting their dishes, they love to experiment and they really love bold flavors. They told me they inherited an old rotating pizza oven where they braise their meat for hours making their meat have the right amount of crunch and the right amount of soft, gelatinously flavor.

I tried 4 dishes while there. The standard pho, one of the Asian fusion burritos, their plantain chips, and while chatting with the owner, convinced him to have me try one of his awesome tacos.

Here's a description of what I ate.

Pho with Pork - In Northern California, I've noticed that no matter where I go, all of the pho tastes the same. It's like there's a standard idea of what pho is and the Vietnamese mafia controls it.  Outside of very Asian dense populations, pho starts to variate and it becomes either decent, or horrible. I know, it's blasphemous to put any protein besides beef in pho but this isn't supposed to be authentic, I told them what was the best combo to get and this was my response.

Pho King has good pho but it is not like regular Vietnamese pho and that's ok. I feel the broth is a bit thicker and richer but the drawback is that it's a bit salty in my taste. I guess you can say you get more bang for your buck for the soup. Other than that, this is a hearty bowl of noodles. The little greens they serve have thai basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime and a new garnish I've never seen before: red cabbage. However, the cabbage actually gives the final dish a very nice purple color and contrasts very well with the green, brown and white.

Burrito Phorrito- This restaurant has two burritos that are based off of popular Vietnamese dishes: Banh Mi and Phorrito. I took the latter which involves stir fried vegetables, pickled vegetables, melted cheese, your meat of choice (I chose brisket) and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla. This was a very satisfying burrito and you get all sorts of crazy flavors (sour, salty, meaty, umami, pickled, refreshing) and texture (cheesy, fork-tender, rustic, fatty,) combinations. I noticed that the burrito has yellow pickled cauliflower. This stuff reminds me a lot of daikon radishes, which adds another layer of complexity to the burrito.

My only suggestion I would suggest in this burrito is cut the meat smaller as I got really big chunks in mine and I feel it would be more beneficial cutting it into cubes.

Plantains with Spicy Mango Sauce - Deep fried plantain chips served with a spicy mango sauce. To be honest, eating them separately was alright, but when you combine the two, the flavors mesh extremely well. Again, you have such contrasting textures and flavors between the crunchy, sweet plantains and the spicy, sweet and creamy mango sauce. These are a great party snack appetizers to buy for your table and the presentation's pretty nice. It's in a nice little queso dish.

Taco with Pork shoulder and pickled green apple toppings - After conversing with the owner for a little bit, I told him about this blog, and how I'm really in to food. He went into the kitchen and pulled out a glorious taco for me to try. The great thing about tacos is that good ones are simple and you can really appreciate the flavors when it comes to eating a taco. The meat had a perfectly seasoned crunch and soft, tender flesh and the pickeled apples on top complements the pork (the old combo pork chops and apples sauce resonated here). 

If you like the food truck, you'll love the brick-and-mortar because they have all of your favorite foods, better silverware, free water and of course, alcohol (not free).

I find the items on the menu very creative and very bold in flavor. If you're adventurous and love Asian fusion food, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"4 stars because someone finally did it: named a Vietnamese(ish) place Pho King.

It's stir fry Friday, so I got beef brisket stir fry. It was very good and decent, not mind blowing. It came with a beer, which was a Bad Panda Ginger Pale Ale. Good for a hot Phoenix summer Friday lunch.

I will probably stop back in here again and try the pho and bahn mi."}
{"text":"I'm sad that I just found this place and I'm moving out of state tomorrow! Cool vibe and great food, don't miss out like I did."}
{"text":"Affordable and fast! I ordered the curry pho and loved it! Parking is in the back , It can be confusing. Can't wait to go back. Girl who took my order over the phone was very helpful and kind."}
{"text":"We found this place by driving by it all the time and then we found a groupon for it. So we decided to give it a try.

It is definitely not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It was very Americanized..

Their soups and burritos do not come with protein [meat]. 

I decided to try to Banh mi burrito with chicken. Surprisingly, it wasn't was I expected. It had so many different flavors that you think wouldn't be in a burrito. It was more on the lighter, vege side then a heavy filling burrito that you normally expect.

The only thing I would have liked more if there was more chicken in the burrito. I only tasted a few bites in it."}
{"text":"This is a hipster place, not a traditional pho place. I was expecting normal pho, based on the name of toys place. The pho was terrible, the broth smelled and tasted  like cinnamon which was weird. The service was good though."}
{"text":"I have a mild addiction to the tempura tofu stir fry.  Great place to grab a bite as a vegetarian!   The actual restaurant has a very chill atmosphere and vibe if you are dining in.  They let me hang my art here too, love that they support local artists!"}
{"text":"Eh... The first time we tried this place, we were given our Pho with NO veggies on the side. No basil, sprouts, cilantro, or lime... We just rolled with it and figured it was a bust. Upon receiving my reciept via square, it asked for feedback. I left some and told them that the spot was dope and that I was stoked to have it literally right across the street from me, but that they should serve the Pho with the traditional fare. 

 Surprisingly... one of the owners messaged me and said that the traditional ingredients are supposed to come with the Pho, but that someone must have messed up. The place had only been open for a couple weeks... no harm, no foul. He insisted that we come back in and have a couple orders of the vast array of pot stickers that are on the menu, free of charge. I don't write a lot of reviews and I am no food critic.. I don't have unreasonable expectations, and I don't get upset easily. I wasn't upset at all really. However, he was insistent and this is literally in my back yard, so with it being a new neighborhood establishment.. I decided to take him up on the offer. My lady and I walked over to the spot and tried to get in on the offer that was given to us, only to be told that they were \"out of potstickers\"... So That left me wondering how fresh the food being prepared exactly is... When you run out, do you not just make more? This is not a food truck... this is a freestanding establishment in the neighborhood that I live in. This didn't make much sense to me, and it still doesn't. Since they had NO potstickers, I tried to order and pay for the Plaintain chips... they were out of them too... 

 I was kinda pissed and just wanted to leave but bit the bullet and ordered Pho... our bowls were served up to the window AGAIN, with no traditional sides... I had to ask for them because I wasn't going to stay silent this time. If this place would get it's ish together, then I would literally eat there weekly as it's directly across from my apartment but I can't give money to an overpriced Pho spot for hipsters if I can't count on the food being good, or even being available. They have Hip Hop shows there now and that's dope... but I'm not interested in your place being a nightclub with that tiny bar... I'm interested in your food, which you don't have any of. Word up.. I guess...."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place besides the fact that it's Pho King terrible. 

Came in last night for the first time ever. Ordered the traditional pho and some potstickers. This is the first time in my life I wanted to walk into a kitchen and dump out their pot full of garbage \"broth\". Noodles hard enough that you can use them as chopsticks. 4 and a half total pieces of meat that are as tough as getting your favorite hoodie back from your ex. Don't get me started on their house \"sriracha\".

This place has taken my favorite dish and have Pho King ruined it. Instead of being called Pho King, it should be called Pho Servant because this is definitely not a king of anything. 

If you're looking for sewer water pho, then this is for Pho King place!"}
{"text":"The Pho was bland, I've had deliciously and amazing Pho and it didn't quite meet expectations. The meatballs look like tofu, and it's definitely not fresh meat they are using. The Pho is like a microwave version, something that they ordered in a can and heated up."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and yummy experience! Good food right temp tasty! Young lady at counter very sweet and patient. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Pho ever! I love The Traditional. Every time the flavor is great and the meat is cooked perfectly. I've only ever had Pho King delivered on postmates so I can't comment on the actual restaurant itself, but I would definitely come check it out! Never disappointed in the quality of food."}
{"text":"Shhhhhh! Don't tell anybody or this place will be packed 7 days a week & there will be a line out the door. The menu is pretty simple but there's enough options to make anyone happy. Food is fresh & flavorful. Prices are super reasonable and portions very generous."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is fun but my food was not very good. The pho broth is weak and not very flavorful. It also wasn't very hot when it came out, which was weird. My egg rolls were not tally seasoned and the sauce did help. The egg rolls were over cooked and dry/rubbery. I'm giving it a 2 though because it was editable just not enjoyable.

Good things about this place: staff was nice and place was clean. Also; I like the decor and the fact that they have a bar. That being said, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I am beyond happy, you could say THRILLED, that I found this place. Oh Em Gee! I ordered the lemongrass coconut curry shrimp Pho, shrimp spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce, and salted edamame Togo through Uber Eats even though I'm right down the street, suuuuuuper hungover. It arrived within a half hour and was still hot. And phoking deeeeeliiicious as phooooock! I was worried the lemongrass would be too overwhelming, it's not! Goodness gracious, the flavor was out of this world. SO good, people! Spring rolls were dank. Extra fresh. Like SUPER fresh. The freshest. Edamame was perfectly steamed, very edamame-y. Lovely food. Just lovely. I am stoked to go back and get the phorito burrito, tacos. Or anything else. I only wish they had wings because I KNOW they would do 'em right. Oh man. What are you waiting for? Tryyyyyy it!"}
{"text":"Far from the King of PHO. Ordered the medicine man from Amazon. Not much flavor or Chicken, all dark meat as well. No sauce was included and there was ONE basil LEAF. Far from impressed. Worst pho in Phoenix"}
{"text":"\"Americanized\" Asian food; They have a good vegetarian/vegan menu selection, the vegetarian pot stickers were good with a delicious sauce. They even have vegetarian pho that I will try next time."}
{"text":"nice job...needs the curry,they have nice condiments to add... booze prices out of line so takes the fun out of it ..."}
{"text":"We got a groupon and couldn't wait to try this place. We shared an order of the handmade dumplings; he had sriracha chicken and pork, I had the vegetarian. When they came out we asked which were vegetarian and the server didn't know so he had the chef make me three more. Wouldn't order dumplings again though. I had a shrimp taco and the tempura tofu taco (liked it best). The kimchi and pickled veggies on top were super yummy. He had their take on a cheesesteak sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed. Over all consensus: good food but the drink prices are too expensive to lure us in as a drinking hole"}
{"text":"Last week, we decided to try Pho King for the first time. I'd never had Pho before and have heard all the rave about it so I was really excited to try it. We walked in at 9:10 pm and greeted by the man behind the counter with \"just so you know, we are closing in 20 minutes.\" Not a great start. We placed our order and asked if it was okay to stay to eat, he said it was. 

After ordering our food, I went back to the counter to order some drinks and told the man that their website says they close at 10:30 on Fridays and midway through telling him, he said: \"the website is wrong.\" What?! I told him I wouldn't have come if I knew they were closing in 20 minutes and as I said that, there were about 3 other parties walking in. I said, \"they probably think you're closing at 10:30, too, that's why they are coming in.\" He just looked at me blankly. I could tell he was in a hurry to get out of work but the older man, who was cleaning the entire time we were there didn't seem to mind. 

Never having had pho before, I can't really judge the food. Maybe I just don't like pho but the broth was bland and not as interesting as what has been described to me. I don't think I'll go back, but their other dishes (sandwiches and wraps) looked interesting. After the poor welcome and rudeness of the man taking our order, I'd rather not inconvenience him to try anything else."}
{"text":"\"Never again!\" - those are the words I angrily uttered after opening our package of food from UberEats.  I gave this place 2 stars as opposed to 1 star, because part of the MAJOR disappointment in the meal was due to my careless reading of their menu in the UberEats app.  The description for pho said \"a huge bowl of rich beef pho broth served with rice noodles... blah blah\"  Well, dumb me I was not understanding that this pho comes with no meat at all - I just assumed that like typical pho it came with slices of raw beef.  At no other Vietnamese restaurant will you get pho that is just plain broth with noodles.  So I paid $8 for broth and a teeny bit of rice noodles and the garnishings (mint, bean sprouts, lime, hot pepper).  On top of that, the dang pho broth didn't even taste that good!  I have a feeling that even if I had selected the additional add-on of $3 for smoked brisket, I would have still been disappointed.

Siggghhh.  

The garden rolls (springs rolls) were slightly better, but only slightly.  The cabbage they put in there was too bitter - those rolls are not typically made with red cabbage, and now I can see why.  It's like this restaurant is updating traditional Vietnamese food just for the sake of innovation and being \"modern\" without stopping to consider whether it's even an improvement in taste over the traditional way.  Also, on the service side they gave 2 options of peanut sauce or sweet chili sauce. I selected peanut sauce, so of course what came in my order? You guessed it, sweet chili sauce!

I'm sad because this is one of the few options on UberEats. oh well, now I know!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a good experience.


$11 for \"Traditional pho\"...
Please go to a traditional pho shop and compare what you get from them vs what you get here at Pho King.

I really like their set-up. It's a dope hipster spot, but if your service is mainly to serve food. Please serve good food.

The pho:
You get broth that doesn't taste traditional. You have to have deep flavor in the broth. The noodles are the correct noodles but the meat to broth and noodle ratio is very sad. You don't get a lot of meat and you miss out on the real traditional meats.

To sum it up. For my pho and tip $14 (you pay and tip first before any food is made...) you get a watered down version of Pho. 

All this place has to do to progress is to hire a Vietnamese chef with real experience. One that will be there at 4:30 am to start prepping the real broth. One who shops for all the meats that really come in real Pho. Real pho doesn't come out like this. It's a disrespect to the culture and to people who pay such a premium price for such a watered down version. 

This experience was like going to Jack n the Box and ordering their tacos to get authentic Mexican Food. Traditional pho?... Not even in the same league. 

I wouldn't order again for $3. I'm back to my $8 spot in Mesa. This was just another learning experience while trying to support local businesses. 

2 stars vs 1 BC the layout is really dope. They just need to get the food right."}
{"text":"I love Pho a King! I get the Vegan Pho and love the tastes in the broth. The tofu is delightful. Take a chance on this cool, hippy place. You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Worst Pho!  I left my number for manager to call me and he never did.  Service was bad..food was bad.  Took one bite and sent the whole meal back!  Don't go there...only went there because  my favorite Pho place was closed."}
{"text":"I was leery about this place because I'm used to the old school, hole-in-the-wall pho places.  I've tried their food truck when they came to my work place and was impressed.  So we were in the area the following week and decided to try out their brick and mortar location.  The building is connected to a laundromat.  The pho was good.  The service almost non-existent. It's pricier than what I am used to but the food was decent."}
