{"text":"Lloyd's Patties are always fresh and fabulous! You can buy patties one at a time (not sure why you would though), or by the dozen or the case (24). They freeze well, but are so delicious you may not get a chance to try that. Best ones are the Spicy Beef, but Chicken or Vegetable are also good if you are not into eating beef. If spicy is not what you like, the regular ones are very tasty as well.  I am not sure how long he has been at this new location, but this was the first time I have been to it - easy to get to, although the parking lot is small and was very busy the day I was there. Regardless, it is worth finding, and waiting for a parking space, or even walking from another parking lot across the street.   Already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since elementary school, their spicy beef patties have always been fresh and tasty.  Plus $2 for a beef patty is ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"Well considering that I've been eating them for over 20 years - even before the new location when he ran Caribbean Bakery way back when off Memorial!   JBP's just rock and ya gotta buy em by the case!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected at all. If you are looking for a dine-in experience, forget it. If you are after amazing food to take away, you are going to be  blown away. Spicy beef patty and jerky chicken meal on Saturdays - absolutely incredible. The patty is amazing, but enjoy cautiously as the meat filling is boiling - lava hot! Flavour is indescribable! Just shut up and eat! The jerk chicken meal is not elegantly served, but the take away box is loaded with chicken, rice and bean, and  mixed greens. The jerk is not overly spicy, but you will savour every morsel!  Buy bulk to take away for the freezer! Jerk chicken by the pound or patties by the dozen. Inexpensive and awesome!"}
{"text":"Love their spicy beef Jamaican patties!! Stumbled upon this little shop and could've believe we found a place that sells these. My boyfriend tried Jamaican patties for the first time and he loved it. You can order frozen ones in bulk as well!"}
{"text":"What I really like is the oxtail.  I grew up on West Indian foods but my stomach can no longer handle such items as jerk chicken.  You just can't beat their oxtails but you really have to call and order in advance.  Seems as though they sell out of this item more than anything else."}
{"text":"This place by far has the BEST jamaican patties and jerk chicken in town. Patties are piping hot (you can buy frozen as well) and the pastry is super flaky. This have a Friday and Saturday jamaican jerk chicken but you gotta get here early as they sell out fast. You get a huge amount of chicken, rice and salad for $13.95. You can easily share it with someone or split it up into 3 meals. The sauce they have for the chicken is really spicy so I only dip the chicken in slightly   The only down side is the service is extremely slow.  You are waiting in line for a good 20-30 min before they serve you but be patient.  Its a mom and pop shop. Not sure what they do in the back that takes so long"}
{"text":"Where to start... I've been going to Lloyd's for about 22 years now. His place was once situated on the corner if Memorial drive and 36th st.  They are the best patties in Calgary. Fresh patties are a must...splitting one open, the aroma of the spices just can't be beat. The piping hot beef inside and the crispy pastry that surrounds. Anyone that have not tried a fresh patty, go now!"}
{"text":"Patties are great, flaky crust and flavorful filling.  I've had all the variations.  I thought the spicy beef would have a bit more bite but they tasted great and a shot of hot sauce finished them up just fine.  Price is great too.  Just be aware this isn't really a dine in spot.  You can have your patties hot for eating right away or cold for take away and heating later.  Another big plus any of the staff I've met when going here have always been great and friendly."}
{"text":"Llyod's patty plus has the best Jamaican food in the city. The jerk chicken will make your tastebuds dance, pair it with some rice and peas and you can't get any more satisfied. They are the real deal, serving oxtail and other carribean favourites. The patties and meatloaf are baked to perfection. They also take orders for cocktail patties which are great for sharing...or not:)"}
{"text":"I grew up in the very multicultural city of Toronto, so have had many Jamaican patties in my day.  I know what I like in a patty and these are okay, but not quite a match - the filling is a bit sparse and liquidy. I only eat chicken so can speak only for those. It is a matter of personal preference. I would not dissuade one from trying these patties and determining if they are the Jamaican patty for you. They are reasonably priced and discounted in larger quantities."}
{"text":"Although I'm a strict vegetarian, my Dad LOOOOVES Jamaican patties. It's a known fact that the best Jamaican patties in Calgary are Lloyd's. Even Safeway and other grocery stores around town carry Lloyd's delicious goods.  I went over to Lloyd's last week to pick up some patties for my Dad. The man at the counter (i'm not sure if it was ACTUALLY Lloyd or not, but I'm going to pretend it was) was SO wonderful! He was friendly, sweet, and gave me a great deal!  I bought a dozen patties and got them for just under $2/piece, which is CHEAP!  Plus the best part is that, Lloyd told me exactly how to bake them so they would be PERFECT every time.  I got two words: YA MAN!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, good flavour. The oxtail meal lasted me 2 lunches and a dinner. Get extra sauce!"}
{"text":"This place has better Jamaican patties than the ones in Jamaica! It is true. The spicy beef and chicken are both delicious! I love this place very much. Jamaican me happy lloyds !"}
{"text":"I'd give them between a 2.5 star if I could.  I have bought all three assortments a few times and in my opinion the beef patties are the only ones worth purchasing.  The chicken are way too pasty. The veggie patties are terrible because there is no love in them - this is not the Jamaican way.  They put a tablespoon of frozen mixed vegetables in the centre with absolutely no flavouring added not even salt. The veggie patties I had in Jamaica were dynamite - collard greens loaded with spices. My tip is buy the beef patties and then top with \"Pick A Peppa\" sauce from Joyce's."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican Patties in town ESPECIALLY when you get them hot right out the oven.   Great light flaky crust and real spicy beef filling."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Poor customer service, waiting for eternity  for my food, then over charged me, provided no receipt so i couldn't  even prove to them they overcharged me. Their patties are alright, but be aware when buying food from here you may be stiffed! I've  been their customer  for years and the way i was treated disgusts me. This place is off my list!"}
{"text":"The Best Jamaican Beef Patties in Canada, hands down, Iv been going to Lloyd's for years, but I recently discovered that on Fridays and Saturdays they offer Jerk Chicken by the pound, grilled to perfection, and with a killer jerk sauce and also OX Tail , I haven't tried the Ox Tail but I hear great things about it. They sell out of the jerk chicken by early afternoon, so if you read this, try the chicken and don't tell too many people, it's like a secret society of chicken lovers, and the Patties come in Veggie and chicken as well as the popular beef, and they come regular, or spicy, a must try for everyone. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Patties and jerk chicken amazing. Buy the chicken by the pound for best deal $8 per pound"}
{"text":"The patties are great - beef, ckn and veg - if you like spice then I recommend ordering spicy. Be prepared to wait .. Whether there is a line or not. There def is a slower approach to service and preparation. The patties were yummy - more filling would be nice. We also tried one of the weekend specials (jerk ckn and rice). It came with a green salad as well. I would never order it again. Tasteless rice (like bad Mexican red beans and rice) the ckn had nooooo taste and the salad- well it's hard to ruin a basic salad. I would return only to have the patties again - and only if I had time to wait."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and their customer service out of this world amazing the food is great and I'm a picky eater  I got a beef and a chicken patty with the cocoa bread delicious will be going back really soon and the prices are so affordable  $2.50 for a patty"}
{"text":"Been going to lloyds for years. He used to be over by malbrough mall. Then sold and was closed for a long time. I was so happy to hear he had opened another store. Not only are the patties the best in Canada but I had the oxtail today and it was delicious. Not to spicy just perfect. Along with fresh rice peas and salad. But this is only on Fridays the also have jerk chicken. I guess I'll try that next Friday."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lloyd's for as long as I can remember growing up in the NE. They have the best patties in Calgary - hands down. The jerk chicken - served only on Fridays is amazing! Get extra sauce - you'll thank me ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific Jamaican patties, bit of a wait but well worth it. Good deals on buying in bulk too!"}
{"text":"I never venture out of my Western food bubble but when a friend from work brought me a patty from Lloyd's I was so impressed. Spicy beef Jamaican patty is the way to go, I will definitely visit again."}
