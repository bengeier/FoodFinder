{"text":"Great place... for hot and sour soup.
Garlic Chicken Wings.  Free delivery in Central Toronto."}
{"text":"Nope. Don't like it. Not good. We ordered noodles and it was basically ramen, and I ordered a chilli chicken, which didn't have any spice, was too saucy and was more sweet and sour than anything. I didn't finish my food. It was such a waste of my money. I gave the extra star because the boyfriend thought it was meh."}
{"text":"My husband an I went there for dinner on Thursday and we absolutely hated the food and the service. When noticed human hair floating in my eggdrop/mushroom soup, I didn't what to make a scene and just put it away. When waiter came to pick up the dishes and asked me why I didn't touch the soup, I silently pointed him to the hair floating there - you will never guess his answer... \"Why? It's Ok. You have hair, everyone has hair\". We just couldn't help but laugh at his answer. Anyway this was a prelude for a bad dinner, the food was so bad that we barely touched it. We paid for the food (no tip), left, and went to Subway next door for sandwiches. Here at least, we got what we paid for :-)"}
{"text":"Holy hell!!! Is there ANY decent Chinese food in Toronto? Take me back to basic, cheap US Chinese food. This place is straight putrid! Only edible item in our $40 order was the fried rice. The wontons were especially suspect. $6 for a box of greasy old triangles...some of which had a microscopic bit of \"meat???\" In them. The dipping sauce was a congealed red blob. The hot and sour soup was opaque bright orange....again lumps of congealed....something..???...in it. Could not eat. Everything else was crazy bland...including the human beef supposedly their specialty.
For real, I give up on your Chinese food Canada."}
{"text":"This place is crap!  Not that I am a Chinese food expert but I have had my share in my lifetime and this places takes the cake for dead last.  Only thing that resembled what it's supposed to taste like was the deep fried wontons.  I highly recommend you find an alternative for Chineese food."}
{"text":"THE WORST Chinese food I have ever tasted. Beef was rubbery. Veggies consisted of wilted onions. Service was awful. No idea how this place is in business."}
{"text":"I order from here when I work late. It's mostly because they deliver and it's very cheap with lots of leftovers. I would say it's pretty hit-or-miss. There are some items on the menu such as lo mien and fried garlic shrimp which are NOTHING like what you would expect. (Lo Mien was just a cooked ramen noodle and fried garlic shrimp was... mhmm not juicy jumbo shrimp)  However, I really like the Shanghai noodles (it's pretty hard to screw up) and also the Dinner for One combos are only $7 and come with rice and a main. Super convenient for nights when you just want to eat and go to bed but not if you're looking to impress guests with gourmet cooking."}
{"text":"The bbq ribs I ordered barely had any meat on them. The pork fried rice tasted very bland and hardly had any pork in them. I paid 10 bucks for the dinner special and the food I got was worth 5 bucks tops. 1 star. Would've given it 2 but the tap option didn't even work on their debit machine. Your best bet if you're in the area and want chinese food is to go elsewhere. Don't waste your money at this dump like I did."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. This was the worst Chinese take out I've ever had. I had to throw away everything nothing was edible!! Do yourself a favour and stay away"}
{"text":"Best delivery in the area....shanghai noodles are awsome and chicken fried rice, chowmeinan and wings...I love the food and delivery is very fast even tho they say 45min its more like 30 or less, 15$ min for free delivery ya there 5 star no matter what others say you get what you pay for and I am satisfied."}
{"text":"This is the dirty chinese food you are looking for. Cheap. Filthy. Just plain greasy. This is the chinese food you eat when you dont give a fuck about the world. This is the chinese food you eat when you say fuck it. This is the fucking dorty chinese food midtown has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace and I'm amazed how it's still in business. We ordered knowing that the reviews were bad but figured they were from uptight yelpers with super high standards and couldnt be that bad. You can buy better chinese food from the freezer at the grocery store. The food was barely edible and a total waste of $45. 0 stars."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for Chinese Food delivery.  They are quick, reasonably priced and the food is delicious!  They've recently re-done the restaurant but I still prefer to take out or get delivery."}
