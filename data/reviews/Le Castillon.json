{"text":"We were able to get a great booking through Expedia that included daily breakfast at Le Castillon restaurant. I was impressed with the amount of food available and the 3 to 4 areas of food stations. I am so used to hotel buffet breakfast buffets being so sparse and mediocre, that I was pleasantly surprised that there were food choices for pretty much anybody.  There is a hot station complete with bacon, eggs, omelettes, vegetables, and potatoes. There is also hot oatmeal complete with fruits, honey, maple syrup, and brown sugar. Directly across from there are your deli meats, smoked salmon, eggs, cheeses and all the savory things to make an international breakfast great. On the other side of that is a fruit station with a large selection different kind of fruits ranging from melons, to berries, to citrus, to exotic asian fruits. Let's not forget about the station where you have the juices and milk, and on the opposite end; breads, pastries, and croissants. I was able to mix and match with ease. I loved the Spicy Oatmeal (cold), which was not at all spicy, but reminded me of chai. It tasted Indian with milk and yogurt mixed in (tangy). It also had Sultanas and was absolutely delicious mixed with some fresh berries!  Service is very friendly, but very French. If you've been to France, then you know what I mean. 3 stars, due to the coffee being just 'ok'. For French-culture Montreal, I expected my coffee to be better."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that we even got a table here. In a hurry, I called and booked a table, he said be there in 20 mins.  I got there to find 3 parties already in line and the Maitre D ignoring them and running around. There were also tons of empty tables and they weren't cleared? Short staffed? Maybe, but I remember coming here in the past and it was the same. Doesn't also give the excuse not to greet the guests.  The matire D was running around trying to clear tables, while the two servers ran around the large rooms trying to clear things.  We sat down finally and extra cutlery and things I got my self.  The worst part?? The food was actually not bad! Dinner on Sat, was a buffet - $28.30 each. A couple of hot dishes, tons of dessert and lots of cold plates. There also was a bread table ( empty though)  Since we were in a hurry, we had to stuff our faces, didn't get a chance to take photos.  They really need to step up their staffing to survive. I would take a better bet at the bar.  --  Feb 15,2012 edit: After mentioning this directly to the Hilton website, the restaurant and beverage manager called me and I described the situation. He had explained to me that since the Dance Competition went late (which I was part of) all the reservations were pushed an hour later, and they had to accomodate. They clearly didn't have enough staff to regardless, and I suggested they staff accordingly next time.  Perhaps it was just this time, and they couldn't handle the volume (but this isn't the first time they had the comp. in the hotel, so shouldn't be anything new).   I've been in the past, and vaguely remember the service was no good, but I cannot comment.  I hope they seriously look into this.   He did ask me \"how can I help resolve this and make you happy\". Unfortunately, I didn't ask for anything bc I don't live in Montreal. Otherwise I would have asked for another meal there.   I'm curious to see other people's experiences here on a normal day!  --"}
{"text":"You can't bash something when you get it for free, unless it's like one of those inflatable clowns with a weighted bottom that when you hit it falls over but then bounces back up...because those are designed to be bashed so that's what you'd do even if it was free.  Sorry got distracted.  Anyway, if something is free you can't be too hard on it and I had continental breakfast at Le Castillon included with my stay at the Hilton.  I went twice and enjoyed the food and the service, and most importantly the coffee.     The continental breakfast included a cold buffet (meats, cheeses, fruit) along with oatmeal, pastries, bagels and bread.  Everything was fresh and tasty, although the bagels looked anemic because I'm used to those big honking NYC bagels.  These were the Kate Moss of bagels.  The waiters I had both days kept the coffee flowing and it was good.  Then when I was ready to leave, they brought me a to-go cup, so I could take some away with me.  Aw, thoughtful!    For breakfast, this is nice.  Especially if it's included.  I checked out the prices and as they say in Boston, this place is \"wicked expensive\" so I am not sure it's a good value, but if it's free, it's for me!"}
