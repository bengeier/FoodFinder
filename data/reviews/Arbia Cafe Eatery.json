{"text":"Nice place, pleasant decor, good food and prices. The staff (owner?) has been a little curt with me in the past and not overly friendly, whereas I've seen him be friendly with others (maybe I'm standoffish?) but generally a great place."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town, seriously. The guy is extremely courteous and really takes interest in what his customer likes. Puts in a good effort in his stuff and ensures perfect delivery.

This place is worthy of a lot more business and so the community here should support this. Great tasting and inexpensive pizza experience."}
{"text":"Tucked behind the print shop at 113 Bond Street is a wonderful and bright little Italian cafe, Arbia.   I visited for the first time today and had, on the recommendation of the owner, butternut squash soup (excellent and smooth tasting), and a meat and veggie pizza.   The pizza is fresh and a generous serving.  Prices are excellent value and the food is great quality.  Has only been open a few weeks, but will surely do well with the student and faculty crowd at Ryerson.    The owner has completely renovated the space and it looks welcoming and warm.   Drop in if you're in the Yonge / Dundas area or happen to be around Ryerson University."}
{"text":"Arbia Cafe is a great option for lunch in the area. The food is fast, fresh, affordable, vegetarian friendly, and good! This basement space has been renovated and feels brighter and more welcoming than before. Everyday they have a different pasta salad and panini special, and the portions are great for the price. They also have green salads, fresh baked cookies and other desserts, and they bake focaccia everyday in-house. The owner is friendly and moves quickly! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been renamed Ringtails. New staff is amazing.  Best pizza in town.  Love the new name and love the new food options"}
{"text":"Excellent lattes. Friendly service. Good prices. I highly recommend this place to students looking for an alternate coffee fix on campus!"}
{"text":"For what it is, it is likely to do well. Very reasonable caf√© tucked in the back room of a commercial building. I met my friend here for lunch.  Pleasant easy going place and the owners seem eager to have you come back. I had the baked chicken with potato's. To be honest it was nothing special but it is a great alternative for the local Ryerson Student that want something more than a chemically treated lunch from the local well known fast food joints."}
{"text":"Had lunch while waiting on a print job to finish at the print shop in front.  Great out-of-the-way find!  Arbia is a coffee/pizza, panini and other food specials (pasta salad, panino) cafe. Clean and bright cafe with a friendly staff.  Order at the counter and have a seat.  I had a delicious Panino (special)... A chicken skewer with veggies on a light fresh crusty Italian roll, a lemon aioli (maybe). It was really good.   Nice find near our hotel."}
{"text":"Best pizza. Sicilian style. Nice thick and soft crust. Plus organic salad. What a great lunch."}
{"text":"Love Arbia cafe, love the guys running the place and the food is always fresh and delicious. For Toronto the prices are good, and they make a mean espresso. Would totally recommend"}
{"text":"Can confirm that Arbia is still legit. Got a Panino for lunch this time (~$7) - grilled chicken, bacon, bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiched b/w 2 slices of flat bread w/ spicy mayo. I'm not a sandwich person, and even I liked it. It was a pretty big portion, so you get a nice bang for your buck. They only serve this on certain days though - I think Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fresh pizza around Ryerson. Prices are cheap, friendly staff as well."}
