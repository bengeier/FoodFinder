{"text":"The owners Adam and Kinana are just absolutely amazing! I was excited to see a new establishment where everything is  made and baked from scratch! Very high quality food and sweets! I got the Chicago style cheesecake and the carrot cake was amazing! I can't wait to be back for the breakfast. You guys are amazing!!! Best Wishes!!!!"}
{"text":"It's really sad that people have to copy and paste people's Facebook photos and then create fake Yelp profiles to slam a quality restaurant that uses the best quality ingredients in their products.  What a phony, pusillanimous pipsqueek! Glad I caught this.  All the best wishes Adam and Kinana, the owners.  

If this is reviewed by Yelp staff, please remove the other previous profile associated with my name.

THANK YOU YELP FOR REMOVING THE FAKE REVIEW!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the owner is so proud and attentive. Everything is fresh and you can tell with each bite! Have been for both breakfast and lunch, the French toast for breakfast and hummus for lunch are the best I have had!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant and bakery.  Like all new places it is not perfect yet but it is getting closer.  The baked good are delicious. Made fresh with the finest ingredients daily.  Their croissants are the best I've had since I moved to Arizona. Japanese Cheesecake is light and fluffy. Their pastries change on a daily basis so its fun to stop by and see what they are making today. Their food menu is still developing. I love the mushroom soup, Brioche French toast. Mixed berry crepes and Turkey pesto sandwich.  If you are looking to have a small private party. They have a tea room that holds about 25 people.  Great variety of appetizers and dessert you can order for your private party.  Custom cakes. Local Peixoto coffee. The owners are really nice and are trying very hard to please their customers. This is not a fast food place . If you want a 99cents meal please go to McDonalds.  This is fresh food prepared for you. If you don't like something talk to the owners. About the facility: They have WIFI . Comfortable lounge area you can sit work and enjoy your coffee. Nice patio we can enjoy now that its getting cooler. Really pleasant views and friendly staff. YES they are new so please be patient."}
{"text":"The croissants are amazing. Like real French croissants. Soft and flakey with perfect buttery layers. The danishes are delicious with homemade jam (the cherry is the best). The cheese horns are good as well.

I haven't tried ordering off the menu because the pastries are so good. It's nice to have a proper bakery with yummy pastries and good coffee."}
{"text":"The girls and I were finishing dinner at Pomegranate Cafe and wanted dessert... saw this place in the parking lot and I guess they've only been open 2 weeks. Walked in about 15 min before they closed and were given the royal treatment!! Everything looked so amazing and we couldn't decide so the owners offered to give us a sampling of several of their desserts! They were all amazing! My favorites were the chocolate croissants and lemon bars!! They've got so many influences from around the world in their baking and we really just enjoyed getting to know the owners and hearing their stories. They set us up in their high tea room and just gave the best service!! Will definitely be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"My first visit and it was excellent! Had the Turkey Panini because the suoer-pleasent girl behind the counter recommended it.  Was served quickly and the panini was wonderful.  Nice fresh Greek salad on the side too. 
Definately will be back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm overwhelmed!!! The food is great and the bakery is to die for!! The owners are kind and generous and were nice enough to sample an organic piece of homemade apple pie with fresh whipped cream and Carmel!! WOW! Amazing organic pie!! You have to come and try this place!!! You won't be sorry:)))) trust me!! I'll be back for sure!! Xo Ginger"}
{"text":"Such a gem of a cafe!! Definitely a must to visit for breakfast, lunch or even for some coffee and pastries!! The owner was very pleasant and very mush appreciated that we were there. All the food is homemade and very authentic!!  

And the atmosphere is very quaint and beautiful such a relaxing restaurant!! 

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Over priced and no bacon!  paid $9 for the plate in the picture added that small sausage for $3.  Total was $12. We were expecting more veggies what we got was a garnish. Had to ask for butter and jam. You have to ask for a second cup of coffee. Coffee is weak. OJ is in a bottle. Staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing. Won't come again."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Very impressed. High quality food with great service. Will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 15 after a wedding and we were immediately seated at a table big enough for all of us and within 15 minutes we had food on the table. Service was incredible and the food was top notch. Would deffinetly recomend the Turkey Basil Melt, the Chicken Parm, and the Breakfast Special."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Nothing bad to say. Great breakfast food and the crossants are amazing. The owner is personable and friendly and I love restaurants like that."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant and bakery - super friendly!  I ordered a birthday cake from them and they did an excellent job!  I also ordered some pita and hummus and it was hands down some of the best hummus I've had.  I can't wait to go back and bring the family for breakfast."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST croissants in a 20 mile radius. Even better are the chocolate croissants! All the bakes goods are amazing and worth trying. The prices can be steep but you're paying for quality. I hope with time and better product sourcing the prices will become a bit more reasonable, because then I'd make the drive from Mesa weekly to indulge!"}
{"text":"We had seen this bakery/cafe being built. So glad we tried It! 
Mr Halik claimed croissants are the best one has ever had. They are! I am a croissant snob, but the flaky pastry is the best!!
Coffee is a tad expensive but so much better than other coffee places. Thank You, we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Great service, food, and nice patio. Try it! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is not for me. I ordered a simple 3 egg breakfast with scrambled eggs and they served me omelette style. They don't have reg bacon only turkey bacon. I don't like that they served me a salad on the same plate as my eggs because it just made the lettuce soggy. They didn't offer me butter on my toast.  It also took them 30 mins to serve my food.  The place is cute as far as design. When I walked up to order I wasn't greeted by the owner I'm assuming. I started to order and he ignored me and grabbed a menu and told the people coming in that they serve breakfast all day. So like I said this place was not for me."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed. I ordered a cake for an event on Saturday for 50 people. She said she would send a design but never did. I was underwhelmed with the finished product. It was just a sheet cake, white with a few little designs; no creativity at all.  It wasn't even ready for me to pick up at the pre arranged time and I had to wait for it. It was covered in a thick covering, not frosting, and was very difficult to cut through, there was barely any filling at all, the cake was dry and not flavorful. The worst part was that they had no box for it. They wrapped it in celophane which of course got on the lettering it causing it to smear on the cake itself. The cake was placed on a slippery platform and slid all over the place while I was driving. I literally had to hold it with my hand and even that didn't work because I was trying to drive and it was heavy. Green dye stained my auto interior and my clothes. The tiny bit of frosting on the sides did not stick at all and fell off in my car in clumps. Total disaster. I paid nearly $200 for what I thought would be a professionally done cake by a \"baker\". It was wrecked by the time we got to the event and put a damper on something I'd been planning for months. I could have made a better one myself with boxed cake mix and canned frosting. Awful."}
{"text":"Very good food and owners couldn't be anymore accommodating and hospitable. I highly recommend you check them out. Clean and comfortable as well as a nice patio."}
{"text":"Met an associate here for a business meeting a couple of weeks ago and grabbed an almond croissant while waiting. 

Their almond croissants are one of the best things I ever ate. Flaky, light on the outside and slightly chewy with just the right amount of sweetness inside. Absolute perfection. 

Was in Ahwatukee again this morning and decided to stop in for a full breakfast. Glad I did because the Egg Boat is also one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. A light bread crust w three cheeses topped with two perfect eggs and served with a small greek salad and roasted potatoes and zucchini. Again, just perfect. 

In Arcadia, Scottsdale or Tempe this place would have a line waiting out the door every morning and be beating off professional reviewers with a stick."}
{"text":"Open on a Saturday at 8pm!!! Early baker opens at 6am and closes at 9pm every day!! The place is clean and the owner was running the bakery counter! He gave each of us a chocolate chip cookie that we all thought would be hard and crumbly but wasn't!!! I would go back for those cookies alone!! We got a 'sample' of most of the items. Each one was as good as the next! What a great local place! I recommend this place and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Seemingly charming place, but their menu isn't the best. Their \"steak and eggs\" is thinly sliced roast beef (lunch meat, seriously) with a side salad. Although we didn't know that the salad came with extra protein, a fly!! A whole, dead bug right on top. 

They are very nice people and tried to make up for it with coupons, free desserts, etc but to be honest I was too grossed out to take part on their offer. Just don't do it, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We dined at Early Baker on a quiet Monday evening and quite enjoyed our experience. I love the passion fruit iced tea!  That being said our dinners were excellent ...  we ordered the gyro and rice pilaf entrees which included a fresh side salad! Besides being tasty the food was nicely plated and the owner personally served us. Will be heading back soon to try their breakfast menu"}
{"text":"The food here is not very good.  I ordered breakfast of 3 eggs over medium with toast, potatoes, and fruit.  The only thing tasty was the fruit.  The eggs were very runny and the potatoes were mushy.  The toast was ok but they don't give you any butter or jam.  My husband had a Greek salad which he said was just ok.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I have come to enjoy and seek out the best in baked goods, regardless of where we are in the world. I'm used to waiting in long lines, and the whole experience feels quite impersonal.  However, at the Early Baker, on my first visit, the owners (and pastry chef) greeted us.  We had a butter croissant, almond croissant, spinach and cheese pastry, and a cream puff.  They were some of the best we've ever had, rivaling the best in San Francisco and NYC. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My review is based on their breakfast menu, we did not try any of their pastries which had good reviews. Anytime a new place opens up in Ahwatukee, we are always excited to try it. A group of friends went there for breakfast and was under whelmed. First of all, don't call it steak and eggs when it's thinly sliced roast beef. That is very misleading. Also, when ordering a side of turkey sausage, keep in mind it is $3 for ONE 2\" mini sausage sliced in half. I had the Early American which consisted of a toasted white plain bread sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon. Not real bacon, but turkey bacon. I'm ok with turkey bacon, but real bacon is entirely different. It was served with 2 slices of cucumbers, 2 wedges of tomatoes and seasoned potatoes. The potatoes looked so good, but was so disappointed when we took a bite. It was not cooked enough. A friend had the French toast drizzled with strawberries which looked amazing and she enjoyed it. 

The portions were really small as well and we spent about $40 for 2 breakfasts entrees and 2 drinks. That's a lot of money for mediocre breakfast to begin with and to have the portions small and not very good, is disappointing to say the least. Unfortunately, all of us don't think we will return. They are nice there, but we felt like we wasted our money. We would've been ok with smaller portions for the price if the food was better quality.

The other reviews on the pastries seem to be really good. If that's the case, focus on the bakery items and make that the star and incorporate that into your menu."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The owners are very nice. The coffee is great. I loved the vegan burrito. I definitely will come here again. They say if you call ahead of time they can make more vegan food. My friend loved the almond croissant."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Early Baker for breakfast this morning after walking by yesterday and hearing live music going on their patio. (They are currently on their soft launch.)

The location is great for Ahwatukee residents looking for another place to eat. Comfortable chairs and tables with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. 

The owner and employees were incredibly friendly - they asked my name, made a few pastry recommendations and even gave me a free (very tasty) cookie. I was there on my computer for a while and they were attentive without being intrusive the entire time. 

I was going to order a croissant but they were already out - instead I ordered a pastry with a cheese filling and one with spinach, both savory with flaky pastry. My latte was also very good. 

I'm excited Early Baker is in the neighborhood and look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"I heard this place opened and was on my list to try
Ended up there today with a friend to check out
Awesome!!!
The nicest people that run it
Very passionate about their work and product
It is a business of love being put into there product
They said if it's not the best you've ever had they would refund our money lol
Spinach cheese puffs were melt in your mouth fantastic and flavorful 
We sampled the tomorrow basil soup nice and light and flavorful but not bitter and over powerful, sweet
Tried the chocolate cake which was amazingly light but the chocolate on the top was not hard but creamy melt in your mouth and not icing mmmmm
Even coffee was specially selected and purchase local from family that has a coffee farm in Brazil
Also has a private room available for parties lunches and high tea!
Breakfast and lunch menus with great selections
Open 6 am till 9 or 10 pm!"}
{"text":"I came in to get some pastries and bread for work, but end up buying one of each of everything! I bought at leasy one of each sandwich cookie, macarons, blueberry muffin, banana nut muffin, lemon squares, and more. Figured my co-workers would devour them. I also bought a loaf of sourdough bread. My favourite favorite things were their croissants. I ordered one chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one took me back to a French bakery. I will be back! Excited to have this gem in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"2nd time around was  Even better. The lemon crepes are insane. The chocolate croissant is off the chain. You absolutely have to come here."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!  I have tried most of their desserts and every one has been unique and decadent.  The owners are so kind and have such a true talent for baking.  This is would be a perfect place to go for any meal!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. 

After several awful experiences at Pomegranate, we were happy to see a new breakfast option open. Check out my review of Pomegranate for more details. 

We've been in about 3 times now and loved it all 3 times. There are so few places like this anymore. The amount of pride put into everything they do is so incredible!  So far, I don't think we've found a single thing that isn't made from scratch. My girlfriend asked for hot sauce. One of the owners kindly obliged. When he got back he brought 2 store bought hot sauces along with a cup of his homemade. He said we could try the store bought \"not so good one\", or try his. He was absolutely right. We used the whole cup. 

The pride even goes into the water that is used for coffee. We don't drink soda. We always order water with meal. The same owner said to make sure to use the water on the soda machine because they use a top notch filtration system. 

There was a family with a toddler right next to us. At one point, the child had dropped a small toy on the floor. The owner came from behind the counter, actually wiped the toy off with a clean towel, and gave it to the parents. On my first visit, one of the owners took my 11 year old daughter to watch her decorate cookies for an upcoming birthday party. She gave my daughter a sample as well. That's service. 

The breakfast and pastries are delicious. I love cannolis and this place has them. Naturally, all aspects of them, including the shells, are made from scratch. 

So if you have the option, skip Pomegranate and go here. It's a way better experience all around."}
{"text":"Fabulous food fast great! I had vegan burrito other family members had crapes they were on the smaller side but amazing flavor. Hubby had eggs Florentine. He loved it."}
{"text":"Im a foodie and this Early Baker is amazing. Fresh bread and yes pita that is egg free an gluten free but lots of pastries for people with no dietary restrictions. Soups, bread, hummus, etc, all homemade. A relaxing and inviting place you don't want to rush and leave. Great BYOB for happy hour, backgammon game, relaxing sofa chairs and even upright hammocks outside. Put this place on your must to do list."}
{"text":"My family went to Early Baker for the first time today and we had a wonderful experience! The owner was so friendly and accommodating to my toddler and baby and didn't flinch at the mess they made. The food and drinks were incredibly fresh and tasty! My husband had the French toast (you must try this!) and I had the egg white omelette with the most delicious oven roasted vegetables. We love supporting local business and will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've read that they are on a soft launch, based on that and that I really want to support a local business I will give them another chance.

Food today was not bad but disappointed, Early Egg with tomato, cucumber, olives and toast (came with no toast and olives, had to request they send it) - the tomato and cucumber are really more like a garnish.. so pricey for such a simple dish.

The place looks good, service was also good, fast and polite."}
{"text":"Always satisfying !!!I love their great croissant.
Cannot say enough about the owners ,They're always welcoming us with a warm smile .
Highly recommended !!!
It is my to go place ."}
{"text":"Passed this place several times and finally tried it today with my family. It's delicious! Fresh ingredients and great flavor! I had the French toast and it was better than expected!"}
{"text":"I love Early Baker! The food and service are wonderful. Everything I've had is delicious. I stopped by for Turkish Coffee one morning around 9 am. The croissants were fresh and warm right out of the oven. They are not just for breakfast though! Lunch and dinner are just as good. My husband had their Linguine & Clam special last week ($7.99) and was blown away! We were told the chef used to be the chef at Los Dos Molinos. This place is not too be missed!"}
{"text":"I loved this place from the moment we walked in. The owner greeted us and made a very delicious cafe mocha with vanilla for me and a cold brew for my boyfriend. Keep in mind it's Thanksgiving today so after having such an amazing breakfast, we came back for the Thanksgiving lunch! I'm thankful they were open today! 

We definitely found a little gem in Ahwatukee! The owner has so hospitable and his wife is an amazing cook! I wish them the greatest success!! Oh and btw....best croissants EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes,  this place just isn't good. My social media feed has been saturated with promotions for this restaurant,  so I stopped by with my kids.   I let them pick from the pastry display while I had the egg boat. They chose croissants, which were dry like they were old.  My egg boat,  on the other hand,  was under done.   When I ordered it, the gentleman that took my order seemed like he didn't know what I was asking for even though the item is on the menu on the back wall. The bread under baked, and the egg was overcooked. The yolk was cooked all the way through. It is disappointing since this is not a cheap joint considering the small portions. My coffee tasted stale and I heard another patron saying the same.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The pastries and coffee are the best I've ever had in Phoenix. This place reminds me of an East coast upscale cafe, it's unlike any place in Phoenix. It's clean and bright. The pastries and deserts are the best. The owners are warm and eager to have customers linger and enjoy the atmosphere as well as the food. It's not the place for a big Sunday brunch, but rather the perfect place to bring a book or friend to sip coffee and snack on a variety of yummy baked goods. 
This is what I've tried so far:
1) Home made cheese cake heavenly, unlike anything I've had before. Not too sweet, blueberries mixed in, slightly lemony. 
2) fresh croissants, almond croissants are my favorite
Plain croissant was the best I've ever had
3) Macaroons are amazing 
4) Latte with the house vanilla is the best 
5) Lemon bars are yummy
6) hummus is yummy, authentic and fresh with warm pita and veggies
7) rice pilaf was fragrant and baked in a flaky pocked"}
{"text":"I simply cannot express enough my SINCEREST thanks for the BEAUTIFUL birthday tea party Owners Adam and Kinana hosted in the cafe's private room yesterday for my daughter's 11th birthday!! From the first moment we booked it, they took GREAT CARE to ensure that this was THE BEST and most SPECIAL party ever for my daughter! Adam and Kinana seemed as excited as we all were for the party details and Paris theme!! They even decorated the room for us, and all I had to do was drop off the decorations!! It was AMAZING!! And of course the food, tea, and custom Eiffel Tower cake was all top notch!! This beautiful family have hearts of gold and they truly treat every customer with sincere love and care!! Adam even kept the party moms entertained by whipping up special appetizer treats for us while we waited in the comfy cafe lounge chairs! I recommend them for ANY special occasion -- or just pop in to enjoy the cafe on a regular day!"}
{"text":"Stopped for Sunday am breakfast- one spinach pastry which was tasty but light on spinach.
one steak & egg breakfast - roast beef is not steak!Dry toast served without butter or jelly. By the time we got butter the toast was cold & butter came from refrigerator.  Got Neapolitan  to go- it wasn't fresh. Eggs served at least 5 min before spinach pie which just had to be reheated. 
Might try again for lunch but wasn't impressed w breakfast."}
{"text":"I hope to be able to update this review soon and give them another star. I've been in 2x during the soft opening. I think it's important to note that the visits were during the soft opening and it is clear they are trying to figure out their processes and tweak things. The family that owns/operates is very nice and customer service is good, but there are some kinks that need to be worked out. First visit lattes and pastry, took awhile and lattes were luke warm, addressed the issue and they tried again, still luke warm. Pastry was good but a little burnt on the edges. Second visit ordered food, coffee, smoothie. Sat down and never got my coffee until food came out and I asked for it. Also had to remind them about the smoothie. Food comes out piece by piece vs. entire order which I've never been a fan of. Food itself is good. Smoothie was good. Iced tea is really good and the staff told me it's their own blend. Very cute decor. Lots of potential. I think this place will get there...they just gotta find their groove."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here and have breakfast/lunch and were nicely surprised. The inside is beautiful, bright, open , clean , spacious. the food was great also. The owner was gracious and funny. Will come again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday and the food was delicious!! I got the Brioche French Toast and it was amazing! Everything on it was made from scratch except the delicious fresh fruit on top. The service was really quick and we got to meet the owner (who is very welcoming and funny). Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"You have to drop in and say hello to Adam, the owner. He will ensure you have the best dining experience possible. He always treats us with baked items that just came out of the oven. The breakfasts are phenomenal, the coffee is absolutely superb. He takes great pride in his cappuccinos, lattes, and Turkish coffee. The food is fresh, the highest quality, and he is a joy to chat with. You won't be disappointed. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods, Turkish coffee was just what I expected(really strong and good) and very friendly guy working there. I will come back to try more than just pastries."}
{"text":"Been here several times for breakfast and lunch.  Just had their Early American breakfast ( egg and bacon sandwich, potatoes, and Greek salad).  It was great!  If you've been here, come again.  They keep getting better and better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The owners are really nice and really treat their customers like family. The food is delicious and all homemade. We especially love the egg boats!"}
{"text":"Excited to have this high quality bakery / cafe in Ahwatukee. The staff is exceptional. Knows what makes their products different than what you are going to find anywhere else in the area. Very clean and accommodating environment. They have a private tea room. I had a chocolate truffle and hazelnut & almond biscotti. Outstanding"}
{"text":"Was very excited to have a new place open so close to home. Went for breakfast and was very disappointed. Breakfast sandwich was 2 pieces of regular bread, egg, bacon & cheese smashed in.Panini maker so it was very flat and not to tasty. Potatos were bland and dry. The sandwich with only water to drink was $13 with tax. Hardly any baked goods in case and it was 10 am in.the morning. Was disappointed to say the least. No friendly service when placing the order and server kept trying to give us some one else's order. To many other good places to go to so probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for breakfast, lunch and brunch! The owners are kind attentive and charming. The food is fabulous! The sweets are also to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for now my Vegan diet has ended due to personal reasons which i will not get into here. So my stomach was growling and i seen EarlyBaker ill keep it short and simple since im waiting on uber. Food taste amazing , very clean restaurant, make sure to check them out if your around Chandler Arizona.  I had the mushroom soup and bbq chicken panini with side salad. Tastes Amazing! 5 STARZ *****"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast. This resturant is brightly colored, very clean, and relaxing with booths, wood tables and grouping of comfortable chairs around a coffee table. There is also outside seating. At this  resturant you order at the counter where  behind the counter is brightly lit breakfast menu. The countet is filled with all sorts of tarts, baklava, macaroons and pastry.  Okay, if you know me, you know I love my coffee.  Well the coffee is really good.  Self sevice for water is found around the corner from the counter. So I got the egg boat.  OMG soft dough with different types of cheese on top melted while the dough is cooking and than two eggs are on top cooked perfectly.  It was wonderful. Doug got the Greek egg sandwich.  Both came with a Greek salad. We both really enjoyed our breakfast and plan to come back for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh made food, nice family owned and operated restaurant. Very friendly! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Tuesday as a part of a book discussion group. The book we're reading is called The Go Giver by Bob Burg.

I didn't order any food because I arrived to the meeting at the last minute. The food that my companions ordered looked really tasty and they confirmed it as such. Next week, I'll get breakfast.

The owner brought us some samples (full-size slices) of cake and cheesecake to try. The cheesecake was amazing! Now, maybe you're thinking that \"everyone likes cheesecake, so big deal?\" 

Well, as it happens, I don't really like cheesecake. It seems like a very dense and unsophisticated dessert to me. I'd rather have something like Tiramisu or Creme Brulee. This cheesecake had a lightness to it that could only come from someone that has been baking for years. Really exceptional bakers KNOW exactly the moment they've stirred enough for the texture of a bread, cake or pastry to be perfect. This cheesecake had that exceptional quality to it.

More than the food though, EarlyBaker set itself apart from most everywhere I visit in this valley, having a joyful and upbeat owner. He really exemplifies the spirit of the book that we're reading. He loves people and it shows and I genuinely appreciate that!

As for the naysayers about this business, I'd say that if they had a complaint or grievance about the quality or value of the food the owner would have loved to hear from them directly. I know he would take the time to listen and make the situation more positive for them.

Highly recommended.

Some music for atmosphere would be nice though.

Next time I'll add photos. I didn't think I'd like the cheesecake, so I ate it before I took a picture. D'oh!  :-D"}
{"text":"I had a chocolate filled croissant. It was the best croissant ever.
Next I had french toast. It was home made brioche bread.there was home made whipped cream and home made syrup. The best ever.

They have games to entertain kids. 

Ask for the Spiced Turkish Coffee. Stronger than Cuban coffee. Comes with cardamom.

The sweetest couple own and run this place. She was trained in Japan and Switzerland. That explains everything. 

I will always come back. Wow."}
{"text":"On the fence with this place. The decor is really cute, they did a great job with making it comfy and feeling like your at home. The service and food are really lacking. My hubby and I went for lunch and walked in with one other table of two ahead of us. There were only a few things on the menu that we'd consider trying so that's not a good start. There was a large group already seated in a side room and looked to be eating already and another couple that were finished so getting trendy to leave. That left 4 people only to have to cook for and I guess they felt the same as us regarding the menu cause they we ordered the same things except my hubby and me just ordered water with our meal. The lady at the counter who took our order got us the water right away but didn't bother to tell us that it was self service around the corner. Also what looked to be the owner was pacing around like he was either waiting for something or lost but didn't appear friendly at all. Not even a hey thanks for coming in to try the place. Anyway as far as the wait for the food wow!  Okay so your making 4 sandwiches, 2 of each kind and after abt 20 minutes of waiting the lady who took both our orders comes out to asks each of our tables to confirm our orders. That's 1 turkey panini and 1 chicken wrap per table. And then we waited another 20 minutes. Seriously people 40 minutes for sandwiches? I get made to order but really? So the paninis come out first. One for each table they looked nicely presented with a side salad then another few minutes she brings the chicken wrap with a side of what looked to be leftover breakfast potatoes. We split our food so that we each could taste it. I could tell immediately we were going to be really disappointed with our lunch. The panini literally had 2 very thinly sliced pieces of turkey and was served between whole wheat pots warmed but definitely not toasted on a panini press. The overall flavor was okay but nothing special. It needed more meat for a $11 sandwich. Yes, $12 for 2 slices of deli meat. Terrible. Then for the chicken wrap.  A huge tortilla with very little stuffing. We weren't surprised there. The chicken we abt 4oz and very little lettuce and a sprinkling of tomato.  But the garlic sauce they use as mayo was way over powering. Like kill a vampire too much. And it tasted to be garlic just mixed with Greek yogurt and a lot of garlic. It was not good and again another $12. This place is not gonna make it. The bakery didn't really offer a lot of what the demographics of the area will purchase. Some muffins and a couple variety of cookies won't cut it.  I couldn't tell if they are trying to be a bakery that sells some sandwiches and salads or a restaurant that sells bakery goods. Either way I don't see these owners making it but they did a great job of cleaning the place up from the pit that los dos left."}
{"text":"I'm glad we stoped by and checked this place out. Two happy kids after having the Nutella crepe and Mixed Berry crepe. A great addition to Ahwatukee. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Early Baker is a hidden gem in Ahwatukee.  Tucked into the Safeway plaza on Chandler Blvd, its family oriented relaxed atmosphere makes it the perfect locale for a cup of coffee with a friend or a family breakfast/lunch.  The owners are warm and friendly-- always happy to see you.  They greet you with a smile and invite you to linger over delectable pastries and delicious coffee.  I have never had a more marvelous macaroon than from Early Baker!"}
{"text":"Brilliantly executed baked goods.

The cream puff was out-of-this world airy with a creamy filling not tooo sweet not too heavy...Just Right!
Cake pops! Macaroons! Fancy cookies! Croissants and more.........support this local bakery and live happily ever after."}
{"text":"Just come see for yourself. My first time at the Early Baker and what really impressed me right off the bat was the décor; homely with a touch of modern-industrial. The pastries were splendid, one of the best croissants I have ever had. The brioche french toast was to die for. Will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place after shopping at Trader Joe's.  I took home a turkey panini, a piece of cheese cake and 2 spinach puff pastries.  Loved every bite!  The panini was enough for 2 people.  It came with a delicious salad and was very good.  The puff pastries were nice and so was the cheese cake.  I want to go there for breakfast.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. The salads and baked goods are my favorite.  Especially the croissants.  The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. The young man at the register was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing desserts! Every single item was wonderful but my favorites were the cheesecake and the chocolate croissant.  I will be back for breakfast and lunch.  Both the owners were just the cutest,  kindest,  and funnest people.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is a family run business & the owners are super sweet & quality oriented. The main baker, Kinana studied baking in Japan and learned how to make delicious treats like Japanese Cheesecake, which i was excited to see because ive been seeing that all over facebook lately and really wanted to try it. It was super light and fluffy yet decadent, i loved it. Im not too into pastries, but my mom tried them and she loved every single one. Ive taken so many friends here, it has such a nice atmosphere, and its a great place for students to go if they want to hang out or study as they have wifi and its pretty quiet in there. Their chocolate chip cookies are a must try, they are so good.  All in all its amazing, you need to check it out."}
{"text":"I love the Early Baker! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is charming and the customer service is incredible! Though I've never been to France, a foodie friend of mine has and she told me the croissants rival French bakeries!! I love a good pastry and their baked goods are GREAT!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered breakfast to go. The crepes come with 2 per order. I couldn't decide between savory or sweet, so the owner suggested I get one of each/mix and match for the same price. At his suggestion, I got the smoked turkey and pesto crepe, and I also ordered the Nutella and banana crepe. Both were good, but wow I am glad I listened to his suggestion for the turkey and pesto crepe! It was amazing. I would like to come back to try the dinner specials because it looks really reasonably priced and hopefully tastes as good as the breakfast."}
{"text":"Great spot for any meal of the day! We salivated over the breakfast menu but went with lunch since it was noon. The chicken wrap was perfect! Moist flavorful chicken, garlic sauce and greens wrapped in a deliciously toasted wrap. I substituted the potatoes with a side salad which was perfectly dressed. 

My friend loved the BBQ chicken panini and we got to taste 2 delicious soups. The only thing we didn't get to partake in were the delicious looking baked goods. That's because the servings are all very generous and we had no room for dessert. Next time we'll start with dessert or a croissant.
P.S. They are open all week. Posting of hours is incorrect."}
{"text":"This was a real find! They were so hospitable. The food was delicious and fresh. The pita bread was especially good. I ordered for a crew with various food allergies and they were extremely patient and accommodating. I was confident serving those with allergies since they make their food from scratch. There were plenty of deserts made fresh from scratch. After eating their food, I can't wait to go back for desert."}
{"text":"Great staff. Very friendly and helpful. 
Food was fabulous.we went for breakfast. The options were egg related but you had a large selection including crepes. There are also fresh bakery items for something light."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times since opening and really enjoy the food! My favorite is the Nutella crepes and my fiancé loves the turkey and Swiss. Everything is very fresh and has a great taste and the staff is welcoming. We will continue to keep coming here and trying out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This is a new place to Chandler and I was curious so I came by. It is Greek/Mediterranean/Arabic food and also other things.  I had Banana and Peanut butter smoothie, Meat roll and Panini bbq chicken. Staff and Owner were friendly and cooked up food right away. Meat roll was delicious with ground beef and saffron, bbq chicken panini was good but a little bold. Smoothie was delicious.    Very good spot I recmmend!"}
{"text":"Holy Crepe!!!! This place is DELICIOUS!!! Everything fresh. Had the Mediterranean crepe. Amazing!!! Wife had a chocolate bomb! Can't even put into words!!! Got to try!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast and everything was very good.  Very cute & cozy inside.  The service was excellent and staff was friendly.  Left with a coconut macaroon for later and it was probably one of the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant, Crepes and Croissant are delicious! Nice and friendly staff.  
This will be our new hang out place."}
{"text":"First time here, I came here for croissants and they were out of them! What kind of bakery is out of croissants by 9:00AM. So I got a breakfast sandwich instead and it was bland."}
{"text":"A new bkfst spot in Ahwatukee!  Food is fresh and good.  Menu is good. Pastries are delicious.  Owners are very nice.  Ambiance is clean, crisp, and modern.  
The only reason I did not give 5 stars was a couple of items they need to improve and lock down or folks will not return, even if the food is great.  Got our coffee...no cream.  Requested silverware.  There was no dressing on the side salad, had to ask.  Toast barely toasted and no perceivable butter on it.  It seems they need someone to pay more attention to these details.  They also need to advertise more - this place is a mile from me and I never knew it existed for 4 months!
We think the prices are reasonable - much more so than Snooze - and the owners are charming.  Just needs some guidance.  Please don't close!"}
{"text":"Very cute new local restaurant. Food is unique and has a European and Middle Eastern twist. Very good croissants here, better than most you can find in Phoenix. I recommend the rice pilaf for lunch, ot was fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!  Perfectly cooked eggs on the most amazing croissant I have ever had and I've traveled Europe where the croissant was was born!  Seriously...I can't wait to eat the decadent pastries, muffins, cupcakes and other dishes they have on the menu!!  The owners and staff could not be any more gracious!!! This restaurant is a wonderful addition to our neighborhood! Clean, nice seating great location and did I say...delicious!!  I can't wait till tomorrow to try something else :-)"}
{"text":"Giving this place 3 stars until they figure out their service- everyone was pretty nice and accommodating but my coffee came out after 10 mins and was not even hot! Our food came out after waiting for 40 minutes! The egg and cheese melt was pretty legit- my 7 and 10 year old loved them! For a fast casual it was a bit pricey- our bill was 47 without tips for 3 dishes and a cafe mocha.  We spoke to what I assume was one of the owners and was told that the ingredients they used was only the best.  He also apologized and said they were in a soft launch- he should make that apparent so expectations would be lower.  I wish this place the best!"}
{"text":"I live out in East Mesa and finally got to check out this gem in Ahwatukee today!! Such a cute environment and great customer service. The owners gave my son a cake pop while we waited (which wasn't long at all) My mom and I split the pesto turkey panini and it was delicious!!! Also check out the macaroons the mango one is the best!!"}
{"text":"Awesome home cooked food, love the turkey coffee! Great have this in my community."}
{"text":"Bakery, burritos, coffee, breakfast - this place is amazing! Turkish coffee is very strong for anyone looking for something new+strong. Vegan burrito amazing. Lots of cookie options. Business owner is super sweet; staff is super sweet."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight it was excellent. The food was amazing. We really enjoyed eating at a family-owned restaurant gives us a much different feeling than other restaurants. So cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"One star, soley on how nice they redid the inside of this restautant and it's as low as I can go. Aside from that, this place is terrible and I was highly dissapointed.

Not sure where to even start... We went in for breakfast, ordered some coffee and food. About 15 minutes went by before we had to ASK for our coffee. It was brought to us with no cream, sugar or spoon. Coffee was not hot and most definitely watered down. A very sad looking breakfast sandwhich followed, of course accompanied with no silverware, salt or pepper. 

The Early Greek sandwhich which was supposed to be a veggie frittata on fresh baked bread was served to us as plain scrambled eggs on dry white wonder bread, toasted like a panini. My spinach pie, which I had to ask about just like the coffee was going to be a few extra minutes as they were \"cooking it fresh\". I was under the impression they forgot about it, but whatever. It was served to me moments later, still frozen.

My next concern... is this even a real bakery? Where are the free smells?! I think the Early Baker is a fraud.com

This place has a lot of potential but needs a serious management intervention. Their location is great and Ahwatukee is thirsty for more breakfast spots. On a Saturday morning, this place should be packed! Instead, the employees were running around frazzled with only just a couple of tables. 

I gave it a go and can confidently say that there is no way I'll be giving this place a second chance. Good luck to this place. You can have the nicest restaurant around but if you food and service sucks... chances are you won't be around for long."}
{"text":"Our first trip to this new restaurant and it was delicious. You could tell they put a lot of thought and love into their food from the dinner to desserts we had tonight. We had the daily special, salmon plate and a sample of desserts. Service was great as well. Adam gave my daughter a balloon as she was tired."}
{"text":"I've been to the early baker 3x now. I think that they are still finding their way around so it's not always fair to be critical at this time. Having said that... 1st time staff was not friendly or welcoming, pastries were good but the eclair was very tiny and overpriced in my opinion. 2nd time there was literally one pastry available so I left. 3rd time got cloud cheesecake and chocolate croissant for $10 which I think is on the pricy side especially for the size of the cheesecake. I like a croissant with some color ( European style) but the croissant had a burned flavor so it was just a tad over baked and for $5 I expect perfection. This last time one of the owners was at the register and polite but not engaging and for a new business that seems counterintuitive. I can see the direction they are going in but they aren't there yet and for the $ I'm hesitant to go back for another 6 months when I'm hoping they have it together. Sorry I'm pretty critical but I had a restaurant and know the challenges in the beginning so I speak from experience in the business. I wish them success and applaud having a small craft business in the area."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but the food is pretty bad. Ordered the Americano sandwich that comes with bacon and sausage. The way it is described in the menu it sounded like it was on the sandwich. Nope. No biggie though. I am pretty certain the sausage and bacon they serve is the fake kind. Bland sandwich but over seasoned potatoes and the restaurant bland awful water downed coffee to boot."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to Ahwatukee! The best pasteries and desserts you can find anywhere in Ahwatukee! The owners were so wonderful to us. They went above and beyond with their wonderful service. The food is truly delicious! The High Tea room is beautiful and will serve as a perfect venue for many occasions!"}
{"text":"Love it! The food & service was great. I will return soon. Oh & they also have vegan options."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place. They've cleaned up the two-storefront space they are in. And we love the idea of a locally-owned breakfast spot being so close to home. 

But there is a huge difference between being an excellent baker and running a top-flight restaurant. In the same way that an Engineer alone can't make Intel a great business. 

My crepe tasted like it had been Pre-made and then rolled to order. 

My wife ordered a side of potatoes and got charged for a meal. 

My daughter ordered what was touted as breakfast eggs and vegetables...and the veggies turned out to be spinach. 

We had to ask for water. 

We had to ask for table service (napkins and silverware). 

For what should be a family-friendly place, both high chairs were in use when we arrived. 

The location is awesome. The patio will be great when the weather improves. The staff were very friendly, but in need of training. 

We will be back because we want to see this place thrive."}
{"text":"Today I went to the early baker and had the best french Macerons, croissants, and middle eastern food. My favorite dish is their eggplant dish. Omg to die for, ask for pita bread with it. You can get it with or without kabob. The owner makes custom cakes that look like they are too beautiful to eat. If you want to host private parties they are very affordable. I am hosting one there in June and can not wait to have more of their middle eastern food. Go there for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed!!!!! Here is a picture of a cake there."}
{"text":"Recently had Adam and his team cater an event for our first American title office here in Ahwatukee. Everybody loved the food,  Adam and his team are great to work with the prices are decent.  If you have a chance to go and actually have a dine in experience at this location I would highly recommend it either for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"MUST VISIT! :) I have been to this pearl 2 times and all I can say in one word is WOW. I had a mixed plate of lasagna, pasta and a piece of garlic bread with $8!!!! What a deal! I also had the best tiramisu. I have had Italian foods at other pricy Italian restaurants in the Valley, but Early Baker is my favorite with highest quality and delicious foods which are very close to the ones I had in Italy! The restaurant is well designed both inside and outside eating area. It is very clean and cozy!. Adam, the owner was so friendly and always made sure that I was happy with my food. I will definitely come back to explore more their menu!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. Both times we had the soup which was delicious and seemed homemade. The Greek plate is delicious. Just enough food to constitute a reasonable serving and filling. The salad was fresh and the gyro meat which they said they made in house was delicious. We have tried some of the desserts as well and the cinnamon roll was delicious as was the Napoleon. The baklava had a delicious flavor with honey reminiscent of lavender. 

The owners are very friendly and the ambience is nice with both indoor and outdoor eating areas. I think they might need to lower prices a bit or amp up the advertising because it hasn't been very busy when I've gone. I hope others in Tukee will come out to support local business because this place has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"I just had a lovely brunch here with the hubby. The place is so cute, very nicely decorated. Clean and bright. When we walked in we were greeted warmly and informed they have FREE coffee on Fridays! I couldn't really decide on what I wanted so I got the brioche French toast, and the turkey mushroom pesto crepe. We were also told that they have the BEST croissants we have ever tasted, which I rolled my eyes at the comment because I don't like when people over-promise and I typically end up disappointed. To my surprise, the croissants were excellent (I got the plain with homemade apricot and strawberry jelly), probably the best I've had outside of France.

They told us that everything is organic, non-GMO, and homemade. I don't know how to confirm the organic, non-GMO claim, but everything definitely tasted fresh and homemade.

Very good experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Fast friendly service. Great food with and healthy Mediterranean flare. Omar made sure to get my family every thing we needed. Was very pleased with my first visit, I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them."}
{"text":"I feel like this place doesn't exactly understand what their brand is yet. It's like... a bakery, and breakfast/lunch place and Greek too? That all doesn't seem to mix. The food is ok, but I feel like it's not breakfast food. I ordered steak and eggs and I got a Greek salad, SWEET sweet eggs, and roast beef with mozzarella on it. Roast beef is not steak... It's roast beef... do not advertise it as such. Their hummus also lacks flavor. It was worth trying since I had never been here before but more than likely I won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything I eat here is as good or better than I have eaten anywhere else  Croissants are the best I've ever had.  Ditto crepes.  Just eaten Chicken Marsala for dinner and I can't remember having better.  There's an obvious love and passion for the food that shows up in everything they produce and they absolutely have the skill to back it up.  You'll never go wrong with anything you order.  Tough for me to go anywhere else now."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this restaurant to open up for long time. The location was perfect for me. I was not sure whether it was typical breakfast/brunch place or dessert place. It was little bit of both. They serve all day. The restaurant is very clean and big. They also have very nice outdoor space. You order your food at the counter and tk a seat yourself. We ordered the \"early greek\" and \"early cheese melt\" sandwitch. Both of the sandwitch were lacking everything. It was just egg with toasted bread. The cheese melt did not have much cheese. The salad that came with was ok. The price seemed to be little high as well."}
{"text":"Good breakfast -- open early -- great service. There are lots of interesting choices on the menu. Definitely worth stepping by."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and pastries!!  Everything,even the brioche is made in house.  The owner is kind and staff very friendly.  Love this neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Well...that wasn't what I was hoping for.  I've been looking forward to a breakfast spot opening near my house and this one is a short walk away.  Needless to say, I was amped to try it.  

On the morning I arrived it was dead quiet (no background music).  That was corrected later about 20 minutes later but it was a real weird vibe to start.  The folks working the counter didn't seem to have much training.  I ordered an iced coffee which was served to me in a coffee mug with no ice.  It was kind of embarrassing to explain to someone working in a breakfast restaurant that that isn't the way it works.  

For food I went with some pastries.  The scone was good.  The croissant was good.  The croissant was also $4.  For a mid-size croissant.  Breakfast entrees on the menu started at about $11.  There is a glaring lack of value.  If you have two people eating breakfast items it'll be north of $30.  

It's a new restaurant so I'm aware that there will be some issues. I will give it another try but my first impression doesn't have me hurrying back."}
{"text":"Was just introduced to the Early Baker. The owner is amazing and so dedicated to serving clean, real food without antibiotics or hormones. He was so welcoming and let us sample multiple pastries and the Japanese cheese cake. Everything was divine. I can't wait to go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.  Their food items are very tasty while their pastries are not too sweet.  Their salad dressing is light, but just enough."}
{"text":"We have traveled far and wide in each of the cities we have visited to find the best bakeries. We recently moved to Phoenix  from the Bay Area and would frequent Tartine, waiting in long lines to buy their delectable baked goods. We now live in Ahwahtukee, and we have a neighborhood bakery that rivals Tartine!  No lines!  When the owner said their croissants were the best, I'm not going to lie. I was very skeptical.  The proof was in the tasting. The croissants are flaky and buttery, melting in the mouth. The almond croissant is a must buy! In addition to that flaky, buttery pastry, the frangipane is light and fluffy with a wonderful almond flavor. The spinach pastries were delicious as well, and the flavor the spinach was so yummy. We also had a cream puff, which was filled with a delicious, light cream. We plan on coming here often. The owners came out to greet us personally, making the whole experience wonderful."}
{"text":"If eating a ham and cheese omelette is your thing this is not the place for you. They do not serve any pork products. They do however offer turkey products with their egg dishes. The pastries/cakes are to die for. They taste amazing. You also have to try their mango smoothie.  Adam the owner goes out of his way to remember your name and offer 5 star customer service. That's the way it should be. My wife and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Apparently if you leave this place a review that is not a 5 star then it's fake or vindictive. But seriously for a small mediocre cup of coffee for $3.... this place is not getting a 5 star review. I didn't get to try their breakfast or other pasties aside from the croissant I got, which was just alright. Nothing to write home about. I feel like their prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Best blueberry muffin I ever have. The other pastries are amazing too. They have a private room for tea too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast/bakery place! Perfect croissants, delicious pastries, awesome breakfasts - we've tried several (eg. egg boat, brioche French toast) and all have been great! Family owned and operated and the they treat everyone like friends."}
{"text":"Very good!  Very clean and the food was good. The customer service was amazing.  Great coffee I hope they do well and stay open in the evenings so kids can go do homework."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. I love their fresh made croissants. Family run and friendly environment. Stop by and try some of the fresh baked goodies."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Food and service was less than mediocre. My husband, mother and I all ordered breakfast sandwiches. They ordered the same sandwich and I got a different one. Somehow all of our sandwiches were exactly the same with the exception of a puny piece of sausage and bacon on the side with mine. Which was actually supposed to be on the sandwich. Each sandwich was accompanied by about 5 potatoes and the most bland Greek salad I've ever had. Everything tasted like it was pulled straight from the frozen section of frys and microwaved. Yet it took almost 25 minutes to get our food; no silverware, no condiments, no salt and pepper. Coffee was served luke warm and I had to get up and bring my cup across the room to where the cream and sugar were. Just a very weird, Uninviting setup. Nobody asked how we were, how the food was, or if we needed anything. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service!!!!  Adam treats all of his customers like family. Serves bakery delicacies that cant be found anywhere else in AZ! Coming here every time I want to eat. Amazing vibe and atmosphere. I never yelp but this was def worth it! Will be back for croissants tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service here is phenomenal the food is a little piece of heaven. I had the \"soup of the day\" fresh tomato basil with toasted panini bread. Not to mention a calming, relaxing, festive environment. I was able to have brunch and complete all of my Christmas cards for family. I felt like I was sitting in the comfort of my own home."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been eagerly waiting for this place to open. I was immediately greeted by the owner Adam who happily walked us through their process here. He stated they start at 2 in the morning and bake everything fresh. Anything that isn't used throughout the day is donated to the food bank. They have what they call a soft opening with a limited menu option. But even with that there's plenty to choose from so I didn't feel as though I had to settle on my breakfast choice. I ordered a vanilla latte and due to the opening they had ran out of vanilla but the owner came by and said no worries I'll have the chef in the back make some fresh vanilla from the beans we have and and get that into your latte. Food was very good service is great owner goes out of his way not sure what else you can ask for from a restaurant. Definitely going to be returning soon."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, Gyro was great as were the salads. Owner was super nice and made our birthday visit really fun. The croissants were outstanding. Looking forward to coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love EarlyBaker!  The owners and staff are so friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  And the food is so good!  I have gone for breakfast many times and tried different breakfast items on the menu--all so very good!  I've had lunch a couple of times--also so very good.  

The food is made with the finest ingredients.....real butter, imported chocolate and more.  It is also made with lots of love and it's obvious.  Desserts are beautiful and are displayed beautifully too.

EarlyBaker isn't a chain restaurant, so don't expect chain-restaurant quality food or prices.  You can tell from the outside that this is a unique place to dine....it's open and light and very welcoming.  I feel comfortable going in here by myself because I usually run into a friend; and if I don't, I am comfortable reading my book and enjoying a cappuccino or iced tea.

OH!....they also have patio dining, so it's dog friendly.  And with the nice weather upon us, bring a book or some friends and a deck of cards and enjoy the outdoors.

EarlyBaker....welcome to Ahwatukee!  I'm glad you're here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and had them cater my daughters baby shower. The service and food all 3 times was excellent!  The owner, Adam, took time to help me choose the perfect food for the shower and I received so many compliments at the event.  While dining in their beautiful restaurant, I enjoyed the Greek salad and hummus!  I shared a lemon bar with my sister for desert, yummy!  My other sister, who is vegan, asked many questions that were answered patiently and she was delighted with their Tomato Basil soup!  Each visit has been wonderful!  Thank you Early Baker!"}
{"text":"We have visited Early Baker twice, it is awesome. The coffee is delicious and the croissants are the best ever. The chocolate or almond croissant are so flaky, crispy and delicious.
You will not be disappointed if you visit."}
{"text":"Went by Saturday night to check their dessert offerings. We indulged in their chocolate ganache like truffles each at $2 and took home their chocolate croissant and coconut macaroon. I didn't expect everything we bought to be excellent but it was! Everything is made fresh daily.
Adam, the owner, was very personable. They also bake their own gluten free pita creation so I look forward to trying a pita gyros or other soon. Nice meeting room for birthday parties, Moms lunch etc. Recommended ! Currently open until 9 pm most nights too!"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  The food is made from scratch.  I had brioche french toast, with what tasted like homemade syrup and fresh whipped cream that was so thick it was almost like clotted cream.  It was absolutely fabulous.  Good portion size, good prices.  I highly recommend.  Next time, we'll try for lunch!"}
{"text":"For starters this is walking distance for us. Secondly, the fresh made food is beyond what I've ever expected it to be. It takes a bit longer for the food but quality takes time. The staff is very friendly and on top of coffee refills. Every dish has been throughly enjoyed by my husband and myself everytime. The bakery is worth a visit alone. Try the lemon bars! The French macaroons are so full of flavor! Any visitors we've had we always bring in and they leave loving Early Baker and can't wait to return. There is so much to enjoy so it's best to figure it out on your own over time. Forgot to mention the house made vanilla flavor for the coffee...yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're looking for fabulous baked goods, a warm and cozy local place and owners who stand by their food, than this is the place for you! The best croissants in AZ are right here; had the plain and chocolate which is to die for especially when heated up! The cream puffs and eclairs especially are just amazing. The cream filling tastes fresh, light and creamy and the Belgian chocolate on top is the perfect sweetness. We had a taste of their Japanese cheesecake, why, because I asked about it and the owner(the baker herself) let us try it. It was very light and airy, different than NY cheesecake of course, but deli inns different way.

The best so far is their brioche French toast; OMG Snooze, watch out. We were talking about Snooze and how delicious theirs was but Adam challenged us to try his. He was right, his is better! Fluffy brioche bread, homemade syrup, creme fraiche, bananas and strawberries. The look on my son's face was priceless (wish I took a Picture). 

What makes these delicious are the ingredients and the fact that the owner/baker knows what she's doing! I love the passion for their food and Adam's conviction that theirs is the best! If not, he says he'll give you your money back. That has not happened to us so we're heading there today for breakfast!  No, it's not cheap but the quality of the food is what you're paying for. We love the neighborhood feel and the fact that we're supporting a local independent venture!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo cute and the croissants were amazing!!! Will have to come by to try breakfast and lunch!!"}
{"text":"I found this place while working. The food is fresh and some of the best I've had, especially for the price. The service was great. Very authentic. They are first responder and military friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! You can taste the difference high quality ingredients make. I've tried everything from the Turkey Pesto to assorted baked goods and have never been disappointed. It's my go-to place when I need something to bring to clients or office potlucks. Plus the owners are some of the most gracious and welcoming small business owners I've ever met."}
{"text":"Cute clean place. Breakfast all day. Had the turkey crepe and the Nutella crepe. Both are excellent. Also had the chocolate croissant and got two to go. The owner Adam adds to the experience he was friendly kind and humorous."}
{"text":"Four stars only because the portions are rather small for the price you pay for them. The service was good, seems like a family operation so I can always respect that. Real nice location and a perfect spot to park yourself out in the patio and enjoy the beautiful weather rolling in. Steak and eggs were delish..."}
{"text":"Kiana made a baptism cake for our son's special day and it was absolutely amazing.  They were so easy to work with and we were so impressed.   She listened carefully and accommodated our food allergies. I highly recommend Early Baker for any special occasion cake."}
{"text":"Food was really great! I had the Early Steak & Eggs and it was tasty! It came with a nice Mediterranean-style side salad that balanced the plate out perfectly. The patio was nice and clean and the ambiance was very relaxed."}
{"text":"Great service, pretty decent food, expensive for what you get. I came here on a Sunday morning and it wasn't jam packed which was nice. We ordered the \"American breakfast\" I believe, which was an egg sandwich with turkey bacon and seasoned potatoes ($10.95 with juice as a separate charge). This meal was okay, not too much seasoning which I expected more of as this place has a very distinct flair to it. I might come back again to try something else as I feel they may excel in other areas. Aside from the food, the decor and ambiance is great, they also have a gorgeous private eating area for larger groups."}
{"text":"Good experience for our first visit. Came here 8am and sat on the beautiful patio with my dog child. Perfect place if you want a quiet relaxing morning with your pet and a cup of coffee. Very clean and a very friendly young man behind the counter. Only 4 stars because the price of our very basic egg sandwiches. 32$ for two plates and two coffees. I would recommend a pastry and coffee."}
{"text":"The best croissant I've eaten this side of Paris. Excellent blueberry muffin.  I'll be back for a dull breakfast. Try the cinnamon butter.  Good, local, family run joint.  Really nice peiple running the place."}
{"text":"Exemplary customer service and my cappuccino was excellent, but everyone's breakfast was very bland. It's nothing a little seasoning, maybe a little salt and pepper, couldn't help but it needs something. We all had eggs, I had a frittata, and e everyone found their breakfast to be bland. The man at the counter was delightful and personable and made sure we had everything we needed. I hope they figure everything out and stay in business because it's a cute little place."}
{"text":"There are very few places in Ahwatukee that serve excellent breakfast and lunch, but now we have Early Baker. So far I have visited them three times and never been disappointed with my order or beverages. The last time I went it was with a group that required their back meeting room where I was able to sit comfortably, and enjoy their famous crepes and coffee. I would have taken a picture if I didn't think it would disrupt the meeting.  The other two times I tried their breakfast frittata and chocolate croissants, and all of it is excellent. Like the food the service is always excellent and super friendly."}
{"text":"Really nice mom and pop shop with a warm atmosphere and really nice ambiance. They're food is good too, very unique recipes."}
{"text":"This is a must for incredible middle eastern type food. Super fresh and amazing flavors. The owners are incredibly friendly and the staff very pleasant and attentive. I typically don't like stuffed grape leaves but these are the best I have ever had. Prices are very reasonable and portions generous."}
{"text":"I had a delightful first time official visit at the Early Baker.  We were a large group so they put us In a private dining room.  We felt right at home!  Adam the owner was prompt at taking our food selections and memorized our names (17 of them).  I had their almond croissant once so l knew they had top quality baked goods (a friend brought us their croissants once). Today l had their mango smoothie, it was delicious! Ron had a plain croissant, rich in buttery flavors, big, fluffy and flaky.  In no particular order our group picked French Toasts, Lemon crepes, steak & egg, baked egg dish and a large dish of other pastries.  The big winner is... The Lemon Crepe! Oui, oui. Crepe oozes with a vibrant lemon cream, topped with lemond curd (l think).  Next runner up is the French Toast, a thick homemade brioche smothered in syrup. There were a few Turkish coffees at our table.  It smelled like cardamom and that enticing dark roast Arabica coffee grain. I skipped their coffee today as l had already infused my body with caffeine in the early morning.  The \"steak\" and eggs is in fact a roast beef. One of our friends at the table would not have ordered it knowing this.  I'm confident that Early Baker will edit this erroneous description promptly.
We paid for our breakfast at the counter. In return we were handed a card with 20% off at our next visit! I found Early Baker to be an outstanding new addition to Ahwatukee.  I took a look at their showcased pastries (watch my video), and l was very impressed by their pastry chef' skills. It looks like the perfect bakery to order a custom cake for a special event.  We were all very pleased and enthused.  Bravo Early Baker"}
{"text":"Terrible overall experience maybe an understatement. Here we go... My wife and I ordered at the counter and a somewhat unlikeable character took our order. He seemed bothered we had even shown up. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and regular drip coffee, my wife ordered a spinach pastry and a cookie. We paid. Received only a cookie and a table #. No coffee. Sat down at a table. Salt and pepper shakers were empty. No silverware and no one brought any over. After 5 minutes, I had to ask for my coffee. It's was brought over with no sugar, cream or spoon. Coffee was definitely water downed w hot water. Not a fresh brew. Worst coffee I've ever had. After about 10-15 minutes I received my amateur hour sandwich. The menu stated it as fresh baked bread. What I received was a panini sandwich w a microwaved egg inside. The bread was white bread with no butter heated up in a panini maker. It was a top 5 worst meal of my whole life. The topper was my wife received her spinach pasty last after about 20 minutes. When we asked for it, he said they were \"freshly making\" it. When it came out, it was clearly a microwaved pastry that was still cold in the middle. We couldn't leave this place fast enough. 
Do us all a favor and either hire a competent restaurant manager or shut this down until you figure it out. Embarrassing to have a breakfast place like this in Tukee. Never again..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the owner of this place is amazing and friendly. I stopped in for a coffee (which is locally roasted BTW.... A step up as compared to most coffee options in Ahwatukee) and the owner gave me a bunch of cookies to share with my students.... That was totally unexpected and so generous! I'll be back soon to try their food (and other pastries) , which looks amazing. Definitely check this new restaurant out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent food and Excellent people!

We were told by friends to try this place out while we were visiting Arizona. They said they had great coffee...THAT THEY DO! And homemade vanilla syrup to put in it (or drink...whatever you decide ;). The owners are fabulous! They make everything from scratch and OMG is it delicious. We had the eggs on a boat, brioche French toast, and a chocolate croissant....um YUM! 

We quite possibly might go back for breakfast everyday while we are here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took guests for lunch at the Early Baker. The food is fresh and delicious. I had a crepe and my husband and friends had paninis. We all enjoyed our meals. We liked it so much that we returned another day during our friend's' visit. We sat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the beautiful weather. I like having a breakfast menu all day. The pastries in the case look good, too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great ppl and great food. Loved the owner/manager. Super nice guy."}
