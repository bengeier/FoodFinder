{"text":"This is our first time here and we were very impressed! The variety available was way beyond our expectations. The service was very good and the decor is charming. The prices are very good, too!"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, we tried this place for dinner. What seems apparent is that the reviews are based on something other than the food quality; the waitress was very friendly and helpful, and the interior pleasantly rustic. However, I was served the house special spaghetti after being told it was fantastic. Really odd, pasta with some tomatoes and other vegetables mixed in, covered with cheese, and apparently baked. Not very tasty. We won't be going back. Perhaps our experience was atypical, or perhaps the customers who regularly eat there, and who post reviews, have very different impressions of what is acceptable."}
{"text":"Friendly, casual atmosphere. Very clean, well organized and wide variety of delicious foods. Fresh, crisp cold salads, generous portions for every dish we've tried so far. Many more to go. Wonderful related atmosphere, blazing hot fire and terrific waitstaff."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, once for lunch, once for dinner. Food is decent, nothing out of this world but solid and affordable. The best thing i've had their is the chicken and dumplings soup. Service was pretty good. Definitely family friendly & no booze is sold there. Lots of Animal heads on walls so if that bothers you, I wouldn't dine in."}
{"text":"I love this little family restaurant. The staff is very nice and the food is delicious for a very reasonable price. After having a fantastic dinner, I decided to have Angelo's cater for our wedding of 52 guests. Helen, the owner, personally stayed to make sure everything was set up on time and everything went smoothly. The catering dishes were elegant and the food was a hit! I would go back to Angelo's anytime!"}
{"text":"so very disappointed tasteless frozen food with bottled sauces and dressings. poor service, totally apathetic servers how do they stay open?! dirty, old decor, claim to Greek but the gyro was frozen meat and stale pita  southern cooking western decor Italian sign but Greek name - wow"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Parmesan and found the spaghetti was thick and overcooked, the chicken Parmesan was too thick and the sauce was not very good!  My husband order a gyro & only got three slices of lamb & more salad.  The Suzuki sauce was not good."}
