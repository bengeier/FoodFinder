{"text":"always good tasty food on the go at this place and the staff are always really good. Its also very child friendly with a wee bit up the back for them to play. However thanks to the black curly hair in my pasta its 1 mark off."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant opposite from Guidis. I believe both restaurants are owned by the same people; however, Dimmagios is definitely not as good as Guidis, the menu is only slightly different but the quality is far less. Staff are friendly and you don't have to wait for long to eat, but I would still recommend you go to the guidis, just across the street."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my night out here. Staff were pleasant but food was awful. My starter Di Maggio's Bad Ass Wings were just bad, cold and fatty and although my Pasta dish was at least edible it had just been slopped on a plate. No presentation whatsoever. On a plus point it has a good sized menu with lots of choice although I wont be rushing back to try it. Prices are not bad and decor is nice enough but sadly quality of food just really lets this place down."}
{"text":"Dimaggios is across the road fro Guidis so if either are busy it's easy to cross the road and try the other one for a table. Both serve similar food but I think Guidis food is nicer (and more expensive). You can view the menu online - I recommend the pizzas in particular - these have always been really tasty. You can also book your table online too. If you're stuck for a gift idea, they also do gift vouchers which can be used in any of their restaurants. The staff are nice and friendly and always make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"After being here for 5 weeks himself, my husband had weeded out the places that he liked and that offered an ample enough menu that he thought I would be able to find something l liked and that was vegetarian.  Unfortunately, this left mostly chain restaurants.    Regardless, DiMaggio's was decent.  We came here after an exhausting day of sightseeing.  I re-energized on some onion rings and the pizza verde, which was very good and had a bit of a spicy kick to it.  It is also a thinner crust, so not too filling.  For dessert, I had the toffee ice cream, which I also enjoyed.  Like most chain restaurants, DiMaggio's was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Definitely A-OK.  The one thing I have a slight issue with, as an American, is the wait service at all restaurants in Scotland.  You don't seem to have a dedicated waiter/waitress.  We had 3-4 people taking care of us at DiMaggio's, including someone who appeared to be the manager.  Nonetheless, everything came out correctly and in reasonable time."}
{"text":"Just tried to order a delivery from here which I have done on a few occasion previously. I tried using my work laptop, my iphone, my own laptop and a tablet to order and the page either crashed or wouldn't let me click on any items. When I finally got through the process to payment I didn't see anywhere to pay with gift vouchers even though they can be paid online or in house. Called Di Maggios and got someone that had no idea and asked me to pay the remainder of the balance with cash or change my order so it was less than the voucher amount and collect to save the cost going over it. I am left frustrated and wondering how one of my electronic devices didn't end up out a window but have ordered from somewhere else now. Such a shame."}
