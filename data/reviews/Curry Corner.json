{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant and it was an excellent experience. Coming from the Bay Area we are seasoned pakiindo food eaters. This food however is the best desi food we have ever tasted. The best part was seeing my pre teen kids enjoying the food. We ordered the wings, chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, chicken boti. I am coming again to Phoenix, just to eat here"}
{"text":"My meat was dry again. When you order a drink, they give you a cup and point you to the coke machine, so service is not this place is style. Apache Blvd has become a middle eastern mecca of food, so they will have to shape up or ship out, since better and less expensive delights are all down the street."}
{"text":"Best chicken tikka masala, nice and spicy. I order the garlic naan. My husband gets the biryani  and he's always happy with it.  I used to eat inside but our last 4 visits my husband orders take out.  The owner's son (part owner?) is nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's close to campus for a good price and good portion sizes. I like their yummy Chicken Tikka Masala! They give you a good portion sizes. The other dishes were pretty good, samosas were ok, their curry is tasty and the food isn't that spicy. Super love their tikka masala fries. Yeah, I said tikka masala fries!   They're currently undergoing renovations to make the place a bit bigger and it's needed since it can get busy and full."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place frequently for the last 1 and half years and the food was great until recently.  The last few times I ordered take out food and I always find the curries highly diluted with water, samosas fried in old oil and their signature biriyani not flavorful at all.  The last time I ordered take out food from there, I even found a piece of meat in my veggie curry!!   Like others have mentioned, the service is poor, the place is highly understaffed and not so friendly staff either.  The place used to be known for its flavorful, cheap food but sadly the quality has degraded over the last few months..."}
{"text":"Great food!  There was just the small problem of forgetting that my girlfriend and myself were sitting in the restaurant. After watching everyone else receive their food (after entering 30+ minutes after us) I decided to enter passive aggressive stare mode with the host.  My non verbal cues were apparently on point and we then received our food with a very brief explanation on how our food was sent to another table minus the apology.  I'd recommend curry corner as long as you don't care for service or an immediate appetite."}
{"text":"So, the other day my friend and I wanted to go and have Cantonese food down the street from this place, but they were closed for an ASU welcome back dinner; wack!! So, I scrammed to find a yummy place last minute on Yelp which was in the area, and Curry Corner popped up.  I am very happy that he and I went to this place after all. Since I am doing a physical and spiritual cleanse at this time and cannot eat meat, dairy, processed sugar, sweets, breads/white flour products, this place made me happy.   I had their veggie combination and was blown away by how well delectable they can make chic peas and spinach taste with their spices and techniques.   I am going back when I can eat meat and bread and will enjoy their fish/chicken dishes and supposedly amazing naan.  I am a fan!  Love, The East Coast Foodie"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for Mother's Day. As a vegan myself I am always unsure in any restaurant but the staff here put my mind to ease and helped me find a few menu items I could eat. The daal tasted great with a nice spiciness to it, and I'm told the beef tikka masala was delicious too. Not only was the food great, the prices were too! Would most certainly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is about as good a place I've found in a while. From the fluffy perfectly baked naans to the rich curries with cuts of meat that remind one of what meat is supposed to be like, I've enjoyed everything I've tried here. From what I could make out this is a smallish family-run place (with a warm friendliness to match), but it seems to be expanding a bit. The decor is simple, as is the service - you get your own drinks and order at the counter - but that stuff is unimportant. What is really important is the quality, and this place delivers in every way.  If you like (north) Indian food, you'll find yourself at home - the spices and preparations are similar, though perhaps a little richer, and the names are different. And based on the Indian places I've seen in Phoenix, this place is far superior. I particularly recommend the Beef Achari, which was the first thing I tried there; I do want to try a biryani and see how that it, so watch this space for updates.  In short, if you want an awesome dining experience on a very reasonable budget, this is one of the best places you'll find, I guarantee."}
{"text":"The best Indian/Pakistani Restaurant and one of the best in Phoenix, no doubt about it. One way this restaurant stands out is that it does not serve buffet atypical from other Indian places. So the food is made just for you. The lady who runs the place cooks most of the food and her passion exudes in her cooking. I usually order goat/lamb Karachi with Tawa paratha and hardly ever have I been disappointed and I have been eating here since 2013. Service is quick and quicker during lunch. Price is set for students and so 12 dollars will get you two meals worth of food. This restaurant would be a stand-out even in highly ethnic and diverse eatery locations such as Philadelphia and New York and I should know coz I am from there."}
{"text":"Curry Corner is an instant classic, an all around go-to for great food.   My wife and I had a date night last night, we were both were hungry for Indian cuisine and Curry Corner was on our minds. We had seen reviews and articles about the restaurant and couldn't wait to try. We did and we loved it!   Excellent food and service. I'm not sure I could have asked for anything more than what was delivered."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic. Prices are reasonable. I don't eat this type of food much at all but I will now and Ill drive here to get it."}
{"text":"The food from Curry Corner is good but the service is pretty bad and their attitude is very racist... They treat the white Americans as Roman Gods and the people from the subcontinent and Mexico as the slaves... They will treat you as if they were your boss if you are anywhere from Asia... So if you are looking for quite tasty food (at somewhat higher but okay price) but bad behavior from the owners you are very welcome."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that can convince our 8-year old daughter that goat is her new favorite meat is serving really superb dishes. These folks are masterful in building complex and distinct flavors, some spicy and others mild, but all melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We drove 1200 miles from Portland, Oregon to visit family, knowing all the while we couldn't leave Phoenix before coming to eat here. We're so glad we did, and can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"I questioned ordering them at first but the Tika masala fries are great! I also almost always order the tandoori chicken because it is charred to perfection and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Indian/Pakistani food.Very kind welcoming hosts, very affordable,do yourselves a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place a better review but the service is always so terrible. When you call up to order out they hang up immediately after taking the order without telling you how long it will take to make or even saying thank you or goodbye. If you eat in, there is always the same lone miserable looking server there who wants as little to do with the customer's happiness as possible.   Apart from that, the food is very tasty. I have had a variety of chicken curries and grilled chicken and they were all very tasty. Also good is the Aloo Gobi. The hummus and samosa are great too."}
{"text":"The staff is very rude and are always in a rush to get off the phone , I live in queen creek and I drive about 35 min to get to Tempe and il always order more than $70 , and top it off anytime I ask the gentleman to make sure food is sealed and rapped he always gives me an attitude as if I'm irrelevant , I understand that the food is decent but doesn't mean you get to treat your customers  in a poor manner, this is the not first time this has happened and not the first time I have had a interaction with this individual . I think it has come to a point where I will fine another place to eat ...... so sad the owner is a nice lady but this guy is ruining there business ,"}
{"text":"Food is great but their servers are often rude and poorly trained. From soggy old masala fries, cold shoulder treatment, to being handed the menus at the door with a \"can you do me a favor and take this with you.\"   If the food was not so good they would have closed shop years ago. As competition grows from copper kettle next door, service must dramatically improve or customers will be fed up."}
{"text":"This place not the best looking inside, but the food is awesome and authentic! The service can be a little slow because it is almost always very crowded, but the waits aren't unbearable. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan. My boyfriend had another chicken dish with rice. It was flavorful but the Naan was the best part. If you like spicy food make sure to ask for it though! They keep it non-spicy unless you ask because there's a lot of wimpy white people who complain about it being too hot otherwise lol!"}
{"text":"So good. It can get pretty busy. My favorite thing to do is to just order a bunch of dishes to go since I can get a little crowded in there sometimes. The naan and the chicken marsala is so yummy."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. Awesome soft garlic naan. I had the goat karahi and it was delicious. Looked like mom was in charge in the kitchen too. A lot of local indians dining in as well. A good sign. Big ole cup of steaming chai too. I'm hooked. Decore sucks but who cares? It's all about the food. I will return despite the 20 minute bus ride from my hotel."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for more than a year now since i moved to AZ , had couple of incidents with them where they gave me the wrong order or my order will be missing sth , i told them about it and they didn't do anything about it This time i ordered the mixed grill, yummy stuff, but it wasn't cooked right, the chicken was raw   I gave up on this place  I don't recommend this place for customers who are looking for consistency in food and service"}
{"text":"Bland food. Serving bad. The guy serving was so irritated when asked for refills. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"First time I went with an indian couple and the felt that it was the best Indian food they had outside of India. It was delish... cant recomend the mixed tandoori enough."}
{"text":"They have the best rice! I love their curry! I like rice."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time with my SO last Tuesday(Mar 17th). When we walked in, there were a bunch of people standing awkwardly in the door and then someone came by to seat us. The table was dirty, so the man quickly wiped it, but there were still crumbs all over it. It took about 10 minutes just to get drinks(a water and a coke). I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and it was trashed. While waiting for food, the phone kept ringing loudly for several minutes with no one answering it.            I got the Aloo Tikki first after about 15 minutes. It had small black specs and crumbles on it, which I wiped off. The favor was decent. The outside of the patties was luke warm, but the inside was definitely cold. The Palak paneer was decent flavor wise as well, but it only had 4 paneer cubes in the whole dish. My SO got the chicken and rice. The flavor of the chicken was really good but I got a gangly piece was was turned off from eating more chicken. I'm not sure what is used to flavor the rice, since after a few bites I couldn't justify taking the rest home(which I am very much against throwing food away if I can help it). I enjoy trying new foods, so I am used to ethnic flavors, but something wasn't right about the chicken and rice.          My SO and I did agree that the Naan was really good. Unfortunately, I don't think that is enough for a sit down return (maybe just take out for the naan). I was so disappointed with this experience, since I was expecting it really good based on reviews and the pretty attractive pictures on the website."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Funny they have tvs in the restaurant with it on the food network and when I was there Curry Corner was on Diner Dives and drive-ins.  I have since been there many times and tried more then just the chicken.  The tilki massala fries are so good mmm I am getting hungry right now."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this for a long time and finally made it in! I am not at all familiar with Indian/Pakistani food so I can't remember what I had, but it was delicious! A friend got the masala fries which were to die for."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who love this place, but I don't get it.  They are going to be featured on the food network as having the beset chicken tikka masala.  I ordered this twice (thinking maybe the first time it was an off day) but it was horrible each time.  Not tender or tasty.   The goat tastes like lamb and has that grassy taste.  And the Nan's are served on these plastic trays, where they don't change the foil between customers!   Bathroom is filthy.  Lots of college students eat here, and it is in walking distance of ASU's campus.  It's not even that cheap.    I must be missing something, because I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had their chicken biryani today, the chicken was not cooked properly at all. I am already sick. Always had good experience but I think they should change their cooking quality. Highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Its good , midrange , indian/Pakistani restaurant. If you haven't tried this cosine before then its extra plus for trying without spending a small fortune. Ask for the Garlic Naan = garlic bread , as long you don't plan in kissing someone for the next few hours."}
{"text":"Love this place. Simple cheap food though sometimes the service can be a little slow. I definitely go back any time I crave some good India food."}
{"text":"Ive never been a huge fan of indian food. This place may have changed my mind. Dont be fooled by the location its alot nicer on the inside then it appears from the parking lot. The staff was really nice and the pricing was very reasonable. 4 entrees and 2 appetizers for 40 bucks. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service is extremely poor. No one to receive the customers. I waited for nearly 10 minutes for nothing on my table for nothing. No one to take order or even provide water.  Had to walk out. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Like the food here. It has that \"home cooked.. by mom\"  taste. Their non veg thali is the best and so is the biriyani. I gave a star less for this place for 2 reasons... they do not know how to season the food.. too little salt and the guys attending you could be rude and intimidating. They could learn how to treat customers well. But if you think only about food..its a good place."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and reasonably priced. I've been going here when they were in their super small location. My only con is the service. Their water isn't filtered. They don't have enough staff members to handle all their business, both phone orders and dining room.   If you are going to come, just go in knowing that you will be in for a long wait (1.5 to 2 hours) and relax with whoever you'll be going with. This goes for takeout too, I've seen people wait for awhile for their food.  That said, I highly recommend their hummus appetizer, best hummus I've ever had. I love all their Thali plates. Their masala is so yummy. I've had it with chicken and fish, and I really love it with fish.   In the end it is worth the wait, but if the service could tighten up it would be such a better atmosphere. Such a shame to sit there listening to new people gripe about the wait and then shut up once it finally comes stuffing their face.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Curry Corner is a Tempe Gem. Tucked away in a little strip right off of the light rail, the ambiance is cozy and lovely. I love the Chicken Tikka Masala, Biranyi and Naan. Fresh, perfect level of spiciness and flavor. We are excited to continue making our way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"Okay.  This review will lack details on my end.   I must have been mentally exhausted that day to not to have retained many specifics.  My g/f and I wanted lunch near our office and had seen Curry Corner but neither of us had ever been before.   It was suspect from the outside but I've learned never to judge a book by its cover. We arrived way before the lunch crowd so the place was empty when we entered.  The decor was okay (sorry didn't really pay much attention) from what I remember.  We decided on a booth since all the spots were open.    On to my next lack of detail.  I don't remember the name of the entree that I ordered.  But I ordered it since it was the closest thing to saag paneer that I could find.  I was not disappointed.  (My younger self would be amazed that I would ever look forward and enjoy eating something that looked that questionable, if you know what I mean).  It was absolutely delicious!! I also ordered a potato naan (guess I really wanted carbs that day) and was also very good.   The service was good.  And by the time we finished our lunch the place was totally full.  The dish my g/f ordered was not what she had visualized but she said it was absolutely delish.    Since it's very close to our job, we will keep this place in mind when venturing out for lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food. Affordable and casual. Very helpful advise with the menu. We will be back"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have EVER had! I will definitely go there again and try more dishes. I believe it will not let you down."}
{"text":"As a foodie and lover of tasty spicy (cause spicy bland exists) food, Curry Corner has to rank as one of my favorite places to eat, simply for the quality of the food. Can't believe it took me so long to find this place! The Lamb Karahi with extra chili is by far my favorite dish."}
{"text":"The mutter paneer was good. It was not the best I have ever had but good. I like this place, the prices are reasonable, the food is tasty and the people are nice. The naan that came with the meal was ok, next time I will have to order garlic naan. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First visit at Curry Corner four different dishes lamb- chicken naan it was  As advertised fabulous  the only way a really Resturant review can b written is by eating at the Curry Corner   Competition resturants Dont write reviews work at ur own place make ur food better Thank u Curry Corner Manno"}
{"text":"The food is really good. We like their food but the waiting time is too long and it kills the pleasure. People come later than us finish sooner. Twenty minutes is ok but we waited for over forty minutes. The last plate was not here after a whole hour so we had to cancel it."}
{"text":"Chicken in the Tikka Massala was dark meat which I don't care for. It was a bit grissly. Taste was fair and naan was fair also"}
{"text":"I took some friends here tonight after regrettably not making reservations at the dhaba, which we love.   This was by far the worst Indian food we have ever had.  We have had take out here once before that wasn't great but tolerable.  Tonight our samosas were cold in the middle and the Palak paneer and aloo paneer tasted like tomato paste and peas with no spice.   The chole dish I had was ok, but my friends food came out nearly 30 minutes after mine and it was awful.  We also didn't get our garlic naan until almost the end of the meal and it was flavorless.  They did apologize for the food and the \"new\" cook and did end up comping our meal, kudos to them for that.   But we did leave hungry and disappointed.  Definitely will not be returning.  Next time will be sure to make reservations in time at The Dhaba!"}
{"text":"Nice affordable place for students. Liked their chicken delicacies. The vegetarian food is OK, little bland actually. But the chicken is good, especially the biryani.  Also their simple dal tadka is a staple for when you don't wanna cook much. Just get this as a to go and cook some plain rice! Simple yet sumptuous, and easy on the students' pocket! PS. Tikka masala fries is the underdog here!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food, large portions, and a solid price.  Some of the best chicken tikka masla I've ever had.  I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Excellent. Had the chicken tikki, great! If you like Indian food, you have to go here!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. The chicken tikka masala is top notch, the take out is super convenient and fast. Samosas are fantastic. Definitely worth going to if you're a fan of Indian food."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  It definitely was a dive.  Our host was blowing his nose in a tissue very often.  Doubt he washed his hands.  Our curry goat had a hair in it.  The samosas were cold in the middle.  They did apologize,  but still had item on bill.  I will not go there again.  Beware false advertising.  Although to be fair I didn't give the food real chance.  It was hard for me to stomach.  My wife enjoyed the tandoori chicken."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant after reading all the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. My friends and I were a bit apprehensive because we are not exactly Indian food connoisseurs but the server helped us order our dishes and we were very pleased with what we got. All the curry was delicious and it had the perfect amount of spice to it, just enough to make you reach for the water but not too much that you lose the taste of the food. The naan was delicious and the portions were perfect for sharing with the whole party. I think we had the chicken makhani, chicken tikka masala, one of their goat specials, and the vegetarian thali plate which was a big sample plate of a bunch of different foods. Oh and it doesn't get better than only paying around $8 per person and being so full you can barely move. Let's just say I am jealous of everyone at ASU who can frequent this restaurant on a regular basis."}
{"text":"People don't go to this Resturant. Beware!! Most dishonest owner and workers I have ever seen. Food had hairs in them. Insisted refund one person named Sakib (cashier) said he will refund the money but I need to speak with the owner. Owner is a lady by the name Biren or Viren evaded (hang up)my calls when I reached her over the phone. Sheer lie and deception. Some other worker answered the next call, said the owner had left the store. Terrible experience, will report to BBB for unsanitary food handling and deceptive tactic"}
{"text":"If you want good service and a dining \"experience\", don't go here.  If you want to taste deliciously balanced Pakistani/Indian food, go here...now.  Oh, and you can byob. Liquor store on the corner."}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal and I loved the tikka masala fries. The Paneer masala and garlic naans were so tasty.   It's a small place and the service was good.."}
{"text":"Went to eat there and had a craving for it but was completely disappointed. The food was cold and the flavors were tasteless. the food was 2 days old and was not fresh. We got sick  the next day. Loved it in the past and always referred it to many of our friends. will not return."}
{"text":"I go to this place regularly. Even witnessed it take the turn to fame before it was anything at all.  Any who,  if the store owners truly do read this, please know that chicken Tikka massala is supposed to be made by using chicken breasts! Not thighs or whatever part of the chicken you put in there. Every time I make that order I get  many uncooked chicken pieces in my meal and it's an appetite killer I tell ya. Please make the effort to satisfy this long time customer by handing me well-cooked chicken, chicken cooked all the way through... That type of chicken,  like chicken breasts, would go fantastic with the brilliant masalla sauce."}
{"text":"Menu is extensive. Food was YUM.  The place was packed, so it took a bit for the food to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular here. after hearing so any different people recommend this strip mall curry joint, I had to try it, just to stop the looks of surprise that I had not been. food was excellent. cute interior. professional staff. charging for naan makes me sad, but worth it. now I find myself considering this a default option when considering where to eat. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Straight to the point their food is delicious and deserves 4 stars, but their service is awful/ disappointing. I honestly even wish their food wasn't so good. I've come in on multiple occasions and the waiter/waitresses have been so rude. On one occasion when I asked for water while I waited for my to-go the waitress with a lot of makeup on was talking badly about me in spanish. Awkward considering I understand/speak Spanish. It was to the point where I felt uncomfortable eating there. Service is slow and it's to the point where I feel I need to write this review."}
{"text":"The smells coming out of here are great; overall it was a good experience albeit it for a bittersweet goodbye dinner to friends.   We started with the tikka fries; while I wouldn't choose them over chili cheese fries they are a nice change if pace. I was also amazed at how the fries stayed crispy while being slathered in sauce.   I had the goat haleem, purely out of curiosity and a desire to try the most widely consumed meat in the wold. It is a type of lentil and goat puréed soup served rice. While it was delicious, I would have preferred more actual meat as opposed to the few pieces I got.   Naan was also good but I don't know that I have ever had bad naan."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews a few of us at work decided to give this place a try.  We like spicy food and asked the waitress to give us the spiciest version of chicken tikka masala available.  What they gave us was clearly from their premade pot in the back with some chili flakes on top.  The flavor itself was bland, and the spicy flakes made no difference.  None of us came close to finishing our meals.  Terrible."}
{"text":"I have been going to Curry Corner since it was a small joint near the campus.  They have come a long way. Easily the best Indian/Pakistani/Middle-Eastern food in the Phoenix area. Very friendly staff and excellent service. Their grilled items are a must-try!"}
{"text":"Been sitting here for 5 mins. No one came to us, I had to call the waiter to take our order. Within that a family of 3  just walked out after no one came to take their order. Terrible service. Very slow. The kitchen staff is so loud. They were screaming making us not concentrate on our conversation I was having with my family. The food was okay. Water was just nasty. Beware don't order there water! Last time we are coming here.  Came here thinking Guy came here, wanted to give it a shot but no way."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and it's a pretty good place. Good food, reasonable prices. Their customer service is alright and varies from day to day, once we came in at night and the customer service was pretty bad, but at other times it was good...should be consistent."}
{"text":"I have been looking for an entire year for good Paki/Indian places to eat in the valley but this place is my new favorite place where I'll be driving 40min to eat good home made food. Let me tell you..it's even better than food you will have in Pakistan. Mixed grill and korma masala was amazing. I had 2 mango lassi's in one setting including the best chai. I say the wait is long but the food is worth it. Going back there again very soon....everyone who likes indo/Paki food should go to this place and forget places like Tandoori Times, India Best or even Bombay Spice."}
{"text":"I left an earlier review about an experience I had in April of 2016 and how their service was horrible and had declined in the past couple of years. I hesitantly went back tonight because my sister was dying for some home (Pakistani) food and this is the only good place in town.  I was surprised by how much the service has improved. They've hired a new girl there who definitely understands customer service, some of the previous employees seem to be much better as well. I dont know if it was just by chance, but the owner was there taking orders as well, I havent seen that since 2013, but maybe thats because my visits have declined since then. Either way it seems the owner is really involved now, the service is much better than before. Our food came in under 15 minutes or so, though I noticed some tables waited quite a while, still not a problem. Final words, food is as great as it used to be, my stomach was more than satisfied and finally after a couple of years I was satisfied and happy to have gone there, and didnt feel like I was bothering them with my presence.   Only reason I didnt give it a 5 star was because I just want to make sure its like this the next time I go in and that it wasnt just a fluke, also there was a huge water leak on one side of our table from the ceiling which I thought was actually funny more than it was annoying lol. I think the recent negative yelp reviews have gotten them to straighten up, or maybe they've done it on their own. Definitely recommend that you go here for Pakistani/Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant numerous times and have always been fully satisfied from every aspect, taste, quantity, service and money. It is truly the biggest bang for the buck. The grilled menu, like the malai chicken, mixed grill, chicken tikka and chick boti are the best. In addition, their chicken biryani delivers a great taste to their rice menu. Tikka masala fries are something I have never heard of before until I tasted it at curry corner. It was amazing. I think this is something that they innovated. A glass of mango lussi (sweet mango yogurt shake) closes the deal.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yum,yum,yum! The hummus is wonderful and served with naan (any flavor you want) I have been there four times and each time was five star. Chicken tandoori is very tender and tasteful. Even the goat and lamb was superb. We were treated like kings & queens even though they were super busy. The parking is good once you maneuver around Apache blvd. God love the rail! I highly recommend it if you love indian/pakistani food. I have yet to try the deserts, always too full."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Curry Corner last weekend and were extremely disappointed. We often eat curry and have been to numerous Indian and Pakistani restaurants throughout the US and overseas and Curry Corner was by far the worst restaurant we've ever dined at. The food is mediocre at best and the service is extremely slow. We spent over 2 hours  there and the majority of the time was spent waiting for our food. It took more than 10 minutes for the waiter to bring water! Not to mention we waited more than 45 minutes for our halwa to be brought to us (which by the way was pre-made and only had to be microwaved).   While we were there we observed a family of 4 walk out and leave before their food had a chance to arrive. Additionally, we overheard a customer complain about the food, which was apparently so bad she wasn't even willing to try another item on the menu and wanted to pay and leave.   If you prefer to spend your money at an establishment with poor food, below average service and questionable cleanliness then Curry Corner is probably the place for you. I personally will not be returning to this establishment and will caution friends and associates against it."}
{"text":"Friendly Service and GREAT food.  The hummus and naan are awesome!  Such big portions on our entrees as well."}
{"text":"Good yummy food. We had chicken jalfrezi, hickey makhani, and paneer achari. Mango lassi was yum as usual. Paneer tikka may have been better choice than achari. Achari was good but had thin gravy."}
{"text":"I tried this place with a friend by accident today since there was a long wait for my fave Indian/pakastani resturant just down the street. At first the place seems like it may be a little dissappointing from it's fast food appearance (maybe it was because you have to order your food at the window?)     Don't let the appearance fool you the food is great! The Naan isn't the best i ever had but was good and the meal was excellent. prepare for SPICEY though. They don't skimp on spice for sure and they don't cook it to taste like some resturants I've been to. I loved it though and would definitly go back. The price is right too. Expect to pay abt $11 a person that's including your drink."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice and have loved it both times. I got the punjabi lamb handi and omg its amazing. The meat is so incredibly tender it just falls apart. The people were also really friendly and helpful. We never had Indian food before and our server made excellent suggestions and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We both loved the food and the service was good. The prices are very reasonable and our food came out pretty fast. We plan on bringing friends here and im pretty sure we are going to be regulars."}
{"text":"My workgroup came here for dinner. Standard hole in the wall decor. We found prices to be reasonable, our portions were way too much for one person. The chicken tikka wings were awesome, they also had tikka masala fries, something different unique never had it before but still tasted american flavor so didn't go well with the rest of the food. Also had nehari, lamb curry, and chicken handi, all good but nothing special."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Indian food I have ever had in my life! My husband said the same thing. Everything we had was just amazing and so flavorful and the prices are great!    We had the Fish Curry, Non veg tali (sp?) with this chickpea dish the waitress recommended, A mango lassi, and garlic naan. Everything was out of this world! So good! There was a curry that was on the tali plate that I had never heard of and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. The waitress told me the name, but I can't remember. She said it was a buttery flavored curry. The fish curry was excellent, the naan was the best I've ever had. And the lassi was good and sweet."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for nearly 7 years now..the food is good...this review is not about the quality/taste of the food this is more about their terrible service.  I was charged 30%!!!of my final bill as a reservation fee for reserving a table for 6 for Friday evening( we showed up before time). Like I said, we are regulars at this place and this was the first time in 7 years I was hearing about this reservation fee. Moreover, the guy(looks Mexican but could be Midle eastern) who rudely and very firmly told me about this reservation fee acted like a total jerk!!...dude you are supposed to  provide customer service and be polite....you don't work for the IRS!! I asked for a high chair for my  daughter and the same guy simply showed me the place where it is kept..as if..go get it from there..seriously!!! I have known the faimly running this place for past several years..very nice people..I  hope they are reading this review. Please make your policy clear about the reservation fee..and please give some training to your staff to be polite and to actually provide customer service."}
{"text":"Was in the Tempe area and visited CC to try out their Guy Fieri recommended tandoori chicken. The restaurant welcome us at the door with an immediate aroma and we found the last available table for two even at 3pm on a Saturday.  In between college kids and a sprinkling of Indian patrons, the first thing to visually be distracted by are the loud TVs set to the food network but a lively atmosphere regardless.  As today was yet another fiery day in the desert, the owners decided to let us sweat some more by having on a half working AC (a huuuge gripe for me on summer days) and not enough fans.  As we have a pretty high bar for Indian cuisine, the tandoori chicken was indeed moist and charbroiled well. You get two chicken legs per order along with a side of naan or rice. Hubby went for the tikka masala but he was surprised that there was no question of the preferred heat level by our waitress. It turned out a mild variation of what he's used to and a bit lacking in depth of spices.   Their naan was more on the thin crispy side so by my standards a 3 star effort at best. And if you're not a huge coriander lover, definitely ask for the curry sans the pungent leafy condiment as CC does tend to overindulge. Hubby's side was the saffron infused rice which was al dente and a good texture.  We probably won't make a special trip out just for dinner but both our meals summed up to definitely less than one dish at our regular spot in north scottsdale, so those on college budgets should continue to feel comfortable with CC being their go to Tempe curry joint!"}
{"text":"Best goat biriyani in AZ. Bad service."}
{"text":"Super tasty, love the cozy atmosphere, excellent and friendly service!  The naan was a bit thinner and crispier than some others, which I really dug.  We had a goat dish that was outstanding.  Nicely spiced.  Also had the non-vegetarian thali - two chicken curries (one with a bit of sour pickle taste that was very nice), daal, basmati rice and a little salad.  Quite inexpensive.  And I like the less-thick lassi with ice."}
{"text":"Passing by Phoenix area.  Looked up Guy Fieri's website and found this restaurant. WOW! Excellent food and courteous service. We ordered tikki masala, tandoori chicken, seafood bowl, Sindhi lamb,and mango lassi. The food was flavorful and equisite!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible service.....please save yourself some time, pride and money...specially if you are an asian. The skinny weirdo who takes your order does not have any courtesy whatsoever...no hello..no smile...no thank you nothing!! I felt so weird and so little while standing in their cramped and filthy restaurant with my wife for at least 15minutes without being welcomed or even asked to sit down. Finally, the owner lady asked us to sit down with such an attitude as if she is doing a huge favor to us.The lady would talk so nicely about the food and stuff to our non asian neighbors but would never bother coming to us to take our order or even to hand us the menu(btw this has happened to us twice on separate occasions) Wow lady!!..were we not paying or what?? This is not the racist land where you came from and we are not college students who would not react to this kind of mean and rude service. The water took 20 minutes to arrive...don't even wanna talk about the other female server...she is just going through her shift. I grew up eating this kind of food so you can take it from me, seriously it's not that great..they use chicken thigh meat in all curries which is not always a good thing...portions sizes are ridiculously small...nothing interesting really...there are much better and courteous places around. I seriously hope that their \"Guy Fiery\" bubble bursts soon. I am not going back again at any cost...and would highly recommend all of you to stay away..specially if you are an asian."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Very good prices, exceptional service, even better food! They are renovating right now so don't let the decor steer you away. The food is full of flavor and just the right portions. The naan was fluffy and delicious. I would eat there every day if my waistline would allow it! :)"}
{"text":"AWESOME garlic naan. Bubbly, buttery goodness. Entrees were fantastic. Service was prompt and friendly! Prices were nice and low. Could use some updated decor."}
{"text":"The food is OK, but ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT. They overcharged me, my sister, and a friend on 3 separate occasions. Their explanation was that the prices went up but they hadn't had time to update the menu... but it has been months since the first time I was over charged. I will not give business to dishonest people."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. I get the Chicken Tikki masala. Great naan. We go with garlic naan. I've had their mango lassi, it's delicious. No buffet, you order off the menu so everything comes out nice and fresh... And delicious. Definitely recommend. Give it a try. Central location and ambient parking."}
{"text":"Vegetable briyani. Yummy.  They inspired me so much i tried out how to make one and i got ot. Yay . Tried paneer tikka masala. Super. I like spicy food and i got it. Hara bhara paneer, new dish for me it was nice. Naan is bit hard everytime i try here.  Dont know why. Kheer was nice. Have vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Met some friends with my Family.  Everything was very good except for a young server who could not be bothered.  Owner was really nice and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"I rate keeping the price in mind. It's all relative.   Food: 4.5/5 The owner runs the kitchen which ensures consistency and the food is very tasty. I   Service: 2.5/5 The service isn't bad but it can be very slow at times since they're severely understaffed. It's great for lunch. There are a lot of customers during the evening (which says a lot about the food = good) but that over burdens the two servers and they take while to attend to your needs. BUT it's not that big a deal.  General Cleanliness 4/5  Bathroom cleanliness 4/5"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for lunch, it was good! I The place is cute,  not so small people commented as long as it isn't fill up with people. The butter chick Marsala is so good and Mango Lassi is my favorite! Waitress is very helpful as well, she is enthusiasm on recommending us some great food and happy to bring some Lassi favor to see if we like it first. Definitely come next time!"}
{"text":"The curry had a beautifully complex flavor that was unfortunately diminished by overpowering amounts of salt. The phone rang loudly and frequently in the dining area and was a bit of a nuisance.   Otherwise the chicken tikka is an excellent choice and the curries, despite the salt, have much more body than comparably curries I have had locally."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Tempe for reasonably priced and great food. It's located in an eyesore plaza and is desiring a face lift inside but that being said, the food is Amazeballs! Try the chicken tikka masala :D"}
{"text":"I would say the tikki masala was not the best Indian dish I have eaten, but it was fair. The service was lacking and the interior of the restaurant needed updating. It was a expensive dish for a positive note."}
{"text":"Have you been looking for mouth watering ethnic Pakistani food at an inexpensive price?  We didn't know we were looking for it either, until we ended up at Curry Corner last night.  Upon the recommendation of one of our kind followers we headed over to this suspicious looking restaurant for some spectacular food.  We got there pretty close to closing time but the service was still exceptional and they made us feel welcomed and helped us to choose the three dishes.  Most people might know that Guy Fieri showcased this spot on his show but we were unaware until the waiter mentioned it.  He proceeded to recommend the top three dishes that were ordered and enjoyed by Guy, all three of which we dined on as well.  The Tikka Masala was like a party of flavors in my mouth.  The heat from the spices wasn't overpowering but nice and welcoming.  The chicken was moist and there was tons of sauce, perfect for dipping the naan in to.  Processed with VSCOcam with f2 presetNext we dug into the fresh Goat Karahi, our first time eating goat and it was easily likeable.  I did feel that there were more bones in this dish than meat, which was too bad because the meat and the flavors of ginger, garlic and yogurt were delicious.  To take home (because we were enjoying the food so much) we ordered the Tandoori Chicken Tikka.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with it was a great combination.  Corner to try out some more dishes and to eat the Tikka Masala and naan again."}
{"text":"My Indian friend suggested I go and try their goat biryani and mango lhassi. I have to say the portions are huge! It tasted really good and you could tell that they used good quality basmati rice. I couldn't finish half of what was in my plate. The mango lhassi was really refreshing and sweet! loved it! the only issue i have with this place is the service! really horrible. we came around 12 noon and there were very few customers there. but oh my! the waitress was super slow, it took 15 minutes to get the lhassi. And get this--- she doesn't even offer you a straw as she serves you with it. You would have to go get the straw from their counter. I don't get that..  I mean she is already serving the drink, why wouldn't she serve the straw as well. The only redeeming thing is that their price is super cheap for the amount and quality of the food that you get. I will come back some other day and i hope that the service gets better!"}
{"text":"This place has such delicious food and I have never had a bad experience there. The cheese naan is out of this world good - it is light and flavorful and just the right combination of crispy outside and soft inside. I love that there are so many meatless options.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because every time I go, the water is constantly running in the women's bathroom. It never shuts off, and that bothers me. I hate wasting resources and for the water to ALWAYS run - that is a bit excessive to me  please fix your sink so I can update this review and change the rating to 5 stars!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Although I am as white as 2% milk, I grew up frequently eating at the house of an Indian family.  I have mentioned to many people as I have tried many restaurants that I am always trying to find \"Mrs Singh\".  A couple friends and I made it there for lunch today.  There's no ambience, but the food is delicious.  We shared three dishes for a variety of meat and vegetable and it was more than enough.  I like hot but got medium for my friends and we were all happy."}
{"text":"I have to admit--we were here from another state and picked this place because it was on DDD!    I am SO glad we did. We had an amazing meal and it was extremely affordable. We couldn't decide which appetizers to get, so we got three!  The samosas were great, but the real star was the masala fries.   I can't remember the names of our dishes, but we asked the waitress what to get. She recommended two chicken dishes. One was a coconut curry and the other was buttery garlic. They were both some of the best dishes I've had.  There was plenty of food--we couldn't even finish.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious curry and at a great price!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and terrible. I asked for suggestions on what to order and the waiter couldn't explain anything and seemed to have an attitude whenever we asked questions about the menu. Food was ok but wait time was bad! It took 30 minutes before anyone was able to get us drinks. They need more help there as well, the phone was ringing off the hook and the guy working there had no urgency whatsoever."}
{"text":"I love Curry Corner, it's got the best Indian and Pakistani food in Tempe. A lot of my Pakistani friends and Indian friends all recommend it. After going for a couple of years, I was glad to see they had expanded the place and got some publicity with Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Their Chicken Makhani and briyani is so good and their garlic naan can be eaten on its own. Definitely a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Came on 7/23/2014 with a group of 10 - service was awful and the food was worse - the only saving grace was that the prices are cheap - and I suppose that's because you get what you pay for!  I ordered the tandoori wings and a side of nan - I never got the nan - it was delivered to the other end of the table and I never saw any of that. Everyone else got their orders but me - I waited 10 more - long - minutes before my 8 little tandoori wings arrived, only to find that they were dried out and so hot with curry that I could only eat one. I was extremely dissappointed to say the least.  My daughter who had her 6 week old baby with her - asked for a small bowl of hot water to place the baby's bottle in (to warm up the milk) - and was told by our server that \"they don't have hot water here\".... Seriously? You're a freakin RESTUARANT and you DON'T HAVE HOT WATER? Finally, after realizing what a pathetic boob he was making himself look like, our waiter brought a small teacup full of warm water to our table.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand to top things off for our excursion to a Triple D rated establishment - ALL TEN OF OUR PARTY GOT SICK FROM THE FOOD WE ATE AT THE CURRY CORNER!!! Maybe they should change their name to the \"Colitis Corner\" - cramps, nausea & vomitting - I lost a day of work due to the food I ate made it impossible for me to go to my job.  This is the seond time I've gone to an establishment that had the old \"As Seen on Diners, Drive ins and Dives\" - Curry Colitis Corner is DEFINATELY A DIVE !!! Be afraid - BE VERY AFRAID !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here, food was okay, not the best. This place is overrated. Only good thing is the tikka masala fries! My food was cold when I got it! Our waiter KELLY was the best, until his shift ended and we ended up with a rude waiter who didn't even pay attention to us! Asked for drink refill and boxes many times before we got them, and it wasn't that busy! Maybe I would've given this place another star if Kelly remained our waiter, because it seems like he's the only one with good customer service!"}
{"text":"We decided as a family to rate this place food and service, because we felt that one overall rating wouldn't work. The food was flavorful but not all of it was amazing. The tandoori wings were so tasty, the hummus was the best we have probably ever had and the lamb tikka malsala was a definite favorite along with the naan bread. Other items were a bit to salty but over all the food was good. Food we gave a rating of 7 out of 10.  Unfortunately the front of the house is where this place needs the most work. Items that were ordered were missing, which may have been the result of the to servers taking our orders. Place could use a good scrub down and some kind of gnat spray. We had to ask for water refills, only to be refilled by what we assumed to be timid tap water. Servers more interested in the grub hub drivers that came in then the actual patrons siting in the restaurant. Unfortunately the service rating from us was a 4.  Maybe better to get food to go next time."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.  Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.  Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.  I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.  I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!  Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.  A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.  I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.  No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the chicken tikka masala and the naan (love the garlic)-- this place singlehandedly put the word naan in our kids vocabulary. They clamor for it each time we are there. Also the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Saw the place on Diners Drive ins & Dives. I can usually tell when the host genuinely likes a restaurant. I got the vibe he was really feeling this place, I wasn't wrong. It's the real deal. The Goat Karai is in the top 5 dishes I've EVER had. I mean, it's off the charts. We tried about 5 different dishes and EVERY dish was www.bomb.com. If you're looking for a \"high end\" place to eat, this isn't it. It's a college dive that's frequented by students. It's a well taken care of place that delivers on quality food, period. If you want a great meal, this is it. My only complaint, the water is horrible. It's awful. We had to purchase their bottled water. It would make sense to add some sort of filtration system to their water supply. But they get to sell bottled water because of the awful tap water, so from a business standpoint, I get it."}
{"text":"Best indian food in AZ. Get the chicken tikka fries. Very affordable. Inexpensive excellence."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Tikka Masala, Curry Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Pakoros, naan. All to die for.  I just left and am trying to figure out what night I can go back. Amazing and flavorful to the max!"}
{"text":"Seating:  Confusing; the table set up is strange and it's unclear if you should seat yourself or wait to be seated.  They left the table dirty that was next to us the whole time we were there, and it was actually connected to our table.  Drinks:  My wife's mango lassi was completely forgotten (thankfully we weren't charged), and my water was never refilled even though it was empty before I got my main dish.  Food:  Overall very good; bold flavors, great textures, and the prices are extremely reasonable for what you're getting.  Service:  This is the doozy.  The server was cold, inattentive, distracted, and careless.  At one point while we were eating we saw a few people walk in and then stand there awkwardly because they were not greeted.  Our server peeked his head out, saw them, and then continued talking to someone in the back.  It blew my mind.  The young girl who brought us our food seemed nice though, and was the only pleasant encounter we had while we were there.  Honestly, my wife and I are both caucasian, and I wouldn't even mention this if I didn't feel like it was part of the reason why they treated us like we weren't even there.  Overall:  A restaurant can serve the best food in the world, but if the service is as bad as what we experienced tonight, it just wouldn't be worth it to go back.  We'll consider ordering takeout, but that's it.  We truly felt unwelcome there from the time we walked in to the time we walked out."}
{"text":"The food was nice, they seemed to be short on staff but it didn't reflected in service.  Tikka masala fries was a gr8 starter, never had fries in indian style. The chicken curry was nice and naan were also good. Overall a nice place to visit, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is on par and amazing but the service leaves something to be desired. The staff is not rude but generally a little inattentive. The atmosphere is that of a dive location but the last time I went it looked like they had done some modest remodeling.  I am ok that the service isn't stellar because I really enjoy the food.  The Goat is amazing!!!  Favorite Indian/Pakistani food around just go with little expectation for the service and ambience and you will be a fan I am sure.   Check them out if you like authentic food!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on my cravings for Indian food in addition to the yelp reviews. I've only tried the basic korma curry and samosas, but will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu...eventually. haha. The prices were decent and affordable for the college/family budget. I had take away so I can't comment on the service, but the girl who rang up my order was very welcoming and nice. Tip: Grab some craft beer or wine next door and you're good to go! haha"}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken Wings are Yummm...Their Chicken Boti kabab for appetizer , Karahi chicken for Entree are must try's . Best place for Fresh and Delicious food for a very very reasonable price .Totally apt Punch line Inexpensive Experience and i will add an amazing one !"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because the food is amazing. The service, however, left a little to be desired.   When we walked in no one greeted us and there was no sign saying \"seat yourself\" so we sort of stood there for awhile not sure what to do. Eventually we just sat down and waited. It took awhile for the waitress to come take our order.   We ordered tikka masala fries, the vegetarian combo, and my husband ordered the tandoori chicken. Everything was great but those fries were killer! They were delicious. I couldn't stop eating them.    The naan that came with the vegetarian plate was so good. I loved everything.   When we were done we waited a really long time for our check. Eventually we just walked up to the register where the waitress was and asked her if we paid there or at the table. She was really nice but I think she was overloaded with how many people were in there.   I will go back. It was seriously good enough to make me drive out to Tempe again. The place isn't a fancy restaurant (really casual) but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"On our way out camping we decided to stop in to this Triple D visited est and while mine was super good the hubby wasn't as lucky.    The curry looks great but I was really feeling the Tandoori chicken so I went for the sizzler player. The beef kabobs were good with a nice spice mix but the two offered was enough for me, the consistency was off. It seemed like it was ground beef made into a patty? The Tandoori chicken and the other option, don't remember name was both very moist, with quite a bit of heat to them, and really delightful.   Hubby ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala. I enjoyed it enough, he didn't like it at all. I think the waitress misunderstood his request for the spiciest menu item as it had none and the mix of spices especially the mint and yogurt didn't sit well with either of us.... He finished MAYBE half.  We also ordered the garlic naan and later on the hummus as the naan had absolutely no flavor, nothing like the one we enjoy from the store even, so we needed a dip to get through it. The hummus however was amazing and very garlicky.    Overall it was ok, we are from out of town so if in the area again we would opt to try a different eatery"}
{"text":"Worst service are the only words which comes to my mind. Staff is arrogant.  We ordered samosa for starters and chicken Biryani for main course and it took them 40 minutes to put the samosas on my table and another 30 mins for the chicken Biryani. No raita was provided."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, but the food is super yummy and I'm pretty patient, so it doesn't bother me too much. Lots of good vegetarian options, the samosas, hummus, and garlic naan make my mouth water..."}
{"text":"We had samosas and the hummus as starters. Both were great--hot and flavorful! My main dish, lamb tikki Marsala was also very delicious. Also great price point! Service was fast and asked us often if we were alright. No complaints at all would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Stay away from curries they are watered down. Friendly people cozy atmosphere. All I tried was chicken tikka masala and it's not up to par."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some friends who have never had Indian/Pakistani food.  I thought it would be a good experience for them, and luckily it was!  We had a variety of dishes, including the tikka masala fries (YUM!!!), chicken tandoori naan, cheese naan, paneer tikka masala, Afghan something (?), goat curry, and beef handi (sp?)  Everything was excellent!  We all enjoyed every dish!  The service was okay.  It wasn't bad, but there was no rapport whatsoever.  Even though the food was excellent, I thought the prices were just a tad steep.  Still, I would definitely come back for the paneer tikka masala alone!  Tasty!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite corner for getting Curry of all the corners in the Phoenix valley. Everything is tasty and well priced, but the Nihari Noor Jehan is my favorite - very flavorful and a good amount of spice. They have been featured in Phoenix new times and on Diners, Dives, and Drive-ins."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there tonight for the 1st time, not only did he find a hair in his food but he has been throwing up ever since we got home, its been about an hour now of vomiting, will NOT EVER eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Best South Asian food at the best price.  Growing up eating Indian food, its hard for me to give high ratings to most of the South Asian places.  However, Curry Corner is a happy exception.   Almost everything I have eaten here  (4 or so visits), has been really good.  I really liked their samosas, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, dal, and saag paneer.  I didn't care too much for the channa masala or the murgh achari. Also, their naan is awesome, they are hands down the best I've had in the valley!   The staff members are polite and many of them take care to ensure their customers are having an enjoyable experience.  The service is typically quick, but when its busy the service does lag.  Its not unusual to see people awkwardly standing by the door waiting to be seated.  But once a staff member comes to seat you, you're set since they are very accommodating in making room to seat waiting patrons.  If you want to eat South Asian food in Tempe this is the place to go, they have quality food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Authentic, variety, tenderness, and flavor are the first words that come to mind. I had the chapli and it was the best I've ever had. I also got samosas which were a great balance of crisp, flaky and moist. My main entree was the Arabian Thali which I devoured. It's an all around great place for cheap authentic indo-paki-afghan food. Five stars for the good. Atmosphere and costumer service was lacking, bit to be expected at a small authentic place of the sort."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service earns this place a 3 star. The servers have poor multitasking abilities and forget simple tasks like bringing water to the table after 15 min of ordering and bringing out the food without silverware, Also, do not ask the servers if something is spicy .... The server said not really and when the food came out I couldn't handle it after a few bites. I have a low spice tolerance. The naan was good!"}
{"text":"One day after work  I decided to visit the Curry Corner with my friend, and I was a little skeptical to try the food because I have tried a lot of average Indian food, and I didn't want to have that experience again, but I noticed the food was Pakistani style.  Since I had chicken twice that day already, I wanted to order a beef dish. The guy at the counter told me that they were out of beef.  Then I decided to order the most popular dish the \"Chicken Tikka Masala.\"      It was a different kind of Indian/Pakistani dish that I am used to. Usually these kind of dishes are heavy, but this dish was very light, but flavorful at the same time.  The Naan bread was different as well. It was a lot lighter and fluffier then the usual Naan bread; the rice was pretty good too.  We ended up paying about $10 bucks a person. I would like to pay a little toward the $7-$8 range for this kind of place because they don't serve you, but $10 is ok.   Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food, and want something lighter, but flavorful at the same time."}
{"text":"We went twice in one week. After hearing about this place from coworkers I had to try. I don't recall what we ordered as we just asked the super sweet waitress to bring us sampling of her favorite dishes. Spice was just right and the flavor is delightfully foreign. A must try!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food , worst hospitality/service, using lot of artificial food colors .Also seen fight in kitchen between the chefs . I will NOT go to this restaurant again . And this is not Indian restaurant this Pakistani restaurant."}
{"text":"it seriously blows my mind that this place has a 4.5 star average. who is rating this stuff so high?!!  the samosas were served room-temperature, my paneer dish was EXTREMELY greasy, my mango lassi never came, the entire restaurant was out of napkins (not kidding!) and the chicken dishes come with such huge chunks of chicken that there's barely any flavor (so i'm told, i don't eat meat). a highlight was the garlic naan, lowlight, the service. by far. two young women who didn't care the least about good service.  don't waste your time or money. seriously, go up the street to the dhaba. waaaaaay better food and service. a little pricier, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I didn't have a bad experience and enjoyed the Afghan Chicken with Garlic Nan. I'd eat it again too but the wait for the meal was really long and when you have a lunch break they need to move a bit faster on the food. We had to scarf it down and couldn't finish because of time. It took us nearly 30 min to get our meal and it wasn't packed when we ordered it as we were the first to arrive. If the service had been better I could give them a 4 star review but it wasn't. I'd still try it again though, just don't know when with other curry places in the city."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Sat down for 15mins didn't take our drink orders nor acknowledge us. I ordered appetizer I was looking forward to it but it never made it out to me! Ordered curry chicken dish and it was salty. My Nann bread was just ok, just wished they cut it for me instead of giving it to me in a basket without cutting it first.  The chef/owner that was cooking on Guy F. Show I'd rather have her  cook for me! The guys there didn't know nothing. So I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I thought Curry Corner was fantastic. I ordered something like a vegetarian sampler platter, and it was so good, I ordered a second entree immediately after.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of what dishes I had. But it was stuff that I don't typically see on south Asian restaurant menus, so I get the impression it's fairly traditional / authentic stuff. Not just mainstream \"Americanized Indian\" food. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)  I will say that my (meat-eating) companions were not as enthusiastic about their dishes, but that has more to do with the fact that they don't really like curries and south Asian food, and less to do with Curry Corner specifically.  Also, service was a little slow and not terribly friendly. Oh, and the faucet in the men's restroom was leaking so much it was basically just On. I mentioned it to the waitstaff, so hopefully it's fixed by the time I've posted this."}
{"text":"Got this place from Diners Drivins and Dives. When I walked in to this place it looked kind of low budget but when we tasted the food it was suprisingly wonderful. The only problem was service. They forgot my wifes meal and that took a while to fix. But the food is worth going back and trying again."}
{"text":"Seriously, am I missing something???   I seem to be the only person who has had better Indian food.  The fam and I decided to give this place a try, even though it is very far from home, but with a recommendation like DDD, what could go wrong?  Well, first off, it's a bit chaotic when you walk in.  No real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated.  Once we were seated we were rushed to order... thankfully we mostly knew what we wanted.  I tryed the marsala fries, which were BY FAR the best thing we ate.  Those, I must say are amazing.  I also had a bite of the samosas, which were ok... not really that favorful, and the chicken tikka masala.  Honestly, it was ok, but I've had better... even from Trader Joes.  We also had the goat... this too was ok... better than the masala, but so fatty it was hard to eat.  So, long story short... if you live near here then perhaps hit it up.  Otherwise, check out some Indian food closer to home... that is my recommendation.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"After, seeing this place on Food Network  Triple D's. I knew I wanted try this place the next time I was in Mesa, Arizona.  I  arrived and was told to seat myself.  A waiter came with a somewhat tattered menu. The prices of foods on menu had been written on piece of paper and taped on menu. I  ordered The Arabic plate it consist of: Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Biryani Rice, Yogurt, pickled slices of Onion , Hummus and Naan. I also ordered a Mango Lassi. I brought a ginormous plate of food.  I  got everything but the Curry Chicken. Instead they gave either Lamb or Beef Curry. I was okay with that, being I wanted to try it.  The food was pretty good. The right amount of spices with a hint of garlic. The Naan was perfection. Now, for that Mango Lassi. This was my first one ever. I  like flavor but it wasn't cold. It could have been chilled. I  don't know if Lassi are supposed to be room  temperature. If it is to be served at room temperature. I will never order again.   I probably will not go back.  It was just okay. I have had much better."}
{"text":"The Chicken Boti is awesome, though the lunch serving was not served as a kebab. I also love the Naan. Prices seemed responsible. The tikka masala fries are really good too."}
{"text":"Nothing is as good as Curry Corner! We've tried so many restaurants in the Phoenix area and this one is TOPS! We highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Definitely go here. Delicious curries... I hope to be back many times."}
{"text":"Oh man!  Rarely do I hand out 5 stars... but this place is an exception.  First off, don't be turned off by the crummy strip mall it's in, or the Tempe trash that loiters around outside scratching at their coke bugs... or the fact that u-turns and left-hand turns are a pain in the ass off of Apache due to this light-rail set-up - you must open your mind!  The guy working tonight was either the owner or son of the owner or something but he KNEW customer service.  He was welcoming, friendly, informative... diligent with cleaning up, taking and bringing orders AND answering the myriad of questions I threw out at him (like \"is the lamb leg or shoulder... are the bones included...?\")  This guy knew his food (we shared our goat meat sources and cooking tips) and described everything in a very detailed way.  I sure wasn't asking lots of questions to be picky.. no, in fact I was wanting to learn how this $9 goat dish I had was having such an effect on me... OOF!  BEST friggin $9 I've spent so far this year!!!  I could eat this all day!  Out from the kitchen where a Pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic, succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew... it was fantastic!  I love that they used the fat renderings with the garam masala to make this *heavenly* soupy deliciousness that was plentiful in the little container.... damn, I'm salivating just remembering it all over again.  SO, check out this place.  The guy was awesome but what stood out the most was their flavorful goat dish... the goat being the stand-out!   My sister's Chicken Tikka was also super flavorful, but mine was definitely more complex and interesting... now i just need another excuse to go to Tempe so I can relive this!"}
{"text":"I will give this place a five  Clean restrooms  Good food  I was advised by another Resturant to come here and was informed they are all Halal so here we are  Portions are little small for the price but good tasty food  You will not be disappointed for the price"}
{"text":"I have now been back to Curry Corner a few times & must update my review! After trying out a variety of items like the paneer tikka masala, vegetable hundi, etc. I found the hidden gem .. the Chicken Makhni!  Most Indian restaurants serve their curries with rice, or nothing at all, so I'm happy to be able to be able to pick one or the other depending on my mood. Both taste equally good with but I prefer the soft yet crispy naan! The portion size of their dishes is large enough that I normally have some for dinner & the rest for lunch.  This place in on my way home from work so I often stop by to pick up a to-go order. They have it ready within 15 to 20 minutes. It's always piping hot & remains that way until I drive home. I've become a frequent visitor here & will continue to be one!"}
{"text":"I'm sure Curry Corner is a great place but tonight was not their night. The Palak Paneer was bland but my boyfriends Goat Haleem was good! My chai tea tasted like Lipton tea...ZERO spice and it took over 30 min to get my tea. The garlic naan was good and the cheesy naan was too cheesy, like imagine quesadilla on steroids. Unfortunately my night ended with a roach chillin to my right just crawling across the table......shit happens, it's gross but it is bound to happen at some point somewhere...this place is clean and new but I could not eat another bite, a roach is a definite deal breaker! I tried this place due to the triple D show but I think I'll stick to my joint down the street, Khoorinors."}
{"text":"It's sooooo good after I checked out with my friends. I wanna go there again and again!! Especially my favorite drink, Mango lassi is so good there!!!"}
{"text":"Warning! This place can mess up. My girlfriend and I went her on Sunday.  Within hours of eating we both got really ill. I recovered in a day, my girlfriend has been sick for 3 days. I now have to take her to the hospital because she has not been able to keep any food down. The food tasted fine, but clearly there was something wrong with place. I assume unwashed hands or ingredients were the cause."}
{"text":"Service still bad, but I keep coming back because the food is excellent. Try the tikka masalla fries, it is different and I love it. Chicken tikka masalla is still the best. Ordering the food to go Is the bet option."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Fish tikka masala in bomb! I moved away to Colorado and still have dreams of this food! Every time I come to town eating at curry corner is a MUST!  The only problem here is I always eat too much :)"}
{"text":"The Chicken Makhani was delicious!  I was scraping the bowl to make sure I got every last drop of this luxurious sauce dish!  If you like  creamy Indian chicken butter dish, try this one!  It is THE BOMB!  Nancy M enjoyed her vegetarian dish as well.  There was a nice selection of vegetarian  entrees."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good and service is great. Especially Mark, he was very attentive to us and everyone in the restaurant. If you are looking for a quick and cheap place to eat this it!"}
{"text":"Curry Corner is always good, and really cheap for what you get. The tikka masala fries are unique and fun, and everything we've had has been really tasty. The platters have enough food to take some home, and you get to sample multiple dishes.  Just FYI, though, you might want to bring your own water if you're ordering anything that is at all spicy, because the servers seem pretty busy and don't do refills or any other kind of interaction, besides taking your order (it will probably take them 10-15 minutes to get to you for that). We've had multiple experiences where our water glasses have been empty for the whole meal, even after we've asked for refills. Also, don't expect anyone to come check on you - if you need something, ask multiple people!  In short, great food for good prices, with poor service. In our book, it still gets four stars because of the value, but barely."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite curry place in town. Service has always been on point for me--its never unreasonably slow (even when they're busy). My dishes always come out hot and fresh. The naan is amazing. My favorite is the Rajistani, and you can't go wrong with Tikka Masala if it's your first time."}
{"text":"I make a habit of visiting Food Network locations, and usually they are just as amazing as the show says...Curry Corner is just 'ok'.  I've had Indian/Pakistani food all over the country and this did not stand up to the hype on Food Network.  I've been there 3 times and have had the Chicken Tikka (featured), the Tikka Masala, and the Aloo Saag.  The Chicken Tikka was great, but the other two were the exact same dishes you'd find at any average Indian restaurant.  The food has also been luke-warm every single time, like it had been sitting for about 10 minutes before being brought out.  Food-wise this comes nowhere near the really good Indian places I've been...it's not bad, but not great either.  Now onto the service, which is where most of this review score comes from.  The customer service is TERRIBLE.  Everyone working there acts like they have no idea what's going on, like this is their first time in a restaurant and they don't know how it works.  My party of two had to wait for 15 minutes before being seated and there were only 2 other families in there.  They gave us literally 10 seconds to look at the menu before very briskly asking for our order, and then looking offended when we said we needed more time.  The food took WAY too long (and like I said felt like it had just been sitting), and the check took even longer.  We didn't have a consistent waiter, different people kept coming over to us and I really got the impression that they don't have any type of consistent system for waiting on their guests.  In general, everyone working there acts like they don't care that you came in and are deciding to spend your money there.  It makes me not want to come back.  CURRY CORNER: if you are reading this, go hire a consultant to come in and show you how to run a restaurant.  You really really need some help with this.  The restaurant itself is shabby and the tables and booths are arranged really awkwardly.  It's not particularly clean or festive looking and the fish tank is really really dirty.  I could see into the kitchen and that didn't look very clean either.  There is no music playing and it makes it way too quiet and awkward in there.    Sadly, I don't agree with Guy Fieri on this one.  You can find better food and better service at other Indian spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG...this place is bomb!  I don't know whether to be happy (my wallet) or sad that we live on the other side of town! We WILL be going back!  Amazing food and amazing prices!!"}
{"text":"I went back last night.  Had to.  There is no better Chicken Tikka Masala around.... It was superb as usual along with the garlic naan and samosas.   And I'm please to report that the service this time,unlike almost every visit before, was very professional.   I'm not a college student and won't just be 'ok' with any kind of service. Maybe college students aren't either.  She was attentive, took my order promptly, brought everything I needed to the table, and checked on me 2-3 times during the course of my solo dining.  Very well done indeed.  I just hope they can keep up this level of service because it matches their food now!  Nuff said."}
{"text":"The Tikka Masala fries ended up being a little disappointing, the flavor of the sauce was a little lacking.  But whatever, what do you expect ordering white people food?  I did get the chicken tikka masala (yes, I know, more white people food), and the sauce was better here (shouldn't it be the same sauce?) But the star was the chicken.  It was so tender, falling apart and just awesome.  My wife got the hummus with beef and it was a surprise.  There was so much for the price and it was packed with flavor.  It's tough to warrant going here when Haji Baba is so close, but Curry Corner is JUST different enough that I can say it's worth it sometimes."}
{"text":"Went to the Curry Corner for the first tine, and the food was absoLtely amazing. The best part of the whole experience was I was able to BYOB. The service was quick. I would recommend it to any on who like this style of food."}
{"text":"My favorite! Food is amazing. Family owned and operated. Can't go wrong with the chicken tikka masala. I drive from Queen Creek to Tempe to eat here."}
{"text":"Food prices were great. The samosas were delicious. I ordered the beef curry and it seemed a little bland. The beef was tender, but not my favorite curry. I'd return and try it again."}
{"text":"I went back. I thought I will give a try again.  Disappointed.  Oil curry"}
{"text":"My husband and I are auditioning new Indian food places since our favorite, Royal Taj, will be closing soon. I figured Curry Corner would be a good place to start.  When we arrived, the owner sat us at a dirty table and didn't even notice the debris. It was the gentleman who brought out our water later that seemed to be embarrassed by the mess and immediately wiped the table.   I got the vegetarian thali so that I could try a few different dishes at once, and my husband got the chicken tikka masala since it's a good \"comparison\" dish. Our food came out fairly quickly although my naan lagged behind a few minutes. At least it was fresh and hot though very plain. The dal and chickpeas were the standouts in my dish. Tons of flavor for something so simple. My husband was happy with his chicken. He said the meat was tender, and the sauce wasn't overwhelmed with cream like at other places. He was hoping for a bigger portion, but for the price, it was a good value. The basmati was decent, but we prefer the more spiced version from our usual place.  Service was really lacking though. We had to ask for water. My husband's entree didn't come with a plate. No one checked up on us after the food arrived. We had to ask for the check. We observed other patrons who got wrong orders or orders that were forgotten altogether. The misspelled t-shirts worn by the staff \"In Expensive Excellence\" really irked me too. I would try Curry Corner again, but I might stick to takeout."}
{"text":"I have not had much Indian food before this place but it was very good! The tiki masala was delicious and the garlic non was incredible. My one complaint was that the samosas filling was a little too starchy."}
{"text":"Two words:  Goat Karahi.  The reason I will be willing to drive from San Tan Valley to Tempe again.    Hopefully I spelled this right, by the way.  I forgot to grab a take-out menu to get names right.  Anyway, this dish was suggested by our server.  Who incidentally was very courteous and attentive.    The goat was tender, flavorful and just delicious.  We should have ordered two dishes of it because it comes on the bone and my husband and I were left wanting more.    We also had the Chicken Korma, which was good but when we return we'll try something else.    Prices are excellent, entrees include either rice or naan.  We opted for rice but also ordered garlic naan.  Good call on our part.  The naan was crispy and soft at the same time with great garlic flavor.  Yum!  If I understand correctly, they've recently remodeled.  I saw no problems with cleanliness, one of the things that seems to have been an issue previously.    Had a nice chat with our server about how their experience was with Guy Fieri as well.    Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"In the mood for Indian so we tried The Dhaba but it was that weird time of day between lunch and dinner. So, we went to Curry Corner. The service wasn't great. Wife got a soda but wasn't offered a refill until we were ready to leave. And the food was spicy, so she REALLY kinda needed it. She asked at one point and we thought the server heard us, but apparently she didn't. The food is okay. I've definitely had better Indian and I'm not sure what would bring us back here."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. Only one waitress and she did not do a good job. Slow to clean off tables, didn't come by to ask if we needed refills. They allow you to sit where you want but then when a larger party comes in, they don't have a good spot to sit. If they had a better waitress or one more, I think I could bump up the rating."}
{"text":"Scrumptious meal butter chk and fresh garlic naan  always enjoy the food here never disappointed but I also never anything else lol advise food is served extremely hot !!!!! Let it cool down before u partake taste so much better when cooled down ..., is it wrong to want to drink the butter chk sauce ??!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, location is meh, interior has an awkward layout, and service is hit or miss.  The food keeps me coming back (it really is excellent), but I do wish their service was a bit more consistent."}
{"text":"Curry Corner has inspired me to write my first review on Yelp! I've been coming to this place for years, when I first discovered it thanks to the Food Network. First time I came, I loved it! I loved the food, loved the kind attention (from the female owner) and loved the price. Quite the deal!  However, from a place where I used to love bringing newcomers at a regular basis, it has now become a place where I only show up scarcely and only with a person that already knows its food. Because the biggest problem with this restaurant, is its SERVICE!  To be specific... it's only ONE server I have a problem with. But in a restaurant with only one (maybe two) servers at a time, one bad server is a big deal.  I don't know his name but (and not to be racist) he looks like the only server actually from India/Pakistan region. Other servers seem hispanic or white. Well, this man is the WORST server I've seen in my life. How he's been with this restaurant for so long? It's probably one of life's biggest mysteries because based to my little research, he's not related to the owners.   Anyway... this guy walks with the speed of a drunk zombie inside a turtle exhibition. He stares at you as if he's figuring out what life's meaning is all about. He always sits people at tables and then 5-10 min later he hands them menus, and 5-10 min later he takes your order... instead of doing this all at once! (I paid my college tuition as a server for 5 years so I know what I'm talking about.) He's not nice, not informative, does not understand what you're saying, you don't understand what he's saying. Overall, a mess! If he waits on me, I know it's gonna be horrible service. Food comes out before water gets to table, bread gets there when food is almost finished. And don't even think of requesting extra little things like a little more sauce... because that's a task he'll probably forget, ignore or both!   It's a shame, because I think this guy alone can ruin a business. I'm not saying to get rid of the guy, but the owner should have a talk with him to inspire him to be a little better at his job. I get how some people don't like their jobs, but he has to understand that he works in the service industry and simple things like a smile, an acknowledgement or even a quicker pace of walking can do a difference!  Speaking about the service industry, through my little research I found out that servers do NOT receive the tips. Although it looks like they do get paid their full minimum salary. But why would I restaurant not adopt this system? I believe not giving the tips to their employees can only hurt a business since maybe the incitement for good service is not there. This place is always pretty empty and has the potential to be booming because the food is very good and at a great price and that's the only reason this place gets 3 Stars from me instead of 0."}
{"text":"I am not a review writer ever. Until now. I have been a foodie my whole life and certain thing like quality, simplicity and authenticity are all keys to great food. Curry Corner has truly stuck by tradition and has done an amazing job showing the people in this state what good middle eastern food is. If you don't like the food here you most likely don't have the knowledge or pallet to enjoy this type of food. With the exception of mostly American produced ingredients everything is authentic. Choose one or all of the dishes. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So we finally checked this place out based on Guy's recommendation on his show and I really just don't get it We ordered the garlic naan, rice biryani, chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma. The curries were both very thin and lacking the depth of flavors I am used to. The chicken korma really wasn't that good at all - the tikka masala was better but still not that great. I was really disappointed! The biryani was ok but lack luster. The best was the garlic naan probably. There are many other indian restaurants that are far supreme to this one (sorry to say). Although I am fine with dives, this place does need to work on its appearance inside. It just seemed not clean. Not going back. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Being an ASU student, I really love how close this place is to campus. It's open till 11 PM, too-- so I like to pick up food before/after study sessions and it works out really well. The food is amazing here-- much better than other Desi restaurants around the Valley. The staff is very amicable and polite, and will easily remember you when you come back again (once is never enough with a place like this). Prices are great, and the menu is surprisingly diverse for a place that prides itself on its curry. This restaurant's opening has been the best thing to happen to me at ASU."}
{"text":"Good for the college town students. Not an authentic food. Ordered an a hair chicken and it was completely blend. Also the aloo tikki for appetizers were just plain with a mint sauce. No flavors here."}
{"text":"I love DDD and always check out his picks when in the area. Seen this on TV and decided to see what all the hoo-ha was all about. Normally Guy is pretty good with his choices but sometimes he can be off a bit.  Inside is rather small and appears to be a hit with the ASU students as well as the regulars who live or work nearby. There are two TVs that are always on and either playing the Food Network or a cheesy flick from overseas.  The menu has a several choices to pick from when ordering. Some are more Pakistani style while others are more of the standard favorites that you would see for this type of restaurant cuisine.  Started with a some appetizers. Ordered the Samosas with dipping sauces and on another visit some Aloo Tikki. Had to try what Guy had eaten so got the Goat Karahi with Garlic Naan and then came back again later in the week and tried the Tandoori Chicken Tikka.  They definitely got the flavors down but the portions seemed rather small. Really liked both the Goat and the Tandoori. Wish that you could order a larger version of the meals without having to pay for two dishes. I had asked if I could get the Tandoori with more chicken for an extra charge and I was told that was not an option. Hmmm?  Give them a try and make sure to fill up on the appetizers first so that you are not still hungry when you are finished. Prices are reasonable until you end up ordering more than what you were expecting. THAT'S MONEY!  3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"I went here because I saw in triple D, the food was good..location could be more clean tho."}
{"text":"We went over Xmas holidays. My son and I were on a quest to go to many DDD eateries. We ordered dishes featured on the show and plus 2 more. Food is good; 4 stars. However, service is slow; it wasn't crowded at all. I am fine with service, as long as they are cooking the food. The issue I had was with the waitress. She bites her nails often. Often had her fingers in her mouth. She brought the dishes to our table. They need to hire servers with better hygenes."}
{"text":"My friend in Arizona recommended Curry Corner after finding it via the Food Network app. Overall the experience was good, but I don't think I'd return if I were in the area as I've had better Indian and Pakistani food.  We arrived on a lazy Sunday afternoon close to 12 and the place was quite empty. We sat at one of the few small tables against the wall and began debating what we should order.  We started with an order of the Tikka Masala fries, which I'd seen recommended on Yelp. They were good, especially the portions with feta cheese, but I'd recommend skipping them. The fries were pretty soggy, which is understandable, but the tikka masala sauce wasn't very flavorful or spicy.   I ordered the Vegetarian thali, a combination of 2 vegetable curries, lentils, rice, naan, yogurt, and a small salad. It was good, though the lentils were incredibly salty. The standout for me was the yogurt dip, which I found really refreshing. The curries were good, just not outstanding. Still, the price can't be beat for the amount of food you get.  My friend ordered the Arabic Plate, which is like the thali plates in that you get two kinds of curry (hers had chicken), lentils, biryani rice, hummus instead of yogurt, salad, and naan. I liked these curries better than my vegetarian ones personally.  The oddest part of our visit was watching someone, presumably an employee, wander back and forth between the kitchen and cleaning the outdoor windows. It made me feel slightly awkward about the potential for unsanitary conditions where my food was being made.  I'd honestly skip Curry Corner, but it's not a bad decision."}
{"text":"We had a good experience. We had to try Curry Corner after seeing it on DDD. The rude waiter everyone talks about must of had the day off. Our server was fine. Food was great as expected."}
{"text":"I'm back again & the place looks great & remodeled since the last time I was here-   AMAZING FOOD is all i can say! very authentic, the chicken masala is all I get at indian restaurants, here at CC it's not as heavy & creamy as other places so doesn't leave u feeling bloated-   Ps: to Nadia C below, with her 1 star rating, this isn't \"Pei-Wei\" hunny so dont go talking about \"service\" & websites blah blah blah...this place is excellent, authentic, i would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The red curry was great. I got the chicken wrap and the seasoning and cooking was perfect. I dipped the pita in the red curry and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix, period. Disagree? Fight me 1vs1.   No seriously, this place is amazing. If you're not on a diet plan, get the masala fries. You won't regret it. If you are on a diet, get the masala fries, you will regret it, but at least you can cry in tears of deliciousness.   I've been at least 4x in parties of at least 6 so we practically got many dishes and shared. My most favorite one of course is the chicken tikka masala and the grilled meats. Also, this was my first experience with CHEESEY NAAN! Cheesey naan + whatever meat = homerdrooling.gif  This place is also Halal for those that need to know.   So once again, if you want a good Indian fix, this is the place."}
{"text":"I have very little knowledge of Indian cuisine and absolutely no knowledge of Pakistani cuisine but this place was fantastic.  I ordered Nehani Noor Jehan, which was intensely flavorful...almost a floral fragrance in your nose while your mouth tastes rich, thick sauce with beef shanks.  I ate it with rice and some prices of their yummy, freshly-made naan.    My dining companion had the Chicken Jalfrezi and it was delicious.  I'll have that next time.  Lots of tender chunks of chicken. This would be a great place to go with a bunch of friends so you can order and share several of their specialties.  I already want to return!!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! my husband loves diners, drive in's and dives and when we saw this place reviewed and realized it's five minutes from where we live, we decided to go there today for lunch. I'm not a super adventurous eater, but this was AMAZING! Awesome service.......our servers were attentive, helpful and helped us order!  We will FOR SURE be back!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant quite often when we lived in Tempe and the quality was amazing. As an American who grew up in a traditional midwest household, my tolerance for spicy food is extremely low. My husband is from India, however, and needs spice in his meals -- so this place used to be perfect for us because I could get mild dishes.   I don't know if the management has changed or what, but today when we were there we were told that all of the food is pre-made and they cannot make anything without red chili. The only option is to pour creme into a pre-made dish to try to dilute it. I have never had this happen at a restaurant before and was absolutely shocked to learn all of the food is pre-made spicy here. Cooking indian food at home and having half of a family that's indian, I know it is very simple and possible to make non-spicy food without the use of creme--it's done by not using so much red chili.   Honestly, the easy answer to appeal to more customers here is to make all food mild and add heat to it based on a customers preferences instead of making it all spicy.   So while our family all enjoyed lunch, I was not able to eat because I am 8 months pregnant and cannot have spicy food. I prefer vegetarian food and the only non-spicy veg they had was palak paneer which is full of creme."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and good food. Last star reserved because servers were overwhelmed by dinner rush, sauces were a little salty (but not a deal breaker), and we sat in a cramped corner in a dining room that got pretty hot. I'll be back though to try other things."}
{"text":"Very good and inexpensive. No alcohol served. Not the quickest service, but we were not in a hurry. According to my Indian friend it was quite authentic."}
{"text":"Definitivamente regreso a este restaurant Vegetarian thali si eres vegetariano aficionado lo recomiendo. Tai chi tea delicioso. La atencion al cliente lo k esperaba. El tiempo de espera ...no mas de 10 min No tengo nada negativo k comentar. Mi experiencia fue muy grata."}
{"text":"My favorite local Indian cuisine! I've been coming here regularly for the past 3 years to get my Indian food fix and it does the job!  I typically order the Chicken Tikka Masala which is creamy and flavorful with tender chicken! You have your choice of normal Naan or rice. I typically order rice and get a side of garlic naan! Use the Naan to scrap every last bit of your meal. Yum!  Occasionally I'll order the mango Lassi. If you're new to Indian food this is a thick yogurt drink with mango flavor. It's very good but they usually fill me up so be sure to drink them slow so you have room for your meal.   The restaurant itself is in a not so appealing strip mall but the interior is nice and usually clean. Seating is open so feel free to pick a table and the staff with be with you shortly. They are usually very nice and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! This place is so great for lunch dinner and everything else! If I was Richie Rich I would've put this place in my mansion. They just do everything right and the prices are so affordable! I advise everyone who reads this review to go there immediately!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty dreadful and the food is very ordinary. We ordered the Afghan boti, butter chicken, Nehari, with a variety of naan and some Chicken Biryani.  None of the food was tasty resulting in a rather disappointing experience.  The host insisted that they were on the cusp of closing for the day in-spite of us having walked in a whole hour in before they close He even questioned our request for an additional plate and an extra to-go container."}
{"text":"Once again was let down by the quality of food. Each time I've been there, it seems to have degraded. Tikka masala fries were oily and the fries themselves were not crispy/ undercooked. Seekh Kabob and chapli kabob were not very flavorful and the size of the serving seems to have shrunk. The chana puri combo was abysmal. The chana dish was watery and for the Puri, they seemed to have used the naan batter and fried it, so the Puri was more like fried naan! Looks like the only thing they seem to do OK with are chicken items.  I have given them enough chances and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Visited on 11/14/2014 for the first time. Restaurant has a modern look inside and fast serves even though they were short staffed that evening. We ordered the following:  Tikka Masalsa fries $ 5 (Appetizer)  excellent flavors... loved the cheese and crispy fries. TIkka Masala  Shrimp  $ 9 : Served with rice or naan bread  served with a couple of shrimp only but the flavors were good   Traditional Curry Chicken  served with rice or naan bread /// delicious chicken  Cheese Naan  - MUST TRY Delicious !!   Garlic Naan- very tasty  Bill came out to $28 loved the food would come back AGAIN !!  :D"}
{"text":"The food is ok but they are not very skilled or particularly good waiters. Seems as tho all the workers do all the work. Nobody is designated to one spot. This made for a very messy service experience. I was approached twice by two difference people to take my order. One person asked if I wanted a water and forgot right as the other guy saw and said \"ah water\" then brought me the water. After putting in an order they didn't take my menu so the first guy who talked to me asked if I wanted to order again right after I did with the second guy.   If you can stand the mediocre confusing service and the fact that you will have to tell multiple people that you want to order, already ordered, and repeat twice, then you will enjoy some decent food. It is not the best Indian food I have ate before tho, and better places exist with much better service. Also some portion sizes are quite small like the sampler plates and I left not completely full."}
{"text":"We went with the family ordered their mix grill sizzler, this is the 3rd time disappointment  that it was just a chicken tikka and one kabab. There wasn't any other stuff such as behari boti or seekh boti. So better just order a chicken tikka rather their sizzler its waste of money."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian (yeah I know) food I've ever had. However, the service is a hit or miss. One day we can walk in and get seated and helped and served promptly. And literally the next day, or later that day (don't judge), they will take our order and 20 minutes later we find out the they forgot to put it in and we'd have to reorder (there's one specific guy but I don't wanna put him on blast).   It's totally worth it though. Just don't come here on your lunch break or you may have to try to convince your friends that an Indian restaurant is to blame for your getting fired. Trust me. Just kidding. But not really.  If you don't want to be a mainstream bandwagon loser and get the chicken tikka masala like everyone else at your table I'd suggest the hara masala or palak murg.   It would be a game changer if they had a buffet doe"}
{"text":"My chicken kabob was bland.  If it wasn't for the cinnamon it would have been flavorless.  For me a little too much cilantro.  The Naan was very soft,  no crisp at all.  The servers were polite, but no follow up on drinks.   I wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"I stopped in today because I was craving Indian food. This place was very good and hit the spot. I'm a little upset because I live far and now I have to drive all the way back to enjoy it again . The staff was very helpful and the prices were great. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I've had in Arizona. Excellent service and prices!"}
{"text":"I sometimes find the Indian/Pakistani resto choices in Metro Phoenix lacking, some places are good with certain specialties, etc. with Curry Corner, most of their curries and biryanis are on point. For instance their chicken tikka masala consistently tastes great, as well as their Karahi's and the Chicken Achari.   I've been a regular customer the last 10 years, back when Curry Corner occupied a storefront at the corner of Lemon Rd and Terrace and pre-food network fame when it was a go to for Indian international students living nearby. I'm happy that they've grown and have still retained their low prices, and the portions have stayed the same. I like their cheese naan, and the tawa paratha too. Definitely get yourself a mango lassi, it's so refreshing especially when it's warm out."}
{"text":"We saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to go with apprehension. Guy did not steer us wrong! The Goat Karahi was the perfect combination of flavor and heat with a blend of spices. I just placed an order to go while thinking about it. Best in town but if you dont trust my culinary palate then look no further beyond the walls littered with awards.   If you are hungry...Go NOW!"}
{"text":"The food here is so absolutely delicious every time I come to eat I wonder why I don't come every day. We had the nonvegetarian Thali and chicken tandoori. The flavors are complex and delicious. The chicken is incredibly tender. The Naan is just the right texture. I am knocking off a star because what I would like them to do is get a rag and some Windex and clean the place. Especially the bathroom. It's so easy to clean up. Just spend a minute in there. Please."}
{"text":"OMG! Seriously one of the best Paki restaurant EVER. Well that might be me saying that because it was the only place which served me Chapli Kabob lol. But on a serious note i think this place has done really well for themselves even though i think they have a competition only a block away but its always dead. I was in tempe for 2 days and and went there both days. Customer service was great as well. The dude from the TV wasn't wrong. :D Most of their business is from the HUGE Indian and a Pakistani student population by ASU. So if they all love it trust me you will as well."}
{"text":"I heard about Curry Corner through an Indian friend during a conversation about cooking and eating Indian food -- the rich flavor profiles provided by the wide variety of flavorful spices, the necessity of quality in said spices, and the best Indian places in the valley. My friend swore by Curry Corner as his choice for most authentic, so as a huge fan of Indian food (and food in general, let's be real, this is Yelp), I bookmarked it and tried it within the week.  I ordered the lamb tikka masala with naan, which came out of the kitchen after about 10 minutes. At first I thought it would't be enough food, but I suppose I underestimated and left fat and happy. The lamb was choice although some pieces were a bit dry. The naan was fresh out of the oven, buttery and flaky. The tikka masala sauce was excellent and authentic as any I've had.   I do however have to knock down a star for the cup they gave me for water (first of all, the water tasted a little funky), which had some white greasy substance smeared on the side. Pretty gross. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I had finished and was about to leave."}
{"text":"Ok, it was almost  a year since I ate here with my wife but I finally signed up for a Yelp account, so here we go...I have been itching to write a review on this place because it is one of those experiences that had such highs and such lows that it kind of eats away at you.....  We are celebrity chef nerds, and try to eat at places that we see on DDD, Anthony Bourdain, etc.  Visiting from Vancouver, B.C., we were looking forward to this spot.  We come from a city that has one of the worlds best Indian chefs, Vikram Vij.  I also had many Indian neighbours growing up.  Finding tin foil packages on the door step, filled with home cooked Indian food is a treat for sure.  Needless to say, we are well versed in quality Indian/Pakistani food.  I even learned many recipes and cooking methods from our Indian neighbours over the years.  Ok enough back up...  I will try to make it short...  For the most part, the food was great.  The curries/sauces were very flavourful and authentic.  The service was ok.  The server we had was a bit on the lacking food knowledge side.  Or at least how to communicate it in English.  We ended up getting what we wanted, so all was good.  Luckily I can say a few cuisine related words in Indian to help him out.  The one thing that was a HUGE disappointment was the goat.  I LOVE goat.  I have had goat at Vij's that makes you wish you ate goat several times a week. Good goat should be fall off the bone, slightly gamey, and like the best pot roast you've ever had but bettter.  The goat here was so bad, I couldn't eat more than half of it.  It was so chewy and gristly that it was embarrassing.  This was the dish that was featured on DDD, and the reason I thought about this place for months???  There is no way a restaurant should ever put out an ingredient that is so far off from its acclaim.  It's maddening.  The curry/sauce was SO amazing that it made it even more maddening.  I ended up having sauce with naan as a meal.  I may visit here again, but I really hope they take their reputation seriously and not follow the few that suffer the fame-to-fail route.  The sounds from all the reviews since my visit here tells me they might very well be going down that path."}
{"text":"After seeing it on tv we had to go try it. It was delicious. Everything was great. The chicken tandoori was perfect. I will be back and you should come try it !"}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian restaurant in all of Tempe it really is that good. Have the garlic naan and the chicken makhini"}
{"text":"First-time customer. I was so disappointed. I ordered the Tikka Masala Fries as an appetizer. Took forever for them to come out, and by the time they finally come out delivered by somebody besides our waiter, they were cold except for in the middle of the fries. It was clear they had been sitting there for a good long time. So about 2 minutes after we got our french fries we got our food. My daughter got the rice and beef. The beef was so tough that using a fork and pressing down and trying to cut it as hard as I could I couldn't cut it. My goat Curry had sharp little pieces of bone in its. Just bone all by itself, not surrounded by any meat. I could easily see biting down on that and really messing up your mouth. The Taste was okay, and the food was warm so at least there's that. We also had to flag down our server for him to finally bring us our drinks.  They did take off the beef dish from our bill. But all in all, a horrible experience.  Cheese naan was wonderful. Two stars for that."}
{"text":"Poor quality food; I was just passing by PHX and had a dinner here. It's not authentic indo pak restaurant. Will not recommend it. They use poor quality meat."}
{"text":"Curry Corner is absolutely great! As a college student, I love how cheap it is, but the quality is not at all sacrificed. I love their hummus, and I honestly probably get it at least two times a week.  I've been starting to take my friends here, and they love it as well.  The service is usually fast, though I've had to wait a few times, but that's not a big deal at all. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant! This is the best Indian food I have found. I am addicted to Curry Corner. I have tried bariani, chicken masala, simosas, garlic nan bread and so on. Not only is the food amazing but it's a family owned business & they know how to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We had to go. The food is excellent, spicy, and it's awesome that the vegetarian section is just as large as the meat section.   Some of my favorites are the Palak Paneer( freshly chopped spinach greens (palak) cooked with home made paneer (cheese), Aloo Matar (Potatoes sautéed with green peas seasoned with house spices, or the Vegetarian Thali ( 2 vegetable curries and one lentil served with rice, naan, yogurt, and salad).  You can't go wrong at this place. Everything is good. If you don't know what to get, just take a chance and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I started going here about 5 months ago when a friend who lives right near it said it was pretty good.  I do not eat nonkosher meat or poultry, so I was delighted when I saw they have a good amount of fish options with Talapia.  My favorite by far is the fish biryani (fish cooked with rice and a ton of herbs and seasonigns) served with a side of yogurt.  It is absolutely phenomenal and cheap considering the portion size.  I think it costs like 8 dollars.  The amount of seasonings and herbs is what really makes the dish taste so good.    I have also tried the fish curries.  They are pretty good, but I much prefer the Biryani.  My GF usually orders a curry,either fish or vegetable, and she also loves it.  We also order the samosas on occasion, which have a great flavor.  The Naan is also delicious, but I have never really had \"bad\" naan at an indian/paki restuarant, so i do not think that having great naan is a special benefit - rather, if you dont have great naan, i wont be going to the restaurant!  The service is usually slow, but getting better as the restaurant becomes more professional.  I hope they dont lose the home style cooking or low prices as a result of becoming more of a \"real\" restaurant.    Also, Guy Fieri ate there recently for his DDD show and I am very excited to see it!"}
{"text":"Authentic paki Indian food.  Not Americanized/westernized taste like other restaurants.   Service could be better but it adds authenticity of the place."}
{"text":"This little place is great!  Good food and reasonably priced. If want a quick, good, inexpensive meal. Definitely make it a point to try it."}
{"text":"The food tastes great! You can get a lot of food for a fairly low price when you order a thali! The location is good too since it is close to ASU. Their mango lassi is amazing. I would recommend this place to include a paneer veg curry like paneer tikka masala in their veg thali. Also, the service could be better, it seemed like one person was doing all the work - greeting guests, serving food, and working as a cashier."}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended within my little group of friends but Overall wasn't super impressed.  I ordered the tika masala chicken & it was super good one on the best flavored masala sauces I have eaten anywhere.  If only everything on the menu was this good.  My husband ordered goat.    It was mostly grissle and bones.  the little bit of edible meat was dry and tasteless.    Nann is also dry and tasteless.  Prices are expensive.  There is no buffet.  service is terrible (rude, sloppy, listless, and supper supper slow)."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here, a few nights ago, the food was really good.  The problem was the service.  Horrible.  Slow.  I had to ask three times for more napkins.  The waitress got the orders wrong at most of the tables.  We did not get the naan bread we ordered at all until at the last minute they decided we should have some so they brought it to us in foil as we were about to leave.  Never got asked for a refill on my drink.  They really need to raise their game or my next visit will be my last.  Too bad, the food is so good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, each and every time I have gone.  The lamb curry had a good amount of meat and plenty of rice and curry.  I really hope to try the goat next time, last time they were out.  The chicken tikka is juicy, tender and perfectly prepared.  GET THE CHEESE NAN BREAD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! If you want something to help with some of the spicier dishes, I recommend the lassi, especially if they still have strawberry.  This place is my favorite Indian restaurant, and you can't beat the prices  The only issue I have is the servers.  Some are better than others but I feel like the staff spends more time in the back than up in the front (this could be due to a lack of staffing.). Also the less professional servers are not very friendly and are very lackadaisical.  Don't let this divert you from the stellar food."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the show Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives. The Best Tandoori chicken I've ever had. I tried the Salt Lassi, which was not refreshing at all."}
{"text":"If I could i would leave zero stars. I've came here a few times in the past and the experience has been fair. The food is very good, the only problem is the service. The most recent experience 11/9/2017 me and my wife came in for dinner. We were sat down and the server just left and never came back.  About 15 minutes have passed not one employee asked us if we needed a drink or gave us a menu. This was going to be my first meal of the day, so you can imagine how irritated I must have been. A few times the server looked at us. Rather than asking if we needed anything he just went around empty tables to set napkins. Then a new group of people came in and they were  sat down and immediatley asked if they needed water and given a menu....after we have been sitting there for about 20 minutes with no service. They are very selective with how they treat their customers. The food here is amazing but the people of the facility are terrible. I've never experienced this in any resturaunt ever in my life. We got up and left hungry."}
{"text":"This restaurant has average Indian food but the reason why it gets 2 stars is because of thier horrible customer service. Forgetting drinks, naan, and rice. Only bringing them after the meal was finished."}
{"text":"Loved it! Very different but delicious, tried the Tikka Masala Fries (reminds me chilaquiles), Hummus (the best I have had) with Naan (reminds me of homemade flour tortillas), Tandoori chicken, and Goat Karahi. I love spicy food so I did not think the food was spicy at all, I could have used more heat but if you are sensitive to spicy food you might melt. I didn't think the service was bad as others have mentioned. I would come back and would bring friends that like to try different food."}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian food one other time. It was buffet style- ok, but... Curry Corner is a sit down, order from the menu and I simply do not have a metaphor to describe how good it is. We ordered: (spelling?) tandoori  chicken, masala chicken and a thick lentil soup- don't know the name. Our meals came with long grain white rice and nam. The tandoori chicken came sizzling to the table, perfect char, covered with onion and bell pepper slices. It was unspeakably good! The lentils over white rice was a perfect side. The rice was plentiful and steamed (I assume) correctly. The nam was sprinkled with cilantro, there was more than enough and it was amazing! Now for the Marsala chicken. Served boneless in a red sauce, I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It had a flavor that imprints on your mind. Slightly spicy but no way over powering, since I'm a novice with Indian food I am unable to identify the ingredients. Let me also say; in my opinion, when one eats at an 'ethnic' restaurant and 40%+ of the other customers are of that ethnicity, you can pretty much bet you are getting the real thing! My only thoughts on improvement would be the chai tea didn't seem to have the sweetness I'm used to and I like to listen to the music from the country with the food I'm eating- just me... Curry Corner- you win! One more thing before I go; I usually try to take a photo or two but when the food came to the table, photography was the last thing on my mind"}
{"text":"I'm giving the place 4 stars because the ceiling was starting to cave in over our heads from condensation from the A/C. Yes really. It was dripping on our table.   BUT....  The food is phenomenal. We tried a little of everything here and wow. SO fresh, so delicious, and what an experience. If you are not familiar with Indian food, this is a great place to start because once you've had the best, the other restaurants won't matter.  And I hope they've fixed the ceiling since our visit...because a place like this is worth preserving!"}
{"text":"We've had the chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, and garlic naan from here; it was pretty good. Tried ordering from them through uber eats: they gave the uber driver someone else's order to be delivered to me and then tried blaming the driver. Either management pays no attention to anyone walking in and just grabbing wrong orders, or they gave the uber driver the wrong order. They vehemently blamed the driver. When calling to resolve it, their line was \"busy\" for 20 minutes straight and then the phone was passed to another person who had no idea why she was speaking to me. I have never dined in but do not plan to in the future, unfortunately.  P.s. Chicken Tikka Masala Fries are divine but their service has been so terrible that I know longer wish to further give them my money."}
{"text":"You have to go to this little gem, which is hidden in a nondescript strip-mall location.  The location is small and is - for reasons unknown - usually quite empty.  I had the tikka masala (once with chicken, once with lamb) and naan.  Both times I was in tikka masala heaven.  My friend had potatoes in a green sauce (I forget what herb the sauce was made from) - I had a taste and it was also crazy good (especially for a vegetarian dish, which I do not gravitate toward).  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Indian/Pakistani restaurant by far this place has the best lamb biryani. Wow!!! It was amazing full of flavor can't get any better. I also had their Haleem, it wasn't all that but it's worth getting it."}
{"text":"The last time I went to curry corner  the service was terrible. The two girls working on a Wednesday around lunch time didn't even acknowledge we came in. They were busy doing other stuff. That's fine, but then after 10 mins of no one greeting us or taking our drink orders when the restaurant wasn't even at half I decided to leave. The last few times the service has been pretty bad but never this bad where they were just standing around. I talked to one of the waiters from a previous visit, he They told me they don't work off tips. The tips go to the owner. Maybe that's why they didn't seem to care. Food is great, when you actually order. Hopefully this review will help and they will get better service."}
{"text":"Really fantastic food - really.  A little slow on the service, but they were very nice and cheerful!  My only recommendation would be don't be in a hurry. The Arabian Thali was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good Pakistani food! Definitely one of the finer foods in Arizona! I would actually say it's better than most Indian/Pakistani restaurants in LA.  Ibrahim"}
{"text":"Long story short: Food Quality: Very Good Service: Horrible"}
{"text":"I've heard many good thing. Many. Many. Many. I want to thank you yelpers for helping me through the menu. Several of you mentioned the (Goat Karahi) and omg that was good. Fall off the bone meat with a spiciness that I loved. The boyfriend had the (Chicken Tikki Masala), he was done before I could get a bit, so that speaks for it self. For appetizer we had a the (Samosas) and (Tandoori Wings) and we pretty much inhaled both. Yeah inhaled. They took a bit longer to make due to the cooking process but definitely worth the wait. Service was good. Not great. She did the job while juggling seven other tables but I'm a server as well and she knew how to handle this restaurant. When the bill came, I choked a bit because I thought we got under charged. Nope. The food is amazing. It's nothing simple but it will leave you taking a to-go menu and craving more. We'll be back. Yes we will."}
{"text":"If you love food that has lots of flavor then try this place, the variety of spices & herb they use in their dishes are awesome! Also the garlic Naan ( flat bread ) is delicious , definitely coming back again, and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place so much but it doesn't agree with the stomach too much if you know what I mean. Every time I eat here it's an immediate trip to the restroom my girlfriend hates it... little bit of a back story here me and my girlfriend moved in together 3 months ago into her moms basement and I had had curry corner a couple hours prior I went to bed that night and woke up with poop in the bed and I wasn't surprised of course tho I blamed it on her 12 year old son Jason (I hate him) he expects me to be his dad or something idk but yeah I blamed it on him and this place really gives me the sh!ts but overall really good place would give it 5 stars but my girlfriend said no so there ya go"}
{"text":"Went with six of my Friends there. Great tasting food.   Strawberry Milkshake is really tasty. Fries are great. Biryani, Naans, Curris wonderful.    Affordable and Tasty..  Service could be better though."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I love this place prices are fair and portions are large. If this place is lacking anything its a little in the atmosphere department but they have been improving over the years. Food is always great."}
{"text":"Old spinach / tasted very old , no flavor & really bland ! I am having stomach issues already! I won't even serve this to humans ! Paneer was old and tasted like old rubber !!"}
{"text":"This place honestly reminds me of the quality of food I used to get in Chicago. The meat is fresh and the spices are perfect. The Karahi lamb reminded me of my favorite restaurant inchicago Sabri nihari Karahi gosht. Not the exact same but pretty damn good. The handi chicken is also spectacular. Just ask them to make it extra hot if you want a kick. Love this place I'm definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"Sticky seats and sticky floors, but I keep coming back for the delicious food! Specifically, the Tikka Masala Fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the lamb tikka and it was OK. The food was very tasty but it wasn't hot (hot as in \"not warm\"). And It kinda felt like eating homemade Indian food that got microwaved  for 1 minute and 30 seconds and then served to us. Prices are reasonable, $8-$10 for a small bowl of curry and meat of your choice and a big plate of white (flavorless) biryani rice.   Would give 5 stars if: 1) Food was freshly made, 2) Hot and 3) More meat :)"}
{"text":"Food: Outstanding. My family and I ordered a ton of things off the menu, and everything we got (see photos!) tasted heavenly.   Service: On a scale of 1-10, it's somewhere between a 7 and 7.5. One of our servers was kind of cold, and the wait time was a bit long.    Overall, it was still worth every penny, and I'd definitely come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Kelly was awesome, great waiter, friendly and knowledgeable. Food was good but wasn't mind blowing, didn't take too long to be served. Chai tea... was ok. Samoas were pretty good. After Kelly left though our group didn't get taken care of by the relieving waiter... it wasn't even busy in there."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for only a couple years, but have eaten here a couple dozen times. Food is really delicious, but service is subpar. This is the main reason why I only do takeout now, and even then I don't feel like a valued customer. I'll continue to eat the food, but won't eat there because I won't tip a server if I get terrible service."}
{"text":"The vegetarian biryani was great , the palak paneer to die for but then wen I ordered a take home, found tht the food had not been defrosted properly, it was full of nylon, the memory of the incident too strong to revisit curry corner. Have serious doubts about the maintenance since then"}
{"text":"Great food with amazing prices!! The service was good... A little strange because we never actually had one specific server but they were all very friendly!"}
{"text":"First off let me start off by saying... SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! If I could give 0 stars I would. Here are my reasons.  1: No greeting upon arrival 2: Served flat drinks; had to wait 5-10 mins for new drinks  3: Three people who came in after me, were served before me.  4: Waited 35+ Mins for my Appetizer 5: Girl checking me out tried to give me every excuse in the book as to why my food took so long 6: To be \"Nice\" she said she'll take the drinks off the bill for me....    All in all at the end of the day; I felt like me and my girlfriend as people who also work in the food business should've been treated a little bit better; after having to wait 35+ minutes for food, while customers who came in after us were served before my girlfriend and I; I personally felt like our whole bill should've been comped out due to the certain circumstances we had to deal with."}
{"text":"I want to give them a 3... interior is a 1... food is a 4..... BUT! They earn the extra 1 point because the food is good... AND! They're open til 11pm and satisfy the late night cravings.  Wouldn't take your first date here.. but damn it's good!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Perhaps from the time when I first gave them a call to confirm they are open before coming in?  It was close to 3.30pm on a Saturday and I called the restaurant to confirm that they are open before driving 15 minutes to come here. I asked \"Hi.. Are you open now?\" The guy, with a perplexed tone responds \"Why?\"  Whyyyy??? Whyyyyyyy?? Really? That was the first red flag to turn away. But I didn't because I wanted to give them a second chance.  They got us seated right next to the entrance where tons of people were walking by. It was annoying, so we asked the waiter to move us to another booth at the far end of the restaurant.  He said he'll accomodate our request after cleaning up the table. We waited, waited and waited. 15 minutes passed. The other table was not cleaned yet. And nobody came to our table to take our order. Everytime we tried to flag somebody down to take our order, we heard \"Just one minute\".. Several minutes passed and nobody showed up to take our order.  Finally, we noticed that the other table that we wanted to move to, had been cleaned. So, we just walked over and told the waiter \"We are going there\".  And then waited for another 10-15min before some guy came by to take our order. We got Tikka Fries, Chicken Curry, Chicken Tikka Naan, Garlic Naan and Veggie Biriyani.  The chicken tikka naan was terrible. Likewise, the garlic naan. There was hardly any garlic on it.  The chicken curry was mediocre at best. While serving the veggie biriyani, the waiter said \"Here's your chicken vegetable biriyani\". We went \"Woah woah wait.. Is it chicken or veggie biriyani. We ordered veggie, and you said it was chicken veggie biriyani\". His response \"No no, this is veggie biriyani\". IDIOT  After requesting for water (without ice) multiple times, we were served water with ice. And obviously we told him \"We asked for water without ice\". He says \"Oh ok, sorry\" and leaves the glasses right there.  Made a mistake by ordering salted lassi and yeah, you could clean your bathroom with whatever they got. It was not lassi and it was inedible."}
{"text":"My friend heard about this place through the Food Network and we decided to get lunch here one day! The food was quite delicious, and the staff accommodated how I wanted to bring a cake in for my friend. The only downside would be how we attempted to order certain items, just to be told over and over that they could not make any at the time."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here & is one of my favorites. We were in today & my husband ordered the tandoori wings & they were not cooked. The owner even came out & we showed her. I believe that if you can't eat the food you should not have to pay for it. That is not good business! The chicken was not cooked through!! They still made us pay for it. Very unfortunate as we are regular customers. I am giving it 3 stars for this reason & not 5."}
{"text":"Very deceiving from the outside, but the food was very unique! It's rare to find a place that sells delicacies from Pakistan or Afghanistan. I tried the goat dish. The meat was very tender, though a bit fatty, but I didn't mind since it was very flavorful. It was stewed in a thick and flavorful sauce. You get either naan or basmati rice with the dish, but we got both. Our meal ended with clove-infused rice pudding... which was addicting! Our server was very friendly and had good recommendations. There is no ambiance, so don't go expecting a classy atmosphere. This place is for people that appreciate good and unique food. Looking forward to trying more off of their amazing menu!"}
{"text":"Good service, for me any how. I like the design of the restaurant. The food came out beautifully.  The portions were generous both of our entrees were only $8 so that was nice as well. We had been here before I had a yelp so I am glad to give them the 5 stars they deserve."}
{"text":"It took me a year and a half to make it back to Curry Corner. Things really changed! The menu is still the same, but the entire decor is much nicer. This is definitely a restaurant I'd recommend to people. I hate that I happen to live in West Phoenix and don't get to come here very often as it's rather affordable.  Hosts/servers could use a little more training. It's customary to check in on someone a little after they've gotten their food. You want to make sure people's drinks are never empty."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. Quite an easy fix - hire people who actually want to work."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. Hands down the best Northern Indian / Pakistani food in Phoenix. It's a family run place owned by actual Pakistanis, and the food is definitely served for their palate not for wimpy Americans. They don't ask you how spicy you want it. It comes one way: the real way.  For the person whining about hygiene and cleanliness because they got \"food poisoning\": Maybe you just couldn't take it. Go find a McDonalds. They're very clean."}
{"text":"I first came here in 2014 and I thought the food was pretty good, however when I ordered take-out about a month later they totally skimped on the amount of paneer and since I loathe dishonestly I vowed not to come again. However since I am employed at the University and often dine with co-workers who wish to come here, I have been here two additional times, once in late 2015 and once this month (2016).  In 2015: 1) My food was mediocre 2) One guy was acting as host/waiter and was extremely rude 3) Food took forever to come out even through they weren't busy 4) My coworker's specialty drink never came  On the most recent trip things were even worse.  1) My dish was terrible 2) One woman was acting as hostess/waitress so no one was in front-of-the-house for 5 minutes while we waited to be seated 3) My coworker's meal was below average for such a popular dish; and the chicken in the curry was fatty 4) It took 15 min. for water to arrive and was never refilled and we were not given napkins (had to get up to get them ourselves)  5) One sauce on the table was extremely low and the was other dirty (they had just opened) 6) Coworker's tea came out about 40 minutes after being seated and tasted more like cream than tea.  It appears that the owner's of Curry Corner are trying to ride the Diner's Drive-ends and Dives wave from 2013 while cutting corners and pushing out poor food and shitty service post-production."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy Indian food, and my boyfriend's mom saw this place on TV and suggested we go try it, which I am glad we did!   When we first pulled up, the place from the outside does look a tad scary... and we were questioning how this visit was going to go. But once you get inside the place looks fine, the waiters are very friendly, and let you pick a table to sit at. Not a bad start.  We ended up ordering a few things to try which included: Lamb tikka masala, tandoori chicken, cheese naan, and a medium curry called Jalrezi with chicken (my fave). We got some with rice, and others with more naan to try too.   I don't remember the wait being bad, but I do remember how delicious the food was. I admit, I was skeptical after thoroughly reading about this place and the reviews online; however, I am pleased to say my boyfriend and I loved it. Price ended up being better than I expected too, especially after ordering what felt like a feast.  Maybe I have good luck with trying new places, but this to me is a good find and worth my time!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this was on Food Network. Chicken was fatty and dark meat in curries. The best parts of the meal were the nan bread and the rice."}
{"text":"food is soooooooooooo good!!!! it's ok if you don't want to try this place... more for us!!  i'm coming back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I have been here twice, now..the first time just randomly chose the chicken achari, and was completely amazed, the flavors exploded across my palate, with the subtle heat in the finish, was like nothing I've ever experienced. I upgraded to the potato naan, which is mashed potatoes stuffed between two delicious pieces of grilled bread..my second time, I got the curry sampler, combo thingy..three different curries, pickled onions, naan, and yogurt sauce..this is the way to go..always upgrade to the potato naan! The combo said it came with a desert on the menu, but not in reality..still the cold leftovers were a perfect finish.."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian food, and it wasn't bad! Not my favorite style of food, but everything was cooked thoroughly and had a fresh taste! We also received some type of pita bread with some cilantro dip and it was phenomenal. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Very bad stale food .. Went there with great expectations as they are featured on food network but huge disappointment !! Ordered chicken tikka which was bland and tasteless and curry which has no flavor and lots of oil ! Even naan bread was old and stale !! Won't go back !"}
{"text":"This restaurant would be 5 stars in my book if I could eat there. Have never not been able to eat at a restaurant before because it was too cold to even be bearable.  But I can no longer eat here and neither can two of my friends.  So sad because we loved curry corner.  Please make the room temperature warmer!  Update:  Thank you, Curry Corner!  It has been much warmer for years now and we so enjoy your food and staff.  I forgot I had written this review until today.  The Chicken Makhani is exquisitely spiced!"}
{"text":"For anyone visiting the Phoenix metro, love Indian food, or consider them self a foodie, this is a must try! I've been coming here since 2011 and there's no other restaurant I've ate at more than here (except for Chipotle and Chic-Fil-a) during my time as an undergrad. I do miss their old prices but am very happy they have expanded.  Food is still amazing as always. I've tried almost everything except for the vegetarian list and a few other items. The yogurt mango lassi is delicious - sweet, creamy consistency, and refreshing. The chicken Tikka Masala with rice and garlic naan is a must - I've heard it's not made like \"traditional\" ways, but I've tried multiple takes of this at various of different restaurants (maybe it depends what region of Indian you compare it to? this version is absolutely the best). The chicken tikka masala has a perfect mix of Indian spice in a tomato base and cream. I always love it when they add an extra kick to it. You can ask for extra meat (not sure if they charge though. I've never paid attention).  Other things to get are the mixed grilled sizzler is. This is good as well, especially if you're really big on meat portions. I usually get lamb briyani every now and then. Honestly, I can go on for days! The service is not over the top amazing, but they're good people. However, everything on the menu will rock your taste buds."}
{"text":"If I could customize my diet 85% of it would consist of naan bread and egg rolls.  The potato naan here is my manna. The other dishes are solid representations from the mystical sub continent.  I do wish the chicken used in their tika masala was less Gandhi and more meat."}
{"text":"Ok, the place is simple. Nothing too fancy.   Servers were ok. Not so friendly but it didnt bother me.  Presentation of the food was alright, but the flavors were really good! I couldnt stop munching on the garlic and especially the cheese naan bread! Currys were tasteful! All of our orders turned out great! Im happy with the tastes!   I would recommend this to anyone. I have three stars only cuz i expected more cuz of watching the show. Would i come back for more in the future? I would say so! This is a good place to eat traditional food!"}
{"text":"We went because of Diners drive ins and dives.  We did not get the food he got even though we ordered the same thing.  Ours wasn't tasty the order was smaller and even a different color. The place wasn't clean, dirty floors, sticky table edges.  Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Love the food. Their service is friendly. They are usually busy when I come in so there's a wait but nothing too excessive. The cheese naan is amazing! Definitely one of my favorite places!!"}
{"text":"We'd seen this place before, but this time the restaurant we planned to visit was closed(!!).  So we walked over here.  Some interesting dishes on the menu that I am not familiar with.  I like that.  We ordered chicken rajisthani, hara masala chicken, and samosas.  The samosas were of a reasonable size, and they give three of them.  They were very tasty.  Simple, but tasty.  The other dishes were served like stews in bowls.  The portions were reasonably large.  The flavors of each were unique.  I've never had either before.  I liked them both.  Very good.  We were pleased with our choices.  This will be on our short list of places to visit when we want sub-continent food (Indian/Pakistani)."}
{"text":"The food is good, but a little bit too much Mexican food fusion here. Each table has two types of hot sauce-- the red rooster sauce and a straight habanero sauce. What's the deal?  It's worth coming back though, since prices are around $8 on average and mango lassi is $2.50.  Just... don't expect an authentic Indian food experience."}
{"text":"We went to curry corner today. No one to receive us. No one to serve food. The waiters were totally negligent and don't care about the customers. We waited for 10 minutes for the Order and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST Indian food I have ever had. We had the Tikka Masala fries which were to die for..tasted like an indian version of chili cheese fries. We also ordered the Chicken Makhani...which was recommended to me by the owner who was featured on triple d's. The Makhani was perfect curry. Creamy richness with a slight spicy kick. Being from NYC and the tri state area, this place has perfected indian food to the finest."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here! My fiance and I recently moved here from out of state and found this place on Yelp. We moved here from a small town (he is originally from southern India) and we were excited to see so many different restaurants with culture and flavor. We have been to Curry Corner twice and have eaten the samosas, tikka masala, lamb biryani, chicken makhani and aloo tikki. We have had these dishes with both rice and naan and on both visits the food was excellent! The portions aren't huge, but we have had leftovers each time, and they don't overprice. The service provided by the wait staff has been very friendly and prompt. The decor and seating leave something to be desired but the food itself was great. We will return and soon!!"}
{"text":"I think I hyped up Curry Corner too much in my head before visiting. I had been salivating over the photos of the masala fries for quiet sometime so I was thrilled to finally try them out. Sadly, my expectations were shattered in a bad way. The fries were cold by the time we received them and they were kind of soggy from the sauce. Also, I noticed they were missing the green garnish that is shown in lot of other photos.   Service was spotty from the start. It took a while for us to be sat. Then, it took a while for the food to come out and finally, it took a long while to pay the bill. For some unknown reason, all of the staff seemed to be back in the kitchen area. So glad we came on a weekend and did not need to be anywhere in a rush because the visit took much longer than necessary.   When our food did come out, we were brought two plates when we had only ordered one. This lead to an awkward conversation trying to explain that we only ordered one. However the waitress proceeded to tell us that we had ordered two. Mistakes do happen but arguing with customers about it does not make the situation any better.   Our waitress also never asked what spice level we wanted and some of the vegetarian plate was a little spicier than I would have preferred. Towards the end of the meal the owner/manager came by to check on us which was appreciated but a little too late.   Overall the food was okay but due to the service I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"F%#* me this ish was good! I came because I saw it on diners drive in with that dude who looks like he can't decide what era or genre he belongs to but is still cool. I had the Tika masala fired. Bomb. Tandori chicken. Bomb. Bread. Bomb. I pulled off some chicken, threw it in the bread and wrapped that bird up like a little burrito in honor of my people. Place is on point and good price. Worth the trip I'll be back."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indo-Pac food in Arizona, but don't just take my word for it. When I started coming here they were a 2 star joint and all the reviews complained about slow service, cramped dinning rooms and long wait times, but I went on an off night when I expected that not too many people would be in. We had an amazing meal.   Since then, they have expanded the dinning area by double and have hired more hands to take and deliver orders...That should put those 1 and 2 stars to rest. Now about what makes them a 5 star place and really, the only Indian food place you need to have on speed dial.   Their Tikka Masala is absolutely divine. I use this dish as my litmus test...If the masala is garbage, chances are the rest of the dishes follow...But this place...Holy mother of all things great and small. It is one of the best dishes they have on the menu. The chicken is tender, the sauce nice and warm, creamy and so aromatic. Couple this with some of their garlic naan and you have a dish that puts you halfway to Nirvana.  Other dish recommendations: the Chicken Jalfrezi (my wife's words on this one) was \"a transcendent experience\". She allowed me a few bites and it was mind blowing. The peppers and onions, the meat slow cooked into spicy mouthfuls of beauty...Think I am overplaying my hand? Friggin try this place.  If none of this sways you, let me put it this way. I came here once. It is now my only Indian restaurant. I tell everyone I meet about it and it becomes their ONLY Indian restaurant. One try and you will see why I sing this place's praises to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"Excellent good and service. I had the grill sampler and all the meats were very good. My wife had the chicken tikka masala and it was the best Pakistani food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've tasted way better. The meal was lukewarm and could have used additional salt.  Selection is very limited. Usual menu items were missing. No chicken Vindaloo. Where they do that at??  Low authenticity as well. No regular spicy chili sauce thing; instead, they had cholula and Tabasco. OutOfPlace.com.  Prices are amazing though."}
{"text":"Hype for no reason. Service is ok, food is alright. I expected more after hearing about Curry Corner. There are far better options in the area."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here on Uber eats a couple times & they don't ever seem to take their delivery customers seriously. I've had a few occasions where I've made a certain request to add a certain vegetable to my curry and they don't listen, or they don't put the sauces that belongs with my appetizer. I've had missing Togo forks n knives it's just very annoying when they don't value returning or first time customers!!!!"}
{"text":"My experience here left me disillusioned and feeling like a second class citizen. When I walked in, I waited for someone to get me a table. I was ignored. I waited 10 minutes. I start searching for someone to help me.  Finally found someone.   I was abruptly asked \"for here or to go\" and was told to go grab my own menu, of which I had a lot of trouble finding in this messy place. I sat myself since nobody bothered seating me.   I ordered veggie biriyani and a mango lassi to go. I waited. And waited. And waited. No one made eye contact with me or acknowledged me. No one tried to assure me that I wasn't forgotten or tried to keep me happy with my mango lassie or at least a glass of water.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I caught eye contact with someone flagged him down. He came up to me and told me that my food would be out shortly. Perhaps he picked up on my frustration.  Food came out, after waiting even longer. I was given a ridiculous excuse as to what happened, which I will not even bother to mention. I paid and took my food home. I was unhappy with the veggie biriyani. The menu stated that it has fragrant saffron and other spices. I did not taste or smell a trace of saffron. It was dry and bland. To top it off, there were a couple of pieces of chicken in my VEGETARIAN rice. I am never coming back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, dining in and taking out. I come back for the food, but the service is driving me away. There has not been one time where they did not mess up the order, and the wait has always been trying."}
{"text":"Food is good. But the service is terrible. Probably the worst among all restaurants I have been to here in Arizona."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I found this place off Diner drive inn and dives. This place has some of the best curry in Tempe that I've had only problem is the service is always so slow to the point you don't even want the food anymore. I recommend calling in for pick up because you might get so upset at the slow service that you may not even enjoy the food. Overall I love curry corner though!"}
{"text":"Worst paneer tikka masala I have ever had. Had half of my food n left. Couldn't evn finish, it was that bad!!!  My friend ordered biriyani and Saag chicken it wasn't good either !! Oh and I forgot to mention the tikka masala was cold , uncooked , tasteless , salt less and very very watery !! Worst experience ! Nva coming back !!"}
{"text":"Good tikka masala fries. Had lamb curry and chicken Korma. Just ok. Pretty spicy and tasted the same. Probably won't come back. Really needed a refill on my soda and was never offered one. Waitress didn't hear my request in passing me."}
{"text":"There are a few times in your life when you have a baaad feeling about a place...Peeling plastic off of the menus, peeling plaster off the walls, filthy kitchen (which I mistook for the entrance to the restaurant before being shooed out) for starters.  Ordered some staple, vegetarian dishes. I think the food was watered down from a previously frozen and very likely refrozen dishes. There still was the distinct aftertaste of freezer burn...  I'm falling sick even a few hours after...bloating, nausea, and a general sick feeling.   Avoid this restaurant like the plague."}
{"text":"YES to the samosas. They are flavorful, steamy hot, and come with a delicious sauce. NO to the curries - ha, go figure. Unless you like liquidy, oily, flavorless broth with chunks of meat inside. Also, NO to the water. It tastes very chlorinated.  Note the door on the left is STUCK so don't be discouraged and try, try again!"}
{"text":"Tikka masala fries are amazing!!!!! Crunchy mushy spicy sweet = wow  Everything else was just ok"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Everything is like 8 bucks on the menu, so you don't have to worry about ordering something \"cheaper\".  The portions are very reasonable and the curries are very flavorful... add some of their naan to your meal and you're set.  This place was on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives a couple years ago, so that also adds to their credibility (in my opinion, that's really cool)."}
{"text":"After months off trying to make it here. I was let down.  Service from the beginning was not good. Server obviously didn't not want to be their. We mentioned it was our first time and he was just like Ok... Food was not as flavorful as I would have thought. Not everything you see on TV is what it is. Owell..... And no Chai tea and it was 3pm.... Maybe it was Because they were a bit busy maybe I'll give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Took me forever to finally leave the comforts of Phoenix to check out Curry Corner.  My only regret, not coming sooner!  Super close, right next to ASU.  Fast, friendly service.  Some of the best garlic and cheese stuffed naan around.  Had the chicken tikka, lamb, biryani and of course a mango lassi.  Like many family owned gems, the décor isn't fancy.  I was a little worried that they would rest on their DD&D laurels like some restaurants do, but I am eagerly looking for another excuse to head back and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"First and maybe last time at this place. First off my friend brought some food she ask for mild food. Everything down to the spinach with cheese was spicy. The naan was burnt up. The cheese in the spinach was burned. We actually took it back and we sat there for a good 20 minutes. The owner did compensated us with a free entree and was nice about the situation from the time we walked in. My friend got the new naan (not knowing I had the old burnt stuff) and I guess they heated up the burnt naan and put it back in the foil... And I guess they warmed up the spinach with cheese as well... but my question is who gives someone back burnt food?!?... To manager- Don't bother with apologizing on this review as well..."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Curry Corner and we were very satisfied with the service and the food was absolutely delish!!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for Indian food in the Scottsdale/Tempe Area. The food is always excellent - the lamb karahi is absolutely worth the extra wait time! Downside is the dine-in service is non-existent. I like my Indian food very spicy but good luck getting more than 1 water refill during your meal. Kitchen plays their music too loud so you get a strange mix of mariachi and Indian music playing over each other. Order to-go and you'll be very satisfied though"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Our first time having Pakistani food so we didn't know what to order, but we were lucky and met Shawn who gave us a quick explanation of everything and even gave us an excellent recommendations on the food. My husband got the Goat/Lamb  Punjabi Handi (Goat stew) and I got the chicken Tikka masala; both were DELICIOUS. They were served with rice and Naan,  yummy yummy!  Service is great and fast. Prices are more than fair. If you like to try new food and spices, this is your place, be adventurous. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the service as I never got to order. I stood at the door and was ignored numerous times by people walking in and out of the kitchen. When I finally asked to be seated, it seemed like they were being bothered or surprised by my request. After I sat down wherever I wanted, it was quickly evident that I wouldnt be served any time soon, so I just left."}
{"text":"Tikka Masala Fries, chicken Tikka Masala, and cheese naan! All amazing! Didn't necessarily care for the yogurt drink, but that could just be my taste. My friend usually orders a vegi dish and enjoys. We always have leftovers and it tastes even better the next day! The service could be a little faster, but... hasn't stopped me from going back countless times! They are always very sweet!"}
{"text":"This was GREAT Indian food. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and is definitely in a divey location, but wow. First off, order the fries with masala sauce. Seriously, trust me. They were double fried and so crispy they all but shattered when you looked at them, but doused in delicious sauce and feta cheese. I'm pretty sure I could have eaten that and called it an entire meal. The garlic naan wasn't as garlicky as I could have hoped, but it was tasty anyways. All of the rest of the food was delicious, and the service was friendly. Only thing I was missing was the little dish of spices on the way out the door. It always helps settle my stomach after a heavy meal. Nice big parking lot here, which is great right off campus."}
{"text":"Food is ok, prices are good, but service is horrible....  The taste of same item is different each time. It's better to order for a pick up, rather than dine in. Have tried their BBQ chicken, biryani, nihari and a couple of more items. Food tastes better but not very authentic."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Very authentic and great hummus! Hard to find good hummus outside of Israel but this is good. Everyone must try!"}
{"text":"Sub-par food, as in the food left me feeling still hungry for Indian food the next day because I was left very unsatisfied. Waitstaff here is the real problem though: Rude, lazy, and acted as though everything my group asked for or ordered was the absolute last thing they wanted anything to do with. Didn't bring us the bill  for 20 minutes and when we asked for the bill they were just like \"you pay up front.\" No sign saying that.  Would not recommend, as there are WAY better places in Tempe for Indian food and the experience at those restaurants is much better. Try Delhi Palace."}
{"text":"Food: Indian Food Staff: Friendly and helpful Atmosphere: Small little restaurant, but plenty of seats for everyone.   Parking: There is plenty of parking because it is located in a strip mall, but if you are coming along Apache from the west you'll have to make a U-turn down the road.  I've been traveling a lot lately and when I do I have a tendency to watch a lot of Food Network shows.  This place was on an episode of Diner, Drive-ins, and Dives the week before I was going to be in town so I decided to drop in.  Whenever I try a new Indian place I go with the standard Chicken Tikka Marsala and garlic naan.  Since I decided to dine in, I also got a mango lassi to cool down the sauce if needed.  When the dish came out, it seemed like there wasn't much chicken in the dish, but it was really hiding under the sauce.  The sauce had a nice spice to it, I would say closer to hot than warm.  The mango lassi came in handy.  The sauce was also extremely smooth, almost as if it had been processed.  I'm also guessing they finished it off with a touch of butter to give it a nice silky texture.  The garlic naan was good, but had a slight after taste of something.  I'm guessing it was the fuel they used in their oven to cook it, but I can't be sure.  The mango lassi was okay.  The texture was good, but I had hoped for a bit more mango flavor.  So, back to the sauce.  The sauce was so good, that I decided to order a cheese naan to dip in it.  It was good (turned it into an Indian pizza), but the cheese naan is bit heavy.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive and alway kept my water full.  Overall it was good and would be in my top three Indian places.  I'll be back and I'll have to dry the garlic naan and mango lassi again to see if it improves, if so, it would be five stars from me.  Ordered Dish: - Chicken Tikka Marsala - Garlic Naan  - Cheese Naan - Mango Lassi"}
{"text":"I really cannot overstate how good this place is. Every dish we tried was better than the next. A big dude named Omar took our order and he could not have been friendlier, and considering this place was on Triple D a few nights before, it was so cool how appreciative he was of our business. So, the food and service are great...what else is there? Oh yea three of us ate like Pakistani royalty with plenty of leftovers for $35. That's why I gave a rare five stars."}
{"text":"Really great food, my favorite is the veggie wrap and the chicken masala is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is a HIT OR MISS spot. Some days you will get exceptional food and other days you will get horrible, over watered curry. This place is basically designed for students who barely understand or care for quality food. Their menus condition looks like they were in a dumpster for weeks, Nasty, sticky and dirty. Now imagine how your food is being cooked in the back if the items in the front are so terrible. Dont make a mistake on dining in on weekends. Packed restaurant with 2 servers? You will wait hours for food and service. Its not like these guys are not making money but the quality is not improving."}
{"text":"A small place, the food is great. The curry fries are fantastic and a must order! The staff is friendly and the decor is very cozy in an authentic traditional way.  I really enjoyed Curry Corner and will likely come back again"}
{"text":"I have only had one lunch meal here - the thali. I can surely say their menu is reasonably priced but, the taste of the food is below average. The meats were indeed cooked to perfection but, the just wasn't great. Very controlled use of oil/fat which is another plus. I will update this as I try a couple more items."}
{"text":"Amazing, addicting Indian food! My husbands favorite is the chicken makhani and my favorite is the tikka masala.  The tikka masala sauce is very inconsistent (assuming based on different chefs) but good every time!  Delicious garlic naan!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place because we like to try new things. He asked if they had any alcoholic beverages and they said no but he can go next door and buy alcohol there and bring it on. I thought that was really cool. I ordered the tandoori chicken masala and my friend ordered the mixed grill sizzler. I also got the garlic naan. I can't even begin top say how delicious the food is. My friend has since give back three times. Is a little far for me but I need to make time to go and eat there. I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food !! I cant tell ya all of what we had but i can tell ya it was amazing !! The potato naan was soooo yummy !! The tikka marsala chicken was wonderful ! The other things i dont know the name of were out of this world ( i will try to update with their names soon cuz u need to know :)   They forgot the toppings on the tikka marsala fries though :( didnt know till we were home to my sisters ..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The price was very reasonable as well.  The manager is the one that actually served us.  She was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Very poor service, after waiting 20 minutes my order was totally wrong, and after another 10 minutes I got my food and the chicken I have ordered was not even cooked all pink from inside never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food!  The waiters are patient even though they don't really seem like they want to be there. Check out is super fast. Food comes quick. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here because we saw it on triple D. Great food home- like vibe."}
{"text":"The food was ok. But the service was horrible!!! Phone manners were not good. Then when we went to pick up the order we waited  10 minutes and when she handed us our food it was COLD!  Not happy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was not at all worth 3.5 stars as rated in yelp. Really bad service, the server was getting irritated as we were asking for stuff. We ordered biryani and curry, and specifically mentioned for the biryani to be served after the curry. Still they served biryani before and when asked to bring it later, they got irritated and made faces.  Ridiculous service. Arrogant servers.  Treat your guests wisely!!"}
{"text":"First off, I didn't see any of the service issues some of the other reviews complained about.   The food wasn't bad, it just was not good. Both of the curry type dishes my party had were extremely oily but still somehow bland. The rice had a strange after taste to it - not exactly bad but I didn't enjoy it. The mean was entirely too soft, there was no crispness or flakiness at all. The kebab was actually flavorful, but very dry.  It's not all bad though. The tandoori chicken was excellent; flavorful and moist. The service was good, especially considering there was only one server there, and I really enjoyed my strawberry lassi. Oh, and they brought out some pepper flakes for us after asking if they could bring something to make it spicier.  Probably not going back. There are better places to get Indian food."}
{"text":"I was here last night with Apache Eats and I loved the food. Everything had a nice heat to it and a very nice flavor. The hummus consistancy was great. I really can't think of anything to be critical about. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be better based on reviews but I guess not. You enter in through the hookah place next door and you are obligated to get your own drinks. I love Indian food, I make it at home all of the time but sometimes I like to venture out. The lowdown:  *I got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt. *Mattar paneer also needed salt and spice, I thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?No creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be.  *My partner's lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top. The biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly, if not all fat.  *Basmati rice needed salt as well, and I'm not a salt fiend! More oil would have helped to make it moist.  *Garlic Naan was crispy and hot.  In conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good. I was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had. If you want one of the best experiences go to Royal Taj here in Tempe, if you want some of the best Indian food in your life go to Delhi Palace in Flagstaff at Woodlands Village."}
{"text":"We dined in this restaurant last Sunday and everything was great during that visit. We liked the food so much that we decided to come here again for dinner today. Unfortunately the experience was utterly disappointing this time. We ordered right after we were seated as we knew exactly what to order. Our order included 2 Tandoori Chicken Tikkas, one Reshmi kabob, one sizzling platter and one Tikka masala fries. The fries didn't take long to be served and they were okay. We had to wait for another 45 minutes for the rest of the food to be served. Upon my reminder, I was told that since we ordered all grilled menu items, it was taking long. I also reminded about how we were not even served water which was provided right after.  When our food was finally served and we started eating, we noticed that the quality and taste was not even close to how it was last time. Above all the Tandoori chicken Tikkas were raw from inside- something I wasn't all all expecting considering the amount of time it took to show up at the table. It seems like the owner doesn't come to the restaurant anymore and has made her kids and a couple of his college friends in-charge. The service and quality of the food used to be much better when she was here. It wasn't even that busy today otherwise I would have given them some benefit of the doubt. While paying for the meal, I complained about the rawness of the chicken so they 'graciously' didn't charge me for one order of chicken tikka. I did pay for the rest of the meal and even added 15% gratuity. I would strongly advise the owner to be managing/cooking herself if she wanted her loyal customers to keep coming to her restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here late at night after a road trip near closing time - the staff was very accommodating and allowed us to dine in even though they were doing take=out only at that point.  The mango lassi was excellent - a little bit on the sweet side (I usually like it a little tart), but tasted like it was made from real mangoes rather than the prepackaged stuff. The chicken boti was some of the best I've tasted - the meat was juicy and fully flavored, and the spiced onions complement it nicely.  Though the atmosphere seems like it's geared towards the college crowd from nearby ASU, Curry Corner is a great place to get a nice filling meal, and I'd definitely consider coming back if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times. It is much cheaper than the other Indian restaurants around.  I love their Biryani.I think they serve the best biryani in Tempe. The staff is also friendly. Although, the place is small, It is clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Food is priced like it is amazing, but it's actually pretty mediocre. If you want to delete your wallet on mediocre food this is the place for you.   Service is slow also but the staff is nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. A hidden gem. Service could improve a bit, however with a name like curry corner I think everyone knows what you are getting into."}
{"text":"This place is so awkward.... my friend and I wanted to get Indian food so he suggested me this place. We came in and got greeted by this rude waiter who took us forever to seat us even though there were plenty of seats empty. What made it awkward was that this place was completely SILENT... the only noise were the people whispering and quietly talking, so we decided to do take out instead. We tell the waiter we changed our mind to take out and he got annoyed at us... but the food is overall delicious, just work on the customer service and the environment of your restaurant."}
{"text":"Appetizers never came. The food like bas a water added to the Tika masla and was served. I would avoid coming again. It wasn't a busy day, so no excuse."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Their tikka masala is SOO good.  Their chicken makhani is really good too. The rice is like eating a cloud - so light, fluffy.  I've come here almost 20+ times since I moved to Tempe."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  However, disappointed that 50% of the time they are \"all out of Chai tea\"!  Food price and service is reasonable."}
{"text":"Easily, the BEST Indian food I have EVER had! The service is always hit or miss... But for the food, it's always worth it... ALWAYS!!!   My go to dish is the Chicken Hara Masala! It's SOOO spicy. SOOO savory. And SOOO yummy. I prefer it with Nann, as opposed to rice, but that's because I will eat both and I prefer Nann... However, I can eat the plain rice by itself, and be content - that's how damn good this place is!  This is easily the best place in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place is always yummy.  It is small and not the fanciest.  But the flavors of the dishes make up for it.     Also i think the food is halaal."}
{"text":"The Pakistani food is great. has that great home cooked taste to it...we tried the daal, gosht karahi, chicken pulao, chaana puri and veggie thali. it was amazing the service is great and food is well priced. Definitely made my last day in ARizona a happy one"}
{"text":"Food is great, very authentic and huge portions. But the service is a little bit lacking.    Came here to get some Indian Pakistani food and was impressed by the prices and the value we got. We ordered a vegetarian masala and a chicken masala to share. All the dishes were very authentic flavorful and tasty. we got a side order of rice and naan, the naan was perfect. The Musala fries was loaded with sauce and cheese, surely will give you a nice heart attack, but do not worry about that when the flavors are exploding in your mouth. The lamb Punjabi Handi was also very tasty and full of flavors, but the lamb meat was overcooked and very dry. For $9, it was a good deal. I also got the sweet lassi, which is the yogurt drink and loved it.   The service was definitely lacking and our waiter never came back to check on us. parking was very easy in the strip mall lot and the bathrooms were decently clean."}
{"text":"This place is Halal, if Halal translates to terrible food.   I knew this was going to be a bad experience after my first sip of the unfiltered tap water the waitress brought out. To get the taste of ecoli out of my mouth I ordered a mango lassi which proved to as flavorful as dish detergent with stevia. People often say, figuratively, 'this left a bad taste in my mouth,' this drink makes you say it literally. We just couldn't wait for our chicken tikka masala to come out, but that too proved to be disappointing. Our mouths had no refuge as we sipped the mango to get the chicken out of our mouths and then back to our sewer water.   At the time of going here, this place was listed 5/5 stars on nearly every site we searched. I figured out why, as half way through the meal, the resutraunt because busier and busier. Every single person in the restaurant seemed as if this was their first indian food experience. It took nearly 10 minutes for the waitress to bring us the check after we asked for it. Another 10 minutes to come pick it up and process it so we could get the heck out of there."}
{"text":"I got the Afgani Boti   I ran in here with a friend to get lunch to go, the restaurant is very small and cute. I think that this is the best Indian food I have had, staff was very friendly. The dish I got  has a very fresh taste and the cilantro is very apparent. I will definatly recommend and be back when I am in the area again! LOVE IT"}
{"text":"We decided to try it after Guy Fieri s recommendation. They only had two servers - which made service slow. For appetizers we ordered the aloo tiki. My husband enjoyed it. I found it too salty. I ordered the sheesh kebab. It was dry and overcooked. I only ate the rice.  At check out, they took it off the bill.  My husband vegetarian thali was to die for. Delicious!! I kept stealing fork fulls of his food."}
{"text":"This is specifically for people with stomach issues and totally my subjective review for those that may share my issues. The chicken based dishes here are extremely spicy, I guess because they don't marinate them without chili and use the same chicken for most curry dishes. Hence even requested at mild, it gets extremely hot- I could only wonder how hot it gets when they add extra chili. I do eat hot food occasionally, but only here,  out of the 3 times I have had these people's food in the last 2 yrs, I get super acid reflux for days after , and iam pretty healthy and fit otherwise- so learnt my lesson finally. What really pissed me off is that I specifically ask them NO spice/ hot, and I get this every time.   Never ever coming back again however desperately hungry iam. Also the service over there, especially if you are a desi is pretty bad, the guy at the door looks down carelessly and looks like he couldn't give a damn. That is the same attitude even if you go in without a takeout. And on top of it, they expect and stand there for a tip while paying them like hawks. The most unprofessional ever."}
{"text":"4 star food, 3 star service.  We ordered the goat karahi and chicken achari. both of the flavors are very good. We wanna try more next time. I am asking for a fork but the staff never give it to me. probably it is busy and he forgets. wish the service could be improved."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant and as always the quality of the food is great. It's my parents first time trying Indian food and they absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"This is super authentic Punjabi food! All of the Karahi's and curries are super good! Only drawback is that the service s really poor. Overall best indian food in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I love love love!! the food here. I tried the Chicken Haramasala today and it was absolutely amazing. Too bad its a special item and not a part of the regular menu. Now having said that, I wish they'd clean their restroom more often. How about cleaning the floors now and then, some air freshener maybe and oh, empty the trash once in a while?! I had to take back one star, just because of the restroom. Sorry CC :("}
{"text":"Saw them on Diners, Drive in's and Dives, who puts eggs in naan? That's not vegetarian, And the crowd looked like no Indians come here , nothing looked authentic!"}
{"text":"I would want to give 2.5 stars but rounding off to 3. We ordered a delivery from Amazon restaurants. This place had lots of reviews, hence wanted to give it a try.   We ordered Tandoori chicken, chicken keema and chicken korma. Both the curries came with rice. The Tandoori chicken to my surprise was really good, the meat was tender and juicy, really enjoyed the chicken. The keema was a disaster, there was absolutely no taste, it was bland and regretted it for ordering. The korma was alright for our taste and was better than keema.   I would want to give them a chance and try other dishes considering the scarcity of good Indian restaurants in the valley. The price is pretty decent for the quantity."}
{"text":"Okay food. Horrible service!! Hey guys it's not rocket science, smile a little, be kind to your customers."}
{"text":"The Tikka Masala is addicting and the cheese naan was good and fresh - gonna try the garlic naan next time. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Glad to return to this amazing secret after a four year absence.  The prices are great, the service attentive, and the food delicious.  My family,  friends, & I each ordered something different so we could taste the spectrum of food types and seasonings.  We were NOT disappointed!  Thanks Curry Corner ... see you next time!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant as I was a regular customer... but when I went for dinner two weeks ago... the waiter Shawn was extremely rude to us. He did not rEfill our water and bring our complete order of naan to the table. I ordered - total of 6 naans, which he brought to my table two at a time. We were a family of 5 and could not enjoy our food because the naan kept getting finished. Resulting in Shawn getting very loud with us and threatening to call the cops on us. all we did is ask him if he could please bring our final two naans so we could finish dinner. Then he packed the two naans and told us he had it ready for us to take home . My 6 year old and 3 year old were in tears begging him not to call the cops. And what was the reason?! Because he was telling us he gave us SUPERIOR customer service. And when we nicely told him it would have been fine to bring our naans together at once he started getting loud. Also I'm Pakistani so beware if you go to this restaurant because they will not treat you like a customer. I wrote the curry corner owner on Facebook and they did not follow up with me as promised so, apparently they don't appreciate there   Regular customers. So Hilal grill is my place to go for authentic Pakistani food."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful!!!!! The food is always great no matter how many times you order it. The Chicken Mahkni (I think that is how it is spelled) is an amazingly creamy and flavorful dish, especially with the Briyani rice. Great Tikki Masala too. You absolutely cannot go wrong with the Potato Naan, my husband requests an order just to himself.  I have only ever ordered out so I have had little experience with the full on customer experience, but the friendliness of the waitresses is hit and miss, but I cannot vouch for the dinning in experience. However, I still feel with the effort this place puts into making great food, it still deserves a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Food is really good but waiters don't know what they are doing and it's impossible to order pick up. It becomes more of a hassle to eat there rather than just being able to enjoy it"}
{"text":"I will start by saying we drove almost an hour to go there. We saw a rerun episode of Diners, drive-ins and Dives and they were talking about the fabulous food at Curry Corner!  I cannot say how disappointed we are about the experience. The food was awful!  The plates are served institution style, aluminum plates with dividers. I am assuming for portion control.  We ordered two plates; The tikka masala was watered down and the riata looked like skim milk. It came with a small piece old lettuce and tomato, by far this is the worst Indian food I have ever had. The other plate was goat curry, it was a little better, at least it was not watered down, but it was hard and chewy.  Do not get fooled by the Food Network Hype, I am sure they prepared days in advance for the visit. This is not the case for the regular customers. The place was packed with mostly Anglo clients, I am sure they were there for same reason we went.  The service was not great either, too busy for 1 server. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The worst dinning experience I've ever had here in Tempe      For starters, the staff are extremely rude and won't even give you a menu until you beg for it. Their food is ok though. I have ordered food for pickup several times and every single time my order is missing a main dish. Tonight, I came to the restaurant to have dinner about 40 minutes before closing time and the waiters told us that they are closing and they only take to go orders and there were a bunch of Indian people who just arrived at the restaurant and they served their food on the tables. I don't recommending this place to anyone looking to have great food and great times."}
{"text":"This place has incredible food and really poor service. My fiance and I come here every 4-6 months or so because we have to wait long enough to forget how bad the service is. We went on Thursday and the server barely spoke to us--it took 10 minutes to get menus and we were never offered refills on our drinks. We had to explain when we paid for our meal everything we ordered because the server didn't accurately write anything down. They clearly do great business with their carry out service, and my thought is that they should do away with the eat-in restaurant all together and just focus on that. The food is always *almost* awesome enough to merit the treatment, but I think this last visit will be, in fact, our last visit."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have a variety of Indian food.Its worth going to this place."}
{"text":"Indo-pak cuisine all meat is halal a good place for Muslims to eat. Not my favorite desk restaurant bit is #2 in my book. Took my wife here after I proposed to her and she liked it. She is a bigger critic of the food since she is Pakistani but said it was good enoigh."}
{"text":"Generally when i go there at night its good but i visited there in afternoon and ordered a malai kofta. One of the worst experience till date, lots of food coloring and no taste. I suggest them to stop adding coloring in veg dishes."}
{"text":"The food was very good here! Super flavorful and very well seasoned. I will definitely return. I would recommend the tikka masala for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the staffs weren't that friendly. We ordered samosa for appetizer and he brought pakora to the table. Maybe they thought that  we didn't know, but FYI that we spent 3 months traveling in India so we know what is the different between pakora and samosa.   He didn't even bother to ask how was our food, sad that they don't value their customers."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy eating at curry corner until now. I was in the middle of eating and I pulled a long brown hair. This is so disgusting. I will definitely not be eating here again. I wasn't able to finish my meal, I? threw everything away, I had ordered the food through post mates so I wasn't able to talk to the manager at the moment. I would love for someone to reach out to me to see how to resolve this issue."}
{"text":"One of the better cheap, casual indian restaurants.  Only complaint is their service is very iffy.  Sometimes we have a waiter who has to ask several times what we ordered and they even forget items you've ordered.  If the service was better, I'd be here more often."}
{"text":"This was a tasty surprise.  We ate here on a Saturday afternoon. Tikki masala fries were delicious.  I ordered the paneer tikki masala and although the flavor was good, I was a little disappointed  that I only had about 7 cubes of paneer. They were out of aloo nan but the regular nan was very good too.  I don't get to Tempe that often, but will consider this spot the next time I go."}
{"text":"Watched Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and saw Currys Corner.  We just had to try it!! It definitely lived up to the expectations!  Food was amazing!!! Try the Tikka Masala Fries! Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Good price, good portions and good flavor. You know it can be wrong if a lot of indians go have dinner there. Go wild and order things you haven't tried (forget the names that ring a bell).  I can't remember the names of what we ordered, but it was really tasty. Now they have a larger place with more tables."}
{"text":"Most of the times the food is good. sometimes you get unlucky they give you old stock. Which is really bad for our health."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my fav restaurants in Tempe. The chicken tikka masala is excellent! We also enjoy the mixed sizzler and hummus. We've tried a couple of other dishes, but the aforementioned are the go to dishes. I hesitate to give 5 stars because of the service. It's slow and most of the time inattentive. You will have to keep getting your servers attention the whole time. If you can live with this, the food is worth the experience, just go into it without high expectations on service. If the owner is there, which seems to only be on the weekend, the wait staff miraculously will slightly improve."}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix on a road trip and I went here because it had a good review online. Great samosas! My server recommended the chicken special of the day and it was excellent. He even gave me free garlic naan!"}
{"text":"They serve decent food but the service is awful. The worst I've seen ever. I am not going there again. The waiters are too dumb to remember the order that we placed and this happened many times."}
{"text":"If I was going to review based on the food I would give it 5*, based on the service I'd give it a 1*.  We walked in an hour before closing and were told at least 5 times that they were closing.   Every one who came in was seated in one corner so it was loud and chaotic.  We had to ask for plates because they were in such a hurry to leave they couldn't be bothered actually waiting on the tables.   The food was really outstanding but I would only do take out if I were going to go there again."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of non-vegetarian food. But the vegetarian options aren't great. They use too much of color in the food! And the naan (bread) is always too hard."}
{"text":"Food is as good as ever, but we are docking another star because of the service this time. We came in a bit after dinnertime, and it turned out to be pretty full despite the late hour. We ordered a straightforward meal, but either the server or the kitchen got confused and didn't communicate. The waiter was nice and listened when we told him we didn't get our naan but it still took forever because everyone was confused. We don't know whose fault it was but when they finally figured it out they brought it to us as we were finishing so we had to wrap it up and take it home when we wanted to eat it WITH our meal. Even after all of that, they didn't pay attention and overcharged us and added an entire entrée that we didn't order into our check. So we had to walk back in and have them refund us and we had to pay again. Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end and didn't have the usually pleasant experience we were expecting."}
{"text":"I love the vegetable daal they serve. Simply awesome. I like the food. Just that service is less because of 2 or 3 staff. But they are good and cordial. Great for students as it has affordable price."}
{"text":"Awesome food loved it.......! Worth spending Chicken biryani was so good and spicy. The ambience and serving were good. If you are near Tempe definitely try it."}
{"text":"Hi I went to this place today for dinner.the lady welcomed very well.i ordered shami kabob (also known as seek kabob).it was so delicious.mango Lassi was simply superbbb.recommending to try."}
{"text":"Lives up to expectations. The chicken tikka is best I've had. Naan is amazing. Owner is so nice and always there. Atmosphere is a bit underwhelming but once you get your food you don't mind at all."}
{"text":"The first problem we had was upon entering the restaurant. All the seats are weirdly situated and there is no hostess or sign that says wait to be seated. All the tables and chairs were located either too close to a bathroom or too close to the kitchen since it is such a small place. The table configurations were also weird with one booth that had two tables. So imagine a normal booth and on each side there is one person and a table in between. Now imagine the same thing but with two tables in between making the distance between you and the other person twice as distant as before.  When I looked around the place it looked filthy and I did notice a fly that kept flying around, which is not something I want to see or deal with when I'm eating. The paint on the walls was brown which I can only imagine is there to hide the grime. I wonder when the last time was that the whole restaurant received a good cleaning. From the attitude of the waitress, I am doubt it has been recent. Additionally, the service station is visible and there was a tacky sign that said \"EMPLOYEES ONLY\" for the kitchen -- of course it is employee's only.  We had horrible service. Our waitress acted like she had somewhere better to be. She also ignored us when it came time to pay the check which we waited forever for. We tried to flag her down but she wouldn't look at us and literally walked out the front door -- doing who knows what -- only to return 15 minutes later!  I had the tandoori chicken. Overall the food was very bland; I wonder if there was salt and pepper used in the making of it. It all seemed pre-cooked. The sauce that it came with was okay. Parts of the rice seemed undercooked. It was like good rice mixed in with bad rice. The rice should be the same consistency throughout. When we got our coke it tasted like it had root beer in it. I wonder if that was because it literally had root beer in it or because the soda dispenser is not clean.   My clothes smell like curry which I could overlook had the place been good.  To the owner or manager who has been replying on all the bad reviews: don't bother doing that on this one. Just take ownership of the criticism and fix the problems. Stop trying to live off your old successes of being on a television show; there are obvious problems with reoccurring themes which you should clearly be able to see from the amount of times you've had to comment on bad reviews. You really need to call Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"Up until about 8 months ago I have never had Indian food, but since we have been here several times.  Everytime we come we try something new and Curry Corner always delivers.  It's a cozy little family owned restaurant near ASS and it can be a little loud at times but so is almost every restaurant in the area.  The staff  is always polite and on top of everything.  The food is always the star anytime you walk through the door."}
{"text":"Excited to visit because heard a lot of good things about the place.  Went with about 11 people and the owner and waiter seemed irritated by our group.  Service was way below standard food was okay, but because of service I will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Found this place late on a Sunday night and was surprised it was open till 11. It was actually pretty crowded, too. Spoke with the owner, I believe, he was very nice and made us feel right at home.  The menu is on the wall, above the kitchen. So, if you don't know what you want, and can't see the wall from where you're sitting, then you'll have to go look.  They didn't have actual menus, but we didn't find that to be any big deal.    I had the chicken tikka masala with rice & added a garlic naan. It was SO fresh & tasty. My husband had the mixed grill and really liked his as well. We will definitely be back.  FYI - they are waiting on their new sign so it's a little hard to see, but they're right next to Club Tattoo."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Had the tikki masala fries they were great. They have feta on them which i am not usually a fan of feta but on the fries with the sauce it was awesome. Had the tiki masala lamb entre and some somosas which were great. Bread was also well done. Service was a little slow but food was great. Good for kids no liquor license so you can bring your own booze. There is a liquor store in the same little strip mall."}
{"text":"I've tried indian and Pakistani food many times but this place it's gorgeous so dilish!!! Also it is Halal food, if you don't know what is halal mean just google it. Try the spicy makhani chicken with garlic nan, it's killing me . I recommend this place for every one. I know many people keep trying just masala but now you need to get something new like the makhani"}
{"text":"Loooove this place. The chicken tikka masala and chicken magni never disappoints. Their naan bread (normal, cheesy and garlic kind) is delicious! Service is good. Food is very well priced."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I finally came down here from Northern side of Phoenix! Totally worth the drive!  First off , the website says they close at 10:30 , however don't let t fool you! They actually stop taking call orders at 10:30pm and they close their dine in at 10pm   Appetizer  Tikka masala fries with some Queso fresco Cotija cheese! No but for real, this was the first time in my life that I felt I was in a Mexi-Indian restaurant with the spices and the cheese part to the fries order!!! 10/10  Next up some tandoori chicken , I believed it was . Omg! The chicken was like rotisserie chicken but much more tender and flavorful !! 10/10 stars! Last but no least,  Lamb curry with garlic naan ! A M A Z I N G!!!  If you're a fan of Birria (Mexican goat curry) this dish is totally relatable ! It was too good!  Our waitress Gina was great! Loved how they were very welcoming and always being attentive !  Definitely will come back!!  Gracias paisanos!! Me siento como en casa! :D"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVED Curry Corner. The servers were awesome and the food was amazing. We got:  Tiki Masala Fries - 11 out of 10 recommend Cheesy naan - warm, delicious, and perfectly cheesy beef hummus - yummy as well platter with different curries and meats - everything was very flavor and delicious"}
{"text":"I'd never had Pakistani food before Curry Corner and now I can't stop! First time I came my friends and I split dishes (I always recommend this when trying new places). We tried the Tikka Masala Fries, the Goat Karahi, and the chicken Punjabi Handi.   The punjabi handi was the star of the show. Its the perfect amount of tomato and spice and heat and creamy. You HAVE to get it. (It was also featured on DDD)  The price is great. My only complaint is the service. I've been quite a few times where i've felt like service was reeeeaaallly unnecessarally slow. But im not sure if it may just be a bit of a cultural difference because I know that in many places staff should be signaled rather than stop by. Either way, the food is bomb, the price is great, & the staff is always friendly. Prob my fav spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is awful! The chicken tikka masala is not flavored and it tastes like the sauce is Campbell's tomato soup. The tikka masala fries were soggy and luke warm at best. The service was lacking, and the place wasn't even busy! I would drive the .2 miles to The Dhaba and never look back! Best of Phoenix 2011, yeah right!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places to eat anywhere in the valley!  Try the Samosas, they are kind of addicting."}
{"text":"We know good Indo-Pak food (having grown up on Indo-Pak food gives us some credibility) and on our 1st visit, the whole group left raving!!  The Kharai Goat was finger licking good!  Seekh Kebabs were so flavorful!  The Afghani Boti was grilled to perfection.  The chicken tikka masala was ok.  And the mango lassi was so refreshing!!!  We will be back to Curry Corner for sure!! Worth the 30 min drive from So Chandler:)"}
{"text":"Went after seeing the place on triple D. The food was very good but the portions sucked. The chicken tika and korma were both boned when should be boneless. No buffet for lunch and prices were good. I will give it another try in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place. Unfortunately I'm not in Tempe as often as I used to be so don't get to eat here as often as I'd like. The tikka masala fries are awesome as is pretty much everything I've tried from here. Its very well priced compared to some other Indian places I've eaten. I'm giving it 4 stars because I do think there is some room for improvement. For the price its great but I have had better Indian food. Definitely recommend trying it sometime."}
{"text":"After watching an episode on triple D, my friend and I decided to try this location. So glad we did because we weren't disappointed! The garlic naan was delicious and so were the fries!! We also got tandoori chicken and and lamb tika masala. We ate every drop of food! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"So far we have been waiting for 20 minutes and when they brought out food it was my husbands and I am still waiting for mine. So I am sitting here watching him eat. Who does that?  We were asked twice our drink orders and when I was telling him my order he was tapping on the table. Are you serious??  So far they are not impressive"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed by this place. I eat Indian food at-least once every couple weeks. I decided to go here based on the show Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). Well let me say this place is high up on the dive end of scale and I will never go back.  I placed an order for take-out and ordered the Chicken Tikks Masala (my favorite), Matar Paneer, and Cheese Naan. I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables taken. That should have been my warning to leave, but no... I said I will give it a try based on Triple D.   I pay for my order and head back to my hotel. No issue with service, I only walked in and picked up my order. I get back and sit down ready to partake on what I am expecting to be some good/great Indian food. This is where the disappointment starts setting in... :-(  I open up the soup container of Chicken Tikka Masala, and I notice something isn't right.. The Masala sauce is very loose, almost like they used skim milk vs heavy cream. So I opened the container of rice to add to it and I took a bite... no seasoning. Just bland white rice. No flavor of cumin, clove or cardamom, not even salt. I taste Tikka Masala sauce and it wasn't good, almost seemed like they left some important spices out.  I then proceeded to open the soup container of Matar Paneer. This was loose as well. I am really getting frustrated now. I take a spoon and search for the peas and a chunk of the Paneer (homemade cheese). Instead of Paneer, it tasted and had the mouth feel of tofu. Very disappointed. I closed up the containers of Chicken Tiki Masala, Matar Paneer, and rice and threw them straight into the trash.   The only thing that was good was the cheese naan.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, in fact in my opinion, it is a disgrace to Indian Food.   I have ate at one other Indian restaurant; Indian Place (Indian Delhi Palace - http://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-delhi-palace-phoenix?hrid=vLH0tzET4aC02gSgEAWkMw) in the Phoenix area, and I should have just went back there."}
{"text":"So good! I'm a vegetarian; got the veggie thali plate. Delicious, super-spicy garbanzos and dal, not so great spinach. Excellent value. Mango lassi tasted sweet, not mango-y. Split excellent aloo tiki appetizer. Husband said his chicken thali plate was also great. Wish they'd open one in our part of the country!!"}
{"text":"We had ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and the Goat Karahi. The sauces and seasoning was amazing. It was also nice to be able to have unsweetened raspberry iced tea as opposed to its sweetened counterpart. My only issue which is minimal at best was it was difficult to eat some of the goat chops because there were a lot of small pieces of bone stuck to the meat I was trying to consume. Other than that, pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the food here went for the first time about a month ago and went back again about 2 weeks ago. They have pretty good prices, clean and friendly staff. If you have never been before and are not sure what to order I found that there online menu has pictures which is really helpful. I wanted to get what I got the first time but I didnt remember the name and was not very good at explaining what it was so I ended up with something different, but it was very good too."}
{"text":"I went back here to try again after my disappointing first attempt. This time I was very pleased. The food was excellent and the portions on the lunch combo were perfect. I'm really glad I tried again, this place will  become a regular for me!"}
{"text":"Found this place on here about 6 mo ago and have gone twice, really enjoyed it both times.  Service has been very good both times, drinks stayed full (it is semi-self serve, so ymmv), and food came out piping hot.    The food:  The girlfriend and I like to get samplers so we can try a wide range of food, both times we got 1 non-veg, and 1 veg combo.  I highly recommend that to a) people looking for variety and b) people looking for leftovers.    The first time we went we saw these incredible looking fries come out so it was a must order the 2nd time through.  The Tikka Misala fries were very good.  I feel like the menu said feta but we got blue cheese.  It was still very delicious.  The only thing I would enjoy more would be more naan to come with it,  I know I could order more but I am too busy enjoying the deliciousness.    Have been looking for a reliable option for this kind of food nearby and I think I've found it.  Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant has been on TV and is quite famous, but not anymore. The quality since the TV show has drastically reduced. The service is below par. The decor looks stale and dirty as though there is no life. However I got to say that the food is better than any Indian restaurant that I have tried so far. Really good spices in every dish. The flavors are strong and balanced. The quantity is on the higher side so order accordingly. All said, it's better to take Todo order and enjoy the awesome food at home."}
{"text":"After giving this restaurant numerous chances to redeem itself, I finally give up. The portions are super small compared to other South Asian restaurants, it's over priced, and has really inconsistent food. Last time we went our naan was burnt and Chicken Hara Masala tasted bitter. I was super disappointed. Another time I went I was waiting at the counter for 5 minutes because the cashier was too busy on his phone and was completely ignoring me. I really don't get why it's always so busy in there. There are way better restaurants near by. Only reason I used to go was because it's the only halal place near by. Will definitely not go ever again.  P.S. if you are in the area go to Moroccan Paradise right next to Curry Corner. AMAZING and halal"}
{"text":"I visited this place last night with a mate after otherwise unsuccessfully attempting to eat other places. I am glad, considering this place is great.  We shared a vegetarian thali and samosas. It came with yogurt, gobi aloo, masoor dal, palak paneer, chana masala, onion, rice in the centre, and naan on the side. We asked for extra naan. Their naan was quite fluffy and thick compared to other places that I have eaten from, or especially when compared to grocery market purchased naan. All of it was very flavourful. I was really impressed with the spices on the chick peas, especially. Their palak paneer was a very smooth combination of the paneer and spinach flavours. The gobi aloo's identity eluded me at first because i had trouble figuring out that the cauliflower on top was upside down. The spices did not overpower the buttery nature of the cauliflower and were well accented with potato. Neither of us are onion fans, and both of us prefer our yoghurt sweet, so we took no liking to those small sides, although they were obviously less important than the curries. The masoor dal had an appealing milkiness to it. Their samosas were extremely good, with no lack in filling. There was nothing above mild spiciness on our plate, which was of no consequence to either of us as everything was hugely savory.  As far as the eating environment inside, the place is quite small and it seems to be in an otherwise relatively suspicious lot. I found it cozy. They do not wait on you. The menu is right above the order window. They do bring out your food to you, so there is no need to pick it up. They will do take out. The staff are all very friendly. You serve yourself water from a small stand with cups and pitchers. The minimal decorations are pretty and not overbearing, although most of Curry Corner's atmosphere seems to come from its customers keeping the place busy.  I ordered mango lassi on the way out. It is thicker than most I have had and instead of being blended with ice, it has ice cubes in it to chill it, but it was still delicious. It also lasted overnight in the fridge and still tasted good the next day."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but every time the services is slow even with an empty restaurant. The past few times they have messed up our orders. If you can put up with the service and waiting then the Lamb tikka masala is really good."}
{"text":"Curry Corner 1212 Apache Blvd Tempe, AZ 85281  I heard about Curry Corner from a friend who said that they heard about it on Food Network and that it was supposed to be fabulous.  I arrived there at 11:00, only to be told that they don't open till 11:30. No problem to wait and observe that they are currently under construction as they expand to two more stores next door.  Promptly at 11:30 the door opened and I was invited in. The current location is on the smaller side and being under construction is not what I would exactly consider to be highly inviting, however, taking this into consideration, I evaluated only on the food and service.  First on my order list was garlic naan. It came to the table still hot, bubbly and flakey on the edges and chewy in the middle. It was fragrant with the aroma of garlic.  Next, came a bowl of karahi. A dish composed of goat, slow cooked in ginger and spices, onions, yogurt and tomatoes. I love spicy food, and asked for it to be made that way, and the cook happily complied. The dish was excellent and filled with lots of meat that was beautifully tender. I was given a choice of it being served with rice or with naan, and as I had already ordered naan I opted for the rice which was perfectly cooked.  Service was reasonable and the tables were clean.  I am looking forward to coming back after the construction is finished and trying a much larger selection of dishes.  For the time being, I will give them 4 stars for the excellent food."}
{"text":"The food quality is good, but not like the old days when I used to come a lot. The amount of food is decreasing especially for the rice. The new waiters need to not forget the customer's order. Overall, it's still good."}
{"text":"I will give Curry Corner as five stars out five stars. The food is always good whatever I tried any of them, one of the reason is maybe I'm the Indian food lover. Although there are some of disadvantages like unclean restroom, the slow calling for waters, Curry Corner is definitely the good place to go if you like Indian food or spice food. The final suggestion, if you don't know what to order, the Chicken Tikka Masala always a good choice."}
{"text":"People have to stop judging Indian restaurants by how they make Chicken Tikka Masala or any Tikka Masala for that matter. Yes, Chicken Tikka Masala is an Indian dish but it is not the only Indian dish. Hell, it's a north Indian dish that seldom gets any attention in other parts of India.  I choose Curry Corner over other Indian restaurants in this area because of its positive reviews. I ordered a Lamb Biryani and a Chicken Curry to-go was told the order would take 15-20mins. So I sat at one of the tables and patiently waited. The place was not busy and almost everyone who came after me got their food served while I was still kept waiting. Finally, after more than 35mins of waiting my order was ready and I was told the Lamb Biryani usually takes time to prepare. So I thought maybe Biryani was worth the wait.  Initially the Biryani looked good but when I started digging into it was when I realized how badly it was prepared. The Biryani was just rice mixed with some curry and a few hard-to-chew lamb pieces thrown in. Trust me, it tasted awful. I simply don't understand why some Indian restaurants have this compulsion to include a Biryani on the menu when they don't know or even have the faintest idea about how it is prepared.  And as for the Chicken Curry, it tasted OK; nothing great - just mediocre.  Curry Corner is another Indian restaurant serving mediocre Indian food to susceptible locals. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala w/ rice and garlic naan.  All of it was very good.  Nice spice to the sauce.  It was very filling but I wanted rice AND naan so ordered it extra.  I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is obviously understaffed. When I walked in, out of 10 tables, one had food. Tried to order to go, another couple behind me walks in behind me, and they get served first. Made contact with the one waiter working his tail off. Menus were fraying and caked with grease. I gave up and walked out. It's a workday, I don't have the luxury to wait on a poorly run restaurant."}
{"text":"We made a special stop here before leaving Phoenix after seeing them on triple D.   They had large portions at a good price. The food was delicious.  The reason this is not a 5 is that my husband's goat karahi dish had many many bones in it. (We counted over a dozen). He actually cut the inside of his mouth on one and was bleeding. These were not large bones that would be easily eaten around. They were small, somewhat chopped pieces of bones that were dangerous to be served. They could have easily been swallowed.  We would actually return, as we are hoping this was an anomaly."}
{"text":"I have been to curry corner before but i was waiting to try their Tandoori chicken Tikka (which was featured on food network) before giving them a review. We walked in today for a late lunch,the place was almost full and people kept coming in,they also had a large number of pick up orders.  We settled on a cozy booth and ordered ~Tandoori chicken tikka (marinated Thigh and leg of chicken,charcoal grilled) $8 ~Chicken reshmi kebab (chicken marinated in garlic and ginger paste,cooked in tandoor) $8 ~Non vegetarian Thali (rice,naan,dal,two types of chicken curry) $8.75 ~Lassi (salted yogurt) $2.25 ~Soda $2  The thalis are not available for take-out. All tandoori items are served with Rice or naan,mint chutney and pickled onions. They also serve Sindhi biryani here which is a little different from what you would typically get at an Indian restaurant (Hyderabadi/Andhra style).The biryani is nice,flavorful and has a subtle hint of whole spices.I am not a fan of the salted lassi (i was expecting it to be buttermilk). The tandoori chicken is definitely better than a lot of other restaurants it's moist and tender but lacks flavor. The service is a little slow and it took the food a good 20 minutes to get to our table.  Overall i would give curry corner 5 stars for affordability but 3.5 stars for taste.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm been to the Curry Corner in the past and loved their naan bread. I made a curry dish and went there to get some naan to go with my meal. I also got an order of hoomus which came with naan. I paid and included a tip, but when I got home I found out I only had one piece of naan and a small bowl of hoomus. There was barely enough bread for the small hoomus and not enough for the meal. There are a lot of Indian restaurants in town that don't cheat people, I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband couldn't stop raving about this place after we dined here. Indian food is one of his favorite cuisines so that should tell you how good it was here. It was really busy on a Friday night at 8 PM. It took a little time to be seated, but you can tell everyone was working very hard.  Food: 1) Tikki Masala Fries - so good! It's a great twist on a classic American side dish. I wasn't hungry, but I couldn't stop picking at it! The topping was addictive! 2) Chicken Makhani - recommended by the owner. It was creamy with a kick and they gave a lot of chicken for $8. The naan was light, crispy yet fluffy, and not overly oiled. It went perfectly with the makhani."}
{"text":"Definitely thought I had reviewed this place before. But I guess not...  I had tried their catering before, and it was pretty good. So I decided I would try their restaurant food.  Bad idea. I ordered chicken tikka masala and got chicken tikka soup. The masala that was there was super watered down, and the chicken was a mix of white meat and brown meat, some of the brown meat was so tough that I had to leave a few pieces of the chicken uneaten. The naan was really good, but the chicken tikka masala was very sub par. To make matters worse, it cost a whopping $7. When $7 gets you much more food at other places, I doubt you are going to venture back here. I suppose it was worth a try, but its not worth the return."}
{"text":"Curry Corner is definitely NOT curry in a hurry! We entered the restaurant and were told to sit wherever we wanted. So, we took a cozy little corner booth since we were at a Curry Corner. It took some time for a server to come by, and we ordered a wrap and the vegetable thali. After another stretch of time the server came by again saying they didn't have the wraps available today. So, the chicken keema ended up being the alternative choice.   It took a loooong time for our meals to get served to us, but they did look delectable. My vegetable thali plate had lentil/dal, spinach/palak, vegetable handi, chikpeas/chole, with a generous heap of rice and a piece of freshly baked naan. I enjoyed all the dishes on my plate and the naan was a good balance of crisp outer layer with soft inner portion. The rice was well cooked, nice and fluffy. I also had a bite of the chicken keema which seemed a bit bland to me.   I had asked for a soda but since service was nearly non-existent and I was doubting I would even get any refills if I had gotten my drink we asked them to take it off our bill once we went up to the register to pay.   Since it took so long, I probably won't be back. I did enjoy the food but there are other Indian restaurants in Tempe with better service with equally tasty dishes!"}
{"text":"I admit that I was drawn to this place because I saw it on Diners, Drive thrus, and dives several months ago. I added it to my list, but had yet to visit. Recently I had a weekday off work and decided that was the day to go. They open at 11 and I arrived about a quarter past. The parking lot was empty at that time and I was unsure they were open. I went inside and I was the first customer of the day. The lady in the dining room was very nice and asked about drinks right away. The menu had a lot of good looking items, but I wanted to try something different. I asked about the nehari noor jehan, which was a dish from Pakistani. I didn't know how to pronounce it so I just pointed and said that one. She said it was very good. It arrived fairly quickly and came in a large dish with the marinated boneless beef and another plate with rice. She brought a third plate for me to combine the two. A lot of dishes for one person, but I wasn't washing them so I didn't mind. The plate was excellent. Great flavor, the beef was very tender, and the sauce was great. It was also a very large portion. If my wife would have been there we could have easily shared. As it was I left full and had almost a full box to take home. As I was there the place began to fill up as it moved closer to noon. I would definitely go back and try something else or even stick with that dish again."}
{"text":"Curry Corner is one of my favorite all time places to eat! Their Chicken Tikka Masala is the only thing I ever order. The garlic naan bread pairs very well. I am sad I no longer live in the valley to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"After leaving the last review, the owner contacted me apologized and invited us to visit again. We have not go yet, but I will give a 5 start for their positive attitude  :-P I respect business owners that take their customer seriously."}
{"text":"The food, amazing, try the garlic Naan and if you are a meat eater the Tandori Grill sampler is amazing but I also love the curries as the sauce is amazing with the Naan and the price, extremely affordable - generally about $10 a person and you will leave full. I was actually recommended to try this out well before it was showcased on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It is a culinary jewel right off of the light rail line."}
{"text":"Sure, the fishtank looks gross and the decor is far more shabby than chic, but nobody comes here for the ambiance. The FOOD, man, the food is incredible. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. The cheese naan is so wrong but SO RIGHT. The chicken tikka masala is on point, and the goat biryani is so tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Cheapest place I've ever been to. Tap water for drinking , no soap in the restrooms (they use dish detergent with water added to it). Even the rice has tap water aftertaste. So disgusted. Won't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My main reason for coming here was the tikka masala fries - it sounded too good to pass up.  And like Russell Peters' standup comedy, these fries are TOOOOO GOOD.  Pictures do not do the tikka masala fries any form of justice because no camera in existence is capable of capturing the full spectrum of their awesomeness.  For only a few bucks you get a generous portion of delicious french fries SMOTHERED in tikka masala sauce, drizzled with some white yogurty sauce, and then topped with feta cheese.  OH MAN.  It was so good that I would be very inclined to make the 400 mile drive from LA just to eat those fries again.  I couldn't finish them on my own so I took half home, even though I was worried that they'd be soggy the next day.  But turns out, they were STILL GOOD as leftovers.  I swear, that tikka masala must be magical as both a goldmine of flavor and as a preserver of all that is goodness.  I also highly recommend the goat karahi.  So much spices and deliciousness in one dish, I definitely got the curry sweats afterward but it was SO worth it.  I can't even imagine how much spicier some of their dishes must be, considering the karahi wasn't even marked on the menu and yet it was able to sizzle my mouth adequately.  Didn't learn until a month later that the joint was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, & Dive's.  No wonder the TV was only tuned to the Food Network!  Definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.  Hopefully Guy Fieri isn't there, since I can't really stand his face."}
{"text":"My favorite Pakistani place in the area hands down. As seen on the food network and even better than you'd imagine. Family owned business and authentic cuisine. I love the kabob platter here and really everything else."}
{"text":"This place is delicious...the service was great, well worth the wait, I had the Arabic plate, so much flavor definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"If you're not Indian, expect bad service. 75+ yr old white haired Caucasian who asked for take out menu literally given only menus in Indian.  Lots of tiny bones in the goat Briyani. Very tasty but goat pieces small and had small bones = hard to eat.  'extra spicy' sadly is not."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after searching for a good Indian place near me. There's quite a few options in Tempe, but since this place had good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Service was good and the prices were very good. I couldn't decide on what to get but the waitress suggested I try the Arabic Plate. It's not on the menu and has a few items on it. For $11 dollars its a lot of food. I opted for Garlic Naan with my dish. The Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala were delicious. The Hummus was good and the rice was tasty. The Garlic Naan was fresh and warm.   The service was good and the food was tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable. Very close to campus. Food is mediocre, lacks flavor and spice. Will not come back again"}
{"text":"I love and hate Curry Corner.  Curry Corner has excellent food. I mean seriously great middle eastern and Indian food. The things I need however out of a place like Curry Corner are simple and not always met--quick service, good food, and most importantly a good take-out experience.  \"Take-out experience? What the hell is that, Faraaz?\"  It's several things for me, including the amount of food given when taking out versus when eating in. It's also the quality of the take out box material and strength of the plastic bag they go in. Also, if I choose to not throw away my half eaten meal for a week, take out experience includes the smell of old leftovers (refrigerated and left on the counter).  So yeah, I love and hate Curry Corner because the take out experience just isn't up to par. They seriously will give you almost half the amount of food on many dishes. Plus, it takes forever (which is okay because the food at least tastes really, really good). Everyone is all about the Tikka Masala, but they have many other great items that get overlooked. Branch out, order something you can't pronounce, and prepare to have a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Recently they have been making far too many order mistakes (how hard is it to remember I want naan instead of rice?) and the service has been just awful. My boyfriend and I just left there without even eating. The guy who greeted us told us a moment to clean a booth when there were two other clean booths available, then went to \"clean\" it. He did absolutely nothing to the table, it was filthy. Then he came back and instead of walking us to the table, handed my boyfriend the menus and told us we could go. Ok. Fine.   We ordered a diet soda, water and a mango lassi. Took 10 minutes to get water and soda. We waited another 10 minutes and we never saw the waiter/greeter/whatever he was again. Got up and left. On our way now to another Indian place that hopefully has good service and gets out the right order."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service always sucks. The waiter who is Caucasian likes to ignore white people when they come in. He talks to you like you are stupid. I woldn't mention it if it didnt happen every time we come here. Its the 8th or 9th time it happened.  They really need to be more attentive to their customers."}
{"text":"When I came here for the first time I thought I've found my place for authentic Pakistani food. But as I became a regular and tried different dishes I realized how wrong I was. They have renovated the place but have got downhill regarding the food. Even the restaurant area is not so clean and there's always food and stuff under the tables where the customers are supposed to have their meals. Disgusting. I can not even mention one food item that impressed me. Chicken tikka had a lot of color which even colored my fingers, nihari was tooooo salty, biryani was bland, chappli kabab was burnt and parathas didn't seem like parathas. Even the server never comes back to check on us once after taking the order. Plz management pay some attention to your quality of food n customer service. Otherwise u will b losing customers like me."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was not. Not once did our order taker/server ask if we needed anything, and once I asked for a togo box.  I got a small container that I guess I was supped to put my rice, chicken, humus, and naan into. I had to ask for additional containers, as if. I feel as  though I cheated my for leaving a tip.... If u can, I suggest ordering to go !"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. I wish I knew more about Indian food or culture to really enjoy it. But I don't, whatever.   Their naan is AMAZING. It's so flaky and buttery! My favorite of course. Their chicken tikki masala is on point. It has lots of flavor and is the perfect amount of spicy. So was their tandoor chicken tikki masala.   Their rice lacked flavor but it wasn't too bad with the other stuff.   I got this stew thing, which was pretty good but I'm not a big fan of lamb so if I had to get it again, I'd get beef instead.   We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"We were here on a business trip saw this restaurant on DDD thought let's try it !!! Got take out one night got a veg curry Palak panner and naan ,Palak panner tasted like boiled Palak with salt and red chills in it with old panner .  But we thought hey maybe there non veg would be better  We went to dine in the next night ordered a few different dishes also told the waiter that did not like the food last night he was like don't worry i here Food was ok I guess for the price  But spent the night vomiting I guess that's what you get!!!! This restaurant makes Indian food look bad, and Indian people with the way give customer service...  Sorry to say they even make DDD look bad  Will NEVER EVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"I have made the trek to curry corner a few times from Glendale because it's worth the drive! I love the food, the best Indo-Pak restaurant in phx! I have never been disappointed by this place. I have tried multiple dishes and I'll try to keep it brief!   The chicken tikka fries were delicious and something new, worth trying! The samosas taste freshly prepared with what seems like homemade pastry. By far one of the best chicken tikka masalas I've ever had, a must try!!!!! I've also tried the lamb karahi which was delicious, the lamb was not tough, but this dish does take extra time so don't order if you're in a hurry! The afghani boti had so much delicious spicy flavor with lots of cilantro, the meat was so tender and juicy! The malai kofta was delicious not as heavy as I'm used to with a little more spice than normal, which was a nice change. The aloo mataar was a great vegetarian dish high on flavor! Of all the dishes I've tried there was only one I wouldn't order again, the nehari noor jehan. The meat was too fatty and there wasn't much; I think I had 4-5 pieces. Overall, I love this place and wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"Beef biriyani didn't taste that good. I didn't get a chance to try other biriyanis but the appetizers are great."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here.  The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11.   One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.  I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day."}
{"text":"The shittiest food ever The biiriyani yuck Ghe butter chicke. Wtf was that water no gravy  Samosas they took 20 mins n they got us samosa which was not warm from inside Neverrrr go there"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  BUT;  it was very hot in restaurant, until it was packed then they turned the A/C down to make it comfortable.  The service was terrible,  couldn't get even ice water, and we were shorted an order of rice."}
{"text":"Lazy scumbags don't answer their phone. Really frustrating when you just landed and was trying to place a takeout order. Gave up after several calls well over 30 minutes prior to their published closing time."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at 6pm just alone , got seated quickly and staff were very friendly ( surprised at some reviews saying otherwise?)   Started with Chicken Pakora, this was the only let down of the meal. Some of the chicken especially small pieces were so overlooked and tough it wasn't enjoyable   Main Lamb Kahari , rice and plain Nan Bread. This was special, nice spice to it but not overwhelming, tasted so fresh and the lamb was cooked perfectly . Nan was also baked to perfection , just a bit crispy . A bit too much rice in relation to the main dish though ( not a complaint, just a preference)  Plan on going again   Dropped 1 star for the Pakora, everything else was class"}
{"text":"I had a late lunch here yesterday (around 2:30pm) and my experience was not very pleasant with food and to a certain extent, service.    I ordered the 'Afghan Boti' reluctantly and because I was hungry and have spent 5 years in Afghanistan previously for work. Very familiar with Afghan food even though I had never heard of Afghan Boti before but ordered it under the assumption that it must be close to or similar to Afghan 'Dopiaza' based on the description in the menu.  The description could be misleading especially for folks who are familiar with Afghan cuisine.  Basically, it states \"...white meat...\" without specifying whether it's chicken or beef.  However, Afghan Dopiaza is beef chunks/cubes (with and without bone) that is slowly cooked and the beef comes out sort of whiteish...a common dish.  This was certainly not the case, they served me with pieces of chicken breast that was mostly RAW!!! I even showed it to the waiter half way through my meal, he was nice enough to offer to replace it but at that point I had lost my appetite.  Additionally, I think the cook just went postal with SALT! Oh my God, just WAY TOO salty just unbelievably salty!   I also ordered the Lassi (yogurt drink) and it was so thick that it made it almost impossible to drink through a straw.  So, I asked the waiter to dump half of it and put water in it so it can be real Lassi which is supposed to be thin!   I am sure other dishes are probably good but I don't believe that I will EVER order Lassi and the so-called Afghan Boti again.  Besides, can't expect an Indian restaurant to produce authentic Afghan dish."}
{"text":"Was at an event with a bunch of friends and decided to come here last minute. Tiki masala chicken was good and the garlic naan was ok. Mango Lassie was also good.  Place is smaller so we had to wait a while for table but we were so hungry we got it to go.  Pretty satisfied with this choice instead of a burger."}
{"text":"The food was good, the main problem was the service. The food was dropped off and that was it. At first I thought this might be a place I will come back to but after today we will not come back also make sure they don't over charge you as all the menu prices are different.  Also asked for a drink refill and it never came till we reminded them the third time."}
{"text":"Been here 5 times so far.   The curries is always tasty and  consistent,   Price is cheap, and the portions is huge."}
{"text":"They've got great tasting dishes. My favorite dish is the chicken tikka Masala, it's to die for. It's also priced very good and won't put a dent in your wallet. They don't have buffet but that doesn't bother me cuz they always serve fresh tasting food. This is my go to place whenever I'm in the mood for Indian food. Overall, I would recommend this place to any person who wants to try some authentic Indian delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices.  - The tandoori mixed grill was very good.  It's been a long time since I've had tandoori that was this tender with that tangy flavor that permeated deep into the meat.   - The chicken tikka masala was a little thin, but the chicken was tender and the sauce had a couple layers of flavor to it.  Smooth followed by a touch of heat.    - The chicken jalfrezi was a little too creamy, but the hot peppers and the green peppers gave it a nice flavor  - Although not really an IndoPak dish, the chicken hummus was really good as well.  Different than most hummus I've had in a good way.  More tangy and savory"}
{"text":"Very nice hole in the wall centered in a strip of shops east of the campus. The servers were attentive and professional. I ordered the goat karahi with garlic nan and an ice tea. The goat was great. I like eating goat when it is offered in a place like this and it didn't disappoint. I took it as it came, and it had a nice flavorful spice to it but not overly hot. You need to pick up the bones and chew and suck out the remaining little bits of meat and juice. If this bothers you, don't get it. The nan was good too. A  good meal for 1 hungry person or very light for 2. The rest of the menu looked very good and people seed to be enjoying their meals. A medium sized crowd but it was early. The only thing that could have been better was the iced tea. Not bad, not great. I would definitely come back . The whole meal was $12 and change."}
{"text":"If you have just a bit of patience you will get really good food. My boyfriend had Indian food for the first time here and was not disappointed, despite him not liking spicy things particularly (the servers took note and suggested things with help from my Indian roommates).   I ordered the hummus which came with 2 pitas and the palak panneer, which was amazing and delicious. We all ended up not being able to finish our meals so we got doggy bags that sealed shut and a plastic bag.   It was also cool to see the Diners Drive ins and Dines spray paint stencil on the wall."}
{"text":"Curry Corner used to be one of my favorite Indian places, especially since it's close to ASU. However, the last time that I went, I felt so bad for the waitress. When we were checking out, she said how hungry she was because she isn't allowed a break (which I let her know was illegal, but I guess she needed a job). When we were going to leave a tip, she also let us know that the owner keeps ALL the tips and told us we didn't need to leave her a tip since she wouldn't see it anyway (we even tried to give her cash and she didn't take it).   I REFUSE to eat at Curry Corner until they treat their employees better!!! This is so wrong & I now understand other people's comments on the poor service they receive. If I was working there and was illegally denied a break and my tips were taken from me, I would have no motivation to provide quality service either (although this girl was great)."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good tasty biryani in the valley for quite some time now and this was the closest I could get ! The biryani is mildly flavored and the chicken was tender and spiced perfectly . The samosas here are the best  . Cozy little place with some good Bollywood music and yummy food !"}
{"text":"Food was Ok.  Service was Ok. Our food came out at different times. Two dishes and naan... Then 10 min later the rice. Then five min later the other two dishes. The cheese cubes inside the paneer tikki masala was good, but the sauce initially tasted like speghetti sauce. The sauce looked different than the chicken tiki masala, which was spicier but tasty. The palak murg was devoid of any flavor but spiciness. Just mashed spinach in oil."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Curry Corner this evening for our 18th anniversary. We chose Curry Corner based on a recommendation from a coworker who happens to be Pakistani. We live on the other side of the valley but often frequent restaurants on the East side. I have to say that Curry Corner was worth the drive.  The food and service at this restaurant was top notch. I ordered the vegetarian thali plate which was a combination of a few vegetable curries along with lentils (daal), basmati rice, yogurt and naan (bread). The curries were very flavorful and cooked well. The heat level was not too high but the waiter said they could be spiced to your liking. Next time! My wife ordered the shrimp tikka masala. Being a vegetarian I did not sample the dish entirely but I do admit I did taste the sauce. The masala sauce was flavorful, rich and not very spicy. I forgot to mention that we started the meal with samosas and a hummus plate. Hummus is not something I usually see at an Indian restaurant, but it was fantastic! It was served with their awesome naan. I have to say that the prices of this place were extremely reasonable. I really cannot wait until we can go back to Curry Corner. If you like Indian or Pakistani food, hurry up and head over to Curry Corner."}
{"text":"Food is good. But terrible service. Ordered on the phone but when showed up at the restaurant had to wait for a long time to pick up the food. They might tell you on the phone that it will take only 20 mins but when you show up 20 mins later, the food will most likely not be ready. And the sad thing is they don't even care that you are waiting."}
{"text":"I loved the tikka fries! They were amazing! Never tried any fries like it!  The chicken and goat karahi were good but honestly I cannot call it karahi. More like any old curry. It really wasn't the traditional karahi taste I was expecting from Pakistan. The look of it was not like karahi too. More like a korma in my humble opinion.  Still it was yummy. And if I didn't know what karahi was then I would think it was amazing loll. Yummy curry, but can't call it karahi ;-) I liked the goat karahi better than the chicken karahi.   The naan is always great :-)  Overall I love this place. Definitely happy to have them in AZ."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cramped spaces, just like India itself!"}
{"text":"I originally saw this on Diner's Drive-Ins, and Dives and decided to put it on the list of restaurants to try in Phoenix. I have to say before that show has pointed me in the wrong direction, but I decided to try a variety of food I have never tasted before. I am soo glad that I did, this place was amazing, so much so that I literally told everyone about it and was there within a couple of days.  The third time was a little disappointing, we were forgotten a few times, and I totally get not having good days while waiting at tables. I've waited tables a majority of my life and some people on Yelp could really chill for a second and walk in a waitresses shoes; Just Sayin. Any how it was dead but they had been unexpectedly busy all day so I'm sure they were just beat. Any way I'd totally go back again, wish they had a location in Phoenix, if they did I'd support them more. Sadly the drive is way long for consistent visiting."}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona and have been craving Indian food for months, but have had a hard time finding a place. I saw online that Guy Fieri(sp?) had been here so I decided to go. This place satisfied my cravings and left me stuffed. I had the veggie pakora which could have been a little more fresh and the tikka masala which was delicious. The waiter was really nice and talked with me for a while. I'll be back to try their fries!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great discovery... My friends and I came all the way from Glendale because we had heard a few decent reviews... But man.. I am more than impressed... we ordered our entree's.. and ordered more because it was amazingggg. we even had dessert and chai.. let me just say.. \"epic chai\" and \"epic kheer\" - their kheer and halwa (desserts) are amazing.... everything tastes great, very authentic and pakistani... and ridiculously cheap.. great deal for students or non students...   you will see when you get there how full it is... the busy restaurant is a testament of a great place... its definitely worth the drive. thank you for finally having a great Pakistani style restaurant... took me forever to find u guys! Love it. Cant wait to come back..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both the times my experience has been decent. We tried their Mediterranean thali. Which is essentially called Mediterranean because they serve hummus with it. The chicken curries are decent. Not too bad but not great either. Food-Their thalis are decent. I dislike the use of food color though. They certainly serve some of the better indian food in town. Service- I believe they could really improve in terms of service. Sometimes the guy serving here comes off as straight off rude. Some of my friends have also faced similar situations with their staff.  Strictly food-wise it would be a 3.5/5 but service stands at 2/5 for me."}
{"text":"This place gets you seated and served super quick and the food is amazing! I always get the tandoori chicken, chicken tiki masala or the curry.  Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Curry is excellent, but they have recently replaced their old plastic containers with much smaller styrofoam cups. Same price, 40% less food. Beware if you order to go."}
{"text":"Down to earth place with friendly staff. Good portions too. Best chicken wings I've ever had. Nihari was ok. Tikka masala fries sounds better than it tastes. Overall good experience. They make u feel welcome and that matters. Will go again."}
{"text":"GUY FIERI! OMG HE CAME TO THIS PLACE TO EAT!  And that man sure don't disappoint, probably the best indian food I've ever ate! We started off with the tikka masala fries as appetizer. It was like chili fries but with an indian twist. I thought it was very interesting and was certainly delicious.  Later on I got the chicken curry while my babe got the chicken makhani. They were both delicious, but the best part was the fresh-baked naan that came with it.. We only ordered one serving but they gave us so many. They were perfectly crisp and yet moist so delicious.  If you are in Phoenix you NEED to come try this place out!"}
{"text":"I liked the food yhats the reason came here. But server was too busy to attend  us. They need to hire more staff yo serve."}
{"text":"Hi,  I will explain why I am giving a 2 star review ! Food Quality is excellent BUT my reason of giving a 2 Star is pricing. Menu Prices on Yelp are different as to the Menu Prices in the restaurant. This is giving a consumer a false impression about the prices. I am serious, this is not right.   Message to the owner - If you think I am right then you should compensate me for the difference. I am willing to come back and order the same food but you should charge me per the menu prices on Yelp, if not, I understand but I am not coming back to your place.  Thank You !"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much more 5 star for me. The service was superb. Very attentive and friendly; the food was better than anything I can get in the state of Utah, and the prices nearly blew me away BEFORE I GOT MY FOOD!  Once the food came everyone at our table was almost in dis belief at the quality for our dollar. The only negative about this place is how embarrassing it was to ask for the mountain of to go boxes because we weren't able to finish our delicious food that we refused to waste because it was so Devine.  Is this where I mention that I lived in India and know my Indian Food?? Lol  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I was suckered into visiting this spot by Guy Fieri and his show. I wanted this place to be good. My wife and I have eaten a lot of Indian/Pakistani food across the world, and I know I can't compare it to other countries. This was the worst representation of the respective cuisines. Before we talk food, let's talk service. We sat for 25 minutes without knowing who our server was or even being greeted after we sat down. My wife gave me sound advice and I ignored, bc I was wanting to believe the reviews and show. After, I blocked the server from passing me I got service. He hastily took our order then we sat for another 20min. before getting 1 of our 2 appetizers. Then 10 min. We received our food with our 2nd app. The samosas were ok, and masala fries were cold. The main dishes were rushed and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen food aisle. I highly recommend passing this place by if you want a good meal."}
{"text":"I ordered curry and wasn't totally impressed, especially since this is the specialty.  Both of friends had excellent meals, but mine was just OK.  They did allow us to purchase beer (or wine) at the liquor store next door and bring it into the restaurant.  That is a rare privilege in Arizona.  I will go back and may even try a different type of curry.  The place was packed and everybody else seemed to be enjoying their meals."}
{"text":"I love this place. Like I've said in other reviews, I'm a student, so I appreciate a deal. I'm also a foodie and have expensive taste, so I love when the three can come together on rare occasions, and bless me with great food!   I love Indian food, especially Pakistani and Punjabi. I'm still trying things on the menu but so far, the Chicken Tikka was flavorful, I wish I would've gotten their wonderful saffron rice with it, instead of the regular basmati, but saving money, it tasted just as great. The Aloo Palak, potatoes with sautéed spinach and spices was a great vegetarian meal and went perfect with rice and their GREAT garlic Nan.   I also had the the Goat Biryani and though I loath bones, the meat and saffron rice with the rendered fat from stewing made it worth the extra effort of getting through the many bones (that is to be expected with any goat dish at many ethnic restaurants and is part of the dining experience). Very well done dish.  Yes the atmosphere is laid back, but the owner caters to us college students and that keeps the cost down, I think they're the most reasonable Indian restaurant in the valley, that alone will keep me coming back. The service is good, laid back as well, the owner is very kind and attentive, again the food is great so I'll be back often, you should definitely pop your head in and start with some Nan and let your mind wander through the many choices..  They even have daily specials, like Halal Kung Pao Chicken one day..."}
{"text":"This Indian food is amazing. So authentic and tasty. I constantly crave Curry Corner. If you like Indian food this is definitely the place to go. Great for college students because it isn't too expensive, but it is a great and filling meal. Would recommend to anyone who lives in the area or is just visiting."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken tikka masala, just as good as my favorite Indian restaurant back in Philadelphia. If you're near Tempe you should really try curry corner... And get the garlic naan."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last two weeks on the recommendation of my co-workers and ordered the same thing both times. They give you a ton of food and it's really good. You can easily get two big meals from a single order or the biryani and the naan is excellent. Check this place out. I took out both times so I have no idea about the service, so bear that in mind."}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint!  Our favorite Indian restaurant!  We drive 45 mins to eat here. Our favorite dishes are to start, the tiki masala fries.  (I dream about these!) The garlic naan is to die for.  The tiki masala and butter chicken are top notch.  The owners are kind and friendly.  We  this place!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Ordered a bunch of takeout and it was awful. Vegetable Handi swimming in a vat of oil. Flavorless Dahl. Soggy undercooked fries. The plain basmati rice was the best thing I ate. It's all going in the trash, and I hate to waste food."}
{"text":"Remarkably good food (two tikkas), promptly served, hot and tasty, and far from eye-poppingly expensive. Our server was a delight -- attentive and helpful without being a hoverer. I promised him a stellar review, and this is it."}
{"text":"We already had a bad experience with vegetable thali served at this place. One of my friends told me its somewhat revamped and apparently the food quality has changed and it tastes much better now. Nothing like that, on the contrary its has worsened.  We ordered mango lassi, paneer tikka masala(comes with naan or rice), garlic naan, tawa parantha , and veggie biryani. They couldn't serve the biryani cz they were out vegetables (whaatt!!! ) . So we ordered malai kodta with rice instead.   Ok lets not talk about authenticity and getting that real taste with the proper ingredients with almost all the reataurants claiming to serve Indian food here in Tempe. I 've made my peace with that long back. But then this place surprised with how pathetic their food quality and taste can be.  The paneer and kofta were served with the same curry base which felt like someone just opened a tomato paste can. added some random spices and served it with paneer and kofta. Wait, I am missing some important ingredient. I got up in the end to wash my hands , (restrooms!! lets spare them here) and this red color wont go off my hands. So they did have some artificial color added as well. We are also missing some surprise ingredient here which made out stomachs go haywire after having our dinner.  And btw the rice never came. Asked them twice. The cashier showed us the order slip and told that the server missed out rice so its not our fault=). He did correct himself and was gracious enough to give us a $2 discount."}
{"text":"A cozy Indian restaurant that serves several different types of curries and meats at a reasonable price. This place seems family owned and was featured on a Guy Fieri show, and they have a rather large display of him behind their cashier.   I came with over 10 of my family members and we tried an assortment of dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty average- it was a tad too spicy and I thought served an unsatisfying amount of chicken. The naan bread was also only OK, I preferred it with garlic but found some pieces slightly burned. I also tried a bit of the mixed tandoori grill and there was barely any flavor or seasoning, although the meat was tender. The best dish was a green curry lamb, which had good flavor.  This place is affordable and good for groups, but just standard in terms of Indian food."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had. The Chicken Tikki Masala was incredible. It would be 5 stars if the waitress hadn't been so apathetic. The food was worth the mediocre service though! I've found my new favorite Indian place!"}
{"text":"Would love to give this place 5 stars but the service is just so bad here. However, the food is really great!! Our waiter though seemed to be taking care of everyone else but us. Keep in mind this place is very small and wasn't very busy so I don't see why we had to wait so long for any attention. Took about 15 minutes before anyone even said a word to us. Be warned you seat yourself when you come in here and drinks are self serve. Maybe if they had 1 or 2 more waiters working they would be able to handle the customer flow."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Arizona by far!  My two friends and I met up for dinner here for the first time. We ordered hummus, tandoori chicken and I believe yellow chicken curry. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"There is some yelp-star inflation going on in Tempe.  Curry Corner is a prime example.  We were really shocked at how bad the curries we had were, although the wrap was just OK.  The curries had the vibe that they had just come out of a can, and were quite flavorless.   We've tried a few Indian places, and so far the best Indian we've had in the valley is \"Star of India\" on Chandler Rd. in Phoenix (Ahwatukee)."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the lowest I can go is one star. If I could I would go lower I would. We went in to a restaurant with tons of open seats, no lines and a waiter that obviously not busy and gave us a few glances but no assistance. We awkwardly sat ourselves waited for someone to get to us, and they never did. So we quickly decided to go next door."}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone loves this place. I went in with high hopes because of all the great reviews and recommendations from friends. We walked in, the place was totally empty and no server in sight. No music just a TV playing the food channel. After an awkward silent min a server comes out the back. Our server was totally awkward.  When the food was ready he literally brought one thing out at a time. The food was soooo boring. The blandest Indian food I have ever eaten. Maybe it's just the vegetarian items that is so tasteless?"}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special. The service was kind of ok.  My experience: if u are going special night out, this won't be a great fit.."}
{"text":"I used to go there and think they r the best! Lol even the daal cost like 7.5 dollars which should cost like 3 I rather have ramen and noodles at and goat feet at Chen's Noodle house or Fleming Dragon ! Even a plate of gyro and rice costs like 10 dollars at Shawrma Paradise! Their Birwani rice is made with colors on the top of white rice, it's not real spices, if you wanna have real thing! Then go to Tasty Kobob, Istanbul Cafe was great sadly they r no moreee!  Curry Corner has a lot of fake items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here because I saw it on triple D's, the food was excellent! Had naan and hummus to start, nothing too special but I love naan and hummus. I had the tandoori chicken tikka and my husband had the Afghani boti. Both came with some sort of cilantro lime rice and some kind of spicy onions which which was absolutely delicious! The tandoori chicken was sooo flavor packed and cooked to perfection!  The afghani boti was really good but not my favorite.  Service was friendly but really slow, I kept thinking they forgot about us. The tables were dirty and the lighting lacking. Overall, really great Indo-Pak food, highly recommend if you have a lot of time to eat!"}
{"text":"No clean and average food. Non-vegetarian Thali is waste of money.   Id you want to taste good India food I don't suggest here"}
{"text":"The Curry Corner hits the spot every time! They have excellent quality food, and pricing is also very reasonable! Portion sizes are above average & if you leave here still hungry, it's your own fault! The curries, masalas, kormas are all spiced perfectly & balanced. The mango lassi was cool, creamy and refreshing & I find comfort in the warm, inviting atmosphere. The service is quick, polite and attentive. I have loved everything I have ever had from the Curry Corner, & you will too!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here, great flavor and good portions. I especially liked the biriyani, it was quite different from what my Indian palate considers as biriyani, but nevertheless it totally hit the spot on many levels. I would go eat here over and over again."}
{"text":"Great Tandoori Chicken.  The garlic naan was really good too! The server was much better. He was a big guy, disnt know his name but the friendly sevice and gteat food gets them a 5!"}
{"text":"I went here last week with a large group (6 people). We ordered 5 dishes including two orders of chicken tikka masala, goat curry, chicken achari, and palak paneer. Overall we all (including one friend who is Indian) thought it was not the best Indian food we have had....the tikka masala was alright, but wasn't as rich or flavorful as other tikka masalas I have had. I did not care for the chicken achari, but I have not had that before, so it may just not be something I like in general. The palak paneer was alright, but again, was somewhat bland. The goat curry, in my opinion, was the best thing we had. It had a lot of goat flavor (which I like), and was generally tasty. The meals all came with either rice or naan, but disappointingly, the rice was plain white rice (no spices in it like most basmati rices) and the naan was also plain. Still nice that it was included...which brings me to the reason this place is 3 stars and not 2....it is soo inexpensive! We each paid six dollars and change for all of that food....most places would be well over 10$ each, so that is worth an extra star all on its own. I probably wouldn't come here if you want amazing food, but if you want decent food on the cheap, this is your place!"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Tempe! Curry Corner has recently expanded the size and refurnished the layout of the restaurant. The food is always great. I would suggest the non-vegetarian thali that offers 3 different types of curries, rice, yogurt, and plain naan. This will fill you up!"}
{"text":"So we came here on our lunch break because we wanted to try something new in our lives... plus we heard great review about it since it was on Diners Drive Ins & Dives...  I've never had  any type of Indian/Pakistan food before so this was going to be quite an experience for me. We ordered the Tikka Masala Fries which were bomb.com. The sauce on it was reallyyyyy good. For the entrees we got the Mixed Grilled Sizzler and the Afghani Boti. Everything was a bit spicy for me since I'm a wuss when it comes to that stuff. lol. I liked the meat in the Afghani Boti and the sauce that it comes with.   The service... was extremely slowwwwww... It took maybe 20 minutes before we even got our waters. We ordered the fries as an appetizer. Which never came out. They ended up coming out with everything else. Other then that it was quite an experience. I might come back if I'm ever in the mood for something different in my life again. =)"}
{"text":"Very kind staff! Also very knowledgeable and helpful about middle eastern food. I asked the server to give me the most unique, farthest possible from the US middle eastern item, and the man helped me choose a \"garafe\" or something written like that. It was lovely!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Do it. Went here over the summer after seeing it on Diners,Drive-Ins,and Dives. No one else was there,totally foreign atmosphere where you aren't really sure if they understand what you're saying and you are kind of guessing what they are saying,which adds to the mystique of the place. Very polite server.Super cool decor. We ordered what Guy had on the show,Tandori chicken tikki,goat Karahi,and had the naan and probably some other stuff I don't even remember. It was all amazing,we were so impressed. Can't wait to be back in AZ to go feast here again!"}
{"text":"They have a \"help wanted\" sign so they are short handed which made the service on the slow side. HOWEVER I still gave a five star review. The food was phenomenal! For considering themselves \"fast-curry\" the depth of flavor screams complexity. Thanks for a meal that even my 6 & 8 year old enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I became a regular the first night I visited this restaurant. The Arabian platter was always my favorite go-to, it offers a great sampler of different flavors. Tonight I tried the chicken jalfrezi, and sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln,  it was a life-changing experience.   Spicy, creamy sauce,  huge tender lumps of chicken,  onions and yellow peppers. I mixed in some rice and a drizzle of lemon yogurt, and it was eye-rollingly, mind-blowingly spectacular. I am ruined."}
{"text":"So went there today even after all the mixed reviews. Ordered Garlic Naan, Cheese Naan (more like a Naanadilla), Some kind of chicken wings, some kind of rice with specks of orange colored things and the grilled mixed meat which is there version of a fajita platter with 2 kinds of chicken, ground meat hot dog looking thing and grilled onions and peppers. Be warned however if you do not like cilantro, as tons of cilantro were on everything we ordered. The service was better than antipated, the dining area was clean and the food very flavorful. $30 for two people and we have a third meal sitting in the fridge for later."}
{"text":"First time here today ..saw this place on diner drive ins and dives ..it's a great find. The garlic naan was my fave we also tried the cheese naan it was ok. I had the mix grilled sizzler it was delicious. The chutney sauce was great! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"s/o and I decided to swing by this place after doing our touristy visits.  He wanted to come here so badly because apparently Guy Fieri featured this place (sure enough it was, as evidenced by ginormous photo of him plastered nearby the cashier wall).  We ordered the tikka masala fries to start, and while the fries were kind of on the soggy side, it was so addicting. We kept grabbing for them. The spice was good, must recommend!  I got the chicken makhani and it was SUPER DELICIOUS. the chicken was a bit dry but the flavoring and the spice was spot on. Went perfect with the naan or the rice. I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants and this definitely tops it, was so pleasantly surprised!  My s/o got the traditional chicken curry and he loved it as well. Said the flavoring was great and that it was spicy but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"This is a very good value for North Indian and Northwest Frontier Food.  The food is a cross between Pakistani, Indian, and Afghani.    The Boti Kebab is good.  My wife ordered the non-vegetarian thali.  The portions were huge!!  She liked it, and took the leftovers home.  My wife's nephew (from Vietnam) liked his chicken kebabs.  He said it was well prepared.    My wife says she will come back because of the great value.  The only drawback she had was that perhaps certain things were slightly salty for her.  That is why it is 4 stars and not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst food with worst service. They took the order then after half an hour the guy comes and says that out of all the food you ordered only one thing is available. As other places were almost closed, we had to order other stuff. After 30 mins food comes and it looks so bad, I cannot even explain. No combination of proper masala. Only 2 small chicken pieces in chicken curry.   One of the worst experience. Won't come here again ever."}
{"text":"Best curry I've had in tempe. My favorite is the Arabian Thali plate. I never feel sick after I eat here; I have a feeling they use good, fresh ingredients.   Customer service isn't always the greatest, but for the food and the prices I can deal :)"}
{"text":"Great honest and delicious food! We've been there twice now and I can't wait to go back. We had the goat kahari, lamb kahari and a fish & shrimp kahari, my husband and daughters shared them. The favorite of both my daughters was the fish and shrimp kahari. It comes with rice and we added the garlic naan bread. I really enjoyed the spicy chicken biryani, it was a big portion and so flavorful I couldn't stop eating it. The restaurant is not very fancy, but we felt very comfortable and the service is friendly. The entire menu is great and so very affordable. I hope they never change!"}
{"text":"First time trying these genre of food, and the price and flavor is incredible. Staff are kind, however they do not wear restaurant attire. Moreover, great place."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this place.  Based on other reviews, we were worried about the amount of food we would receive and if it would be packaged well, but we were pleasantly surprised that we received a normal amount of food and nothing was spilled or leaking.  The food itself tasted good, but it was just entirely too greasy and oily.  The vegetable handi we ordered was just sitting in so much oil.  The spinach curry and tikka masala were also swimming in far too much oil.  I did enjoy the texture of the naan, fluffy yet crispy on the bottom.  The samosas tasted nice but they did not provide the red and green dipping sauce, which is the best part of eating samosas!  Without the sauces it's just fried mashed up potatoes.  I will likely not order from here again, but I do not regret ordering from here, if that makes sense.  FYI tip for others - the medium spice level is really not that spicy at all. if you are looking for a bit of heat, go for hot!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Boti Kebab is phenomenal--the chicken is tender and full of flavor, and it is served with great pickled onions and a delicious green sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of my favorite place for Indo-Paki food in entire Arizona. Service is not the best but food is delicious.   We ordered Chicken Tekka Masala and Lamb Tekka Masala with Garlik Naan and Rice.  The chicken and lamb was done right and really delicious.   If you go with two people, order one main dish, rice and bread that will be enough for two people."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots in the valley. I often crave their tikka masala fries. My husband and I both love the chicken tikka masala and chicken mahkni. The tandoori chicken is super yummy and we always get at least two cheese naan to go with our meals. The Arabian Thali plate is a great way to get a lot of yummy stuff together!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my order. I ordered 2 chicken tandoori, chicken archari, 1 garlic naan, 1 plain naan and 1 order of rice. I asked the server if he had put my order in right and I repeated my order to him before I paid for it. The server said everything was there. When I got home the order was wrong. I got chicken tandoori, chicken archari, but I got 2 plain naan and no rice. I was charged for the naans and rice when it comes with the meal. I tried calling them and it keeps on coming busy. This has not happened the first time. This is the second time it's gone wrong"}
{"text":"I usually love the food but I don't recommend them when they are even marginally busy. Only half the tables were full when I arrived. It took almost 10 minutes of standing at the register to put in a to go order and it's been 40 minutes and counting and I still don't have my food. They said it would be 10 minutes. I asked about it at the 25 minute mark.  Ok update: 44 minutes. If I had known it would be so bad I would have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very tasty curry. Amazing fries and naan. And I finally tried goat. I'd definitely make another trip when we are on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I discovered Curry Corner recently when an Armenian cab driver I rode with, told me Curry Corner was his favorite restaurant and he eats there Thursday least once or twice a week.  So I ate there, once, about 4 weeks ago.  No white people were in there, which may be a good sign of authenticity.  I had a goat kahari dish, was good!!  Warning, when server asked me if I wanted garlic Naan or plain, or course I said garlic, but she did not tell me garlic cost extra over plain.  The owner took the extra off my bill, cos server did not tell me.  Owner told the server she mush tell people garlic naan cost more.  Nothing much on the menu was over $12.  Tandoori chicken looks good too.  This place is for all the Indian ASU  students to eat here for affordable price.  I will come here again with more people and eat family style.  Sept 15, 2017, I came here to eat again with two eating buddies.  Prices really went up from those posted here on yelp.  The menu was covered with little white stickers reflecting the price changes, I'd saty 20% more than the prices in the photos of the menus and the menu link on Yelp.  I had the mixed grill for $12.50 (two kinds of chicken and seekh kabab.  I told my server to make sure my chicken is not hard and dry .  When it came, it was still kinda dry.  The table next to me had grilled chicken too, and theirs was not as dry, they pried it open and showed me.  Wild Diner buddy had chicken mahani with the cream gravy - REALLY GOOD, I think she had the best dish.  I t hink I will have that next time.  Other Wild Diner had Nehari Noor Jehan, which she said was spicy!    The service was hit and miss from a tall white guy.  We even laughed, cos he brought water glasses without straws (people at other tables all had straws).  So one of us asked for straws, but later he brought only HER a straw.  i said i would like a straw too, and my other eating buddy said same, so then he brought us two more straws.  Later, he brought us more straws, like he forgot he already brought us straws.  My chicken pieces were really large and needed a knife, so I had to ask for a knife in order to not eat like a cave man.  I also had to ask for a spoon.    I think this second visit - food 4 stars (I tasted the other diners choices), service 3 (cos he was friendly and not rude otherwise it would be a 2 star), tho a bit hodge podge.    We arrived on a Friday at 6 pm.  At 8 pm, the restaurant was totally full of people, except one booth in the corner.  YOUNG people, mostly whites (as opposed to Indians)."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The authentic smell and limited menu make this place a real keeper. I've tried about ten things on the menu so far and I have no complaints. The servings are generous and the garlic naan is amazing!  Prices are extremely reasonable, generally a bit cheaper then other Indian restaurants in the Tempe area. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is inviting, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from them, staff was very nice however food was not ready within quoted time. Waited about an additional 10 minutes in the cramped seating area, food was great but sadly our order was wrong when we got home :/. Probably won't eat there again"}
{"text":"This is the only Indian restaurant in Tempe that I go to. It is amazingly fresh and has a wide variety of authentic selections. Because of its popularity it is often busy and sometimes takes a few minutes to be greeted, however, this adds to the authenticity of the experience. I'm a vegetarian and there is a wide variety. If you like good fresh food, you can't miss this place."}
{"text":"Too good. The quality and quantity of food they offer for such low price is kind of fantastic. This is the only indian restaurant in Arizona where I ate stomach full and charged under $10. Even though the prices are low, the taste/quality of the food is better than many other Indian restaurants. In addition to the good food and ambience, the service is excellent too. They are pleasant, courteous and prompt. This is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  + Located in a strip mall next to a tattoo shop. Lots of parking, which is a plus. + Staff are friendly and restaurant is clean. - Bathroom isn't so clean. + Food is good, and not spicy if you have a sensitive stomach. I think it could have used more of a kick, though, to be honest. - Flavors are solid but maybe a little watered down. I'd have to try more dishes to really say for sure. + Chicken tikka masala is a safe way to go if you've never had Indian food. + Reasonable prices.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here, she was visiting from Houston.   I've seen it on RED and have past it on the light rail many times.  It was really good!!!!  We got there right before the rush.  The waitresses were really nice and accommodating.  We loaded up on food...samosas, hummus, tandoori chicken took a, garlic naan wish we had room for more.  I can't wait to go back to try other items.  The chicken had a great flavor, the hummus was light.  I would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I freaking love Indian food. We had a business trip in Scottsdale, AZ, and after watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and seeing that Tempe was just 10 minutes up the road, we made it our mission to try Curry Corner. I had high hopes for this place to blow my mind.  We were served quickly, but the meal left much to be desired. We started with samosas which were really good. However the water they brought us tasted like it came out of a hotel swimming pool - very chlorine-y.   I asked if I could have tikka masala, except made with shrimp instead of chicken (usually an option at most Indian places). The server said he \"would ask, but the cook is sometimes funny about stuff like that.\" I didn't understand how difficult it could be to put tikka masala sauce over shrimp instead of chicken, but I was ultimately served shrimp tikka masala. What a disappointment! The sauce literally tasted like Campbell's soup, or ketchup. Just plain tomato sauce. I don't know if this is some side sauce that was whipped up to satisfy my request for shrimp in place of chicken and just wasn't the normal tikka that is used, but I was pretty sad about the whole thing. Had I known it would so negatively affected my meal overall, I would have just stuck with chicken.  The rice was flavorless. Normally I can eat rice from my favorite Indian places plain, because it's so delicious and cooked with cinnamon, cilantro, cardamom, etc. The rice not only didn't taste seasoned, but it also took on the chlorine taste from the water. They would really benefit from installing a water filter in their restaurant.  My husband had chicken makhani which WAS really good. The cheese and garlic naan were also both delicious.  I wish I could give my experience a better rating, but it was ultimately a disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Casual, very casual, casual in many respects.  There is decent to good food here depending on what is ordered, and it comes out rather fast, and it is lower priced than most Indian restaurants in the valley.  But there are a few drawbacks to dining here.  Though you're paying a couple bucks less per entree, you're also in a not so clean place that has a lot of wear on it other than perhaps the newish large flat panel TV on the wall.  This was one of those times where I realized that maybe it is worth the price difference.  There was only one server for the entire little restaurant on our visit, so I can see how that was frustrating for the other table that was there before us but ordered after us.  The Mexican hot sauce (Cholula) on each table was an interesting observation."}
{"text":"Good authentic Indian food. Garlic naan is exactly how they make in India. Arabian Thaali has tasty chicken tikka and biryani. Punjabi Handi is another delicious option to try. Their lassis are also good esp. Mango lassi. The customer service is always good everytime I visit. The ambience is ok. The place is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurant ever. I can't believe that are still in business. Food is mediocre, and the service is the absolute worst. Being rude and ignoring customers must be in their employee hand book. If you hate people the the guy running the cash register does, get out of the restaurant business. Stay away from this establishment."}
{"text":"Really great food: the chicken tikka masala was spicy but not overpowering, and the meat was cooked perfectly. Lovely flavor! The mango lhassi was also quite delicious. The only downside was the wait. I had called ahead so the order would be ready, but when I showed up I still had to wait about 15 minutes. But they were really busy, which is a good sign, so maybe it evens out. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I don't have curry all the time and I haven't had it in tons of places, but I went to Curry Corner when it was on Lemon and I hunted it down to find it on Apache, too. This curry rules so hard!"}
{"text":"This place is normally good but there is this guy who works there and he's a total douche. It's like he hates his life so much that he takes all of his insecurities and puts them on you. I usually don't order takeout because there might be a chance I have to talk to this dude. Idk if he's mad or just a douche, but this guy make me never order takeout. \"jeez dude, calm down\"  I also had a hair in my food, so I don't eat there.  If you do go there you better hope you get the good staff and hope you get the curry from the hairless pot."}
{"text":"I got take out and just started eating a few minutes ago. I ask for no cilantro in my traditional chicken curry and there was cilantro. I also ordered tandoori chicken wings and it was raw but very burnt on the outside. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.  If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!"}
{"text":"Hi got the vegetable Handi and it was good but there was hardly any sauce so it was hard to dip nan into it. Speaking with the waiter he didn't seem to understand what \"vegan\" meant - i guess that makes this place authentic, like you're actually traveling overseas.  The food was good though and the nan was the best i've ever had.  Very inexpensive too.  Very slow service and the environment is like a cafeteria. Again, very authentic."}
{"text":"Not terrible but far from great. Service is very poor and order was incomplete. No cutlery, no plates.  It is cheap but overall not worth it."}
