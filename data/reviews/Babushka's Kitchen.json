{"text":"I married into a Polish family and really do love Polish food, so Babushka's is the perfect restaurant for my family and I to enjoy!  My husband always orders the \"Hunter's Feast,\" which is the largest and most expensive entree on the menu.  He loves it!  I order different entrees and really don't have a favorite.  This restaurant is definitely worth the trip there!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome.  The stuffed cabbage is just and I mean just like my aunt made growing up.  Pierogi is huge but tender dough, flavorful filling.  Their tomato dumpling soup is to die for--I seriously wish I could have a gallon to take home.  I think it's cool that they serve entrees with fresh rye bread and butter--it really DOES make you think you are back at your Baba's house for dinner.  Polkas repeat like every 20 minutes so that's a bit annoying (the first time I heard \"Who stole the kishka?\" it was nostalgic, by the third time I was afraid I would NEVER get it out of my head!).  Only thing that wasn't up to par was the potato pancake--tough, tough even though the flavor was okay.   Can't wait to take my whole family there when we're in the area--so my kids can taste what my Sunday family dinners were like growing up.....they also have apple pierogi desserts (?) which may be worth trying...their kolacky looked great, but they are pricey...."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  I had lunch here today.  It was different ordering at the counter but the lunch specials were explained very well.  The smoked keilbasa sandwich was over flowing with toppings and the cucumber salad was delicious.  I would also recommend the perogie but be careful they are \"jumbo\"."}
{"text":"Definitely will go back. Three of us. 2 had hunter's platter, one had gatherers plater with sauerkraut and dumplings. 2 of us started with czarina soup. It was perfect for us, best I've had in a while. the 2 that had hunter's had mashed potatoes with red gravy, 1 had green beans, the other cabbage and dumplings (ummm).  Food was great, huge quantity. It came quickly. Good service. We liked the light polka music in the background. If you like Polish food, this is a restaurant you must go to!"}
{"text":"I went there expecting something very commercial and sterilized for the public masses. BOY WAS I MISTAKEN!  This was like going to Grandma's home.  The food was cooked just like what I had as a kid. The portions are big and true to the polish way. If you are not Polish you might not enjoy the food as a REAL Polish person would.  The counter ordering is a bit different and the lack of frills speak volumes of the economical Polish way of doing things. Anybody else just would not understand. I need them to open one up in Lake County and soon. (Yes, there are a lot of DPs out here too) I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Good food.  However Never do catering with them.  They will bail on you at the last minute and will not try to accommodate a customer.  Because of this I will not be back which is tough because I love this type of food."}
{"text":"I know what you are wondering...is Babushka's better than Sokolowski's?  Ring the bell, here we go.  Babushka's is a no frills, walk up to the counter and order your food and grab a number and wait joint.  Plain wood tables, banquet style chairs.  I appreciated that you could order so many side dishes because I am a light eater.  I settled on the jumbo pierogi (they had 4 flavors to choose from the night we went), cinnamon apple sauce, and smoked kielbasa which came served in a crock with sauerkraut and dumplings.  All were very tasty I have to say.  The boyfriend got the chicken paprikash, tomato soup and finished all of my leftovers.  He thinks the food here is better and more authentic tasting than Sokolowski's (but of course none of it is as good as his grandma's...)  Sokolowski's offers more Americanized choices whereas Babushka's is straight up Polish.  We will definitely go back.  Our food arrived quickly and hot by a little old lady.  Is she Babushka?  You decide."}
{"text":"Drove 4 hours to eat here and it was wonderful and well worth the trip. Get the hunters plate which is a sampler! It will fill you up"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a tiny hole in the wall in the godforsaken south-eastern Cleveland suburbs.    Now that we've gotten that out of the way, lets continue with the RELEVANT information.  Babushka's Kitchen is a lovely little hole in the wall just past Sagamore Hills, but not quite in Macedonia.  I think the actual address is somewhere in Northfield Center...but don't quote me on that...whatever the city...its on Olde Route 8.  The menu is expansive, the prices are low, and the portions are abundant.  As such, it serves a wide variety of Polish delights, including but not limited to: Perogi, Golabki, Kielbasa, and (for desert) Kolachki.  Truth be told, I'd go for the light, fluffy, flaky, li'l Kolachkis alone.  That's cuz I'm a fat guy though.  If, for some bizarre reason, you are in Cleveland...or...for some even more bizarre reason are from Cleveland and haven't left yet...please...visit Babushka's Kitchen.  If you're into God...no joke...St. Barnabas is across the street...make a day of it?  Extra special note:  If you're into Polka and God...you know that in heaven there is no beer...so that's why we drink it here.  There doesn't seem to be any at Babushka's Kitchen either.  But there is a Panini's right down the street if you feel the need.  Also, try the Hunter's Feast.  I don't want to ruin any surprises, but to quote Chuck Palahniuk, it's \"enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.\""}
{"text":"Great Polish eats! This small hole in the wall place kicks out so amazing homemade food."}
{"text":"When I come \"home\" to Cleveland, I like to enjoy the Slavic delicacies...and that's what you get a Babushka's Kitchen.  I went with friends - I had a combo plate that had a cabbage roll, a yummy potato/cheese pierogi & you get to choose a side - I chose cabbage & noodles...it was a wonderful choice all the way around. This is not a fancy place...go expecting a mom & pop place with good comfort food & you'll leave happy.   Oh...the kolachke's were probably the best I've ever had...took a box home & didn't share with anyone!"}
{"text":"Being polish this bring me back to my grandmas kitchen, I love the mushroom and Swiss perogies."}
{"text":"SREDNIA!!  Ok, before you dig out your English-Polish dictionary, I'll help you out with the translation here - -  \"AVERAGE\"  ABSTRACT:  From the decor to the flavor, this place gets a solid C in my book.  COME HERE FOR:  pierogis, chicken noodle soup, kolachky  DON'T COME HERE FOR:  ambiance, efficient service, stuffed cabbage  A resident of Independence, I waited with great anticipation for the opening of Babushka's after our hometown family restaurant closed up shop some 16 months prior.  We waited and waited, and figured something glorious MUST be transforming behind those papered up windows.  Not so much.  Babushka's is a counter-style ordering restaurant with wait staff to bring your food.  Protocol is as follows:  Stand in line, choose dinner from overhead sign, order, pay, get your plastic glass, shuffle to pop machine, choose a wooden bench or chair, be seated, prop your number on the plastic doily table cloth and wait for your food.  The elderly wait staff will bring (hopefully) your order some 20-25 minutes later, roughly at the same time that the Frank Yankovic Jr. Greatest Hits polka CD starts over on the boombox propped in the corner.  Not kidding.  When our food was finally delivered it was: a) cold b) not what we ordered c) bland d) nearly spilled on us e) all of the above. Yep - you guessed it!  So, not a great place for sights or service, but what about the food??  Chicken noodle soup - the crown jewel of my meal.  Plump chunks of chicken and plenty of perfectly cooked noodles and veggies.  The noodles may have lost their excitement earlier in the day, but I'll bet a fresh batch would be YUMMO  Stuffed cabbage - Huge but bland.  The meat and sauce did not pack enough Polish flavor.  Disappointing but tastier the following day with some crushed black and red pepper added.  Pierogis - I had the potato and cheese.  HUGE and rather tasty!  I definitely recommend them.  They would probably be delicious hot.  Kolachky - AMAZING!!  Probably the best I've had in the area.  Buttery and flaky apricot goodness that melts in your mouth!!  Sooooooooo...  The food was actually 3 stars overall, but the setting and the staff kick it down to a solid 2. Maybe I'm being too hard on a \"mom and pop shop\" selling \"comfort food\" but 16 months is a long time to wait for srednia!!"}
{"text":"This review also hurts to write. The Pierogies were hard as a rock. Boiled, yes but probably 6-8 hours ago. Pierogis are supposed to be boiled and lightly bathed in butter. That is the correct way to prepare them. Not fried. Not deeped fried. If the dry out, they need to be reboiled until they rise to the top. Again, bathe in butter, serve with slotted spoon. The polish cucumber salad was unique though not really authentic. I did like that the  waitstaff was very attentive and went out of their way to satisfy us. The Kolaczki were out of this world amazing. Best I be ever had. I've only been here once, so my review does not warrant any prejudices because one must try a place several times before one can offer a decent opinion on a place."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with I'm not polish, but I did grow up eating many polish dishes.  I just went today, I tried to keep an open mind. I had read the reviews & thought are these people being too critical? The answer is NO, the food is average at best, the service is lackluster & unattentive.   The best thing about Babushka's Kitchen is definitely the Handmade Kolachky & they really aren't that good. The lunch portions aren't really that big, my sister looked forward to getting home because one of their \"large\" pierogies & a tossed salad would not be enough for your 98lb spinster aunt. And what's up with a plain piece of rye bread on the side with most meals, our entire party pooled the left over bread & sent it all home.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for someplace to eat for lunch, bored with all of the usual places around my work. I called in the order and picked it up. I got the lunch portion of chicken paprikash and mashed potatoes. When I picked up my order, it was ready to go. Everyone was very friendly when I was paying for my food. Once I got back to work, I surprised to see how big the lunch portion was! It was very flavorful. A lot of places around have very bland paprikash but this was tasty and delicious. I will definitely come back to try some of the other things on the menu! The only bad thing I can say is that I had a hard time finding the place. It's somewhat hidden in the plaza. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"As a polish citizen trying introduce locals to polish food I was very disappointed. Food quality was ok, but service was terrible. I am pretty sure, that it would by hard to find such a rude staff in the entire Poland nowadays. We were picking up an order to go (thank God, that we decided to do that instead dining in), once we were making sure everything was ok (order for 6 people), we were attacked by two ladys (one of them supposedly chef). Pretty much they told us to pay and get the hell out of there. just like I said, we were just checking out boxes and compering a list with boxes - standing on the side. Sad but true. So much for polish community in Ohio."}
{"text":"I grew up on chicken paprikash - so I was pretty excited about this place. It was ok, but I thought it was too pricy for just ok.   There was a lot on the menu - all home cooking comfort food. Decent portions, but just didn't compare to moms!"}
{"text":"This is the best polish food I have had in the area.  The perogies are number 1 for a reason.    The interior is not large and not made for comfort.  The pastries are very delicate and tasty.  I am glad I work near this place.   It will be a regular lunch location.  Recommend: Kielbasa sausage sandwich, stuffed cabbage, and ladylocks."}
{"text":"i like the food, the place is very cute, but some of the waitress' are extremely slow (you will know who if you go there) and it is a tad over priced.  Paprikash is good, perogies are yummy, and the pork roast is tasty. The Chicken Soup is good, but tomato soup needs work."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, the stuffed cabbage is to die for!   A little less sugar in the 'kraut would be nice.  This is my favorite Polish restaurant.  Disregard the critics words and find out for yourself what this unique boutique restaurant can offer YOU.  Have you tried their Lenten meals?   Oy ..."}
{"text":"Culture and ethnicity are rare in the land of suburbia. Instead, these residential areas are overrun with chains and monotony. Variety is scarce. In these areas, places like Babushka's typically don't exist. That to me is what I find most inspiring and refreshing.  Places like these are important in building a sense of community. They are locally run and very personal. Babushka's prides themselves on homestyle cooking that's specific to their Eastern European homeland -- Pierogi's, Kielbasa, Golabki's, Paprikash, Pork & Kraut, Meatloaf, Potato Pancakes, Kolachki's and more.   Through a lot of cultures, food is the ultimate uniter. It's one of the few events where family come together throughout their busy daily lives and share a moment. That vibe and experience is accomplished at Babushka's. The dining room feels like Grandma's kitchen. It's no frills, but serves the purpose as a gathering place to scarf comforting Polish eats while Frankie Yankovic's oom-pah-pah tunes serenade the crowd.   Babushka's is warm, inviting, comforting and a rather unique experience for the area to say the least."}
{"text":"Wow, I so wanted to like this place! Boy, I hated this place. I don't know if they read other yelp reviews about being bland, but my experience was everything was incredibly over seasoned. All I could taste on the schnitzel was pepper. I still can't get the overly sweet and vinegar-y taste out of my mouth from the German potato salad and the sauerkraut. The best thing they had there was the applesauce. Their portions are huge and I am a big portion guy, but I would much have smaller portions made well than a mountain of really bad food. Side note, their menu had a couple of Brat plates that stated they were Johnsonville Brats. Don't get me wrong, I like Johnsonvilles now and again on the grill at home, but I would hope an Eastern Euro place would have something more authentic! Kind of like going to a Mexican Restaurant and have them bring you Tostitos and a jar of Salsa. All that a side, I have always felt Great Service can make up for average food and great food can make up for average service. This place has bad everything. Bad location, bad food, bad service. Seemed like a family that thought they had a great cook in it and then conned all the family elders into playing a role. The people there seem as if they are doing you a favor and could care less how your experience is. No one there has any food service experience at all! Do yourself a favor, go to Little Polish Diner in Parma and get average service and good food!"}
{"text":"Wow, great comfort food on a cold day.  The Chicken Paprikash over dumplings with the old fashioned green beans on the side (her way) or over egg noodles with mashed potatoes on the side (my way) is a dish that is hard to pass over when looking at the menu and they have a lot of great dishes!  It is tonight's Valentine's Day take-out.  Babushka's, Roses and Malley's Chocolate Covered Pretzels that's the ticket!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best polish food I have tried. You can't get anymore homemade authentic polish food. I was greedy and tried the Hunter's Platter. It's like a sample platter of almost everything. The food is really good.  I didn't know the platter was so big. It's a very casual dinning place and great hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Its always busy. Food is average. But others just love it. Tastes are not very sophisticated in Cleveland, where \"Polish food\" is practically nothing more than kielbasa, usually smoked like Eckrich brand, and pierogi and sauerkraut and stuffed cabbage. People here don't seem to grasp that Polish food is much more diverse and interesting than the handful of dishes found at 'Polish' restaurants here. I didn't think the food was anything special and the restaurant is cramped. But it does a lot of business for sure.   And I hate their motto \"Polish heritage foods.\" And \"Babushka\" is Russian for grandmother, its not a Polish word. So much for Polish heritage."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I loved this place!  This was my first experience eating authentic  Polish food & is a great place to bring family & friends. Our waitress was extremely friendly, the food tasted great, and I really enjoyed the opportunity to educate myself about a different culture.  Their pierogi's are made from scratch, not the typical frozen ones you'd get from most chain eateries. The prices are more than fair considering how generous their portions are and they even have an outdoor sun-like room that you can eat on. If you're far from home or miss ma's cooking then I would check this place out!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing about Lent (other than telling people I'm giving up both sobriety and celibacy for Lent...someday, someone will laugh at that) is the fish. I'm not really Catholic, but because nearly all of my friends are, to varying degrees, I get to check out new places for fish fry on Fridays.  Babushka's was our first destination. We all ordered the fish dinner. It was just okay. If you appreciate quantity over quality, you'll be happy here. There was just so much stuff plopped on the plate, and it was all white: Fish, tartar sauce, pierogies, sour cream, noodles, cole slaw, dinner roll. Other than the actual fish (which was delicious), everything was just starchy and bland and indiscernible, taste- and texture-wise.   Also, no beer.   The service was fast and friendly, and it was pretty inexpensive. I'd probably come back some other time to try the cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"My Polish- German family wanted to try something authentic and had heard about Babushka's so we made a reservation for 14 on a Saturday evening.  It was difficult finding the restaurant, poor signage. Our table was ready when we arrived to the restaurant, which was lacking atmosphere. It was crowded, cafeteria style with no decorations, warmth, color or ambiance.  Our server was not a regular waitress there, she said she was just helping out, but she was wonderful. So polite, friendly and efficient. She answered all of our questions patiently and helped us pick great meals. I opted for the Hunter's Feast platter which included a little bit of everything. It was a very large portion at what I thought was a reasonable price. Stuffed cabbage, sauerkraut, kielbasa, pierogi, cole slaw.  Everything was hot and cooked fully (which I am always leery of stuffed cabbage- often undercooked). The taste of everything was mediocre. Nothing I sampled was bad, but nothing wowed me either. I was disappointed and kept it to myself, but my family started to share their feelings and we all thought the same. The cabbage and noodles, chicken paprikash... everything was a little bland and boring. Plus, they were out of kolachki's! I feel bad leaving a poor review, because maybe some people like the unseasoned flavor. (Pepper fixes everything, right?) Like I said, nothing was bad, I ate everything. But I did take most of it home to doctor it up myself."}
{"text":"Giant pierogi and chicken paprikash and I don't have to wait 2 hours in line!? I'm sold.    Their pierogi really are huge, like as big as your hand, and they always have several flavors available.  We've ordered here for lunch several times and have always been happy with our meals.  The lunch portions are definitely more than enough food and affordable, too.  The service can be a little on the slow side, so I would recommend calling your order in if you are in a time crunch."}
{"text":"People slough skin all the time. All the time! It's true with the people who make your food, too. So, I was not out of line when I asked if the people cooking in the back wore full-arm sheathing as opposed to those little hand gloves. I was not out of line.  If the person making my messy pierogi kielbasa onion butter slice of bread lunch was scritch scratching their tattoo'd arm while preparing my food, well, guess what? Go ahead, guess. Skin cells dry-raining down on everything like parmesan cheese. I'm not saying it did happen. I'm asking and that's not out of line.   Also, is it okay for me to drink some of this grease off my plate because this expensive lunch didn't put my raging appetite to bed properly? Apparently not. Apparently I am not supposed to drink plate grease.  The food was slippery on my plate and I struggled with it. I ground away at the kielbasa and just fork-stabbed the pierogi, wolfed a chew off of it and then watched as it broke free and slapped back down into my plate. I used the rye bread to soak up what I could and ate it with my hand which was a relief since the silverware wasn't up to snuff.   My plastic cup of fountain soda was streaked with my hand-filth and there was a slick of meat fat/butter oil on the surface of the drink. It all goes down the same hatch though and I left nothing for them to eat or drink in the back room.  The experience was better than if I had ate in some yucky fast food place down in Macedopia but it cost more than a taco bell or what not.   My eight dollar plate of Polish food was worth eating but maybe not worth eight bucks or the dry-cleaning tab or the shame or the cholesterol or the sense that I would never get that twelve minutes back and that in the end we all just fade to nothing and all the dumplings and smoked meat in Northfield can't save us or our civilization or the inevitability of death. It takes beer to do that and they don't sell beer at Bab's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Unique way of ordering and receiving food. Large portions, hot food and helpful staff what more can you ask for. Clean. Traditional polka music playing at a pleasant level. A great mom and pop restaurant to come and visit. :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Unfortunately I'm from out of town do I can't hit this place more often. Gatherers platter was excellent. Coming back again tomorrow to try something else!"}
