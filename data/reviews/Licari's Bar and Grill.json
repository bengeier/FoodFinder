{"text":"Very nice family run bar.

Burgers are great. Fries are crispy and thin. They offer a full bar menu, chicken wings (boneless or bone in), chicken sandwich, burgers, steak, brats, hotdogs, etc. 

Try the Mac & Cheese bites. Sounds weird but they are really good! 

5/5 peeps!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night checking out the area.  The bartender was talking to her friends and it took another patron to get her attention for me after a few minutes of sitting there.  I ordered the bacon bleu cheddar burger which was pretty good, though it came with plastic silverware (had to ask for silverware, another minus on service) for some reason.  I'm not a fan of styrofoam or plastic use, especially when dining in.  It took a few minutes after finishing my meal and beer for the bartender to notice I was ready for my check.  I don't know if the service is typically like that, but I was not impressed by it at all.

The atmosphere was pretty loud, music was cranked up even with a few patrons there.  Patrons were loud too, and pretty vulgar, not that I really mind the vulgarity but worth mentioning for readers.  

I'll give it another shot, but the service was pretty bad.  I know people have off days, so I'm willing to check it out again sometime.  I encourage the business owners to forego the plastic silverware when dining in (and look for alternatives for take out), it's unnecessary, not cost-effective, and will very likely end up in a landfill instead of recycling."}
{"text":"The bacon blu cheddar burger maybe one of the best I have ever had!  It may have had 1/2lb of bacon on it and the beef of the burger wasn't overtaken by it.  bun was soft and fresh.. This is a hidden jem in Madison.

$3.00 pints of micro beer!  Awesome

My only warning is the wings.  If your like me and like your Buffalo wings tossed in a sauce thus isn't the place ..  but then again you should here for the Burgers..  will go out of my way to have this burger again!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! Best prices on drinks in Madison. And the food is great bar food too!"}
{"text":"Licari's is right next to the Super  8 hotel for wayward travelers who meant to stay closer to downtown Madison. It's delightful and within walking distance for those who want to get wasted and wander back to the hotel.

They have Spotted Cow on tap! Also if you ask for a double mixed drink it comes in a 16 ounce beer cup!!! awesome!!!!

Don't go there on Sunday if you are rooting for a team that is playing a Wisconsin team. We almost got heckled out of the bar. Awkward.

On the other hand, we got free chicken wing snacks during the game! (once everyone got over our Northwestern sweatshirts...)

Don't play darts. very confusing dart machine. 

bartenders are very local!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming Bar! From the staff to the guy sitting next to you! Food is amazing! Daily lunch specials during the week. Burgers are cooked to order with fresh Knoches beef! This time of the year the patio is open and a great oasis. Def a must go!"}
{"text":"The hidden gem of (almost) Fitchburg. Family-owned and ran, you can often catch 3 generations of women behind the bar that have hospitality running through their veins. 

The drinks here are strong,  the food is great [cooked in front of you], and the prices way beyond reasonable - which nowadays in Madison is rare. 

The atmosphere is classic to the \"Wisconsin Dive Bar\" feel but with a very friendly tone. This place attracts the best of its demographic - almosy every time I'm there someone insist on buying me a drink - once someone paid for my whole meal!

Furthermore, if youre a smoker, they also have a smoke room so you won't need to go outside when the weather gets cold. You can buy your cigarettes right at the bar, too. 

If you're around the Fitchburg area, skip that $11 burger at the other place and stop on by Licaris for something just as good. Friday Fish Fry is a specially good thing to enjoy. 

Great place, hidden for only those who knows where this treasure lies!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and atmosphere. Looks to be a local hangout but very welcoming. Great selection of craft beer and 30+ menu options"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  Food is inexpensive and super excellent - their fries are served hot and crispy!!!  Burgers are juicy and perfect.  Service is TERRIBLE.  We ordered at 12:05 and food wasn't delivered until 12:32 - We were never approached after we recieved our food as to how it was or if we needed a drink refill.  The place was busy and only had 1 cook and an old lady waiting tables as well as tending the bar.  She was very slow and had trouble keeping up.  I will however come back as the food was that good.  Next time, I'll call ahead to place my order!!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, the staff is friendly and the prices are quite reasonable.

However, this place is just average. Hidden behind Firehouse Subs, it is a great place for a casual, quick lunch. I order a cheeseburger with swiss. I was not asked what I wanted temperaturewise. They have several side options which include chips and various mayo-type salads. I upgraded to fries. I was a little disappointed I did this. They were standard crinkle cut. Not very impressive. 

A lunch for two under $20 is probably standard. So try this place when you are looking for a simple burger or sandwich. I would definitely go back again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today as it was a beautiful day. Food was good. Service was friendly, but it seemed as though the kitchen lost our order. took 25 min (or more) from order to receive the food. Took long enough we ended up having it packed to go. Once that request was made, they handled it quite well. Everyone reported having good food. Diddnt find any bleu on my \"Bacon Cheddar Bleu Burger\" though. 

All in all, I'll be back as the food was good and they set up the \"to go\" meals pretty well appointed. Even included a mint (though perhaps put the mint in the cold section of the container?)

Nice place for a \"dive\" bar and a nice patio. We will try again and report back."}
{"text":"Well if you want a bacon burger, you definitely get bacon when you come in here. I've never had a burger with so much bacon on it. They were super busy for the lunch hour on Friday so it did take awhile for us to get our food but it did taste really good. The bartender was friendly enough. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks during happy hour. Ok, pretty cheap drinks any time of day (The happy hour is 50 cents off a tap beer!). This is a traditional dive bar with good food. We had a couple of beers as they had a nice selection of beers on tap. They do offer some micro brews on tap too. If it's not on tap, ask if they have it in can or bottle. The menu is on the wall. Beer menu as you come in the front door. The food menu is along the back wall. After a beer, we opted to order the steak sandwich with onion rings. I read an earlier rave review about the steak sandwich and the onion rings and had to try them both. The steak is cooked to order and they have a list of toppings that you can choose from (fried onions, raw onions, cheese, lettuce, tomato, etc). The onion rings were good and done to perfection. They don't seem handmade, but they have good flavor. And the portion seemed correct. The steak had A LOT of gristle and was pretty inedible. What an absolute bummer! I was literally chewing on a piece for minutes, then realized that it was not jerky and shouldn't be that tough. The steak sandwich lowers my score here- as does the 'smoke room' attached to the restaurant. Not sure what that room is, but it was a solid white plume of smoke for most of our stay. I could see people walking in/out, but you couldn't see them once they entered (it was that smoky). I know it was humid that day, but that's kinda crazy. Even for me..."}
{"text":"I have gone here off and on for a year and a half. It's everything you'd expect in a small Wisconsin bar. Cheap drinks, good grill food, friendly service, pool table, darts and a jukebox. It's not fancy but it's fantastic all the same. I really like the Friday fish fry. Final note: they don't have a lot of craft beer but they have enough."}
{"text":"It should tell you how amazing everything here is by the fact that there is a party of at least 25 here, and we were willing to stick it out for the food.

The food is pretty astounding. Great onion rings, good cheese curds, and a ridiculous amount of bacon on my bacon cheeseburger. There had to have been 6 pieces on it, and they were that perfect level of crispy. 

Price is really good for the amount of food you get, and the quality of it. 

The one downside, is that there is a small room off to the side where people go to smoke. It's opening and closing pretty much always, so that kind of ruins part of the food experience. The smell of cigarette isn't overwhelming, but it's not great either."}
{"text":"Great local tavern. Staff is quick and super friendly. Bar food is excellent with decent prices. Stiff cocktails and cold beer. Merica"}
{"text":"This place is one of the few things I actually miss about living in Fitchburg. 

The BF and I used to come here on a pretty frequent basis. They have really good food, so we often would order by phone and just go pick up a to-go order without stopping for a drink. Or, pop in for an order and have a drink while it's being prepared :) 

Service was always good. The bar is kept up pretty well, usually nice and clean. The outdoor patio area is really nice. There are 3 restrooms total, one for men, one for women, and one that is neutral. Always use the neutral one as it is much larger and nicer than the other two! There's also a sliding glass door that leads to a smoking room for those who don't want to go all the way outside for a cigarette. As others have mentioned, this does allow smoke to seep in to the bar which kind of stinks (literally), but it is a great convenience for the smoking crowd. 

Go check this place out!"}
