{"text":"I love love love this place!!! Delicious food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices! My favorite is Hot Lover. Spicy rolls are good and nigiri sushi are also very good!!  Only negative thing I can think is that their food is on the salty side. But servers are very good at refilling water ;)  I will def. go back (hopefully soon.)"}
{"text":"Bulgogi is top notch. Beef marinade is delicious, wash it down with a Sapporo and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was relatively tasteless, some was served cold, some overcooked so it was tough. I won't be back."}
{"text":"sushi was okay   bibimbab was the worst bibimbab i had   if you are looking for some casual sushi it would be okay  but definitely not the korean place"}
{"text":"Food was good, but if you are going to a show, get there early.  90 minutes was barely enough.  The kind waitress apologized.  I understand it is hard to staff for a theater crowd."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. I'm not a huge sushi fan, so I ordered the Bibimbap, which I would definitely recommend to people who aren't crazy for sushi, but is going out with someone who is. I thought it was very good and was surprised at how cheap it was when I got the bill."}
{"text":"The teriyaki steak was tough and the mashed potatoes were served cold. Shusi is so so. Location and sake' get the best marks here."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place that's reasonably priced. Enjoyed a yum yum roll and dumplings. Except that the later should have been steamed and not deep fried the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Eh.  I wasn't that impressed.  Went the first week it opened and the food was mediocre at best.   Figured I'd let them settle in and tried it for lunch last week.   Still not much better.    There's something missing here and I can't put my finger on it.     The service is a bit overly attentive - for example, we were seated, given menus and then - literally - 30 seconds later the young server came to take our order.   We asked for a few minutes to open our menus, ordered some sodas and then started looking.     As we were READING the menu and 1 minute later ... Back she was with our drinks and ready to take our order.  A total of -maybe- three minutes had passed since we entered the place.  Server seemed completely thrown and perplexed that we weren't ready to order.  She was a sweet young girl, but didn't quite get the timing.  I appreciate that folks want to zoom in/out at lunch and its better than peering into the horizon looking for a server, but ... Really?  Best of luck Sung.   Looks like you've got some fans and that's great.  I'm just not one of them."}
{"text":"Their sushis are good! It's convenient!  Grateful it opened here! Good Bulgogi! ...but like, nothing special."}
{"text":"Very poor and slow service at lunch time. Chicken Teriyaki was, um, interesting. Not inexpensive for the quality. Take out for lunch is hit or miss: sometimes the Alaskan rolls are good, and sometimes there's more fat and skin than salmon."}
{"text":"ah, theater district. i did not know you existed when i parked a mile away from progressive stadium for the indians/rays wild card game. you can't blame me - i was just passing through. and i thought i was so smart, getting there in time to eat a healthier meal than hot dogs and pierogies. but the theater crowd beat me to it.  we were seated, in our chief wahoo gear, surrounded by couples dressed for a fancy night of culture (i know cleveland is a real city but it was so cute! like kids playing dress-up in their parent's old disco outfits). we were in it for the korean, but after getting the runaround from the waitress for ten minutes or so, we were able to nail her down to the situation: the kitchen could not BEGIN to handle any new orders for another half-hour. and once they started, no telling where our order would fall in that line.   we were early, but not that early. sushi, however, we were assured, could be prepared instantaneously. yet somehow, after that proclamation was made and we told the waitress we would need \"a minute\" to decide what to order, it took another ten minutes to get her attention again. i'm from the new york school of stare a hole through them until they acknowledge you and yell \"yo\" and wave when they look past you - i wasn't being a wallflower about it. she was downright ignoring us.   then we ordered and instantaneous equaled fifteen minutes. leaving us five minutes to shovel the food into our gullets before departing for a quickly-paced mile walk to our nosebleed seats, all of which left my stomach wishing i had done something easier on it, like pierogies and a hot dog.  for what it was worth, i think the sushi was ok. not great and certainly not worth the wait, but don't even hold me to it because i'm not sure i even chewed it before i swallowed."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this 5 stars, but the service was so bad that couldn't happen. My husband and I ordered 2 rolls and an appetizer on a Monday evening.  I cannot speak to the appetizer since the server never brought it. The rolls (that took 40 minutes to get and only after we tracked the server down) were delicious.  The sake was very good; I highly recommend the sake sampler. I wouldn't go here again before a show, but maybe if you don't have time constraints give it a try. After such bad service,  it is unlikely I will be back, but if you are in the mood for sushi and don't have somewhere you need to be right away,  give it a try!"}
{"text":"I wanted very much to like this restaurant. My family and I love Japanese food, and the location is perfect for a quick supper before a theater event. Our first impression was good -- clean, a nice, open space decorated with posters of major theater productions, not too crowded, and a sushi bar in the back.  We were greeted in a timely way, and our drinks came quickly, and then our appetizers also came in good time.  But the service really went downhill from there. 3 of the 4 of us were eating sushi. When our main orders came, one of the sushi orders had major errors. And one of the sushi orders just didn't come.  So we pointed out that it was missing, and were promised it would arrive soon.  Fifteen minutes later, it had still not arrived, and we asked again.  Then, the sushi chef put our order in the line to be made, but it still took 10 more minutes to arrive.  The rest of us were done with supper, and it was almost time to leave for our theater event Inexcusable!!!  No offer of any consideration for the lateness of the order.  Although the food & location are good, this is just terrible service."}
{"text":"Food and service always awesome here. We have been coming here since they opened. I love the chicken teriyaki and wakeme salad. Although we've always done lunch, I wouldn't hesitate dining for dinner."}
{"text":"Great sushi and shushimi  love the bimbibop    . Contemporary feel. Great location before a show."}
{"text":"Sung's house has really delicious sushi options. The staff is always friendly and attentive and will answer any questions that you may have.   I'm giving this 4/5 stars because, while I loved the sushi, the chicken teriyaki that I got for lunch was just kind of Meh. It was pretty underwhelming. The price here is very decent though and they have some nice lunch combinations to choose from!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!!!!  Great sushi for a wonderful price in Playhouse Square. Loved the California Roll and the husband had a chef's choice variety which was also fantastic.  Their miso soup was very good as well and drink prices are very reasonable.  We were only in town for one weekend and had two meals at this place!  Sounds like they might be busy on weekdays during lunch, but our  visits were on a Friday night and Saturday afternoon and were seated right away at the window."}
{"text":"Prime location but can also get busy when there are shows at the Playhouse. I've come here a come here a couple times and I've never been disappointed with the sushi. This time I was being basic/poor and ordered a Cali roll, and that never fails. Generally cheap for a roll depending on what it is. I'd definitely go for the edamame if you want a side because it's a huge bowl. My friends got miso soup but we all concurred the soy beans were the real champions."}
{"text":"Okay, three words to sum up my dining experiences here: edamame!  The ice cubes in my water were very cold, if i had to guess I'd say 15 degrees F. Good thing I don't have to guess. I dined with 2 different types of people which made it good for a balanced conversation. The only thing I have left to balance is my budget and my diet. Sung's allowed me to do both. They have a well priced lunch menu AND The menu provides for delicious, healthy options. I'm glad i ate here yesterday so now i can get McDonald's breakfast the rest of the week. Da da da dah, I'm liking it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at in Cleveland. Great atmosphere, quick service, and quality food. I occasionally stop in just for their Wakame (seaweed) salad. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried the boiled salmon dinner entree. Nice size portion cooked very well and served with assorted vegetables, miso soup, rice and a side salad. No brown rice is available, which was unfortunate given its availability at nearby Saigon, Teahouse, and Sushi 86.   FYI, They have the menu posted on Facebook along with pictures of some delicious looking sushi rolls. Staff is very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Good food. However, I've been there a number of time during the week and they were closed (even though there hours stated they'd be open). I keep going back but it seems like they are always closed when they are supposed to be open. Won't waist my time going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We ate here just before seeing Dirty Dancing last night.  The restaurant was busy but not packed.  We sat at the sushi bar and had very quick service.  I ordered bibimbap and my guest had sushi.  Both were great.  The vegetables were fresh and when combined with the rice, tofu, and egg in the stone bowl tasted good.  I added some Korean pepper paste and it was the best version of this dish I've had in a few years.  Bill for the 2 meals including a beer came to $40 with tax....not bad.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the greatest sushi rolls I have ever had! Had Charlie sth roll and liked it a lot!!! Great price compared to what you get!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times when I have extra money to spend. I enjoy the chicken bibimbap the most! So worth it! Had the snap peas as an appetizer (both fun and appetizing to enjoy while waiting on your meal; highly recommended!) The sushi is always great too! I've tried salmon sashimi once, wasn't for me though. The service is great; overall, this place is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This was a cute little place on Euclid ave, smack dab in the middle of the theater district.   We went to Sung's for dinner on a Friday night. We were expecting more of a fancy place, but this felt more like a good location to grab a quick workday lunch. (Not that it's a bad thing, of course)  We ordered sushi, three rolls: Sung's, Tiger and Caterpillar. All were tasty, but I wasn't too overwhelmed by the quality. Sure- the sushi was fresh enough, but it seemed very run of the mill, Americanized sushi.   To comment on the rolls specifically though- the caterpillar was our favorite; it had eel in the middle and was topped with avocado. Sung's roll was a bit too spicy for my taste, as it was topped with a healthy dollop of Sriracha and fresh jalepenos.  Finally the tiger roll, spicy tuna topped with salmon and avocado, was tasty because it also has tempura crunch inside! That totally made the roll, in my opinion.   I will say that our service was pretty good, and the waiter was attentive, although if the restaurant would have been busier, I think the one waiter would have been stretched thin."}
{"text":"This is a great place to catch a meal before the theater. It is a mixture of Japanese and Korean. The staff is kind and attentive. I've come here many many times. Have the Bibimbap or the sushi, always fresh! I have never been disappointed. If you are coming for the theater make sure to make a reservation since they fill up quickly!!"}
{"text":"Have only been once so far, for lunch, and ordered sushi and vegetable tempura.  Service was polite and snappy.  Portion sizes were good and very reasonably priced for sushi, I felt.  I absolutely plan on eating here for lunch again."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot because a client loves it but if it were up to me I'd never come back. Sushi is mediocre to bad and the hot food is mostly flavorless. The Chicken Katsu is a travesty, the worst I've had anywhere. Every time it's been way over cooked and under seasoned. Service is good but the food is a serious bummer."}
{"text":"Top-notch sushi here. Other menu items range from pretty good to excellent as well, but we've never been disappointed with the sushi. It seems to keep getting better. Reservations are essential on show nights, and service can get slow --- but it's always friendly. A great addition to the Playhouse Square scene, and so convenient for pre-theatre dining."}
{"text":"Had sushi takeout last night. Ordered the Yum Yum, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and spicy salmon rolls. It was my 4th time ordering from here. The fish is fresh and the flavor is competitive with sushi 86 down the road."}
{"text":"What a great place! I've been a regular, and they never disappoint!  The sushi is always fresh, and the bibimbap is especially good. Great service, and a decent beer and sake selection."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food is really really delish........will be back next time in Cleveland.    Great surprise"}
{"text":"Good sushi and great prices. I like getting a combo for lunch (2 rolls plus miso soup or salad). One of my favorite lunch spots. However, the servers and hosts tend to be really rude. I would rate it higher if service was better. They act annoyed that you're there. They also water down their soy sauce, which makes me really mad."}
{"text":"Tried this new place, conveniently located next to theaters in Playhouse Square. Went for dinner at 7pm on a Friday and we were one of two people in the restaurant. Quiet atmosphere and the sushi was good. Better than other places around downtown and very reasonably priced rolls. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.The service and the ambience were both lacking but this location is extremely convenient to have a meal before a play as it's located in the heart of Playhouse Square and also allows for access directly to the theater without walking outside.  I even enjoyed the simple avocado cucumber roll but I especially loved the Yum Yum roll it was fried and also the appetizer hot lover as it comes with tuna and jalapeños.  The service was slow at the restaurant and then I don't know if the kitchen was behind but we got a rolls after quite a while on Wednesday evening I don't know that this place is built to accommodate much of a crowd that being said when food arrives Its very enjoyable.  Its not the best sushi I've ever had and doesn't compare to other large cities but it was good. Next time I think I would let the waitress know immediately that I had to go to the show in about an hour and a half and perhaps the dining experience would have been less stressful."}
{"text":"The sushi was good. Service was nice. But it's not my favorite place for sushi. But it's my first time trying here. Not bad but I had better."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials. I had the chicken teriyaki today and you get so much wonderfully tasty food for $8."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I enjoyed the sushi at Sung's. I got the Alaskan, Vegi Fashion and my favorite of the night was something that was deep friend and spicy (but it is not on the website menu and I can't recall the name of it at the moment). I did not try it, but my boyfriend had the nigiri and said it didn't feel like it was fresh and felt kind of chewy. One thing that neither of us liked was the drink menu. Wish there was more and higher end options there.  I really liked the playhouse decor inside, but that half of the restaurant was a little too bright. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Sung's House a chance.  I came here on a Friday night around 730pm and it was empty except for us.  The restaurant itself is nice, modern looking, casual.   Let's start with service.  While the servers were very friendly and nice, our waiter couldn't answer simple questions about the menu.  He had to go ask other workers and come back.  They were also not very attentive.  We had to have someone go walk over to the servers to ask if we could order.  And we had to keep waving them down whenever we wanted refills on water or anything. (Reminder, the place was empty...) And when we got our bills, two of us were overcharged. Maybe the waiter was new, but they need to work on their service especially if it's not super crowded.  Food-wise, I thought it was decent.  Probably 3 stars for food.  It came out relatively quickly after we ordered. A bunch of us tried the sushi and some tried the korean food.  The korean food was ok, nothing special but decent.  The sushi roll I got was just okay, but everyone else thought the sushi was pretty good and decently priced."}
{"text":"Sung's House is an absolutely delicious addition to the Playhouse Square district! I ventured in here after work for dinner. The food is absolutely outstanding, and very reasonably priced which is a breathe of fresh air! I'm so happy to have found this gem. The staff are very polite and attentive. The decor is simple but the blend of colors I find very inviting and modern. They have posters of plays and theaters adorning one of the walls which is a nice touch.   I will definitely be going back several times and referring people to come here!"}
{"text":"I was coming to this place since 2015. I used to like this place a lot. Especially, they had a great lunch deals (they still do). However, couple last times, I was unhappy with he food quality. Three weeks ago, I ordered some lunch combo, and it didn't taste well- sushi wasn't just fresh (main products in sushi were not fresh).  I've thought that maybe it was one time mistake, so I came back after 10 days. This time, I ordered just one special roll...and again, I wasn't happy with the taste.  In general, the place is cool, the staff is nice but quality of food should improve (talking about sushi and raw products)."}
{"text":"Like most visitors to Sung's House, my family came here before a show. We were attending the Broadway Buzz, so we arrived earlier in the evening and were leaving just as the rush started. The service at the beginning was very attentive, but it definitely slowed as the restaurant filled! The food comes our very quickly, but that meant other basics had to wait--like my family waiting for its check.   Onto the tasty food! My mother had a seaweed salad and the seafood udon, which was brimming with seafood. Dad loved his bulgogi--the beef was incredibly tender and the sauce was delicious--and I finally had a chance to try bibimbop! The egg was wonderfully cooked and the stone bowl was very very hot. I loved it! I ordered tofu because I love tofu but haven't mastered it myself, but I was actually a bit disappointed in their tofu. It was kind of limp and felt like it was an afterthought. Next time I'll get the beef bibimbop.   My dad stuck with the regular salad, but for a few extra dollars I traded my salad for the cucumber salad. I loved the dressing!   Portions here are huge, so come hungry. And if you're coming during a rush time or before a show, give yourself some extra time!"}
{"text":"The rolls are so good! They have deep fried rolls. So good! I highly recommend. They're also big for only being $8 - a really great deal.   They also have great Korean bibimbap!l - even in the hot stone bowl (dolsot bibimbap). It's a super popular choice here- pretty much every table ordered one.  The location is right in the heart of Playhouse Square, so if you need a bite before a show- it's a perfect place to go.   The owner prepared all of the sushi for a packed room (all the tables were full!) and made the sushi super fast & pretty. We didn't wait long at all. He's also very kind and humble.   We also ordered ramen, sake, Kirin beer."}
{"text":"Sung's House has the most prime location ever. Tucked right next to Playhouse Square, Sung's House has inexpensive, high quality Korean food in generous portions. You honestly will not find a better bang for your buck then Sung's House. They're known locally for having the best Bibimbop, a veggie/rice/meat dish served in a hot stone bowl. If you're into sushi, try the Tempura Combo (pictured below).   They're open until 9pm, which is fantastic if you're in the theatre district area. If you're heading to a show at Playhouse Square, make sure you call ahead!  Tip 1: in general, always be certain you have extra time if you're grabbing a meal there. The staff is very professional, but they seem to be understaffed for how popular they are.   Tip 2: The entrance is currently under construction, so instead of entering through the front door, enter through the Bulkley Building at 1501 Euclid Avenue."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Miso soup with Korean dinner, average tasting food, charged for hot sauce, main course brought out in the middle of the salad.  This place belongs in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Thought I gave korean food a try in downtown Cleveland.  I really love korean food but this place left me feeling like I should have just not have eaten at all. The Bibimbab was dry and barely had any ingredients. The sauce that came with it tasted like tomato sauce with  hint of Siracha. Try another place if you want korean food."}
{"text":"i went to playhouse square, saturday, for the opera -- had about 20 minutes before the show, and i was hungry -- thought i'd go to starbuck's, for a little something -- on the indoor-corridor, i passed a sign for the restaurant -- stepped in -- menu on the counter -- saw bibimbop -- over the last few weeks, i've seen a couple of bibimbops in e-mails i've received, and they looked good,...intriguing -- asked a waiter how long it would take to prepare -- five minutes -- let's do it -- tofu  little bowl of miso soup and a small salad arrived first -- i was told they came with the bibimbop -- soup was good -- fairly hearty -- the salad was fresh and had that dressing that i love from the hibachi places  bibimbop was big and hot -- first time for me -- fresh -- added hot sauce a little soy -- good -- i'll go back, try it again -- give it the full experience -- savor it,...more  made it to the theater, while the director of the opera company was speaking  very good opera, too -- il trovatore"}
{"text":"Had the rare opportunity to come downtown for lunch, so I had to try this new Korean/Japanese place I'd been hearing about.  The menu offers a pretty arbitrary (and quite limited) smattering of Korean and Japanese selections - bi bim bop (stone bowl only), bulgogi, chicken katsu, a couple teriyaki selections, a couple of udon selections, one type of ramen, a couple of rolls.  We figured that since the owner was Korean that we should try some Korean food first (actually - they were out of the chicken katsu).    We ended up getting a bulgogi, a bi bim bop, and a dragon roll.  The bulgogi was marinated very well and came on a bed of bean sprouts and other veggies typical to japanese teppanyaki.  (Sadly, no grills at the tables here for you to cook the bulgogi yourself.)  It also came with two california rolls, which seemed out of place and made us scratch our heads a bit.  The bi bim bop was fairly typical and tasted decent, except it was piping hot and burnt quite a bit while we were waiting for the waitress to bring us a spoon.  The shrimp tempura within the dragon roll lacked crunch but the roll was flavored well and the eel was fresh.  Pretty decent for Cleveland Asian fare.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I Love This Place! The food is fresh and outstanding. The service is fast and friendly. I eat here at least four times a month and have never been dissatisfied"}
{"text":"It's rather pricey for sushi. And the sushi was just alright. The miso soup was pretty good though. I thought the service could of been a little better. The waitress was a little short and seemed kind of annoyed at whatever we wanted."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go before seeing a play. The sushi is insanely good - and make sure you pay attention to the specials because there are always winners on there. Tables are pretty close together which kind of sucks but the food and easy access to Playhouse Square makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Sushi restaurant in downtown Cleveland! The shrimp tempura lunch combo is my go to order every time. You get two different rolls of sushi for $8 and then I order a side of udon noodles with teriyaki sauce and it is absolutely delicious! The whole meal only comes out to be $10 and it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We were at Playhouse to see Wicked; we used the yelp app to find a place nearby that sounded good to dine at.  My friend is a vegetarian, so this place was perfect.  We both had miso soup and shared an order of edamame.  She opted for some noodle bowl filled with fragrant broth and fresh vegetables.  She really liked it.  I opted for salmon teriyaki and it was delicious.  We didn't order anything special to drink.  The place is small but nice, not pretentious, and the waitress was very nice and efficient.  You can easily eat here and be stuffed for $30/2 peeps.  They also had a nice Looking sushi/sashimi bar; tiny, but clean.  I was very surprised at how good the food is and how much I like this place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was nice.  The service was great and the food and sushi came out fast.  Everything was tasty and the price was not bad at all.  They have a decent selection and it's great for a quick bite downtown near csu or playhouse square.  The sushi was good but the roll I had had some small issues with it staying together other than that not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Ugh, what a letdown! I've been craving the Bibimbop all weekend and was planning on ordering it for lunch today but decided to go with the starter shrimp tempura instead. I was envisioning strips of tempura shrimp with veggies on the side but instead, everything was deep fried with the lightest coating and ONLY ONE PIECE OF SHRIMP!!!  Really?! I basically just had about 7-8 pieces of a variety of green bean, sweet potato, zucchini and raw onion (GROSS) deep fried with that lousy piece of flavorless shrimp.  It came with a dipping sauce which looked oil based with some chives in it that offered very little added flavor.    What makes it worse is that it cost $8! For $1 more I could have gotten the very plentiful and flavorful Bibimbop! Well now I know to only stick with that dish and never get this tempura again.  It really was a $5 appetizer, what a shame!"}
{"text":"I would go 3.5 if I could. Couldn't be more convenient location for pre-show meal. But it has more of a casual busy diner feel than fine dining so be ready for that. Best to make a reservation as well. We tried the hot lover and I don't get it. The base was very tough, was it fried nori? Idk, I'm thinking maybe it's just me that should get three stars. My rolls were fresh and good. My miso soup was technically miso broth (no tofu, etc.) and the service was friendly but I agree with past reviews in that they seemed understaffed. I do want to go back and try the Korean entrees, I was too busy sampling to pull the trigger on the bibimbop."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Eh, it's good, but nothing spectacular? For a place that claims to be a Korean/Japanese restaurant, I sure didn't see much Korean on their menu. It actually reminded me a lot of restaurant that I used to go to a lot in Ann Arbor (Sadako...but not as good as Sadako).  We stopped in here before our show at Playhouse Square. Service was good and attentive. We ordered a roll (it was okay, Ginko is better), he got the bebimbop (it's more like the dolsot bebimbop), and I got the chicken katsu.  The dishes came with what you would find normally in a Japanese restaurant- a salad and miso soup. It was alright. My chicken katsu..was plentiful, but I was hoping there was something with it...besides just chicken katsu and rice. :P  My boyfriend's bebimpbop...well, bebimbop, is just what it is- it's hard to mess that up! It was okay though.. it is what it is.  Would I go back? Yeah, I probably would. Would I have a craving for it.? Eh. Maybe if they added more Korean food items on their menu.   The place looks nice though, but food is mediocre-Asian standards. I think as business picks up though, it could be promising...?"}
{"text":"Ever since Bricco closed its doors a couple months ago, going to a show at Playhouse Square doesn't seem as special an occasion. With only a smattering of other restaurants within walking distance of the theaters (with the closest being wayyyy overpriced, arbitrarily pretentious and just underwhelming overall), there really hasn't been a great pre-show food option.   Enter Sung's Kitchen, which just opened about a week ago. My friend and I discovered this new place while we were in the area trying to get a drink before a Yelp event across the street.   First, the location is perfect! It is about 2 storefronts down from the main entrance of the theaters.   Second, and more importantly, the food was DELICIOUS! The menu includes both Korean (ie, bulgogi and bibimbap) and Japanese (ie, chicken katsu and teriyaki) cuisine, with delicious sushi as the main event. We tried the spicy scallop rolls, a spicy tuna wrapped in cucumber (compliments of the chef), and the Hot Lover Roll.   I wasn't wild about the spicy scallop roll; I guess I prefer the Americanized version with cooked scallops.  However, the Hot Lover was one of the best things I've ever tasted: a big pile of spicy tuna with more spicy mayo topped with sriracha, all on a little bed of crispy rice. YUM!   My friend (who, like me, is 50% Korean in ethnicity but 100% Korean gastronomically) and I also each ordered the Korean Ramen, which was basically Neoguri (a childhood fave) dressed up with eggs, scallions and other veggies, to make for a very comforting and substantial meal.   The prices were pretty on point and fair - our bill for too much sushi and two big bowls of noodles was just under $40, with lots of leftovers for lunch.   While they don't have their liquor license yet, the very sweet owner (?) said she expects they'll have it in about a month, in which time I fully suspect this will be the perfect spot for dinner and cocktails for theater-goers."}
{"text":"The food quality, speed of service, and prices of Sung's House make this an ideal lunch spot for PlayhouseSquare and other downtown workers. I've never had a bad experience here and I'm happy to take guests to Sung's House anytime. The sushi is fantastic, but try the Bulgogi - it's so flavorful!"}
{"text":"Eh! Not someplace I would recommend for Korean in Cleveland.   Sung's is a combo Korean and Sushi restaurant, which should tell you something about their food right off the bat.  I came in for lunch and ordered from the Korean side of the menu not the sushi. Which is I guess where I went wrong seeing as how most who like Sung's ordered the sushi.  Sungs is not in my top 5 choices for Korean in Cleveland. If you want good Korean head to Seoul Garden, Meiga, Seoul Hot Pot or even Korea House.  I went with a group from work and we all ordered something different. I ordered the yaki soba (bland!) and the others ordered chicken katsu (chicken was good, the sauce seemed off), bibimbap (okay) and 2 tempura sushi combos (good but small).   Overall this place was a complete miss for me.  I maybe might try it for sushi if friends were set on coming here otherwise I wouldn't make the trip."}
{"text":"I want to give some big propers to Sung's House! I made my first visit here yesterday evening for a quick snack before an event downtown and, to be honest, I wasn't expecting to be wow-ed. The unassuming storefront, the Playhouse Square locale, and the fact that they serve both Korean and Japanese cuisine, erroneously, made me think that I'd be in for some mediocre maki. Not the case!   My simple order of (1) vegetable and (1) eel roll really knocked my socks off. The sumeshi was head-and-shoulders about most sushi restaurants: perfectly cooked, well-seasoned (with just the right amount of tang from rice vinegar, which I find is too often absent), and lightly packed around the nori. Neither bland nor mushy - absolutely perfect!   I devoured my rolls with a smile and will be back to try more from the menu when I have more time to savor. If you're looking for a bite in Playhouse Square, I really recommend giving Sung's House a try."}

{"text":"I'm overdue on reviewing this place, since my last review was about 2 years ago when they first opened. I still stand by my former opinion- I personally come for the sushi, not the Korean because I'm pretty much steadfastly loyal to Seoul Garden in Parma for my Korean food, however, I come here at least twice a month for sushi, and I am never disappointed.   I always sit at the bar, for a few reasons.  One- I don't have to wait to be seated during a busy lunch. Two- I always get a friendly greeting from the sushi chefs when I sit down. Three- for some reason, it seems as if this place has an extremely high turnaround rate for their serving staff. Every time I come in here there are different servers, and they always seem to either be \"in training\" or just really, really confused. For those reasons, I sit at the bar, and I can get in and out during my short lunch hour really quickly.   By this time, I've probably tried most of the rolls on their menu, and I like all of them. Their best deal however, is probably their lunch combos (sold before 2pm). You get two different kind of rolls, and the price ranges between $8-$10. Most of the time, I leave having spent $10 or less on my sushi, which I think is a really great price for good sushi.   I'm happy to see this place has a busier lunch crowd now than they did when they first started, but it seems a lot of people I mention it to still don't know about it. For that reason, I go out of my way to recommend it to others as a weekday lunch spot, and I will continue to be a loyal customer as long as they offer sushi."}
