{"text":"Just left Crave right now in huge disappointment. . Chicken was super dry. Wait time was long but of course It is their 2nd day opening totally understanding. . 

To MANAGEMENT: 
Please teach your staff to be more professional. I was eating at the end of the bar. My wife ordered a roasted chicken and I ordered a sushi boat while I was eating by your well station you have servers and bartenders giving guest checks right next to my plate invading my personal place and i just couldn't enjoy my food. We have your long black hair bartenders giving out free drinks to these two guys. Gosh, mind as well give me some free drinks too while she and her friends talk over my shoulder! 

Advice to everyone: please give this restaurant some time to improve trust me. The food quality and service is not worth the price yet.. But we shall wait n see.."}
{"text":"So disappointed not because of the food mattar of a fact the food was great, but because of the poor treatment that we received from the manager. To my knowledge dogs are not allowed in restaurant unless is stated some where on there wall/door/ window, we were subjected to witness dog pissing next to our table while our food being served sat through the smell, and we mentioned that to the manager she said I can move you!!!! Really???? There was 9 of us the food is in front of us we were her first!!!! No apology nothing. I'm surprised and I had never experienced such a poor treatment from restaurant manager. Crave you disappointed me, never again ."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, casual, well appointed. Service was fine. Hostesses very nice. Food was ordinary. Out of 5 in our party, four would not return.  The fifth had left so didn't weigh in!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop in Downtown Summerlin. The food and ambience was phenomenal. Had the Lemon garlic wings. Came out piping hot and delicious. The happy hour specials were a great deal too. Will come back"}
{"text":"Decided to give this new restaurant a try since this was just a few of the restaurants that were actually open for the grand openining of Downtown Summerlin. Sorry to say that my boyfriend and I were not impressed. The quality of food was something I would expect from Applebee's but with a 75% mark up in their prices. 

We started off with the Aloha roll and the Pork Belly Sliders. The roll it wasn't anything special but for $15 I was expecting more and the sliders came on some hawaiian roll bread, it was just ok. My boyfriend ordered a their signature Crave burger, the meat patty was a bit dry and the fries were soggy. I ordered turkey BLT and I got somewhat of a flat bread sandwich, kind of threw me off. The smell of the bread was too dough-y, wasn't very pleasant.

In conclusion, we left dissapointed and unsatisfied. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A must have when visiting Downtown Summerlin. 

Crave offers a variety of food ranging from pizza to sushi - and each dish I've tried has been exceptionally crafted. The restaurant is lively but quiet enough to have a work lunch and also serve as a good date spot. 

The bar offers a decent selection of drinks and TVs for watching sports. 

I'd definitely recommend the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Normally when we frequent Crave, which is about 3-4 times a month, we are very happy. Food is good, service is good, all around very nice. However, today we went and ordered ice-t and the waiter informed us the machine was broken so we could not have ice-t which was fine. We then ordered bottled water and he then informed is that they were out of bottled water as well! How disappointing !!!!!! We left and went to CPK next door. 


Went back to Crave after a less than stellar performance the last time and they got it all right! Everything was amazing! We had sashimi and it was spot on! There are two Maggie's that work there. Both are servers and both are very very good at their jobs! Thank you Crave for making tonight's visit what we are accustomed to!"}
{"text":"After reading all the bad reviews, I was hesitent about eating at this new Summerlin Restaurant. They have got the bugs out and it was a very nice experience. Deanne the Hostess was lovely, friendly and helpful in telling us about the place and the menu items. Craig, our server was very helpful, attentive and couldn't have been nicer. Tea glasses were filled before completely empty. Food was very tasty and presented very well. Prices are not really bad. They are keeping with area. Portions are large, we shared a Bison Burger and a house salad. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone and after a few trips of trying different things I have yet to be disappointed.  They even have vegetarian sushi, which my wife is a big fan of."}
{"text":"My cup of fish chowder was weird. There were little bits of stuff that seemed like chopped bits of meat, no idea what kind of fish. It was a flop. My Margherita flatbread was excellent. My wife's beef Stroganoff was ok. I was put off by the high wine prices and the lack of prices for beer and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I had to get my own refill at the bar......our plates weren't removed till about 15 minutes after we finished our apps.  The restaurant was nearly empty ( now I know why) the food was okay. The bison burger was excellent  but the sushi was bland with no flavor. I've worked as a food server in the past and I would not recommend this place for lunch nor dinner. The service was terrible. This was our first time here and it did not impress. ..... Good thing there are more options to eat around summerlin mall..."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now, and the food has been fantastic both times.  That said, we were even more impressed with the service.  The first time we were here, the waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, which always makes ordering much easier.  The second time we came because we received an email about a four course meal being offered 26-31 December.  We came on the 26th with the intention of having the four course meal, but as it turned out, this location was not prepared to offer the four course meal until the 31st.  We were bummed, but stayed anyway and had a great meal which was comped by the manager Jamie.  Excellent service all around!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here 3 weeks ago. Service was great and the meals were very good. I made a reservation last week for 5 of us. The hostess asked if this was a special occasion, I told her yes. Our daughter was coming in from New York to celebrate her 30th birthday. 

We arrived on time and we we sat within 5 minutes. Four of us were served our meals, unfortunately we had to wait 10 minutes for our last meal. One of our party ordered the Bison burger medium rare. It was well done. 

I understand that things happen, but why ask if it is a special occasion, and then do nothing but bring the check. Disappointing.

Oh well."}
{"text":"Made a 4pm reservation for the three of us including my 6 year old son. Still waited 20 minutes to be seated. Ordered an appetizer and they forgot to bring it out. Food was mediocre at best. Spent 90$ for what! I would never return to this place again. Don't know what all the rave was about Crave."}
{"text":"went with family for lunch had the bison burger and was very good french fries were ok a little soggy had the bread basket and was very good for appetizer all in all would go back and hostess was very friendly."}
{"text":"I visited Crave for the first time tonight, and I have to say that it was a wonderful experience. The service and promptness was impeccable. Hayley was our waitress and she did a fantastic job, always making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Atmosphere, Great Service.  

There was a slight wait, but it was worth it.  Joelle took great care to ensure questions were answered, and she made great suggestions.  She is the service professional everyone hopes for on a nice evening out.  

The menu is varied and includes a wide range of house-made dishes.  Try the hummus (I forget the menu word for it).  They also have very tasty sushi options. 

do it!"}
{"text":"Saw \"Logan\" at Regal 5 Cinemas on Sunday.  Stopped by Crave with the lady afterwards.

It was our first time going to Crave and we knew they had all day happy hour for drinks on Sunday.

We didn't know it was all day happy hour for food on Sunday.

Soooooooooo...

We get to our table and our server doesn't tell us about happy hour, at all.

So I go ahead and order a $12 appetizer not knowing they have $4 / $5 / $6 appetizers and trust me I would have easily gotten the $12 worth - or more - and the server would still have gotten the same tip.

We had to ask for the happy hour drink menu.  Fail.

I ordered a Blue Moon, they brought a Miller Lite.  Fail.

The lady ordered a Passion-something drink of Crave's which is New Amsterdam and something.  They bring a red mint julep looking drink that was wrong.  Fail.

We watched our appetizer (which was good) float around the lobby an extra lap when it wasn't busy at all.  We were planning on dinner but we settled up and left.  

$25 for two drinks and one appetizer with four eggrolls.  

Yes, I tipped the waitress $2 on a $23 bill.

We'd try their happy hour again, but we'll sit at the bar and see if they have their $hit together."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would.  It has a nice setting and appearance, but it is all looks. Our waitress was very nice and helpful but everyone else, especially the managers were soooo lazy. They would walk by past my empty water and look at the table and keep on trucking. My Bison Burger was not good and the fries were more than soggy. The Mexican Roll was pretty gross and tasted old. Everyone at the table was served at different times so we could not all eat without waiting for one another. Plus it took over an hour to get our food. Their service overall was bad and their food was even worse. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."}
{"text":"I went with my family for mothers day and it was a disaster from the minute we sat down.  We had three adults and two children 3 & 4.  My daughter immediately ordered food for the kids (fruit sushi rolls and donut holes) and it took at least 45 minutes to get them.  FYI we arrived at the restaurant at 10 a.m. and there were only two other parties there at that time.  Our drink order was taken and again at least 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  NOT ONCE during the entire meal were we offered coffee refills or other beverage refills.  One of the party ordered an omelette, salmon, chicken brio cheese sandwich and the kids pancakes with chocolate chips.  The wrong omelette was served and it appeared to have been made with one egg, cold.  The right omelette finally appeared 20 minutes later - 1 egg, toast, no butter, no jelly and ice cold.  Pancakes arrived after the adults had their food and no chocolate chips.  The service, the food was awful.  I don't know what is going on with this restaurant but they clearly need a lesson in prep, cooking and serving.  It was suppose to be a relaxing mothers day brunch which turned into a stressed out experience.  The manager was sympathetic and told us \"good help is hard to find\".  He did reduce the bill and gave us a gift card.  We met friends at another table and the same situation applied to them as well.  Too bad this restaurant use to be good.  With all the competition in Downtown Summerlin they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Dining review: CRAVE Downtown Summerlin

Food was ok. Service....SUCKED. It was only 3pm and not busy. Waited approx 10 minutes to get seated basically since they were waiting for the new shift of staff to come in. Waited at our table for another 15-20 minutes for a server to arrive. We had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we did drink and food order at the same time. Drinks arrived (we only ordered water and never were given refills)....then waited well over 30 minutes for just a turkey burger and chicken stir fry to show up. We saw our server only 3 times in the hour we were there and had to almost tackle him to pay attention to us to get our tab. Manager walked around a lot and was on his cell. Not a good view when people are waiting for food or have that look like they need assistance but no one is showing up. We weren't the only table that seemed to be forgotten. Staffing needs some work and management could step up and help out more as well in my opinion. We probably won't be going back.
Turkey burger was average and the chicken in the chicken stir fry was thinly sliced like it could of been used in a chicken sandwich or BLT style sandwich."}
{"text":"OMG, It was outdtandong. We sat outside for lunch  everyone treated us so special  the waiter went out of his way to please us. The food was absolutely  great. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of Crave but as a girlfriend and I were already at Downtown Summerlin to see a movie, we decided to go there for happy hour and a quick bite to eat. Our server Nicholas was a real joy. His suggestions for food were excellent and there's no doubt that his service is the reason we'll go back. We tried a couple of flatbreads and the honey sriracha wings. It was a perfect portion for the two of us. We had some happy hour cocktails, that went down a treat. The atmosphere was lovely, it had a pretty trendy feel to it, and was really spacious. All in all we had a great time and would recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"The food here is good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd definitely say that everything is a little bit overpriced. However, the staff is friendly and my friends & I had a good experience. I don't think I'll be 'craving' to eat here again but definitely wouldn't mind trying it out again."}
{"text":"Place was a joke salad wilted pizza cold and soggy tempura carrots cold and soggy really bad food all the way around.I asked for a glass of water the waiter dropped it off in a hurry.When he came back I asked for a straw he said they don't give straws with water unless you request so he would have to go get one really bad! So many things wrong with this place.60.00$ for lunch for me and my wife and 6year old grandson no alcohol.Will never go back"}
{"text":"Crave in Downtown Summerlin. -awesome service, great ambiance and superb menu selections.  The salmon salad was the best I have ever had.  Jessica you rock!"}
{"text":"I seriously created an account just to rate this bad restaurant. The service was horrible. Empty drinks for 20 minutes, no silverware, every time we asked a question to our waitress (not sure her name but she was a bigger black lady) she said \"hold on let me check\" and one question was about the price on the drinks since there are no prices listed. Ridiculous! Very bad first impression and I will not be going there again. I was so mad I really just started to ignore the waitress because she was quite useless."}
{"text":"Loved it Super awesome Yellowfin Tuna and Hamachi"}
{"text":"The family and I decided to check out this new restaurant because there seemed to be a lot of buzz around it. We stopped by for a late afternoon bite and walked into a crowded entry. The place just opened, why wouldn't it be packed in here! However, that was not the case, there were 4 tables and 2 couch areas opened on the outside patio and the bar area had only a handful of patrons. There were 3 women at the hostess podium who were engaged in their own conversation. It looked like they were trying to figure what they were going to do. There was no friendly greeting nor did they even acknowledge our existence. One walked away, another when to seat the group in front of us, the blonde in the white shirt (I'm assuming she was management since everyone else was in all black) continued to ignore us and stare at her laptop even as I walked up to her. Another girl came by and greeted us, I asked if we could be seated outside. She commented that we can but she's not sure if there were any open tables as she hesitantly went to go check. My Husband commented that there were open tables, she returned a minute later and directed us to the patio. 

Our server was friendly, however service was bad. It took a while for him to greet us, take our drink order, take our food order, and our food took 40 mins. If the food was good, the wait time could easily be overlooked. The food is MEDIOCRE AT BEST! Seriously, we travel a lot, we eat out a lot and we love trying new places, nor are we snooty food critics. We simply enjoy dining out and appreciate getting what we pay for.

The menu is all over the place so I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted. There's sushi, burgers, pasta, salads, etc. There's no rhyme or reason for the menu. I ordered a salad and added a grilled chicken breast, my husband got the crave burger and our daughter got the baked mac n cheese. Yeah, we settled for this because nothing else seemed appetizing and as much as we love sushi I'm glad we didn't order from here. 

Again, the food was mediocre at best you can go elsewhere to get better food. The icing on the cake however was that THEY RAN OUT OF BEER! The server was kind enough to tell my husband that there was a possibility that they were out of Stella and make a 2nd choice just in case. The server ended up coming back because they were also out of his 2nd choice which was Miller Lite. Are you kidding me?? OH and did I mention, I also ordered a cocktail, some dragon drink. I don't remember the name of it nor can I comment on it because I NEVER GOT MY DRINK! I get it they just opened up, but you ran out of at least 2 types of beer at 4pm?

There's not too many restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin yet, until then go to the Red Rock Casino and enjoy better food and over 150 beers on tap at the Yard House!"}
{"text":"No wait on a Friday night... Noise level is loud.  Sushi was ok had the Hamachi, Salmon and Rainbow roll.  Soy Sauce was very salty (more than most).  My daughter had the Bison Burger w/ Fries.  Said it was good but not great.  My son had the chicken and veggies off the kids menu.  Chicken was very dry and the broccoli was hard as a rock.  Prices were fair but I have to say I was not impressed.  Our server was very nice and on top of drink refills.  I guess I was expecting more and it was just average..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Roasted Chicken, and it was unappetizing. The sauce was too sour or bitter. It had a hint of BBQ and soy sauce. The taste was just weird. The taste was confusing. The fried plantain tasted like soap. I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a pleasant dining experience this is not the place to go. Was greeted with nothing, but attitude when we walked in the door from the hostess. We asked for a booth and were told they had to clean one. We said no problem we would wait. 10 minutes later we still had no booth. I asked the hostess what the delay was and she tells me sorry they are waiting for people to get up foe desert and it may be 15 more minutes. I told her the table was empty. She responds with, sorry someone else took that table and there is nothing she could do about it. I said can't you ask them to get up? Needless to say that wasn't happening either. Then I asked to speak to the manager and she did nothing to help either so we left and definitely won't be back. There are a lot of great options in the area. Don't waste your time or money here. Your business will not be appreciated."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We sat out on the patio which was interesting on a side note as all the booths were filled and they weren't seating in general at the tables in the center due to having to sit in direct sunlight, but we noticed that they had umbrellas so we asked to be seated at a table and had a umbrella moved to give us some shade. It took about 10 - 15 minutes before a wait staffer came to ask for our drink order, so as we waited we noticed a table of 3 women who order the hamburgers which looked really good, but what caught our attention was that all 3 of them ate their burgers with a knife and fork. It took another 10 -15 minutes before our drinks came and the waiter informed us that he was actually not the waiter assigned to our table and that our assigned waiter would come shortly to take our orders. It took another 10 mins before we saw our new waiter, so in the meantime we watched as a family of 3 insisted on being seated in a booth near us where the sun was shining directly at the table. The woman was pushing a stroller and we saw that there was a small dog inside, not a baby. When our waiter finally appeared to take our order we chose a starter of the Walleye cakes and then for entrees I ordered the Mexican sushi roll which was the only roll on their menu that had any hot spice to it, my partner ordered the Kogi tacos. As we now waited for our food, I noticed the lady at the booth looking distressed and covering her head with a magazine to block out the sun, she was frantically looking around for something. Her husband and son looked peaceful and were chatting quietly over the menu, the little dog in the stroller was soaking up the sunshine, finally the lady waved down a waiter and much to my surprise, asked him if he would move the umbrella that was at OUR table over to hers. Seriously?! Wow... The waiter looked confused and said that he couldn't do that as it was in use at OUR table. Ok, moving on now to the review on our food. The Walleye cakes were interesting but not enough to ever order again and personally felt they were overpriced at $ 13.95, they were just 3 little patties of wild rice and red onion with a tarter dipping sauce. My partner's kogi beef tacos were good with a nice flavor but a bit too sweet for my taste. My Mexican sushi roll was just eh....nothing memorable or different from any other standard roll. Overall, we spent almost 2 hours there with 3/4 of it waiting for service and food, if not for the side notes of \"people watching\" it would not be a memorable experience at all."}
{"text":"I tried this place fir the first time for a late dinner. I thought the menu had a nice variety and the food was pretty good. If you can score a discount coupon it is a great deal. Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I really can't say this place deserves one star.  We are visiting our son and he was taking us out to eat and chose this place.  I suppose the food was good but finally after over an hour we still didn't have any food even though our server said it would just be a few minutes about four times, even saying they would take 20% off our check, which really equates to a tip they wouldn't have received and didn't deserve anyway. They seem to cater to the bar group.  There really weren't that many people in the place.
The menu is way too extensive to begin with.
By the way if this place makes another year I'll be very surprised."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal with 7 of my girlfriends! Our server Casi was outstanding! Her knowledge of the menu was great, but her ability to know how to serve us without over doing it was refreshing! She is friendly & a real pleasure! I loved the Bison burger, but everyone at our table was very happy with their food. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are only for our server! He was great! We were a loud party of 12! The food was not good at all. So bland and such small portions! I had been there for lunch and didn't eat my food at all, it was just not good but a friend wanted to have his b day brunch there. The breakfast had no flavor and it wAs so small, we were hungry after we ate so we ordered donuts, and they tasted like empty calories. However the bottomless mimosas are great and only 11 bucks!"}
{"text":"Walked in today looking for a place that has happy hour. We were greeted by a rude young Asian lady wearing a skimpy dress who seemed like she didn't want to be there. She gave us attitude and seated us in an area that does not have a server! We waited for about 15 mins and decided to walk out. Place looks fancy, service absolutely sucks."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hour on a Friday and was surprised at how empty it was.  I ordered the Vegas Roll and my husband had the mac and cheese with chicken as recommended by our waiter.  Both our meals were amazing!  The service was awesome as well.  We asked our server if they offered a military discount and he stated they did but later discovered they actually didn't.  He then gave us a discount that he picked up.  The only complaint I have is that when we were seated the hostess' dress was so short she was literally holding it down as she walked us to out table."}
{"text":"We normally come here and are usually happy with the service. Tonight our bartender was busy so we asked William if we could get ramekins and soy sauce for our sushi. He said yes. William had the GALL to sit next to us with his friends, drink a shot and never told our bartender that we needed the ramekins and soy sauce or get them for us. William represents CRAVE, he was still wearing his CRAVE uniform when he sat down with his VIP friends and drank that shot. Apparently it doesn't count if you regularly go to CRAVE, only if you're friends of William does it matter. I hope William's friends come as often as we did. Or maybe we should befriend William, I think NOT!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing sushi! Alfred at the Sushi Bar is exceptional! Sushi was so fresh, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the Lobster and Shrimp flatbread. Decent. I advise coming here at night because the day time its pretty gloomy and feels like night anyway and no one spoke to me as if I didn't exist. Maybe will try again but first will try more restaurants in this mall"}
{"text":"First time with my wife. Had happy hour and the Sushi and Kogi Beef Taco are wonderful. Great greeting at the door and wait staff was great. Being they are new they have a lot in training and they all seem very attentive  and professional. Beautiful Resturant.  We will be back. 5 stats guus. Keep up the great job. Will be back for my birthday on the 20th. Looking for a full dinner. Will post how that goes."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday with my daughter. We were seated and they only brought us two waters. They brought us another water and took our order. I asked for the dressing on the side for my salad and when it came the dressing was drizzled on the salad. The food is pretty pricey and the fish is not fresh. My daughter had the California roll and it was $9 for 6 little pieces. The imitation crab was dry and the roll did not hold together. Our bill came out to be $100 with some other things. But other than that the server was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"30 minutes to get drinks, (beer for me, and lemonade for kids).  This was very disorganized situation understandably being the opening day of downtown summerlin.  The food was above average actually so they get 2 stars when you factor in 30 minutes to get the first drinks, and almost 1.5 hours for food to arrive.  The complete disorganized situation negates the desire to return here."}
{"text":"All of the staff was very cold and unfriendly from the hostess to the server.  You do not feel welcome at all and almost like you being there is putting them out.

We asked to sit outside, but they only had tables in the sun.  We took the sunny table but after about 20 minutes it was just too hot.  We saw the hostess setting up more tables outside in the shade and asked if we could move.  She just said no she was setting these up for another party but did not offer to move us inside or elsewhere.  A couple minutes later her, and who I think was the manager, were setting up chairs for the tables and we we asked if we could just move inside then.  We were told yeah give us a minute.  So they proceeded to both push in chairs and get everything ready for the guests who hadn't arrived yet instead of relocating the guests who were already there and sweltering in the sun.  It seems like one of them could have handled pushing in the chairs and the other could have re-seated us.  

Once we were eventually moved and received our food nobody ever came by to check on us or refill our drinks, which were both empty.  After we had finished eating and our drinks were still empty the server finally came around, but by that point we were just ready to go.

I can deal with bad service if the food is good, but that was not the case.  I ordered a flatbread pizza and it barely had any cheese on it.  Maybe 40% was covered in cheese.  Most of my bites were just the flatbread with tomato sauce.  All of the entrees were way overpriced too.

The whole vibe in this restaurant was just bad.  We couldn't wait to get out of there.  I will not be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"The food is okay, I wished it was better.  I really like the concept and decor., but I wished the food was more on par with the pricing.  With a name like Crave, the food should be so good, that you crave it."}
{"text":"We just went to crave for lunch.  We were given a high top, which we asked politely if we could change, to no avail.  We felt like we were annexed to a time out seat!  The hamburger was rare, when I had ordered med well.  My husband ordered a noodle chicken stir fry, which looked and tasted as if it came out of a can!  Inedible!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"30 min wait for seating.
1 hour for bread on table. 15 more mins for food.

\"Aint nobody got time for that\"


The place is a mess right now. Not just us but multiple tables with the hand on face bored looks and wtf is going on faces.

I know it's new but come on. I have been to new places that aren't this messed up.

Hold off on this place for a few months and see if they get their act together.

The food seemed OK but not THAT good."}
{"text":"The bimbimbap is special and tasty. I like it. It mixed some thai food element. Especially i am surprised to taste coconut rice."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal was had by all. Jacob was a wonderful server. Extremely attentive given how insanely busy this new restaurant is. It was difficult to b pick just a few dishes. Everything on the menu looked great. The Chicken Sausage flatbread is not to be missed. The Sliders, both pork belly and sirloin, were great. The sushi was good, but order early as there was a considerable wait from the sushi counter. The kids devoured the chicken fingers, mac n cheese, and s'more brownie. It's a new restaurant, folks, wait a couple months before posting your negativity."}
{"text":"The flatbread pizzas were delicious.   A few unique flavor options which was nice.  I had the asian chicken salad.  Very large portion...wasnt able to finish it all.  It was good, not the very best I've had, but still good.  A wide selection of food on the menu.  I will be back to try other items.  Modern and clean place."}
{"text":"Great locations as few restaurants are open at downtown Summerlin. Nice busy bar vibe but that carries into the restaurant and it becomes noisy.  The menu is very limiting unless you are there for sushi but it you really wanted sushi wouldn't you go to a dedicated sushi restaurant for added freshness. 

I ordered the lamb meatballs which was a special and sounded great, and luckily the waitress told me that many patrons had said how spicy it was. I ended up with the Asian salad.  Nothing special.  If you want bread its $1.95 for a basket that comes with soggy crisps, two small pieces of just ok foccacia and pita bread.  

Grand total bill was over $65 for a salad, two drinks...one so bad I could not drink it, and a pasta dish that I could have made at home 

The waitress was adorable and the design nice so maybe after they close someone can make something more out of the space. 

I won't be back"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times. It is a great spot for relaxing after shopping in Downtown Summerlin. The service is always great and they have a variety of food, including sushi!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here three times now.  Tonight we had Mahi-mahi again.  This time the Mahi-mahi was not prepared correct.  The rice and sauce was flat. Disappointed  with tonight's fish."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had an amazing time! The food was good and so were the drink. The best part of our experience here was our server, Bryan. He was very attentive and sweet from start to finish. He would constantly round to make sure we did not need anything and had a smile every time.  Definitely check this place out and request him. We came Saturday night and also got love music and the dj was spinning great songs!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place can't make 4 stars... Just pay attention and you'll see why.  Found a large long hair on my 702 burger... And the greens on the burger were awful... Yellow with rotten tips.  Didn't look like the chef was even trying to hide the zero quality of the arugula.  I wouldn't call the cook a chef to be honest.  

I wasn't offered any real apology, a free dessert or anything, still had to pay full price for everything and the replacement dish.  

When I found the hair, it took 5 minutes and I had to get out of my seat for me to get someone's attention, still had to wait after getting up when finally a manager noticed after a second pass.  It wasn't busy, the service was just poor, neglectful, just sad... The burger was returned and I ordered something else because I didn't trust a cook who served spoiled arugula (that should have been thrown away awhile ago) to not try and recycle some parts of the burger I sent back.  

Water was empty 3 times and had to wait 3 times.  

People need to remember, these low star reviews are just showing what people see.  It's always worse than how it looks.  The only reason I went here was because I had stubborn company.  I would guess that the idiot owners have a lot of money and take for granted that this place is in downtown summerlin and resting on the value of the location, so they don't seem to actually care about the quality of the food or service.  

An infant in a high chair was playing with their paper menu, it fell on the floor and a hostess walked right by it without picking it up.  This table was not situated in a way where I could believe anyone sober could actually not notice it.  The parents didn't see because of how the infant was positioned around the table.  The manager walked by, noticed, and picked it up and put it back on the table.  The infant picked it up and dropped it again.  Things that fall on the floor don't belong on a table... Especially in a restaurant, especially in front of babies that put their hands in their mouth.  In the food industry, there is absolutely nothing, in any circumstance ever, where the right thing to do when something falls on the floor, is to pick it up and put it back where it fell from.  

Whoever owns this place definitely did not deserve the money they thoughtlessly threw into this place.  

This is my 3rd or 4th Yelp review... Maybe only second... Because I only dump on places that actually deserve to be called trash.  This is not an isolated bad experience, a bad apple... This is pretty foundational.  The staff doesn't need a pep talk or a little staff meeting, it needs an episode on Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"It's truly a hit or miss.  I've been to CRAVE 4 times now.  I went there yesterday around 2 pm.  There were no more than 4 tables and 2 servers, yet the service was poor.  I asked for items and did not get them.  Our server never asked us if we needed anything.  On top of that, the kitchen was incredibly slow.  I ordered the premium bento box.  The dynamite roll was mediocre.   Best part was the fresh fruit... the funniest part of my experience was when we complained to the manager, while he gave us our check, and I noticed that my table was charged an extra plate!!  Thankfully the manager gave us a discount.  It's really the least he could do. Management really needs to improve their system and service.  It's not worth your money or time due to the inconsistency."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was upscale but relaxing. We sat outdoors with our 14 month old son. He ran around the patio(we were the only ones out there) and the staff were so kind and interactive with him. The bison burger was AMAZING! Tip: order the bison medium/rare. It's a very lean meat so the rare meat juices mixed with the egg yolk was to die for. We will definitely be back here to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"After seeing a lot of the negative reviews my friend and I decided anyways to check it out since the menu seemed pretty tasty. Upon finishing our lunch here I'd have to say I don't know what people are talking about in terms of bad service. My water was constantly refilled and my server was super nice and checked back multiple times during our meal to see if we were doing ok. Great feel to the place. Would definitely come back again. I had the Bison burger which was amazing and also the sliders to start. Also amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the butterscotch pudding for dessert slough it was risky probably to order it anyway but the texture was a little strange and it was too much. But that might just be the butterscotch flavoring. I dunno but other than that great experience. Will come again for sure one day."}
{"text":"Just order simply grill steak with medallions option didn't like it because the medallions ONLY 3!!! With some potatoes and rainbow califlower and honestly too expensive for such 3 little pieces of meat....for having meat in your dinner menu it should be at least good pieces of neat for the value $$$$ so sorry"}
{"text":"Had some great sushi today at Crave . Gary did awesome job. Had special desert chocolate treat to finish our experience at Crave. Nice place to start your day off right."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8. Took 25 minutes to just get our drink orders. 6 out of 8 orders were incorrect. I ordered the steak medium and it came out well done and the appetizer soup came out after my steak???

The waitress was very nice but you could tell the the mess the kitchen was in was taking its toll on her and her customers.

It almost felt that there was too many staff working Friday night and they would just form these little groups and chat for 5-10 minutes and then go off and do some work again.

Like I mentioned above most of what we ordered came out all wrong. Sushi orders were all mixed up, items we didn't even order were constantly being dropped off at our table. It was chaos and we pretty much rolled with the ouches and just had to laugh at how it was one thing after another. It was definitely one of the most bizarre dinners we ever had.

Oh and someone might want to let the hostess know she doesn't have to scream the large font headers on the menu to the patrons at the table when she seats them, I was near deaf afterwords and we could barely keeps ourselves from bursting out laughing.




I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had tried Crave when it first opened and felt it was nothing really special. We went back for a date night based on their signage outside offering a date night special! It consisted of 2 appetizers and 2 entrees (from a choice of 5 or so) 2 small desserts and a bottle of wine for $50! It was a great deal and great food as well! The portions were perfect and enough that we took home some for lunch the next day! Nicholas was a great server and appeared to be happy at what he was doing! We will definitely do that again!"}
{"text":"I ate here several years ago and the food was excellent, so leading into yesterday I had high expectations for this place. My girlfriend and I go in and I'm so excited to eat here. Our waitress comes and says hello, and my girlfriend immediately asks about happy hour. She returns about 15 min later and just sets down the happy hour menu and takes off. We've been sitting there for 25 min with just waters, and I haven't even been able to ask for a drink yet. Another waitress came over to take our order which I was grateful for. The people sitting next to us were already getting their appetizers and drinks, despite having sat down 10 min after us. Our waitress continued to walk past us not talking to us, so we just left because we couldn't take it anymore. We went to the fine establishment, Raising Canes, which was a great choice that also saved us about 50$. I'm a waiter so I know when customer service is bad; I am understanding and I don't ask for a lot at all. I JUST WANTED A BEER, WINGS, AND A BURGER! Probably dessert too because I was starving. It's too bad our waitress missed out on an easy 20$ tip. 1st bad review I've ever had to write on a place."}
{"text":"Second and last time at Crave. The host was friendly and we were sitted immediately.  Atmosphere was pleasant. A beautiful day to enjoy their patio.

For an appetizer we ordered the truffle fries. My wife and daughter loved them. For our entree we ordered the Crave burger, a sushi roll and Asian salad. Food was good not great. 

Unfortunately, it took over 45 minutes to get out food. Two tables next to us both ordered after us but received their food before us. 

When we complained to our server, Marcos, he said he would have the manager talk to us. Our food came, the Manger never did. Our server told us one more time that the Manger would come to our table. When our bill came, our server said all he could do was give us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit. The problem is there will not be a next visit. We where not looking for a freebie, we just wanted an acknowledgment that this is not the norm or an apology for making us wait. 

You can't tell customers that the Manger will come to the table and he/she never shows.  On top of a lunch Bill of $60 for three people  (no alcohol, one soda)"}
{"text":"I went there on a Wednesday night and it was deserted. Happy hour is from 9 pm to close. Ordered buffalo wings and they came out cold. They were gracious enough to make them for me again but they were slightly better than the first order. I was hungry and so I didn't complain. In addition to the wings, I had chips and guacamole, plus crispy pork dumplings. Both wee alright. Maybe next time, IF I go back, I will try the sushi. The waitress was really nice and attentive which really helped. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything spectacular. The best part of the meal was my mini dessert!"}
{"text":"Food was average, but definitely overpriced for what it is -- bar food and wannabe sushi. Ordered 2 appetizers, one roll, drink, and my  bill was $60. Probably won't come back unless they lower their prices or increase the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Went here for Easter Brunch. I made a reservation because I figured their brunch buffet would be popular, especially on Easter. Got there and discovered the buffet was only at their Minnesota locations...maybe they should have advertised that. Regardless, we decided to stay because we were starving. We were seated at a table closest to the kitchen and shortly after we ordered our food there was complete chaos in the kitchen. I've never seen so many blank stares. There were so many dishes under the hot lamps and some of them sat there for 30+ minutes! It took TWO HOURS to get our food and when we did it wasn't even right. My sandwich was missing cheese and my sister's chocolate chip pancakes were full of blueberries instead. The manager came over to give us our bill and never apologized or anything. Plus it was the FULL bill. Even after they said they would take off the pancakes. The manager never even apologized until my boyfriend went up and complained about the terrible service. We ended up getting 30% off and a gift card for our horrific experience, but I have no intention of returning here. What a waste of time. The only breath of fresh air was our waiter, he was just as frustrated as we were but had a good sense of humor about it. Needless to say, our Easter did not start off on a good note because of CRAVE."}
{"text":"We dropped in here during a 3-night stay in Vegas and enjoyed it immensely. I had mashed potatoes, turkey, fried chicken, corn, and biscuits and would rate each as extraordinary. I also had shrimp which was very good but not extraordinary like my other selections. On the down side, the brisket was kinda chewy and the crab legs disappointed. Fruit and watermelon on the buffet tasted like it was fresh off of an Iowa farm. The server working our area was friendly, alert, helpful, and worked like crazy. Well worth the cost and really was a nice satisfying place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience on the first visit!! I visited the restaurant for work dinner on Wednesday night. We had calamari and bread platter as appetizer and I had scallops as the main dish. I got a terrible food poisoning after the dinner. I was up all night, feeling very sick and I was close going to the emergency room. I have every reason to believe that those scallops were either not properly stored or were not fresh. I would highly recommend not going to this restaurant for sea food unless you want to spend your night on the toilet and throwing up. 

I eat seafood 1-2 times a week and I don't think seafood has ever made me sick.

Edit: ended up going to the emergency room in the morning. Definitely not a good choice of restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and I won't be coming back. The food was mediocre, definitely not worth the prices they charged. $13 for a crab and artichoke dip that was very small and had no visible crab in it.
My friend order the Mac and cheese and I had the special ancho-chili ribeye. She had maybe 6 bites and kept adding salt&pepper to it bc it had no taste. My ribeye was ok, the sauce was very tasty but I enjoy the one at Outback more. 
Our server took about 15-20 minutes to deliver my drink/take our order. Then she returned maybe 2 more times before delivering our check. 
Overall don't bother coming here, it's bad service and mediocre food with a very high price tag."}
{"text":"Super pricey and not that delicious! We spent Valentine's Day at home with and invited our best friends (another couple) over and my bf ordered food from bite squad to be delivered to home. The packaging of the food was ugly, and the portions were ridiculously small! My bf spent over 300$ that night and everything was blah! Nothing special even the chocolate cakes he ordered (tasted like grocery store cake). Complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Sat in bar area.  Service was decent.

The food:

Crispy rice -  Two large square of pale pinkish tuna that looked like very low quality and the consistency of a well blended hummus.  The pieces were too large and had a gagging consistency

Duck Flatbread - Supposedly a specialty.  Tasted like Fig jam and the duck looked like it was microwaved.  Greens were dirty and flacid. 

Sushi - very large pieces but not very good.  Too much rice on the rolls and didn't look appetizing or taste very good

Dips - Soggy cucumber pieces and cold flatbread with three spreads that were decent.  Best food item but not saying much.

None of our food went back to the kitchen empty and almost all of the flatbread was on the plate when the server took it away.  No questions were asked if we liked it or if we were just full.   The truth is it was hard to eat any more.

Manager looked like she was going to a coffee shop with a very large back tattoo and could only be distinguished when she helped with a credit card.  Her appearance was a reflection of food and experience."}
{"text":"Good selection , sushi was ok..
Soup and Turkey Blt was good.
Most likely will come back again !
Atmosphere was fun , clean and no wait"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was average, some servings were cold. Mimosas were not included for brunch. Needed more variety."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place has only 3 stars!! My experience here was great!! The service and food was absolutely amazing!! The ambiance was very relaxed. If you are looking for something different to try out definitely pay a visit to this place! Did I mention the dessert was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The Crave Burger was awesome! I rarely order a burger nevertheless finish one but I ate the whole thing and smiled with each bite. I definitely recommend the Crave Burger. 

The quinoa spinach salad side was good - not as flavorful as the burger but good."}
{"text":"So yummy!!! We had the yellowtail app and sea weesld salad too. Both AMAZING!!! Norwegian Salmon and MahiMahi was on point. 
Our waiter was perfect. He had a man bun and i failed to get his name but he was so good."}
{"text":"From out of town. Great restaurant, wonderful staff, very friendly. The food was superb, excellent service, each course came exactly on time. The manager even came over to see if everything was okay. Will definately go back we we go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been to Crave several times for lunch and have always had a wonderful experience :-) I love the idea that it is a scratch kitchen and the interesting menu choices too (not your average boring items)! The kale salad, bison burger, and lobster mac n cheese are definitely items to try..delicious!  The atmosphere is fun too! I enjoyed being able to watch all the action in the kitchen! If you're looking for a new, fun place to enjoy different kinds of food...this is your spot!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, very rude. I felt like they didn't  care if we will come back or not.  So guess what me and my husband are boycotting Crave.  We will tell all of our friends not to eat there as well.  Good luck surviving next door to Wolfgang puck!!!!"}
{"text":"Bernaise Burger & Pablano Ceasar IS SO DELICIOUS, HEARTY, RICH .. FLAVORS Are PERFECT!! YUMMM  Marcos our waiter was knowledgeable & recommended the above dishes, which I will have again"}
{"text":"What an great experience at Craze.  Staff was on the ball with food and drinks during busy holiday season.  About three to four  Christmas parties were going on and staff was amazing to watch. They were very attentive to us and the parties. Great customer service and cant wait for our next visit.

The seabass was so good think we will be back next week."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a few hours of shopping at Downtown Summerlin. It's quite a large place and wasn't very busy, but it was earlier than the lunch rush and a weekday.

The waiter was very nice and attentive. He was very cute as well. A little young for this old cougar but I won't complain.

Between us, we had the chicken wings and an asian salad. Pretty healthy now that I look back. Five stars for the food and service. Minus one star for my average sized lunch costing me $18. Yeeshka! 

I would say this place would be good for a business lunch where you company is paying or a date, where the guy is paying. Great vibe. I need to get back into dating."}
{"text":"First time here. Sat at the bar and was told the draft beer system was broken for a few weeks, ordered a few drinks, looked over the menus but was ignored time and time again from what seemed to be a short staffed bar....not impressed. Will not return."}
{"text":"3 stars is exactly what it is...although if you consider the prices it maybe should be 2.5. Food was ok, service was ok, and the place was pretty empty for a Friday night. When you are paying good money you should not have to ask for silverware when your food gets to the table. I found it funny that all the empty tables had bread plates, but no silverware. I don't feel any need to go back, so I guess I'll wait for it to go out of business  and change hands before I return."}
{"text":"For being open less than a week, this restaurant is horrible. 6 hostesses at the front telling us it is a 45min wait only to be seated in a restaurant that is only 1/3 full. The meal took an insane amount of time to be brought to us only to have soggy luke warm fries. Sushi was average but not memorable. Dessert (a small mousse cup) took nearly 15 min to be served and STILL had a shortbread cookie in it in spite of us being told it was the only gluten free dessert and us making it clear we needed it without the cookie. Since we had to leave (since the whole meal took twice as long as necessary) The waitress merely suggested it be removed from the bill since it could take another 20 minutes to put mousse in a 2in cup. Absolutely absurd. Looking around the restaurant at any time one saw waiters just loitering around....so they are clearly not under staffed on the floor , maybe the issues stem from the kitchen that isn't even prepared to serve to a restaurant less than half full. I won't bother returning."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and a disgrace to summerlin!
I had the blackened fish tacos and they were mostly filled with the slaw and a very small piece of cold fish... zero flavor! Not to mention, who the hell wants French fries with tacos!!!??? Chips and salsa should be automatic... the fries were cold and undercooked! Not to mention someone there is obviously afraid of salt! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Happy Hour and happy hour prices ($8 and under), even though with adult entrees, kids eat free! We tried the lemon butter wings, crab artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps (amazing), truffle fries, shrimp guppies, firecracker shrimp and some other things. The customer service was absolutely amazing! My son said this is his new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I've dined at Crave restaurant twice.  The food was just ok.  Nothing to rave about.  The atmosphere is nice.  The management staff was just mediocre.  During my first experience, our party ordered 4 Sangria's.  The waiter heads over with the drinks, places three on the table and drops the fourth.  Glass and red sangria spill all over my sister.  The waiter was very apologetic, but the management staffs response was lackluster at best.  They made no attempts to accomodate my sister or replace her sweater which now had red sangria and glass all over it.  The manager never provided her card or name for follow up.  This experience left a bitter taste with us, forcing us to move our weekly girls outing to another location."}
{"text":"First and last time here , food is just average and service was not good , sorry to see a restaurant in such a great location can't do any better ."}
{"text":"Being the only place open in Downtown Summerlin we were kind of forced to try this  restaurant out. 

The atmosphere was alright, it was your typical chain restaurant bland atmosphere.

I know I can't give 0 stars but even if I could I would still give 1 star because our server, Victor, was fun and knowledgeable. 

 I LOVE sushi and was excited to see that they had a menu that was relatable to sushi and non sushi lovers. I ordered the Mexican Roll and a side of sashimi. I was super excited because i love anything spicy. I ate the majority of my roll because it was good! Everything was going great until early the next morning when I felt extremely sick, as did my other friend (who also got the sashimi)."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Kayla is an amazing bartender! She read my mind and came up with best cocktail possible for me!!! She was super nice and friendly, her personality lit up the room. I'm gonna be back! 5 star service Bravo Kayla!!! bravo!"}
{"text":"I was amazed as soon as I walked in! The hostesses were very welcoming and enthusiastic. The waiter had so many great recommendations for their sushi and sandwiches. The food arrived in a timely fashion, the prices maybe a little high for some but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"we visited Crave for the first time today.  The establishment was nice with modern decor and very clean.  The service was excellent, our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions.  Our food selections were not so great however.  We started with the edamame appetizer, it was boring no and bland.  Our son had a flatbread pepperoni pizza that looked good and he enjoyed but the side selections were no good.  I had the pork butt Rueben, didn't like it at all.  Just slices of fat with slaw, should have guessed that though.  My husband had the miso salmon.  He said it was bland and flavorless, where was the miso glaze?  Would maybe give it a second chance sometime."}
{"text":"Had the Crave Burger, it was very tasty, meat was cooked as ordered. The customer service was not good. I asked twice for utensils as my dad had ordered pasta. I ended up and just getting my table's own utensils from another adjacent table. We weren't going to sit there while the food got cold while waiting for utensils. No one stopped me to offer service or replace the utensil sets i just took. It is also very loud. 

I think the concept is great where you can get anything, even sushi here all in one location, but If customer service continues to stink, folks are better off going to sushi loca and 5 guys across the mall."}
{"text":"The happy hour is reasonably priced but the service was not too good.  The drinks were watered down and took forever, meanwhile all the food came out at one time which was quite annoying. The food was okay. The fire alarm went off several times no one came over to apologize or tell us why it was happening. All and all happy hour was not so happy."}
{"text":"We were waiting for a table when we decided to sit down at the sushi bar. We were Amazed by the creativity and delicious plates. Thank you Chefs Luis P., Kevin V., and Aldredo T. for the great experience.  If you are looking for a fresh sushi place this location will exceed your expectations. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this weekend, and enjoyed it very much.  We were seated promptly, and our server took our drink orders.  My daughter was with me, and ordered off the kids menu.  Her sliders were delicious.  I had a Cuban sandwich, which was also delicious.  Our server was friendly, and quickly took care of an item that came out wrong.  Prices are reasonable.  My only complaint (and this happens frequently at other restaurants, too) is that I was about 3/4 through my meal, when our server asked if we had room for dessert.  I finished my bite ( ;-) and said no.  The check was then presented.  I can see that maybe our server thought we were in a rush to get back out shopping, but it's a pet peeve of mine to be asked about dessert when I'm still chewing on my meal!  All in all though, we would return next time we are at Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Have the rib eye, was amazing!!! Cooked to perfectly, girl had a sushi roll she said it was really good. Had a app the crab and artichoke dip was very good, service was amazing, will def recommend this to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Not a terrible experience, but I won't be back. Paid $13 for a sandwich and salad but the portioning is really small for the price. They gave me a small cup instead of a full side salad and the sandwich was pretty small and didn't really have much on it. Service was fair and everything else was fine, but I don't feel I got my money's worth. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Did not expect a great meal because Crave was new  and I assumed that they were not 100% up to speed yet...  I was wrong. It was great!

The cocktail list was amazing! Expertly crafted artisan style.
Sushi was the best I have had in Vegas. (Not the \"same old\" boring sushi that every other place has. ) New quality ingredients and textures that create wonderful flavors that I had yet to experience.

The decor is upscale, warm, and welcoming.

For this price point... definitely a five star experience!"}
{"text":"We were at this restaurant about 4'ish on Monday afternoon during happy hour.  I ordered the Kobe tacos as an appetizer and they were so spicy I could hardly eat them.  My girlfriend ordered the roast chicken w/salsa and specifically asked for no halopenias.  The meal came out spicy hot.  Upon complaining to the waiter, who was also the bartender, we were given the bill with no apologize or reduction in the amount.  Although the restaurant is very quaint, customer service needs to be improved. We will not be going back to this facility."}
{"text":"My husband and I like trying new places to eat. We finally went to Crave for lunch on Father's day. 

We had the dumpling & bruschetta for appetizer which was good and it all went downhill after that. For entree my husband had the crave burger which took forever & I had the bento box which sat at the counter for a while, bento box was a waste of money!!! We were seated right by the service area & sushi bar. Timing was very bad. Our server kept apologizing for the delay in our dessert.

They should have anticipated that it was going to be busy due to father's day."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely nice and friendly. She always had a smile on her face which was very welcoming! We ordered our food and it felt like eternity until it came out. Considering the very very small amount of people in the restaurant, I was confused as to why it took so long... the portions are smaller than usual and the prices are also much higher especially for lunch. I don't even wanna know how much a pasta dish costs for dinner...overall the food was good, nothing special and nothing I couldn't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"New concept of having American and Japanese food fare.  Dishes looking appetizing, but the taste are just average.  Service is off balance.  Not sure if it is due to new opening or volume of folks being served."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night. Wasn't very impressed. The hostesses were nice & since there was an hour left of happy hour and my honey is a beer connoisseur we decided to sit at the bar. Wow, wish we would have just gotten a table. 

One of the bartenders came around & asked me what I'd like to drink. I asked if they had coke. She said \"umm...\" And had to turn around to look at the sodas to see. Then she said yes they did. After she brought our drinks, somehow she disappeared & another woman bartender, Samantha, took over. 

Now I'm not sure what was going on behind the bar, but there was some drama & confusion because the three bartenders were muttering to each other. I'm not sure what the problems were but you could tell they were stressed out. I've worked in restaurants before & I understand how stressful it can be, but that's no excuse to give bad service. And that's what she did. 

We asked for menus & decided we'd just order some apps from the happy hour menu. Samantha, in the middle of listening to our order, walked away from us when another bartender walked by her and said something to her. Just walked away! I wasn't sure if she had gotten all of our order or what! Then she came back and said \"I'm sorry\" & looked at us so we ordered again. 

Basically once we ordered we hardly saw her again. Pretty sad considering we were AT THE BAR and so on front of her the whole time.

Our food was good, especially the beef tacos & the tempura sushi. Very good. 

When it was time to pay the bill we put the money in the glass & waited for Samantha to close it out. Only she didn't pick it up. She kept walking back & forth, making drinks, etc. completely ignoring us until finally my boyfriend called out \"excuse me. We'd like to close our tab out\". Pretty sad. 

All in all, we'll probably go back again. But never will I sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Decent food and atmosphere was ruined by absolutely poor service.  Our server made horrible errors at every stage of the meal; forgot a cocktail and a second drink, brought the wrong bottle of wine (didn't catch it until AFTER we opened it - my bad) but the right bottle was on the bill (more expensive than what we drank!), brought starters out WITH the entrees, didn't check on us until AFTER I'd already finished my entree... really annoying stuff you'd expect at a noisy family burger joint, not a mid-priced restaurant posing as a four-star dining establishment.  It's an over-glorified Red Robin, complete with sophomoric cheers and \"alrights\" as we ordered, from an amateur server who is best suited for a college hangout than a \"dining experience\".  I blame management for this nonsense; I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 1 star.. Although the service is good... The food was not something I would come back for. It was very bland and unsatisfying. This was my first time and more than likely my last"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated....have had better food from a Food truck."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and everything was delicious! Will definitely be back... Ordered the chicken caprese rosa and risotto balls to start and both were amazing! Loved the cute live music too"}
{"text":"Lisa& I came here for lunch. Have to say very nice place with different variety food. The customer service friendly& helpful. Highly recommend this place to everyone .."}
{"text":"I will never go back again! My husband and I went there for the 1st time; needless to say, we were starving. The hostess sat us down and nobody showed up to take our orders. We literally sat at our table for 12 minutes w/o any service. We walked out, but before leaving we stopped at the hostess stand. We politely told them why we were leaving. They stared at us blankly without remorse, and did not even try to stop us."}
{"text":"There are plenty of good restaurants at Downtown Summerlin, but we love to support the annual Restaurant Week, so we decided to stop in here on a recent weekday. The food was fine, and the price was right--especially considering that some of our $20 lunch was going to a good cause!

My husband had the avocado rolls and the Crave burger. Not much to say about the rolls, but the burger was pretty good. I had the edamame and bento box, and I think I got the better bargain. The edamame was delicious--among the best I've ever had--served warm with a tasty Sriracha soy glaze. The bento box was chock-full of delights, from fruit and salad to fried shrimp and four different types of rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and cucumber). We both had the mini blueberry cheesecake for dessert, which was served parfait-style. As I said, the food was fine, but nothing (except for that awesome edamame) was compelling enough to bring me back.

Service was good, although they brought out our entrees before we had finished our appetizers. While waiting for our food, I read their happy hour menu, and that looks like a promising deal. Much of the menu reads like the Yard House happy hour, which is one of my favorites, so if I lived nearby, I think I would stop in occasionally for that. But otherwise, I think I will try one of the other Downtown Summerlin restaurants next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"We were starving and since this was the only restaurant open, we decided to give it a try.
From the moment we walked in, the hostesses were pretty clueless and despite many empty tables, they said there was a 15 minute wait. No problem we said, we will have a drink at the bar. There were three bartenders working, and the tall male bartender directly in front of us wouldn't turn around to ask me if I wanted anything to drink. He was too busy chatting to the other bartenders and slicing his lemons and garnish.  I was practically waiving the menu to get his attention but was unsuccessful. Luckily the hostess came over and said our table was ready. She brought us to a high top table in the bar area which was too small for me and my guest. I asked for a normal table in the restaurant area and she said no problem, but it will be another 10-15 minutes. Ok, I will try to get that pumpkin spice Ale that I was thirsty for. Still unsuccessful in getting the bartenders attention (he is really focused) the hostess comes back and seats us at a booth in the back. On the way, I told her about the problem with the bartender. She just smiled and told me to ask my server for a beverage. She was totally unaccommodating.

The server came and she was great, so no real complaints about her. I did notice however that most of the servers came and went like waves. I mean they would be all over the tables and then they would all disappear for  7-10 minutes at a time. I mean no service staff at all in the restaurant. 

The appetizers came and they were fantastic. It took about an hour for our entrees to make it to the table, steak salad and burger. Steak salad was great, however the french fries on the burger plate were soggy as a sponge. So they were sent back and replaced. When I went to eat the burger, the bottom bun was saturated from grease. In fact, the hamburger was sitting in an oil slick puddle of grease. Pretty gross. The manager came to the table after speaking to our server about the issue after about 10-15 minutes. Seems there were some problems with their Point of Sale system and he was concerned with that issue. He took the burger away and he replaced it with a sandwich which was more of a wrap, and it was tasty. He replaced the replacement fries as well again as they were just as soggy as the first if not more.

The acoustics in the restaurant are not very good either, it is very loud inside. Very much like a sports bar. Good luck having a conversation.

I know this restaurant just opened, but I expected more from them. I would be willing to give them another try, but it wont be any time soon. Hopefully they will still be in business by the time I do decide to patronize them again."}
{"text":"First time at Crave yesterday for brunch. I probably won't visit again. Our waiter was super friendly! Such a nice guy, but only came around a few times. We had the manager on duty help us out most of the time just because he was always near by. Once we ordered our food it took over 30 minutes to get to our table, for 3 of us. Wasn't a busy afternoon at all either. We ordered Huevos Rancheros & 2 plates of Chilaquiles. We were served tortilla chips & eggs. Nothing special. Price too high for someone who knows what Chilaquiles & huevos rancheros look like & taste like."}
{"text":"I sell furniture at the macys summerlin store and frequent CRAVE quite often. Their lunch specials are delicious and reasonably priced. The service is hit or miss, which is the reason for the 3 stars. 
I also went for drinks here and am obsessed with their red sangria, SO good. 
They also have groupons $15 for $30 of food, a great buy!"}
{"text":"First off...those who are reading reviews about wanting to go to Crave, ignore all the reviews where people are bashing them about service.  Keep in mind, they just recently open and like all new restaurants, venues, hotels, there will always be some level of service issue.

I for one can say, we did experience some negative service but not by the staff.  But the organization of the kitchen.  Our experience ended up where dinner turned out to be an 2 hour ordeal, but it wasn't unpleasant as the staff were very tentative and apologetic.  We sat by the kitchen so we were able to see what all the held up was.  So I can ding them for the slow service but I am not going to because service provided by the staff was execellent and I honestly cannot fault the staff for something that is out of their control.  I would say the the GM is to look at your kitchen, your line cook and get that together.  But I won't be harsh because we went on openinlg weekend.

Now for the food, I made two appetizer plates into my dinner; the Pork Belly Sliders with kimchi, Korean BBQ sauce, cilantro and the Kogi Beef Tacos with red miso, napa slaw, sesame.  I was a bit disappointed that the Pork Belly Sliders weren't serve in the steam buns that I am so used to have pork belly with, but the flavor and the meat was excellent!  I may ask next time when I order to see if it is possible to get the steam buns.  Now the Kogi Beef Tacos were my favorite!  I can eat those ALL DAY!  And I might even just order two of those next time as dinner!  The meat was so flavorful and rich, with the red miso, napa slaw to give it that nice sweet and spicy kick!  

I can't find fault in this place.  Food was good, service (staff) were attentive and friendly and I am sure it will take time for the kitchen to figure out a smooth system.  Until then, I will still be coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place has been open a few weeks, ample time for a new restaurant to get it together. We went in the middle of the afternoon, so it was not busy. We were sat right away, and our waiter came out shortly after to get our drinks in. We paid the $2 for the bread basket, and while it was adequate, the stuff that was supposed to be crispy was soggy. Just, no. it really should have been free. The runner who dropped it off took the time to explain what each of the breads were, by touching each one! Wtf! We had to laugh. The menu is extensive and appealing, but, They were out of the sandwich my boyfriend ordered, which seems to be a theme in alot of other reviews. He settled on a burger that featured a foie grais butter, and i got the steak sliders, both with fries. As we waited for our food, we had time to look around the restaurant, It was not busy at all, and it was obvious because there were waiters everywhere, standing around and talking in the middle of the restaurant, one guy even stood in the middle of the restaurant and texted on his phone! Gross! Some food got dropped off at a table near us and we could hear the waiter say to another one, \"bet that food gets sent back, looked pretty bad.\" Umm what? At least we were entertained while we waited for our food. Our food comes, and yikes, it didn't look good. My sliders were sloppily put together, the crispy fried onion strings were really pale and under done, the steak had no flavor and the color of it was... Unappealing. There was no detectable juniper mayo, and the buns were underwhelming. There were about 9 soggy greasy French fries on my plate, and the temperature of my food was Luke warm. My boyfriends burger was ordered at medium well, it came out well done, and the bun was burnt to a crisp. His fries were also cold and soggy. There was no foie grais butter to speak of, either. I felt really bad for our waiter, he must know how bad their kitchen is because he brought us out fresh fries without us even saying a word about them. 

We left our waiter a nice tip, as it wasn't his fault, it is clear to me that he was trying his best despite a kitchen that doesn't seem to care.

Bottom line, this place needs to get it together quick, or it will be gone as soon as the other restaurants open. It seems poorly managed and the kitchen is a mess to say the least, zero quality control. For a $40 lunch, we would have had a better meal at 5 guys."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I am a server and can easily find something to complain about but this time there is NOTHING! Our first time here of soon to be many times. We will be back. Merissa was our server and she was so nice, very helpful. She made a new experience so much better. Very initiative and great service! The rib eye and avocado roll was to die for!!! I can't wait to try new things and come back! You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, I wanted to eat here. It seemed modern and interesting. Plus that, it was crowded so must be a good thing. It was easy to make reservations and I made them on open table. 
There were a lot of items to choose from on the menu from appetizers to drinks to entrees to desserts...we just got to come back again. For our appetizers, we tried their edamame and namasu (guess we missed Hawai'i a little). I had the mahimahi with shrimp and macadamia nut rice and banana fig butter. \"So Ono!\"  My husband just loved his sea bass with pesto and guacamole salsa. So innovative. 
We had a difficult time deciding on dessert but finally decided on the sampler with 3 items; triple berry, blueberry cheesecake and chocolate silk parfaits. 
The next time we visit Vegas, Crave is a must!"}
{"text":"we go out as a group of friends and we go out regularly and every time we leave dinner we always compare it to crave hahah. I got the 702 burger and it was amazing probably the best burger i have had in months the staff was friendly and took great care of us"}
{"text":"We finally checked this place out during Restaurant Week. Love it! Service was fantastic. Cone during happy hour on weekdays and the sushi is half price. Food tastes great. Parmesan truffle fries are amazing. Trendy ambience. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour while our kids were still shopping at Downtown Summerlin. The service was average as well as the food. The happy hour menu was pretty extensive. We chose the California rolls & pesto chicken flatbread. The California rolls were good and came out fast. Then we ordered the flatbread. It took a long time to get to our table and when it finally arrived it was warm at best.  I think it would have tastes better if it was hot. A little disappointing because the restaurant was not busy. I think we will go back and give Crave another try."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and the place was empty other than 2 girls at the bar. Bartender was great but lacked knowledge of a roll and I couldn't eat mayo and it came out with spicy mayo. Beautiful bar and I'll give this spot another chance one day."}
{"text":"I'm compelled to write a review. We went to dinner last minute and took our little dog with us. They were so accommodating. Everything from our hostess making sure we were comfortable and she clearly had a good handle on everything - to the server and food. And our little dog was welcomed too!"}
{"text":"Everything was edible but below average at best. I had the steak sliders and they were okay but the bun was phenomenal. The side salad was pretty good.
My wife ordered the baked penne which tasted like a cheap lasagna that you would bake at home.
We also got the truffle fries as a snack and those were GREAT. 
Good atmosphere but bad service. Our waiter walked by several times without even asking if we needed anything after we were completely done with our meal. We probably won't be coming back, and I doubt crave stays in downtown Summerlin very long.
Our bill took FOREVER to come and it had 2 items on there that we didn't even order"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Would definitely return.
I had 2 items from the sushi menu and really enjoyed the Aloha wrap. Great pita bread for snacking on while waiting for the food. It kinda feels like a newer Kona Grill for anyone who goes to Boca Park. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Crave for the first time yesterday. The restaurant is designed to be very comfortable and inviting. Overall I gave the restaurant four stars because I thought my meal and the meal my wife ate was really good. If I had to rate the service from our waiter who was named Craig, I would give him a a solid 5 star rating. He was very friendly and attentive to our every need. I guess everybody has their own experiences here, but I know for sure that my wife and I will be going back again and hopefully we get Craig as our waiter."}
{"text":"After having dined at CRAVE several times, I feel like I have enough info to write a review.

The first time I went to CRAVE was at the soft opening months ago. I thought the restaurant had great ambiance and being able to try several items on the menu gave me a prespective of the type of food CRAVE offers. The items we tried were hit or miss, but overall I got a good feeling from the food we tried and knew we would be back.

We came back probably a month or so after and I ordered the Lamb Meatballs which is a Signature Dish at crave. It was AWFUL and I do not use that word often to describe food. The pasta portion of the dish was fine but the Meatballs were extraordinarily bland and did not taste fresh. I would not be surprised if they used frozen meatballs. My mother-in-law also had to send her dish back because the lobster tasted awful.

I came back last night with a livingsocial coupon and because opentable was giving 1,000 dining points. I actually was pleasantly surprised with my meal. I ordered the edamame starter which at $8 was definitely not worth it, but tasted fine. I ordered the chicken apple sausage flat-bread and a couscous salad as a side. The salad came out first and it was great. The dressing was very refreshing. The flat bread next came out and it was amazing! The mix of flavors between the sausage, bell pepper, and balsamic vinaigrette was unique and blended together well. It was around $16 which is a little over-priced but I would order it again. My husband just got a burger and fries and it was the perfect medium rare, very juicy and he was a happy guy! I also thought the service was great.

Overall, food is VERY hit or miss. Additionally, the food is generally not worth the prices. It appears there is a happy hour menu, which might be a better deal, but I have not tried.

Service is just ok. I have had terrible service there, but last night it was great. Jury is out on that.

Ambiance is great. Beautiful restaurant in a great location. Food is average and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Service, food ... Except for the sushi .... The volcano roll had huge cucumber chunks that made it difficult to eat. After removing the cucumber the roll was okay."}
{"text":"It's hard to say... Haven't decided on the ratings yet, I guess I'll determine that at the end of my review.... Well two times I have been there and both experiences have had issues. I usually Pay attention to my surroundings with what can be taking so long or what can be possible on why it's been so long on waiting for pretty much everything. With that being said the manager is great, checks up on you a few times to make sure everything is ok, the standards with the waiters and waitresses are there, but what causes me to be there for an extensive amount of time? Two words, -Understaffed - (wait is that one word or two) haha! You get the picture! But yes service lacks with being understaffed even when it's not busy. But you know lets put that aside. The food is great here for what it is. The 702 burger is a hit. The truffle fries for sure. Chips and guacamole, yup! And the crispy pot stickers are great. The half off wine is what keeps me coming back, you take that away then there is no way I'll be back. So I guess it gives you plenty of time to Drink the bottle  but you know I see what the situation might be with the waiters and waitresses, and I always take care of them real good because I know they are short staffed. If I'm wrong I want my $20.00 back ! Jordan thanks for the service!"}
{"text":"We were a group of eight getting together to reminisce and reconnect over dinner. the atmosphere is great and in western tradition blends meat (burgers) with Asian (sushi). Just up our taste. The service is excellent and helpful.
Overall, we had a good time but nothing really stood out. All the lows were raised but the highs were also lowered. The best thing was who we were with and we chose to go elsewhere as soon as the meal ended."}
{"text":"Celebrated friends birthday here. Apart from the fact that we got 50% off on our total bill which is very nice for a group of 9, we had a great deal. However there were very few staff in the restaurant and our waiter was basically attending most of the tables in the back area with another big group. It must be frustrating on his part  which makes the service slow. Not to mention that we even asked him to take photos of the group several times. Food is just ok but we had a great time anyways."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the service we received today from Cassie.  

It was a beautiful but hot memorial day lunch hour so we opted to sit out on the patio.  Our server Cassie was very attentive to our needs from making sure our water glasses were always filled to going out of her way moving our table under the umbrella as the shade shifted. 

As for the food, I was thrown off by the menu which seemed to be all over the place.  The cuisine is \"American\" and Sushi. We ordered various dishes from sushi to macaroni and cheese to a burger to short rib tacos and my pork belly on fried rice.  See what I mean? 

Overall,  the food had good flavor but I've had better.   My rating is mostly based on Cassie and her service.  If it weren't for her,  I'd only be giving this restaurant 3 stars but the fact that she ran all the way to the parking lot in 90+ degree heat to hand us the sunglasses that my niece forgot at the table,  just earned themselves an extra star. 

Thank you for your exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Three of us for dinner. The wedges salad was just fair. The soup tasted like marinara and very thick. Edamame was full of soy sauce and tasted burnt. Kogi beef tacos were just awful.   The crave burger was good.  Mascarpone stuffed chicken. The crust was burnt as was the asparagus. Overall the experience was just ok.  They refunded the soup and Kogi tacos."}
{"text":"I wish I had read reviews before coming in, we were greeted promptly and with a smile but it took awhile for anyone to come to our table (there were 2 other couples at two other tables-so it was not busy) our server was just ok, he was polite. He kept forgetting to bring our waters and only refilled our waters once (and that took awhile). I ordered the black bean soup (it was also jUsT ok- actually Panera's is mucH better!) I also ordered Caprese flat bread no complaints there,  portion was good for the price. My fiance ordered the lobster linguine (I believe it was around $23-25, additional charge if you want a side of bread with your pasta) we could not believe when it was served how small the portion was, I've seen children's meals with more food. Price doesn't matter when you get what you pay for but to pay the prices we did and have my fiance still leave there hungry..... yeah total disappointment. Too many other options within walking distance, we won't return."}
{"text":"I would just like to say: CRAVE has some of the best jambalaya I've ever had! And I've been to New Orleans where I have had some great jambalaya."}
{"text":"Came to check out their happy hour with my girlfriends. The restaurant has nice interior, great flow to the bar. 
They have a huge selection of happy hour drinks and food. Drinks range from $4-$6 and food from $5-$8. We ordered shrimp tempura roll, veggie roll, margarita flat bread, chips and guacamole, queso and Parmesan truffle fries. Food was very good, definitely bang for the buck at the happy hour pricing. Although I wish there was a little more guacamole and queso. There were a lot of chips but not enough guac and queso. For drinks we had their happy hour Cabernet and Chardonnay. 
Our server Ashley was friendly and efficient. 
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was actually impressed with this place. They had delicious cocktails and a decent happy hour selection for food. I could see myself coming back."}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner and we were all pretty impressed. Aside from the service glitches, CRAVE is on the right path. 

For starters we placed an order of the cheese and bacon loaded tater tots in addition to edamame. Plain edamame can get pretty boring, CRAVE adds a twist by tossing the edamame in a special sauce blend - so good! 

For an entree, I was craving (ha!) a burger, so I went with the 702 burger and I loved it! The bacon was the right amount of crispy, the burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it and the egg was a perfect touch... in hindsight, I'm wondering why they didn't just call it a breakfast or hangover burger, ha!

CRAVE has a decent beer list, when it's available. It took me three beer brands to finally order something that they actually had in house... Pro Tip: Update your menu as often as you switch out the menu items so that your guests don't get let down. 

The only major discrepancy was the service... the evening wasn't TOO cold so we wanted to sit outside. The hostess was prompt and our wish was granted. The server, not so prompt. I feel like it took her quite a bit to greet us and when she finally did, we were treated as if we were inconveniencing her more than anything. She couldn't seem to get away from our table fast enough... quick to walk away before everyone had even had their questions answered. People have bad days/nights though, so I'm willing to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time my husband and I are here.  Because of our first time here, we ordered conservatively. We ordered the chicken wings and the chicken pandoori sandwich and split.  Most of the sliced apples were on one side of the sandwich along with most of the chicken. It tasted good but had too much sauce. The French fries were terrible!  They need to have good oil or fresh oil for the fries to taste good. The manager needs to step it up with his quality control. This would be a great place if they were more attentive to the food that was served."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We ordered scallop shooters, lemon garlic wings, Bison burger and the Lamb meatball pasta. All had fantastic flavor, no complaints there. 

But the service........ Terrible. 
First, we waited 10minutes after getting seated for someone to notice us.  Food took a long time to come out even if they were about half capacity. They served us the wrong food. I had to stand up to ask for water 2x. It was hard to get the servers to pay attention even if a lot of them were just standing around."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a company dinner party , and too put it nicely it was nothing special , their menu is very random from sushi to burgers to pasta . I ordered the rainbow roll and the fish was okay again nothing amazing very similar to sushi from a grocery store and for the price defiantly not worth it I also ordered the albacore nigiri and that was a huge disappointment, a coworker ordered the Godzilla roll it was so big and tasteless too much work for a blain roll , onto the burgers the bison burger was served literally burnt and the fries were over salted ,the lobster linguini was flavored good  but for the price you get 1 1/2 claw very tiny  and a very small portion of pasta that was undercooked lastly another coworker ordered the gluten free chicken salad (a plus this place has a gluten free menu) so you really couldn't go wrong with lettuce , we also had to constantly ask for refills mind you our group was only 9 people very disappointed . It's such a great location and very nice place itself but the food just isn't up to par"}
{"text":"Food: My wife ordered the pulled chicken farfalle pasta, I had the lamb meatballs, and for appetizer and calamari which came out good. The pulled chicken and the lamb meatballs wasn't any good didnt understand how the spinach, chicken, and artichoke combination became a pasta dish. As for the lamb meatballs I expected the taste to be of meditteranean which it did, I just did not like how the lamb meatballs were prepared they were dry and  the sauce wasnt really a good combination with the meatballs.

For the price of the food expected the quality and taste to be at par with the restaurants at the strip sadly its not.

Ambiance: The ambiance is very good. The restaurant would be good for date nights 

Location: Downtown summerlin, which is a very good location.

Overall: I would not come back not unless the quality of the food improves. Paying a high price with so so food is not for me."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant this past weekend. WOW. What an amazing place this is. We walked in and was greeted by a wonderful hostess, she was friendly and polite.The decor here is very beautiful.  We were seated as a party of 6. Got menus and waters right away. They have a variety of things to choose from to eat. We ordered all sorts of stuff and we were able to share and try everything out... FOOD was BOMB.... Service was BOMB also. When Im back in Las Vegas I will sure to be back. The one thing that I noticed was we sat at a booth and if you want a more romantic and intimate setting they have a curtain which I assume you can close so you can have your privacy,,, Very cute for couples..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. We assumed the slow service was due to it being busy. But we were wrong, it seemed as if the crew were not only understaffed but miserable as well. I could see it on the hostesses' face as well as the rest of the staff. What we thought would take us an hour ended up being two hours. Staff would disappear for minutes on end to the point that two groups who were sat down decided to leave. Refills took forever. The food however was good; I'll give them that. The service is just really bad. Go elsewhere, there are better choices a few steps away."}
{"text":"The sushi was very good, but entirely over priced.  I.e. Scallop poppers were $10 for three little poppers. The Godzilla roll was $19 for an average sized roll.  Like I said, it was tasty, but a $73 bill for two rolls , app, 2 beers, and glass of wine...........could have just gone to a local sushi joint and saved about $25-$30"}
{"text":"I picked Crave for Mother's Day for my wife because my daughter and I absolutely loved it when we ate there a few weeks ago.
I figured it would be busy being it will be Mother's Day so I made reservations.  There was a slight wait when we got there but no big deal.  Our waitress walked by and stopped with a stern look and said, \"I'll be back!\"  Who are you, the effing Terminator.\"?
Anyway she came back to take our drink order.  My wife wanted a cappuccino but couldn't find it on the menu and our kind waitress said, \"Oh it's not on the menu.\"  Helpful, but doesn't tell us what other drinks you may have.  At this point, I'm starting to notice food boogers all over the silverware and asked for a cleaner option but spoke too soon.  The water glasses had stuff chunked on the sides as well and once we finished the appetizer, there was some pasty/dry/cheesy crap now smeared across the table which was nothing of the likes of what we ordered.  This apparently is on the bottom of the disgusting plate.
Since our dining experience is not quite going as expected, we begin discussing places we should have gone.  I was thinking to myself, are we really discussing my shortcomings of picking a suitable restaurant for Mother's Day?  Wow, now I feel like an ass!  I felt even more like an ass when the food came out.  Not sure who the broad was that brought out the food but she had no clue what she was doing nor could identify anything on the plates.  No worries, here comes our friendly neighborhood waitress that's been such a joy.  Everyone finally got what they ordered however the food was cold.  My daughter got the Crave Burger.  I'm assuming the buns are not fresh because when I say cold, I mean you could have reduced swelling of an injury with her hamburger.  Both my wife's food and mine were also below room temp.  This was the straw that broke the camels back.  Check please!

My daughter and I were excited to take my wife here for Mother's Day.  Now we're going to one of the places we discussed while waiting for our food.  Sorry Crave, won't be back...ever."}
{"text":"I just went there there for lunch today.  The food was good and it was a great price."}
{"text":"Second time I've eaten here.  Food good. Service absolutely the worst and slowest on the planet.  
 Each time
I've been here 25 minutes to order cocktails and server rarely returned. 

Also looks like a cafeteria style setting way too any tables that are empty."}
{"text":"Just dined there last night for the first time and actually had a wonderful experience! My family and I came in around 5pm for dinner. It was pretty quiet because it was before dinner time, and a Tuesday night. Our server was Jordan and he provided amazing service throughout our dinner. He started off by giving us waters right away. He gave great recommendations and was very knowledgeable with the menu. Some time in between he came back with warm steamed hand towels for us to clean our hands, which was a great touch. Our food came out shortly after. We order tuna tataki, Philly roll, Angus sliders, chicken pesto flatbread, and caprese chicken pasta. Everything was really great, although I'd skip the pasta and flatbread. They were kinda boring and bland dishes. At the end Jordan let us know that if we signed up for a rewards card, we'd receive a free mini tiramisu. We signed up and the tiramisu was delicious. Overall the  service was impeccable and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Well...that is nice to actually give 1 star. Service was BEYOND mediocre! Hardly had patrons seated and nobody came to get the drink orders. The table next to us had the same experience. When we stopped a server walking by our table he said \"we are short staffed and too busy\"... without any exaggerations there were maximum 5 occupied tables with an average of 5 people per table. Finally, after 45 minutes waiting we got our food....and it was nothing excelling!!!!
Would NOT recommended to anyone...except for s secret dinner."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to duck out of Halloween much to the chagrin of the GF.  I thought Downtown Summerlin would be a chill place to avoid trick or treaters.  The GF informed me this was the only restaurant currently open in the mall.  I thought we should give it a shot.

I read some of the reviews talking about the wait.  We were fortunate to be seated in quick fashion.

Our Harry Potter dressed server was prompt in taking our drink orders.  I tried a \"Lazy Uncle Jack.\"  It contained JD whiskey, blueberries, and sweet and sour.  Tasty enough..I ordered a second.  These were about in the area of $10 a pop.

For my meal I chose the \"Bison Burger.\"  It was topped with pork belly, cilantro mayo, and pickled shallots.  Cooked to medium, it was A-OK.

Until Downtown Summerlin launches everything it is going to offer in the way of dining, CRAVE will do you in a pinch."}
{"text":"It was just before 10pm, they are still open. Went up to the host's stand to get a table. The girl said sorry we're closed. I asked \"what time do you close?\"  she said 10. I said well it is 10 to 10 so you are still opened. She said sorry the kitchen is closing and by time you order will be too late. Wow for a new business trying to make it not very professional. They should be happy to get what ever business comes in. Won't be back!! Impression starts at the front door!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with this restaurant! I've been wanting to come here for awhile since it has sushi and American food as well. My husband got a small roll and said it was fresh. He got the bison burger and I got turkey burger. They both were made fresh and tasted great! Our waiter was Vincent and he was excellent. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Crave burgers, Parmesan/truffle fries, & salad were tasty, but there's something about lukewarm-coldish food, especially soggy fries, that I strongly dislike. Our waitress was friendly but seemed eager to clock out already.  After our food was served, no one asked how we were doing. This place might have strong potential if they improve on service. Otherwise, there are many other places to get the same if not better and less expensive type of food."}
{"text":"Place looks great so we decided to try it. The food was disappointing. The service was ok. I don't think I will be back here again."}
{"text":"The place is slipping. Service and the dish quality varies each visit. Tonight our super pleasant server forgot the bread and took forever to bring the check. Otherwise, a really nice kid.

But the food... First, their draft beer is served way too warm. My steak was thrown on top of the mashed potatoes, asparagus was as thin as I've ever seen, kids carrots were discolored and inedible and the Mac and cheese was a runny, tasteless mess.

Last trip for us."}
{"text":"Well my husband and I with some friends decided to ignore the recent reviews and try this new restaurant. We all thought let's give it a try and chance. We went for happy hour and at first it was ok. We ordered drinks and appetizers though our food came first warm we had to ask for our drinks ... A bit strange !!! Then we ordered  a second round food was cold and our drinks were not only total wrong and completely off with no alcohol and they served a martini in a juice glass !! Who does that !! The drink that was to be made with rum was served with a splash of whisky instead. Service was horrible had to ask for everything at least twice. Happy hour  for what you got is pricy and don't go in the bathrooms I had to rummage thru the storage units to find the toilet paper. To say the least if they don't get it together this Restaurant won't last !!! I expected a lot more especially from a new Summerlin hot spot."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last night for dinner and after waiting 25 mins for a table we were seated and our server was excellent.  Very attentive and quick.  We ordered wine which was very good and got to the table within minutes.  On the server's suggestion, my fiancé ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer and I ordered the poblano Caesar salad, both very good but the jumbo shrimp was not hot.  Our mains came out midway through eating our appetizers which was quite annoying, we felt rushed.  He ordered the half chicken which was good, Jamaican flavours.  I ordered the farfalle pasta which was warm in the middle and cold on the outside when I received it.  I mentioned the temperature to the server and she offered to take it back to pan fry and I said no that's ok.  Our bill was $98 and we tipped $15.  A bit expensive for the rushed feeling but the flavours of the food was very good and I will give this new restaurant a chance to work out its kinks."}
{"text":"The parmesan truffle fries...sigh. I *crave* them all the time. The Salmon nigiri is fresh and sweet. The sushi rolls are sadly heavy on the rice, and light on fish and veg. We've been twice, and the service has been pleasant and friendly each time. The atmosphere is typical Summerlin, whether that be a positive or negative is up to you. I'd go back for the fries any day, any time."}
{"text":"The few times we have been there have been a mediocre experience.  I was expecting more being one of the anchor restaurants for the Downtown Summerlin mall.  Maybe it's just because they are working out the bugs.  The food is decent and presented well but the service is a little off still.  We've been there a total of 4 times and will wait to try again in the future when they have some more experience."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to give this place a try as we had plans to see a movie. Our waitress brought us our drinks and we ordered the lobtser and spinach dip. For 14.00, we both felt it was a really small portion, but tasted fine.  He then ordered the salmon and I ordered the crave burger.  The wait was very long for the food and our waitress only came by once to refill our drinks. After the food arrived, I found the burger to be really bland and my partner's salmon was really undercooked.  We didn't have time to order anything else, so asked the waitress to just take the salmon of the tab. It was amazing how fast our waitress was to get us the tab and get us cashed out, but couldn't even stop by twice to see if our drinks needed refilling. My partner didn't get dinner and had to order food at the theater.  Sorry, but this experience isn't worth another trip back."}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended this place gave us a coupon for a free appetizer so we thought why not.
   Convenience store sushi will top this place 10 to 1."}
{"text":"First time in downtown Summerlin and thought we'd stop by for some lunch. My boyfriend and I thought this would be a good spot. When you walk in and the atmosphere was very nice and we were greeted right away by the hostess. We didn't have to wait to long, had a wonderful waitress and gave us the lunch menu. Had a variety of choices to choose from.  We started off by the chicken avocado spring roll which was good.  It had more of avocado than chicken.  On to our entree's my boyfriend ordered the chicken, apple brie' sandwich and I got the salmon salad.  When his sandwich came out it was different it than your regular bread it came as a focaccia bread folded in half - Like eating a taco.  It was yummy!  Very good tasting.  My entree' had great presentation and the portion was just perfect - My salmon was cooked perfectly along w/ the other wilted spinach and israel couscous. Every bite was complimentary to everything.  We also had dessert which was good.  You can pick individuals or sharable.  We chose from sharable - Smore's brownie (it said ice cream but it wasn't it was just a marshmallow topping) and the cheesecake w/ rhubarb strawberry topping - Very good but huge. All and all, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu. Bradley the bartender is great. We left wolfgangs still hungry and we found a wonderful menu at the bar that was perfect."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas visiting my daughter and grandkids.  We went to Summerlin to do some Xmas shopping.  Since we were hungry , we decided to get a \" quick bite \" and go on our way.  The restaurant was not busy and we liked the fact that they were not playing loud obnoxious music.  Then everything went downhill.   In hind site i wish we had just left .  We had our menus which were long and there were about 3 different parts that went with the menu - there was the main one and then I think a lunch one and maybe something else.  The server asked what we wanted and we told her we needed more time but we did want some drinks and 2 waters    For whatever reason it took quite awhile to get our drinks and had to ask a 2nd time for water .  She finally reappeared to take our order and since we had already been there for 20\" we requested an appetizer to ( hold us over ).   Another 10 - 15\" went by  and no appetizer so we grabbed the manager (?)  and he said there was a mix up because of shift change and our appetizer had not been made yet !  To appease us he brought us some calamari (on the house because it had been made by mistake ). After another 20\" we finally got our food, which was mediocre  and our server had her head in the clouds    Could hardly wait to get our boxes and check and get the hell out of there.   Awful experience. All total we were probably there an hour and 20 minutes    Certainly was not a quick bite.  It was  agonizing and we will never return ever !"}
{"text":"Channell are server was very good didn't miss a beat thank you we shall be back the gluten free menu is great lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the days are numbered here. Went in right after the parade, which was packed with people, and told a 25 minute wait for a nearly empty restaurant. Hmmm.... that should have been our first clue. Ok....we are slow learners!! The hostess said most of the servers were a no show. Probably because they were not making any money. Anyway, we waited and ate. Food was OK, but would have been better if the food wasn't sitting under a barely working heat lamp, forever, because the service is awful!! And I mean AWFUL!! I did give it an extra star because kids eat free and I love free!! I do like the atmosphere, so I hope another restaurant moves in when this one closes."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try. That was a mistake. The burger my husband got just average. I ordered a filet medium rare and the first one I got was medium/medium well. Sent it back and the second one was rare. By this time my family was done eating so I didn't want to sit and wait yet again for them to get it right. On top of that I had to saw through both meats and it was quite chewy. I don't where they get their beef from but they need to change suppliers. Filet should melt in your mouth and to be frank...Outback steakhouse does a better job. To top it off it was under-seasoned and the mashed potatoes were overwhelmingly truffled. The fries were pretty much the best thing they had. They offered a free dessert but by then, with our slow waiter, we ready to go home and declined. Overall it was overpriced and under-delivered."}
{"text":"Walking in on Tuesday night and were sat right away. We were seated at high top table by the bar, we were not offered to be sat in the restaurant or the sushi bar. It was our first time here so we really didn't know the restaurant offered. Our server Stephanie was super sweet and knowledgeable. She helped me pick out a popular margarita, I believe the lime and ginger, to start with. They also have a lot  of beers on tap which my friend enjoyed. We started with the crab and artichoke dip and the bread basket. The bread basket it not complimentary but it's only $2.00. I loved put starters, everything was warm, gooey and flavorful. I asked for another popular margarita drink and Stephanie told me about the prickly pear. I decided to go with it. When it came  out and was a very pretty drink but not my style. Stephanie graciously switched it out for the lime and ginger one. We ordered two pastas to share. The lobster linguine and the lamb meatballs. The lobster linguine was great, nice chunks of lobster, the sauce was buttery and light. The goat cheese meatballs were in a Pablano sauce that was just okay. The lamb meatballs oozed goat cheese but the lamb itself was vey under seasoned and need salt. Safe to say we finished the lobster linguine and just picked at the lamb meat ball dish. We got the chai tea Creme brûlée dessert along with, by Stephanie's suggestion, a baileys and coffee with a bit of fransican, I think?  It was a hazelnut liquor from what I understand. Either way it was great. Stephanie also brought us house made marshmallows fluff for the coffee. Oh it was so good! The chai Creme brûlée was very tasty and a nice twist on the classic. We are already planning our trip back to check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give more stars... our server Josh was so pleasant and he was an awesome server who deserves 5 stars. This review is for the restaurant overall.... the ambiance outside is beautiful. Weather was great and they had umbrellas to protect us from the hot Vegas sun.

However, because of the food, I likely will not be back. I felt as if the menu didn't describe the food very well. I had to ask a lot of questions and even then, the food came out looking and tasting entirely different from what I had expected. I believe if they added more pictures it would be more pleasant. I can't remember if they had any pictures at all.

We ordered two types of pasta.... they were both salty and unflavorful. The chicken caprese was soooo salty. It was not Parmesan crusted at all. Just deep fried chicken to me. Overall the plate was bland and didn't wow me at all. 

The miso soup very salty... I've had many miso soup from Japanese restaurants and this one was very salty. 

The mini tiramisu was actually the best thing I ate today and we only got that because it came free from signing up for the loyalty card. 

We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a strange place and I'm don't want to give it one star because it's gorgeous, friendly service, but has a few odd things going on that I hope they fix.

Went for lunch today, it had like six people at tables, there were three of us.  We all got the same poke bowls.  It took literally about 30 minutes to get our food.

The food was absolutely delicious. But it was too small a portion for the value. For $13, we got a cup of rice and a 1.5 cups of vegetables. How much food cost could be in this dish. We left still hungry.

It was my friend's 4th time here and she warned me that the service would be terrible, not the waitress per se, but the kitchen. She always had to wait a very long time for food and today was no exception.

I would absolutely never return here because of the wait and the small portion.
The entire menu was way overpriced.
I'm not cheap, again, it's about value.
Today's lunch should have been $7."}
{"text":"Our friends made reservations at Crave because it was near our hotel. Beautiful atmosphere, and great service but the food was just ok. I had sushi, good but not great, the fish did not taste super fresh. The Chilean Sea bass was very good. We had to send the French fries back because they were soggy. The chicken stir fry was fair. I'm not sure I would go back for food maybe just drinks. They have some very interesting drinks on the menu. Our waitress was very patient with our group sending her back and forth several times"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my birthday. The atmosphere is almost as wonderful as the food! I ordered the lamb meatballs with a glass of red wine and they were delicious! The service was excellent. We very much enjoyed the company of our server, Jennifer. She was so sweet and attentive. My family and I will be back soon just for her outstanding service."}
{"text":"There are five things that I want to review my opinions upon this restaurant.
1. WELCOME- Hostess was very polite, giving us a 30min. Wait time since this is the only sit down restaurant that's open in downtown summerlin mall.
2. SETTING- Very nice furniture and lighting is amazing. It feels like walking into an Asian infused American restaurant, maroon and red and gold interior, you can tell by it's design that it's been very well thought through.
3. CUSTOMER SERVICE- From the hostess and the waitress, they have been extremely polite, taking our drink orders once we sat and our entree orders as well. Time is a precious matter and no matter how busy they were, they helped us at any chance they get.
4. FOOD- I ordered the aloha sushi roll and it was amazing, it had ginger and a sweet teriyaki sauce that meshed well with the raw tuna, my friend had the \"crave burger\" and it was cooked just right medium rare, and the French fries had a great seasoning not just plain. 
5. OVERALL REVIEW- Great setting, customer service and food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Disgusting... I'm completely appalled at how they let dogs feast on their plates and let them urinate in the patio. It was my 21st birthday and it was nice up until I was eating and suddenly lost my appetite after smelling this strong urine odor. The dogs had an accident and I told the waiter about it. He brought out the manager and she told us that the patio is pet friendly. If I knew they let pets defecate and urinate on their furniture I wouldn't sit outside... And if I knew they allow the pets to eat off the same plates they serve to customers I wouldn't order anything!!! The manager offered to move us, a party of 9, instead of telling the couple with the two dogs to move since we had the problem with the pets emptying their bowls. After she spoke to us she spoke to the couple with the pets and started to pet their dogs... 

That was just a slap on the face, how dare you have the audacity to tell me to move and then pet the dogs that just pissed under and around one of your tables. 
Bad management. Disgusting place. They try to be upscale but allow URINE. Even if it is outdoor seating it's still a restaurant. I've yet to come across another restaurant that allows the same thing to happen."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. It's ok. Not bad, but not amazing either. 

We've even been for one of their romantic dinner specials. Plenty of food, but still just ok flavors.

And the place is pricey! Their happy hour \"specials\"...pricey. 

It is a fun place to bring a group. The service is wonderful and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I had a bug in my plate and instead reduce it from my bill I still pay for that, disgusting place. Prison food more appealing than this place"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Had a drink spilled on me by the busser within 20 min."}
{"text":"Betty, one of the managers greeted us at our table after our party had waited a while for a server to come. We waited for around 10+ min to order drinks. Betty made it right by giving us excellent service for the rest of the evening.

I ordered the Mac & Cheese, something simple, and it was fantastic. Betty also brought an order of Lemon Garlic Wings to the table for us, and they were so good. It was such a nice flavor, I will most likely come back again for the wings."}
{"text":"The ratings seem to be ranking this place pretty average, but Crave is one of the better options at Downtown Summerlin. Prices are a pretty penny for what you get, but they offer specials like $50/couple Date Night entrees and wine, discounted sushi days, and such. They do offer an \"Under $10\" snack section that trends to small and disappointing, but I guess it's the thought that's supposed to count.

LEMON GARLIC WINGS: I'll start with the positive menu items. Hot damn these were good! Fragrant with garlic, flavorful and crispy, and served as the full wing rather than just the drumstick as elsewhere. Even the bleu cheese dipping sauce, while totally unnecessary because the chicken itself was delicious, was good.
CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP: This was tasty, decent amount of meat combined with a \"lemony mayo\" that gave it a bit more flavor than other versions. Served with thin triangles of flatbread, but we mostly at it with the aforementioned tortilla chips. Though there was crab in this dip, there wasn't much in the way of artichoke, surprisingly. $15 for a small, shareable appetizer portion.
CHIPS & GUAC/PICO: Chips with guac and chips with pico are both listed on the \"snacks\" section, and they're fine. Portion is small to match the $5 price tag. Guac was fresh, pico was boring and bland. Having a solid house salsa would be a better option.
NEGIHAMA ROLL: Simple maki-style roll with a white fish, seasoned with some green onion and a hint of ponzu. Fresh and tasty, if a bit on the boring side. Can't really argue with the $5 price, kind of hits the spot if you're craving sushi but don't want to do a full meal of it.

Service was lackluster: initially walked in to an unmanned hostess stand, as we debated whether to dine elsewhere, she returned and told us to seat ourselves if we were going to be in the bar area. 15 minutes later, no one had acknowledged us so we went back to the hostess to receive an actual table. She didn't seem surprised or apologetic, so this may be the norm. Server was less than efficient and not particularly personable. 

As other reviews have stated, the menu is all over the place with apps, pastas, burgers, fish dishes, and sushi, leading to a 'jack of all trades, master of none' feeling. Despite sampling a few different types of dishes, I can't honestly say there's one they do best. Will likely be coming back to try their date night or sushi specials. 

NOTE: For those with Celiac disease, they do offer a dedicated GF menu that isn't as sparse or boring as other places."}
{"text":"Updating my review. It really says a lot when management calls to make things right.  

It started right when I received a message on Yelp from my previous post.   Most people just roll their eyes or just ignore a negative comment but these guys didn't.  Leah, thanks for your message and Kevin, thanks for your call. 

I will keep all my positives as mentioned previously. 
Food is consistent. You order the same thing a month later, the taste is the same. It's great

Lots of variety to please everybody's pallet.  Good food and reasonable cost. 

Service from waiters are excellent. I have enjoyed all my waiters and I've been there about a dozen times.  I continue to come back with my clients almost monthly. 

And finally I'm going to give them a 5 Star for their efforts in making things right.  Very much Appreciated. Thanks Crave."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time going here and we came with another couple. We expected this place to be amazing and to our disappointment it wasn't. When we got there we had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Even though you can clearly see many tables open. The service wasn't great but wasn't bad either. The server took a while to refill our drinks. When I clearly saw them just talking and messing with each other. 

The restaurant itself was nice and lively. The decor was simple but vibrant. The staff wasn't very approachable. They were stern and not friendly. 

The food here is over priced for the quality and portion. I ordered the Steak Slider and my friend ordered the Pork Belly Slider both came with 3 sliders each. The size of each slider was probably 2x2 inches. It was not filling unless you went there not hungry. My Steak Slider was slightly tough so I'm guessing they used a flank steak for it. The only thing that was good with my order was the pickled jalapeño. My boyfriend ordered the Grilled Bistro Steak. That was not worth $30. There was like 8 pieces of steak that did not have flavor what so ever. Even steak on it's own has flavor and that did not. My friend's boyfriend got the Bison Burger. That was cooked well but for the kind of restaurant they made the place seem to be they use the cheapest type of lettuce for the burger. Anything else would have been better than what they used with it. 
We for sure will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place. The drink specials were outstanding (see Becka (sp) the daytime bartender). She makes some of the best (strongest) drinks I've had in a while. They have a good happy hour and bottomless mimosas for 11bucks as well. The food was outstanding! Try the braised short rib hash. A must do. This is now our go to brunch spot. No reason not to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here and definitely will not come back. A large party sat 10-15 minutes after us and got served first. When we finally got served, about 30 minutes after we ordered, my husband's burger was luke warm and the fries were almost cold. My salad came out wrong and I had to wait for them to redo it. They didn't offer us anything as an apology and charged us for the full meal. Oh and there was next to nobody in the restaurant so no excuse for how long we waited for our food."}
{"text":"Wow---the crave burger reminds me why I can never be a vegetarian---juicy flavor---perfection!   Clean-excellent service--nice music too--great atmosphere!  Lunch time crowd easier seating than evenings--great choice!"}
{"text":"Today we ordered the torrontes white wine and salmon with avocado roll and came out delicious. Our server was Bryan and he was very nice and suggested things to us with a great attitude. He came around very often and would suggest asking for his section when coming. Come on a Saturday do you can enjoy the great music too!"}
{"text":"We found this place and saw that they offered free meals to kids on certain days so we instantly got attracted to it. Any kid friendly restaurant and advertises for it is a plus for us. 
When we walked in, the hostess was chatting with other guests, the wait was five mins... My husband had to speak to the bar tender to find out if we can just seat ourselves, we actually almost left. After being seated, the server ( petite with orange hair - Saturday shift at 7:30p ) approached to get our drinks and gave our little one his activity stuff. She looked very tired but still attentive, mediocre - not friendly or entertaining, just there to fill a shift. Food came after about 15mins since we wanted it all together. My miso soup was not even warm so I asked to replace with \"hot\" miso soup. The server seemed very apologetic, (she was very attentive the entire time) and got another one. Whoever the cook was ( cant call that chef ) seemed to just have poured boiling hot water on the soup. It tasted like hot water with a minuscule hint of miso so I returned it after I asked both my son and hubby if they wanted it ( they both said yuck ). 

The rolls we ordered were alright, nothing I will come back too .. The last roll was loose, the cooks lack pride in making them. 
I have tried better and more artistic seaweed salad before. The only good taste was the steak but my hubby ended up with stomach pains and major bathroom breaks after. They need to be wiser in choosing chefs because it can definitely make or break you.   

Restaurant was clean, bathroom had broken seat cover holders.. Seemed like someone yanked it. I love the chandelier in the bathroom though. Place seemed empty for a Saturday. I don't think this place will last unless it is turned around because location is great and there is potential."}
{"text":"This review is for everything you look for in a restaurant.  We came for dinner.  Seated immediately.  Place is big, clean, decorated trendy.  Not loud.  Friendly server.  Drinks - pear martinis - perfect pour, delicious.  Drinks came out quick.  We each ordered a Poke bowl.  One traditional, one Mexican.  So tasty, light, healthy.  They say these are for a limited time - I hope they keep them on the menu.  Food came out quick.  And we each got a dessert - coconut cake and the french silk mousse.  What I love about this place - nice size portions.  No gluttonous, over sized dishes.  Go the strip and eat like a pig there.  Every restaurant here doesn't have to be VEGAS SIZED.  Perfect size portions. You don't need a doggy bag to go.   It's a great place.  Want to go back and try Happy Hour at the bar next. :)   What more can you ask for at a restaurant?  Service, prices, food, drink.  All A+."}
{"text":"This place should be called \"Brave\".  You'd need to be to want to go back.

Where to begin? We got to the restaurant Friday evening just after 7:30.  Despite seeing several tables available, I was asked if I had a reservation.  Nope.  So when I was told it would be a 45-60 minute wait because I didn't have one, I hopped on OpenTable and made a rez for 7:45.

\"Yes\", I said.  \"I have a reservation for 7:45.\"

The hostess got huffy and went and got a manager.  I explained that I went on OpenTable and made my rez after I was told there would be a 45-60 minute wait.  I played by their rules, and the millennial hostess decided to get upset.  \"After all, the restaurant is 1/2 empty. A potential hour wait seems a little absurd\", I observed.

The manager protested that his place was half empty (it turned out to be more than that). But I remained cool headed and just told him to seat me after he seated everyone else waiting (there was nobody waiting).

My gf and I eventually were seated.  I am 100% certain that the manager decided to mess with me because every single dish came out of the kitchen wrong.  The salad had no goat cheese and was overly slimy.  When I mentioned it, I was given a tiny cup on the side rather than re-making the slimy salad.  The Mac and cheese was under seasoned, my gf's sushi was hastily strewn about the plate, it took 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and the first brownie desert we got was so overcooked and burnt it couldn't be cut.

I'm SO glad I ordered the extra spit.  (I'm nearly certain, though have no proof.)

Anyhow, we were there on a $100 gift card and since I will never go back, I tipped the waiter the $25 of change I could have gotten back.  He did fine, it's really too bad his manager and hostess were such clowns.

If I could shut this place down, I would.

Pro tip: Avoid it."}
{"text":"CRAVE SUCKED PERIOD. Service was good, food not so much. I had juicier fish from McDonalds and the steak was dried no where near medium rare and both that and the plain mash was cold and the drinks were horrible. I hate hate hate giving bad reviews and I haven't in a LONNNNNNG TIME but I really have to warn everyone for the money I would've gotten the same quality, taste and maybe more enjoyable food at Denny's for 3 times less. Sorry to be so harsh but I was genuinely disappointed. It was so busy and I can't wrap my brain around why because there was nothing good about the food here. If the food didn't come out as quick as it did I would've been livid! Even my 4 and 2 year old op to avoid their free mac and cheese and pizza (thank god they were free) because I mean they hardly even touched their fries. I normally obsessively research good places to eat and this time I didn't and I truly wished I did. This was a classic case of Looks Good, Sounds Good, Smells Good but the total opposite of Good! Like others I too am a bit confused at where they were going with their concept I mean I get something for everyone's craving but trust me there's nothing here that I'll CRAVE again! 

So needless to it's a never again for me, such a flop. Total pass! 

P.S. Check out the garnish in my old Fashion that's pictured...looks like it was from a chop shop smh casual semi-fine dinning embarrassment if you ask me. I think I've had better Old Fashion all around better looking better tasting at an airport. It was just bad, everything about it was just bad. Also have you hear of a strainer, in the picture my wife got the martini thing which had pepper flakes floating all up in it. The name of the drink wasn't a disaster it was just a complete disaster. 

The sad part is the resturant and the people there are so nice and I've said this before sometimes if the food isn't all that great but the service is, it makes all the difference but the food experience was so ugh at Crave that it trumps the service this time around."}
{"text":"I always get the Scottish salmon and it's very tasty. Good sauce and the carrots are awesome"}
{"text":"This place is another sad case of a confused restaurant who, in trying too hard to be innovative and sexy with flavor pairings, and trying to catch all the food trends, has achieved nothing but mediocrity. Not to mention that for the same prices I can get the real gourmet version of what they are trying to do at a strip restaurant. My Mahi Mahi was over cooked , and had a bizzare banana and curry sauce. The sushi roll we had was edible...if you are the type that likes American AYCE places. The best thing was the burger, which was ok, but for $17 I expected better grade beef and more interesting bun. The service was good. I liked the waitress but In the end, I don't think I would come back. Too many other better places to spend $100 on dinner for 2."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was very satisfied with my experience. The food was so delicious and the service was outstanding! Our waiters name was Jordan. He did an amazing job. I will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"These guys are lost.  Whoever trained this staff needs to be trained themselves.   We stood out front of hostess desk and told three people our name and reservation time.  3 different times they asked who we were.   At 715, 20 minutes later the ask a 4th time and say \"ohh we have been waiting on you\". I said we have been standing here for 25 minutes.   She replies. \"Did u get lost, the place is hard to find\".  I looked at her and said her and said ...I just told you we have been here 25  minutes.    OMG.   Ok now at dinner.   Ran out of kids cups crayons.    40 minutes now no salad.    Salads now have come but mine is missing.  I'm not going to say anything cause I want the torture to end    I should also state.   They are not even busy.       It's a thur night   Here is the deal.  I lived here for 20
Years.  If this place near strip it may survive. But up in Summerlin. I give it 18 months and their gone.      Food was average"}
{"text":"So we tried out Crave last night, and since it's new, we weren't expecting perfection. We made a reservation, so we didn't have to wait. We were seated and  promptly greeted and our drink order was taken. When we did order, our waiter (Michael B, who was great) did let us know the kitchen was running slow, and yes we did wait about a half hour for our food....but the food was amazing! I got the mac and cheese with chicken apple sausage, that was soooo yummy! My friend got the scallops which he said was great ( I'm not a seafood fan). The best part was dessert. We got the coconut cake and the walnut praline cheesecake. OMG the coconut cake was the best I ever tasted! I'm still craving it lol! So please don't be put off by the bad reviews and the long waits. This place is a winner and a welcomed addition to Summerlin."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The poke stack yes the salmon yes and thank you The bread pudding hot damn"}
{"text":"Meal was really good.  So many things on the menu I wanted to try so I'll be back soon.  All of my dishes were really good.  I tried the popcorn shrimp, yellowtail and Philly roll."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but the service is hit and miss.  It's glacially slow and rude at times, while other times friendly and attentive.  I've come here at all different times, different days, both alone and with friends and keep finding the service to be inconsistent.  
I will give high marks to a waitress named Cassie, as she is always kind and attentive.  However, she's obviously not always there, or there's not always an open spot in her section.
My favorite dishes are the sushi and sashimi, along with the steak frites.  The food and wine specials are always good.  The Hess Shirt Tail is one of the best Sauvignon Blancs I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and I must disagree with a lot of the reviews. 

Service was spot-on. Waitress was great and very attentive. Refills for drinks constantly. 

Love the decor, environment, the total vibe. I feel really bad that so many people reviewed based on a brand new establishment and not giving them credit for just opening. 

Food was good: the bbq pork sliders with kimchi was tender and juicy. The chicken apple and brie sandwich was bomb. Such a unique flavor. 

Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"From the service, to the food, everything was fantastic!

We started off with the crab cakes for an appetizer along with the Godzilla roll. Crab cakes were fantastic! Sushi roll was 20$ but a fairly larger portion.

 I got the mahi mahi. It was to die for! A burst of flavor! It had hints of pecan and cinnamon on a bed of shrimp rice. My friend got the apple sandwich that came on pita. Very good, great for a tasty lunch. 

We finished off with The tiramisu shooter, and the chocolate cake. 

Everything was excellent! We will definitely be back next time we spend our day in dt summerlin!"}
{"text":"REQUEST NICHOLAS as your server! he's amazing. so personable, and provides exceptional customer service. the food was great, the patio was beautiful and more than welcoming of our golden retriever who accompanied us, but it will be Nicholas who makes us come back. :) thanks nick! thanks crave!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The location and patio have a great atmosphere. However, the food left a LOT to be desired. We ordered off of the happy hour menu and we were displeased with every item that we ordered. We decided that since it was the happy hour menu it may be sub par. So we ordered a sushi roll off of the regular menu and it was the worst one! Like I said again great service, great location, terrible food and presentation. My fiancé order a glass of wine and the glass was filthy. I don't think this restaurant specializes in sushi. All of the rolls were rolled terribly and falling apart by the time they reached our table. We won't be going again."}
{"text":"Not what I would expect for the prices, but not awful either. Sunday afternoon, not busy. We started with one server and then another showed up and relieved the first. Had to tell the second what our drink order was. Thought she could've asked the first server. Kale salad was pretty good. Bistro grilled steak had garlic butter over it which I thought was different. It was ok. The steak was cooked right but I felt like I spent a lot of time chewing, more than normal! I left two medallions as I just couldn't chew anymore. Pureed potatoes were fine, nothing special. The grilled, burnt brussel sprouts were not the best, though I ate half for the nutritional value. The candied carrot drink was different and ok. Again, ordered that for the carrot juice nutrient.
The server came to the table a few too many times and always when I was chewing. Give it a rest after your first check on the food stop by. Just keep an eye on drinks. I may go back once more for another item. Husband enjoyed his sushi."}
{"text":"I came by Crave for the first time and upon dining here realized it's a chain restaurant. The menu has a lot of enticing options for one which is a plus! This location in Downtown Summerlin in Vegas is very nice from the outside and inside with modern decor and a spacious and nice ambiance. 

I opted for a Half Sandwich of Chicken, Apple & Brie which comes with a salad, cup of soup or fries.. and I opted for fries. The sandwich was delicious, but a little bit messy from the Citrus Vinagrette.. but nonetheless enjoyable with the soft Tandoori Nan Bread along with Arugula and Rosemary Aioli. I also asked for a side of aioli for my fries which was perfect with the yummy fries. The server was great, tasty food, a little pricey for the food though, but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor seating.... But their wasn't any available servers to seat us for the outdoors...area... We agreed to a window seat inside and waited at least 20 minutes for any acknowledgment...very poor service...flatbread pizza was average...chicken tender were above average...lemon garlic wings were Delish...would probably not dine  here again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great night at Crave! 
They had a pre-opening night, as their official opening is tonight. 

The place is very pretty with a clean, well designed, modern feel.  Nice little outside seating area overlooking the beautiful downtown Sunmerlin mall landscape. Our bartender Chris was outstanding!  His Cosmos are made just right with a hint of a blush, not too much. We decided to call them Christini's as they are done so perfectly, grouping them in with run of the mill Cosmos seems wrong. Lol. 
We requested our favorite Alien Tequila, & hopefully they will have it very soon. 

The staff and servers were very nice & doing their best to give 5 star service.... getting everything out on time.   The food all tasted great... Medium rare came out perfectly for both the burger and the steak. The chicken was moist and tasty. The pork tenderloin  was very nice and Sea Bass was excellent.  Asian noodles were Flavorful & not too hot.  The Geisha-boat is a large Sushi boat and is stunning & the portion is very generous.  The sushi is a little spicy, but in a good way.  

Deserts were Amazing!  The chocolate cake is not a sweet milk chocolate... It is a dark chocolate lovers desert.  Tiramisu is Fabulous!! Those two deserts were the highlights with our group. 

The General Manager, Ryun Chastain was very nice... He has an impressive resume, including s long stint at Wolfgang Puck & he is very observant & service oriented. He came over to chat & check on everything. 

Great New Reataurant with an upbeat vibe & really nice quality food."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we've been here (closer to 10 if you count the times I've been to the one in Cincy), and the service/food just keeps getting worse.

Today, we had the jumbo shrimp for an appetizer. Mike had steak sliders, and I ordered the bison burger. 

First, they didn't even get Mike's coke right. The shrimp was pretty good, but it took a while for a starter. 

The chef spent most of his time chatting with his friends at the next table about a party at Brooklyn Bowl. 

When our entrees (finally) arrived, I took a few bites. The second bite was a mouthful of chewy undercooked pork fat. I was done. I searched for our server, but since the chef was at the next table, I told him to send the server over, because I was done. 

When the server took the burger away, I told him the pork belly was raw. The chef said, \"let me see that\" under his breath. 

I'm sure he was going to say it was fine. He probably doesn't realize that Crave isn't the only place in Vegas that serves pork belly. 

The manager came over and apologized for the burger, and said she took it off the bill. I told her, \"of course you did, I didn't eat it.\"  

The management, should work on their service standards and service recovery, because there are literally thousands of restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Originally went to Public House, but it was a long wait so we stumbled upon Crave. It wasn't busy at all. The host greeted us (4) and continued finishing up whatever she was doing before we walked in, which kind of bugged me. We waited for about 2 min before she grabbed our menus and escorted us to our booth. Mind you, there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. We were the first guests of the day I assuming. We shouldn't have waited at all. We got seated and immediately our server greeted us and asked if we've been here before which we haven't. And began to give us a quick run down of the restaurant and menu. He was great. As soon as we ordered our food started to come in quick one by one. Also ordered a mimosa which only tasted the Orange juice. The appetizers were great (tuna poke) and the jalapeño poppers were delicious. When we got our entrees my husband ordered the béarnaise burger and I ordered grilled cheese with tomato soup. Mine turned out great (but who can mess up grilled cheese) as soon as my husband was about to take a bite from his burger our server mentioned that it was the wrong burger. He was served the Bison burger instead of the béarnaise. He apologized and offered to get him his original burger but my husband was fine with the bison burger. Which he said was really good. So no complaints. The manager even came to apologize about the mix up. When we got our bill nothing was even deducted for THEIR mistake. I mean the least they could do for their mistake on a slow day was take off a few dollars. But hey that's my opinion. All in all the food was good, the restaurant was nice and our server was great. I probably won't ever come back."}
{"text":"When can a steakhouse be great and great sushi? When it's Crave!  Great filet mignon, delicious tomato basil soup! Husband got sushi and it was delish!!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The only thing that could have made the food worse was if there was a hair, nail, or tooth found in it.  1 stars for the service and by that I mean our server who did not prepare or cook our meal. 

Only a few other tables occupied and one person at the bar when we were seated at 5:30. Took 20min+ just to get our waters and beer. Server was pleasant. 

Orders: artichoke dip, seafood paella and scallops and shrimp pasta....oh and the caprese flatbread after I sent my dish back. 

Artichoke dip was so salty and grainy and there were artichoke pieces that we had to pull out of our mouths and put aside because they were not masticate-able. We couldn't chew through them. The pool of oil on top was a nice soaking haven for the bread. 
Focaccia bread was decent, but served cold. 

Scallops and shrimp pasta has 3 tiny, rubbery, frozen scallops in it. Tasted half of one. Didn't even try the shrimp because after tasting the pasta, it would have been a moot point. There was no flavor of \"lobster cream sauce\", or anything honestly. Even lemon would have come through and I would h ave doused it if I had lemon. It was mushy and cooked poorly and the sauce tasted like nothing more than a pasty roux of flour,salt, and water. They didn't even cook the flour enough to burn of that pasty taste. 

Paella was a joke too...served on a plate at about a cull and a half size mound. Rice and protein included. Was NOT any version of paella I've ever tried. It was a best, an undercooked,  bland version of risotto. The rice in the dish never even saw an iron pan. Mushy on the outside and rock hard grain on the inside. And two pieces each of the assorted seafood that weren't even mentionable enough to remember...shrimp, mussels , frozen scallops? Maybe some fish? 

I sent my shrimp and scallops pasta back and ordered a caprese flatbread. Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic vinegar, right? 
NO. No basil and there was arugula instead. Lots of balsamic reduction which was over powering, flavorless tomatoes like little slugs, and it was not any cheese worthy of being served as a caprese style dish. It was low moisture, skim, mozzarella. I wouldn't be surprised it the cheese came to them already shredded in bags. Gross. I had one piece and was done. 

This places touts itself to a much higher standard than it actually delivers while still charging the prices it thinks it can get for the food they claim to serve. 

Oh and I just received a coupon in the bulk mail for buy one get one entree there. If you want it, send me a message and I'll gladly give it to you."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now. Seems that the food and service are hit and miss. The dishes are tasty and the menu has a great selection. Ambiance is great. However I went for lunch and the food was just OK - some great some had to be sent back. The restaurant was dirty (especially the floor - looked like it hadn't been swept or vacuumed in a week). Beer was a little pricey for the quality of place. Overall I'd try somewhere else first and use this as a backup. Good concept, not so great execution."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner a few weeks ago with another couple and everything from the time we get their was poor--they sat us 20 minutes late, everything that all of us ordered wasn't good, the atmosphere feels like a chain and there are many other places on DT Summerlin to eat at."}
{"text":"Hi
My wife and I come to your store often on are days off .  We love the food and happy hour pricing .  We lately have been getting loyalty night emails and thought we would stop by .  We didn't RSVP because we have item off your menu we like .  We came in around 320, talked to barmaid that we have seen before .  The store was empty, a couple of duces and 4 to 6 people for the free stuff.  Seemed like there was enough staff to handle far more business then you had but everyone was preoccupied with the set up for the loyalty event .  Food took far to long to come out given business level , I'm sure you had a pantry person and Sous chef setting up for party and my ticket got overlooked .  We decided to leave and paid for the 1 beer we ordered .  The food  then came out , \" no thanks \". Barmaid walked up to manager ( guy , late 40 mid 50s) then returned to offer food for free, again \"no thanks \" she went back to manager spoke to him as we waited for our change .  He never attempted to approach us at all and he was 10 feet away .  

I've been an F+B director as well as manager for many store in strip hotel , owned (;:/-/: cafe for 10 years on the strip My wife is a manager on the strip , her store does 15 million a years .........bottom line you dropped the ball during a locals appreciation night .  Kitchen took to long , staff didn't check ticket time and worst of all the manager did not handle the issue himself , he thought free food was the way to our hearts ......WRONG!!  Tighten up , worst mistakes happen when your slow and not paying attention .

{"text":"We come every Sunday's since it's opened and I never get sick of it, service is great and the food is even better, love Crave"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and welcoming restaurant. Craig was our server and he was awesome. Started off with truffle fries, buffalo wings and a couple pieces of yellow fin. My dad's dynamite role was \"the best ever\" but my steak was way over cooked. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"While the food was decent overall, and the waitress made sure to check in on is..... That is about where the good remarks end. Our two kids (party of 7) both had chicken fingers. Our daughters came out 5 minutes after the adults food. Our sons took an additional five minutes to come out (he's 2 and not very patient...), and when I cut into one of the fingers, it was raw! We had to send it back and wait an additional 10 minutes (by this time everyone else was done with their meal). My husbands chicken wings (ordered lemon garlic, only 2 of hem were lemon. The remaining were buffalo. Oh, and on holidays.... Kids don't eat free, which should have been disclosed at the beginning of the meal, not after we received the check. Nothing was offered for the mistakes and the raw chicken I almost fed my toddler."}
{"text":"At first we went, everything was perfect. The food was delicious, or so we thought, everything went well. The waitress messed up our orders but it was ok, not a big deal. We had to pay for bread which was kinda strange but again, not a big deal. Dinner went well and everything was alright. It's what's in the food that I question. My boyfriend and I and his parents we to eat there, we all ordered different things but idk something in the food have ALL FOUR of us diarrhea and tummy aches.  Boyfriend and I have been on the toilet for two days now along with his parents. This is really sketchy, I don't know how they did or what they did in the kitchen but I'm definitely never coming back. Awful explosive diarrhea and stomach aches. Spent $170 there just to get sick after. Very disappointed, I had really high expectations."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best burger we've had in Las Vegas. 702 burger or the Crave burger were both top notch. Amazing flavor combinations well presented. Scottish  Salmon was well worth it. Fresh and not fishy tasting. They claim it actually comes from Scottish waters. Our experience was 5 star worthy. Waitstaff was good, attentive and knowledgable. We will be back. I don't say that often in this town. I'm not sure why this place gets only 3 stars on yelp. Our experience was a solid 4.5. Will be back later this month to see if they are consistent."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mother's Day special and everything came out all at once including the salads that they actually forgot. The steaks and potatoes were cold and missing items we requested. The manager never once apologized but actually argued with me. They brought us new plates while we ate poorly made salads and the food was correct this time and tasted good. The server never came back except to clear the dishes and drop off the bill. She also never apologized for the mistakes and after we complained initially, had quite the attitude. When we received the bill, the specials were removed and again neither the manager or server said anything. We paid the remaining and tipped the server off of what the bill should've been even though she didn't deserve a dime. It's a shame because once corrected, the food was good but after that kind of service, never again. I didn't want it free. I wanted it corrected with a genuine apology. I wanted customer service and a good meal. Apparently you can't get those at CRAVE. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Crave several times. They have a huge menu with something for everybody. And the food is really great. However, I have had the worst service every time. The servers are a little scatter brained and have messed up my orders/ forgotten to bring the check and the kitchen took forever to get the food out. It's always been a hot mess. Two and a half hours in a restaurant for a salad and some hummus is just too much. Its a bummer because their food really kept me coming back until I realized that their bad service was the norm and not a fluke. I suggest that you skip this place and go to Public School instead."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch two days ago. There were four of us in our party. I had read all the yelp reviews, which were not stellar, so my expectations were not over-the-top! I was totally impressed with the staff. I think most of these bad reviews happened the first week of their grand opening. IMHO they definitely got their act together. The hostess was gracious and welcoming. Our server was very experienced patient and very well-informed about the restaurant's offerings. We sat very near the sushi bar. I am not a sushi fan. I had read some of the reviews that said that the restaurant smelled like sushi. I have a very sensitive nose and could smell nothing adverse. I had my first bison burger; it was moist , had an appealing sauce and the taste was wonderful! Another person had the chopped salad and said that she would have it again (It looked excellent. Another person had their normal burger and she loved it! The fourth person had some sort of chicken pita wrap. I am sorry that I can't remember what was in it, but she loved it. The pita bread basket is to die for! They serve it with oil infused with oregano and other spices. I could not stop eating it!we also had the tomato basil soup. Three out of four of us loved it. The fourth person thought that it had a bit too much lemon in it. I thought that the prices were extremely reasonable. I will be back. We were seated immediately and he had a thoroughly enjoyable time there. I almost forgot: the french fries that come with the burgers are addictive! Fries came with my bison burger, but the server suggested ordering a large order of fries for the table. All four of us love the fries! They were obviously deep fried in very good oil! We were too full for dessert! One thing that impressed me, is that they have gluten-free options on their menu. I will be coming back with my cousin who has gluten issues. I gave the review 4-stars and am thinking of changing it to 5- stars. Again, kudos to the ENTIRE staff. VERY impressed!"}
{"text":"While I don't eat sushi, I am always on the hunt  for a delicious burger. I am stoked to say that Crave's 702 burger lived up to it's reputation. The diverse menu is nice and the decor is cool to look at. Their avocado egg rolls blew Cheesecake factories right out of the water. This might be added to list for one of our regular joints to swing by."}
{"text":"Food average & tastless, bartender must not if ever tended bar before didn't know drinks or food and made several immature comments. Prepare to wait for food & service even though place is empty?"}
{"text":"Came here for my mother in laws birthday and I am so mad that we did! She deserved to have a better birthday dinner. First of all when we got to the restaurant, the reservation was not in the system that I know we made. Then after they hurried to accommodate our reservation it took them over 20-30mins to come and take our order for DRINKS. Not only did it take them 20-30 mins to come order drinks, right after one waiter came another one came to take our drinks again. Really unorganized. Then it took about another 20-30 mins to come take our food order. My mother in law and her friend both ordered their house salad, and substituted the blue cheese with ranch. When the salad came out it had blue cheese on it, so they kindly asked if they could send it back to the kitchen and have it remade with the ranch how they originally ordered it. It came out after we had already ate our entrees, with ranch dressing with blue cheese crumbles on it still.. you would think if they're subbing the blue cheese for ranch they would take off the blue cheese crumbles as well. At this point we just had them sent back to the kitchen since we had already finished eating everything else. The entrees were very very bland, and over priced. Which was disappointing considering my pasta looked amazing but had no flavor what so ever and my husbands shrimp and lobster mac and cheese was extremely dry. They did give her a free dessert for her birthday, which was a nice gesture. She had got the s'mores brownie for dessert and even the brownie was bland. How do you mess up a BROWNIE???? Really bad experience, and will not be returning to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well let's just say disappoint across the board . I have eaten there before but decided to give it one more try after attending a happy hour with decent appetizers . We first started out with a few appetizers before dinner , the chicken wings , Korean chicken bites,  pork dumplings and sushi tempura bites . The only thing I woukd order again was the pork dumplings. Lunch , me and my gf ordered the short rib hash , I ordered everything extra crispy with runny eggs on top , my friend ordered the same but hard fried eggs , the order came out completely wrong , my daughter ordered the bison burger , not only did the whole plate come out cold the bun was frozen,  manager came and asked if she wanted another or something else , she then ordered a sushi roll at 16.95 I'm thinking this better be an amazing roll , hardly the case not only did it fall apart it was small and tasteless. My friends daughter ordered the chicken sandwich which she said was ok and was only order that came out right but was cold too. I didn't even mention the service our waitress just seemed irritated the whole time serving us , enough so I mentioned it to the manager , she seemed to care but not really.  I'm not even sure how they stay in business , good is sub par and so is the service , for the prices I would much rather take my business somewhere else.  However they did take 20% off out bill for all the inconvenience.  I still do not wish to return again I wish they could get it together because it's a great location ."}
{"text":"Second time was way better than fi.We ate 702 burger is different than regular burger egg on it but worth to try my girlfriend was crazy about that burger.And sushi was fresh and tasty.You should try calamary with parmesan so good.Our server helped us for meals."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just hit this place on an off night or what, but I will not be going back.
Once we were seated the waitress came to the table and it was immediately obvious that she had zero interest in being there. She took our drink order, came back with the drinks, took our order and then disappeared. We literally did not see her again. Given the attitude she may have just gone in the back and quit. 

Anyway, we ordered the calamari for our appetizer, considering the place was almost empty it took a completely unreasonable amount of time for it to come out, and when the sous chef finally did bring it to us it was cold. 

I ordered the Surfer roll and the Crunchy Heat roll - Both tasted like the the dishwasher had picked them up at 7 11 on his way into work. My girlfriend ordered the Sea Bass, which was delicious. But she isn't writing this review, I am. 

Considering all of the restaurants in that area, I can't see how you couldn't do better picking any place other than Crave."}
{"text":"Totally agreeing with Debby W.   Despite the usual goings-on with grand openings, you realize pretty quickly that this place is the new hot spot -- And that's just going by the diinner menu alone.  Two sides, equally phenomenal choices depending on your mood.  A larger-than-life Chicken Apple Sausage Flatbread went to the husband last night.  For me, sushi all around.  A new favorite (and everybody was ordering it) -- Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi followed excitedly by the Godzilla and Bamboo Bites specialty rolls.  Generous, fresh, delicious portions, adding new twists and flavors.  For dessert -- Crab Cakes!  They came late (kitchen was hustling!) but well worth the wait.  For the Ladies -- Pair this with an Angry Dragon Cocktail, and you're night is set.  Still talking about that drink this morning!  Great staff and great management with a hip but down-to-earth feel.  New place for date nights and after-work gatherings for sure on a regular basis.  Downtown Summerlin hit the mark on this one."}
{"text":"There are some extremely harsh reviews compared to the experience I had.

We chopped up Aloha roll, scallop poppers, chicken sausage mac 'n cheese, a bread basket, & a tiramisu just power it down style.  Everything was above average.  I was amazed at how respectable their sushi was when they are also serving up standard food.  I don't know if I would necessarily come for just the sushi, but if you are \"craving\" a feastival it makes some sense.  The desserts stood out enough on their own that I could see coming back and firing on the $20 sampler.

My server was spot on the whole time with no delays.  Almost had a \"white table cloth\" kind of experience combined with your casual bar.  Big comfortable booths and ample outdoor seating.

I would edge to a five before I would click a three, but expect a bit more uniqueness / less of a chain feel to get the full five.  Definitely will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Great experience!!! Service was superb! We loved the layout of the restaurant, there was plenty of space between tables and booths which made it seem more private and spacious. The decor was exquisite and impressive! Beautiful! The menu was really nice, with great choices in each category! The red curry pumpkin ravioli soup was absolutely amazing!!!! From flavor to consistency it was delicious!!! I had the chicken apple brie sandwich, which was really delectable! The combination of all the ingredients made for a really interestingly delicious flavor that I was thoroughly impressed by!!! I definitely want to come here again and try more selections!! 5 stars by far!!!"}
{"text":"Overall experience was not memorable. Took over an hour to get seated. After being seated took about 25 minutes to get my drink. Ordered Sweet Peach Ice Tea. Waiter kept coming back to table saying the bar was making it. About 4 trips. Finally after another 16 mins she said that they ran out. This place sells sushi but not that great. Food wait times are horrible. While I must say that the place looks fabulous and upscale, the presentation of food is below par. Sushi wait times are bad for a place that claims that has a sushi bar. The only thing I liked was that it was family friendly."}
{"text":"Couldn't get seating outside. Very nice restaurant. Chairs were too high and uncomfortable. Waited 20 minutes to be served but our waiter was very nice. Got the lemon pepper wings they were excellent. Flat bread pizza was also tasty."}
{"text":"Reservation for easter brunch. Limited selection for brunch. No kid breakfast items available. Pancakes were undercooked. Waited over 30 minutes to get check. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been to Crave on many occasions. I have never had a bad experience. Whether I was eating dinner at a table or hanging out by the bar for happy hour. Beautiful facility, great food and drinks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My Father and I can be very difficult to please, him kinda more so.  I was hoping for a good experience taking him to Crave, and I'm happy to report they killed it!

We were greeted by a lovely young lady and seated promptly. Our server, Becca, was really terrific. Patient, friendly, and knowledgeable, we both order the steak frittes (steak medallions, asparagus spears, and fries.  It was absolutely delicious! Arrived hot and well plated. Generous amount of everything.

If my Father says \"I'd come back here, you know it's gotta be good! Thanks Becca!"}
{"text":"Barely average and overpriced....two of us ordered the chopped chicken salad for lunch which sounded great on paper---chicken, bacon,  dried cherries, almonds, fontina cheese, avocado, etc.  We were served an exceptionally unappealing small mound of gray, barely seasoned chopped items that all shared an odd flavor that neither of us could figure out. We decided the wet, bland, shredded chicken may have been slightly \"off\" and left after two bites & paying our bill.  Our fault for deciding the 20 minute wait for a table at another restaurant located right above Crave was too long.  Our first clue that something wasn't right should have been all the empty tables during what should be a busy lunch hour on a Saturday afternoon.  Too bad, too. The interior is lovely and the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"Two weeks in & the place is still struggling with being new. Still not enough wait staff to support the place, as many tables were still empty on Friday night. The wait is still ridiculous (45 min for 2 people & we got there at 5:15). But it's still the only fancy-ish restaurant open yet. And the place is LOUD, like Red Robin loud. And no toilet seat covers...? What is this Europe? But the service was great, the rib eye was delicious, the potatoes were bland & the brussel sprouts were OK (they could use some bacon). The mini desserts were the best part. I'd go back, maybe months from now when they get their act together. PS. Watch your children people, those cactus out front are real!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, based on the reviews, I was apprehensive when my friend suggested Crave before shopping... I was either going to dig it or detest it. Bearing in mind we got there at 11:30, we were ahead of any rush. Nice enough weather to sit outside where they have lots of umbrellas for those who don't enjoy direct sunlight dining. Before moving on, I will say that the hostesses were quite friendly but I hate how they dress! I think there's a red/black dress code- which I'm on board with- but the women (more like girls) looked like they belonged at a club, not a restaurant at a mall in Summerlin in the afternoon. Our waiter was adorable & on his game. We started with the bread assortment with fragrant olive oil... we loved every bite, though they were a tad skimpy on the oil. The tables have salt & pepper grinders but if you're a pepper user, don't use salt because there's a bit in the pepper (we super liked it!). She ordered the chicken breast entree that has a tropical spin (with jasmine rice) & I ordered the steak (with mashed potatoes & heirloom carrots). There was a bit of a panic when the chicken came, because it was on the bone with a wing & skin- my friend doesn't like meat on the bone, chicken wings or skin. Our waiter very apologetically offered to do what he could to make her lunch enjoyable & she settled with a side of the glaze since the glaze was only on the skin she wasn't going to eat. At that point, she liked it but I doubt she'd get it again. My steak was tasty & so were the carrots (either sauteed or lightly roasted). The mashed potatoes had a homemade texture but no butter or sauce/gravy of any sort- I ended up using some of the side of chicken glaze to spruce it up & it worked wonderfully. I'd definitely get my dish again. All in all, I think Crave has potential but a few kinks to work out. I won't rush back but I won't protest if it's suggested."}
{"text":"Very slow service at 3pm even if it was after lunch hours....it took 30 minutes to serve my food, but manager apologized.....can you imagine if it is during lunch or dinner times.....food is mediocre and not worth the money....."}
{"text":"Breanna was great. Food just ok. If you want sushi, not really that great. Expensive. Big place. Calamari was good. Veggie sushi platter good."}
{"text":"Went to Crave @ dt summerlin with a party of 4, All I can say is we will never come back here . Server was not friendly. Food was cold. We sent back fish that was cold , and they brought it back like 20 mins later !!! My whole party was already done with their food . We spoke to the manager and he was very careless !!! Overall a horrible experience !!!! Waste of money ."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is their service. Their staff is friendly and well trained. The food is below average.  We ordered their Siracha honey wings... too oily and shy in flavors.  Their food presentation is good but the flavors are subdued and bland in many cases. We ordered their chicked farfalle .. just too bland and extremely unhealthy with lots of butter floating at the bottom. My husband ordered another chicken dish in which the potatoes were cooked inconsistently and the whole dish was bland. 
We wanted to try their desserts but did not CRAVE for any after trying their appetizer and entrees. 

I have marked this restaurant off my list of places to revisit.  They need to make some serious improvement in their food flavors."}
{"text":"My very first time here and the food was great and service was great! Why did it take me so long to try this place out? Who knows....but I do know I'll be back! I ordered the wings off of the appetizer menu and didn't realize they were full wings! They we're delicious. And the price? Not bad at all! $41 for 2 orders of wings, 1 glass of wine, 1 order of French fries, chips and guacamole, and 1 strawberry lemonade! Our server was super sweet and attentive! To my military folks don't forget to ask for your military discount!"}
{"text":"I have now dined for the 3rd time at Crave and it has yet to disappoint. The first time I was in was with my two small children and we had the pleasure of having Justin as our server. While although this is a kid friendly establishment it is not a likely kid place. He took excellent care of us and convinced me to me to sign up with the rewards program. I have since been back with my boyfriend and have been served by Julie, she was very friendly and accommodating to our very wobbly table! Our last time was with Jordan and once again the standard of service was up held by him and the food, as always, was excellent. I work for one of the largest food service providers in the country and their service does not go unnoticed as well as the entire dining experience itself."}
{"text":"This place has a decent menu. Prices are a little steep. I guess if you go there at happy hour it really isn't that bad. Our server was nice and pretty attentive. I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"Loved the service, dinner and setting. Food was excellent and served quickly on a busy Friday night.  I had the poblano Caesar salad and husband had grilled halibut. Very nice upscale place for a date night. I like their beer and wine selection"}
{"text":"I had family visiting from out of town for Spring Break, and we wanted to see a movie at Regal.  Since Crave is one of very few restaurants in Downtown Summerlin that accepts reservations, it was my choice.  It was a beautiful night, and we had a great table on the patio. We were seated promptly at the reserved time, and our service and food were all without a flaw.  I like the varied menu, and the restaurant is very attractive."}
{"text":"Dined here for Mothers Day. Service was fast and amicable. 
I was bummed to hear that there happy hour and kids eat free deals didn't apply on Mothers Day, but I get why. 
My kids chowed down their buttered pasta. 
I throughly enjoyed my 702 sandwich and highly recommend it. 
The only negative was my wife's sushi. It was cooked. Kinda odd for sushi."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Crave two days ago.  Knowing Downtown Summerlin just opened recently and this restaurant is new, we were skeptical of what to expect.  However, Jordan, our waiter, was fantastic.  He suggested some great items, the Black Bean Soup and the Chicken Apple Sausage Flatbread, which were both delicious.  Back staff was always on top of refilling water and clearing plates.  We were there early, so were seated right away.  When we left, the restaurant was full and people were waiting to get in.  The bar was full and lively.

Overall, great experience and looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Yummy! We have been in twice now. The staff is friendly, the food is good, the prices are reasonable, happy hour is good too. Their wine selection by the glass is certainly lacking but that's ok! Nice place overall we will be back"}
{"text":"I have been coming here and enjoying the beautiful Fall Las Vegas weather and dining in the outdoor seating area.  My friend signed me up for the Crave card which will save you lots for your birthday, anniversary and approximately once a month spend $40 get $20 coupons they send you.  The best meal I enjoy here is the delicious Miso salmon with grilled vegetables.  It's a lovely, light dish with just enough sauce to enhance the beautiful salmon."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good, service wasn't good either. Go upstairs to Public School, their food was great!"}
{"text":"Rough grand opening but they got their stuff together now. Had a great lunch and the burger was awesome. My appetizer came out cold and the same time as my food but was till happy with the service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make of CRAVE after a couple visits.  The food is okay, but not great.  The restaurant itself seems torn between wanting to be a place anyone would like to come for a bite, and a fancy place for those special nights out.  Everything about the place seems to try and straddle that fence.

So that it's not lost in the review, the restaurant is very clean and the employees are awesome!  It's a fairly quiet place too, making it nice for holding a conversation over a meal.

The decor reflects my observation about the confusion with what this place wants to be:  a pub or wine bar, a restaurant, or a fine dining establishment.  There's nothing bad about any of it, but there's nothing that seems to really define what this restaurant's all about.  In the end it seems management is trying to appeal to everyone (leaning toward the fancy side), instead of standing out a little and making it clear why this is the place you want to come to for a certain kind of afternoon or evening.  This problem stands out even more given the number of restaurants in the immediate area that give you no doubt about what kind of place they are and why you'd want to go there.  The prices are a mix of average and high for what's served.  In the end, not bad but not great.

With an awesome location on the northern side of Downtown Summerlin, it's worth a visit if you're shopping around lunch or dinnertime, find yourself hungry and just don't have anything else specific in mind."}
{"text":"Our family went for lunch today. It was awesome!  The atmosphere, the service, the food... all terrific!!  We ordered the chicken & avocado egg rolls and the #9
Sushi roll for starters. Both excellent. For our entrees, we ordered the citrus chicken chipotle salad, the seafood paella and the blackened fish tacos. All excellent!!  We will definitely make this a regular choice when we dine out!!"}
{"text":"CRAVE has really delicious food.  Be aware, the prices are a little expensive, but most places in Downtown Summerlin are on the pricey side.  The food is good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Crave was absolutely amazing. We got seated quickly for a Friday night.  The hostess was very nice. Our waiter was great. He recommended some great appetizers and we chose the calamari with an amazing sauce. We ordered specialty drinks that were unique and very tasty. I ordered the lamb meatballs with peppered fettuccine and my buddy ordered the scallops with corn and asparagus risotto. These dishes were outstanding. The service was great.  The atmosphere was perfect. Overall,  amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful waiter but we left starving and in our opinion food is extremely overpriced! My hubby ordered poke bowl for $16 and it was so small a child wouldn't have been full. Prior to ordering he asked if was a decent size as he was pretty hungry and the waiter said it came in a pretty good size bowl, which was true but the actual food quantity was minuscule. I ordered one avocado roll and all 6 pieces could have fit in the palm of my hand.  We had a coupon or we would have cried at our $45 bill.  We did order a side of fries, small portion as well and a tempura veggie roll.  The roll was good but again, small.  It's very hard to leave a restaurant with a $45 tab and all you can think of is what can we eat when we get home! Sad to say but won't ever return and we live one mile from here."}
{"text":"I must say, I was looking forward to eating here but what awful reviews!

What is really turning me off is the pets.  I am the owner of the most precious Yorkie, I am not however a fan of dogs/pets in malls, grocery stores, and the most disgusting restaurants.

Robertos doesn't even allow dogs, at least in the eating area. Shame on you Crave! And your supposed to be upscale? And in the heart of Summerlin."}
{"text":"Always kind and fast service! Great atmosphere! 3rd time here and recommend to all! Had the loaded nachos, artichoke and spinach dip and crave wings (buffalo)! The tiramisu was tasty!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and fries, BUT microscopic sushi rolls and absurdly horrible service.

Came here on a Saturday at 2PM to grab a quick late lunch. The restaurant was mostly empty with at least half the tables empty.  Two parties in front of us and the hostess took about 10 minutes to seat us.  She did not give us a food menu.  She was wearing thigh high boots which looked hard to walk in and a spaghetti strap low-cut tank top, which is consistent with another Yelp review that also pointed out another unprofessional outfit worn by the hostess.

Our server was friendly enough, but very slow.  He never refilled my water and never came back to check on us after our food came.  A different server brought our food.  The food took 20-30 minutes to arrive.

I asked to speak to the manager and he apologized and offered us free dessert.  We declined as we were already in a rush and he gave us a coupon for $10 off or a free entree.  Took some more time for us to get the bill (i.e. the service did not improve after my complaint) and the server told us we couldn't even use the coupon! 

Skip:
- Sushi rolls here are anorexic.  Tempura shrimp roll literally has one shrimp in it and is the smallest sushi roll I have ever seen.  Priced at $10, this is a rip off.

Recommend:
- Lamb piadini sandwich. This was a 5-star sandwich with thinly sliced lamb on flatbread and comes with ."}
{"text":"Long story short my iPhone had be be in the Apple store for two hours.  We decided to give Crave a try for dinner but we were still apprehensive.  We ordered the Natchos Wow it was huge and tasty. The chicken wings were fantastic and my husbands favorite dish, the calamari was good.  The manager said the have changed the happy hour menu again so we might give them a go again for a date night."}
{"text":"We started with the jalapeño humus appetizer. It was very good but the flat bread that it came with I felt was too soft. It should be crispy. The little tomatoes on the side was very amazing. My husband had the 702 burger which he said was delicious! The fries were a little under cook but very tasty. I had the Mahi Mahi dish. It was cooked perfect. The salad & smashed potatoes that came with it was bland. The ambiance is elegant & the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I guess this bad experience could be on me for not reading reviews but I am trying to make my own experience and not based on some dude or chick's BS negative review. So here's mine. Came in a Friday night. They were busy. Ordered a bottle of wine, couple sushi items, an app and a kid meal to start. The apps and sushi came out in decent time. The kids meal came out when my wife and I were about done with the bottle of wine... this should've been a tell tale. I watched the kitchen service area and yes they were busy but no busier than any other busy restaurant in town on a Friday. My daughter was able to finish watching Cinderella start to finish before our entrees came out. I thought I order chicken and veggies only but I Guess they thought I needed rice. My wife ordered a salad which featured honeydew and almonds which were both absent... I had a bite of the chicken and I'm pretty forgiving of poultry in general but over cooked chicken breast is the worst... my wife just dealt with her lame salad. 

I ended up order long more sushi items (sushi here is avg at best). Our server wasn't bad and the mgr came by and said they comped our appetizer (the only thing that was ok). So after a worse than bad meal the bill is still $114. 

When I come to a chain restaurant I expect a decent order time. I'm guessing half of the food that comes out of the kitchen is frozen and just heat and serve. But the run time for Cinderella is 1hr 15min and hats what it took for a chicken bowl and a salad to come out... I just have to say EFF this place. My wife has points at this place too. Guess we will never get to use those for the mediocre food here. 


Update:
The owner reached out and offered a gift car for our next visit which seems nice but I don't think I'd come back here especially when there's Wolfgang's next door. Fogo and CPK a few hundred feet away, pub 702 upstairs. Heck there's even the snake river joint at the GK practice facility and a Yard House at Red Rock and a BJ's across Charleston. There's just too many better options at same or better value and quality nearby. So just a warning to every one that cares to read DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE. that's my PSA for this week."}
{"text":"Very good food. Their firecracker shrimp and chicken wings are so delicious and something that everyone should try. Great free desert. The server Richard is very attentive to our needs and has a very good customer service. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a friends birthday dinner and right off the bat the service was terrible. Our waiter was rushed and began by telling us that he's so busy and he's had a terrible day... ok that's great and all, but if you're waiting on tables NO ONE CARES how your day is, just do your job, no need to complain to costumers. He started off with sarcastic \"jokes\" that weren't at all funny and the whole group of us were just confused honestly. Besides the terrible service the food was not that great either. I had the crispy chicken slider appetizer and the chicken looked and tasted like frozen chicken tenders .. gross. They were also $14 for 3 little sliders. Overall, don't waste your time here... I drove all the way from henderson for a dinner here and was super disappointed. There are many better restaurants in downtown summerlin, I'm sure this place won't stay open for long."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and will be the last. Had dinner with the family around 5:30pm on a Wednesday.

- Our waitress was horrible. Left the table after taking everyone drink order. She seem like every time we responded to a question she would ask that we were bugging her. After we ordered our food we did not see her again until we had to ask for the check. Other staff members brought our food to us.

- Food lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Loud, Service sucked.  Waiter should have paid more attention to our food than trying to play nice guy. 
I asked for my salad to be served before main course and still have to wait after asking twice.  Of course half way through eating it down comes my dinner.  
Let's talk about that. Had the chefs special steak and while it didn't taste bad it's was one step above cold. The Brussels sprouts were cold and hard, mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box
Now let's top of the fact the server while I was still eating plops down to the others sitting at the table this \"sign up for points card\" DUDE IM STILL FREAKING EATING HERE! Next he was plopping down the check.  AGAIN IM STILL EATING MY DINNER WHY THE HELL ARE YOU RUSHING US.  
Oh wait, now that you closed out the check did you even offer desert? 
I so can't wait for the rest of the mall restaurants to open cause business will drop there with service and food served this way"}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because they won't let me put .5 star! I went for lunch and got many items to the out. Started with cucumber and spicy tuna, the rice was disgusting no flavor!!!!!! And there was carrots and micro greens in my roll, who puts that In sushi?!?! Next was chips and guacamole, what we received was stale chips and browning avocados with a small onion piece in it, no seasoning or flavor what so ever! Next was the tater tots which weren't bad just super greasy because the oil wasn't hot enough when frying. Finally we had the Béarnaise burger and beef stroganoff. The burger had no Béarnaise as it states it has, and the mushrooms where barely cooked and tasted so sweet. Burger was gross, oily and again not seasoned. Beef stroganoff was absolutely disgusting. The horseradish cream was disgusting!!!  Over all everything was edible but painful to eat. I was so disappointed. I will never eat here again and urge anyone else to save there money. Our server was okay but not extremely attentive, which I am normally fine with, unless I am the only table in the place, then I feel there is no excuse! You may think this is harsh or rude, but I am in the industry and I know standards. Such a shame, such a beautiful place, could be so great if ran correctly."}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed reviews on here. All I can say is my wife had a great experience and great meals.  The food was really fresh. Jenna was our server and she was awesome. We had sushi for a starter and it was delicious. My wife had Salmon and I chicken and pasta.  Both were really good!  We had the coconut cake for dessert. It was good but, not great."}
{"text":"Really good food (the sushi always tastes fresh) and the times we have gone, service was good to above average (doesn't hurt that we only live 5 minutes away).  And the outdoor seating area makes everything taste better :)"}
{"text":"I got to the point where I only want to write 4-5 star reviews on Yelp. I want to help businesses not hurt them!


Back to my point, my initial thoughts were: What?! Only 3 stars?! What's wrong with everyone!  

First of all the service has been on point everything I've gone in (6 times). Not only has the service been quick, the servers are very kind, considerate, and resourceful! 

Their food is magnificent! I have had their pasta, sushi, burgers, chicken wings, salmon, flat bread, steak, and mahi mahi. However, my favorite dish is the parmesan chicken pasta!

Once again, only 3 stars?! I just don't see it!"}
{"text":"Great tomato pesto soup, four cheese grilled cheese sandwich. Premium bento box of spicy tuna.  All very very good. Server Michael was good to us, even came out with a little fruit salad for our grandson who didn't take the time to taste that but did enjoy playing with the lid on his water glass"}
{"text":"I didn't have the food here but judging solely based on the drinks. We came for happy hour on a Friday and got a table outside on the patio. Even though it was hot out, it felt cool out there. I got the Ginger Lime Margarita which was really good. For my next drink, I ordered the CRAVE Manhattan. When they brought me the drink, I thought it looked more pink than usual but just shrugged it off. Once I tasted it though, I knew it was definitely not a Manhattan. I told the waitress and she went to check with the bartender. She brought me back an actual Manhattan and told me that he mixed up the order so the other one was free! As you can imagine, I was pretty lit after that haha.. I don't even care that they messed up since I got a free drink! lol.. All in all, it's a cool place and I'd love to try the food sometime."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight. We had no reservation but were easily accommodated by gracious staff. The interior has sophisticated subdued lighting and is done in rich red and brown tones. The dining area is one large open room with views of the kitchen. We were seated at one of the center tables which are a little too close together for privacy. 

My partner snd I had the turkey burger and steak sandwich. The turkey burger was fine, served with fries that were slightly greasy. The steak sandwich was quite excellent, served on a fresh hoagie with a delicious spiced mayonnaise. The steak was perfectly cooked medium with that wonderful char-broil flavor. The sandwich had green lettuce and some bits of zesty pickled celery, pepper, carrot, and pearl onions that really complimented the flavor of the meat. I rarely take a doggie bag but I brought the rest of the steak home for lunch tomorrow. 

The service is excellent. It was an overall good experience. We'll probably be back again."}
{"text":"I'm kind of at a loss for words.  I mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I can say we definitely won't be going back for any of the sushi dishes, as each dish we tried (Mexican Roll, Bamboo Bite roll, and jalapeno tuna sashimi) reminded me of the \"safe\" sushi dishes I would try when I first forayed into the sushi world.  The menu made the rolls sound creative and flavorful, but alas that wasn't the case.  It's been years, possibly decades, since I've used soy sauce on any sushi that I was sad I had to resort to it here.  Without the soy sauce, there was no flavor at all, and that's talking about rolls that purported to have special spices and sauces already added to them.  The tuna sashimi was stringy, and not buttery and I could've done without the cucumber slice.  On a positive note, the sushi didn't come off as \"fishy\" smelling or tasting, so there was that.  After finishing the sushi, again which wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either, my husband and I decided to try the hummus.  On paper, it sounded amazing, served with goat cheese and herbs infused into the hummus, and rainbow cauliflower and toasted baguettes for dipping.  Again, the flavor was \"okay\" but there was too much of a layer of diced veggies dubbed as \"bruschetta\" on top of the hummus that we had to push to the side and the hummus itself had too much of an herb flavoring to it.  We had two bites and finally just opted for a slice of chocolate cake to share.  We will definitely go back and give it another try, as the menu boasted pastas, burgers, steaks, and salads that looked good as we saw them go by our table.  The bar area looked like a great place to meet for apps and drinks, and catch a game or two and the outside seating in the arroyo area of DTS also looked inviting.  Props to our server, who was friendly and efficient.  I'm hoping our experience was just a fluke, and we are open to another visit."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give it 3.5 but I don't feel it was good enough to round to 4. My best friend and boyfriend of best friend wanted to try something different. We decided to go to Crave for two reasons. 1. It was in Downtown Summerlin and we wanted to go shopping. 2. They had sushi. We made a reservation and headed over. We sat down in a little table and got some menus and the waiter explained the place to us. They have two kitchens, one regular and also a sushi kitchen. We took a moment to look over the menu and kinda just ordered a little bit of everything. We ordered a couple rolls, truffle fries, guac and chips, edamame, flat bread pizza, and even some mac and cheese. My favorite was probably the crunchy spicy tuna roll. We ordered so much they had to extend out table. HAHA, fatasses. We also ordered drinks. I had the blueberry Lemonade, very delicious if you like mint. It has mint leaves in it so it wasn't very lemony. We also ordered lemon drop shots which were strong. My friends also ordered some beers and ciders. We discussed the meal together and came up with 3.5. The flat bread was a little cold and not super tasty. The fries were probably my second favorite. I mean they are fries, you can't do much to mess them up. The guac was on a pile of lettuce which made it look like there was more than there was, also don't like lettuce in my guac, hopefully i'll remember to order it without the next time. Our server was really nice tho. He gave us as much information as he could and helped us organize our table to fit everything. I want to go back and try more items and hopefully fine something more memorable."}
{"text":"I went the for the second time yesterday, the only reason I returned was because I received 3 free appetizer coupons after finding a hair in my salad my first visit. The place had maybe three people in it. Though I'm visibly pregnant and the place was empty they sat my friend and I at the bar.
The waitress mentioned happy hour was coming up and even though we explained we wouldn't be drinking she failed to mention the food specials (which we found later on after we ordered) We ordered two salads, truffle fries, and the crab and artichoke dip with my coupon. The waitress never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything else and I had to chase her down every time she dashed by without refilling our waters. I wasn't a fan of the aioli for the fries and wanted ranch.. I was able to ask her for some about 10 minutes after we were served. Ten MORE minutes later she comes back and says oh no one brought you ranch? By now the fries are cold and soggy. She offers to take the fries off the menu. We ask for more flat bread crackers for our dip which we were charged extra for... My friend takes a bite with dip and finds A STRING OF PLASTIC in her mouth!!! We stopped a manager and to tell him what happened. He apologizes, leaves, comes back and says \"You know what I think it was? A bristle from the brushes they use to clean the kitchen.. You know like a toothbrush.\" UM WTF!! Yuck!!!!! How did that get in the food?!! He returned with some more free appetizer cards and a $10 off coupon for the next visit buuuut I'm honestly scared to come back. Also hate not being checked on in an empty restaurant. I personally have never worked in the food industry but if I was a manager I think it would be common sense to train your servers to come check on the table 2-3 minutes after being served."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since they opened!
Went in with my Sister after catching a movie at the new mall.

Our food was really good! Started with the calamari, it was good, but nothing special.
For dinner, I had the lamb meatballs and fettuccine and it was very tasty. 
Over all the food was fine, but not incredible. In the same price point (our dinner was about $100) you could have something really special. 

What was the highlight of the night was our waitress. She was awesome! Fun, friendly and right on the ball! Which is funny, since most of the lesser reviews here talk about the flawed service here. But that was not our experience at all!

My over all take on this place is it is good, but not great. The price point is a bit high, but I suspect that the rent for this new location is insane. I get it.

Would I go back, sure. Would I suggest it. Maybe."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak sliders and the Dirty Flirty cocktail. Must say, the \" Dirty Flirty\" was pretty intense, the dirty martini had few bits of prosciutto & bleu cheese stuffed olives. The steak sliders were delicious, could of used more of the \"juniper mayo'. Definitely would go back to try the sushi.

2nd time going to this restaurant the experience was not what I expected since they've been open for longer than 2 weeks. Waited 30 mins for a table for 2. I noticed a group complain that their buzzer wasn't working and apparently the battery died. The restrooms were again not cleaned and refilled with paper towels. Not sure if this place is going to change anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service! Server was friendly, bubbly & attentive; also was knowledge of gluten free menu or any related questions I had about menu items. She offered suggestions of what food to order based on variety of preferences. We split the hummus for an appetizer and absolutely loved it; very unique. Then we got the mahi mahi with a shrimp infused rice & steak kale beet salad for our entrees and were both happy with choices. Only thing I would have liked was more emphasis on the beets in the salad, but I still enjoyed what I got. I Will definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on opening weekend and it was inevitably chaotic. Although the wait was rather long and there were alot of open tables (I understand it is they want to pace the flow) we were seated and greeted promptly. Our adorable server Cameron was amazing. He was efficient and thorough in answering all our questions about the menu and accommodating our allergies. Per his recommendations we started out with the Jumbo Shrimp (Mind blowing) and We ordered the Roasted Half chicken and Norwegian Salmon for our entrees. Both were incredible - The chicken was perfectly seasoned - almost had an indian kind of curry taste and the salmon was to die for with it's crispy mustard crust. Cameron seems to be a reader of minds as anything we needed, he got it without us even asking and still made time to chat it up with us amidst the chaos in the restaurant (we probably heard dishes dropped by employees 3 times while we were there). Cameron suggested a coconut cake for dessert which just pushed our meal over the top. We had several managers stop by our table to make sure everything was okay which was a fantastic touch. Amazing, We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sushi, cheeseburgers, and pasta all served with the class of a fine dining restaurant. This is like a wealthy stoners paradise. 

I came here with a table of ten on their official opening day during the Downtown Summerlin insanity. Turns out this was the only restaurant that was open for business and you could tell. Crave was bursting at the seams; the bar was overflowing with the Real Housewives of Summerlin, the patio had the aging bros and most likely the ex-husbands of the fore mention housewives, and the dining room was a hodgepodge of suits, children, and hungry looking patrons. The front desk was backed up and a little unorganized, we had reservations for 8:30pm, but weren't sat until about 9:15pm.

The food options at Crave can be confusing, but in a good way. As I read the menu I wanted a little bit of everything and when the waiter took our table's order I noticed everybody must have felt the same way. We ordered sushi, fried chicken, sliders, calamari, and a Margherita flatbread. I only ended up trying the sliders and calamari... 

The slider was very good, a seared piece of pork belly with kimchi, placed on a very soft dinner roll. Full of flavor and the pork belly wasn't too fatty. The calamari was forgettable and it was served with a jalapeño aioli which I though was good, but it didn't quite fit with the flavor of the calamari. This would be better on a sandwich or burger, not with a seafood dish. 

After we finished our appetizers we had about 35 minutes of waiting before our food was finally served. I ordered the Bison Burger with fries and when it finally arrived it was cold and you could tell that the fires had been siting for awhile, they looked wilted and old. I was starving so at this point I really didn't care about the food's temperature, I just wanted to eat. The Bison Burger was very tasty even at a lukewarm temp. This chunk of beef came with a healthy slab of pork belly on top of it and a tasty aioli. I can only imagine was this must taste like straight out of the kitchen. 

There's a lot of things to consider in this review:
- It's their grand opening day. There's going to be hiccups and as a customer and former restaurant worker, I understand this
- They were the only restaurant open at the time. I don't know of any place that can feed about 2,000 people within a few hours and not mess up once or twice
- Our server was solid. We always had fresh water and drinks in front of us
- The manager came over and checked on our table multiple times
- The place was crackin', I mean slammed! So, the fact that we only waited 35 minutes for our meal really isn't that bad. If you have good company, and we did, time will fly. 

This review is really a 2.5 stars, but the service pushed to a 3 star. I will be back in a few months to see if they have worked out the kinks.  

JUST A NOTE - If you give brutal reviews to restaurants on their opening day. You're probably an insanely critical jerk with everything in life. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Don't go hungry. This place is slowwwwwwwww. Party of 5 last night. Watched my daughters COLD sushi sit near a heat lamp for 37 minutes before attempting to be served. Then when they did we refused it. Brought us another. Manager came over. Lady and I don't think she was a manager and just apologized. I felt very sorry for our server. She was working hard but the kitchen staff needs work yet. They opened way too soon. Won't try again until next year!! Save your $$$ on this place until they work the kinks out!"}
{"text":"Sunday, May 8, 2016. The online advertised Mothers Day Brunch buffet was NOT what we received upon arrival today. This was a special day resulting in let down and disappointment to say the very least. Shame on Craves management team for enticing return/repeat customers such as ourselves via online advertising to \"book reservation for Mother's Day brunch\" using LAST YEARS 2015 Mother's Day brunch PHOTOS of their previous brunch buffet layout. The only reason we returned for this years Mother's Day is because of said brunch buffet. Ultimately, their management team should refrain from using BAIT and SWITCH shameless tactics. Word of mouth is what brings business in, not lies. There are many wonderful Restaraunt options in Las Vegas to choose from. Why would anyone choose this establishment for special occasions, when they participate in unsavory deceptive advertising?"}
{"text":"Considering going to Downtown Summerlin is like taking a road trip for me, finding a new exciting place to eat was part of the thrill in my journey. 
The menu at Crave was unique and enticing, so, Allison S., myself, and my other half Brent S. decided to give it a try. 
Off top, the service was great. Maybe a bit overstaffed due to the recent opening, but every face was smiling and welcoming from the host, to the chef, to the wait staff. 
Between us, we ordered edamame, a couple sushi rolls, and jumbo shirmp. I also endulged in a martini, because they offer blue cheese stuffed olives and I just can't ever seem to turn those down. We weren't looking for full meals, just something to hold us over.  
So basically, in my own humble opinion, this place has mediocre food, an overpriced menu, and a faux gourmet intention when you are getting nothing of the sort. 
Why should an 8pc. sushi roll with spicy tuna and shrimp be $19?! Because I am in the new mall in Summerlin, eh, NO. 
Why should 4 appetizers and a cocktail cost $80!? Not my style. Was the food decent, sure. I would eat all of it again. But I would never pay that much for it. I could easily go to Ra, or Sushi Roku, for gourmet sushi, AND IT STILL WON'T BE $19 A ROLL!! 
The decor was beautiful, the cocktail was great. (other than the fact that only ONE of my olives was stuffed, LAME!) But remember, Wetzels Pretzels is still 500 feet away, and Crave, you are not good enough to charge the prices you're asking. Rent must be super high at this location. Sitting between MTO (which has GREAT prices) and a Wolfgang establishment, where its worth the price, my final words for Crave, GOOD LUCK."}
{"text":"Awesome food...just enough and the setting is grest!  Our server Adam was very attentive and genuine..he was amazing!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the sushi boats, and the sushi tasted like supermarket sushi. The boat itself was $26. They were probably one of the worst tasting sushi I've had in my entire life..... Fish was far from fresh, and the rice was definitely not sushi rice. My boyfriend liked their ribeye steak though so that was fine. Service was great. Just avoid their sushi at all cost...."}
{"text":"This place looked like a  pretty good place to have lunch... Well after ordering we got our dish and it was NOTHING like it said on the the menu... 
First of all the fries were SOGGY and GREASY and the burger was just ok. 
My pasta dish was OILY and GREASY... 
Our iced teas sat there empty for awhile and NO one came to refill it...
TOTALLY BAD SERVICE AND FOOD WAS AWFUL... NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the service was horrible. The waiter kept on spitting and was rude. They messed the food multiple times. If you can handle incompetent chefs and less than smart waiters I'd say go, but otherwise it's a bust."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a friend of mine and before my first time going I called to see if they have any vegan selections and they replied saying \"many options, they're just spread throughout the menu\" I ordered the veggie roll, which has no Suchi in it, just rice sea weed, avocado and veggies. It was pretty good. Only downside was my waiter didn't really take me saying I'm \"vegan\" seriously. I asked him what I should order and he kept pointing out items with dairy, and even offered me dessert with ice cream! I just thought waiters and waitresses would have better knowledge of what vegan and vegetarian is. Over all. Everyone is very nice. My friend loves Crave and even got a rewards card. I hope more vegan options come on the menu. It's a very nice restaurant but the appetizers are just as much as the entrees . Weird. Probably will be back :)"}
{"text":"I can't really figure out why this place is only getting a three star rating... When I loved my dish...I will say a lot of their entree dishes are severely over priced... Which is what I am going to deduct stars for...And my mom was not impressed with her chicken farfalle. It was a 20.95 dinner priced item (it was also a lunch sized portion that they only charge you 13.95 during the day for). Don't order it unless you're there for lunch... Not worth the money and you won't be getting extra food... Or even a dinner salad with the dish.

My dinner was great... Price point was on point. They accommodated me totally, Being vegan and Taking out the sashimi and adding a few extra cucumber and avocado rolls. The veggie roll it came with was delicious and flavorful. The rice was just a tad but dry... And I would always prefer brown over white... I'll ask next time if that's an option. It was 13.95 for a lot of food... Saving them some stars..

The edamame app was severely over priced.  8 dollars for a child sized portion... I'm not sure why I even ordered it or what I was thinking... But it wasn't worth 8 bucks... I could of got 4 large bags of traders joes edamame... For what I spent on one serving there. Never again. Please note they use fish sauce... So order it steamed... With just Lemon and sea salt if you are vegan. 

The server was really accommodating and sweet. She was on top of the table and we never had to ask for anything. She was knowledgable about the menu and accommodating to my life style. I probably will come back for happy hour... Or lunch... But 50 bucks for dinner... For the two of us... For two mediocre dishes is not really my thing... My dish was amazing and so was the service. That's whats earning them three stars. Get your prices together guys! If I'm spending 20 dollars on an entree... I don't want the bottoms of my table to be balanced with napkins on the ends of the legs to keep it from wobbling... Or having a free stoli bright read umbrella over my head... Yes those are free from
The liquor reps... Fix the patio decor and ambiance... Throw a candle on the table... Make me feel like I'm in a 20 dollar entree price point.... You guys can do better than 3 stars!! I'm coming back to give it another chance... And I'll update accordingly... Hopefully your happy hour saves you next time."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed it. I do have to say the regular menu is pretty pricey but the food was well worth it! We went during happy hour and everything sounded so appetizing.

Our waiter DeAndre was so nice and welcoming. He even gave us a little Japanese history when he gave us hot towels to wipe our hands. I like the atmosphere and I love the location! Overall it's worth it during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The grand opening for Downtown Summerlin was crazy and this being a few places for sit down dinning, it was quite the wait. I am impressed with the service from the hostess to the wait staff. Miranda, our host, was wonderful and pleasant, she disclosed the wait time and accommodated us ASAP when our wait time had surpassed. Emily, our waitress was exceptional, she made sure we were taken care of even having worked since 10am, still upbeat and pleasant. 

We ordered the Michelada and it was amazing! The Poké Tacos are delicious. We tried the Black bean soup and Caesar Poblano Salad was delicious. The grass feed beef burger was just tender and scrumptious.

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was attracted to crave because of their menu options, but was quickly disappointed from the first course and all the way through to dessert. There are many choices for dinner but maybe they should narrow it down instead and really focus on quality and taste. I order a CRAVE house salad, which was not bad, but was lacking the walnuts and goat cheese ( the only two ingredients other than the lettuce and dressing). Next I had the lettuce wraps and fish tacos as an entree, both selections from the appetizer menu. The lettuce wraps were served on butter lettuce instead of iceberg, which sounds good at first, but is all wrong due to a lack of crunch or any real texture you are looking for in lettuce wraps. The pulled chicken was also very stringy and soaked, and i mean soaked, in hoisen sauce. Way way too sweet. The fish tacos were the best part of the meal, they had potential to be really good but was lacking fish and had a lot of corn salsa instead. My husband ordered the 702 burger, which sounded great on paper. When it was delivered it looked good too, nice presentation, but the taste was not as good as the look. It was way too greasy, he had to fork and knife it to eat it because it was too greasy to hold itself together. He ordered it medium and it was medium well to well, almost no pink at all. The bacon was really sweet and thick, also making it a dessert burger. The truffle fries were pretty good though he had on the side. For dessert we ordered coconut cake to go. What a let down. Barely any cake in this slice. I am not saying it wasnt large. I am saying it was all frosting, and not good frosting, tasted like right out of the can frosting. Again way too sweet. We had a couple bites eating around the frosting and just threw it away. This place is called crave because if you are craving salt and sugar its perfect. They could use some dusting and detailed cleaning though. Service was not bad either, waitress was kind, but never checked up on us."}
{"text":"Our server, Chyna, was so friendly and personable. She could give lessons on being customer friendly. She was great. Everything we ordered to eat was very good, from burgers to sushi. Only negative would be the balsamic vinegar dressing on the salad was just too too tart to eat. A place we will return to and hopefully Chyna will be our server again."}
{"text":"We decided to come to Crave because my son was having a birthday soon and he wanted Mac N Cheese. Lol. Perfect- mom and dad get real food, kids get spoiled. AND KIDS EAT FREE EVERY DAY WITH THE PURCHASE OF AN ADULT ENTREE. 

Before heading in I stopped at lulu for an exchanged and they had a coupon at the register for a FREE APPETIZER. Score. 

- fish tacos. Free, okay, prob wouldn't order again. 
- chips and guac. Chips were stale and there wasn't more than half a cup of guac, which had def been sitting out a min. 
- Bourbon BBQ chicken sandwich. We ordered this with the idea of ordering more food, dad announced that we were sharing. The sandwich came spit for the two of us! That was an extremely considerate move on the server. Way to go. 
Now the sandwich itself- thick and juicy. Bacon on point 

All and all the place is nothing amazing, but better than average. Good for families and large groups but NOT for date night. 

Birthday boys and girls receive a cupcake compliments of the chef. So sweet.

Sign up for the rewards program for extra perks.
I'll be back to try out the sushi."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was disappointing. We went for lunch and from the point of being seated to having our check brought to us was slow. We finished our drinks before our appetizer came out, requested refills, ate our appetizers with empty glasses, finished our appetizers and still had empty glasses. I requested ketchup...it took 8.32 min. Take your timer and have your staff sit in front of a hot plate (mine was not so hot btw) and have them wait 8.32 min. You get my point. Now, had the restaurant been busy this would have been somewhat acceptable. It was not busy, there were several empty tables. I witnessed employees sipping out of a glass, joking with other staff (including my server) and basically taking their time. The food was served cold, it was underwhelming, over salted and on top of that, hard to enjoy due to the not so great service. Frankly, there are plenty of places to spend my money on food. This will not be one of them.
 
I'd like to end this with something positive...our server smiled a lot!"}
{"text":"After a full day of shopping at the new Summerlin shopping mall we had a good appetite. There were several new restaurants in the area but Crave caught our attention.  The outside was very attractive and the menu had a good selection to choose from. We walked in and the restaurant was decorated in ultra modern décor. The hostess greeted us and asked if we had reservations.  Never understood why this  question is asked because there were empty tables available. My wife asked the hostess to sit us in a nice area.  She guided us through the restaurant to our table which was a booth in the middle of the restaurant. We had a view of the bar and the outside. The waitress came to our table and greeted us. She immediately asked us for our drink order and asked if we wanted to start off with appetizers. The waitress suggested that my daughter order the raspberry lemonade. My wife and I ordered a bottle of wine.  I knew that I was going to order a big meal so we skipped the appetizers even though they had a good variety.  

The waitress returned with our drinks.  The raspberry lemonade looked delicious and was. Then she presented the wine by displaying the bottle and opening it for us to taste and proceeded by filling our glasses. She left allowing us to review the menu. The menu had a good variety, beef, chicken, pork, seafood, pasta, sushi, sashimi and a section of chef signature dishes.

The waitress return to take our orders, my daughter order the marinara and pasta with french fries from the kids menu.  My wife ordered the sea bass and I ordered the rib eye steak.

Within 15-20 minutes our entrees came to the table which had a nice presentation and looked delicious. We preceded to eat, however I did not have a steak knife and my wife was missing her knife. We stopped our waitress and requested the knifes. The waiter should have notice or asked us if there was anything else we needed. Our waitress brought the knifes to the table and apologized.  

We began eating our entrees.  My wife thought that her sea bass was cooked to  perfection, light and moist with the right amount of seasoning.  The pasta with marinara was a little gummy but the french fries were crisp on the outside and soft in the center. My steak was very good, medium rare with good flavor, charred brussel sprouts and creamy mashed potatoes. 

The waitress checked on us several times and refilled our wine glasses which shows that she was trained properly.  At the end of our meal the waitress returned and asked us if we wanted dessert. Unfortunately, we were stuff.

Overall the experience was average because the restaurant was relatively new and need some refinement.  It would have been nice if they offered complimentary bread at the table and a little more attention to detail. We will be back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the terrible reviews really stem from, but I'm sitting here now after a wonderful meal and will definitely be back. We were seated almost immediately, the menu has some very excellent looking meals, the service was spot on, and everything we had: artichoke crab dip, volcano roll, Crave starter salad, the crab topped filet (cooked med rare perfectly), and the Angry Dragon martini were all fabulous. I would say it could possibly be because we were here at a slightly later hour, but it was quite busy since it was the same night Red Rock had their fireworks show for their 10th anniversary. Like I said before, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything was Amazing! Service, food, value... Autumn was our server, she was excellent. We joined their loyalty club and look forward to coming back soon... FYI, kids eat free all the time (with adult meal purchase.)"}
{"text":"The food was okay happy hour was cheap but the portions were so small. Food isn't anything to die for and there sushi is gross. Our server some nice young guy was super nice . But the food was still gooood ... the owner is extremely nice and reached to me to fix the problem I haven't been back since but I'll be back soon to try it again . I'm sure this time around everything will be super dope."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times so far already and will continue to be a customer, I just crave this place sometimes. They're salmon with miso is my favorite, drinks r delicious, and the chocolate layer cake is just to die for. Glad I decided to try this place!"}
{"text":"Yikes! So let me start out by saying that I was extremely excited to try this place out and ended up a tad bit disappointed.. Or maybe that's an understatement.. I was beyond disappointed. I made a reservation through opentable.com for a party of two. Upon arriving I was greeted by a very polite hostess who asked where I would like to dine (inside or outside). I of course wanted to dine outside because the weather was perfect. So here's where the train started to wreck. We waited for our server for approximately 15 minutes. 1 person came up to tell us that she would be right with us and then she didn't come over as soon as we expected. Now don't get me wrong she was a very nice and polite server but that doesn't cut it when it comes to moving quickly and efficiently. The excuse that they may or may have not been busy can be forgotten. In this case they weren't! So for my appetizer I ordered the CRAVE stack sushi roll and my partner ordered the Crunchy Roll. The sushi was just OK..Dragon Fruit martini was good! For dinner I went with the 702 Burger that was recommended by our server which I wasn't impressed at all. Took OVER 20 minutes for two burgers to come out? Really?? And then to comer out not even the right way? When it came out the bacon was BURNT..like burnt to capacity! I showed my server and even she agreed that was unacceptable and that she'd have some more bacon sent out to me. Fries were cold on both of our plates had to have more fries sent out. The problem is that it took about 15 mins for that and I literally was damn near done with the burger by then. My partner had the CRAVE burger and he to was not impressed with the burger so I'm really not sure if we just caught them on a bad night (if they are allowed to have those) but yeah the jury is still out on whether or not I will be returning or not. Management hopefully reads these reviews because clearly the general consensus is that they need to get it together.. I can now see why they are rated an average 3 star! I really wanted to like this place especially because it's so close to my house.."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! 

Yes, yes! I just love this place! I'm gonna try not being bias here as the whole reason of writing a review is to give the readers and idea of the type of experience we had by eating there. So, let's start by talking about their location, service, foods, deals and finally what makes them different from other restaurants.

Located at Downtown Summerlin in Las Vegas, The CRAVE restaurant has a very good location right by the Red Rock and the luxury theater Downtown Summerlin. I have been eating there since they first started and I have to say that I'm still getting impressed with every new dish I try.

What I love about it is their service and deals! I got a royalty card that it's very useful, it's not just a cheap punch card, it's a card made of hard plastic just like a credit card. You can always expect your card to reward you with something every time you eat there. Sometimes it's going to be a simple $10.00 discount, but sometimes it will give you a two for one entree or even a free meal. Keep in mind that their entrees are just out of this world. Their servers are well trained and very happy for working there, which makes the whole experience very enjoyable.

Ask the servers to help you choose something, trust me, they know what's up. But if you are looking for a something specific, you can still dig thru the menu to find it. Their menu is very diverse, from amazing steaks and salads, to poke bows, chicken wings and even flatbreads; everything you order is going to be top quality and presentation.

My only concern is the price, since their food is so delicious that you might end up spending more than you wanted (happens to me all the time at restaurants like this one where everything is damn good). Besides that, make sure you ask for the royalty card and sign up for their email marketing so that you can get to know about their special deals and events.

Finally, I can't finish my reviews without letting you know what's good there right out of my review. You must order their truffle fries, then try their flatbread and their chicken wings. For your main entree, order a File Minion with Crab sauce and vegetables. They have a great list of wines and beers too. They also have sushi, OMG, how can it get better than that? Well, it does when they have deals that allow you to get two entrees for the price of one! Me and my wife got two File Minions with crab sauce for the price of one!!!' Yes, two top meals for one!!! Of course it doesn't happen that often, so that's why you must subscribe to their email marketing list and get the awesome Royalty card!!!!!! Just an awesome place!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. The hostess was not friendly at all. She told us we could wait outside for her to seat us. We awkwardly stood among the outdoor tables and waited for her to come out and eventually chose a table ourselves. The table had a teapot on it from a previous diner which nobody bothered to remove, the hostess \"cleaned\" the table with a paper napkin. The waiter was nice but didn't know a lot about the menu items. When our food was delivered we didn't have any flatware or napkins. We asked the expo for flatware and she returned with fork and knife. When we then said we needed napkins, which was obvious, she was clearly irritated. My boss, who I had brought to lunch, received the wrong item which she ate anyway. The waiter was kind enough to have the correct item prepared so she could take it to go. Coffee, tea or dessert was not offered at the end of the meal. The food was quite good but the poor service overshadowed it. Some of the employees at Crave need to look for a different field because hospitality is clearly not their strength. I will not return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"After my 81 year old mother prepared our Thanksgiving meal I decided to take her out last Saturday to relax and enjoy a good dinner. The $5 cup of black bean soup was fine, however after that, things got bad.  We ordered the \"steak\" sliders as an appetizer.  They were a sad shade of gray, tasteless, tough and luke warm.  Couldn't figure out if it was salisbury steak, or something more sinister.  $15 for 3 of these monstrosities was criminal. The calamari was tasty, but skimpy, and again luke warm.  The caeser salad was bland, with absolutely no flavor, and next to no dressing.  
       Ordering the 'signature' rib eye for the main course was another huge disappointment.  $31 for a steak 3/8ths of an inch thick is absurd.  I don't think they are getting nervous at Del Frisco's.  After all this mediocrity, we decided to skip desert at Crave, and purchase some items from the nearby Trader Joe's.
      The highlight of the meal was the desert from Trader Joe's.  I am not a malicious person, however I need to warn other yelp fans about this $155 fiasco.  For that type of money we could have had an outstanding meal at the nearby Vintner's Grill or Honey Salt."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! We get there and order our food...we ask for a bread basket and it cost extra. My son had hair in his food..When I told the waiter he said do you want me to take his food back to the kitchen???? I'm like did you really need to ask that question??? Then they bring my salmon and it is under cooked in fact just about raw. I told the waiter and while he's somewhat apologizing he spits on the table and keeps talking. We are like WHAT??.? So they bring my son out his food and a whole 20 minutes later they brought my food and I'm like keep it...we're leaving.  Prices and high. .
Service bad. ..
I WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour last week and we were not impressed. First off, terrible service... We sat for over 15 minutes at our booth before served. Second, the menu is not as impressive as we were hoping. Food was good but the drinks were only okay. Probably will not try again."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING YOU MAY CRAVE

This is a very INTERESTING restaurant.... There is a VARIETY of things going on... They have things from American... Mediterranean... to SUSHI... RANDOM but also... if you can't decide what you want... i guess you can come here for a VARIETY of Choices.

I have been here before when they were fairly new... the food was AMAZING! this time around... i was a bit disappointed... as the selection i made again of what i had eaten before was NOT the SAME as what i was expecting.

Our server was nice, but she seemed like she was having a bit of a rough day... We also ordered a bottle of wine & there was some spilling action due to the capsule not being cut off all the way... which the wine hit & just dripped all over the table =/ 

Came here w/ 2 of the girlfriends so we shared a bunch of different things.

BREAD BASKET $3 - different kinds of bread & probably wouldn't get it again while paying... prefer to get truffle fries as a filler but our server forgot to put our order in for this & we were already too full to tell her.

CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP $13.95 - a mix of crab & artichoke tossed in a lemony mayo served hot w/ flat-bread. This thing was freaken AMAZING & scorching hot which made it even tastier. The crispy flat-bread just perfects the dish!

CRAVE HUMMUS $9.95 - a pesto & goat cheese infused hummus served w/ rainbow cauliflower & fresh veggie bruschetta w/ crostini. This was not my style & we probably made the least dent in this item. It just had a sour taste to each bite... =/

ARGENTINE STYLE RIB-EYE $31.95 - rubbed w/ palm sugar rub & chimichurri served w/ potato puree & rainbow cauliflower. I was hoping to taste some chimichurri but the palm sugar rub was overpowering & it tasted like a sweet piece of meat rather than the melody of sweet & savory....

SAUTEED SCOTTISH SALMON $21.95 - mustard crusted served w/ grain beurre blanc, potato puree, heirloom carrots. PERFECTION on this dish, although i don't like salmon... i had to try it. it was also a HUGE piece of fish! the mustard crust gave it a nice blend in flavor.

SIMPLY GRILLED HALIBUT $MP - typically served w/ coconut jasmine rice & roasted rainbow cauliflower, but i got potato puree & asparagus instead. This was a very DISAPPOINTING dish... the fish was like GOO... i LOVE LOVE halibut & i just couldn't eat it.... every bite, it was like MUSH rather than FLAKEY meaty goodness... also tasted fishy which typically should NOT be the case for HALIBUT!"}
{"text":"I had the Poke', Yellow tail , and seaweed salad , all were excellent ! Display, quality of product , and service were perfect. The citrus pot of herbal tea , with lemon and honey, I believe it to be the best served in town, right up there with the four seasons.   My only suggestion is to get a selection of Wheat less Vegan deserts , then you will have me there all the time.  I had No Bad Reaction to any of their food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and service/food always good. I think priced on the high side but has a not so normal menu. It offers twists on classics like the Mac n cheese(can you say yummy) to sushi. I go back because I do like the menu and service always good."}
{"text":"I crave the food at Crave. Their salads and sandwiches and soups are delightful and worth the trek across town. 

It's interesting how we can all have such different dining experiences at the same place. My experience has consistently been a positive one at Crave. The staff is always friendly and on point. They know their ingredients, and have made excellent recommendations upon our asking. 

In comparison to the neighboring restaurant Lazy Dog to which I am not a fan, Crave feels upscale. Everything has been taken into careful consideration from the heavy silverware to the stylish glassware. It's beautiful inside. 

The menu: I LOVE the apple, brie, chicken sandwich on tandoori bread. It topped with peppery arugula and drizzled with balsamic. Just dreamy if you ask me. The cobb salad is a close second. Desserts are always hard to resist at Crave. The standout tome is the apple bread pudding. Lots of porn noises made while devouring this and don't ask me what conversations were had when this was in front of me. I was more interested in the flavors on my spoon. 

Pricing is average for a dinner in Summerlin. Also, prices are posted on the menu. Don't dine here or anywhere for that matter if you don't like the pricing. 

Crave now has a new promotion called Slay, Rose (Rosay). Specials on Rose wine and they will also give you a pitcher of rose to play rose bong with it. Lol. How creative and fun. 

While everyone else in the mall are at the Dog place I can't stand I will be here feeling Queenie and shit."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for lunch today. This is a lively, high-energy spot with a diverse menu. My waitress was very nice and attentive. I tried the Bison burger and fries; both were tasty!  I really liked the fact that they offer mini desserts (nice when you just want a little something sweet).  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I this for happy hour on Saturday. We really like the menu and we try the pork potstickers, aloha roll, spicy tuna roll, Parmesan truffle fries, Tempura bite, lettuce wraps and the Kinky Moijito and Madras Martini.  The Kinky Mojitos was really good  and we ended up having several of them :-). When Joy everything that we ordered and the service was phenomenal. Our server was Michael who knew the menu and made some good suggestions and was really great as far as checking on us and bein very attentive.  Michael was fantastic and he even went above and beyond by tracking me down in Summerlin shops when I mistakenly left my eyeglass case in the restaurant. He could've easily left it, but he heard where we were going next, found us and brought it to me.....how great is that!!! We will definitely be going back for one of the girls weekend happy hours."}
{"text":"had a birthday celebration at Crave last night. we were a bigger group of about 12 people, we were promptly greeted and asked if we were celebrating anything special, we replied yes a birthday! server brought waters but never asked if we wanted to order drinks, we of course asked him for drinks. then asked if we were ready to order instead of offering appetizers first, so we all ordered apps n entree at same time. service could have been better! most everyone ordered dessert but they never did anything for the birthday girl, that was pretty rude!"}
{"text":"The food here is probably one of the best in downtown summerlin. I have come here for date nate with my girlfriend multiple times and I have always been impressed."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go eat! Everything we've had has been a home run, especially the apple sausage flatbread pizza! Chef Shaun is amazingly talented and we are happy to follow him to whatever restaurant he works at."}
{"text":"Don't get your poke bowl here! The Mexican poke bowl was $18.95. I guarantee you can, get 2 medium bowls at a specialized poke place, with healthy portions of protein, toppings, and avocado. Not. Here.

The chicken apple brie sandwich looks mouth watering; presentation stands out in the food preparation here at Crave. But dry chicken without flavor within it, always tastes better with added sauce and thin sliced apples.

We had a good sized party of 7 adults. Even so, the restaurant did not seem that busy, but our food took a while. It was nice of our server to acknowledge our low on level drinks, he was really pleasant. I hope the tip I left all goes just to him.

The ambience gets a star and a half, our server gets a star. If our food weren't overpriced or actually had a flavor score, I may be more generous with my decision of the rating. At this point, the reason I found to possibly dine here again is for dessert and happy hour. Then again I'm positive there are other places that top the happy hour temptations. You'd have to have a strong sense of influence to have me try another menu item, and make me change my mind on 2.5**"}
{"text":"My aunt and I stopped in Crave for some post Christmas shopping lunch. It was a beautiful place to dine and the food was good. My aunt enjoyed a sweet potato soup, while I opted for a sushi roll and chicken wings. Everything came out pretty quick and the staff was nice. There was nothing cosmic about my meal, but it was good. If in the area I wouldn't be opposed to eating there again, but I would probably try another place before opting for a repeat Crave experience."}
{"text":"We tried this establishment when it first opened. We walked into the place it smelled like rotten fish. We ordered our food needless to say it was just terrible. 5 of us no one had a nice thing to say. I will say the manager with kind and, most of the mail which we did not ask for. She encouraged us to try this again. We tried a few weeks ago oh, I'm sorry to say we have to pass."}
{"text":"Fantastic Experience! The staff was attentive, kind, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Our waiter Andrew was top notch and the manager Kevin was welcoming and passionate about this Resturant! We were greeted with a friendly team and well taken care of. The sushi was AWESOME! Fresh and top shelf! WELL DONE to the entire staff!

Another Fantastic Meal and Experience!
Sat at the sushi bar and the chefs took amazing care of us.....presented us with some new indicative and delirious dishes! Beautifully prepared and served! OITSTANDING"}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a sit down location and your in the area, this is an OK spot. I wouldn't drive here to eat here...food is OK, others are better in the area, however, the ambiance is probably better than most in the downtown summerlin.

I would eat here again only if I wanted a sit down spot and was shopping across the street"}
{"text":"I work in the area and after work my friend said lets eat at crave. we did restaurant week.
we each had the pork dumplings. i also had the burger and he had the sushi box. 
2 hours later the food poisoning kicked in. I've been a restaurant manager before. so im understanding that things happen. I called to let them know what had happened that both my friend and I got very badly sick and we both had the dumplings. I was simply calling to alert them. i didn't want anything free. the host (like she has any training in this area) said \"oh, food poisoning takes 24 hours to kick in.\" Even though that isn't true i didn't appreciate her fighting me when i was simply trying to help. 

She took down my name and number and said a manger would contact me to check in on me and how i was feeling. 

.......Well its a week later and no one called. 

I used to come here A LOT after work. NOT ANYMORE!"}
{"text":"Came here with the mr. for an early week happy hour.  Our server was nice but our food was ready before our drinks.  We had the pork belly sliders, tuna roll, and philly roll.  The food was meh, who puts lettuce in a philly roll?  Good luck keeping customers when all of the resturaunts are open."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I have to say the new Poke' bowls are awesome. I had the Mexican bowl. It had sharp lime soy glaze flavor and the tuna was bright red, fresh and tasted like it was just reeled in from the ocean.

TRY THE NEW POKE BOWLS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. ; )"}
{"text":"This is great food at a fair price in a fun part of town! They did a great job hosting our work party, too."}
{"text":"After having the worst experience at public house upstairs or school whatever it's called we choose this place out of default. But, I am so happy we did! We had a server named Maggie I think which every sweet and full of jokes. We loved her! Gave us recommendations to our foods and drinks. Explained I wanted a mojito but I can't have pineapple (which is what they have on their menu) and she said no problem, I'll substitute it with a splash or raspberry or regular mojito. She made my day. We had about 5-6 mojitos later... Lol we had to cancel our shopping and walk it off a little. The food was delish! Sliders, truffle fries and sushi was A1! Thanks so much for your wonderful service. It was a litttttttle pricey, but I suppose if you want good food with great service ya gotta pay for it. Lol"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time for a work meeting and I really enjoyed it. The service was pretty much excellent, except toward the end, it slowed down a bit. They have a well rounded menu with lots of appetizer and small plates options. I ordered the beef sliders and a california roll. I was in an appetizer mood. They were both very good. One thing about the sliders was that it had a \"juniper mayo\" on them. Every now and then I would really taste the juniper and it would kind of throw me off. Just note that you should read the description before ordering because most of the items have an ingredient that sets it apart from it's similar entrees at other restaurants. 

I would definitely like to try this place again. They especially have good happy hour which is worth trying."}
{"text":"Our server ,Kayla, was an awesome bartender and always made sure we were great ! She was great, very attentive, and the reason we would ever come back! The food was amazing as well :)"}
{"text":"Good food , great atmosphere and very attentive staff, overall a very pleasant experience.
Cheers"}
{"text":"High quality, good food. However, the service is rather lacking and slow. Would come back again"}
{"text":"3 letters... O.M.G.

Crave is a new restaurant inside Downtown Summerlin, and actually its the only restaurant open so far! Ive been here 3 days in a row now and every meal gets better then the last. 
The first time we dined here we were lucky enough to be invited for the Soft Opening. We got to try numerous items from their menu. I loved all of them and a few of my favorite items were:
Chicken Apple Sausage Flatbread- Caramelized red onion, balsamic glaze, manchego, roasted red peppers
Pork Belly Sliders- Kimchi, Korean BBQ sauce, cilantro
Jumbo Shrimp- Spice marinade, flash fried, tzatziki sauce
Lemon Garlic Wings- cucumber, bleu cheese dip
Lobster Linguine- Poached lobster, lightly truffled lemon butter sauce
Strauss® Free Raised® Grass Fed Burger- Foie gras butter, caramelized onions
Aloha Sushi Roll- spicy tuna, mango, cilantro, avocado, poké sauce

We also had an arrangement of cocktails, my favorite was the Candied Carrot Martini. It contained a few different vodkas with fresh pressed carrot juice. YUM!
Our server Jennifer was great, we could tell she was very busy but still provided great service. Probably the best server Ive ever had.

The second time we dined here it was the grand opening. There was a 2 hour wait at the door so we tried our luck at the bar. We grabbed a few seats (we got extremely lucky) and started out with a few wines. They have an amazing hour Pinot Grigio and Merlot. We had the Aloha Sushi roll (again) and the calamari. Andy LOVED the calamari. it had a crispy cornmeal crust and came with  jalapeño aioli for dipping. It was a great twist on the classic calamari dish. Although I didn't get any of the bartenders names we again had great service.

And the third time I dined here (this afternoon) Ceasar took great care of us. I came here with a gf and my mother, who has celiac disease. CRAVE has a huge Gluten Free menu! Ceasar even told us that they take celiac so serious that the chef who makes any gluten free item even changes their coat, gloves and apron to keep from cross contamination. We were so impressed by this. 
My gf and I started out with the Margarita Flatbread. So amazing!! Each piece had the perfect amount of fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato. 
For entrees my mom had the lemon garlic wings, she loved them as much as I did. I had the  Roasted Chicken. It came with coconut jasmine rice, grilled pineapple relish, fried plantains and was glazed with a jalapeño orange glaze. This is probably my favorite item I've tried here. Its amazing. Jen had the Turkey Burger and she loved that as well. 
I had a blueberry Fizz to drink, it was pretty much a non-alcoholic blueberry mojito. 

This is probably my new favorite restaurant in the Summerlin area. We've dined here 3 times in 3 days, and enjoyed each experience. So happy to have a place like Crave right up the street!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to crave for the first time on a Friday night date. The restaurant was full at 6:30 but we had made a reservation so we got right in.  I decided to go to the sushi bar.  I should have known when not one person was at the sushi bar that something was up.  We ordered tuna and a spicy roll of some sort and  It just wasn't fresh or very tasty.  We were so disappointed.  Giving it one more chance, we ordered one order of salmon and another type of tuna sushi and both were just OK.  

On another note, the service was great from the server that brought our wine.  I will return to the restaurant for their regular menu as it does interest me but I will not return for sushi.  

Oh, one more thing, there was no soy sauce at the bar.  After asking for some low sodium, the server came and poured a way too generous amount in our dishes.  He sould know to let the customer do that, as we like to get a certain amount in the dish to get the consistency right with their wasabi."}
{"text":"First time coming to Crave and I don't know why it's taken me this long to try this place. Cassandra was our server and she was so kind and recommended the best items. The food was fantastic! We ordered a mix of sushi and sliders and everything was delicious. We ordered the wings and calamari for appetizers. The sauce that came with the calamari was not the regular marinara sauce. It was better! Sushi was also great. I don't know why this restaurant doesn't have higher ratings because I have no complaints from our visit. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place at the Downtown Summerlin Farmer's Market several weeks ago when these girls under a tented area gave us samples & a flyer. The flyer said there was a \"date night\" for couples & it was $50. I told my boyfriend we should give it a try sometime.

Fast forward to this past weekend, Saturday night, I called to make sure they still have that dinner date deal & they said its on Friday & Saturday nights, perfect! 

We headed there and were greeted immediately upon arrival. We were seated at a booth and handed menus. We took a look at the date deal and were ready to order. The date deal consists of 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, & 2 mini desserts PLUS a bottle of wine (21+ for the wine though). That was such a good deal! 

We ordered our food and took in our surroundings. Dim lighting, nice ambiance, with a bit of an elegant feel to it. All of the staff that helped us that night were friendly & didn't rush us with the check, which I liked a lot.

Our food was DELICIOUS! We we definitely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say about CRAVE?  I can't say that I'll CRAVE it anytime soon.  To me, this will be a go to spot if it were the last option ever.  I was told by family that this was a good place to eat.

The hostess was friendly and sat us a few minutes upon arrival.   Then greeted by our waiter a few min later.  He asked us if we had any questions on the menu and my friend asked about their rice bowls, and he had to go ask someone about the ingredients, one time was okay, but 2nd time he had to go ask, it just felt like he don't know the menu all too well.  Or am I just being too critical?  Okay, let's skip that....

According to the waiter, we came on a \"slow\" night.  So, I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but our food came out FAST!  It didn't even feel like ten minutes before it even came out.  I ordered the Chicken Caprese Pasta.  Flavoring was great in the pasta as well as the flavor in the chicken, but what was bad about all this was the temperature of the pasta.  It was in between cold and luke warm.  How is that possible... it just is.  Some bites that I took was just cold.  The chicken was cooked in a bread crumb/tempura batter and honestly the presentation of the chicken looked burned.  It was a dark brown color, and I was expecting it to be a golden brown color.  My friend order the Thai Curry Shrimp bowl.  It came with three jumbo shrimps.  For the cost of $16 dollars, you would think you'd get a little bit more shrimp.  So if we broke it down, it was around $5 something per shrimp with a side of rice and curry sauce.  Yep, that sums that up.  I honestly would have been better off at an Olive Garden.  At least they served bread with my meal.  

The server that we had, we'd be in the middle of a conversation and he'd reach over and fill our cups with water and MY CUP WAS STILL FULL!!! He did that several times!  Which started to bug me because my cup didn't need any water.  When we were finished eating, we were still talking and when my water was actually empty, he NEVER came back once to fill it up or offered to fill it up!!! WTH!!!! The whole time I DIDN'T need water he was trying to fill my cup and when I NEEDED water, he didn't even bother filling it.  

If you do try this place, I truly hope you all have a better experience than I did.  With that being said... Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"A lot of mixed reviews , but me and my husband loved it! First time here , got a coupon 1 entree 2 one free. And it was worth it! Everything was excellent , seated very nicly, waiter was super friendly! Should get a raise ! Very patient , explained everything so clearly, the best way to use the coupon . And which is the best meal of all to the least hahah , very truthful! Had the scallops and husband had steak (forgot the name but was $31)by our waiter recommend and it was amazing !!!! Loved it ! Steak was juicy and soft , scallops with nice flavors. And the waiter was awesome and nice ! Very cool place !  Overall excellent place! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and enjoyed the food and service both times. I had the same hostess both times I ate there and she was very courteous and respectful. For my first dining experience I had Channelle as my waitress. She was awesome! My drinks never got empty and she knew the menu quiet well. I'm not a sushi fan but she recommened I try it. I ventured out and tried the King Kong sushi and loved it! The pineapple baked chicken was a little dry but it  was very flavorful. However, the water was stale and gritty. I think a high end water filtration system might improve the taste.

My second trip I tried the guacamole and apple sausage flatbread. Both dishes were very good. I also had the bread basket. Although it was only $3 it would have been better if it was free. The pan bread and crispy flatbread were delicious with the homemade garlic butter. However, I was not a fan of the baked bread. I had Michael as my server this time and he was on point! He never let my drink get empty and put the order in so I didn't receive the appetizer with my meal. (I appreciate that).  

All in all this restaurant  has very flavorful food that is not too filling and serves much healthier food than many of the other  places in Vegas. I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok.... Very fishy taste for some reason.....Serivce however was great.... The drinks served were horrible.... Probably would not recommend..... Next ..."}
{"text":"The place was not even half full and it took almost 15 minutes to get a drink from the bar.  Service was very poor in general.  I had the lamb meat balls for twenty some dollars and was less than impressed.  There were only a few and were only an inch or so in diameter. Others had the bison burger which was ok,  but it is hard to mess up a burger. With all the great dinning options in town I doubt I will go back and will not be recommending this place to anyone.  Oh and their largest beers are small and over priced as well."}
{"text":"Giving three stars because the service was fantastic. Otherwise would be a two. Michael was our server. He was honest and had a sense of humor which can be an issue in these parts. 
Ordered the jambalaya. Was forewarned there were better items on the menu, but that's why I we stopped in after viewing menu outside. It was more like a salty tomato base with sausage and shrimp and minimal seasoning, lacking in flavor. Dish came out lukewarm with indications of having had a visit in the microwave from the uneven heat around the plate. Fish tacos were good. Coconut jasmine rice good too. Neither out of this world. Average. Had a ginger vodka drink which was decent.

I'd perhaps return for drinks and apps but the menu has an identity crisis and still manages to have nothing that stands out. Basic Americana fare with a sushi kitchen. Not an original idea, but catchy perhaps to some. Will try the other places in Dtwn Summerlin before heading back."}
{"text":"The service is great, everything from the water being refilled to the taste of the fresh fish, exceptional service from walking in all the way to walking out. Our server was named Craig and he really went above and beyond to make sure we were happy!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves in this Downtown Summerlin Mall (because we were staying right next door at the Red Rock Resort) and just picked this place at random. Walking in, I noticed how clean and well-decorated the place was. Very clean lines and appealing.

We sat down and I put my service dog under our table. My girl had the grilled cheese sandwich and I had the chicken & avocado salad with an order of Unagi (sushi). The grilled cheese comes on a rectangular dish with six triangular wedges and a cup of tomato-based soup for dipping. Really tasty. My eel sushi was baked to perfection and quite tasty. My salad was so fresh and delicious. It was SO refreshing in this utterly ridiculous heat and humidity. 

Our server was attentive and friendly. I really have no complaints. The food was unique and quite fresh. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Our server was Jordan tonight he was AMAZING and was on top of everything. This is our first time here and he checking up on us so often. Food was delicious. Jordan recommended the 702 burger and it was to die for. 
Overall, this visit was worth it. And if you come here ask for JORDAN"}
{"text":"This midwest chain recently opened in the new Downtown Summerlin complex. It claims to be chef driven -- and maybe it is -- but the quality and execution is on par with similar chain restaurants. The duck confit flatbread ($15.95) was one of the more interesting sounding dishes, but there wasn't enough duck to balance out the sweetness of all the fig marmalade. The lemon garlic wings ($13.95) were huge, but the heavy lemon flavor made them unappealing. The Crave burger ($13.95) wasn't bad. It's a simple burger made up of an angus patty, smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion and their signature burger sauce. The undercooked and under seasoned patty were the only thing holding it back from being a decent burger. Desserts fared much better. Although for someone with a sweet tooth like mine it's tough to screw up chocolate cake ($7.95) -- five layers of dense, moist, sweet chocolate cake. It was, however, lacking a sufficient amount of the orange creme anglaise mentioned on the menu. The S'mores brownie ($7.95) had some enticing elements like the chewy brownie and the marshmallow ice cream, but the amount of torched marshmallow topping the brownie was overload.

With so many other places in town to try, I'm not sure I'll return. Sure, they have a large menu, which also includes sushi but the combination of that and American food in the same restaurant is an even bigger deterrent to my return.

2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Great place to come for the variety of foods! This place is a good place to come for large groups because everyone can have what they want. I had the raspberry lemonade cocktail and it was great, not a bad drink menu Crave! The filet with crab meat on top was awesome,  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a light surf n turf with a cream sauce."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  Place was esthetically great, but to bad the food did not look or taste as good!  Very disappointed with the selections had.  Started with a blueberry lemonade which was good, but not the best I ever had. It was more of a mojito and I'm never one to hate in a good drink.  Moving on to the Crab-cakes with jalapeño sauce. They were a bit on the sweet side and the jalapeño was very, very lacking.  The salad with baby greens and tomatoes was good.  Then we ordered the pork belly sliders.  Huge disappoint and maybe I'm just spoiled ( I blame a certain somebody for that) but none the less pork belly was a little to chewy for my taste and the garnish in it has a refrigerator taste.   The Kobe beef tacos were actually one of the better items. If you order this is probably a must just ask for garnish in side as it made the tacos soggy, but the meat was cooked well and very tasty.   And last but not least the Mac and cheese with sausage was good.......yes, here it comes it lacked salt or some sort of a step up to make good and something worth recommending .  The sad part is after i posted I was here then I got comments that this was not the place to eat. To say the least I feel like I spent money for something I didn't enjoy.   Our server was nice and accommodating and that is the reason they get two stars.  This place seems to have potential , but food needs a bit of a rework and the presentation needs to be part of that stepping it up!!"}
{"text":"My birthday lunch with friends couldn't be more perfect. Every item ordered was raved about by all. My crabmeat eggs Benedict, Hollandase sauce on the side, was Devine. Thanks to Richard, our Server, we had endless Mimosas and discounts as well. The Manager brought out my birthday cake, making it a perfect celebration. Thank you Richard and CRAVE! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We weren't impressed... Definitely not chef quality!!! The calamari was either old, overlooked or both. The lamb meatball/fettuccine dish was heavy, with the pasta all stuck together, plus over spiced.  The salad and desert were very good if that's any consolation.. Ambiance was nice and service was superb, friendly and accommodating. The wait wasn't long, now we know why?

We give it 2 stars, but we will try again. Always give a place a second chance to redeem itself, one can only hope.  For the money we would have expected a lot better...:( :("}
{"text":"I have never had such poor service when sitting at the bar.  I had to ask three times for a glass of water; once when I ordered my drink, once when the bartender gave me my drink, and finally to who appeared to be the assistant bartender.  I even had to sit and wait, with empty plate and glasses in front of me, and finally ask for my check even though I had told the bartender I was done when he asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my food.  Besides those times I, along with the other three ladies at the bar, was mostly ignored.

The kicker is they weren't all that busy with it being past the lunch rush and before dinner.  Hell, while I was sitting there waiting with my wallet in front of me the assistant went and started to chop lemons instead of asking if I needed anything. The food and drink were good which is why they get two stars and why I'll probably give them a second chance sometime.  But it won't be soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a Sunday dinner with a friend a couple of weeks ago. I am trying not to eat a lot of carbs so I ordered a salmon dish with vegetables and it was really good. They've got Michelob Ultra on tap and great happy hour specials. 

My one complaint was the hostess stand. We waited for about 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and get us seated and when she did she did not comment on the lengthy delay. If this had not happened I would have given them four stars.

I would definitely go back for the cocktail menu alone. Some of them looked amazing. Very creative. It's a casual place with TVs in the bar area, but it's nice. I think that it would be a good place to meet for a drink or a full meal."}
{"text":"1) Front desk girls are TERRIBLE! 40 min wait at lunch with tables open. 

2) The servers are COMPLETELY CLUELESS! 

3) The managers look LOST! 

4) The bar is a constant mess and totally unorganized! 

5) The food is better at Olive Garden! 

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!! 

I promise you will regret it!!! 

They will be out of business by this time next year!



LOL....I received a \"compliment badge\" by someone from CRAVE and they tried to get rude because I left a negative review!!! Lmao!!! How about you educate your staff, instead of arguing with your customers! You asked me if, \"I knew how to run a restaurant\" in your rant....I'm a JWU graduate...and I clearly know more than you! I had one of the worst dining experience in your establishment! You can look at my record here on YELP...I rarely complain! So please stop harassing customers Shawn and focus your time on improving your Yelp rating! 

Thanks  lol"}
{"text":"The setting is nice, waitress, Erica, was really nice. We ordered the sweet peach tea, wasn't impressed. The crab artichoke dip was ok. The roasted chicken breast was very dry and flavorless, I couldn't even finish it. The mahi mahi was flavorless and was not finished. Will never go back or recommend. Worst place I have eaten at in a long time. Wasted $70."}
{"text":"Walking around Downtown Summerlin we decided to have some lunch. So many good options in the area we decided to try Crave after looking out their menu.

A place that is bigger on the inside than it appears from outside, we were seated right away at a table just off of the bar. Our server who was also the bartender was very attentive to our needs and others in the area, she worked the area very well.

I had the Caprese flatbread and the calamari. The calamari was nice and not over battered and accompanied by a jalapeno aioli that was perfectly spiced, not overbearing. The flatbread was thin, crispy with original caprese ingredients with some avocado as a bonus."}
{"text":"Very pretty environment. Food is secondary to a cool vibe of a restaurant in downtown Summerlin. It does try to do too many things, and be all things to all people. It would go up in stars with a bit more focus. It is hard to be an \"American kitchen\" and a \"sushi bar,\" too. It's as if you started a \"Soul Food\" restaurant that also did Chinese food. Not impossible. But you would not be surprised if it were a bit...odd. As this place is. But if you end up here, or find yourself here, you will not be unhappy if you keep a perspective. Also, the buffet is not bad at all. I came to their buffet with my mother and mother-in-law (as it was too late to get reservations anywhere because we did so spontaneously) and we had a BALL!"}
{"text":"Damn....What can I say. Bad service. (45 mins) for a drink. No acknowledgement. Yea not good. We gave this place a 3rd shot....As they say. 1, 2, 3 Strikes your OUT!! Never again. Sorry not sorry. Shake Shack it is!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for quite sometime. However, with poor Yelp reviews and a discouraging word from my parents that it wasn't good and over priced I had mixed feelings. When a meetup group scheduled a lunch here I thought I'd give it a try before planning to go with my husband and having a bigger tab.  Meh, nothing special about their Sushi Lunch Combo and service was poor. For 13.95 it came with miso soup, a skimpy spicy salmon roll and 5 nigiri. We were a group of 9 in the corner and server never came around to refill beverages and the restaurant had barely any guests. My glass of water was low and I slurped the remains of melting ice when we left. Sometimes with larger groups I wonder if servers feel more relaxed about providing excellent service because they know there is a high likelihood the total tip is going to be pretty good. I am usually a very generous tipper (18-25%) but not today. No one at our table raved about their selection. If you want sushi, this isn't the place to get your \"fix\"!"}
{"text":"Went to Crave for dinner. Nice gluten free menu. Also free kids meal with an adult meal. Very nice option. My mean was wonderful and my son had chicken fingers. He said they were not good. Maybe the free is the reason. Otherwise would have been a 5 star. I'd rather pay for his meal and Amy e reduce main entree slightly in cost and get better quality kids food. My son is not picky. 

Service was wonderful and the environment is wonderful."}
{"text":"Located in downtown summerlin catering to both American cuisine and sushi lovers alike is Crave. We had a wonderful dinner here on Friday night. The service was good despite some minor things like not cleaning up our plates before our entrees so we just pushed our appetizers and dishes over to the other side of the table where they say for the rest of the meal. The food was delicious and filled a sushi craving. 

Mom Rating 4/5 
It's a spacious enough so I didn't feel like I was a burden with my infant and stroller in tow. The tables were far apart enough that he was able to take a nap without nearby tables waking him up. We would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"If you know ANYTHING about food, don't eat here. The food is mediocre at best. Service is great though."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Good service. Interiors are a dressed up yard house vibe. Mahi mahi and the chicken were fantastic. Bision burger and the sirloin sliders are some of the best around."}
{"text":"They have a good selection for lunch during the weekday. However, their service was just okay. They weren't busy since it was lunch on a Wednesday, but our server took a while to complete our order (he had to go back & forth to the kitchen to clarify a few things regarding the menu).

He might've been new, but my coworkers & I needed our order ASAP since we were there during our lunch break.

Despite this, I ordered the Crave Sliders & they were pretty good. The burger was juicy & buns were similar to a sweet Hawaiian roll. They were quite stingy on the fries though, but they were good. $12.95 for 3 sliders & fries.

Not sure if I'd go here again by choice, but, I'll try to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Drinks and appetizers were great, but the Mac and Cheese with Andouille Sausage was horrible, no flavor or cheese taste. But will try again but something else."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends and family visiting from out of town. The food was good. Our service was just okay though; didn't spill one drink, but two drinks at different times, and we never received any refills on water."}
{"text":"We really like this place!  The truffle parmesan fries, delicious, the Korean chicken bites, delicious, the pulled pork nachos, yesssss.  The server was excellent and quick.  The cocktails were very good.  The ambiance is nice, inside and outside seating, large spacious place.  None of us eat sushi, so have no idea how that is, but the cooked food was awesome.  We are definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Wait staff was really nice, but the whole place was really disorganized. We were brought to our table which already had people seated at it, then, it was right by the kitchen which was very crowded and the wait staff was clearly didn't know the layout of the restaurant yet. The beer they brought me was warm from the tap and the food I ordered was way too spicy and the lamb meatballs were overly dry. It will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"Totally Average the waiter was really slow and our waters weren't getting filled up. The waiter said that the water person was all over the place. I order a salad and I found a hair. No one even came to a apologize not even a manager no one. If you are reading this that works here please get your act together. Everything was really ok. The only thing that was the best was the blueberry cheesecake. I would totally suggest that. I would totally not come back only for the desert."}
{"text":"we had reservations sunday night showed up and no one waited on us or even acknowledged us. 

we had never tried this place even though we live across the street. we had only heard so so things from friends and after we waited for five minutes we walked out. 

the place was empty and not one person acknowledged our presence. 

what a joke and there was one person who walked out ahead of us obviously with the same issue. 

well now we know never to go back. don't bother going to this place it's a chain and obviously they just don't care. first time we have had to walk out of a restaurant in down town summerlin. 

not one person bothered to even acknowledge our presence. management has a real problem here. 

this is not even a one star rating i had to give something to continue. it's a zero!


updated review 

we went back to try crave after being contacted by someone after previous review. we were met amd sat right away by a very pleasant hostess. place was packed and waitress came right over and took drink orders. 

we had the chicken wings which have to say were excellent some of the best i have ever had. also tried the tuna tataki as i was intrigued that they had so much sushi on their menu. it was good fish was fresh and the sauce was different from what ive had in the past butnit was good. we both had the mac and cheese and it was excellent as well. 

throughout service was good waitress was very friendly and did a good job and managers were active and walking table to table. 

our experience was very good and by reading reviews it would seem maybe some managers are better than others that is the only explanation i can figure for the wide discrepancies in reviews. 

im going back for the wings they were that good! 

i really appreciate the quick response from the restaurant after my first review and their attempt to fix the problems. that was impressive and shows that they do care about their business."}
{"text":"We were here on Saturday night, it was fairly busy but the wait wasn't long and the hostess was very nice (they even opened the door for us). I had the mustard salmon and my husband had sushi both were amazing! The wine selection was also good. The only complaint is it was kind of chilly in the restaurant.,other than that the food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"We went here during the week for lunch and it was great. 

Despite having a bit of a wait to be seated, even with a restaurant full of empty tables, the food was exceptional (we ordered a variety of sushi rolls) and this has by far become my favorite spot for mid-day sushi."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Had the tiniest issue with a cold dish and the staff fell over themselves to resolve it. The manager and the server were extremely attentive. Great great service I would recommend any day of the week."}
{"text":"The food was hit and miss the last time I ventured here.  The service was terrible and the reception was as bad as it can get.  3 minimum wage females with attitude.   I was at a movie and thought I would give it another try.   Hostesses are clueless. ..  the only reason they are busy is the other sit down dining are not open yet.  I walked out as they just don't know how to treat a customer.  No hello, no I will be with you in just a moment,  nothing but attitude.   They were too busy with their chit chat than doing their job.

I predict closure if they don't fix the lack of service as MTO,  California Pizza, Wolfgang Puck and Grape Street will pull 90% of their current business.    

Owner and Management,  make changes before you loose your investment."}
{"text":"The all day Sunday happy hour is awesome! The lemon garlic wings are finger licking good! The Bartender's, Kayla, friendliness and smile truly made my visit!"}
{"text":"Earlier this week, I was taken to this place with a friend while visiting over the Thanksgiving holiday. The food was good, and I wanted to see if they could handle GF since my wife has celiac disease and since the food was good I thought it might be something she could enjoy. Talked with our waitress and she advised that it wouldn't be a problem, great.

Tonight my wife and her friend, were out Christmas shopping, and they decided that they would meet us there. By the time we arrived, my wife and her friend were already seated, and the look on my wife's face wasn't pleasant. She advised that not only wouldn't they be able to serve her a specialty burger on a GF bun, but that even the fries are all cooked in the same oil.  The waitress seemed to do everything possible to talk us out of eating there, she didn't want to be bothered.

So, coupled with the fact that she couldn't enjoy a burger ON a GF bun, they would be having difficulty in handling a dairy allergy. Instead of fries, my wife optioned for the cole slaw, only to be advised that their cole slaw contained dairy as well, meaning that their mayo used to make the cole slaw contained dairy.

I'm not a chef, but I am an experienced cook and in all my 63 years have I never heard of any dairy product used to make cole slaw. I have heard of buttermilk, but that is a rarity. When initially made, the cole slaw is thick, but within a few hours it loosens up.

So if you have celiac disease or dairy allergies, avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately can't speak too much to the food. We waited awhile after being seated. Lots of waiters and no service."}
{"text":"Was taken here by my family for Mother's Day. I was hesitant, because I thought it was going to be geared more for sushi lovers, but my husband assured me it wasn't. We get there, and after our bizarre waitress swings by to state \"I 'll be back\", we review the menus only for me to see that I was right. They have food that isn't sushi, but I don't eat fish or hot, spicy food so that narrowed the choices down a lot. I went with the stir fry that came out cold. I'm not talking warm, it was cold like someone had put it in the refrigerator to cool it off. I was absolutely done at that point. I just wanted the check. We had already discussed where we should've gone. The next evening we DID and had good food, good service, and a great time, so we were able to salvage Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"Great service , excellent food and always open tables .
Would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting downtown summerlin"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome food, great outdoor seating, service is good. Many different food options..."}
{"text":"Always slow service. Waited about 20 minutes to take our drink order. Not even an apology, I asked for a manager and was told one was not available. Since it's a holiday they don't honor specials, but their signs out front say EVERY Sunday. Food is okay, not worth the price."}
{"text":"No Bueno! The food is super expensive and not eatable, the service is mediocre.

Came to Downtown Summerlin to check out what everyone is raving about and decided to eat here because this is the only restaurant without a giant wait and on a friday night it was rather empty. Should have known that there's a reason for that! 

I ordered the salmon Spinach salad was no good. The fish was cooked rare, just the way I like it, but the the spinach was drenched in a pool of salad dressing and soggy. It was a puddle of green mud, and the dressing was sticky and too sugary. Also ordered 4 of the Kogi tacos and they were ok in flavor but Kogi beef is suppose to be big pieces of beef marinated with Korean BBQ sauce, not a puddle of shredded dry beef strings. 

Service was ok, bathrooms clean, parking was not easy."}
{"text":"This would have been a 4 star but we had some service issues. We ordered salads to start, after appetizers, a few drinks then our meal came, I asked about our salads. Said she never put them in...hmmm, kinda of a drag. Was looking forward to a salad. At least she was honest. Also our steaks came with a different veggie than advertised. When asked, she said she didn't know why and brought us the correct veggie (which was cauliflower and was utterly tasteless), so we were glad it came with asparagus instead. The steak medallions were good, as were the roasted new potatoes. That saved the meal, otherwise would've been totally disappointing. To start we had the fried calamari which was actually really good, so that was a plus as well."}
{"text":"CRAVE... I tried to enjoy this place...
We came in to Crave to kill some time before our movie.
This review has nothing to do with wait time...lucky for us there were two seats open  at their bar. The restaurant has a nice vibe...very comfortable. 

Ordered the Kogi beef tacos...
The food runner came out with the tacos and another entree looking a bit lost as to where to deliver it to. After realizing that it was our order, I told him we never ordered the second item so he hands it to the bartender who then passes it around the bar asking if it belongs to anyone. It ended up sitting behind the bar for the rest of the time that we were there. 
Very unorganized system they have going on...

The Kogi beef tacos itself was very bad. I took one bite and passed it off to my friend who eats anything and everything but even admitted that it was pretty terrible. The meat tasted as if it was marinated in butter rather than cooked with it. The bite left a very unpleasant greasy film like taste in my mouth. 
I will not be coming back to try anything else on their food menu."}
{"text":"When I walked in thought it was going to be a bit better then I thought. Service was excellent! But the menu was kinda busy too much fusion food for my particular taste on the menu, kinda got turned away from some of the food on the menu. The menu prices to me were kinda pricey for the type of food. I wouldn't come back too quickly, there is better food in downtown summerlin then this place"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I finally got a chance to try Crave again a few weeks ago for their dinner service thanks to Melissa T. My experience was so much better the second time around! The food was good & the service was excellent. I changed my star review to reflect my second visit; I'm glad I gave them a second chance!


****
We came here on Sunday (5/21) for their all day happy hour only to be told they didn't do that any more. Maybe their menus on the website should be updated then. 

We should have taken that as a sign to leave but we stayed. 

My friend ordered the Crunchy roll & I got the Shrimp & Crab Cake Benedict & we both ordered Bottomless Mimosas. My meal was just ok; I'm not sure how you can replace the english muffin with tomato slices & still call it a benedict but it's whatever. My friend's sushi order was completely wrong; there was no avocado or spicy mayo in it as advertised & it looked like they had added sprouts to it. When my friend told the server she thought the order was wrong, the server tried to argue with her! After consulting the menu, the server took the food back & brought back the right order. We got no apology. We each had two mimosas before we were told they were out of orange juice. It was only a little after 1:45 pm by this time. We also received no refills on our water. 

This experience left a lot to be desired; with so many other, better choices, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious. But what was really impressive is the service we got at the bar. Donnie was all smiles all evening, so was the other lovely blonde lady who was working at the bar. It had been years since I had seen so much good energy and happiness and awesome customer service in action. It made my night. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever tried. Very bad experience. I won't go back. The waiter was great by the way."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour for the first time, really nice ambience inside and calm vibe for the day. I tried out a the Angus Beef sliders, Truffle parmesan fries, Shrimp tempura roll and the Prosciutto & Fig flatbread. 

The food was good but not amazing, the flatbread and the sushi seemed a bit too dry for my tasting. We asked for a side of spicy mayo to add to the sushi and that was a great fix, tasted much better. I think for the flatbread it could've used some olive oil or some sauce for it. The truffle fries could've used more truffle and parmesan but the portion of it was really large and ended up finishing the whole thing anyway. 

Not sure if I would come out of my way to eat here again, perhaps for some cocktails!
Also thanks to Tasha for the great service!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience today at their Mother's Day brunch. Service and food was great, all staff was welcoming, and they even went the extra mile and gave roses out to all the moms. Nice touch! First time at Crave, but will not be the last. Will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was looking forward to trying this place out when it first opened. However, I decided to hold off after reading reviews from fellow Yelpers. Then last month for some odd reason my parents recieved a good amount of gift cards from family and friends. 

The family and I decided to try this place out. Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess and was seated immediately. Water glasses were provided and drinks were serve accordingly. The highlight of our visit was our amazing server, Chyna. Overall, she made our visit a pleasant and memorable one. Everything she reccomended was spot on. A few of the items we enjoyed were the loaded Nachos. This was really consistent with flavor and had an even amount of toppings with the chips. The stellar item was the Lemon Garlic Chicken Wings. Flavor was delicious and wasn't dried out. I would come back for this particular item. We got a few Sushi rolls and they were meh. Nothing to spectacular just average with a nice presentation. Actually presentation is what set this place apart. 

This easily would've been a 3 star rating for me but our server really made a big difference. I would personally come back for half of the Menu and wouldn't come for any of their Asian offering. However, it is a good option when dinning with a group needing a variety of dishes. 

2017 Yelp Review #23"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my girlfriends today...we all thought it was AMAZING!!  From the crab artichoke dip all the way to the end!  Betty took great care of us and suggested the angry dragon for our cocktail.  Talk about hitting the nail on the head!!  It was perfect with our meals.  I had the grilled chicken salad which was presented very well along with everything else we had.  Ended the meal with the individual salty caramel mousse.  YUM!!!  The only thing that made the meal from being perfect is that the website says happy hour is on Saturday from 11 to 5.  We were informed by the hostess that they weren't doing it for opening weekend!!  Bummer!!  We'll still be back!!!  Go quick!!!"}
{"text":"Awful food. We had a party of seven and no one liked what they ordered. The spicy sushi rolls were bland. The beet garnish on the kale and beet salad had a black spot through every slice and the dressing was much too sweet. The pizza was served on a tortilla. The grilled cheese sandwich was without cheese. I do not recommend this restaurant and will not return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had loaded nachos appetizer & the crispy chicken sliders. Nachos were pretty big. The description said pulled pork so I had to try! They were pretty good. But honestly, very little pork & could have used more if the nacho topping goodies on it. My friend loves the sliders so she really wanted to share them. Unfortunately, they were a bit dry. The Siracha sauce was sparse & not one one of three at all. Real bummer! The chicken itself was good, but I wouldn't order again. Lunch pricing was also too high. I was told the happy hour is a great deal & variety. I'll give it another try for that."}
{"text":"This place was such a bad first time experience that I just HAD to write my first review!!! 

First off when you walk in there's a wait just to put your name on the list. They put your first and last name in the system then give you a waiting pager. They seemed so unorganized like they didn't know what they were doing. The wait was an hour long so we decided to walk around downtown summerlin and check it out.. About 40 minutes passed by so we checked to see how much longer. They said about 4 more people were in front of us still so we waited some more.... About 15 more minutes passes by so we check how much longer again and she said 2 more people were still ahead of us but since we were in there she'll just seat us. I don't know if that was a good or bad thing because if she let us cut in front of people imagine how many people she let cut in front of us?! 

So now that we're seated let me say... She gave my boyfriend and I the WORST table. It was so tiny right in between the bar and the bigger tables. We were so close to the family sitting on the side of us. The space was so tight the servers were having a hard time squeezing through to drop off and pick up food. 

Now for drinks I ordered a white sangria. Our server bragged about how delicious and popular that drink was and how I'm gonna love it...... Then he comes back and says they're all out!!! Really?! Got my hopes up! So I went with the blueberry lemonade.. It was good-- super minty from the mint leaves. My boyfriend just got a Stella.. Nothing to mess up there. 

As for food.. The menu was on the pricier side. Their pastas ranged from 20-30$... 18$ for some Mac n cheese!!! They have a sushi side of the menu too but I didn't order any sushi. My boyfriend got the crave burger and the fries tasted over-cooked. The food was just okay. 

Mainly went to check out the new mall and decided we'll stop by and eat there and it was just bad. They are the only restaurant open right now so I understand that's why they were so busy but they just seemed  so unorganized. Probably will give them another shot again like later later once they figure themselves out."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, but for being part of the new downtown summerlin, I can see how they want to cater for a certain crowd.

Came here for an office lunch, we made reservations for 10. Even though we had a reservation and made it on time, we still had to wait 20mins. Not too bad, but you would think they have the table ready for a reservation beforehand. 

The sushi was OK, I had better. I feel it was somewhat plain with the menu only showing the 'standard' specials. Like spicy crunch tuna...etc. nothing too fancy that can be seen as signature. 

As for the entrees, we had a bunch of sandwiches, standard BLT, burgers, etc. the the Kobe burger was the most fancy one. I personally had the sautéed Norwegian salmon. The fish was tender, flavorful, but not dry. The sauce was creamy and perfectly paired with the veggies and fish. I recommend this 100%. For this fish alone, I would come back, my husband likes classic burgers so he is good with that.

The ambiance is nice, very modern, suiting the overall setting of the mall. Only visited during lunch, so we'll see how dinner will be. Perhaps I'll update the review when we have done so with my dinner experience.

Staff was friendly, didn't know the specials, again, went here opening week, so I'm sure everything was new."}
{"text":"Went there to check out happy hour with some friends.. Drinks were good with $4 beers and their ginger beer drink for $7 was tasty. Customer service was great but the rating is based on the food.. Or lack of. The crispy chicken that was $6 looked like someone already ate half of it and it was like a sliver of chicken with bunch of breading.. The sliders came out and there were only 2 and light ingredients. Sushi was also ok, Philadelphia was quite fishy.. Used to salmon having a more buttery taste. We tried out this place during their grand opening but it was a madhouse so don't want to rate on that day. Only reason I would come back is because of their awesome patio seating and to have a few beers.. Other than that, not too crazy about it."}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant sucks had the sushi roll that was bland. Also had some cooked fish dish was was ok at best. The burger was cooked incorrectly and I had to return it. This place is nicely decorated. It was real noisy when we were there. The menu has too many food options they should concentrate on one type and keep the menu simple! $80.00 for  two people dinner and left disappointed!!! I'll take my money elsewhere next time!!!

Definitely won't be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Great Service,  FRESH seafood, great Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out the new Downtown Sunmerlin with a very hungry appetite for much-needed food. We were told the wait at Crave was a 25 minute wait for a table. We put our names down. Granted, Crave was the only sit-down food place open. We waited 30 minutes and went back 2x thinking they forgot about us. Now, it was creeping up to an hour. We waited inside next to the over occupied hostess stations. There were a lot of tables open but, clearly not enough wait staff. After we complained again about our wait time, we FINALLY got seated. By now, it was well over the hour mark. Our waiter was prompt but then dropped a BOMB on us by telling us that the kitchen is backed up and that it will take 45 minutes to AN HOUR to get food!!!!!!! 40 minutes for appetizers!!!! We have literally never stormed out of a restaurant! You would think the 5-6 hostesses they had huddled around the one hostess stand would've warned customers about the kitchen wait time on top of making people wait for their tables!!! So, even if you had a reservation, you would've had to have waited a least an hour for your food, and this includes their sushi menu!!!! Unbelievable. Note to this establishment--make sure to either have enough employees to cater to the influx of curious people coming to check out the grand opening or, don't serve people at all, especially if you make them wait from lunch to dinner time! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to sample the food so, I can't comment on the menu items."}
{"text":"This place is pass you don't need to try. 

The waitress was odd with little knowledge of the menu & was actively eating while she took our order. 

The queso looked and tasted like water. Fish tacos were bland. The worst of the worst was the Negihama Roll, it was rancid ... like rotten fish from a can that I wouldn't serve a cat.

2 stars instead of 1 because the sliders were decent."}
{"text":"Simply not worth the excessive time or the calories. Despite three separate reassurances from our waitress and two managers that a computer glitch was the issue, it took 2 hours for three people to receive some bland sushi (that was not what was ordered - and the spicy tuna roll contained lettuce?!) and the salmon plate. Chopsticks took another 10 minutes.  Each dish finally arrived - in separate 15 minute blocks - and was unremarkable, however, they comped the meal."}
{"text":"Crave is great. We went for dinner early before a movie, so we were one of only a few tables.  Our server was a delight, made great recommendations, and checked in often. All the food was delicious, and I was especially excited about the veggie sushi platter, which was really impressive. Portions are good and not overwhelming.  It is a little on the pricey side, but there are many reasonable options. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We decided to do a late dinner last night.  I had been wanting to come here since it opened and they offer reverse happy hour which is a plus.   For our food my husband ordered the Crave burger with fries.  I ordered the baked mac and cheese with grilled chicken added to it.  We also ordered appetizers.  Now initially our service started out great.  Our server checked on us and brought us the apps in a timely manner.  When he brought our food, mine came out and, my husband only received his burger.  Our server told him that he asked the kitchen to make a fresh batch of fries and that it will be out shortly.  That was great, but why wasn't this done when the order was taken initially?  Ten minutes or so goes by and our server comes back saying he was off, but another server was taking his place.   He introduced her and they both left.  Five minutes or so passed and when our new server comes by she looks at my husband and says, \"Sir, can I get you anything?\". I think to myself, I'm100% sure she see's me here with him, so why not address us both?  My husband mentions his fries never came out so she goes to get them and by now I'm just annoyed that she didn't address us both, nor did she look at me.  I don't know what her deal was, but honestly I was looking forward to going back with friends for happy hour.  Now, not so much. 

Besides the lack of good customer service, the food for okay.  Again, I don't know if we'll go back for a second try or not.  It's a shame too, I thought this would be a good hang out for us aside from Public School."}
{"text":"Crave just makes it to three stars by the grace of a person who walked by and gave me a $10 gift card as he and his party were leaving.  Otherwise, it would be two stars.

I made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived on time.  I accidentally came in the back door via the patio and was shown to the hostess podium by a nice woman hereafter referred to as NW.  After checking in at the podium, and asking to be seated on the patio, NW took me outside and said that all the booths were filled but I could have any table.  I chose a table that was set for only two people to minimize removing place settings.  NW left menus with me and said that my server would be with me shortly.

The server brought the menus and took my drink order.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables he was covering but he eventually came back with my iced tea and took my order.  I asked his advice on the entrée and I took it.

Quite some time went by and NW had come by and said, \"Didn't *server* get here yet.  I told NW that he had taken my order.  After another wait, the server came out with two drinks for another table and my cup of tomato soup.  He first stopped to give the drinks to that table and before he got to me, NW said, \"Didn't he bring your soup?  I thought I saw him with it.\"  I told her it was on his tray and she was happy.

I had just started my soup when NW came out with my entrée.  She apologized for how soon things were appearing.  I was very close to telling her to take it back, but I thought it would sit under a heat lamp and then be brought back out.  I made a split second decision to let her leave the dish with me.

The tomato soup was very good but I wish I had more time to enjoy it but I hurriedly finished it to get to the lamb meatball pasta.  When I tasted the pasta, it was still hot so I cut a little break for that.  Perhaps if the place was busier things wouldn't have been so quick.

The menu describes the pasta this way--poblano cream sauce, red pepper, goat cheese, black pepper fettuccine.  The poblano cream had a nice zing to it and the small amount of goat cheese could be used to cut the heat if you wanted.  The meatballs were kind of dry.  The poblano cream sauce and the pepper fettuccine made the dish, flavor wise.  The fettuccine had become stuck together and I was given no spoon to twirl the pasta on.  Since the soup dish had not yet been cleared, I used the soup spoon to twirl the pasta but it came in very long lengths because of this sticking together.

For dessert, I got their S'mores brownie, a long brownie topped with marshmallow that was brûléed and had three thin ginger snap cookies placed in the marshmallow.  There was also a dip of marshmallow ice cream.  As it turned out, dessert was the best part of the meal.

NW came by a few times to see how things were and my server was around more often as the patio emptied of all patrons except for two dog hugging young women who took up a lot of my server's time.  

For the experience, the food would have been better if it had been timed better.  There's no excuse for NW to bring my entrée when she already knew I had just gotten my soup.  What was she thinking?  

The place is Downtown Summerlin priced (this may become the local version of \"Strip prices) and without the $10 discount card, the place wouldn't merit the 3 stars.  Too bad, because for the most part, the food was good.  They've been open about 6 months and they still don't have their act together.  That's sad.  It's also the only time I'll dine there."}
{"text":"I came to this place after walking around downtown Summerlin. My friend mentioned to me last week that Crave started their Happy Hour. 

At first I was not sure since I had read so many negative reviews about how disgusting this place because this place are pets friendly. As a person who love dogs myself I think it's nice to have place like that around town. 
I also suspected all 8-9 negative reviews might be friends and I think it's not fair for group of friends speaking about business in all negative thought. People should yelp but let's be fair. So that's why I am trying out this place. 

My message to CRAVE employees is... Don't panic guys.... I didn't take my dog with me today! So I have nothing to complain about pet friendly. 

Our server was very nice. Listening to the server from table behind us also told me that everyone are on point for their customer services. I also noticed floor manager were running the food by himself helping out his employees. 

It's a 4 stars since my server forgot my ketchup for my fries but it's not a big deal! I will bring my own package myself next time lol. 

Happy hour.. A nice selections of food and drinks. I started with drink and how fantastic their serve my favorite Bluemoon for $4! during HH. My friend went for Kinky cocktails drink which I think it's great value for $4 as well. 

Fat!!! Chicken wings, Veggie Bruschetta, Tuna roll and Truffle fries are all tasty. 
Will be back again hopefully for date night special dining with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible and rude. The restaurant wasn't all that busy and we waited over 40 minutes to be seated after being told it would be 20 minutes. Once we were finally seated after complaining, the waiter made a rude remark stating \"are you ready to order, since you were such a rush to sit down?\" Once we did order it took over over an hour to receive our food. Let me remind you the restaurant was almost empty by the time we put our order. Throughout the waiting process there was no apologies for the wait time or any asking if we wanted anything while we waiting for our food. You can get great food anywhere, but the service is what keeps me coming back. I will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"Wednesday night we went crave restaurant for dinner after work. In my research they close at 11. We got there around 9pm. Hostess show happy hour just started.food came quickly but 30 min later wireless ask us anything else for last call.... They close at 10pm so we ask box and left ... All food was very salty,sushi rice was hard ... Sea Bass was very good !"}
{"text":"I was excited to try CRAVE on my recent business trip to Las Vegas due to some great reviews I had read of it. I'll have to say that it generally lived up to the hype. With that said, I would not leave the Strip to experience CRAVE -- but if you're in the suburban area around it, it's a wonderful choice for a delicious dinner in a trendy casual place with friendly service. 

The menu is varied with many options including a sushi menu. To some extent, for better and for worse, it feels like a Cheesecake Factory type menu with lots of variety in the cuisine types but at a high degree of quality. I chose the fried calamari at the server's suggestion, and accompanied it with hot marinara. I love any calamari that is freshly battered and not too greasy, and this more than met the test. I really liked the crunchy corn meal batter. I also had the steak sliders for my dinner since I was not too hungry, and I enjoyed them a lot. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce on them, but the steak itself was juicy, tender and came in large chunks on the Hawaiian sweet bread. My friend had the sushi roll and enjoyed it.

Jordan was our server, and our whole table loved him. He was sweet, sincere, and made great recommendations that demonstrated his knowledge and experience of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Loved the pulled park and chicken with angel hair pasta!! Get the chicken avocado egg roll appetizer if you're a guac fan. Busser Felix never let my water go low and Sydnee was a friendly server who helped us out!"}
{"text":"Since my last visit, this place is getting worst food quality sucks! Thd flatbreads seems like it had been waiting for someone to bring it to us, not hot anymore, salad was very soggy. We were just so hungry ... Although our waiter was nice, service is very slow.  I don't think I will return.  Nothing exciting about the sushi, I cud have gone somewhere else. Get rid of the sushi chef, you can do better."}
{"text":"We had a big group of eight at Crave... appetizers, drinks, and entrees. As far as appetizers, the firecracker shrimp was my favorite. The sauce on the shrimp was creamy and super flavorful. The tuna flat bread was a close second... the jalapeños really made the dish. The lettuce wrap appetizers were okay, a little more chewy then I prefer. 
I ordered the raspberry daiquiri made with their homemade raspberry purée. The drink was surprisingly tart. I tried someone else's ginger pear martini which I wish I would have ordered... that was delicious! 
For entrees I ordered the caprese flat bread... the description makes it sound like the whole thing is loaded with tomatoes which it's not. It's tastes good, but I was expecting from the description a pile of tomatoes and it was really just a couple of tiny pieces... kinda like pico de gallo. 
My boyfriend got the miso salmon * salmon anything is usually my favorite... maybe we're spoiled from being from the Pacific Northwest, but the salmon didn't have a lot of flavor and the veggies were kind of transparent and oily.  Order the flat bread stay away from the salmon."}
{"text":"Amazing service and excellent quality food.  The menu variety is also a huge plus.  Our server was very friendly and made great recommendations.  The management is very customer focused and the entire experience from host to check was superior in every way.  A truly premium experience with an incredibly warm and friendly approach.  I would highly recommend you skip the chain brands nearby and give Crave a chance.  You won't regret this experience!"}
{"text":"Crave is not bad, but I'm not craving Crave

Crave is located on the northern part of downtown Summerlin. The decor is modern and trendy with bar high stools, booth and table seating for groups.

We ordered up a few beers on tap, Kona Brewing is always a good choice. The sushi menu was good, but really nothing that jumped off the plate to make it stand out over your local sushi hole in the wall. The calamari starter was a decent serving and something I would recommend.

The service was great, our server ran through the menu lighting fast and offered up some really interesting choices from the sushi menu.

Downtown Summerlin has some great options to choose from either for lunch or dinner. With no disrespect to Crave but i believe it falls in the middle of the locations you can choose from. If you have not been, Go try it out 

Overall:
Food: 3-5
Drink: 3-5
Service: 4-5
Coming back: sure"}
{"text":"They were so busy at the bar we didn't want to order food as it would probably took forever, as it took a long time for us to finally place drink and appetizer order, however i tried their food couple times in the past and it was ok, we got some appetizers and the lavender & champagne cocktail which is super amazing. Nice place to spend friday night"}
{"text":"Me and my wife on search for new restaurant so we found this place and for sure we'll planning to come back! 
Good food and health too and fast service  
Nice and quiet so it's a good recommendations for anyone"}
{"text":"Tried the hot hot hot burger and loved it! The quinoa salad was amazing!!! The pickled peppers they add on the side are a perfect touch and also delicious. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm very impressed.  Great atmosphere great sushi.  Had the aloha roll (it was awesome).  Very diverse menu so the no -sushi crowd can be happy while we dig in.  Sake menu limited but great  drink menu.  Fresh, quality, size of the nigiri.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today.  I was disappointed there was no more outdoor seating (not their fault at all it was a pretty day!)  My girlfriend and I started with the duck confit flatbread.  It had arugala, pistachios, halved grapes, and a fig spread along with duck.  The flatbread was actually good.  It had a very thin crust that was not over-cooked.  Then I had the kobe tacos.  I wasn't too impressed with it, though the spicy-type Caesar that came on the side was very good.  Something with the tacos- idk, needed less meat (I can't believe I am saying this,) and more vegetables in it for a crunch.  It just was a very runny taco I guess.  I didn't think the meat was too fantastic so I guess that's why I would have liked more vegetables in it.  Our service was OK.  I don't know that I'd come here again.  The price compared to the food isn't exactly spot on though it is a very pretty place.  Too many other places in Summerlin I would rather spend money at and could get a better meal for the same price.  If you eat here note that half the menu is Mediterannean inspired and the other half is sushi- a weird combination but you definitely get more choices."}
{"text":"Had another visit for Fathers Day dinner and was somewhat disappointed.  Service left a lot to be desired when you have to ask 4 times for water... The prime rib special was the poorest cut of meat possible and not worth the money. 
The pesto chicken was very good and baked mac n cheese ok."}
{"text":"Not so impressed.  The place has an identity problem.  Burgers to tacos to sushi to pasta, and you're not really good at any of them.  That's the problem.  Waited 25 minutes for our food.  Wife ordered pulled beef tacos and I got the chicken caprese pasta.  Pasta was over cooked so a little mush (angel hair).  Hair tacos were nothing special.  The flour tortilla was dry and a little hard.  Our tempura appetizer was mushy and, again, not great.

Good place to get a drink maybe, but not so much for dinner."}
{"text":"What a disappointment Monday's 1/2 price sushi night was. I visited this location twice and on my first visit I had great service, beer, sushi (California roll) & wings.

Today, on 1/2 price sushi night there is a specialty menu with different sushi items to choose from. To name a few there is spicy tuna roll, crunchy roll & veterinarian options. I tried the crunchy roll and it was okay, nothing spectacular. 
The have a nice selection of tap beers and wines and the servers are nice and helpful. 

My fiancé had the spicy tuna roll, & the 702 burger and he loved it. I ordered wings but sadly they were all out. :( 
I'm not sure how you can be all out of wings on a Monday but they were.  Nothing on the menu really stood out for me to try except the crab artichoke dip, but it's to big of a portion for myself alone. 

I'm not sure if I would want to return to crave. I'm gonna do some searching around or other sushi restaurants. I would have rather had the buffet at red rock than my food tonight."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a few lunches and a happy hour here with the girls but last weekend my boyfriend and I came here for a wonderful dinner.  5 stars for the atmosphere, service, bottled wine menu, crab and artichoke dip (with chunks of crab!), sea bass, and pork tenderloin dinner.  The only thing I would not repeat is the caesars salad.  The only thing it had in common with a traditional caesars salad was the lettuce."}
{"text":"Randomly chose to try this place after visiting downtown Summerlin and viewing the menu.
The ambiance of the place is fun but without making into a 'club restaurant' and the front end staff was very friendly.  (You can leave your phone number and they'll text you when your table is ready if you want to walk around the shops)

We ordered the truffle fries, the chicken-apple & brie sandwich and baked penne.  The food came out fast and we were happy with how everything came out.  Our waitress was friendly and checked on us a few times to make sure we had everything we needed"}
{"text":"Food was 3 stars. I got the lemon garlic chicken and it was ok. Service here is terrible. Who hires these waiters. All they do is hang out and chat with eachother. Took me 25 minutes to get my check. Never coming back, thanks to the idiots that work here."}
{"text":"My party of 4 was told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table. Since it was opening weekend that didn't seem so bad. The whole front desk situation was pretty disorganized and chaotic.
While waiting, I asked to use the restroom and walked through a half empty restaurant which we were told was due to a \"shift change\".
We were finally seated right next to the open kitchen and placed our orders. Plates that were out when we first sat down were waiting for a least 30 minutes before they were finally thrown away. In fact, by my estimation, at least (and probably more) than half of the food put out was thrown away because it sat too long. This didn't make much sense because there were tons of wait staff standing around waiting for plates that were never passed to them. 
I can't speak about the quality of the food because after an hour we never received our food. I had a hard time sitting any longer watching food get thrown away while we waited. 
Crave is the only restaurant open at Downtown Summerlin which seems like it would put them in a great position. If they don't get their act together then I don't see them still being open in 6 weeks when all the other restaurants open."}
{"text":"We ordered widmer hefeweizen beer- this is awesome, slightly sweet. 
Lamb meatballs on peppercorn linguini.
Mac & Cheese w/ French fries 
Dessert Sampler- tiramisu, butter scotch pudding, blueberry cheesecake, French silk, rum butter cake, salted caramel pudding. Our favorite was the cheesecake- the rest were cloyingly sweet. 

Good service, and pretty good prices too. The creamy pasta sauce was rich, which went well with the gaminess of the lamb meatballs. The French fries were well-seasoned, but a tad bit salty. The Mac & cheese was a bit 'gabby' (according to my daughter) but overall pretty good"}
{"text":"I came here for a salad and it fed my craving. Next time I'll try the sushi. Ambiance is nice, staff is friendly and food quality was good. I appreciate it was in the shopping center. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"I came here for Mother's Day with family. I give it a one star because of the service. I ordered the 702 burger and it was good but the service wasn't to par. Seating was fast our waiter was horrible. Pretty much didn't see him. We ordered our drinks and they came. I didn't have a problem going to the bar and getting lemon wedges that we had asked for... But when I got to the bar to ask the guy if they had bloody Marries along with my wedges he said yes and needed to see our ids witch I didn't have a problem with but when I turned to get my mom and dads ids he told me the server would help me with that... I didn't want to order from our server because he wasn't tentative as it was... So I said forget it no bloody marries I figured their lose... Also my dad ordered a salad and his burger came before his salad.like I said the food was good, the atmosphere is nice but the service is terrible... I don't know if I will be coming back... Pretty much killed my vibe..."}
{"text":"This was a really good place to go for dinner. My wife and I went yesterday and ordered Bourbon NY Steak, dynamite and Tuna 2 times sushi, firecracker shrimp, cheese curds and fig and prosciutto flatbread. 

We walked in and there was two other groups in front of us. The hostesses seamed to take for ever to seat us but not a big deal we finally got to sit down. The waiter was nice and ordered our drinks really quick along with bringing them to us. Perfect start so far. They have a happy hour menu that is amazing. Normally it seams that happy hour menus are lacking good food but this one killed it. Happy hour starts at 5 on Sunday until close. 

The biggest disappointment was it took about 45 mins for our appetizers to come out. We had the cheese curds and firecracker shrimp for the appetizer. Once we got the food it was really good. 

The main course took another 30 mins after that to come out. I got the NY steak and a sushi roll and my wife got a flatbread and sushi roll. The server walked back by after dropping the food off and asked how it was before we even had a chance to try it. Then he was never seen again after that until it was bill time. The steak was over cooked for my liking.  There were burnt sides of the steak. This was a $30 steak and wasn't worth it at all. The glaze on the steak was really good. The other food was great!  

We will more than like go back and try it again but will stay away from the over priced, disappointing steak this time."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a happy hour meetup. I ordered some sushi. I love sushi, but it is not so fresh here. I am not sure why I expected it to be good. I did really like the brownie desert. I can't remember the exact name. I shared it with some friends, but we also found a piece of hair in the ice cream. Buzz kill. ha. I am not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"We frequent here quite a bit since we live down the street, and always sit at the bar. All the bar staff is fantastic, but today Cassie was awesome. Great recommendations and she even offered us a 'jumbo' shot. Which is like a double but only $2.50 more.  We've been coming here for over 2 years and never even knew about it. Great job at upselling! :) Truffle fries are great, we also had a special lamb meatball appetizer with tzatziki that was really good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went for Happy Hour. 5 tables around us got seated after us and got their food and we had to ASK our server where ours was. Food came out and was clearly sitting under heat lamps for a while. Never had refills on drinks. As we left multiple tables weren't even bussed. Only giving 2 stars because HH prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Couple weeks ago, my wife and I had a bad experience at the hostess stand and after alerting management to our concern they went a above and beyond to apologize and took our concern seriously. We returned today for happy hour and it was awesome!  From the bartender to management to the HH specials =  5 stars. Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"We had a buy 1 entree, get 1 free coupon and it was well worth it. Girlfriend had the Sea Bass and I had the Beef Tournedos (filet medallions). Both meals were excellent. I think they may have been a little understaffed on this night but our waitress was moving as fast as possible. The Tournedos were served with mashed potatoes and asparagus with a peppercorn sauce for the meat. Meat was tender and tasted great. The sea bass was served over rice with a pesto sauce. I had a bite--flaky and excellent flavor. The place was hopping this night. We were very pleased with the meal. Couldn't beat the 2 for 1 deal either."}
{"text":"Pretentious restaurant serving mediocre food. The burger was good, but nothing spectacular.  Charging for a bread bowl of focaccia, pita, and a small shot glass of olive oil.    Friend had the Mac and cheese.   Was bland and needed spice.   Other friend ordered bison burger.  Was told 5 minutes later they were out of it. At 2 pm?????  You've only been open 3 hours and already out if your signature???   Poor planning.   Restaurant was noisy.

Fried ordered desserts to go.  Desserts took over 15 minutes to come out.   Slice of chocolate cake and a slice of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Thank you, CRAVE for making our Valentine's Day perfect! The restaurant's appearance was very upscale, clean and classy. The whole atmosphere was sophisticated. Beautiful hostesses waiting to greet you, awesome waiters, and delicious food! My husband and I had the Valentine's Pre Fixe Menu for two. All I can say is,\"Mmmm\"... Completely satisfied with everything from the appetizers down to the dessert! My daughter ordered the bamboo bites (sushi) and crab cakes, both exceeded our expectations. We were really impressed to see how well the whole staff seemed to operate on such a busy night. Shout out, to our waiter Victor, for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience at Grape Street Café my husband and I walked to Crave Restaurant in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Im so glad we didn't settle for rudeness at the other place. At CRAVE we were met by courteous smiling hostesses Chelsa and Kayla who in tandem took our requests and sat us outside under the stars.
 Crave has a menu called \"DATE NIGHT\". We loved the food choices and the bottle of wine that was included in the rate. And then much to our surprise we were greeted with a 5 star server. Her name was Maggie T. and right from the beginning she seemed delighted to serve us. Her 5 star demeanor lasted throughout our meal. By the way, not only was the service great for a mall restaurant the food was delicious! We had the pleasure to be served by Jennifer Lapadu; a Manager at Crave. I shared my delight with the service and asked if she could share their names. As much as I share honest and truthful negative experiences it is much more important to shed light on servers who do their jobs so well..it even makes the food taste better!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Downtown Summerlin.  I have not been a big sushi fan but I am turning around with the help of CRAVE and it's wait staff.  Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly and decently good with drink service. Food took forever and the portions were small. Ordered off the happy hour menu and it looked like a half portion for half price. Food was below average. The happy hour beer prices were decent. The mixed drinks were watered down and  came in like a 8 oz cup mainly ice. 

Outdoor patio was nice"}
{"text":"Came here the night before Christmas while in town, and it was amazing. We ordered sushi, and the bison burger among other things and everything was amazing! The service was amazing and for Wednesday night it was half off bottles of wine which we didn't know till the End! Will definitely come back when in town! My family loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. It is an outstanding experience to eat and enjoy this place. You should only rate if you know what you are talking about and not be a whinny little bitch worried about the petty little crap. Good place to take anyone on a crazy yummy meal."}
{"text":"Just checking up on my yelps and a follower asked me where I've been and I remembered a yelp I forgot to do so for all my fellow yelpers out there that want a great place to dine and amazing service crave is a great spot to check out. I'm actually surprised and shocked on the amount of good places to eat in this downtown Summerlin but wow crave is definitely a shoe in to take first place. Everything about the place is 5 stars even the bathrooms. I usually hate waiting but when Miranda is on I have someone to talk to that'll make time fly by and somehow she can deal with all my questions and still take care and give other guest 5 star service she's an excellent person to have for when you first walk in. The shoe in for greatest sever alive and the most personable server I ever met is Mikey D. Not only does he remind me of home but he makes me feel like I have a great friend every time I step in to the place and I have been here plenty of times happy hour wings is something I live for some days. There a lot of great servers on but when I come and he's on that's who we will request. For the days we come in and we want the bar there's only one person we want back there and that's Andrea she has the most amazing wonderful personality and her smile can move mountains. The fact that she can keep up with all of these different conversations and still have positive input and feel like she's just part of your group makes me salute her. Crave you definitely have an all star cast and as long as you keep on with your 5 star employees which everyone is you'll stay on top of my list. Thanks for being a great place to be"}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin. Sushi and burgers on the same menu!?! Why? You may be asking! Why Not! Is my reply. There is something for everyone here. Everything was fresh, the service was very good. So what else are you asking for? Reasonable prices? You got it. So take a break from shopping, stop in and enjoy yourself. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Wasn't amazing, I ordered the Mexican sushi roll and didn't like it. There was no flavor in it at all. Then I got the lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Those are definitely better at P.F. Chang's. Personally I don't think I'd be returning. Service was good but the food wasn't. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"First time here...has a Yard House feel to it but different twist...

Ordered the bread basket and it was delish but wished it was unlimited...

The sushi menu is eclectic and overpriced (way better sushi places in town) so definitely don't recommend that side of the menu to splurge on.

Now the ribeye and scallops were delicious...especially the ribeye prepared with the chili molasses glaze...2 thumbs up!

Would come back here again to enjoy and hang out with friends in such a nice atmosphere! :-)"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for at least ten minutes with no service. 
Finally got a beer. Ten more minutes pass and no contact with the happy hour bartender. Finally had to leave. Very disappointed. First time and probably last time."}
{"text":"Lunched here on a Thursday. Quite busy, but seating was very efficient and took less time than estimated (about 10 minutes). Service was superior (Craig rocks!), and food was very tasty. I had the premium bento box with dynamite roll while the wife had the Chicken Apple Brie sandwich. They even brought a complimentary cup of fresh fruit for our daughter!  Can't wait to try this place for grownup night out with drinks as the bar and wine selection looked quite impressive.  The manager made his rounds while we ate which is somewhat rare nowadays. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow....had the sushi boat with friends. Hiroki is the man that created this masterpiece. There are lots of other goods things to eat too. This place is beautiful.i also had the lettuce wraps. You gotta try this place. The desert and drink menu is top notch."}
{"text":"Great experience. Had a group of 15 family and friends. They treated us wonderfully, the menu offering had something for everyone from Sushi, to Steaks, Seafood, Salads, and many more options. Allergy and Gluten issues were catered to, and the service was excellent. Marco the waiter was awesome. Very informative and patient and appreciative. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are going to offer a gluten-free or \"gluten-sensitive\" menu then make sure that the items on it are actually so. After ordering I was informed that both of the options for sides to my burger (a spinach salad or fries) are both not gluten-free. Why were they even listed as options on the specifically gluten-free menu?"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately! No wait time on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. It has a trendy atmosphere with a center bar, so you could just go for drinks or a full meal. The music is a little loud  if you're sitting across the table from someone it's hard to hear. The food came out fast and was delicious."}
{"text":"Ugh hate having to leave a bad review. Went in and ordered a chicken sandwich on the gluten free menu. Specified that I needed it gluten free again during ordering. Food took almost 30 minutes to come out and I was starving. I took a couple of bites and realized the chicken was totally raw. I sent the meal back and 20 minutes out came a chicken breast with no bun and a different side. The server said, \"by the way, we messed up your last one that came out wasn't gluten free.\" ?! So you just let me eat a gluten filled bun? So three hours goes by and I start getting a stomach ache (assuming it's the gluten I was fed) and long behold- it's from the undercooked chicken. I spend 3 1/2 days glued to a toilet, rolling fevers, in and out of a doctors office and please let me add to top this off I had JUST found out I was pregnant (we told our family at Crave, that day!) so needless to say it was horrible timing. I was too stressed to call the restaurant and tell them about this disaster but had previously loved crave and thought this was truly unfortunate. The whole family is a little scared of it now."}
{"text":"I went to check out Downtown Summerlin yesterday with a few of my girlfriends for the first time. After an hour or so of exploring the new shopping area, we wanted to find a place to enjoy drinks and share a few appetizers. 

We looked up happy hour specials nearby and found that we could still make it to Crave's happy hour. 

I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant - very modern and attractive in decor. We sat at a hightop by the bar so we could partake in the happy hour discounted specials. 

For drinks, I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and one of my friends got the Kinky Mojito. I tried her drink; it tasted sour and I couldn't taste the alcohol. She didn't enjoy it either so she ordered wine for her second drink.

We all ordered our separate happy hour menu items and shared a Caprese Pizza. I ordered the Pork Belly Sliders and a Philly Roll. My friends ordered fries, Crispy Chicken Bites, a Futomaki Roll, and the Kogi Tacos.

The food wasn't bad... it was pretty average. The sliders had a unique taste - the pork belly was grilled in a Korean BBQ marinade and topped with a Kimchi relish. They were good, but nothing to rave about. The sushi rolls were rather large but I've had much better. I would not recommend this restaurant if you wanted to splurge on sushi. I enjoyed the fries my friend ordered, they were seasoned perfectly and came with a Peppercorn Avocado Ranch dipping sauce. You can never go wrong with fries!

Our server's name was Joelle and she was very sweet. Attentive to our needs and checked up on us throughout our meal. Nothing negative to say about her.

I would give Crave a 3/5 for the food and a 5/5 for the service. I would recommend Crave only for happy hour drink specials. I think I recall Blue Moons (my favorite beer) being only $4 during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've been to Happy Hour at Crave a few times, but I'm updating my review because this is the first time we've had dinner there.  

We settled in to a comfortable booth, but I had to keep my jacket on the whole time, because it was very cold.  I ordered the house chardonnay.  I never order chardonnay unless I'm forced to.  And it's only recently, with my newfound ability to tolerate it, that it hasn't had me worshiping the porcelain god after just one glass.  It was chardonnay or bust, since I had no intention of paying $11 for a Washington State Riesling that was probably going to be dryer than a... Okay, I'm not going to finish that sentence the way I want to.  The Yelp gods wouldn't like it.  There was a white sangria, but it, too, was $11.  At most other restaurants, sangria is what you order if you're on a strict budget.  Can I afford it?  Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do it.  

So on to the main event.  Hubby ordered Pad Thai, with chicken.  (It's always chicken.  He even clucks in his sleep). Adding that chicken made it nearly 40% more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant, but it was 40% not as good.  The dish was not a large portion and the chicken, what little there was of it, was as dry as that Riesling would have been.    

My dish was the Grilled Salmon salad.  I asked for romaine instead of the spring mix, and it also included spinach, onion, couscous, feta and spiced pecans.  The salmon, which I ordered medium, was a rather small piece, and was cooked medium on half of it, and well done on the other.  When I flipped it over, I saw why:  it was burned on the well-done half.  The romaine was chopped into little pieces.  I know a lot of people like chopped salad, but I'm not one of them.  The pearl couscous was tasteless, the pecans almost non-existent, same as the feta and spinach.  The dressing, which I had on the side, was supposed to be a cranberry vinaigrette, but was a thick and gloppy mixture of unidentifiable ancestry.  No taste of cranberry, or any other fruit, anywhere.  I could have sent my salmon back, but it would have been the same woeful dish, only with (maybe) less incinerated salmon.  There was nothing else I wanted to order, it was late, and I didn't want to wait.

But what really pushed my buttons is that this poor excuse of a salad cried out for bread, both to fill me up and to act as a pusher for those tiny bits of lettuce.  Apparently, that's a dirty word here.  Our waitperson said that many people ask for it and they, too, have conveyed that to the management, but it falls on deaf ears.  I couldn't get it and, knowing that they have it for sandwiches, made me even more pissed off.  I guess the motto here is \"Let them eat cake.\"  I bumped it up one star because at least the service was good.

It's really a shame that this place, with its upscale and beautiful decor, can't produce a decent meal, at least in our case.  And the stinginess of the ingredients, as well as the unwillingness to satisfy a simple request for something that should be provided at the very least with a salad, leads us to say \"¡No más!"}
{"text":"The 702 burger is in the top 5 burgers of Las Vegas.  Plus, Dogfish 90 on tap, perfect combination!"}
{"text":"One of the most annoying dining experiences I've had here in Las Vegas. EVERYTHING has an ingredient my wife can't tolerate in food and they couldn't make ANYTHING that didn't have it. To boot, it was really pricey and the service was very slow. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First the Pros...really the only Pros are the staff, who is warm, friendly and attentive... and the view of the water if you sit on the patio. 

So,  as mentioned previously, we asked to sit on the patio.  The problem here is that they have cranked up their own music outside, which conflicts with the music played by the mall.  It's unpleasant, to say the least. It makes it hard to think, let alone chat.

I ordered the chicken with lemon and garlic sauce for $22.95.  Sadly, it tasted neither like lemon, nor garlic.  It was really bland.  It tasted most like plain grilled chicken sans salt and pepper.  My husband ordered the chicken stir-fry, which was also bland.  It lacked seasoning and the vegetables were over cooked. This was not anything either of us would come back for, let alone \"Crave\". 

We hope they improve the taste of their food so they can live up to their name."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after hearing about it countless times and I have to say I was more impressed with the decor than the food and service...

Definitely interesting ingredients and twists in classic dishes if you're into that sort of thing. The service was beyond slow, the restaurant wasn't too filled, there were more than enough servers and somehow we still ended up being there about 2 hours. Not terrible but not worth a second shot for lunch at least."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious help. First off the girls at the front were quoting waits despite that tons of tables were open all over the restaurant. They informed us that we could sit at the sushi bar with no wait so we sat immediately. Our server was quick with greeting and very friendly so she was absolutely not the issue with this train wreck. So here it goes first off the wine glasses weren't polished so they had water spots all over, balsamic chicken salad was mediocre and full of leaves with huge hard stems, servers seemed to be standing around hanging out and not one moved aside to give me the right away when I walked through, they had an entire section being used to polish silverware out in the dining room, managers seemed to not care about what was going on, oh and there was no seat covers in the bathroom. 
So disappointed, I should've just grabbed a pretzel."}
{"text":"CRAVE - We won a $100.00 Happy Hour Party for up to 10 people. 
We booked the party to celebrate a birthday.   We had outstanding service, the food was great and it just kept coming for over an hour they delivered a huge variety of food samplings. Pizzas,sliders,sushi, 
Pot stickers, lettuce wraps, amazing variety. Jeff and Joe  accommodated our need to be out of the bar area as a member of our party was not yet 21. Hayley our waitress was pleasant, helpful and provided excellent service throughout the evening.  They even allowed us to bring in a birthday cake for our celebration. Their Happy Hour prices are very reasonable. We loved the decor and we will return soon. Thanks CRAVE !"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and usually pretty good experience. Service is hit or miss. Nice ambiance and great menu selection. They have a separate sushi menu which I appreciate. 

3/26/16 I met my friend for a Saturday lunch. Not too busy. We were seated in booths in the bar area and were waited on by Jordan. He was a great server! Very attentive, funny, knowledgeable about the menu, refilled our waters often without being asked. We really liked his personality. 

I really like the menu selection. They also have a special menu (at least they did on 3/26) where they donated a portion of the meal price to a charity.

I was really wanting some seared ahi tuna but I wanted a tuna steak and a side of rice. So I looked at the menu and the closest thing I could find to what I was craving was the sesame seared ahi tuna salad. I asked the waiter to order just the seared ahi on a plate, and a side of jasmine rice. I was rather disappointed in the serving size of the tuna, very very thinly sliced ahi. Ah well.. it *IS* what I requested... I can't get upset about my bad choices, right? I will give the chef credit, it was definitely a very beautiful presentation, and the tuna was super delicious. I just wish there was more than 2 ounces of it! It actually melted in my mouth, it was quality sashimi. 

My friend and I also ordered the hummus appetizer, which was amazing!!!! I love the cucumbers served with the crispy pita bread, something about a really fresh cucumber and hummus that is so refreshing. The hummus was slightly spicy and had jalapeno in it. SO good. 

Everything is reasonably priced, with the tuna only costing $15. Great service and food, and an awesome location in the middle of downtown summerlin mall. Great place to stop before or after a movie, or to take a break from shopping."}
{"text":"Here to try their happy hour. A very beautiful restaurant in the new downtown summerlin. Had the Sushi Tuna Roll, very good. The Lettuce Wraps are individually prepared and they were tasty. We also had the crispy pork dumplings, they were the only disappointment, they were pre made and not very good. Everything else was so unique and presented so nicely. I would recommend this place, very nice."}
{"text":"No. No no no. I am so disappointed!! I don't know what I'm more disappointed with! The service- 15min waiting to be acknowledged after we sat down... Or the fact that my jambalaya tasted like someone poured an entire bottle of tabasco in the sauce!! I love spicy food... But give me a break!! I was expecting Cajun seasonings. The smell of the sauce literally was burning the inside of my nose. 4 bites in and I thought I was gonna be sick. I pushed my food away because the smell of vinegar was too much.

When our server finally decided to take out plates away, he noticed that I barely touched my food. I proceeded to tell him that the smell and taste of Tabasco was just way too much and really gross and make me sick to my stomach. His only response to me was \"maybe you would like to order some desserts to get the taste out of your mouth\" ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!  No apology.. No getting the manager. I tried to wave a manager down, but I was ignored. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. If you value your precious daily calorie intake.. Go to shake shack"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a dear friend's birthday last Thursday at 12:30 PM; restaurant was practically empty.  Service was terribly slow, restaurant had fewer than 20 people in it.  Food finally arrived at 1:30 PM.  Ordered a brownie dessert; that took another 45 minutes.  Manager was summoned, said we should have been told they had to make the Marshmallow topping that goes on the brownie?  Really?  Gave us the dessert for free, but by that time we were over it.  Needless to say we'll be looking for another place to celebrate in the future..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots in the northwest. We chose it for New Years Eve dinner and was not disappointed.  Our waitress, Haylee with the ginger hair offered superb service during our complete dining experience. We enjoyed the edamame appetizer with our blackberry themed cocktails, then great salads before our entree of pasta with lamb meatballs...superb and worth the wait!  We ended the night with chocolate martinis for dessert.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, mostly because of the variety of the menu and we have never had to wait for a table. The food is pretty good but I think overpriced. The service is usually slow and I am always confused about the decor. Not too sure what they are going for with the applebee's style tables/chairs, carpeting, and curtains in all the corners. Feels very dated. I would expect a little bit nicer atmosphere for the cost to dine there. Overall we will probably keep coming back because it's an easy place with lots of choices for everyone."}
{"text":"5 stars! Dakota was very prompt in seating me at a great booth and she was so kind. For once a hostess who actually seemed like she genuinely wanted us there! Our server Jordan was very informative and had excellent recommendations. I had a lunch combination with the crave salad and a half BLT. So good! My friend had the bison burger. We shared the Mexican roll and were absolutely blown away. We will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. I could not believe how slow they were. Took over 10 minutes just to get four glasses of water to the table. We sat outside in the patio area, only three other tables sat and 1 server. Didn't even bother to ask how we were doing, we had to hunt her down to ask for everything.

Only reason they received 2 stars was their food was somewhat decent but the service left such a bad taste that was just wanted to get out of there. Food was average, nothing special, decent enough if your hungry and don't care about service."}
{"text":"The food is so yummy! The wings are insanely good. It's also a super fun environment with a really unique and original menu. The food is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few cool bars/restaurants in downtown Summerlin. They have some drinks and food on happy hour but most of the items are very small. Their signature drinks are really good, I tried the Michelada (which is great if you like spicy items), Raspberry Ginger Gimlet (was super good, very refreshing, somewhat sweet and with a great flavor) and the Angry Dragon (also a very tasty and flavorful drink) if you are not into prepared drinks they also have a large selection of beer. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very inviting. The decor is fresh and modern but somewhat relaxed at the same time. 
We tried the mini chicken apple sauce flat bread which was good, but nothing that I would be craving. The crispy chicken bites were just ok, but again the size portions were small. We ordered a few rolls and they were no big deal, I'm sure I can get the same quality at Smiths. Overall a good place for drinks, but there are probably better options out there."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and very warm. Great food. I had some artichoke dip with flat bread. Then I had 9th Roll sushi roll...it had tempura shrimp with avocado and raw salmon on top and rolled in rice and cucumber. Then went out of their way to serve my friend a bday cake and ice cream for her birthday."}
{"text":"Came to Crave at 1:30pm on Sunday 2/19 only to wait for 15 minutes before a random waiter (not our waiter) greeted us/brought us waters and told us our waiter would be with us shortly. So we waited another 10 mins and still nobody came. We finished our waters and left. 

Pretty ridiculous as the place was not busy to be ignored for any timeframe like that. I tried to call to speak with a manager after we left only to be told they were to busy to speak with me.  

I couldn't recommended this place or not for their food because I wasn't able to try it but the service obviously sucks."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Crave at lunch several times and thought the food was good. Went there tonight and I have to say... the California roll was DeeeLicious!  I also got the Chicken Avocado rolls and some regular French fries. French fries were not great. They seem to have a problem with their salt shakers working, and they come with no flavor or seasoning. Just a deep fried chunk of potato. Speaking of deep fried... they put hardly any chicken in the chicken avocado rolls so they pretty much tasted like rolls of deep fried guacamole.  

The servers never seem to have enough time. You are lucky to see them once every ten minutes so catch them while you can if you need something for your meal, or you are ready to pay. 

I think I will stick with lunch from now on. And stay away from the fried guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Went on a Sat night for happy hour around 5pm-  was told on the phone and at the front door they had happy hour 3-6pm. Then when I ask for HH specials, I'm told they don't have HH Sat until 9pm. Should've walked away then. Was on a work budget of $30 for dinner, which gets you nowhere on normal pricing in Vegas. The bartender was nice and poured my first drink strong- had 2 well rum and diets $7 each. Ordered a spicy tuna roll- nothing special for $9. Not worth it for 6 pieces. Has decent bar to watch games at but wouldn't go again during normal dining hours."}
{"text":"After receiving a free appetiser offer from POSARE' Salon, I stopped by. Listen, I'm an Elite Yelper so I always check with Yelp even with a free offer. And although I don't usually patron a 3 star business because I truly think the system works, I thought what a creative way for \"Crave\" to promote their business and hopefully increase their star power. Not to mention, I needed a drink! Lol
So, walking in... very cool vibe. I decided to sit at the bar and watch the action. I immediately decided, I liked this place. The staff were all very friendly... a guy walking around spinning pizza a dough... fun! My free Firecracker Shrimp appetiser was enough for 3 people as a starter and it was very good. Ordered an entree to go for a late night dinner... enough for 2 or 3 meals and really is delicious... even reheated. Only negative... I'm a big craft beer drinker and sadly, their draft system was down but they did have a few bottled choices and they were very cold so brownie points for that. 
Would I go back without the coupon... YES! Would I recommend \"Crave\"... YES! No explanation for the 3 star rating but love that they have stepped up and it must be working."}
{"text":"Eh. I had high expectations for this place and was really excited because it's just down the street from my house. Everything we ordered was...just OK. We tried if you appies and a few entrées and everything was pretty mediocre. Everything we had was great in concept...but the execution just wasn't there. The sushi dish (yellowtail carpaccio I think?) was missing something. The sliders too - sounded really good and all the ingredients should have worked...but they just didn't stand out. 

The prices were on par for Downtown Summerlin, not cheap, but not strip prices either. 

I'll go back and try it again, if only for the location and the ambience. It has a good atmosphere and I'd go back to check out the date night menu. 

I think with a little tweaking and attention to detail, this place could be a lot better."}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS RESTAURANT NO STARS I WOULD... NOT SO MUCH FOR THE FOOD BUT FOR THE MANAGEMENT IN PARTICULAR KEVIN KELLEY THE GENERAL MANAGER, WHO IS A VERY NASTY, ARROGANT PERSON.  We were invited for Customer Appreciation Day on Thursday and everyone was lined up ready to bring the little bites they put out to their table and Kevin chose to announce only 2 items were allowed????  You invite people to a appreciation day and then put a limit on what they can bring to the table??? This doesn't make sense, people were taking 4 plates of sushi, hamburgers, pizza and rightfully so as it was supposed to be customer appreciation day.... However Kevin must have wanted to economize so he was going to limit the food you were allowed to take. On the invite it says nothing about their being limit on the food.  I didn't find the sushi to be too great as the seaweed was very difficult to chew... The burger was OK and of course with the limit on everything who knows what else I would have like to taste if he didn't stand their like a prison guard watching the food and what you put on your plate..... This restaurant has had problems in the past so they brought in Kevin Kelley the new GM who is supposed to turn Crave around and bring in business.... well if he continues with the attitude he had, the fake smile and the annoyance in his voice and patrolling every table to see what you have taken from the FREE appreciation items I don't think he is going to bring in many customers.  You have to serve quality food and have a great staff and your management and especially the GM should bend over backward to make their customers feel comfortable, welcome and wanted,  Not so with Kevin, he's find when you are spending money in the restaurant, but as soon as they are giving away free food he become an entirely different person..... Nope, not my kind of restaurant, I like to feel appreciated, not by what I spend but because I patronize the restaurant.... Not so here.... if the review isn't good, you are not welcome.......ALSO AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PRICES OF THE ENTREES ARE MUCH TOO HIGH FOR WHAT IS IN THE DISH.  VERY SMALL PORTIONS BUT HIGHER PRICED THAT THE SURROUNDING RESTAURANTS...  maybe that is why they are always empty, people may go in once or twice but when you see what you get for the price you are paying you don't return."}
{"text":"The menu was very appealing. The ambiance was perfect. Our waitress made the experience very pleasurable. ..I ordered the ribeye which was cooked to perfection along with asparagus, very nicely paired."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience! I sat at bar, bartender was very friendly and really helpful with menu. In fact she practically ordered for me. She also enrolled me in loyalty program and they have been sending me lots of coupons. I will return for the vast menu and great ambiance. Try the Lemon chicken wings!! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely redeemed itself since it first opened. Sean, was an amazing chef. Michael was a great server. They took care of us and me and my best friend had a great night here!"}
{"text":"I've been to CRAVE three times now (one dinner, one lunch, one happy hour), and I've enjoyed the food each time. I can tell that it's been freshly prepared utilizing high quality ingredients. To me, that's a huge plus for any restaurant.

My experience with the service has been positive all 3 times. Note that the lunch and, obviously, happy hour were both in the bar.

While I haven't tried their sushi yet, I did enjoy their mahi mahi dinner. The fish was fresh and the preparation tasty and unique.

I would agree that the menu is a bit overpriced, but I'm willing to pay for quality.

CRAVE is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff. I never saw the bottom of my glass. Our server was very attentive and nice. We order the Sushi Boat. The food was good. Presentation was nice. Sushi was great. I gave them three star because of the desert. We had the triple chocolate cake. Although it tasted alright it was dry and stale. I would still come back on this place and suggest it to some of my friends who would like to try it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: What a benefit to Crave that they are one of the only restaurants open during the opening of DTS. Crave feels like it's menu of Sushi/Burgers... Identity confused. The sushi smell will likely knock you over when you walk in the door.The hostess could use some classes on cordiality, and possibly look at you when speaking, let alone a smile. My family and I waited for 30min, to be set at the bar when there were open booths available, not the most comfortable. The hiring manager likes blondes with tattoos, that's clearly evident by the very attractive tattooed waitresses.

Food: I was surprised that I had to pay for the bread basket (usually complimentary), but ok. The burger, well it had a patty. Now the flatbread apple sausage was totally worth all the BS that I had to deal with. Also, the crab cake (with salad) was pretty darn good. For desert, the smores brownie... Or the snores browie... 


Not really for the fam, Ironic since Summerlin (the target demo) is mostly families. I hope this place gets it together before any competition opens up."}
{"text":"Geesh people give them a minute! I saw amount of stars and almost didn't go but if you read them everyone is complaining about the girls at the front. My gosh they've been there like a week let them settle in. 

The food here is really amazing. The sushi roll I had was amazing I can't wait to go back and try literally everything on the menu. \"I\" actually messed up and ordered my sushi wrong and they fixed it even though it was my fault. (Mexican roll...YUM!)

Our waiter was super friendly and prompt. I hope people read reviews because the stars are a bad reflection of the food. I'm super snobby when it come to food and this place was GREAT!

Check it out yourself and leave a review if you love it. Yelpers shouldn't leave reviews on service of a brand new restaurant at least give them 30 days come on people!"}
{"text":"Loved it! 

Beautiful space, excellent service and great food. The chicken strips appetizer was spicy and delicious. For my entree I had the jicama and grapefruit salad. It was fantastic. Impressive wine list and I had a cocktail I wasn't overly impressed with but it was pretty good too."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. We ordered a Duck Confit Flatbread, which had jam spread, greens, cheese. The Scallops were nicely seasoned and browned, over a bed of butternut squash rissotto. The scallop poppers were from the sushi menu, its a ball of rice, wrapped in raw salmon, and topped with scallop chunks in the middle. 

They have happy hour during the week only. We ordered a White Sangria and a Sparkling Cranberry. They were both very delicious but i felt disappointed because i think they drink sizes were too small. 

There is indoor and outdoor seating, the outdoor seating has both tables and lounge chairs and couches.

I felt that our server was not very knowledgeable. She would admit she hasn't tasted all the menu items, and then she would recommend drinks, we'd how that drink tasted and then she'd say again she's never tried it."}
{"text":"For sure one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. Hostess was awesome, sweet and welcoming and our server Isaiah was on his game. I had the chicken, Brie, and apple sammy that was   pretty damn yum. Best part they brought us out goodies for our anniversary!"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour with a couple friends today. Food was good. Especially liked the Parmesan truffle fries and pork dumplings. The Aloha roll, on the regular menu, was delicious also! Our favorite drink was the Kinky Mojito!!!! 

Of special note...our server ended up being one of the bartenders named Michael. He was very courteous and provided professional service. In addition, he went above and beyond the call of duty...my friend left her glasses on the table when we left, we had told him we were going for gelato (why we didn't order dessert there). He walked all the way to the gelato place just to bring her glasses! Michael deserves recognition for his extra effort in exceptional customer service! Thanks for taking such good care of us!"}
{"text":"Sorry , but when we spend $100 on a lunch for 4 people , I get super offended when I'm charged .75cents for an iced tea refill.   I don't appreciate being nickel & dimed in an already overpriced restaurant and we won't be back."}
{"text":"First of all great environment inside and out. I ordered a Bento box sushi whatever their premium box was called. The sushi roll that came with it was crap. I asked the waiter if I got the right role since he recommended it. As it turned out, he never had it. Just recommending things on the menu that he has no clue about. Learn the f**kn menu and what's on the menu. Could've done better with a hamburger or something else that looks OK on their menu. Definitely stay away from sushi at this place. I also ordered the wings which were gigantic, but in the end average. I would probably give it a second chance if someone wanted to go there however I wouldn't go there myself again."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all!!!! Service is awful!!!! Went here today sit at the bar... I was starving and ordered right away, menu was just handed to me and have no idea how the portions  are, the salmon salad was decent and I had some crab cakes for appetizer which came out together with my salad... The bartender didn't even ask how my food was, the guy next to me ask me \"how was the crab cakes\" bartender was In front of me when I response \"it's really salty\" and he didn't say a word!  Bad bad service...."}
{"text":"We stopped in on the opening weekend. It was predictably packed, but we were seated promptly for our reservation. We were incredibly fortunate to have Emily as our server. It was obvious she was very busy, but she never seemed rushed or flustered. She even managed to find the time to chat us up about my iPhone. 

I ordered a Paloma. Excellent. I had the bison burger which was the best burger that I've had. Ever. The only real drawbacks were the uncomfortable bistro-style stools and that it was ridiculously loud to the point that it was hard to carry a conversation. Other than that, a pretty good experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service was amazing!  Our Waiter was Jake.  Best service I have had in a long time!  Nicole the Hostess is a sweetheart!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We walked in and asked for outside seating, got it right away.

We ordered drinks and our food after about ten minutes, I feel like that is a normal wait time. Our waitress was running around I could overhear other tables being quite needy (as in can you move my umbrella I wanted to sit outside but not deal with the sun or the heat or the birds ha) 

I asked for a recommendation on which fish dish was better in her opinion and she recommended the salmon but warned me about the mustard flavor. Honestly it was delicious so kudos. 

I think people need to give the place a chance it's just opened give it awhile to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like the place -- but the overall experience disappointed really ..  My martini \"Crave Martini\" wasn't even near full .. at $10.25 each they could at least find a way to fill the not really large glass.  it was a tasty combination tho so yes, ordered another which came slightly more full.
Husbands pinot noir wine pour was pretty scrimpy - kind of gave me the impression they are 'quietly' trying to squeeze every possible dollar out of every customer - not a good impression.
Food - was ok - nothing to exclaim \"cant wait to go back for ___\" Had wedge salads which arrived 20 mins after ordering .. the place was not very busy so it couldn't be due to that.  Surfer roll (real crab was the reason we ordered it) arrived on a rather long rectangular plate, and sat dwarfed on it - it was an 8 piece itty bitty teeny tiny roll - again for $10.95 I thought it would at least be something good to share so we could taste a few menu items.  We opted for a Lobster/Shrimp flatbread - this arrived on a long wooden platter - I think they spent too much on their dinnerware and serveware for what they provide food-wise.  It reminded me of matzoh - dry at that - the somehow managed to miss applying the pesto to most of the flatbread - it was 'dotted' with pieces of bay shrimp and cut up langostino - which isn't lobster and for which chain restaurants Rubios and Red Lobster have been sued for using when saying Lobster.  if you are not a foodie, or really pay much attention, it is ok, but ...
Service was ok - Justin did his best so he was rewarded tip-wise but the overall experience left me wondering how long this place will last.  We may or may not be back."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the food and by the service! We came in with a group of six and our waiter, Nicholas, was amazing! He knew the food inside and out. He also never let us have to ask for anything, he was two steps ahead the whole time!
The food was really good! Everyone got something different and everyone cleaned their plate! The prices were fantastic as well! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been there a several times. It is always pretty good. 
Service was a little slow, but really no complaints.

I got the scallops, they are really good.

***I decided to Edit my review. My family and I keep going back to Crave and it seems to be getting better. My 11 year old requests going there.

Costco sells gift cards to Crave. For $80 you can purchase a $100 gift card. Getting a 20% discount before you even walk in the door. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy lunch or dinner. We both enjoyed the Chicken Pasta Rosa. I would like to recognize our server Cassie who provided outstanding service. Five Stars to you Cassie. I highly recommend you try The Crave for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Tuesday with 5 people and it was a great experience.  The waitress was fantastic; refills flowed and all our needs were addressed.  We had several apps: nachos, short rib tacos, scallops, California roll, and tuna tataki.  All were very tasty and fresh, although the portion size was a bit small on all but the nachos.  Main courses included 2 of the steak dishes (outstanding) and mac & cheese bowls (very good).  The only complaint is that the prices are a bit high for an eatery of this caliber, but if you don't mind that, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"First timer.  I came in with my friend today during happy hour.  We always walk by here but never stopped in.  I'm happy we did.  We sat at the bar.  Cassy was the bartender.  She was wonderful and attentive.  Very friendly and gave us great suggestion on drinks and food.  We weren't so hungry, we ordered: truffle parmesan fries, tuna roll, and margherita flatbread.  Delicious three appetizers, I really liked the margherita flatbread best!  We got some drinks too, glass of chardonnay and mojito.  Both drinks were great."}
{"text":"We came here because Crave sponsors O'Roarke Elementary's Pep Squad.  We had no real expectations and were pleasantly surprised by delicious food, great service and a great location.  The Honey Sriracha wings were delicious, sushi is fresh and reasonably priced.  Good kids menu selections (with healthy choices!) Overall great experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Our first trip was a 3 star, food was OK. We were in area and decided to stop in again after seeing sign showing new menu items. The sign brought us in but we did not try the great looking shrimp dish in the picture!
The food was much better this time around. Pork dumplings were very good. Chips and guacamole was very good, and they actually give you enough for two. I shared a burger with my husband and we both enjoyed it. Try the truffle fries!
The interior is very nice and our service was good. 
We were also able to catch the end of the Broncos game when Manning came in to rescue them over the Chargers. Nice bonus."}
{"text":"It's okay.  I've tried a few different menu items and they were all good.  The s'more brownie desert is delicious!  The menu selection is nice, but very little interests me.  Lots of sushi selections; the raw selections are not of interest to me.  I've been here a few times and go only when my friends want to eat there.  Did I mention the s'more brownie is delicious!"}
{"text":"Update:
Was communicated to by Crave personnel regarding their seriously horrific service.  Gave them a final try today, and I must say- even them taking care of basically the bill still will not make me go back again.
My rating of 1 star stands, while it was better- this establishment is extremely over priced, and service still just is not to the level that this establishment makes itself look like it should be.  For being high priced and in DTS- it should have a 4-5 star rating,  but management and staff have made this place just terrible and the lack of pride in service has now begun to come through in their food quality.  

So as of now- this place literally can't pay me to come and eat here.




Don't know where my first review went-  posted it because we had absolutely atrocious service and ended up leaving before ordering because the staff was so rude.

My wife gave them another try with her friend and that was ok- so I have them a try and it was great,

But went in today for my wife's birthday.............
After sitting waiting for nearly 10 minutes for any of the wait staff to even acknowledge our presence,,,,,even though they walked by several times and even gave drink orders to the table LITERALLY RIHT NEXT TO US-, we finally left.  Very nice of the lady whom looked like a manager that had looked at us several times and not bothered to help us though as we got up to leave come running over and talk to us finally-

Simply put,  this place can jog"}
{"text":"When we arrived there was no one at the hostess stand.  Once we we're finally seated it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table.  We decided to order off the happy hour menu.  The food was just okay.  Nothing that would make us want to come back though.  Our waitress China was bubbly and provided fantastic customer service and we did enjoy the patio dining."}
{"text":"De-li-cious. To have ate here 3 times and the food has been fantastic. Esp the chicken sausage Flatbread. They're also dog friendly on their patio and provide us a bowl of water. The HH is at the bar or patio and they have an evening HH as well as a reverse one"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!  And not fair to the two previous times we have been there.   Was  there for weekday lunch and Mon eve sushi.  Was fab!   They told us about brunch and have been so excited to go.   Omg.   Horrible.   Got there and one other group of 4 at the bar.   Not even an acknowledged.   We continued to order brunch.    Mgr -Tory - walked by us a dozen times without saying a word.  Left half of a flat bread.  Was just ok.  Never asked if anything was wrong.  Had to ask bartender  Chelsea for water, setup, salt n pepper in addition to many refills. Also was a problem w/amt paid. After we paid and expressed dissatisfaction, then Mgr stopped by.  Equally horrible as sever.  We are in the hospitality/service industry.    This was absolutely horrible.  If they were working for my establishment, they would be gone.  Locals are here to stay.  Not at this place.  Go upstairs to public house.  They treat you way better.!!!   Remember.   Customer service oriented is the key...."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible its our first time here and the server is like rushing us and he said we need to to get pur order in at 10:00 and I was like I cant decide coz the menu looks fade away, I cant even read the ingredients esp on the sushi side. While I was looking at the menu trying to decide what to get he was just standing there like the fuck I need space smh.. Then its 10:02 he came and ask us again but thought the order needed to be at 10 smh so we just left."}
{"text":"Just average.  Great sushi specials if you like that sort of thing."}
{"text":"There aren't many food options at the Summerlin mall just yet. On a recent trip Dyanna L, her man Brent S. and I all decided to check out Crave. I'd also seen lots of fellow Yelpers check in here and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. 

Upon walking in we were greeted by at least 4 hostesses. We were quickly walked around what felt like the whole restaurant to our seats. The hostess pulled out our chairs (fancy) and handed us menus. Our glasses were filled with ice cold water. They do have a vast menu and they even have a full sushi bar. The prices are high so be prepared. Since we had intentions of eating someplace else later I was checking out the appetizers, but could not resist their huge sushi menu. Since I was watching my budget I just went with the Spicy Salmon Roll ($8). Dyanna got another specialty sushi roll and a martini and Brent got edamame, soup and some jumbo shrimp. Everything was just ok. Nothing that special and definitely not worth the price. 

Fancy atmosphere and only meh food doesn't mean your can charge outrageous prices. With Wolfgang right around the corner we might as well have gone there and had amazing food or I guess we just should have stuck to Wetzels Pretzels. Save your money and hit up another restaurant in this ever growing mall."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to try Crave due to the reviews on Yelp. However, I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the aloha roll and the King Kong. Both were delicious and I've tried a lot of sushi places in Vegas. The aloha roll was spicy but really well prepared. My boyfriend ordered the Mac and cheese. He said he really enjoyed it but was expecting it to be spicier with the addition of the sauce. We had pineapple mojitos which were also very good! I would definitely come back. They have a really big menu with a variety of choices."}
{"text":"I give the extra star for friendliness of staff.  That being said, they seemed understaffed when we dined there.  understandable considering how new it still is.  The food was tasty and somewhat prompt with above average execution.  The quality that seemed to be missing from everything overall was conception.  It comes off as if they are trying to execute multiple concepts at once, like a casual mid to upscale sushi bar/yardhouse that is part intimate - part sports bar-ish.  This creates a confusing vibe as it is not pulled together in its paradoxical ways, and IMHO they do not capitalize on such a mish mash of concepts with their menu items.  The other reason I give them four stars, is because despite these and more shortcomings, it is clear that they are putting time and effort into making it all work in a genuine way.  Whether or not they continue to develop it into a more refined version of itself, I applaud the effort they are clearly putting into it."}
{"text":"I went to crave with my family yesterday for the first time. And let me tell you I was blown away. The employees were so nice, and our server was very good at his job. He knew every question we asked him, my father had a handful of questions about the beers, and the server knew just what to say, as he was very helpful. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, the restaurant was themed so beautifully. I ordered the firecracker shrimp, I thought it would be too spicy, but it was just right. They had one of my favorite sodas, PIBB, I was surprised they had it, not a lot places do. The prices were reasonable for the food. I had a great time visiting Crave, I got to enjoy a really good lunch. I also recognized one of the female African American servers working there from high school, she was a senior when I was a freshman. She was very nice to me and seemed to have remembered who I was. Crave is the ideal place to eat if you want to go out with friends or family, enjoy a nice casual lunch or dinner at a nicer restaurant, compared to a quick sit down place."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour, when there are certain appetizers for half off. Buffalo wings were among as well as crispy chicken sliders. They are also in the process of revamping their menu. I also got this cheesecake/ came. It was very light and had a lemon like flavor. I forgot what it was called, here is a picture below."}
{"text":"Crave! Such. A beautiful restaurant indeed. The service was fantastic except for the rude hostess. The food was incredible, I had a margherita flatbread which was phenomenal and ordered the turkey burger! It was absolutely delicious except for the fact when I picked it up a pool of oil/grease fell all over my hand in large amounts.... I couldn't eat the bun cause there was literally too much compared to the patty, and it was soggy!! but it was amazing! For fries, I recommend the gluten free and not the normal ones... Mine were stale and dry:("}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 4 - Really nice, really clean. Probably looks more upscale than it probably should.

SERVICE: 4 - Pretty awesome service. Our server was just really cool and helpful. He was always coming to check on us and see if we wanted anything more before happy hour ended. 

FOOD: 3 - It was okay. It wasn't the best, but one dish is worth mentioning: Sriracha Wings. I thought they were pretty good. A bit too pricey for happy hour, but pretty good. I also selected the Caprese Chicken Sandwich, which was pretty weird, by the way--otherwise okay tasting. 

Also, the happy hour drink section just wasn't worth it. My friend ordered one drink and I had to finish it because she didn't like it. All I have to say about it is that..that drink was not worthy. 

I see that they have sushi, but I think I'll pass. I have to give this place an overall 2 because of the menu. Honestly, Crave has potential, it could be a good American restaurant. But, their menu is so out there and weird that people are just not craving Crave."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday evening. It was a while before we got noticed, greeted,and seated. The restaurant was nearly empty but we still needed to wait for a specific table in a specific section to be cleaned. (the logistics) hostess never smiled at all...
Pros:
1- restaurant is absolutely gorgeous
2- steak was very tender. Portions are sufficient 
3- waitress was very nice and courteous
4- large selection and menu variety

Cons:
1- the long time it took to get noticed and greeted
2- there were discrepancies in pricing between the menu posted outside and the menu delivered to the tables
3- unfriendly hostess

You guys have so much potential to be the best restaurant in your area. I think the points you missed are stupid and fixable. We like you and we will try to come once more before making up our mind."}
{"text":"I went to a wine dinner last night with 4 others.  The food and wine were excellent but the service was outstanding.  Our servers were fabulous.  Attentive and responsive.  Our whole table was impressed with the service.  We look forward to attending the next wine dinner."}
{"text":"I'm back and this time disappointed. I'm having dinner and my sea bass was bland, salmon sushi roll was blah, my wife's pesto chicken was undercooked, my bro's filet mignon was supposed to be medium rare but turned out well(overcooked), which couldve been a very bad health concern, and they forgot my kids apple juice. The place was about a 3/4 empty of people, so for the food to be cooked like that means the staff was full of unprofessional undereducated rookies! Too bad, because this is a total opposite from first experience as you can read in my review. My wife didn't even have anymore time to eat the dish they replaced and by then you can't give back the missed experience of eating w/the rest of your party!"}
{"text":"Workers were so polite and helpful. My food and my friend's food came out really fast despite the place being busy. Definitely going back here soon~"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Liked the Mexican roll. The décor and environment was somewhat strange, felt very institutional."}
{"text":"This place just can't get their stuff together. I work in the mall and every time I give this place a shot I end up regretting it. Last time about 3 months ago the service was horrible and the food was mediocre at best. Today I ordered the couscous protein bowl. I'm allergic to onions and the description did not state that onions were included in the dish. Aside from peanuts - onions is one of the most allergic food types in the American diet. You would think that the menu would mention it ? The bowl had 5 little strips of chicken. Two of them were 90 percent fat. Just another poor experience at place that I will no longer visit, even with all the free food coupons they give away this place is just no good. Period"}
{"text":"A new favorite!!

This was an impromptu dinner and we were not disappointed! Our server Maggie was so helpful, down to earth, & made us smile every time she stopped by our table. 

The food was AMAZING. We even got to enjoy the outdoor seating since the weather was great. 

Also, Maggie mentioned how new creative dishes are always being added to the menu. Who doesn't like new things, right?

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Inside is nice, very modern. Our waiter was very nice and attentive... The lettuce wraps were gross. Every bite I was getting pieces of chicken grizzle.. I ordered the margarita flatbread.. There were chunks of rock salt on it that made it inedible, how do you screw up a margarita flatbread? My bf ordered a burger the meat was delicious but the bun was burnt to shit.. He had to rip half of the bun off... It was fast food quality at a high end restaurant price.. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We arrived Sunday around 5 PM, and waited in the front for a good ten minutes prior to anyone acknowledging that we were there. The restaurant was not very busy so we were surprised that we had to wait so long to be seated. 

Happy hour is available all day Sundays, and found that CRAVE had quite a few items offered between $3 and $6. We ordered 3 dishes, the pesto chicken flatbread, the Korean nuggets, and the bacon cheddar tater tots.

The Korean nuggets had a good flavor, however the breading was falling apart and quite mushy. It definitely needed to be cooked to a crispier finish. 

The bacon cheddar tots are not what you may expect. I was thinking it would be a crispy tot with bacon and cheddar melted on top, however, the bacon and cheddar were actually inside the tots. The tots had mashed potato consistency on the inside. The flavor was good, however it was served on such a large plate, that it looked rather unappealing. 

In  contrast, the flatbread was larger than the plate it was served on. It had an okay flavor, however it is not something I would actually ever CRAVE. 

Overall, the happy hour food and drinks are cheap, but so is the quality. I would say you get what you pay for, however, I still think I overpaid."}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait sometimes for the food to come to the table can be really long. Don't come here if you need to make it to a movie or don't have time to wait. Otherwise the food and drinks are good and they offer lots of nice deals. Happy hours is nice. I love their sushi menu!"}
{"text":"Don't bother....seriously. Decided to go to \"crave\" on a Sunday night for a quick dinner with my fiancé. Did I say quick? Because it wasn't, service is extremely slow and not professional. But that's only the beginning, we first ordered crab artichoke dip and it tasted old. For entree I had a ribeye steak medium rare, came out medium with Luke warm mashed potatoes and barley edible Brussels sprouts. The \"lobster linguine\" is a joke, and tasted like death. Overall don't bother going."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Monday for lunch.  We sat in the bar and the service was excellent.  The food was fine.  I ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread and the crave side salad.  It was good but didn't blow my mind.  I would go back again and order something else.  My friend ordered the chipotle salad and that looked amazing.  Our server was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This place is sort of a hit or miss...  my 10 year old daughter and I went together.  It was not particularly a kid friendly restaurant. Upper scale atmosphere with overpriced, undersized meals... my daughter had an $18  (very SMALL portion) of fried rice with chicken.  It was yummy but the flavor (including kimchi) was a bit mature for kids..we weren't given a kids menu so I don't know if one was even available.   I ordered the cioppino.  $27 for what seemed like a few tablespoons of broth, 2 nice sized shrimp, 4 over- cooked mussels and a few tiny scallops.  I'm quite aware that I live in the land of buffets and oversized portions but this was a bit extreme in the opposite direction.  I sent back the cioppino and ordered the bison burger.  Yes it was filling and delicious, but again...$$$ plus extra for the fries. Drinks ...also pricy.  All in all not a great experience for me and my girl.   Perhaps better for a romantic date if you are not concerned with price."}
{"text":"The sea bass plate was overpriced and not worth it, the burger was OK."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Crave. We were greeted and seated promptly, hostess was very friendly. We were early for our reservation but they were able to work with us and provide us a seat. We came the day before Valentines day for a Prix Fix dinner for two. Price was 89.00 before taxes and drinks. Our waiter Jake came right away and gave us water and requested a drink order. We had not seen beverage list and asked him to return. He came back soon after took drink order.( was very impressed with his service considering how busy he was). I want very hard to describe Crave. Its not upscale, or bistro. Has a bar in front open restaurant with open kitchen. It was loud and hard to talk over the din at times. They were quite busy and despite that they did have great service. The Prix Fix Menu had choice 4 items for starter and 4 items for entree and the desert was a duo that came together. Starters were for us Bronzed Scallops and Coffee and Pepper Crusted Petite Tender in Chocolate Port Sauce. The Scallops were perfectly cooked however had a fishy smell that I am not used to with Scallops. They did taste good and were rightly cooked. The Petite Tenders were cooked mid rare and the Chocolate Port sauce was very interesting. When added with the Coffee pepper rub on the meat it gave it a sweet mocha taste. Not bad just different.
Entree....Salmon and shrimp Duo and New York strip. Jake did not ask how I wanted my steak cooked. When I told him Mid Rare he stated \"is there any other way\". So be warned if you want a more cooked piece of meat (and why would you) you must ask. Mid rare is their way. (Yay). Steak was actually bigger than I expected for a Prix Fix dinner. Had great flavor, the red wine reduction was quite nice also. Garlic mashed and Asparagus. Asparagus was nicely cooked on the grill and properly flavored. Josie had The Salmon and Shrimp. Both cooked perfectly. The shrimp had a crispy skin that added perfectly to each bite. There was a carrot Ginger puree' under the Salmon. The flavor of the puree' is hard to describe. Almost like a pumpkin spice but not as bitter. I kept wanting to eat off of Josie's plate. 
Dessert....Duo of Chocolate cake and a Passion Fruit Creme Brulee. The cake was okay, the Brule was grainy and flavor was more Lemon than passion fruit. 
All in all it was a good meal and experience. Service was excellent and food was quite filling. Again very impressed with the portion size for Prix Fix meal. We will return again. If you are shopping or going to a movie in Downtown Summerlin it's a good eating spot."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice, the service was excellent, but the food I'm sad to say was disappointing. My girlfriend and I ordered the lettuce wraps which were the best of everything although the meat was tough and surprisingly hard to chew. We ordered a burger which was lacking flavor on every level, she ordered scallops she wasn't impressed with, and then we shared S'more brownies which I was most excited about, but the brownie was dry and crumbly, the graham crackers made the dryness worse, and the ice cream flavor didn't help matters. If the place wasn't as pricey as it is, it would be easy to say we got what we paid for. But it's been a while since I've been to a place where each dish that came out was more disappointing than the last. Definitely a bummer."}
{"text":"We have had two great experiences at Crave.  The service is excellent and especially our last time there with our server Cassandra.  She was very engaged and quick to help us with any issue.  We had the filet and the chicken stir fry and there was quite a bit of chicken in the dish.  Excellent.  It might be our favorite of the new Downtown Summerlin restaurants."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful Sunday we were so happy to sit on the patio have a couple of drinks and eat some food.  We waited 10 min for water 20 min for our drinks,  when I picked up my beer I looked at my hand and I had blood on my fingers I first checked myself to make sure I wasn't bleeding then when I realized it wasn't my blood I was immediately very disturbed the lady said she would speak to get manager who never came out. Finally I asked to speak to the manager who said none of her staff were bleeding. It was a horrible customer service experience I would definitely recommend for your health and well being don't eat at this restaurant. If this is how they treat this situation what is happening behind the scenes."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the Downtown Summerlin mall all the time with out dogs but this time we went out on a date night. We wanted to try something different and settled on Crave. The restaurant was a little busy but there was no wait for at table outside, which was nice because the weather was beautiful. We looked at the menu, which seemed to be a bit all over the place but we eventually settled on a few different items. My wife had a ginger martini, which was really good and I had a boring iced tea, which I actually thought was pretty good for just plain iced tea.

My wife ordered a Calimari appetizer and a seared tuna salad of some sort. I started off with a spicy tuna roll and then a Traditional Poke Bowl. 

While our server was very friendly, she was also absent a lot and things took a very long time to come out. We were thirsty so we downed our drinks fast and had to ask for refills constantly. One time someone brought me an iced tea with no ice in it. The server caught it and got me a replacement. Again, she was VERY nice, but considering how many staff members were running around, I was a bit surprised how un-attentive everyone was. After a while, our calamari and tuna roll came out.  The Calamari was breaded nicely and was tasty. The roll though, was so small I almost needed a microscope just to find it on the plate. While it did taste good and the tuna had some good heat to it, I was a bit shocked at how minuscule the portion was. It was as if someone cut a tootsie roll into six pieces. 

After another 15 minutes, our other dishes came out...the salad and the poke bowl. It seemed as though my wife's order was pretty good all around but mine, not so much. Her salad looked OK and she seemed generally \"meh\" about it but my poke bowl, coming in at a 15 dollar price tag, was laughable. There was maybe 2 tablespoons of sushi plopped on top of some salad greens. The tuna was cut so small I almost had to eat this with a spoon. I've never seen a poke bowl served this poorly. I eat at poke bowl places all the time where, for 1/2 the price, you get 3X the portion. 

We ate, and then waited around another 10 minutes after for our check, which we had to ask for. While dessert would have probably been an option, we didn't want to wait until the end of the season for it to arrive so we figured we'd have that elsewhere in the mall. All in all, an $85 dinner and when we left, we were still hungry. I'm embarrassed to admit this but for the price, we could have gone to Olive Garden and had a much nicer dinner for less money, and that is pretty sad. Our consensus is that we would never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about going here after seeing all the bad reviews, but hubby and I got a coupon in the mail for a free entree and figured we'd check it out. So glad we did! The staff were friendly, the food was delicious, and the chef even subbed out mashed potatoes for a risotto that sounded amazing at no charge. I had salmon and hubby had jambalaya. Could not be happier with our meals!  

Service was great until the place got busy, and then slowed down quite a bit as other people stated. So yes, do not go there if it's busy and you are in a hurry. The staff is great, just overwhelmed when tables fill up. Be patient. Order another glass of wine. You'll be fine."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for the first time, on Saturday night, 2/11. The hostess was friendly & our waiter was helpful & knowledgeable. The food & wine were very good! We ordered sushi rolls & cucumber salad. I usually find that sushi is too big for one bite, but these were just right & they even had rolls I'd never had before. So yummy & nice presentation!"}
{"text":"Really sad about writing this review because I was excited to try this place out. The food was not flavorful at all. We ordered different sushi rolls, the mac and cheese and steak. The steak was so bland. It was like they just threw it on the grill and plated it. The only good sushi roll was the dynamite roll. The service was horrible. They did not check on us or bother to give us one of our missing sushi rolls. All in all, I would rather drive to Chinatown to eat sushi. If you're a big sushi fan, don't come here. You will be disappointed. It's over priced for low quality."}
{"text":"Ugh. This review is long overdue. I purchased a Livingsocial voucher for Crave. The deal was $58 for a three course dinner for two that included an appetizer, entree, and a dessert from a select menu. My husband and I came to Crave to celebrate our 10-year anniversary together. 

CRAVE STARTER SALAD ($7.95): The ingredients sounded exciting but the salad tasted pretty average. Nothing special here. 3/5
POBLANO CAESAR SALAD ($7.95): The polenta croutons were an interesting touch and the mister approved of the salad. 3.5/5

GRILLED MAHI MAHI ($26.95): He thought it was alright but complained that the shrimp was really rubbery. 3/5
LOBSTER LINGUINE ($28.95): Got it without the lobster, of course. The truffled butter sauce was extremely rich and got old real quick. After the third bite I was not feeling this entree at all. 2/5

COCONUT CAKE ($7.95): The cake looks beautiful but tastes like a store bought cake. I was really disappointed. 2/5

VIBE: Crave is a nicer restaurant with a fancy bar and a proper staff. The bathrooms are gorgeous. On a Tuesday evening, the place was nearly empty. I found it interesting that upon getting seated, our server handed us warm moist towels to clean our hands. That's a first. 4/5 

SERVICE: Started off with a bang but faded off into obscurity. Our waiter disappeared and it took a while to get refills and get the check. 2.5/5

Worth a Return Visit?
After all was said and done, me and my husband agreed that even with the Livingsocial deal, our meal wasn't worth what we paid for. Nah, we won't come back. The highlight of the meal for me was the salad. Nuff said.

{"text":"Honestly I don't know why there so many bad reviews but I had a great experience. We sat at the bar for happy hour and the bartender was super friendly and helpful. Everything we ordered off the happy hour menu was delicious. I definitely will be back and try the full menu next time."}
{"text":"Very poor service. The waiter was extremely slow and inattentive. When our food finally came it was cold and we sent it back. Not very pleased with management ( I can only assume they had a manager, but I never actually saw one). We certainly will never go back. There are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to waste our time and money on this one."}
{"text":"Second visit, they're heading downhill. Service was still pretty good, but the food quality is slipping. Sushi was warm, should be room temp or preferably a little chilled. Paella had a strong vinegar taste. I've made paella and I don't recall adding any vinegar. If it's supposed to contain vinegar, then it has way too much."}
{"text":"Very expensive for bland low quality food. We had the lamb meatballs(very dry) and the sea bass (lacking flavor) and also the street tacos( fatty meat). Didn't meet my expectations for the price we paid"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious with excellent customer service! It's mine and my fiance's go to spot, for great quality dinner at a very reasonable price! Everyone always seems happy to be there serving us! We've gone multiple times and bring others with us and will continue to... I spent my birthday there last night and requested the booth with the curtains, it was a great night with superb service! I had the best birthday. We love CRAVE! Make sure to try the bamboo bites.."}
{"text":"Crave - a strong desire/ yearning for something (usually food, experience). 

This was one of the first few restaurants that opened in Downtown Summerlin and I remember this place being so busy it was so hard to get in. My sister made a reservation for lunch. A few friends of mine warned me about the taste of the food but it was too late and I'm pretty stubborn.

I just had a great shopping trip at my favorite store nearby. I was happy. We walked in and the host took us through a maze of high tables and high chairs. Did you not see my big shopping bags and yoga mat I was knocking things on the tables with? Why would you seat us at cramped tables when you have booths available? Lack of perception and care. Woosah!

CRAVE Grilled Chicken Salad:
Candied walnuts, goat cheese, field greens, grilled chicken breast with balsamic vinaigrette. I was leaning towards the Baby Kale and Steak Salad but this had the place's name in it so, it must be a must-have item, right? Not really. Everything that does not require cooking was ok but the chicken was dry. 2/5

Norwegian Salmon Salad:
Couscous, salmon, quinoa, pomegranate, pickled grapes and wilted spinach. The chef must not be good at checking for meat temperature and doneness. The outside of the fish was cooked but a big portion of the core was not. The manager got involved and offered another piece of cooked salmon. Why can't you just get it right the first time? 1/5

Nigiri:
My sister got salmon and escolar (super white). I didn't have any. The cuts looked good and the fish seemed fresh. I won't ever touch escolar due to its natural laxative properties - I don't need that!

I normally would try to be understanding of things. Mistake after mistake...after we were done, I was yearning for my bathroom. I had plans to continue shopping with my sister but I had to go. I guess it didn't matter if I ate escolar or not, the food here has the same effect. I don't CRAVE for pain and suffering that's for sure. Holy borborygmus, I gotta go!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food was really good, service excellent. Beautiful atmosphere with the wait staff always attentive. If u are a person who loves sushi try this restaurant out, not a large menu but a subtle dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was great, interior is very nice and clean, server was fast and friendly, I definitely will return for the appetizer pizza!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good and I would've called it perfect if the server would have mentioned that the crab cakes came with a side salad.  We probably wouldn't have ordered the house salad if we'd known. We tried the margarita flatbread, the crab cakes, the house salad and the butterscotch pudding. I guess being in the business myself has made me a bit of a picky diner. I wouldn't go back to Crave because the meal we ordered was not worth the $43 bill. The only thing I really liked was the crab cakes and I didn't think they were worth 15 or 16 dollars. They tried to put their own spin on butterscotch pudding. I didn't care for it at all. It was served with an oatmeal cookie than looked and tasted like it came out of a box. I didn't like the margarita flatbread either. The sauce tasted really strange and not pleasant. There's too many dining choices in that area to go back and give them a second chance. We were there on a Friday night and the place was dead so I'm thinking that I'm not the only one thinking the place is not worth the money."}
{"text":"The service was fine but the food was on a fast food level.  The sushi looked and tasted old.  Fries were soggy. There are just way too many great restaurants in Vegas to even think about ever going back. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Front desk seemed a little confused and unorganized. We walked in at lunch time and left my name and number and was told that the table should be ready in about 20 minutes and that I will be receiving a text from them. We took a stroll around the area and went into a couple of the stores nearby to kill some time. 50 minutes had passed by and still no text. My boyfriend and I remembered that there was a BJ's across the street. We went there instead. No regrets (:

I know that this place had just opened up. So hopefully they get it together."}
{"text":"Didn't disappoint!!..Crave is a must but grab a manhattan to chase down that burger!!..."}
{"text":"Great place for the couple where 1 person loves sushi and the other not so much, they can get anything from pasta to a burger and I can get my sushi fix! Rolls aren't too bad def recommend the aloha roll and tuna poke. Tuna is super fresh and was great. Service is great and white sangria was delicious and not too sweet. My only complaint is that it's a tad pricey, but I'm ok with as long as service stays decent."}
{"text":"I had the bison burger with pork belly. The pork belly was under cooked and I got severe food poisoning, which worked out great since it was Christmas eve. I had the worst holiday ever on the toilet.

Besides the food poisoning, the menu is all over the place, the ambience is nothing special, and the food is a bit over priced. I hope this place goes out of business ASAP. Oh, the server took 15 minutes to get my beer as well and they weren't even packed.

This place is GARBAGE."}
{"text":"Our food took so long to come out. On top of that, it comes out and the order was wrong but I was too hungry and exhausted to complain. We paid $15 a plate. The service was very slow even though there weren't very many people in there. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to CRAVE about a half dozen times.  The ambiance is upscale yet comfortable.  The service is always impeccable and the menu has a wide variety for all tastes.  The sushi is very fresh and well done but the offerings are limited. Most of the items either have a deep fried component or spicy mayo, so you might choose another option if those aren't your taste.  The steaks are excellent.  I tried the beef stroganoff most recently and it was good but not great."}
{"text":"It was okay.  Seated quickly...a plus since it was Friday night.  First time here.  Really needed more guidance on specialty entrees  and menu.  Other then specials for charities really didn't get any--note to wait staff.  Drink was Strong!  Appetizers good.  But needed to leave before entrees arrived - because drink was Strong.  They we're packed for take out.  Ate them for lunch, but found them to be nothing special. 
Have to admit it is a large beautiful place.  Wish the food would match."}
{"text":"Update on the update. 
Social media person keeps letting me know that management will contact me.  Because they don't. It's only making me more upset.  Total disregard for their customers
Update almost a year later.
I received a message last week via FB asking for my contact info from Crave.
The message asked for my contact info so new management could contact me regarding our horrible experience.  Well as expected. No one has contacted me.
I had almost forgotten about Crave which was a good thing. Then Crave opens the old can of worms.  The worst customer service I've experienced in years
Fathers Day Dinner
Priceless
We Ordered wine
20 minutes later told there was no wine glasses.
Our Salads sat over 10 minutes at the pass.
We Had to get server to bring them to the table. 
the server Never brought steak knifes nor horseradish. We were supposed to cut our meat with a dull regular knife.
Our granddaughters order sat at the pass for over 10 minutes prior to getting our meal. We had to go up and get it ourself after everyone else had their meals. 
Server was pretty much non existent
Friend Asked for 2nds on prime rib & never received it. Mind you it was all you can eat and there was so much fat she only had a couple of bites from the first piece.
Childs is meal advertised as free on Sunday's. They charged us for it.
We Ordered 2 desserts 5 minutes later we were told the creme brûlée was sold out
We Never received 2nd dessert. 
They didn't deduct anything from the bill.
Food presentation was pathetic.
The diners next to us were so pissed that the gentleman told manager that Crave ruined his life. 
Seriously. 
This has to be one of the worst meals ever.

{"text":"Not worth the hype :( me and my friends desiderate to eat here...well food quality was good, I order there burger I give it a 8/10 services was 2/10 we couldn't even order deserts because  it was taking forever to serve us the place was nice, I decided to park valet, well I had to run to get my car because they close at 9pm kind of dumb when the restaurant close at 10pm kind of  expensive for the experience, will not be back again."}
{"text":"This place is an upscale American/Asian diner. 

The service was friendly and attentive. The meals was delicious. Our party had the chicken wings (yum), sushi (fresh), and the restaurants signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Food was  good , service was HORRIBLE .... waitress only had 4 tables in the whole place as it wasn't busy !! 

and we still waited 15 minutes for water / soda refill..while she walked by the table numerous times.

Watched her talk to other staff and have something to eat with the hostess ... unfortunate !!"}
{"text":"The spinach dip for appetizer was so dry, and same with the sushi and burger we ordered. Didn't bother ordering dessert anymore, and definitely also did not bother signing up for the loyalty rewards because I know I will not come back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to CRAVE. Both times I had the pesto goat cheese hummus and it is by far the best hummus I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and order it! I also had the tempura veggie roll with cream cheese and it was excellent. My husband ordered a burger and requested no cheese. Our waitress told him it doesn't come with cheese, but unfortunately, when he got it, it had cheese on it. The waitress apologized profusely, got him another burger, and gave us a $10 off coupon for our next visit which will hopefully be soon!"}
{"text":"Everyone has the same idea about this place--3 Stars. We went over to crave after looking at the menu because Wolf Gang was closed. Upon entering, the restaurant looks pretty nice. It's interesting because craves menu has a bunch of diff options: tacos, sushi, Korean BBQ, burgers...we thought, what the hell? 

As an appetizer, we ordered jalapeño citrus yellowtail. Prob the best thing we ordered. The fish and mandarin orange sat on top of thinly sliced cucumber. It was so refreshing! 5 TINY pieces for like $12-$13? Also ordered the tomato soup, good but not memorable.

My husband ordered the 702 burger. He said \"it was good.\" It had egg, candied bacon, red onions, spinach, tomato jam. It was really large, he had to cut and eat it with a fork lol.

I ordered Blackened mahi tacos. First off, it wasn't blackened, it was good, nothing exceptional. It had like a corn/jalapeño salsa...good but definitely lacked flavor. 

Our son had the quesadilla with fries. He didn't like either but that's just because he's picky and tired. 

There is an advertisement on every table that says like half price bottled wine on certain days, kids eat free Sun-Tues 11am-close etc. When we got our bill, our sons food was on the ticket which was fine but we asked the waitress do they not do this on holidays? She came back and said management would honor it even though they do not usually do this for holidays. So that was nice.

There are better options. I probably would only come back if every other restaurant was packed and I couldn't wait for a seat. Not bad, just nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered the wedge salad and a 702-burger. The wedge salad was average at best-nothing special. The $17 burger was excellent! The sushi was ok but way overpriced.

Like many reviewers commented, the service is very poor. The food takes FOREVER to come out - even on a Tuesday, early evening with very few customers. This poor service is going to be their downfall."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work. Food was okay, although not as good as I expected. Service was fair. I'll try then again but I'm not overly impressed. The restaurant wad comfortable with a nice decor."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this place. The food is way overpriced and the flavor & taste is mediocre. Service was slow & lack of attention to detail. We had to ask our server for more water. They brought the dessert out way before we were done with our meal."}
{"text":"While it appears to be of something awesome by its outer and inner appearance, sadly, it wasn't for me with the food. BUT!

But here goes to my fair judgment. First impression, 5 stars! From the time we entered, to the hostess seating us and so forth...wonderful! I was excited to stare at the menu. The menu wasn't overwhelming nor was it needing more. Remember, tis all an opinion! 

I was tossing between a bison burger which has pork belly, cilantro, and a couple more add-ons that I can't recall. I just kept reading pork belly, pork belly, pork belly. Lol. Not one to eat pork too often, although, I do enjoy some good home fried or bbq pork belly a few times in a year. So, passed on the bison burger. I ended up ordering the chicken caprese sandwich which is basically chicken, mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes, a drizzle of the balsamic glaze, and placed in tandoori bread. Which is pretty much a pita bread.

How boring I know. But I love caprese anything! Simple ingredients but it could easily be messed up! Plus, it was 7 something at night and i didnt really have the stomach for a burger even though deep down inside i was longing for one. 

When I received my order I thought, aww....this looks deelish. I took a bite and thought damn, I need more of that balsamic glaze because there were droplets of it in my sandwich and I needed more since I could barely taste the balsamic. Waved our waiter down and he happily gave me more. Which by the way our waiter was always in sight!  Alright, so more glaze to drench this sandwich in. 

I didn't really care for this type of sandwich with the tandoori bread. It felt sloppy. It was like eating this giant taco with each bite I had to ensure I gripped that sucker or else it'd fall apart. Annnnd if you didn't bite into it methodically it could get messy. But, probably because I added a little more glaze? Not sure. But it was a little uncomfortable biting into considering it is labeled as a sandwich.

The fries were crispy with a mush. I don't even know how that happens, but I liked it. Didn't get the parmesan fries for a 2.5 dollar upgrade...so regular fries it was. 

I can only offer 2 stars because of the staff and ambiance. My food wasn't something that blew me away or thought, hell yes I'll be back for THAT caprese sandwich. The husband ordered the sandwich that had the apples, brie, and grapes? He usually likes that combo but he too thought twas pretty basic. It truely felt it lacked effort. I mean, how exciting can you make a caprese sandwich. Believe me, I've had perfectly executed caprese whether twas a salad, slider, flatbread, bruschetta, etc....you get it. This really was pretty blunt.

Will I be back? Ummm....maybe just to try the other things in hopes to up my review. How soon? Probably not that soon because there are so much more other eateries there for me to experience first. Will I recommend it? Ummm...probably wouldn't be a place during a convo where I'd even mention it! Nothing memorable. But I wouldn't count them out only because it was my first time there and I only tried 1
 food off their item. 

I do love, though, how they serve each child a bowl of complimentary fruit as all the adults read through the menu. They were very quick to bring that out. That's the way to shut these gremlins up so us adults can focus. Lol.

You try for yourself kind of place.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly! Oh, and a highchair with an actual working buckle!"}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail & decided to give this place a shot. Made reservations for a Saturday night date night. We showed up & waited for our table for about 10 minutes, with reservations but it was a Saturday night so I guess we let that slide. Our waitress was overly stressed out. We ordered drinks and chips & guac. My margarita came in a tumbler, no salt, very little tequila. Our guac was served with shredded lettuce which I found to be odd. Honey ordered steak, I got steak medallions with asparagus. Food was barely warm when we finally got it, but they were nice cuts of meat. Didn't do dessert because the wait times for even water were just too long. We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Slow service, boneless chicken wings on happy hour taste like McDonald's. What happened to this place. Soooo sad."}
{"text":"Overall
   My first and second time dining here were both amazing experiences! During my first visit, my coworker and I had just finished shopping around and were looking for a place to eat and we decided to give Crave a try. Having a wonderful experience there the first time, I told my parents about it and they ate there for lunch for a meeting and soon called me over as well; ending again with a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend this restaurant, but just watch out a bit for the pricing. 

Wait Time & Customer Service
   Hostesses are alright in my opinion, and the wait for us wasn't as long as some other reviewers (do note that it was only the two of us) had experienced; I waited around 10 minutes for an indoor seat my first visit, which isn't bad. The indoors looked pretty classy. Our waitress was absolutely amazing, she was friendly, knowledgable and very attentive. 
   We received exemplary customer service; During our first visit with my coworker the manager paid for one of our desserts just because we couldn't decide between two of their desserts. He (the manager) did initially think that my coworker and I were on a date though, so I believe this would be a great place for a date knowing that the manager's trying to make your date run as smoothly as it can. I don't know if the manager does this 24/7 but, during the first visit the manager was roaming around the restaurant, checking on the customers constantly. I gave the biggest tip I've ever given a restaurant here. 
   During the second visit with my family, again, we had exemplary service. We were seated outdoors at the patio. I don't know if it was super busy that specific day, or if the waiters and waitresses for the patios are just less organized. Our waiter for that day was friendly as well but wasn't as attentive. A few times different waiters came to our table with something that wasn't ours (but all of the food we had ordered had been served already) and at some point went from table to table asking if they had ordered what she was carrying. It wasn't bad though, we're all human and they just opened so there will always be a few kinks here and there. I overall definitely recommend this restaurant.

Food
  During my first visit I had the Filet Mignon, which by the way, is the best Filet Mignon I've ever had! It was very juicy and had lots of flavor, I find their Filet Mignon better than Cheesecake Factory's (and Crave's Mignon is a bit bigger). It's accompanied with \"potato puree, caramelized brussels sprouts, [and] topped with garlic butter\" which is a perfect (I guess you would call it) side to the dish. My coworker had the Ribeye which is also accompanied with the same sides as the Mignon. I had a taste of his Ribeye and it was pretty delicious too I'd give the Ribeye about four stars and the Mignon five stars. We also ordered the sushi, Godzilla. Very delicious. I'd give that about five stars as well. 
   With the desserts that night, we had the Smore's Brownie and Signature Cheesecake. We devoured the smores, and we didn't really eat much of the cheesecake. The smores had the perfect balance of sweet flavors: five stars. The cheesecake was ok but nothing really special: three stars. 
   During my second visit I initially wanted to have the Filet Mignon again (it's that good) however, I'm a person who loves to try new things so I went for the Pork Tenderloin instead. The Tenderloins were not as delicious. It was kind of dry, but manageable, nothing really special in my opinion: three stars. 
   My Father had Half Roasted Chicken, which was absolutely delicious; I took a taste of it as well! It contains rice, bits of grilled pineapple, and \"jalapeno orange glaze\". The chicken was juicy and seasoned deliciously, and with the pineapple and the orange glaze it tasted delicious altogether: five stars! My Mother had the Chicken Stir Fry, (which again, I had a taste of. I'm a foodie) it was okay for me, around three stars. My Mother however found it to be too salty for her, and asked if she could have something else (which they happily obliged) and then ordered the Half Roasted Chicken.
    Both times that I was here I had some tea with peach in it (different drinks) the first one was mixed with raspberry I believe, and it was okay. The plain peach tea was not sweet enough for me, so it'll be good for those who like not-too-sweet drinks. Wait time for the food wasn't that long as well, pretty average wait time for a restaurant. 
   The food overall? 4.5 Stars

Pricing
   The prices of the food here are kind of pricy, but my coworker and I thought it was worth it; I think they would have even more business if they maybe lowered the prices a bit. The bill for my coworker and I came up to the low $100, with the cheesecake being free (Filet Mignon, Ribeye, Godzilla, Cheesecake, Smores, Peach tea, Raspberry  tea). I do not know of the total bill for the lunch meeting during my second visit, but as far as I know, there were no complaints."}
{"text":"Been here many, many times. Love the happy hour. We came here for lunch and ordered off the regular menu recently. Most from my party had burgers. They enjoyed them and said they were juicy and full of flavor. I had sushi, which was great as always. Our waitress made us some sort of lemonade concoction she recommend...turned out to be delicious AND bottomless! 

The only thing I noticed was the hostess (seemed to be new) disappeared from her booth. We could see the main entrance from where we were seated. We noticed a family with two small girls waiting around to be seated for almost 15 minutes. The bartender eventually saw them and apologized. That's the only down-side I saw. Even when it gets slow, make sure your hostess is where she's supposed to be. 

Otherwise, great food and service at our table! Will be back."}
{"text":"A half-hour wait, expected on a Friday evening.  Menu contained a good mixture of American and Japanese selections.  Kids entrees were on the house."}
{"text":"Crave for lunch and drinks. My friend and I had the Hoshii Boat which is a small boat and a small amount of sushi. We also had the scallop poppers which is baked scallops wrapped in salmon with dynamite sauce it was delicious. I have to say I will be back for the drinks. My friend and I enjoyed the white sangria  it was refreshing!  I would also like to try other dishes on the menu. Our waitress was also super nice made us feel comfortable and was friendly."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. The service was good and we were seated right away. The crab and artichoke dip wasn't bad but the 2 bento boxes and the premium bento box were terrible. The panko shrimp was basically all panko. The sushi tasted fishy. I was going to give the place a second chance but when i saw the bill i changed my mind. For the price we payed and the location, I was expecting a lot more. I'm not saying that you shouldn't go and give crave a chance but, yeah i was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I am giving it three stars mostly because it was a terrible value.  The service was pretty good.  Not stellar but I had no complaints.  The food was good.  I mean really good but not OMG amazing.  We split a chicken salad which was the star of the meal.  14 bucks for a lunch portion salad.  We each orders the sushi lunch combo which is a midi soup, one 6 piece roll and 4 pieces of nigiri.  Again, it was all tasty and presented well.  14 bucks each for the combos.  Just ordered water to drink in order to better enjoy the Unami of the sushi.  Total bill.....almost 24 bucks each so all in 28 dollars for lunch.   To me, a bit overpriced considering the choices Vegas has to offer.  

I don't consider myself a cheapskate, so I think I am pretty accurate in my value ratio.  The food was good, not a single complaint.......it just wasn't 28 dollars of good."}
{"text":"The worst service ever wait to be greeted like 15 to 20 minutes after that I had two different servers both of them in bad mood I just paid my wine and left I was here before really enjoy service and food no any more"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was kind of skeptical to try this place out. Most people complained about long waits to get seated and for food to come out. But as a new restaurant I know they're probably still adjusting and learning so I tried anyways.

I was not disappointed.  We did get seated immediately,  I guess we were lucky. I had a hard time deciding so our waiter helped us decide. I wanted a burger so he highly recommended the bison burger.  And if anyone is planning on eating there, please please please try it. It was the best burger I ever had! 

The peach ice tea on the other hand did not taste good. It wasn't sweet at all. So I don't recommend that. 

Price was a little high I must say

But other than that it was good. I will be going back in the future. We had excellent customer service when I went"}
{"text":"Don't bother,I'm not sure what was worse,the service,the prices  or the food
Slow service ,overpriced menu and terrible food
Sent back the raw chicken pesto and choked down an ice cold burger"}
{"text":"Wow, all three entrees ordered - Poke bowl, fried rice, and penne pasta with chicken - were totally uninspired, bland, overpriced, and arrived after more than 30 minutes when they weren't that busy. How they stay open is a mystery."}
{"text":"Food was good service is horrible. After being told we would be text in 30 mins when our table was ready we went outside to wait. 40 minutes went by and no text, no one came outside. So we went inside and they said we wrote your number down wrong. Your table is ready.  We waited another 15minutes for our table. We finally ordered, meals were coming out except they for got to serve our main course. 1 hour and 30 minutes later we decide to go. Manager comes to our table to apologize stating the kitchen thought they served us our main course. We were given our meals to go. I was very disappointed seeing this was our first time eating here and it was Valentine's Day dinner. Someone needs to be fired as the management here and food expeditors were relatively nonexistent. Very disorganized."}
{"text":"Dined here over the holidays with a out of town friend. We arrived fairly early in the evening via the back door and were seated at a high top. I will tell you this, the chairs to the high tops stink! They are super uncomfortable and not a lot of room for your booty! The menu offers a huge variety of choices and the Happy Hour menu is decent.  Since it was happy hour, this is the menu we stuck with. We ordered up a sampling of sushi, miso soup, edamame for our first go round. I really appreciated our server advising us of which dishes she felt were the best. Note to self, never order sushi unless you are in a sushi house! I was sorely disappointed with the sushi and let my friend eat most of it. The miso soup had the oddest taste and I could not finish it. The edamame was ok but how much can you screw up edamame?? We then tried the lemon garlic wings and the mini pesto chicken flat bread which were actually quite tasty and these made up for the poor tasting sushi. The wine choices were the best part of my experience at CRAVE. The \"Freakshow\" Cabernet was so yummy. We had to have a couple of glasses. This is a wine I have always wanted to try and it did not disappoint. Overall the service was A++. Our server was attentive and friendly and we enjoyed talking about wine with her. As we lingered, the restaurant began to fill up with holiday shoppers and then they had to move our table which we didn't mind as \"The Human Jukebox\" was setting up to provide some holiday fun and entertainment. He made the night, by playing all kinds or requests from holiday to classics. I may go back again in the future to try an actual entree as the location of this restaurant is very close to where I live which makes it a convenient place to have a bite."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a party of 6 adults at 5:30 pm ,  upon arriving the table was not set yet - even though restaurant was fairly empty.
Got seated in the back behind the bar and 
Sat there the staff kept looking at our table as to who was going to be our server ! 
Finally someone came over to help us , we ordered 
Well the whole time it was freezing in the restaurant we all kept out jackets on no a very comfortable eating setting.
3 of us ordered salads which on the menu had a variety of stuff in each ,  where ? 
The portions were very small compared to the price paid !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cheap with the avocado that was supposed to be included in the salad maybe a few pieces .
Also a few sushi rolls were ordered and guess what had to pay extra for ponzu sauces , who does that i never heard of this before . 

Wanted cappuccino after the small meal waitress said machine is broken and referred us to a clothing store with a cafe in it .


Well sorry CRAVE won't be back ,  pay all that money and leave hungry does not work with me !"}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience here last night. Ordered sushi, and while the waitress was very sweet and did what she could, the sushi took far too long and was far too overpriced for the quality of the food and sushi service. It took 15 min for miso soup, over 40 mins for our sushi (small sushi plate, 4 rolls and caterpillar role) and over 1 hour for the tempura bites. When the manager stopped by, he only apologized for the wait. It's common practice in the restaurant industry to comp some part of the meal. On an $80 dinner, only the tempura bites were comped ($6), which was told to us by our waitress. Supremely disappointed with our choice, will not be coming back and i will be advising anyone who asks about this restaurant to do themselves a favor and go to an AYCE restaurant where you will get the same quality at a better price!"}
{"text":"Gr8 selection of dishes.  Lunch is a bargain w/big servings.  Dinner prices go up for same portions.  Service is good.  I like the salmon, chicken brie sandwich and sushi.  Spacious and beautiful ambience w/nice tables and booths.  Gr8 bar and happy hour."}
{"text":"I loved the salmon salad!  So good I wanted to lick the plate clean.  Granted, the service was a bit off but our server was nice.  The truffle fries were YUM.  I would go back just for the salad."}
{"text":"The atmosphere vibe and service are amazing.
The bread basket is very tasty.

I orders the BLT....really very good.

I love the place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic time Friday night at Crave - we eat alot of restaurants in Vegas and also base alot of dinner outings on Yelp reviews. I heard some good things about this place but with a 2.5 rating I was a little skeptical. This rating proved to be wrong. The whole night was perfect from the food and decor to the waiter (Marianna). Starting off with bread basket, sashimi (very fresh yellowtail)  and crab cakes the cakes were very tasty and the jalapeno tartar sauce went perfect with them. Dinner was Mahi Mahi for my wife and I had the Sea Bass. Both pieces cooked perfectly and the sauces that accented both were spot on. The flavors all just worked perfectly together on both plates. Desserts were tiramisu and I want to say a hazelnut pudding? Cant recall but it was a bit grain for my taste, but the flavor was good. Tiramisu was not too traditional but again really flavorful. We ended the night with Almond Coffee which was really a great ending note and was pretty damn good - we had to have a second one before heading out.

On a side note Drinks were all perfect from the bar and their mixed drink menu was pretty good - ginger lime Margarita is worth trying. The biggest plus of the night was our waitress Marianna - probably one of the best we have encountered at any restaurant and was on top of everything throughout the night. From recommendations paired with drinks to explanations of each dish she was all around worth asking for on your next visit. 

Dont base this place on the 2.5 stars it has right now - these will go up. There was obviously some issues upon opening which any restaurant will have - especially when you try to match ticket times from a main kitchen to a sushi kitchen. I was a chef for years in Las Vegas and observe what goes on in restaurants very closely when I visit - they have obviously pulled it together here - its worth the visit."}
{"text":"My first time here and I wasn't disappointed.  Our waiter, Jordan, was very attentive and quick(and witty too). He answered all our questions and made sure that our drinks were never empty.  The food was also very delicious and we didn't have to wait very long for it either.  I ordered the 702 Burger and my friend got the Bison Burger. We even made sure to ask for a side of ranch when we ordered or food and didn't have to remind our waiter about it because he had it on our plates upon delivery.   Although it is a bit pricey, the delicious food and excellent customer service make it worth every penny."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I had received a message from the company and sent them my info but did not get any response back. I have not returned here. I am not looking for anything from them but would like to state that i haven't had the chance to give them another try."}
{"text":"Not the best experience we've had... The server was very attentive but unfortunately the food fell flat... We did enjoy the sushi roll for our app but my husbands burger was not cooked properly and his fries were cold ! Also I had the salmon and it smelt extremely fishy which usually means it's not fresh .. Ruined my appetite and sent it back .. Was excited about this place but unfortunately won't be returning"}
{"text":"We ate at Crave last night, expecting a nice dinner to enjoy with our friends for their last night in town.  The hosted Chyna was lovely, but beyond that the service was lacking.  I wish we had chosen another restaurant.  We had been to Crave once before and because our food was really good, we had forgotten that we  had almost left due to the extreme long wait for a server to even acknowledge that we had been seated.  On this night, our 3 children were dining with us and from the time we sat down until we asked about the progress of our food, it had already been over a 40 min. wait.  A good waitress would have submitted our children's orders immediately.  When we inquired about the food the waitress Julie stated that she didn't enter our food order until 10mins after the appetizer was brought out - only one appetizer was order and it didn't come out for over 20mins.  Her remarks were said in a snarky tone, as if we should be grateful for her failure to realize small children were at the table.  Children have a hard enough time waiting 20mins let alone the almost 60+mins from the time we were seated to receiving their food.  We appreciate they brought fruit bowls to the table for the kiddos, but the fruit was sour and was old, hence none of our fruit loving kids ate the fruit provided.  We watched our plates sit under the heating lamps for over 20mins before being served, I imagine they were waiting for the other meals to be completed.  Just in case you were wondering the restaurant was only about 1/4 full and we seated about 7:15.  When the meals arrived to the table, we were very hungry.  My Bison burger was tasty, however luke warm, as was the rest of meals at the table.  The kids food was barely warm.  A manager, Joe,  passed by with plates in hand for another table, asking how are meal was...we didn't have time to actually answer him, nor was his question sincere.  He stated he would \"be right back\" but that was not the case.  A few customer service 101 tips: When something goes wrong, ie, slow, slow food service, especially for children, don't give or make excuses...simple say you are sorry and correct it quickly.  As a bonus bring the kids some chips, bread...anything (edible) when there is an extended wait.  If you want to ask your customer how there food/experience is, be genuine and have time to listen.  I have a Crave loyalty card and I really want to love this place, there are some great tasting dishes, the cooks are clearly not the issue.  However, I don't for see us going back or recommending it to friends because the restaurant truly lacks great servers and management."}
{"text":"OK, this review is on the mac and cheese only, because that's all I ate. Yep, big enough for the main course. I had it with the apple sausage mixed. Loved it."}
{"text":"Ok, Kelvin is an excellent sushi chef with his own creations, we tried the Middle Eastern ceviche and it was wonderful. My wife says the edemame was good. The steak was alright, my son was not happy with it. Service was good, not too bad . Just walk in and go to sushi. These chefs invent stuff, the ceviche, so good. Making this place a regular hang out"}
{"text":"5/5 or the food
1/5 for the service

We came here with a group of 20 for a birthday dinner, and we sat down at 9pm. We ordered at about 9:30, got our food at 10. One thing was she didn't ask us for our drinks. She just assumed everyone wanted water.  We finished eating at 10:30, waiting for our checks. As I am writing this review now, at 10:54 p.m., we are waiting to pay for our bill. It took 25 minutes for the check! That's a pretty long time.

The food, however, was good. We ordered a rib eye steak and Mac n cheese. The Mac and cheese is alright, but the steak was packed with flavor! I really loved it. 

Like most of the reviews here, service needs to improve."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I discovered it and ate here 3 times in the past three days. Service is great! Ask for Jordan, he's funny and gets things to you right away. Also, definitely get the calamari no matter what you end up ordering for the entrée. Delicious."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but was EXTREMELY disappointed! The server was clueless and gave us the wrong information. Ended up moving tables because sat by cold front door area. Waited for service,
but server never came back. Moved to bar and totally regretted that because the bartender was soooooo rude. Very short w us when he took our order like we were completely bothering him. We observed him with the other guests and he was the same way with them. Our food came out wrong and he blamed us! We showed him what we ordered on the menu and what was supposed to come, but he got defensive and was almost fighting with us. So crazy!!! I have worked in the hospitality industry for 15 years and have never seen anything like it. I will never go back to this place and will advise anyone who asks not to bother trying it. They need to start fresh with staff that is competent and actually want to be there. Your food can be great, but if your service is terrible, your restaurant is doomed to fail miserably...but the food was mediocre so good luck..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The food is delicious, the service is stellar, and the ambiance is yummy!  I love sushi and my man likes hamburger - they make them both to perfection!  We've eaten at Crave about 10 times, and never had a bad meal, bad service, or a bad experience.  We've brought friends and family, and each guest loves it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out fit for a while. We decided to go try the Happy Hour. I really liked the choices they had. My friend and I ordered drinks, pretty good. I ordered the kinky mojito. I ordered the kogi tacos. The big plate they used made the serving size even smaller. It was only 2 tacos... Kinda small. Wished they added 3. My friend ordered the Apple sausage flatbread. Looked pretty good. My other friend ordered pork belly sliders. She says there wasn't that much pork in hers and it was just 2 sliders too. At least at cheese cake factory they would give you 4 or 6 I believe. The decor was really nice. Looked modern. We sat at the bar,i didn't know it would be that loud. The staff was very nice. The hostess sat us right away when we decided to sit somewhere else since you can only try happy hour at or around the bar. I would try to go back there and try the regular size food next time instead of just the Happy Hour"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Crave.   I brought my dad for father's day because of all you can eat prime rib and the first time we came we loved the service and the food. 

However, this time was kind of a disaster.    The service was so slow.    We sat for at least 10 minutes before we put in an app order.   We got our apps even before we ordered our main dishes.  We never got one drink refill because we hardly ever saw the server. 

The food was also just ok all around.   Not terrible, not good.   

Overall I don't think I want to come back which is disappointing because after the first time here I couldn't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fancy inside. A really nice looking restaurant with a large center bar with plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio area. 

My friend and I decided to give it a try. He had already been to Wolfgang Puck's (I haven't so that's another future review). We ordered the crab/artichoke dip in a lemony mayo sauce which was pretty tasty, but lacking a lot of crab. ($14).
For dinner my friend ordered the Chicken stir fry ($20) which he said had good flavor but the noodles were undercooked and the veggies overcooked. I will note that our bartender did try to talk him out of that selection.
I had the Norwegian Salmon in a mustard sauce and that was pretty good. I enjoyed the flavors and the salmon was cooked nicely. I would order this meal again. $27.

They get lower stars due to two main factors. One - my friends Chicken stir fry meal and 2 - we sat at the bar, and my cocktail sat empty for almost 10 minutes while 3 bartenders looked and walked by. That's not good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out The Crave since it opened and finally made it in. We stopped in after 9pm so the rush was over and we're seated quickly by a very nice hostess. Mike was our server and was awesome. We were impressed by the menu selection and settled on a starter of quacamole and chips, it was good but not great. For my main course I'm a sucker for a.good Bison burger so I gave it a try along with some well seasoned fries and was not disappointed. With such a diverse menu and excellent service by Mike we'll be back to try some other dishes. Overall, 4 stars for our first go. And I'd say The Crave has the potential to be our go to spot in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Got the scallops & risotto, it was ok good not great. $30 for 4 scallops and a small scoop of risotto.  Friends got the crab topped steak filet...they said it was just ok.  Don't waste your money....there are many better restaurants around here."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and the food is ok but the service is horrible.  Our waitress took 20-30 minutes to get my table drinks. Then it took another 15 minutes to get lemon for our water. We sat next to the bar. I could of water over and got the lemon. Not once did our waitress apologized for not checking on us or how long it took to get drinks and serviced. I stood up twice and both times she walked past our table and said nothing.  The only plus here is that the food comes out fast. The food runners have better service than our waitress. If it was not for the food coming out fast I would have not tipped at all. We were 5 minutes away from leaving the restaurant. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now and are probably not going to again...  

The first time we came was 9:00 on a Friday night, it was mostly empty, and we were seated promptly. The food came out quickly. I really enjoyed my lettuce wraps because they were already assembled! My husband loved his sake and his sushi roll. The server was happy and friendly. I got a coupon in the mail which I actually remembered to use for once! It was just the two of us and we had a good experience overall. 

The second time was 9:00 on a Saturday night, it was mostly empty (again) and we were seated promptly. The server seemed put-out by the 5 of us being there. We ordered our drinks and the other 4 people at my table got them at one time and my glass of wine came 15 minutes later. When it finally arrived, he said \"Sorry, we had to open a new bottle of wine\". Since when does it take 15 minutes to open a bottle wine in a mostly empty restaurant? Then the food finally came out and the guy quickly disappeared before my husband (who got sushi) could realize he had no chop sticks! Since the server didn't return for 15 minutes, he ate half of his dish with a fork before he could even ask for chop sticks... fail! Then he brought us the bill and disappeared without saying anything. We were like, wait, we wanted to order another round of drinks. What if we wanted dessert? Ok, we get the hint, we will pay and leave. Seriously, we got the hint!"}
{"text":"This was a new place to try, for lunch, they have a good variety of foods and decent portions, I would definately go back to this place again, the waiter was very nice and attentive to our needs. The price is good too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place.  Went for dinner on Father's day.  Service was a bit slow, not that it was the server's fault, they were woefully understaffed.  I've been here twice before and the service has been good, friendly, timely, and interactive, so I think this time was more of a scheduling mishap.

The food I've ordered is very good, I've ordered off the menu, Gorgonzola Stuffed Chicken last time, and Salmon this time.  Both were excellent, though I think I like the Chicken better.  On Father's day, both my Dad and Mom had the Prime Rib special, which was anything but special.  Super thin, over cooked greyish-brown lump.  But, not one of their normal dishes, so maybe a one off mistake.  It was all-you-can-eat, and when the server came with the second round, the meat looked the same, so we said no thanks, and left it at that.

I'll be back though!  Fun place with a lively crowd, especially at the bar.  They must have a decent happy-hour since I've seen the bar busy the 3 times I've been."}
{"text":"Even after my wife and I (accidentally) made two reservations for 7pm we still had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. And we were seated in the Bar, not the restaurant. Okay so be it. It doesn't get any better though. The wine was rancid, the margarita was lame and the main course came 5 minutes after the soups and salads were delivered. It was a disaster and the worse part is the food was just okay. I so want local restaurants to succeed however Crave has some work to do if they are going to last."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. The waiter was nice. Restaurant was empty at 6:00 on a Saturday. Don't attempt to go here if you go gluten free! Can't say I feel good 24 hours after.  I had the lamb meatballs and rice noodles. All of it was completely over cooked and I am pretty sure it was put in a microwave. The rice noodles they replace the pasta with were soggy and I could only get two inch pieces at most on my fork, because they were so overcooked. It was in a green sauce. Not sure you could say it was cream sauce as most of it was soaked up by the noodles and it was green? Can't understand the choice of rice noodles as there so many other options of pasta that taste amazing as GF. The meatballs were completely dry and tasteless and the tomato garnish was as dry as a potato chip. Maybe an attempt at their own sun dried tomato? Not feeling this restaurant. Kids and husband had pizza flatbread that they said was Ok. My six year old had chicken fingers that could have come from a cheap diner and wouldn't eat the fries. Ice cream sandwiches down the street saved the night. Don't bother going here. So many better options a walk away in Downtown Summerlin. Can't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to crave after receiving a coupon for by 1 entree get 1 free. We had a reservation and were sat right away. The reservation didn't seem necessary even though it was Sunday lunch time. Our server was nice and attentive. We ordered Salmon Sashimi which was ok. Then our entrees came out. I had steak sliders that was beyond boring in flavor. It was so bland that I could hardly make out anything I was eating and my fries looked old and also was lacking in flavor. My husband had the Steak, he asked for medium cooked but all we could taste was burnt meat, it was tasteless even after asking for a1 sauce. I was glad we had that coupon since paying for a disappointing meal is never a good time. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came here at 9pm, hungry. I ordered the philly roll, #9, dynamite, and parmesan truffle fries. They got my order wrong, but that's just minor. My fries were soggy and cold, the philly roll had lettuce in it (and it tasted gross), #9 roll (nothing special,lots of greens), and at all normal sushi restaurants the \"dynamite\" roll is a baked roll. Not this one. It has some kind of mashed fish with more greens. Have you ever been to Yardhouse? I would give Yardhouse food 5stars compared to this. This is Yardhouse like food, done wrong, and they don't know how to do sushi. DO NOT COME HERE FOR SUSHI. Food, one stars, service, two stars. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stars if not for slow service.  Restaurant had us wait 10-15 minutes despite not being overly busy.  Ratio of diners to staff seemed off and staff was scrambling to keep up.  Wife loved  her soup, and food was good.  Not over the top and you are certainly paying for the environment and aura but it just did not do it for me.  It was a race to wait, wait for a table, wait for a server, wait for food, wait for a beverage refill (which we were never offered or had a chance to ask for).  Check took 15 minutes to arrive, another 10 to get picked up by a manager who acted like they were doing us a favor. With lots of other choices here in Downtown Summerlin Crave might be a middle of the pack choice in the future."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour, so I cannot comment on their regular menu. Most of everything I ordered was below average to average. 

I personally love California rolls, and it was my fave out of all the HH food items we ordered. They serve Tenaya Brewery beer on tap, and had some good stuff during HH.

I walked away however, feeling that I am okay never coming back. At least for the food."}
{"text":"My first visit here was a refreshing new dining experience.  My party of four was greeted warmly by the hostess, and we were quickly escorted to our reserved booth amidst the plush decor and opulent design of this relatively new addition to Downtown Summerlin.

Pan-fried Pork Dumplings was a good opener.  A cup of seasonal Lamb Meatball Soup was so spicy it literally took my breath away, but was nevertheless quite tasty.  To the degree that next time I will order a bowl!  Pan-fried Pork Dumplings were crispy and also tasty.

A nicely laid out massive Wedge Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing was a refreshing starter.  And Pita Bread from an ordered Bread Basket was supple and fine.  

For my entree, Beef Stroganoff, with Braised Short Rib, Mushroom Cream Sauce, and a large dab of Horseradish Chive Sour Cream was meaty and quite satisfying.  And, seated beside me, Diane very much enjoyed her real creamy Mac & Cheese.  

Dakota, our server, was friendly, helpful, and proficient in all waitressing tasks  The restaurant manager stopped by three times to chat briefly with us and check on our dining progress.  Afterwards, our dining companions were effusive in their praise for this restaurant.  And, I will surely be back!

4-1/2 stars overall on this autumn night!"}
{"text":"Tried 4 different flatbreads, 3 sushi, lobster linguini, meat balls, 3 different beers, cocktails, and white wine, nothing is good. The only thing that is fine is the chicken flatbread. 
The server, Darius, is attentive and friendly while others are not.
Will not come back unless I take my puppy here to enjoy their patio and open air."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have awesome drinks, both alcoholic and non. An awesome variety of food and if you feel like sushi, they have it, too! And it is great! More chilled than Kona, with all the middle aged meat market, and better food menu than Cheesecake Fcty. 

We belong to their loyalty club, and get points that add to pretty nice discounts. Service is always chilled and know their menu. 

We enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful inside but I would recommend ordering your food to go. Service is alway mediocre...wait staff seems unengaged and they move at a sloths pace. Dining with children is a tough enough task but when it takes your waiter/waitress forever to grab drinks or even forget to check on you mid meal your experience goes from good to bad because your feel the need to get out of there ASAP. What I thought would be a quick meal in a restaurant that was nearly empty took about 1 hour and 45 mins. Way to long with children."}
{"text":"This is our first time venturing through Summerlin area.  We didn't know what to expect, walking through this deserted shopping center.  

We saw the menu, saw they have gluten-free, so I'm testing a new diet to see what my allergies are.  I never knew how hard it was to eat GF, dairy and soy free, when dining out.  

The sushi is nothing to run home to, but at least it was decent.  My chicken and rice noodle dish was a good-interesting, really flavorful, also filling down to the last bite.  Not good for low carb, but perfect for gluten-free, minus the goat cheese for a non-dairy meal.  I always associate rice noodles with my Chinese flavored broth, but this lightly salted, olive oil concoction was surprisingly great.   

This place has the generic contemporary sort of look, nice choice of orange/red tinge to their decor.  Service was slow to start off, until I made a remark and the waiter was super attentive throughout our entire meal.  Now, that's customer service."}
{"text":"Here is my review of the restaurant. The decor is nice and modern, upscale looking but the food doesn't match the ambience. Portions are small and bland. Do not order Steak Sliders if you are hungry!! It's consider an entree/burger which looks like it should be an appetizer $14.95!! A White Castle burger is bigger than the sliders I got. The wait staff was decent and friendly which is why I gave 2 stars. FYI you'll be \"Crave\"ing that you had more food on your plate. Pass!!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Crave with my boyfriend for a cocktail and a snack.  I tried the blueberry lemonade which was great, I enjoyed the flavor- it was a perfect mix without being too sweet! We ordered an appetizer, which was tasty. I want to say I like Crave, although the service was lacking. I know that Crave is one of a few restaurants open in Downtown Summerlin at this time, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that the service will improve, I think they have the cocktails and food to be successful, they just need the service and hospitality to catch up with it."}
{"text":"Very average.  Description of food was way better then the taste. I'm sure after a few months they will get their menu straight."}
{"text":"Brianna the hostess was absolutely amazing and so helpful. She was so greeting at the door and made the visit so comfortable. She definitely needs to be a server soon. The food and service was also very good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and were given menus. Then we were subsequently ignored for 15 minutes after putting the menus aside. Customers around us were served multiple times but we were not addressed at all. They were busy, but there were 7 bartenders for 12-15 customers at the bar. There's really no excuse for the bad service. After futilely waiting for a few more minutes, just sitting and waiting, we left. I will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visited Memorial Day. Nice looking place, waited a few minutes fro a greeter to arrive, some what bizarre for the size of place. Waitstaff was very friendly but overworked. 
Food could have been great, but seasonings way off. Beef taco, too salty to eat, Mac and cheese bland, Maui Maui was overcooked and no seasoning. The food looked great, but not tasty.  Server never brought wine ordered to wife, so she had enough. Happy hour prices were not discounted on ticket. $81 for 2 adults and one teen, not worth the cost.

Maybe a good place to go after work and have a drink in bar, nice atmosphere. If you want dinner, Yard House a similar concept, much better choice."}
{"text":"I'd like to review an entire experience at this restaurant, but we sat for 10 minutes at our table without acknowledgement from wait staff or management. We left. Sunday, 1 PM, far from full. I guess that is a review.

Went upstairs to Public School 702 immediately after leaving. Seated with water and drink orders in - less than 5 min. Just for reference."}
{"text":"We love this place. Kid meal is free everyday with a purchase of adult entree. Their loyalty program is great!, you get credits for signing up, your birthday and anniversary. The food are delicious, I love that you can have sushi and American meal too. And our waiter Zaid took a very good care of us!"}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced sushi. I've had better sushi at 7/11. Tried multiple items on the sushi menu and they all lacked taste and quality. Service was mediocre as the waiter seemed in a rush all the time and did not want to wait till we finish our sentence while ordering and got a bunch of things wrong , 

Never again"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit and only returned because we had a coupon. First visit was opening day, so we gave some slack on the lousy service. Second visit we were seated in the back which is dark and uninviting and service lacked. We said that was our last visit. When coupon came in mail we gave it another shot. Food is good but the service has been slow and inattentive on each visit. Too many good restaurants in Summerlin to come again. I predict this place won't last."}
