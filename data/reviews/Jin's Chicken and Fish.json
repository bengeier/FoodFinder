{"text":"You always know you've had a good night when you wake next to a crumpled up Jin's sandwich wrapper.   Jin's popularity is undeniable, and for good reason.  Two options, chicken or fish, have sustained Jin's for years, but recently, a second location has opened up.  The original Jin's cart still stands firm in Library Mall providing nourishment for the weary masses, but a flashier version has opened up on Gorham just off of State Street.  The new cart is called JD's, but don't be alarmed, you can still order chicken or fish.  In addition, JD's sells Polish sausages and Chicago Dogs.  For some, the options can seem overwhelming, but if you're lucky enough to have any cash left in your wallet at the end of a night, whichever meal you choose will be more satisfying than anything else you can find downtown late night."}
{"text":"Any true Wisconsin student knows about Jins. Although there is usually a 5-10 minute line at the best, it is well worth the wait considering there is no other food in all of Madison that hits the spot after a long night of drinking/partying. If you are in Madison, you have to try it at least once. Definitely go chicken."}
{"text":"One of my colleague's, Jen B., who, in addition to really loving chicken sandwiches, is the office expert on dump cakes and Will's hair.  Not sure how she became such a foodie or into Will's flow but good for her.  Anyways, she really loves this place.  In fact, she is a vegetarian but likes to use her meat cheats at Jin's."}
{"text":"I had the fish sandwich, minus the hot sauce. I guess that's why I'm giving it only three stars, versus the 4-5 star ratings these folks have posted. I can't handle any hotness, I guess it's because I am so hot already. ;) (sorry for the corny joke!)  The fish itself was fried and not greasy, but it was too salty!   I much prefer the bacon wrapped hot dogs in the slums of downtown LA. But I can see why people would like this stand. Plus, there's tons of drunk folks doing dumb, drunk shenanigans. (Such as throwing a drunk friend into the huge, disgusting dumpsters in front of the stand.) Free entertainment rules!"}
{"text":"This place is infamous. Once I heard a University of MN-Twin Cities class of 2000 alumnus talking about how he'd driven from Minneapolis to Madison (four hours) basically for a sandwich at Jins - and this conversation was in 2005!   The previous commenter majorly underestimates - usually on weekends in particular, there was a line between ten to thirty minutes! If not more! Even when it was fricking FREEZING outside, it's Wisconsin! and most people were hammered. The point is waiting is an experience, since people are so messed up, you'll probably either see a fight or guys hitting on women like asshats or dancing to the 90s rap played by the tv in the window of the trailer. Go sober, the spectacle is something. Jin's started offering expedited service for an additional $5, you could walk up to the backdoor and get your sandwich next. When you're drunk and don't give a damn, that's a good deal.  A friend of mine at one point was going EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, no lie. To the point where he actually became so familiar with the owner that he GOT A JOB WITH JIN'S, which is ridiculous since, as others have already noted, it's like two people working in a trailer, they really don't need the extra help. Craziness.  Never tried the fish but the chicken is really great. Granted, once when I'd had a few adult beverages, I ate two and felt like I was about to die...  Where exactly this place is now, or if it will be around in the future, I'm not sure, since they were having issues with the city. I know students hope it'll be around forever."}
{"text":"Jin's has been around for as long as I can remember--I thought it was a late night food cart owned by an Asian man but it actually is the acronym for the first letter of the owner's three sons. A gloriously glutenous late night meal you can't go wrong with.  I personally prefer the catfish in it's all it's fried goodness.  Notoriously popular on campus--seriously go get yours!"}
{"text":"Line is long during after bar hours.  They got a flat screen with music videos playing while you are waiting in line.  They have a \"VIP\" where you pay twice the price for the sandwich and you get to skip the line.  Seriously.  The catfish sandwich is perfectly fried with some lettuce, hot sauce and mayo.  Great to soak the alcohol up with."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, after 2am anything fried on a bun with lettuce mayo and Frank's hot sauce = heaven  I prefer the fish, but realistically at 2-3am I probably would be able to tell the difference if I got the fish.  Huge fan of the food, not a huge fan of the service. I once waited 2 hours in line for this sandwich and it was everything that I wanted it to be, but come'on it should really take less than 2 hours to serve a total of 15 people. Two stars removed solely based on operations and customer service."}
{"text":"Greatest late night chicken sandwich ever.  I'm going to wax nostalgic for a second and say that JIN's used to be so much better when it was just chicken out of a trailer.  Nothing else, no rap videos.  Just delicious, unhealthy, delicious fried chicken.  Homecoming 2012, it's on."}
{"text":"Great! Best late night cart in downtown Madison"}
