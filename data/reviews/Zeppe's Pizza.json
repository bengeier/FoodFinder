{"text":"To say that Seppe's pizza is ordinary would be an extreme compliment. No taste , very little sauce."}
{"text":"The customer service and food was awesome!  I will be returning!!  The food was ordered the night before the Superbowl and was hot and ready on time Superbowl day."}
{"text":"The carry out pizzas at this location is great!  Full of flavor, plenty of toppings....great staff.
I will order from this Zeppe's again for sure.
The specialty Trio Rocks!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit surprised.  It is a chain after all and a pizza place that sells fried chicken.  So expectations were not really that high. 

The interior is not designed for you to get comfortable, which is unfortunate.  I would like to see an actual old school pizzeria.  It is clean though and you should order ahead so that you do not need to wait.   The service was friendly and quick.  I will say the inside did smell like fried chicken (good fried chicken) and not pizza, but don't let that put you off.

So we ordered their Clevelander.  Being new to Ohio, I had to check it out.  Very well done.  The crust looks like a pie, but it is not deep dish, but it is loaded with cheese and toppings.  We also got a free order of their garlic twists/bread (Yelp check in bonus).  The twists are their crust and they are okay.  For free, they were awesome.

So I will be back, and I may even try the Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"We decided to try Zeppe's to support a local business rather than the national chains, and I can say that I'm glad we did.  It's not gourmet, but I liked it better than Domino's, Hungry Howie's or Papa John's.  

I couldn't give it a higher rating for a couple of reasons.  For one, the service was not great, even for a takeout pizza place.  Just to clarify, there is no seating at this location, only takeout.  There was an older gentleman in the back doing the baking who knew what he was doing, and he often had to come up to help the clueless teenagers up front.  I presume that's why we got home one time to find that he had forgotten to put sauce on one of our pizzas.  I could have called and complained and I have no doubt that they would have made us another pie with no problem, but I actually ended up liking it - It was like a giant black olive-studded cheesy bread.  

Zeppe's unique twist on pizza is their fluted crust, which makes for an interesting change from the usual - slightly crispy on the edges but still substantial and chewy in the center.  I've begun to make my own pizza and have gotten used to a totally dry, stonebaked crust, so the greasy pan-style crust was jarring to me, but may not be to others.  They are generous with the cheese and not too overbearing on the sauce, which is just how I like it.  

Overall, it's better than you'd get from the other chains and supports a local business which seems quite dedicated to the community, so worth a try on your next I'm-too-lazy-to-cook night."}
{"text":"We had traveled all night and were tired and hungry so we called for pizza to have it delivered to the hotel. They had a lot of different options for pizza. We decided on the calzones we got the sausage and pepperoni calzone and the zeppe's calzone. They were huge and so filled with ingredients. They were so cheesy and delicious! We tried some boneless wings with the wild BBQ sauce and they had just the perfect amount of spice that wake your taste buds up! They were a ways away from the hotel, but got there quite quickly and brought it right up to the room. I have my hometown favorites with pizza, but this is definitely up there and I would recommend it to anyone that is in the area!"}
{"text":"Had a party for my kids and these guys were great in getting a pizza made for us fast at the right price.

Great slices...I can tell, cuz the kids ate it all :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza was overall good, sauce excellent as well as crispy crust. Cheese a little over cooked. Main reason for poor rating is inhospitable staff. Needed to use the restroom, informed that we could walk across (25* F) street and go to gas station. Turned out gas station also declined. Did not think it was legal to have dine in facilities and not provide patrons reasonable access to facilities. Plenty of good options for pizza, would avoid Zeppe's unless you have unusually strong bladder and don't mind proving it!"}
{"text":"Holy Cleveland, the antipasto salad is huge! Pizza slices waiting for you. The pizza is delicious. Tower City location is great. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this takeout pizza.  The pepperoni is flavorful and spicy.  I also got a pizza bianco, which is a nice change from usual pizzas.  (Especially if you're huge on cheese and not a fan of tomato sauce.)  They weren't only tasty: They were also really great looking pizzas.  They put a lot of care into making my order. 

The staff was great to chat with too. I'll definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"in a word .. YUCK 

I have come to not expect much from chains but in the past I have found Zeppe's better than the others in the area .. Marco's .. or Domino's .. or Papa Johns .. won't be making that mistake again 

my favorite in the area is Loparo's but they are closed currently due to vandalism .. tied for 2nd is both Vicinato's + Pizzaz .. but neither delivers .. so Zeppe's became our choice by default & also due to delivery 

what arrived at our door was not fit for a dog to eat .. got pepperoni w/extra cheese + green peppers .. what arrived was a soggy tasteless & near cold mess of a pizza .. quite certain there was no extra cheese, the pepperoni was dried out, the green pepper was nearly non existant but after only a couple bites what remained ended up in the garbage where it belonged & we got dressed & went to Vicinato's .. so much for a quiet & lazy Friday nite (10-16-15) at home w/food brought to our door 

we also got BBQ wings & they were average at best .. 

called twice to complain but were put on hold both times for over 10 minutes & eventually the call dropped .. was not worth a 3rd call 

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the area.  Not greasy!  The crust is heavy and the sauce is not too sweet or acidic.  You can order online, too.  The employees were friendly and helpful.  The subs and other items, like the fried mozzarella, are always fresh and hot.  
The last time I had Zeppe's was in 1999 in Parma Heights...I loved it.  I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted as I remembered it when I had it the other week."}
{"text":"I just want to say how clean and fresh the pizzeria looked and yes the pizza is great!!"}
