{"text":"Awesome spot for good quality drinks! Their menu is really original, the service is friendly and welcoming! Would definitely recommend it for people looking for a trendy yet classy joint for after work cocktails. Try out the \"goose\" ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Excellent service. Everything that came out of the kitchen was amazing.  We had a group of 7 guys and we all agree. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Beef tartare arrived and it was grey. They were helpful in replacing it which is why I am giving it 2 stars. The inside is a bit like a club but I wouldn't say a very good club. Overall it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Recently attended a Yelp event here, and had a good time.  The modern design of this place, particularly the hexagonal lights is really cool and makes me want to spend time here. The music was cool too, a bit loud, but electronica, which always gets my approval.   I mean these days, they could have been playing that mumble rap nonsense, thank goodness they weren't.   I don't know if they always have a DJ, but they did for the event, I liked that.  Their cocktails are nice and strong, which I think is important, I'm sure there are fancy shmancy places out there getting away with expensive watered down drinks... That isn't the case here.  The food was tasty, I loved their salmon tataki, and enjoyed their bean burger also. I'm not really sold on the idea of eating here, though. It's a pretty narrow space, fine for drinks, but I'd go somewhere else to eat afterwards.  That said, I'd definitely bring friends from out of town here, it's a fun place."}
{"text":"First off the decor was beautiful! The menu design was great and there was the perfect amount of variety for food & drinks. The staff was extremely friendly & accommodating. It began raining and we were promptly relocated to the inside.   Our server was VERY knowledgeable and gave the perfect recommendations. Mind you, he mentioned he just started and you would never tell. Please try the signature drinks! They were SO GOOD! I had the MC^2 and it was phenomenal. We had their tacos as well, so good! They honestly put so much thought into everything you're consuming. Every element has a purpose and your mouth will enjoy the experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fancy place and great service. Food was also tasty but a tad expensive and the waiter was awesome. Apparently it was his first time but that was a flawless experience. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I always feel bad giving a low star rating but Kemestre Bar Gourmet fell flat last night.  We were a group of 6 and were seated near the window. The venue itself is very modern, with neon lights throughout, and club music on speakerphone; it would make for a great space especially at night for drinks but the plasma tv screens playing TSN all over the walls kind of cheapens the mood.   Our waiter was exceptional; engaging and knowledgeable but the kitchen had issues which ruined the experience and hence the service.  I was excited to try the food as the menu was developed by Joe Mercuri and have enjoyed the food at his signature restaurant. Our group of 6 started with the some cocktails. They have classic cocktails but also a house specialities menu; as I like rum, the waiter recommended a rum based drink named \"Bones and Dust\" and he was right on! Drinks all around were liked by all.   Then came the food. I started with the tuna tataki; it was good but lacked flavour although I enjoyed the texture and presentation. For the mains, we all opted for different plates including tartare, fish, ribs, burgers, and I ordered the pork bao buns. Our weren't served at the same time, so by the time some of us were almost down, half of us didn't have our meals yet. The kitchen made a mistake with two of our orders, once sending the wrong burger, and I got the wrong side dish for my plate. No worries! The restaurant was busy and is still in a learning curve so I don't sweat the little things if the food is good. Unfortunately, besides my friend's New York Strip steak, none of us really enjoyed our meals. The portions aren't as generous as I'd imagine for the price but most importantly, the dishes are lacklustre. My pork buns were all \"crispy\" bread and not enough filling, and at that, didn't taste like much. Left me wondering \"where's the meat\"?   We decided to skip dessert mostly because after our plates were cleared, we were \"forgotten\" and had to flag down the staff for our bills.   Unfortunately, I'm giving this resto a low score for lack of coordination in the kitchen, the less than okay food, and weird \"clubby\" sports bar vibe."}
{"text":"The first time I was here was for a Yelp event, and because I donated to a charity that was present there last night, I received a lunch token to come back. The restaurant is nicely decorated with fun chemistry concept. The staff is nice and friendly.   When I came back for lunch, I sat on the terrace. It was a nice sunny day. The waiter/bartender was nice & helpful though a little distracted at times. I took a cocktail & the Clean Eating plate which was grilled chicken breast and roasted veggies. The cocktail was good, the food was not bad but nothing to get excited about. The price is on the expensive side for what it was.  I would come back here for drinks."}
