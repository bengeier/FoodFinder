{"text":"Been here a few times, and am usually happy with the food, service and atmosphere. The rolls are not very special, just average, although the presentation is very nice. The tempura was very good, particularly the lobster tempura - very reasonably priced too. They also have monkfish liver sushi, which I always appreciate; good portion and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Went in not expecting much; the decor is kind of typical Japanese. So when they brought out elegant dishes of great modern Japanese food I was impressed.

We started with a Kaiso Salad and Sushi Pizza. Both were good. The Sushi Pizza was a tad oily, but I think I'm saying that only to criticize something.

For rolls, we had the Sky Dome and the Volcano Roll, which looked like an erupted volcano on the plate -- covered with the minced tuna/yam filling. The Sky Dome roll was a really nice mix of sweet and savory with tempura'd shrimp and japanese pickles. 

The portions of everything were pretty generous and were great at decorating dishes, which I'm curious to see if they can keep up as it gets busier.

Best part about the night: the staff uniform is miniskirts!
(Really, who wears miniskirts?)"}
{"text":"Have nothing negative to say after a visit for lunch last week.

We were a group of 7 and came in with a reservation at noon. We were seated immediately, the table had been prepared despite the reservation being made only an hour prior.

Although I love nigiri and maki, I took the recommendation of a colleague and had the chicken teriyaki lunch special. For 8.95 this is a great deal for lunch. It comes with miso soup and a green salad, rice, a few tempura fish pieces topped with a delicious hot sauce, pickled vegetables and of course the chicken teriyaki. The teriyaki sauce was deliciously sweet and savoury, and it sat on top of some cabbage which added a nice crunch. Highly recommend it. 

Great value! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in one week. Great service and very tasty sushi. We had a variety of rolls -- nothing too adventurous -- dynamite, fire roll, the yellow tail roll with green onion -- all of it beautifully presented and extremely tasty and in a nice relaxing surrounding ...in the heart of Toronto on Queen West ...we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family (of 4) the food was amazing!! The service was also amazing. It took a while for the first order to come but after that everything else came very fast!! We went when it was dinner and right when they opened so it wasnt busy... however, it can get busy after!! Nothing to complain about the food.. it was very fresh and made very pretty lol The prices was a little high though but well worth it!"}
{"text":"First glance the atmosphere is nice and clean. Staff took a little long to come take our order. Asked for the spicy scallop roll and said brown rice, which they add $1.50 for brown rice -no problem, but I had an issue when I asked them no tempura bits on my roll and they said that's an additional $1 to not add it !? Very strange... The food is good quality and the presentation is very nice. I would not come back but it was nice to try it out if your in the area"}
{"text":"I really love To-Ne! I know I love it because I've eaten at many different sushi restaurants and so far only To-Ne has gotten me on lockdown and wanting me to go back for more. The sashimi here is melt in your mouth fresh and served in large cut sizes! (some places are just super stingy). When prepping dishes, they like to showcase their amazing presentation skills with flower arrangements and sauce designs which makes eating very enjoyable to the eyes. It's purely an unpretentious restaurant with fantastic food for a reasonable price. The service is excellent, and everything I've tried so far was delicious: seaweed salad, salmon pizza, sashimi boat, tempura app. I've only been here once but will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"I went to here with my family today at 2pm?maybe..! Store's mood was great, because it didn't like Japanese but like refined restaurant. I ate special order that consist of salmon, tuna, crap and so on. When they came in my mouth, it was swimming!!"}
{"text":"Budget sushi pretender - avoid! 

I've been to To-Ne a few times in the past and enjoyed what used to be well priced, well plated sushi at a good price. Really awful service this time. From rudeness, to server's language barrier, soups and appetizers being brought after main dishes, rushed service... the list goes on. Way to ruin what was a decent option for sushi in downtown.

I called ahead to make sure they were open and to reserve a table. Our server was rushed and didn't seem to understand our order or questions about the food (there was a language barrier). One person had a food preference and the server couldn't tell her if the dish contained the ingredient. He said he'd go check, but we never heard back.

The Kalbi Beef Rib dish was the standout good dish. The Dragon Roll has gone downhill - smaller, not put together or plated well, taste/ingredients were lacking. The tuna sashimi was alright, but was poorly plated. The Yaki Soba was not worth ordering."}
{"text":"Not overly fond of this place. Perhaps it was an off day, but nothing I had tasted was fresh at all, the fish just tasted off to me. I didn't even have the luxury of any sort of dressing on my salad. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! I have tried other places downtown Toronto and this one is my favourite! I recommend it if you are downtown Toronto. I love the fire roll."}
{"text":"Definitely not my new neighborhood sushi spot. Came in, tricked by all the 4 & 5 star reviews, for a quick lunch. 

Can't say I've ever been fed whole faux-crab stick in a hand roll before. Insult to injury, it was the most anemic & flimsy hand roll I've ever been handed."}
{"text":"The sushi was tasty and well served. Really nice plating - makes it feel more upscale than many other places in the city. The service was soooooo slow at times. Particularly when we were trying to order. A bunch of tables had just left and they spent the time cleaning them off instead of serving us! The service, when they were in fact serving us, was very polite. I would be willing to give them a second try for sure!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in the Queen and Spadina area. Always greeted with a smile and \"hello!\" from the staff.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. One server in a packed restaurant. They forgot my order, walked out after 30 mins."}
{"text":"After reading a plethora of mixed reviews, my friend and I took a chance and entered to-ne sushi. We were taken aback by the crusty restaurant and grimy surfaces, but entered based on all the positive reviews we read online. Clearly we were swindled and pimped. The waiter sat us at a table, but then walked away without giving us any menus. We then proceeded to wait 15 minutes without any menus or water, while we attempted to catch the waiters attention. After the longest 15 minutes of my life, the waiter returned with menus. We attempted to order the lunch special, but he refused saying it had ended 5 minutes ago, which was long after we arrived. No wonder he held off on giving us the menus. Being famished and angry, we contemplated leaving, but ordered anyways out of our pure desperation for food. Clearly that was our biggest mistake, it only went downhill from there. It was literally the worst meal of my life. The nasty, dusty, plastic flowers on my friends food didn't make it any more appetizing. The seaweed was very gross as well. Keep in mind this was the first time I have ever tipped 0%. The only possibility for all these positive reviews is that the owner sits and writes them all, instead of actually running the restaurant. I could go on, but all you need to know is just to keep walking... and never look back in to-ne's direction. You will thank me one day."}
{"text":"My husband and I met our dear friends (another couple) out for dinner. We decided on sushi and I offered to research a new place. After finding To-ne Sushi through the lovely Yelper's reviews, I was confident we wouldn't be disappointed. The 4 of us are quite particular about our sushi and we all absolutely LOVED every dish. Our eyes were bigger then our tummies and ordered a little too much food but I don't think we left a single piece. From the green dragon roll, red dragon roll, crispy avocado maki, spicy tuna and salmon maki etc etc etc (we opt for brown rice) to a wide array of sashimi- every morsel was unbelievably fresh and so tasty! And as others have commented on, the presentation is a really pretty touch. Amazing saki. We arrived without a reservation at 8:30pm and although it was fully packed, with 2 sets of people ahead of us, we waited maybe 10 minutes which for a Saturday, I thought was great! Ideal for couples or a small group (3-8) of friends!"}
{"text":"I visited To-Ne Sushi for the first time several days ago and was very impressed with the freshness of the fish, the presentation of the meal (fresh flowers, lovely Japanese plates) and the overall cozy, clean and pretense free atmosphere. 
  I ordered Ikura and Uni sushi, both very fresh, and my boyfriend and I shared the Caterpillar Roll, Salmon sushi, Spicy Salmon sushi and the Teriyaki chicken: absolutely delicious, absolutely fresh and absolutely worth a repeat visit! Hard-core sushi lovers will appreciate that the ratio of rice to fish in both the maki rolls and sushi was well-balanced: nothing worse than going to eat sushi and ending up eating mouthfuls of rice instead. In addition, after every other restaurant on Queen Street didn't have Uni in stock ( I was craving Uni BIG TIME), this place did: delicious. 
  Our waitress was friendly, polite and prompt, a marked difference from the sour faces and slap-dash attitude served up by many of the staff at the all-you-can-eat restaurants that have cropped up in Toronto. Yes, you can eat all you want, but why would you want to? The service at To-Ne Sushi is a complete contrast to that: you feel welcomed, are served in a timely way and genuine care is put into the presentation of the meal. All this, plus high-quality, tasty food. 
  Note: the bathrooms were clean and well-kept (anyone who has eaten sushi in a restaurant that has sketchy bathroom hygiene must have balls of steel). 
   I am heading to To-Ne Sushi tonight and bringing a friend: this place deserves repeat business and it is definitely getting mine."}
{"text":"I went to To-ne Sushi last month because I was in the neighborhood and the reviews in Yelp were quite good.  It was a big disappointment. We ordered four dishes. The first one arrived 2 mins after we order it. The rest was all on the table within 5 mins. It felt like fast food, not a Japanese restaurant. The quality of the food was average at best.  I guess the location tells all, it's at the corner of Queen and Spadina. The rent must be really high,  so the owner was try to fit in as much customers as possible. It wasn't like the staffs were standing next to the table to rush you, but it certainly felt like the food was not carefully prepared. We finish our dinner and out the door in 40 mins.  I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Mediocre, especially for the price. Staff was inattentive and the sauces for the box sets just felt watery and flat. There are plenty of better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"I ordered take out via Orderit.ca and the process was breezy. Everything was ready on time and the man at the counter was very pleasant. 

I ordered the Red Dragon Roll and was not disappointed. It tasted super fresh and the rolls were an ample size. The low price tag definitely does not reflect the quality of the sushi here (yay!). 

I'll definitely be back to try more soon!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 min to give order.  Server never came back after we were seated. Restaurant was pretty empty so the lack of service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in the downtown core (and I've tried a lot). Dine-in if you can as presentation is just lovely and the service is fantastic.
I've tried quite a few items and would recommend the Agedashi Tofu, Salmon three ways lunch special and the seared Tuna salad. Let them know if there's a birthday and they'll serenade you!
Meal always ends with very delicately cut fruit (either melon or orange) for the whole table. 
Price is pretty average for sushi."}
{"text":"***** 5 stars for food
*1 star for service

You come here for food not the service.
The portions are generous. The flavour is spot on.  I had the Spicy Maki special composed of 6 pieces of spicy salmon maki and 6 pieces of spicy tuna maki topped off with 8 pieces of the spicy dynamite maki. $20.50. Comes with miso soup and salad."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to sushi joint in the downtown area. Very reasonable priced and good quality.

The sashimi is always fresh and the sushi rolls are unique / very tasty. Now this with some sake and Sapporo, makes a fine meal!

If you order enough food, try asking them to put it on a boat....presentation is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Awesome sushi and pretty plating decorations .  I like the little added touch with spicy mayo and eel sauce drizzled on the plate.  It saves me from asking for extra side of spicy mayo.

Korean owned.  Friendly and good service.  The fish to rice ratio is great.  You get more interior goods and a thin rice layer.  The rolls are nicely packed in and I've never had them fall apart.  Other sushi places have way too much rice in their rolls.  

You can't go wrong with any of the fusion rolls but I love Toronto, Volcano, and Black Dragon.  

I've dined in and ordered take out.  It's great if you wanted to stay in, my bf and I will order then pick up a movie from Queen Video."}
{"text":"I come here about twice a month for lunch. The seafood salad is always fresh, and the  presentation of the rolls is top notch. Service can be a bit slow during lunch but they don't seem to have many servers on."}
{"text":"Quick review specifically on the Yaki Soba noodles. Simply in comparison to others I've tried, these were not great. Totally edible but it was a little greasy tasting and the noodles are very thin - not the thick noodles I'm used to. It almost felt like I was eating a chinese food dish.

I've been for proper sushi lunches here before and the sushi is fine - a 3 star rating.

It wouldn't be my first choice, but since it's close to work and not too expensive, I wouldn't rule it out as an option."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi restaurant in Toronto that I would consider to be a candidate or the best sushi in Toronto. If you haven't checked them out before, do yourself a favor and pay them a visit :-)....

Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Scallop, Toronto Roll, Philadelphia Roll, Caterpillar Rolls....are just some of the tasty sushi rolls that I would recommend. 

Writing this review has just made me very hungry :-)"}
{"text":"This place is bang on for fresh take out sushi, etc.  Usually the stuff are attentive and friendly however today we encountered a waiter who insisted on seating us at the worst tables. Even though the restaurant was half empty at 4pm, the waiter kept on making excuses on how we couldn't be seated at any of the other available tables. It was rather upsetting to see how the actions of one staff could ruin a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Food - easily 5 stars.  The sashimi was fresh and the fish to rice ratio was high in the sushi rolls.  I will definitely come back for the food

Service - horrible. I will try to be as concise as possible:
1) I asked for water as soon as I sat down and it was delivered until half through my entree was served
2) I was never asked if \"everything was okay\".  I had to call over a waitress to remind her I had ordered a glass of water.  
3) After finishing my meal I asked for a refill of water (parched from the soya sauce) and the bill, as well as the debit machine to speed things along.  I was one of the last two remaining tables before the restaurant closed.  The water was promptly delivered (thank you) but the waitress continued to wipe down all the dirty tables and set up for the following day.  After a couple minutes of this I, for the first time, was able to lock eyes with the waitress without having to call her over, to which she responded \"just a minute\" and proceeded to set the tables up for the following day for the next 5 minutes before bringing me to bill.  It was painfully awkward to watch her run around the restaurant wiping tables down while I'm clenching my teeth doing the \"if I stare harder she allow me to pay and leave instead of watching this charade\" 

Will I return? Yes because the food is amazing.  However, I will not go out of my way to change the 15% gratuity to 18-20%."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places in the area for sushi, it's some of the freshest sushi I've found in Toronto.  The rolls are not mostly rice either.  It's just good sushi with decent service in an area which seems to be suffering from a lack of either."}
{"text":"Great service, always delicious food! Would definitely recommend this as one of my favorite sushi spots in Toronto. 
I've taken a lot of different groups of friends there and have never heard anything negative. Their service is great and presentation is levels above most sushi places in the area. Their complimentary house soup is also delicious."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading the previous reviews and perhaps my experience would have been better if I'd dined in.  In hindsight, I should have just made the 10 min walk over but I was lazy and it was cold so I ordered online for delivery and it took over 1.5 hrs to arrive from the time I had placed my order and while the food was generally alright, the avocado in my Legend Roll wasn't nearly ripe enough. Also, the prices seem a bit high relative to other sushi places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful--from the atmosphere to the sushi master wearing a suit under his white smock to the fruit and veg sculptures they put on your plate. It's the first place I ever ate in Toronto and I knew I was in a city where I would find great food. It is a bit more expensive but worth it. It's Japanese owners and the staff are super friendly. Never eaten anything here that wasn't good. Order the sunshine roll and try to get a peek at the sushi master using his torch  to caramelize the top!"}
{"text":"We came here on a business dinner, and were quite pleased. We got a couple boats of sushi and sashimi as well as some sake.

All in all, the sushi was excellent, particularly the o-toro, which they had on special last night."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. For starters we didn't get seated till we approached the host. Secondly took 35 mins for our food and this was only after we asked the waiter what was going on with our order. We noticed everyone arriving after us being served and thought maybe our sushi rolls just took a while to make. Turns out that our sushi was sitting on the sushi  counter for atleast 25 mins which by then got really cold and not so pleasant to eat. Food was alright service was horrible."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent. The staff is very nice & helpful. The décor could use a refresh. One tip: don't order the seafood udon soup dish; the broth was very lackluster and it was a struggle to finish the dish as a result!"}
{"text":"So maybe this isn't the best sushi place in town but  it's probably the best one I've tried within a 10 minute walk from my place.
I ordered the fire roll and the dynamite roll. The ingredients tasted fresh, with good sized chunks of avocado and not too much rice.  My only gripe is that to get spicy mayo on the side is a $1 surcharge.  I haven't been charged extra for spicy mayo at other restaurants and the small side of it they provide probably costs them pennies. I don't like restaurants that nickel and dime customers for things like that (-1 star for that).
The BF said that that salmon and tuna he had was good - typical of other places.
Given our limited sushi options I would come back here if I were too lazy to walk further or drive somewhere else to satisfy my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. Excellent sushi with tons of stuff inside in the roll and very little rice on the outside, they don't skimp! A bit more expensive than other places, so minus 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a high rating to be honest.  I ended up here last night with three friends because Aji Sai across the street was packed.  No one in our group had been here before so we didn't know what to expect.

I should mention that I normally don't write reviews online (good or bad), but I was so dissatisfied with my experience here that I had to share.

First, it took way too long for someone to come take our order.  We ordered a shrimp tempura starter, salmon sushi pizza, spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, kamikaze roll, and an a la carte order of salmon sushi (2 pcs), tuna sushi (2 pcs), and salmon sashimi (3 pcs).  We ordered tea and water for the table.  Starter came out quickly with our tea and a small complimentary bowl of their crunchy noodle soup.  Shrimp tempura was great and the soup was delicious.

Sushi pizza came out after and it was kind of bland.  Had to ask for the water we had ordered a couple more times at this point before it was finally delivered.

Took a while for the rest of the meal to come out.  When it finally did, we noticed the presentation was quite lovely but would have gladly gone without if it meant that it would have been served faster.  Again, food was mediocre, which I would have likely overlooked if the service wasn't so terrible.  

As soon as we got our main course, it seems as though our waitress completely checked out.  She never came to check on us once. Our drinks ran empty and were never refilled, and we didn't see her again until she came to process the payment for a neighbouring table, at which point we had already finished our meal.  I contemplated ordering ice cream for dessert but given how long it took to get served, I decided against it.

After waiting about 15 minutes for our waitress to surface again so we could ask for the bill, she came out from the back kitchen and started making her way towards us but we quickly realized that she was actually making a beeline for the woman who had just delivered her Starbucks order before she disappeared back into the kitchen.  I had to get up and go to the cash register at the back to ask a different waitress to bring us our bill.  Once we got the bill, we had wait another 15 minutes before I got so fed up that I just brought the bill back to the register to have the payment processed.  I know for a fact that they are able to bring a mobile terminal to the table to process the payment, and I don't mean to sound lazy but given that we received such terrible service throughout the whole dinner, this was just the icing on the cake.  We were trying to pay them for the dinner, yet no one could even be bothered to attend to us!

Our waitress never surfaced again after she got her coffee, until we were putting on our coats to leave.  As we were leaving, I noticed another table in our area with a couple who just kept looking towards the back kitchen - probably wondering when someone was going to come take their order.

If you are looking for a mediocre meal with slow service, then I recommend this place.  Otherwise, I'm sure you would have a better meal at one of the many other sushi restaurants within walking distance of this place."}
{"text":"I picked up a takeout order last Saturday (April 2nd, 2016) at around 7:30PM and had to find out that the soup spilled all over the other containers and that the rolls exploded. It was a mess and I lost appetite. My boyfriend said the food was mediocre. They also forgot to put soy sauce and chopsticks. The old lady who helped with the transaction was aloof - not very customer-oriented. I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for pointing me in this direction. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have tried this place. The high rating made me curious. We're not sushi connoisseurs but we certainly can tell what's good. 

I tend to rate sushi places based on the uni -- the sea urchin that's usually marked 'challenging' on the beer menu mats. The portion was a bit small, which is fine, as any more would have been wasted by trying to stuff the whole thing in my mouth. The uni tasted fresh and flavourful. We also had an interesting unagi roll which we have not seen at other sushi places, and the complementary soup was not standard fare miso. Other than that, nothing unique, but again, that's cool with us. We're not impressed by inflated ego sushi that usually comes with inflated prices. 

So.... really good sushi, reasonable prices and friendly service add up to 5 stars for the kind of place it is."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant often but for tonight they had the worst service. Their sushi is fresh and tasty but the minute we were seated, we didn't get menus. They didn't take our order for a while, forgot our drink orders and didn't even give us our bill when we asked for it. We basically self-served except for the sushi. The sushi was the hero of the night. Fresh and so good. I think we'll just get take-out."}
{"text":"I've frequented To-ne going on 3 years now without any complaints...until last week.  Came here at 2ish on a Saturday as part of an occasional post-workout tradition with a friend.  There were only 3 other occupied tables and several servers standing around - the trouble began after we were seated.  

It started with the server being in a noticeable rush for us to order (he came back twice in the span of 2 mins to ask if we were ready) - even though the place was virtually empty.  Then, when we did order he repeated everything incorrectly, which left me having to then repeat our order several times.  It started to sound like that \"And Then\" part from Dude, Where's My Car? - which is odd since his English seemed fine.  

Aaaaaand Thennnn when the food showed up we ended up with the wrong orders anyway!  Luckily, he got my chirashi order right, as that's my fave item on the menu (and one of the best I've had at any lower-end sushi joint in this city).  

To add insult to injury, it took over 15 minutes for him to bring us the bill.  At one point we even had a stare down, but he STILL did nothing.  I should add that he wasn't serving anyone else by that time either. 

I'm really hoping our server was just having an 'off day' because I legit love this place.  In my experience, the fish has always been fresh and served beautifully and promptly.  However, after this last experience, and with so many sushi joints in this area, I'm not sure if there will be an 'And Then' for To-ne and me."}
{"text":"From the outside there definitely isn't much to look at but on the inside it's actually decent. Was definitely reluctant to eat there originally just because bad sushi can be downright disgusting. Came in and was greeted by a server and brought to a table. After looking around was somewhat comforted by the nice atmosphere where I thought I was in a good hands, this is where things started to go downhill. After being seated we were basically left there with no water and no menus for at least 10 minutes, if I'm being kind, until we finally were finally able to wave down a server and even had to ASK them for the menus. We were then finally given water and placed our orders. The food came relatively fast and the presentation was quite nice. The food was their redeeming quality as the sashimi tasted fresh and the sushi had a good fish-to-rice ratio, in which most sushi restaurants tend to overdo the rice. Just when I thought their service couldn't get any worse, it just goes and gets worse. Before I even finished my meal, a server walked by and took my plate without asking me whether I was finished. After when it came time to leave and asked for our bill, another server came by and started serving us food when the order was meant for the neighbouring table. Since there isn't a specific server for a section, servers seem clueless and it really reflect in their service. Come for the food but the service definitely isn't the best."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service wasn't so excellent. We made reservations for a large group for a birthday party. The reservation was made for 8:45pm on a Wednesday night. It wasn't particularly busy that night. But for some reason they made our group stand outside and at the door until 9:45pm. I felt like organizing the empty tables and chairs myself. An hour wait after making a reservation a month ahead on a weeknight that's not busy was very unpleasant. During our meal, we struggled to order as we could not get the staff's attention. During the meal, we needed water, through the evening, 4 of us, got up individually, walked to the kitchen/cash entrance area and asked the waiters standing there to bring us some water. We also inquired about it at our table about 12 times. The water NEVER came. I had to go to a convenience store to get a drink right after. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Came here about 4 times and they are great with groups as well! Everything is always super fresh, and the staff are super accommodating and nice. A little bit on the pricier side, but would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place. The place was clean, the employees was helpful and the food came out fast. We all loved sushi and rolls that was really fresh and grate. They have some very interesting rolls with special sauce which are tornado and rocky mountain roll. So you must try that. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after work with several coworkers. One person ordered for us all so I don't really know what was ordered, but it was plated beautifully and it tasted delicious. We also ordered tempura. The shrimp was amazing and the pumpkin tempura was also very tasty. They served us a small bowl of soup and tea to accompany our meal. The wait staff was very attentive and were constantly taking care of our needs. 

Will come again. Food was delicious and the owner made friendly conversation with us once our meal was done, which was nice. It makes for a great group outing. The decor is nice and they have a very casual yet calming ambience in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Just ate out for the 4th time on my own and with my best friend today at to-ne sushi and the food as usual is amazing whenever I visit. Its suits my liking. The servers are very helpful. I would totally recommend anyone that lives around spadina and queen to come eat at this restaurant. Even people who dont live around this area should come here and eat, you would NOT regret at all. I would just eat at this restaurant whenever I feel like eating sushi. The prices for the sushi are good priced and just perfect for my liking!^_^"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant! 

Sushi is super fresh and beautifully decorated. Quality food at a very reasonable price.

I've brought many friends there and they all agree, best sushi ever.

If you've never been - GO!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and very fresh fish. The service isn't anything special and typical for a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a variety of rolls and sashimi on a couple of occasions. Plating was phenomenal and the fresh cuts of fish are appreciated! It will cost you a pretty dime though but not outrageous just yet."}
{"text":"Living out in beautiful British Columbia, where seafood is fresh and good sushi is easy to find, I rarely opt for sushi when visiting my hometown of Toronto.  But when I found myself craving sushi one sunny afternoon in Toronto, I wasn't about to waste my time on bad to mediocre sushi. 

 To-ne sushi is fresh, the presentation is lovely and the rolls were a little on the small side, yet full of flavour.  I didn't mind the size.  It allowed me to eat my spicy scallop roll with grace.  My only complaint was the tempura.  It was almost over-battered and maybe not quite fried all the way through.  I would bite into the crispy end of my shrimp tempura and yet, I could taste and feel the soft, almost soggy, not quite cooked batter.  But I wasn't craving tempura, I was craving sushi, and this place managed to sate my sushi craving quite nicely.  
I ordered the salmon sashimi and tempura combo with a side of spicy scallop roll, which would have been way too much if I wasn't so damn hungry."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the dinner here, and I was starving!  So got a bunch of appetizers as I wanted to try everything.
- deep fried oysters
- sashimi appetizer
- seaweed salad
- black dragon roll (unagi and avocado)

It was all very good and the presentation was pretty.  I really enjoyed the roll as there wasn't too much rice.  The complimentary cup of soup with noodles were quite delicious.  On a cold winter night, though maybe I should have some good hot slurpy noodles.  I watched a kid eating that and was a little envious - oh why can't I have a bigger stomach?!  Oh well, I'll just have to visit again!"}
{"text":"I'm always pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the sushi here. They pay attention to the small details and I love the ground sesame on my roll. The service is always warm and welcoming. I've been a handful of times and will continue to come here time and time again. They are also on ritual which makes it a quick grab and go on my way home. They often give a little soup for you to enjoy while you wait if you didn't order ahead which I think is a nice touch, especially during the colder days."}
{"text":"They have really great rolls here and the servers are super friendly.
Favourite rolls:
All time - kamakaze
Special - Hot summer roll: instead of seaweed this is rolled in cucumber. so refreshing and delicious!

I also appreciate and enjoy the little noddle soup they give you as a complimentary starter. Yum!"}
{"text":"Horrible lunch bentos with sushi pieces the circumference of highlighters and the rice goey, never going back"}
{"text":"This place has DELICIOUS sushi. Like straight up, their maki rolls are excellent! It's so yummy and fresh and I love love their tempura bits in certain rolls. 

Things taste awesomely fresh!! I can't wrap my head around how this place is so great and how the sushi place 2 blocks west (I Love Sushi) is SO awful. Complete different ends of the sushi spectrum, wow."}
{"text":"I dined here with friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The service was great and food was extremely fresh. The meals were also served very quickly, which we were impressed by. I highly recommend this restaurants. Note also that I am a Vegetarian and the options for Vegetarians are extensive."}
{"text":"I came here during a lunch break with some coworkers and they assured me this was the best Japanese restaurant in the area given the alternatives like Aji Sai across the street.

The sushi did not hold together well and the fish did not taste too fresh. I'm no sushi snob, but I've definitely had better. 

Service was spotty - To be fair, this was during the lunch rush, so we weren't paid much attention. 

Overall, there are better places downtown to fix that sushi craving."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST place in the city for sushi rolls! They are always so delicious and made with high quality ingredients. Unlike many other cheaper sushi places, these rolls aren't packed with rice and made haphazardly. They have a true Japanese feel, which is that the sushi must also look beautiful while tasting beautiful. The presentation is lovely and they make a special design (dragon, etc) out of the special sauces (unlike other places that charge $1 just for spicy mayo!). A little pricier than other places in the city, but you definitely get a higher quality roll."}
{"text":"Looking for great sushi and service on Queen Street West, To-ne Sushi is your spot.

I was here this week for the first time for a good-bye lunch and I was impressed with the service and quality of sushi that was served.   

I love their seaweed salad balanced with shredded diakon.  I was already full after eating my salad. The small sushi boat we order was more than enough sushi for the 3 of us. 

Prices were competitive for the other sushi places in the area.

I will definietly be back for future meals in the area."}
{"text":"This is actually the best sushi place I have been to in Ontario. I tried amazing sushi in Vancouver and I have finally found something the same, or even better.

I split 2 lunch specials and it was SO much food that we couldn't finish it all. The price was so good for the high quality rolls. The salmon and avocado in the rolls were large and fresh, and the rolls themselves were perfectly wrapped and did not have a lot of rice in them to overpower what was inside. You could actually taste the sushi and avocado. Each plate came with a little bouquet of cut flowers!

Only place I will actually go for sushi now :)"}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side for what I expected, but normally I go to Aji-Sai across the street, but this time I needed a change for they have gone downhill for me.

Ordered a miso soup and the sunshine roll, which came to $12. Miso was well-balanced and had little mushrooms in it, but I wish it had more tofu. The sunshine roll had avocado, cucumber (I think) and some crispy bits in it, with some warm seared salmon ontop that had a yellow sauce. It was actually very good. 
Service was good.

So although the price seems a little more than I hoped, To-ne receives 4-stars based on the sunshine maki, or else 3.5. I shall return another day : )"}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service. The sashimi was not fresh at all. That's why they put so many lemon slices beside the sashimi, trying to cover the fishy taste. The sushi rice was not cooked properly. It was too dry, too hard and the seasoning wasn't enough. If you check the photos of this place, you'll see most of them are rolls. That's how you know it's a cheap restaurant for unauthentic Japanese food. If you're looking for good Japanese food, go to Japango or Yuzu no Hana. Dining in such a restaurant is a waste of money. I don't recommend of coming to here. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"How can you people call this place a sushi gem?

I came here based on the hit and miss \"great sushi\" reviews, and was sorely disappointed. The price point is correct, don't get me wrong, but here are all the ways they have displeased me:

- Rather rude, surly waitress by the name of Sophie came by but luckily I wasn't stuck with her because Rosa, a sweet girl managed to cheer up the place with her smiles.

- They serve you a beginning appetizer of a soup with tempura flakes (yuck) that looks like miso. I thought it WAS miso soup and drank it, but they do bring you another bowl of REAL miso soup later. Don't be fooled by this soup offering, leave it aside and don't touch it.

- The salad is pretty gross. 

- The sashimi I ate was half frozen. I can forgive \"pretty cold\", but I was biting through ice chunks.

- The decoration on the plate was cheesy and kind of gross. I don't want fake plastic flowers on my plate, it must have been collecting dust for days before coming close to my fish... YUCK.

- They didn't give enough rice (kind of stingy).

I would not come back. Granted, they are Japanese (and speak it), but I would not come back here unless I was in the area and starving with no hope of making it to Japango or Yuzu no Hana.

At the very least, they are better than the crap Chinese-run Japanese restaurants. That gives them an extra star boost."}
{"text":"To be fair... this review is only for the (free) miso and gyoza.  And really, this is for the miso.  It was tasty and came with noodles, so maybe more like a ramen than a typical miso.  The gyoza was decent, freshly made but not overly flavourful. However I tend to judge sushi places by their miso, so I am hoping to get back to try that. I'll keep you posted! 

I did find it odd that they had a saki dispenser, but what do I know about these things?"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in Toronto. Seriously. Great service too, the waitresses are very polite and kind!"}
{"text":"Friendly and speedy service. Food was tasty and prepared with care. Free soup (like ramen) was great and had unique flavors. Seaweed salad (with other vegetables) was tasty and artfully presented. Cucumber rolls were fresh and well seasoned. Miso soup was great too. 

I would definitely return the next time I come to Toronto. Way better than the sushi places closer to University Ave."}
{"text":"Great value for what you get!
I ordered a chicken katsu don and was pleasantly surprised to find that the dish had a nice variety of shredded vegetables and not just the standard egg, chicken and fish combo like other restaurants. There was also a generous serving of rice and it came with salad and miso soup. My friend wasn't even able to finish her bowl of ramen noodles. Nice presentation of everything too - taking a look around the room the flowers that were placed some of the sushi rolls added a nice touch and the sushi boats looked quite decadent for the price - would love to try that someday!

We were seated promptly, staff was kind and the service/atmosphere was great. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Decent rolls, but the nori quality is a bit low. All the rolls we ordered were freshly prepared, which is key for a good dynamite roll, etc. 

We would come back, but not in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Sure, it seems like another run-of-the-mill-borderline-fast-food-sushi-joint but To-ne doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the Hosu's and Ichibans.
I've been here a few times and I mostly come for the shiitake sushi pizza. It's not often that vegetarians get treated to a sushi pizza (props to Sushi Queen for being another restaurant that's considerate towards the vegheads out there). The one at To-ne has a nice, flavourful, crispy rice base. On top, they don't skimp on the shiitake mushrooms. Some spicy mayo is thrown into the mix to make a nice treat for my salivating mouth.
The last time I came here, there was 20 minutes to spare before closing time. I felt guilty for placing a takeout order so close to the wire, especially because it looked like they had cleaned the sushi counters for the evening but they were more than cordial. They even offered me a small bowl of noodle soup as a free appetizer while I waited for my order! As best as my recollection goes, the sushi is pretty decent. They've got a good selection of vegetarian rolls but it's the sushi pizza that I always go for!"}
{"text":"This place is great! More upscale than your hole on the wall! The presentation of the sushi is absolutely lovely!! The sushi it self tastes as great as the presentation! 

A bit pricier than an average sushi place, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and usually have a great experience. The past couple of times the service has been pretty slow as they were training new staff. Besides the service these past few times I really enjoy coming here. We have now made To-ne our go to place on Queen West for dinner. 

The arrangements on the plates are fantastic and you can tell that extra care and time is put into their sushi making and plating. Their sushi pieces are the perfect size!  The sushi always tastes fresh and I have always enjoyed everything I've ordered. 

Hopefully their customer service will improve so I can give this place full stars!"}
{"text":"Had the Tuna and Salmon sushi/sashimi combo and it was a delightful little lunch from beginning to end. The Noodle miso was a nice little surprise with still crunchy bits of tempura. Salmon and tuna were both buttery and delicious.

My platter arrived with a little flower vase on it and after my lunch they brought out a half an orange portioned with a toothpick!

Decent value and great hospitality!

I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"I came in the area mainly for butter avenue  to treat my sister for her birthday and came across this small sushi restaurant through Yelp. The staffs were friendly, quick with an environment that is clean overall and decently quiet. The food tasted fresh and I was impressed with the creative display and arrangement of the food. I would say, only downfall is that the price is a tad pricey. Rather go to an AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to have dinner at To-ne sushi. The restaurant has a very spacious atmosphere and the menu covers pretty much most of the standard Japanese food. There isn't any particular special item and therefore I selected the most traditional dish for dinner - Beef Donburi.

Beef Donburi was good and the portion was appropriate. The restaurant served two bowls of soup - one is a miso soup, and the other I believe is extra (probably extra soup base for udon). 

However, to my surprise, is the birthday celebration. On the same night, the waiter brought out a cake to celebrate a customer's birthday. The restaurant turned off the lights and played loud music of \"Happy Birthday\". It was a good laugh and the rest of the customers went along with it."}
{"text":"Great value sushi. 

This used to be one of the best sushi places in Toronto. It's still one of my go to places when I'm looking for some quality sushi and reasonable prices. Love the sashimi, nigiri and hwae dup bap. We also love ordering the sushi and sashimi boats, that are always presented beautifully with very fresh fish.

The extra fixin's they compliment with most dishes include a miso soup, noodle soup, orange and ginger salad, and orange slices are nice touches.

We don't frequent this place as often as the secrets out and during busy prime time hours, service can get a little shoddy. The service is generally above average, but given the demand for this place it can get a little hectic in the dining room on Friday and Saturday nights when the crowds are roaring."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto IMHO. Beautifully plated with care and pride. Outstandingly fresh and tasty. Michelle (owner) is a doll. My  all time fav sushi place. And the crunch soup (which is free btw) is so addictive"}
{"text":"So I've only been here twice on very rare occasions but my last visit will definitely be my last. I ordered a sashimi and sushi combination that comes with tuna and salmon, as well as Ikayaki (grilled squid). The presentation of the food was very nice, but while I was eating my sashimi, I almost choked on not one or two, but three pieces of fish bone! In sashimi! Needless to say, I did not finish the rest of the sushi on the plate. My ikayaki came but it was overcooked and very chewy. I've had way better ikayaki somewhere else. 

It was time to ask for the bill and even though they were a little busy, it took me almost 25 minutes to finally get the bill! I would call over a waitress but they would hold up their hand and walk away! When I tried to flag down another waitress, same thing. Then they would go up to other customers that didn't even flag them down to ask how they were doing. 

Unfortunately, this will be my last time going to this location."}
{"text":"Great family-run Sushi joint. Your basic type of sushi place, not fancy.
They have a nice green salad with citrus/orange dressing that is super tasty."}
{"text":"A hot bubbling pot of Nabeyaki Udon really hit the spot on a cold windy nite. Soup was pretty tasty, udon was done just right and prices were very reasonable. 
Good, solid choice for lunch or dinner on QSW"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, great prices and friendly service. It was fast too! We had a spicy tuna roll, the tornado roll (not for those afraid of spice) and a special roll that used cucumber in place of seaweed. All were fresh and delicious. I would definitely return to To Ne."}
{"text":"I have been living in Toronto for 2 years now and I am a sushi addict, every month I need to eat sushi at least once or twice. Long story short, I ve been around the block looking for a good, affordable and flavorful suahi place. To-ne has all the ingredients for being one of he best place in toronto for affordable sushi. My husband and I eat around 25 pieces each and every time we eat there we leave totally full. The place is great, service is fast and above all the price is right..."}
{"text":"This is a Korean-Japanese restaurant.  While the food isn't bad, the portions are really small.  I think the pictures were zoomed in at least 2-3 times, because the bento box was the smallest I had ever seen.  I think the bento boxes are between 14.99 - 19.99, but unless you're a really small eater, you will need to order something else.

I was still hungry at the end.  
Also the service was quite slow, and just to get more tea or even the bill was quite a chore.  
Will not come back.

I just find very few restaurants in Toronto do Japanese food justice.  If you go anywhere in California, the food and presentation is so much better."}
{"text":"Before I discovered Japango, this was one of my favourite sushi places in the city! It's cheaper than the higher end places and you still get GREAT food! They have a big selection of your standard maki rolls and signature rolls as well as a bunch of dinner combos to choose from. If you want the freshest of the freshest sashimi, be willing to pay a bit more and go elsewhere. But for all the other sushi and rolls, this place is great! 

I love their miso soup that comes with tempura bits and noodles! Once I've had it serve to me with my dinner combo and another time I had to order it separately...so you might have to ask about it. BUT it is a miso soup life changer! 

The location is great after a day of shopping and wandering out on Queen West and it's really close to the new Kekou gelato place now too (also another one of my favs!)."}
{"text":"Me likey sushi beardy much! It's okay - I'm Asian.

Another Yelp recommendation, which never fails. Pretty good sushi and they have been keeping up their standards on every one of my visits. I have had great sushi and this place would not come close but the food is definitely worth the price. I always seem to get the Roll Set 1 - which comes with 8 dynaminte rolls, 6 california rolls, and tempera.and the wife gets the veggie udon. I hate to admit it but the veggie udon in pretty tasty.


The service has it's ups and downs but never to the point where it made my experience unenjoyable. 3 stars. I'd come back here every time."}
{"text":"Service/ambiance - excellent, prompt and friendly service. Super nice (possibly owner) lady at the counter who rang us out. She was ADORABLE - she was oohing and aahing over my green hair and asked if she could touch it, in a cute not creepy way. I of course said yes - getting petted by strangers is a hobby of mine. Wait...that didn't come out right. The restaurant itself was cute and very clean, with a very modern simplicity fused with Japanese classic design elements. Again, typical TO downstairs bathrooms. Clean and decent. 

Food - The miso and separate complimentary noodle soups before the meal were excellent - satisfyingly complex broths but not overly salty. Noodles were firm and tasty. My date's mini-salad, which came with his meal, featured very fresh lettuce and a tangy, delicious house dressing. The dragon and spider rolls were on the high end of average - tasty, decently fresh and much fatter than I was used to, but nothing that blew my socks off. The sashimi unagi (eel) was the best I've had, hands down. Very fresh, with a mildly sweet flavor and delicate texture. My seafood-hating bf even tried a bite and had to give it props.  My date's chicken teriyaki ranked as \"the best I've ever had\" in his book. It was in a light but very flavorful sauce, with visible char marks from the grill on the meat. Medium portion of meat with ample, seasoned rice and he had trouble finishing it. It was great to see the sushi chefs in a public space (with glass barrier of course) working on the items and all the ingredients they had out looked very fresh. 

Totally hit the spot, reasonably priced, great staff, comfy space, but doesn't reinvent the wheel."}
{"text":"I usually just get take out from here but dined in last last and had a great experience. 

Friendly service, seating isn't cramped, and the food presentation was pretty good. 

Affordable prices for the quality and portions! The maki rolls are better than any comparably priced sushi restaurant as well as the dinner combination boxes. 

We arrived at 6:45pm and it wasn't full, when we left at 8:00pm there was a line up at the door to get a table."}
{"text":"Horrible service and sushi slathered in every kind of mystery sauce you can imagine. Not even good value for what you're getting. The server was flying around like a a headless chicken, even though there were only three tables she was looking over. I know you have to be open minded on the service in places like these, but slamming down food and ignoring you completely even when you walk up to the counter to pay the bill is a little too much"}
{"text":"The lunch special was very good. The portions are big so it's good value for your money. Some of the serving staff have a bit of difficulty communicating in English though."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, we were lucky to get a spot just after 7 p.m. despite the restaurant being nearly full already.  I already knew I wanted to order sushi so I got the Roll Set 5 Spicy combo.  K ordered the Roll Set 2 (14 pcs) with Tempura.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and because we were hungry, we also ordered the Chicken Katsu and Edamame for starters too.

We were first given a bowl of miso soup and \"Noodle Crunch Soup\" each to start.  Ken was impressed that we had the later bowl of soup too and how big the first bowl was.  I liked the Noodle Crunch Soup just as much as I did the first time around.

The \"Chicken Katsu\" was thin strips of chicken fried.  It was just okay to me; I liked the plum sauce that came with it though.

The Edamame was average.

Since the server knew we were sharing our food, both of our roll sets got combined onto one plate.  I love the presentation of food here!  Also, their service was really good; the female server was so friendly and smiley.

The plate of our sushi rolls looked so good.  Just as they did two years ago, they still serve their sushi platters with a sake cup of fake flowers.

Mmm, the sushi was good.  I was reminded on this visit of how good the ratio of rice to fish is.  There was barely any rice seen in the rolls!  This was really nice.  I enjoyed satisfying my craving of sushi rolls.  I ended up really enjoying the California roll in K's roll set more than the ones I had since the California roll tasted cleaner.  By that, I mean that it was more simple flavours and doesn't have too much overflavouring.  The Spider Roll was surprisingly just okay to me; it was a little hard.

The shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura were good.  I really like broccoli tempura.

We finished the meal again with some sliced oranges in Japanese style!

Yay for a great return meal here at ToNe Sushi!  I know this is a solid spot for sure now."}
{"text":"There are so many highly-rated sushi spots in Toronto that we found it tough to pick one, but we ended up going with To-Ne because it was located near Graffiti Alley. We were seated quickly by a very polite server. The menu contains most of the sushi restaurant regulars; the prices for lunch combinations (a cup of soup, a tiny salad, and 15-18 pieces of sushi) were the area standard $15-20, while a la carte sushi was a bit pricier than what I'm used to. My fiance got the California Roll, and I chose a selection of spicy rolls with some a la carte unagi rolls.

The soup and salad were the standard Japanese restaurant fair. They were small portions, but that's fine as a starter. The miso soup didn't have the many cubes of tofu I'm used to, but the broth was flavorful. We really liked the dressing on the salad, too, which was a light pineapple vinaigrette rather than the usual creamy ginger dressing I'm used to seeing.

My sushi was excellent. The spicy salmon, tuna, and crab all had just the right amount of heat to them. They were rolled perfectly--no rice falling all over the place here! And the unagi was some of the best I've had, delicate and full of flavor. My fiance's roll, however, wasn't quite as good. They used a ton of avocado and very little of the other ingredients, so most of what my partner tasted was avocado and rice. He was far more interested in my rolls after he tasted them.

The atmosphere is nice; tables are decently spaced, the restaurant lights are dimmed, and it was overall cool and comfortable. The place was relatively full during our visit, but it was still quiet and enjoyable. You have to make your way down some perilous stairs to reach the restroom, but that's very common in the city.

Overall, I don't think this is my personal favorite sushi place, and the California roll could be better balanced. But I'd have no problem recommending it to others."}
{"text":"Delicious, well presented sushi at a great price. It's the perfect place to stop if you're out on Queen W and suddenly feel hungry. I'm definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"What is it with restaurants and their need to start their evening clean with bleach (!) while folks are still dining? This is unacceptable. We were finishing dinner and were overcome with the smell of detergent. The waiters were very kind, polite, but not attentive. Tea was good. Miso soup and ice cream were available, but not complementary. Hwe Dup Bap, a bowl of assorted sashimi and vegetables on rice served with Korean hot sauce, was bland, a disappointment. I'll stick with Sushi On Bloor if I'm being perfectly honest."}
{"text":"I found this great little sushi place on Queen St W one night. The hot summer roll is so refreshing and a great option if you are looking for a low carb option - they use cucumber instead of rice and seaweed. It's really good!"}
{"text":"My constant sushi craving flared again today so my friend and I tried To-ne sushi as yelpers provided positive reviews.

Place is clean and spacious. Servers are very friendly and attentive. We took our time to study the menu as it was quite extensive but the servers were patient with us. 

Food was terrific. We ordered edamame, shrimp and veggie tempura, salmon sashimi and roll combo #6. The presentation was amazing. I can't believe they use real flowers to decorate each plate! You can tell the sushi master takes his time to put all the effort in- this is food made with love! It was a very pleasant dining experience and totally hit the spot!

Would definitely return very soon, tomorrow? :P"}
{"text":"This place is way underrated, definitely one of the best sushi spots in Toronto. Haven't seen another place like it that matches their combination of quality and quantity."}
{"text":"The sushi boat is amazing! The interior looks a bit small but the food makes up for it all"}
{"text":"Working in the neighbourhood and after a visit to CB2 Keith and I hopped in here for a quick lunch before heading back to work .

It was lunchtime and every table but one had customers. 
Two servers were very busy for this small restaurant and did very well.
The menu was very well composed, many choices for a variety of customers. 
Keith ordered Wonton soup and a variety of Sushi 
I ordered a Shrimp Dumpling soup and a Dragon roll. 

With in a couple minutes the serves brings us a little bowl of chef soup (amuse bouche), it was very nice, complex flavours of mushrooms, baby noodles, seaweed and not sure what else. It was very nice, but kind of odd since we both had ordered soup. 

Then the server brings over for Keith miso soup and salad which came with his sushi......needless to say, we laughed and laughed...so much soup ! 

When the sushi and roll arrived, they were plated beautifully, with fresh flowers, white ginger and wasabi. 

The sushi, roll and soups were great....nice little place. Hope to return."}
{"text":"I frequently eat here, whether it's take out or sit-down. The presentation and the quality of the food is sublime. The price is quite reasonable as well. Personally, I have never received bad service either as long as you're able to get their attention. They allow alterations sushi sets, price difference considered. 

When ordering take-out, I recommend calling ahead as food orders can take as long as 30 minutes if they are backed up at the restaurant. I always call ahead if I am making a pick up order and have always received my food on time. There is also a complimentary soup they offer while waiting. 

Amazing food, decent price."}
{"text":"so I went last night with a group of us and I made a reservation at 7pm for 8people.  This was a Monday night.  Well sushi must had been on everyone's mind cause the place was jumping when I arrived.  I was thinking it was good I made a reservation.!!! NOT...I found my comrades sitting on chairs in the back waiting for our table.   They had arrived at 6:45pm to make sure they didn't our table away.  They were told it would be 10 minutes!!! And to make a long story short, we got our table at 7:45pm..after the rush.  so the 1 star is for that.  .....the story is actually worse and if it hadn't been for intervention on our part, we probably would had been waiting longer.  If I could give a zero for service....I would. 

here's why, after that, as we got our 'free' appetizers before any drinks arrived ..the tables weren't even set yet as chopsticks were nowhere.  Plus our miso soups came almost at the end of the meals.  LOL.....luckily we came for the company and not the service!

The food itself..I'd give it 3.5 stars.  it's a bit better than average. 
The presentation was on huge plates with flowers and drizzles of sauce to make it look rather fancy.  The actual food was decent.  The sushi was decent.  Not the worse but certainly not the best but for the price point it was average to above average depending on the fish.  I ordered some uni to see how fresh it was.  It was fresh but too cold so it didn't quite have that melt in your mouth quality that I like.  

I had black cod.  it's cooked and fatty, so hard to overcook that one.  
The free eppetizers were tempura vegetables and a small somen noodle sampling. The tempura were fried nicely in clean oil.   The somen was tasty.
The only other thing they did to keep us from boiling over was let us pay separately as opposed to forcing the 15% gratuity.  I appreciated that.  

I was told by one of my mates that they have been several times without incident.  And it was quite busy when I arrived...usually all good signs.  But I'd veer away from groups larger than 4 here, as they don't seem to care if you have a reservation."}
{"text":"In a city where Sushi joints are ubiquitous, and half of them are run not by Japanese or Korean people (whose cuisines actually contain sushi), but rather Chinese, proprietors (not that that MUST be a bad thing, it just usually is), To-Ne stands out like a beacon of nummy hope.

The owners, waitstaff and chefs are all extremely friendly and know the value of providing excellent service.

This has become our go-to place for Japanese food, and we knew from inception that we were at a place that was a notch above when our Sushi presentations arrived bedecked with very real and skillfully arranged floral mini-bouquets.

If you order anything of substance, they'll start you off with a complimentary cup of their house Crunch Noodle Soup (in fact, we find we get some even if all we do is just grab takeout), and it's actually really good!  Not sure exactly what kind of stock it is, but it's clean-tasting, and riddled with bits of thin noodle, shreds of seaweed and what they call \"Crunch\", which are simply crispy bits of deep-fried batter, that somehow, impossibly, STAY crunchy in the soup!

We've never been disappointed by anything on the menu.  Our favourites are:

- Volcano Roll - a roll filled with a spicy mince of Toro, spicy mayo and Crunch bits, artfully stacked and topped with a mound more of the mixture to resemble an overflowing volcano
- Tornado Roll - roll with shrimp, cream cheese (not my favourite thing usually, but it works here), spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, with a spicy sauce basted over it so that they can apply a profuse layer of their Crunch bits (if you haven't figured it out yet, we LOVE these, btw)
- Mozzarella and Beef Roll - an appetizer - well executed, and pretty self-explanatory
- Galbi - extremely tasty marinated, grilled beef ribs
- Sashimi boat - fairly standard assortment, but always excellent quality and preparation
- Tako-su Salad - seaweed, cucumber and octopus salad, with a light ponzu dressing - fresh and a perfect lead-in to your main
- Ikura Sushi - generous portion of big, salty salmon roe

At the end of the meal, you always get a complimentary dessert of fresh fruit, as well, and you'll know they like you if you wind up getting other lagniappe, as well.

We were worried for the first year that it might not survive (which often happens to restos along Queen W), but it appears we aren't the only fans, as they fill up nearly every night.

Do yourself a favour, and come here for some excellent Japanese food."}
{"text":"We liked it here. Had the bento box with some other orders of sushi on the side. Delicious! Loved their miso soup. Service was good. Quick to give refills.

Avoid that place called Aji Sai Japanese Restaurant (be sure to read my review about that place)"}
{"text":"Don't order anything from the kitchen. The only thing this place is good for is sushi. I had the seafood udon stir fried and they gave me chopped up frozen seafoods :( it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite sushi place in the city. The fact that it's just down the street from my house, makes it even sweeter. To-ne Sushi's high rating says it all. The great food and service says it all. From a cheerful 'hello!' when you walk in, to a cheerful 'goodbye' when you walk out, the staff definitely makes you feel welcomed. 

I've dined-in and done take out from To-ne over a dozen times by now in the past two years. The sushi rolls are also always tightly rolled and I have never had one fall apart on me, while I was eating it. That's something I can't say for a number of other sushi places, I've been too. They also taste delicious of course and one of the roll sets of 20+ pieces is usually enough to fill 2 people up. It is pricier than other sushi places, but I'm more than willing to pay a little extra, if it means great quality and taste.

Besides the great Dynamite and spicy tuna and salmon rolls, AND sushi salmon pizza!, the hospitality at To-ne always stands out in my mind. Even when I order take out and I'm waiting for my order, the staff have always been kind enough to give me one of those little noodle soups to sip on, while I wait. It's little things like that, that make someone enjoy coming back to a restaurant, time and time again."}
{"text":"Visited with 3 other friends on a Saturday night for dinner.

I had the chirashi special with rice ($26) and although you might want to immediately think that for $26 you could stuff yourself at an AYCE place, the sashimi was definitely a step above.

The sashimi pieces are thick-cut and have nice little flourishes for each piece of sashimi that is served to you.   There was a thinly sliced jalapeno with each piece of aji, lemon slices for the kanpachi, and nicely seared pieces of aburo sashimi.  It tasted very fresh and filling.  Not frozen at all.

They also offer you a small bowl of noodle soup as a pre-starter as well as the salad and miso soup for your meal.

I think this place is definitely a place to drop in for some better-than-AYCE sashimi."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and it's definitely a really great deal. I got the chirashi bowl which came with TWO soups and a salad! The sashimi was fresh and shockingly filling. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and I decided to check it out. First impression of the restaurant was positive; tables not placed too close to each other and very neat a clean.

I went for $12.95 sashimi lunch. Can't really get sashimi for less than that, so I adjusted m expectations. To my surprise, everything was fresh and delicious good quality fish. 

This is my go-to sushi joint near my workplace from now on after Sushi Xtra went out of business. Value for money is excellent!"}
{"text":"Sushi and house saki were both amazing. And the service was good. We sat at the sushi bar and the the gentleman was very nice and made sure we were taken care of. We will return if we are back in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh, good quality sushi, but could be more creative with their menu; offerings were pretty typical. Pieces were quite small for what you get, so I will look for other places next time.

Quality of sashimi was ok, it was quite fresh. 
Service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Came here for an early mid-week dinner. Got there right before 6, the place was fairly empty but by 7pm is started to fill up. The service was nice and attentive, all the servers were very soft spoken. Got a small cup of noodle soup to start with, which was quite salty but was nice and warm. 

Got a small sushi and sashimi boat to share which was about $45 for 42 pieces, thought it felt a bit less than that. It was nicely presented with flowers and a fancy cut cucumber. There was a good selection of sashimi and sushi. With an avocado and tempura shrimp roll  and a basic plain salmon roll. The rice was on the mushier side though. 

Overall it was ok, not bad not good, not outstanding and pretty passable. So average that I have no strong feelings haha"}
{"text":"Delicious maki rolls, probably one of the best in Toronto. At this rate I rather go to To-Ne for its quality over AYCE. Unfortunately the service isn't the best, there are usually only 1-2 servers for the entire place when it's packed. So we had to wait a while to get something on our table. Otherwise, I would highly recommend the food here!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch and Dinner
Specialty: Japanese
Menu items: Miso soup, Green Eyes roll, Green Dragon roll and Spicy Salmon roll

Toronto is known for being host to many great Japanese restaurants. Some are good, others just ok, and then there are those little hidden gems that just blow your mind away and make you go \"Yum!\". To-ne Sushi, gets to be one of those places that I crave when I am in the mood for Japanese, and especially sushi.

I fell in like with To-ne when I started working in the Fashion district, otherwise known as the Spadina/Queen/King west area in downtown Toronto. The owners not only lured me in with their welcoming smiles, friendly service and fantastic complementary miso soup (which by the way has tempura bits), but also with their fresh and yummy concoction of sushi platters. My favourite yet - the Green Eyes Roll. 

The Green Eyes roll is like an inverted version of a Green Dragon roll. You have your buttery avocado in the centre, wrapped in seaweed, rice and sesame seeds, then topped with a slightly cooked layer of salmon and deep-fried on the outside with tempura batter. I mean, it can not get better than this.

Aside from the eyes roll creation, which tastes fantastic. To-ne also knocks it out of the park with their plating style. Flowers, saucy shapes and large plates are all representative of what To-ne is all about.

When I order all 3 of the rolls, oh yes! I can devour all these in one seating. I get the almost \"inverted\" version of the Green Eyes roll, the Green Dragon roll, which is my second favourite, and an order of the Spicy Salmon roll.

The Green Dragon roll has tempura battered shrimp wrapped in rice, sesame seeds and then topped with avocado. Like I said, the inverse.  The Spicy Salmon roll is just a delicious mixture of salmon sashimi (i.e. raw salmon) mixed in with some saucy spices, then wrapped in seaweed and rice. Fresh, tasty and with a nice kick to it.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll for take out. They prepared it very fast and the rolls were good. Prime location on Queen West."}
{"text":"Of course we checked the reviews before coming. It was our first time. We ordered the deluxe sashimi, uni sushi, and salmon roe suhsi. 

The sashimis were fresh and I guess the price is reasonable in the area. I loved the salad dressing. It had a little bit of citrus flavour which I found it very refreshing. Services were just okay. They didnt come to refill the water and we had to flag them down twice to order the food. 

Well.....I would rather to go a Japanese All You Can Eat restaurant since its about the same price range."}
{"text":"Oh my god where do i start? Waitresses ate extremely nice, the food made my mouth watered and yes, as expected, THE FOOD TASTED AMAZING! ugh can't wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and unique rolls. Pleasant, unhurried service. Beautiful sushi presentation with a little flower arrangement on the tray. I recommend the Toronto and Legend rolls - yum!"}
{"text":"The vibe: Classic Sushi joint vibes. A nice escape from busy Queen West. 

The food: Delicious and affordable. We ordered a lunch special and were able to share it between 2 people because it came with 20 rolls. TWENTY ROLLS! Little ones, but still. 

My go to meal: I'd definitely come back for the veggie dumplings. 

Secret: You get not one, but two soups as an appetizer. Bonus soup!"}
{"text":"We love this place and bring our friends often. It is consistently good sushi and really good presentation too.

Everything is good. I'm a fan of the Tornado roll, dynamite roll, the tempura and all of the salads.

Service is slow though so budget time to get seated and be patient!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this restaurant! We shared the Rocky Mountain roll as many reviewers mentioned it -- I thought it was only okay but my friends really liked it (was too sweet for me). I had the roll set 1 (California and dynamite rolls and tempura), and it was so filling I actually hated myself afterwards. 

The food came extremely fast and service was good as they could tell we were dehydrated and kept coming back to refill our glasses with water. We all ordered something that came with complimentary miso soup... But that arrived only after this mini ramen appetizer? And then some of us had salad in our dinner set? By the time my tempura arrived I was sadly full of liquids but the tempura was very fresh so I chowed down anyway! I found that all the maki had an UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF AVOCADO, not that I'm complaining because I love avocado, but it seriously filled me up (and I can see it being overwhelming for those who don't like the taste). 

Overall the food is of excellent value and good quality! They brought the bill over with watermelon slices and as if we couldn't have been more impressed with the sheer amount of food we've been given so far...there were candies in the bill holder.

Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Updated review: 
My absolute favourite sushi place. It's always outstanding, and the fish is always fresh. 

It never lets me down. They also have great delivery (I order through orderit.ca). Delivery can take up to an hour, but it's worth the wait. 

The food is always fresh, and very packaged. Nothing ever looks tired or old. 

You can't go wrong with the following: 

Sushi Pizza (salmon)  
Deep Fried Tempura ( shrimp and vegetable)  
Gyoza 
Tempura Roll 
Yam Tempura Roll 
Green Dragon Roll
Dynamite Roll   
Kamikaze Roll
Spicy Tuna Roll

They also have this spicy mayo you can also dip your sushi in, and it's so good.

While you'll pay a bit more, you can tell it's a grade above the rest.

8/6/2010 
5 stars. 

Like all of these other reviews, I too, wasn't expecting much.
We were welcomed by a large blinking neon 'OPEN' sign in the front window. 

The decor was quite nice. Hard wood floors, nice warm lighting & very simple decor on the walls. I noticed how every few tables, had a nice wooden partition, making you feel like you had a bit more privacy which is a nice change.

Servers were sweet & soft spoken. 
Tea wasn't free. 
Pop was $2.75
Washrooms downstairs *typical for Queen St W units (but they're very clean here!) 

What my date & I shared:
STARTERS:
Tempura veggies & shrimp - which was AMAZING. The batter they use is unbelievably light and fluffy. They put the smaller veggies (ex: mushrooms) on a skewer, and then deep fry it that way. The result, is an amazing single bite of a single mushroom. 
YUM!

Gyoza (veggie) - These were unbelievable. I thought I'd miss the pork, but the wonderful fresh taste of veggie's made up for it. The first word that came to mind as I had my first taste was FRESH!  
They weren't greasy, or sticky. 

MAINS
Spicy Tuna Roll - AMAZING & fresh tasting. Nice tight small roll, with quality tuna. I could really taste the difference.

Special of the Day - Lobster Salad Roll - My date suggested this, and I agreed hesitantly. But I have to admit, they were damn tasty. Another big winner.

All plates were served with style ... little swirls of different sauces to try. I was impressed, and can't wait to go back.

The meal is finished with a slice of watermelon for each guest.
When I was in China, this was the traditional way they finish each meal.
And really brought back memories of my travels through Asia. 

This place is a total hidden gem. 
And now my go-to place during my next craving of sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here was alright. Had the tempura for appetizer and then ordered a dragon roll, california roll, and spicy salmon roll to share with a friend. The rolls are pretty big and filling. Spicy salmon was super spicy."}
{"text":"awesome sushi, great set dinners, good over all. would recommend this for someone looking for NON all you can eat, as aji sai is across the street for those of you looking for that. 

definitely try the avocado crunch wrap, made spicy! it was by far the best thing i had there."}
{"text":"A solid choice for lunch. A little more expensive than other places around, but higher quality."}
{"text":"I ordered a green dragon roll and they gave me sushi that amounted to the volume of my fist (I have very small hands). The rice was mushy and there was very little filling. They also forgot the soy sauce which I guess isn't really important but really doesn't add to the scenario. Definitely better places to go to for sushi, like rexall or a local green bin."}
{"text":"The sushi here is good. Reasonably priced for downtown's standards.  The dragon rolls are really nice.

If I were to eat at any sushi place on queen st, it would be here."}
{"text":"The sushi is okay I had better. Everything was fresh of course but the dish was just okay it was average. I suggest this place for a lunch rather than dinner. The service was good the prices okay."}
{"text":"I went to this place while visiting Toronto. Wouldn't come here again for a variety of reasons.

1. Waitstaff service is surly and forgot half of food order.

2. They skimmed a tip for themselves upon payment with cash, without consent, for a party of TWO.

3. Sushi isn't that great."}
{"text":"i rarely give out 1-star reviews, but the service and quality i received deserves nothing more.

we walked by here on a whim, and after spending new years in tokyo, we randomly decided on a few bites of nigiri for nostalgia's sake. now i'm not holding it to an authentic japanese standard?? but the Toro-Negi roll i had tasted like rice crispies. and there was barely any rice.

to the chef's defense, my dining partner liked the nigiri.

what urked me the most was the service. the waitress seemed perplex that we were ordering so few items, as if we were taking up her time. (this was at 2pm-ish and there were empty seats)

she followed up by not giving us our tea for 20 minutes, after which i had to go up and request it. her demeanor after continued to be curt and short.

this is hands down the worst service i've received in life! non-english speaking hole-in-the-walls have given better food and service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good, high quality sushi at a reasonable  price then check this place out...I stopped in for lunch, and got you the spicy roll special - 6 spicy salmon, 6 spicy tuna and 6 spicy crab rolls with miso soup and salad - all for $14.50! What a steal! 

My buddy ordered Salmon sashimi (5), mixed sushi (5) and 6 piece California rolls, with miso soup and salad - all for $14.50! We ate family style and could barely finish everything...to top it off free green tea!

The sashimi was ok, but the sushi was excellent and maki was phenomenal! I don't know about you, but I like my spicy rolls with a bit of crunch and this is exactly what they were! The California roll was really good too - melt in your mouth avocado...mmm..I can still taste it 

If you're in the area and are looking for a place for a quick bite, this is the place to go! 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It started when we sat for a good 10 minutes before a waitstaff came around to take our order, never offering a drink when we sat down? The sushi was just O.K and we ordered 8 different rolls. The salmon skin tasted more burn then crispy, salmon was to thick for a roll and the eel also tasted more BBQed then it should. The crowd died down as we finished but still took a long while for the bill to come and again to pay it.  Way to many others in the area to do this one again. On the flip side the place is nice inside, presentation  was nice and the bill was only $60 ish with tempura veggies and soup for three."}
{"text":"It s a bit pricy..but trust me the sushi is worth it!!! I absolutely love the tornado and sunrise sushi.. The service is a tinyyy bit slow.. but again what follows is the mouth watering rolls which leave you wanting for more. The udon isnt my favourite but its again a personal taste problem. casual ambience and yet the way the platters are served are nothing less than a 4 star hotel."}
{"text":"After seeing the great documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\", I desperately needed to eat sushi. But my go-to sushi restaurant was closed on Sunday, as were many other sushi restaurants in the neighbourhood, except for To-ne.

The restaurant was quiet which was nice. I ordered from their special menu: Albacore Tuna sushi and Rocky Mountain Roll. 

The albacore tuna was delicious, fresh and gentle in flavour.  The Rocky Mountain Roll was spicy salmon in the roll as well as on top, along with jalapenos and drizzled with a coconut cream sauce. It sounds spicier than it was, it had a nice kick to it and the coconut sauce was something different. I also loved the presentation of the mini floral arrangement on the plate. How pretty!

Each dish is served with a great miso soup that includes noodle and tempura bits. 

Still hungry, I ordered the gyozas that came piping hot. They were tasty, but I realized that it was a mistake on my part to eat something fried after enjoying a nice light dinner. Oh well. Lesson learned. 

To-ne Sushi is a nice little place and one I'll keep in mind when I'm craving sushi on a Sunday again."}
{"text":"I always crave sushi.  Another sushi love and I came here a couple weeks ago on a Friday night.  It was a full house, although the restaurant is not big itself.  We were sitting next to a birthday party of about 10-12 people, and halfway through dinner, the staff dimmed the lights to bring out a cake with candles while Happy Birthday was playing over the speakers.  I thought that was kind of neat!  The decor is nothing fancy, just plain with tables and chairs.  When I dine a sushi restaurants, I ALWAYS get sashimi, and then seek for rolls that is signature to that restaurant.  I  rarely go for the typical rolls.  Why would I? So many better things to try?  We had a hard time, but finally decided with the aid of the server's recommendation.

Tornado Roll: (5/5 stars)
-Spicy tuna| tempura shrimp| cream cheese| avacado| cucumber w crunch| \"special\" sriracha sauce.
I don't usually like sushi with cream cheese in it.  But there was so much going on with this roll that you barely even notice the heavy cream cheese.  You can definitely taste it along with everything else, but somehow it all worked together!  The spicy sauce on top was just the perfect finish!

Legend Roll: (5/5 stars)
The server recommended this one, and we were completely satisfied.  There's a variety of fish sashimi atop a spider roll.  It was delicious, but much lighter than the Tornado roll.  Thus, some of the flavours were masked by the bold Tornado flavours.

Sashimi & Tempura Combo: (5/5 stars)
We EACH got one of these for our appetizers.  What a great deal! 6 pieces of salmon sashimi + 2 shrimp tempura and some vegetable tempura as well! 

Service: (3/5 stars)
The ladies were very friendly.  However, I couldn't really understand them with their thick accents.  Service is also a little slow.  Our server actually only gave us one serving of the sashimi till I asked her for the second order.  She apologized and came back along w the missing tempura.  Halfway through dinner, she also came back to ask if we got our amuse-bouche, which we did not.  So she served us our amuse-bouche in the middle of dinner.  Oh well, food was delicious!

The prices are pretty fair as well.  Very casual atmosphere with delicious sushi on the busy Queen St West of Toronto.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great prices! Casual, relaxed atmosphere and attentive service. It's my second time here! Very much enjoying myself! :)"}
{"text":"Stay away from their seafood udon noodle soup.
It was bad. Seafood was not fresh at all. Noodle was too soggy. Feel like wasting of money."}
{"text":"Great place!  I've always thought that the true test of a good sushi restaraunt was the quality of their sashimi.  To-Ne did not disappoint.  The Sake was fresh with little slivers of jalapeno to give it some \"heat\".  The spicy tuna maki rolls were drool worthy.  Unlike some places that like to drown their fish in spicy mayo, To-Ne gives it just the right amount of heat while still being able to SEE the fish (of which there was plenty).  Four pieces of sashimi and one maki roll and I was full, imagine that!  Anyway to convince these guys to set up shop in Chicago??  An extra star for playing Amy Winehouse in the background! :p"}
{"text":"To-ne sushi has a great location at Queen and Spadina. They have ample space for sitting and authentic design to the restaurant which makes this a place to check out. The plate design was also fantastic as they come with flower arrangement on the plate. As for the sushi I found it a little plain and the size of the sushi was a little large. Overall I had a great experience here and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"It will help fill the sushi craving.

I won't go back.

Spider roll had crab that was heavily breaded and over fried.  It was crunchy grease in my mouth with wasabi and soy sauce.

Toro sushi was fresh.

Salmon roll had cream cheese hunks that were WAY too large.  

Edamame beans were small and bland.

Just keep walking..."}
{"text":"I dislike that male waiter. It was nearly closing and he took us to two people table when there were better tables that weren't taken. Glad the female waitress asked us to sit somewhere else for more room. The total cost was $42. And we gave them three $20 bills which it's $60. And the male waiter had the guts to ask if we want change. WE will never come back again."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, all the servers were so kind to us.

And sushi was phenomenal! We had the Black Dragon, California, and Dynamite rolls. All fantastic. Good price for good food. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is your solid, standard budget sushi place. Quality is decent and service is prompt. The lunch sets are affordable, around $10-15 each including soup, salad, rice. There are some nice touches like a little bouquet of flowers with you sushi or a tiny bowl of skinny noodles with your miso soup. Sushi was good -- not overloaded with rice like at some places. The music choice is a bit random (pop from all different eras) but the ambiance is quiet and comfortable. I would be back if I'm in this 'hood and craving sushi without wanting to spend too much."}
{"text":"My new go-to. Rocky Mountain roll is fantastic! Great atmosphere busy, casual, and delicious food. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Continues to impress. Went with a another couple friend and ordered the 40 pieces of assorted sushi - comes in a fancy boat. Perfect for ones who don't know what to order."}
{"text":"Average sushi, mediocre service and poor house wine."}
{"text":"Overall great dining experience because was with good company. The sushi in the love boat seemed typical except for the fact that some had jalapeno slices on them, which I felt enhanced the flavor. However a friend of mine stated it deteared the taste of the actual fish. Anyways to each their own.. overall I suppose if going again would get my own roll. The rolls in other pictures seem quite a bit above average, however I wish there were more blow torched sushi options. The designs of the roles seem quite intricate, there seems to be an above par depiction in ingredients but definitely not differentiating from the norm that much.

We also tried some of their tempura, interesting design with a huge circular taro chip, but me personally would not order another tempura next time because to me tempura is fried, unhealthy and tastes the same as any other Japanese restaurant generally. Unless 1 decides to douse it in aioli oil with some other type of flavoring of flour and sprinkle with some seaweed, bonito flakes or something innovative then maybe I'd reconsider..

The complementary miso-enoki soup was great, but given that the sushi was ordinary it doesn't compensate for the common selection. The butterfish was quite good tho, as it melted in my mouth, generally I'd say that some buffets may seem a bit tougher at first.

Korean owned Japanese restaurant that I would try and suggest improving your service quality. It seemed that the waiters and waitresses were kind of flailing to take orders but when I needed them had difficulty grabbing their attention or even finding them. That being said they don't just straight up ignore you because they want the lazy mundane way out of their shift, but attentiveness is always a good trait.

I'd suggest trying a roll or Harujuku cooler, next time you go here.

Overall because I had good company. I'd hesitate for a 4, but give it a 3 because the sushi boat pieces were quite average."}
{"text":"Not bad. I truly want to give 3.5 stars but yelp doesn't let me. We had a great time here and it tasted pretty good. Ordered the sushi boat and a seaweed salad. 

First, the service was good and friendly although it took some time to get their attention. They apologized by giving us some free soups. 

The presentation was also pretty good. 

The good on the other hand was nothing spectacular. It's pretty basic sushi. Come here if you just want to get your sushi fix. It's simple and good. 

So the place in general deserves a 4 star but the food is 3 star. I went with 3 because that's what this is about! The food! But if you're reading this 3.5 for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Location: conveniently close to Queen/Spadina, good space 

Food: quality sashimi, yummy maki rolls including Rocky Mountain (coconut sprinkle on top!), fire roll, crispy tempura, fresh salad, nicely brewed green tea

Service: Excellent

My other go-to sushi place other than Mi-ne  in downtown. They really know how to cut their sashimi properly!!

Highly recommended. I would go back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi places I have had downtown! They pack the rolls with so much fish and other ingredients - the sushi rolls are hefty! We had the dynamite roll, spicy salmon, black dragon and green dragon rolls - all was scrumptious. I didn't give it five stars because it's a little bit more on the pricier end - but i would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service and flowers with every main. Lovely!   Fresh fish"}
{"text":"The best sushi we've had in Toronto, at least in this price range. The portions and sushi-to-rice ratios are both very generous. Attentive and friendly service. Nice decor. We had a sushi/sashimi/maki combo platter and a fusion roll and it was more than plenty."}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend and it was delicious. The service was friendly when we arrived and we were promptly brought water with lemon and the menus. The restaurant was really clean as well as the bathrooms located in the basement. We were also given complimentary miso ramen that was very small but delicious. We ordered the small sashimi, sushi, and roll love boat that came with 42 pieces. The fish was absolutely amazing. Every piece in it tasted great and you could definitely tell how fresh it was. The green dragon roll was probably one of the best I've ever had. The only downside was that the sashimi pieces for most of the fish, pretty much everything but the salmon, were really small. I've seen sashimi at other restaurants at double the size and I was disappointed that the pieces were tiny. However, the quality was amazing for the price which means I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Tone is nestled near 4 other sushi places along Queen, so it has a lot of places to compete against. If you were choosing among them, this would be your date location. You won't get as much sushi as Aji Sai and the prices won't be as cheap as Xtra Sushi, but you will be in the nicest looking restaurant and the food quality is better. 

The place is smaller and nicer looking than its neighbouring sushi restaurants. The sushi choices are about the same as most other restaurants, but there's less fusion or inventive rolls. Each platter comes really nicely done up with nice garnishing (carrot flower, etc.) The sushi itself is tasty enough considering the price and the rice is nicely flavoured. 

The only real issue here is the service. While they will often seat you and see to your drinks and initial food order quickly, don't expect them to stop by too often after that. It seems that quality of service is randomized depending on how overwhelmed the server is feeling (which doesn't always seem to reflect how many patrons are actually in the restaurant). 

I'd also like to give my opinion on their take out, but the two times I called, they didn't answer the phone. So while I would love to give them full stars, I would love to see their customer service improve a bit first. That isn't to say they are unfriendly, they just need more training. 

All in all, this is a good date spot or a nice place to bring one or two friends. If you have a bigger group, head somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've passed this place countless times but never gave it a chance. From the outside, it looks like just another average sushi place. But I went for an early solo dinner on a friend's recommendation and it was great! The wait staff are extremely kind and accommodating but it was a bit slow that afternoon as they had a lot of take out orders to tend to. 

The food was really great, had a rainbow roll, ika squid sushi, and some small appetizer..Must have been miso soup or wakame or something. I forget. They give you a crunchy noodle broth at the beginning which was a nice surprise. The rainbow roll was very nicely presented (but not a fan of the spicy mayo drizzle), and the fish and avocado were perfectly fresh. The plate was garnished with a tiny vase of flowers which was a very pretty addition but a touch unnecessary, especially in the dim light where you can't appreciate the real fresh flowers. The best part, though, was that the rice was perfect. It was seasoned well, actually allowed to cool (and not warm or hot as some restaurants don't take the time to cool the rice), and there wasn't too much of it. Great! The atmosphere and decor are a little lacking but it didn't affect my experience. 

Price was a bit more than I would want to pay for a single sushi meal ($25 ish plus tip) but it really was above average. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Order takeout from here at work twice a month.  Decent food and portion.  However the wasabi tonight might have gone bad, it tasted funny and ruined the taste of my salmon sashimi.   Also a suggestion to the restaurant, please make a hole on the box lid for tempura orders to keep them from becoming too soggy when they arrive."}
{"text":"My dinner date and I decided to try To-ne for the first time on a quiet weeknight. Miso soup interestingly topped with noodles and tempura bits arrived before we could even decide on our mains. This was much appreciated as it had been cold outside and we very much needed the warm up. 

We ended up ordering a sashimi boat to share and were very pleasantly surprised to see how ornately it was decorated. There was a nice variety of raw fish and everything was nicely presented.

The service was pleasant and quick. The house wine arrived in very generously poured goblets. I would certainly return to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal nor have I experienced bad service and have been there quite a few times over the last year. A top shelf sushi joint.

In short, GO!

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here around seven in the evening with a friend and it was busy but there were a few empty tables so we were seated quickly. However, that's where the service ends. We were left without menu and water for ten minutes, if not more. Despite the two servers walking past the tables, they didn't notice us, and we had to signal the waitress to get the menus and drinks. If it wasn't for my friend wanting sashimi, I would have just got up and left.

I really like their miso soup with the noodles that is provided with the meal although my friend said it was a bit salty. The Takoyaki was good with the spicy mayo although I didn't taste any spice in my spicy salmon roll but at least their sushi isn't packed with rice like some other places.

Not once in the evening were we asked \"how is everything?\" and soy sauce dishes weren't provided. At the end, a male waiter came by and started clearing plates, one still with food on it, without even asking us. Not likely to come back here."}
{"text":"Food was decent, nothing extraordinary. Their beef yakisoba was not very good - very bland and majority of the dish was noodles and onions. The price isn't too bad though. Service was alright. Our waiter had trouble understanding most of the order. He didnt recognize one of the items until we pointed it out. Not horrible service given he knew little English. They could've been friendlier though, or showed a little bit of enthusiasm. I don't live around the area so I doubt I'll go back again..."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had my life. Order the item I believe it's NO.229 has combination of different rolls. Also they have best miso soup ever, has much more taste to it =D  I walked in there on a random occasion as my friend wanted to get take out from there a while ago, but to my surprise their sushi are amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't pass by this place and not take a second look - you will never regret your visit! This place has very sophisticated sushi platters and it's worth your bucks! We got salmon and tuna appetizers, and the size of them were huge! 

Definitely choose this place over all-you-can-eat any day!"}
{"text":"Tone is my go to place for lunch! I believe they have the freshest fish around this area. It's a little bit pricey but I honestly think you get what you pay for. The restaurant itself is very clean and the waitresses are very kind. Food comes on time sit in or order.

I mostly go for their lunch combos and order the chirashi which includes salad and soup. I love how fresh their fish is and the fish portions are very large. Another dish I really like is their hwe dup bap, a lot of places cheap out on the sashimi but I find tone puts a good portion."}
{"text":"Okay sushi restaurant. The actual sushi and sashimi quality and flavor were good overall. Nigiri did not have too much rice (which was good) but fish slices were on the skimpy side, though decent quality.  Some interesting ones were the seared toro sashimi and salmon belly nigiri.  The sushi boat was beautifully decorated. The meal started with a complimentary cup of dashi broth with somen noodles and bits of fried tempura batter - this was quite nice.  However, the missteps were in the appetizers: the tempura ebi had nice fresh shrimp, but the batter was a bit on the heavy side - even worse, the shoyu dipping sauce was very sweet, making it too cloying for such delicate shrimp ... better off eating it without the sauce!  The agedashi tofu was a misnomer as it consisted of fried tofu wedges drizzled with a teriyaki sauce (again too sweet) instead of the traditional dashi-based sauce and bonito flakes.  A strange quirk: wait staff would only fill water glasses half way -- and if you asked to top them off, they seemed surprised, like YOU were the strange one!  Bottom line:  Good sushi/sashimi, poorly executed appetizers, and some \"interesting\" service quirks."}
{"text":"To-ne sushi has become my go-to sushi spot in the Queen St West area. Even though there is plenty of seating, this place gets packed during the lunch time rush, so plan to get here early. The wait staff are always busy so it's hard to get their attention at times. For lunch, I usually order the chirashi sushi lunch ($11.50), which comes with a side salad, miso soup, and this other soup that comes with what I believe is ramen. The side dishes are really good, and I especially love the small ramen soup. The sashimi here is fresh, and there is a little more fish included in the chirashi compared to other places. For other dishes on the lunch menu, a small pot of flowers comes with the food. A nice, but unnecessary touch. Tea is complimentary."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant while walking down queen and decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint!

The interior is quite cozy and has a little sushi bar area. We were seated right away and service was quick. We didn't go right at prime time lunch hour though (weekend around 2pm). 

We ordered a roll set (though I don't remember which one it was) and the chicken katsu dinner. The rolls were plated nicely and the chicken katsu dinner portion was generous. The food was of good value and for two people, the two plates were more than enough food. It was also one of the best chicken katsu dishes I've had in Toronto. We then asked for the bill which came with fruit slices for dessert.

Also, the bathroom is located downstairs after a steep flight of stairs. 

Overall, an unexpected find that led to a new favourite."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I mean, the salmon pizza tastes good, the Philadelphia roll tastes good as well, a lot cream cheese inside. But seems like the soya sauce is very salty? I don't understand whether it is the soy sauce or the food itself that is salty.

And the miso soup is salty too.

But when it comes to Donburi everything just changed. The eggs are just sweet, while the meat has no flavor (not salty at all). Ummm so I don't know if I should evaluate the restaurant relatively salty? I can make a better Donburi.

The services are normal. I mean, the waiters and waitress works hard and they are nice, but they definitely need more waiters, as they are too busy that they won't be able to provide you a good service."}
{"text":"Great service, affordable, beautiful presentation of food (who decorates with real flowers? To-ne does!), free miso ramen soup, and fresh fish.

They have a huge selection of different roll set combos - which are great for sharing and trying new flavours. Though, size of the rolls have become smaller than what they used to be."}
{"text":"Love it!

I wanted to try this place for a long time and am so glad that I did. This is officially my favorite sushi restaurant in the city. 

Service is 5-stars all the way. Amazing greeting when you arrive, tea refilled instantly, and a very welcoming owner / chef with great personality.  

If you are seeking perfection in food, presentation and flavor, then To-Ne is your destination. The food is extremely fresh and excellently presented. The best test for quality at a Japanese restaurant is the sashimi, and To-Ne's sashimi was fresh beyond belief! Silky, very refreshing, and oceanic! 

A must have dish upon your visit to To-Ne is the Rocky Mountain Roll. It's the chef's very well crafted roll and has a creative combination of spicy, sweet, and sour flavours. 
Excellent service, amazing food and great atmosphere is what makes a restaurant perfect and To-Ne's got it all!

Highly recommended for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times and I REALLY enjoy their menu every time! 
I tried Bulgogi Udon,Spicy Salmon Roll, To-ne's Sushi Boat, Beef Tataki, and Veggie Spicy Roll. My favourite item is the Veggie Spicy Roll which isn't greasy at all compare to other restaurants. 
I love that they don't put too much rice in their rolls and instead put in other ingredients. 
Plus, hard working and friendly servers!

It's one of my go-to restaurants in Toronto! 

5 out of 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"Fresh, quality and delightful food with a touch of creative plating. Tone sushi deliver friendly, warm and quick service consistently. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ton-e Sushi, I don't love you a ton but you're A OK and I will be back.

A decent alternative to the more frequented sushi lunch locations around the cool loft offices and bustling shops of Queen (barely) West. 

I really enjoyed my lunch special, which comes with a salad with ginger dressing, miso soup and a bonus noodle soup in a tiny bowl. Their salmon sashimi lunch comes with more salmon than you can shake a stick at, and is definitely a stellar option for salmon fans. 

PEPPER'S PISSED about radiation. Is it still OK to order this much salmon, or am I going to be glow in the dark soon? If I glow I hope it's highlighter purple and not tennis ball green."}
{"text":"Tone Sushi is one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto!! Their plating is so beautiful and sushi is so great! I personally recommend Sunomono salad, Rocky mountain roll, beef asparagus, and sort of sushi! If you are looking for good sushi restaurant in Toronto, I definitely recommend this place! P.s: cocktail is also awesome! I like Harajuku cooler and Japanito"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap and cheerful sushi. The food is great value for money, and yummy. 

It's not going to knock your socks off, but it is really good quality for the price. Also, the servers are super friendly.

Recommend the sunrise roll."}
{"text":"I live in the area and i eat every day sushi all around the city since my work is driving around every day. Anyhow this is the best sushi in the area of 10 min walk from queen spadina. And my wife is Japanese so i know sushi. Just trust me. The food is always fresh and servers polite. The cooks does very good job. My recommendation."}
{"text":"Had a take-out order of #301, mixed sushi and sashimi. Place was pretty full, had to wait half an hour. Fish was pretty good, fresh and tasty. Might have added some rice for the sashimi. For a quick Sunday night dinner was quite a good choice, better than Hosu (about same price point) but not as good as Japango or Yuzu (which are pricier). Since To-Ne is pretty close to my place might go back there, not a bad option."}
{"text":"Being there once, invited by friends, and don't feel like returning. 

We've tried a lot of stuff that night and it was ok but so... ordinary. I can get the same food at most of the other joints. In all honesty I can't remember anything special or impressive. And yes, their rolls fall apart easily, same as everywhere. Not much to drink also, though hot sake was not bad at all.

Service was crap - typical bunch of kids who don't care if there is not enough plates or chopsticks on the table, than when you point that out - they bring more than was needed. They don't hesitate a second to slap a new plate over whatever you have on the table, or push your dish out without asking permission. You have to call them. They don't even pretend to be attentive.

And the location is... well... Queen West between Spadina and Bathurst. Not nice even in the daytime. And at night expect to enjoy a company of some bums asking for a coin, filthy walls you won't like to touch, and an occasional pool of ex-food next to the streetcar shelter.

Personally I won't hesitate too much to get there once or twice more, but not on my own desire."}
{"text":"After a mediocre dinner at Aji Sai I decided to tryout To-ne and I'm glad I did. It's refreshing to finally get decent sushi in the area. Tried #97 for lunch it was a good sized portion made well with fresh seafood. Give it a go!"}
