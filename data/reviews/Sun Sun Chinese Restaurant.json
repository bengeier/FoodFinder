{"text":"Good food, good prices. 
Want something different? Try the Beef Chow Ho Fun.
I don't know anywhere else on the west side that has it."}
{"text":"Got a basic selection of foods not very good... fried chicken was breaded with cement apparently. Spring rolls very greasy. Fried rice bad... lo mein okay.  But after bad fried rice there's no getting better from there for a Chinese place. They deliver and have online menu which I like, but that doesn't make up for the poor quality food."}
{"text":"This is our go to, take out Chinese restaurant in this neighborhood. I love the convenience of ordering online, but you do have to give it about 10 extra min til they actually get the order. Their combination meals have a lot of beef/chicken.  I usually have the rest for lunch the next day. We never ate inside, but the dining area looks pretty spacious."}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese restaurant.  Love the pot stickers.  Nothing exceptional, but all around very good."}
{"text":"Eh I wanted to try different stuff since I always get the same thing. Mistake. Fried dumplings: no. Beef lo mein : bland. No pop anymore either."}
{"text":"Food is always good & hot. Delivery is punctual. .I rarely order from any other chinese place."}
{"text":"Prices are slightly higher than our usual place, but it is worth it, not only because of the quality but also because the servings are huge (at least in the combos).

Wifey had Bourbon chicken (~$7) while I got the Thai Chicken (~$7). I was intrigued to see what that would be, as there is no actual recipe for Thai Chicken and should be labeled Thai-style (just like Szechuan should be). I expected something that was both spicy and sweet with a hint of savory. I even requested extra spicy, because I love it and because I have yet to find a place in this city that actually makes things spicy. And what I got was close to expectation, but not spicy. Still quite good. 

The pork egg roll that comes with the combo was not only hot, but not greasy! Crab Rangoon (6 for ~$4) came with a fairly authentic sauce (not La Choy at least) and contained a fair amount of crab (or imitation crab). The Egg Drop Soup (~$2) was actually made correct - not just an egg mixed into chicken broth, but a velvety mix of egg yolks and soup, almost like hollandaise.

Staff is very nice, albeit difficult to understand at times. Online ordering solve that issue though."}
{"text":"So excited I found this place. Fast and hot delivery! For $40, including delivery charge (not including tip though), I got the pepper steak combo, the teriyaki chicken combo, house fried rice, chicken pad thai, BBQ spare ribs, and a pint of both teriyaki sauce and pepper steak sauce! The pepper steak was amazing! The teriyaki was great! Their fried rice is awesome! Some of the best I've had. Egg rolls are like every other place. Ribs were decent with a noticeable amount of meat on them. It was the pad thai that was disappointing though. It was in a tomato-type sauce and the noodles were over done. Asked for extra extra spicy, but noticed none. The rest of the food more than made up for it though!"}
{"text":"Love the wonton soup! Crabmeat Rangoon's are the best I've had locally. Service is quick. Take out is my preferred way but eating in is a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Generous portions for a great price. We ordered the Chicken and Broccoli and BBQ pork lo mein for 2 and it could have easily fed 4.  Cost me only 13.00 to feed both of us plus some leftovers! 

Their carry out speed is super fast as well. They will usually have your food ready within 15 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"Sun Sun used to be our favorite place to get Chinese delivery or take-out. I loved that their website allowed online ordering (even works with mobile devices) and the food was always hot, quickly delivered, and at least average in comparison to others I had tried. Then we stumbled upon another local Chinese delivery restaurant that blew Sun Sun out of the water and we haven't been back since. I won't mention the name of that other restaurant because I think that's pretty unfair, but you can check out my other reviews. 

What follows is my original review. Even though we found a better option, I still believe Sun Sun is at least average and worth a try. If you're like me, you want to be sure you have tried all of the local Chinese restaurants, so what are you waiting for? 

My Original Review:
In the 2+ years that we have been ordering from Sun Sun, we have had only positive experiences. The food is hot and tastes good. Their menu is diverse and contains several meats as well as vegetarian options. The online menu has a 'notes' field, so you can easily ask them to hold an ingredient or add extras. 

Every time we order, our food is delivered faster than I ever expect. We get A LOT of food for very little money and the purchase couldn't be easier. So far, they have never made a mistake with our order. 

Good food, good prices, easy ordering online, and speedy delivery - what more can a person want?! Gotta run - tonight's order just arrived!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sun Sun twice now and both meals were good.  The meals taste authentic and they use quality ingredients.  Today, I had the Chicken Chow Mein and it was good.  Since I never know what to expect when I order Chinese, today was no exception.  I thought I ordered something with a dark brown, spicy sauce, but it ended up being a clear sauce.  It was still good.  Egg roll was really good.

The fried rice is dark brown with chopped green onions and has a pretty good taste.  It's not nearly as good as Dragon Gate, but it's decent.

$13 for two lunches with water.

Recommend!"}
