{"text":"Was looking for a place to take my wife for sushi (rolls) for our anniversary, and found Shimogamo highly reviewed on Yelp. I read that they often get packed during prime hours, so when I saw they take OpenTable reservations I booked it right away.   We arrived, and were greeted by name at the door and seated right away. They weren't completely full, but still at about 75% capacity of their smaller restaurant. It was also happy hour, so we got the full menus, happy hour menus, and a nice order sheet for the sushi so we could just mark what we wanted on that. Waitress was at our table immediately to take our drink order. She was super polite, and extremely efficient.  We ordered 3 rolls and the gyoza appetizer. The Spicy Yellowtail roll showed up within minutes, followed shortly by the gyoza. Both were amazing. I'm usually not a dumpling fan, but these were lightly fried and crispy on a bed of sauce. The yellowtail roll was extremely flavorful compared to other places we've eaten. We barely finished those before our Shimogamo and Las Vegas rolls arrived. Nice presentation, and we were both amazed at how you could taste all the distinct flavors separately in the rolls. The touch of lemon in the Shimogamo roll was just perfect, and seemed to only come through at the end.   I'm no food critic, but eating here made me want to try to describe the food like one. The happy hour prices were awesome, and they're so efficient we were in and out in 35 minutes. And no pictures because we were hungry when we started and didn't want to stop until we were done!  We're going to be regulars now I think. Fantastic."}
{"text":"After having lots of Japanese food in New York, Tokyo and the in-laws house in Hasuda, I was knocked out. They do it right here. I never thought I could get this quality and style of food in AZ. Extra bonus is that it was 2 miles from my parent's house in Chandler! We will definitely go again when we come back to AZ."}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few sushi places including ones in Japan. Shimogamo is easily in my top three in Arizona. I rarely write reviews - but this place deserves it. Fresh cuts of fish, excellent service, great atmosphere & decoration in the restaurant.   This places has a certain level of authenticity that you simply don't find in Arizona (ie. don't look for it at Ra or Stingray). The sushi was crafted with care, the ingredients were of good quality, and they are inventive with certain rolls with out being ridiculous as you'll find with many places catering to more Americanized pallets.   Aside from your usual favorites, try the escolar nigiri and the izakaya style appetizers (sort of like Japanese tapas). I was impressed, and I thought the pricing was right (we paid about $32 + tip ea for two ordering 6 dishes total with beer). The value was definitely high.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for HH and everything was great. Definitely the best sushi I've had in the east valley! The regular prices were a little high so I'll probably stick with HH. The restaurant is pretty small but great service!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley at a great price. Zach is a great resource if you're not sure what to get and the quallity of the fish is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time I'm up in the Phoenix area I try and stop in for one meal.  Fish is always fresh and flavorful.  Service is pretty good.  The owner seats you but doesn't do much after that, and he's pretty quiet; not rude but no super friendly.  Two young guys are the sushi chefs.  The rolls are pretty good, but what does it for me here is the sushi.  They also have a really good bbq beef tongue.    If you happen to go between 5-7pm, they have a happy hour.  Some drinks, sushi, rolls, and appetizers at a discount.  Not a bad deal.  I've happened to dine twice during happy hour and ordered about half my meal off the HH menu and half off the regular menu.  Some fishes I crave aren't on the HH menu.  The atmosphere is laid back, and I've always gone dressed casual.  Some people do get dressed up but it's not necessary.    Try this place, it's legit!"}
{"text":"Named after the district in Kyoto that the owners are from, Shimogamo was our *best* Japanese meal in Phoenix during our one week there. It's a close call, with Nobuo and Yasu being quite comparable, but in the end, the umami palette was most refined at Shimogamo. The husband and wife team who own and run this place personally work everyday, ensure high standards for the overall dining experience; he works the dining area, and she is head chef in the kitchen. The highlight dishes were the Spanish Mackerel sashimi with the bones deep fried, the fine kelp soup with taroro, an outstanding delicate citrus miso dressing on the daikon radish & cucumber salad, the emaebi with spectacular deep fried heads, wild alaskan salmon and impressively fresh uni. Zach, the sushi chef, prepared everything very skillfully and was great to talk to."}
{"text":"Shimogamo ruined my life.  Why 5 stars you ask?  I can no longer eat sushi anywhere else.  Best sushi I've had anywhere.  And in Arizona no less!  The fish is so fresh - I usually prefer it on its own, not in a roll.  I feel like usually I order rolls because the fish isn't so great so I'd like some mayo concoction to hide the taste of the fish.  Not so here.  Escolar is the best.  Salmon is incredible.  Tuna - yum.  You can't go wrong.  There's a poke appetizer that they sometimes have that is outstanding.  Ambiance is pleasant, staff is nice, but the fish... oh the fish.  Any time I want sushi and I consider another place, I'm like, why?  Who are we kidding let's just go to Shimogamo.  Go - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The good:  Great sushi, very fresh and good variety of rolls, sushi, and cooked dishes/entrees. Ambiance is clean and upscale. Owner and staff are delightful.  For large groups, I recommend asking for the large table in back.  The sushi bar is also enjoyable for single or party of two.   Our favorite sushi restaurant in the east valley!  The bad:  It's a small place, so call ahead for reservations especially on weekend nights."}
{"text":"This place was clean with a classy look. It has a relaxing atmosphere and their servers were pleasant. I noticed from the first bite that their stock is VERY fresh. I believe that the gentleman behind bar is the owner. I noticed that he was quite skilled with a blade and quick with a dish. I was impressed with Shimogamo and I will be coming back soon. It would be a great place for a good first impression on a date."}
{"text":"Took 1 hr to prepare one sushi roll, two sushi and a grill fish. We were so hungry while we waited for the sushi chief to prepare our food. He was too relax and REALLY take his time. Overall took one and half hour to serve 3 dishes. The Uni sushi was NOT fresh and really sting. The others dishes were not worthed that price. Services were fine. But overall, very disappointed experience. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"my wife and I had dinner here just now and now we are sick. the chefs were very nice and good but they need to find a better place to work. the food quality is very cheap. this is the worst sushi I have ever had. the squid salad was fishy and left a nasty taste in our mouths. the fish was bad and smelled. even the avacado was bad. the seaweed that was used was both dry and chewy at the same time. got a spider role and that even stunk and taste fishy. the roles are half the size of actual roles and half way through the night they ran out of rice. my Wasabi that was given to me dried into a play dough in less than 45 seconds. I ordered ice water and got water from a tap, not even filtered. they used tap water for my wife's green tea and that was not even tea, they used a powder mix that stuck to her straw. those who say this place was good don't know what sushi is. smaller and more expensive does not better or higher quality. not ever going here again. don't blame the chefs because they are working with what the owners give them. one more thing for the owners... when you blowtorch your sushi, it just tast like gas fumes. what person does not know that uncooked fish captures the flavors of everything? why the hell are you gas lighting anything that has to do with sushi? totally wasted my money on poor food that I now am sick because of. avoid this place. it looks pretty but it comes with a price."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and decent prices. My only issue is that they have separate hours for lunch and dinner.  I had never seen a sushi place that closes mid day."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Some of the best sushi I've ever had.  Two words to describe everything: fresh and delicious!  Good service even when crowded, food may take a little while bit well worth the wait.!"}
{"text":"love this place. I'm Japanese and I'm picky about Japanese food.  I was a little surprised by non japanese sushi chefs but I trust the Japanese owner and the food was amazing. if you are on the budget, their happy hour has great deals!"}
{"text":"I have never posted before because normally I don't care that much but I am so mad I think this is the only way I might feel slightly better.   I really do not know how this place has 4 stars. Very deceiving. I have never been so mad after a meal. I was completely unsatisfied and disappointed. Writing this review is the only way that I can maybe calm down from pissing away $50 on terrible food.   We found it on YELP and it had good reviews and we figured it would be great, normally we do go to one of the cheaper rotating sushi places but honestly they kinda suck, but they cheap so who cares. But we had been going to another sushi place on Dobson and Ray that had been pretty good and thought we might try to see if Shimogamo was as good or better.   Well we got put in the back room with a large group that was very loud, mainly because the room was small but the group was also loud. Not a huge deal but a little annoying. What started to piss me off was how long it took to get the food. 45 Min for 2 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi. The sashimi was good, fresh and tasted great. The two rolls we got were Alaskan roll and Caterpillar Roll, those sucked. They were tiny and the eel in the Caterpiller Roll was chewy and I think it was just the skin. The rolls were worse than what you get at rotating sushi bars. Just 3x as much money.   This places blows and I am pissed. $50 for 2 rolls, sashimi and edamame. Thats a joke. I am still hungry and never going back. I really want to know what these people are thinking that gave it 5 stars. Please inform me on what I am missing. I just don't get it.   I hope this place closes and I will hold the grudge for as long as they hold my $50, so I think forever, I wish they would just give me my money back. It really is how little food I got for how much it cost that really pisses me off.   I hate you Shimogamo. I really hate you."}
{"text":"Just ate here a couple hours ago. Loved the food. Their happy hour menu had great prices and their normal prices are actually extremely competitive. Definitely way lower than most of the sushi places that I've eaten at in AZ.  Other than the sushi, we had gyoza, miso soup as a tempura don. The tempura don was an accident; I ordered a tempura roll and the waitress brought me a tempura don. However, it looked delicious and tasted great so I didn't complain.  The staff was very nice. The servers made sure our waters were always full and we were always helped quickly.  I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Shimogamo is one of those hidden gems of locally owned sushi restaurants and easily the best sushi and traditional home style Japanese food in the east valley.  I agree with another reviewer, the best way to eat here is to put yourself in the hands of the sushi chef and kitchen cook and let them take care of you.  If you don't mind spending a bit more, they are open to creating an omakase for $50-100+range or tweaking a lunch special to suit your taste.  Best bets for lunch: Assorted sushi - $19 (or $30-35) if you want to upgrade to uni, ama ebi, toro if available/  Daily bento box lunch - $8.50 Super cheap and amazing, true Japanese comfort food."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place! The chef is super cool and worked for Wolfgang Puck for a long time. I visit this place at least 5-6/year. High quality, great service, must visit. Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Best quality sashimi in the valley - not the place to come to for fried sushi rolls filled with cream cheese (these are not on the menu).  the owners are actually Japanesee and pride themselves on being a real Jaoanese restaurant.  Good happy hours - worth checking out    It''s a small restaurant that fills up fast - either reserve ahead of time or prepare to wait."}
{"text":"While visiting the area, I was taken to Shimogamo. This is now one of my favorite sushi spots. Just excellent."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend and it was NOT a good experience.  The food was ok but the service was horrible as soon as we walked in the door.  Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love coming to Shimogamo ! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Mr. Yoshi, the owner, is a super gentle-kind man, and focuses on quality of product and satisfaction of the customer. I have been coming here for years, and would not recommend any other sushi joint other than Shimogamo ! Seriously.... Shimogamo FOR THE WIN !!!!"}
{"text":"I proclaim that this is the best sushi/sashimi I have had thus far in Phx. I love sushi but its been so hard to find a place that has good enough fish where it reminds me of eating clouds (yes, good fish should taste more like clouds than fish!)  Anyways, the 5 stars is not because it is the best fish I have ever had, but it is the closest thing I have gotten in the state. The price is higher than other sushi bars in the area, but once you try it, you'll understand why. The quality of fish it top notch and the sushi chefs will even tell you which fish is in season. I first ordered a sake bomber (large beer and small sake) for $6.50. We ordered the Agedashi tofu and mixed veggie tempura. The tofu had a great soft, almost custard like, texture and tasted perfect. The tempura was good, nothing exciting to note. For entree, we got the Chirashi bowl, a spicy yellowtail roll, crazy roll, yellowtail sashimi and albacore sashimi. The chirashi was a very pleasant surprise with the amount of fresh cut fish but what solidified our decision for best sushi in AZ thus far, was the sashimi. The albacor was PERFECT and made me reminisce about the best sushi I had in Seattle, which did taste like clouds in my mouth. The dessert special of the day was crepes and they made my mouth very happy and was a perfect end to the meal.  Overall, with the Yelp Check-in and 10% off our bill, we got out of there for $81 including tax and tip. As a said before, not cheap but not a bad price considering all that was ordered.   Note: if you plan to come here on a Friday, its best to make a reservation because it can get crowded. Also happy hour is until 7pm."}
{"text":"After a mishap at another restaurant, I gave Shimogamo a call where the owner graciously agreed to cater to a rather large group of us at the last minute.  The food was fresh and delicious, and the place itself was very clean and beautiful.  There was an easy access to a full bar next door, and the service was amazing.  I highly recommend the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. Always fresh, innovative combinations. Ask for the head chef, Zack."}
{"text":"Shimogamo is a great place for sushi. So nice to have a small, quiet, friendly, and most importantly, authentic Japanese sushi restaurant in Phoenix.  No gimmicks, just good quality fish and no skimping on it either.  Al the head chef is a friendly guy who also cuts his fish with the best of them. The owner Yoshi and his wife  (she's usually busy in the kitchen) have a jewel in the ruff in Shimogamo.    For those fans of Japanese curry (I know it's not sushi!) mamasan makes it from scratch and it isn't on the menu. Try a katsu curry plate for dinner sometime. It will blow your tastebuds and mind! Fo real!  So next time you're in the mood for some buttery Toro or tasty Hamachi, roll on by Shimogamo"}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood sushi bar...think Cheers with raw fish and nicer decor.  Solid quality of fish with a nice selection of all the usual suspects.  Also good selection of cooked dishes for the non-raw eaters."}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets in AZ. However, small portions and very pricy. Just like back in Japan :p ... except we gotta tip and the tax rate is higher"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  Super fresh and authentic!  The chef's that work here are truly culinary artists, especially Zach.  My personal favorite is the crazy roll and the shrimp tempura is the best anywhere!  We decided to try the dessert tempura ice cream last night and was blown away!  It is drizzled with chocolate and covered with a pound cake prior to being tempura fried."}
{"text":"Yummy...Found so great sushi in Chandler.... We will definitely come again. BIG AND SPICY ROLL..."}
{"text":"Clean, yummy sushi! I had the crazy and California roll for :) hour. $7/$4. They were both great, staff was charming- I just wasn't sure who was kinda taking care of me, although I was sitting at the bar so.. I'll go here again"}
{"text":"Pros: *Quaint, clean, and classy ambiance in a small package.            *Fish cut well            *service friendly enough.  Cons: *Sushi rice was bland and undercooked.            *Some lesser ordered fish failed to deliver on freshness.             This is a small spot located / connected to C-Fu Gourmet in Chandler. Great things come in small packages, and I was excited to see what this charming little place had to offer. The place is clean, classy, and comfortingly familiar if you make a practice of seeking out the smaller guys.   Young kids behind the sushi bar, which I do my best not to sway my verdict...but does raise the question of experience. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the twenty something ASU kids are incapable, but the classic sushi chefs are apprenticed for years, and don't even get to touch the fish for the entire first year. They spend that first year learning how to perfect the rice. I raise this point NOT in order to boast about my familiarity with the art of sushi, but because the rice was Shimogamos greatest failing.   The order: All sushi (nigiri) *Mackerel (Saba), Salmon Roe (Ikura), Tuna (Maguro), Eel (Unagi), Albacore (Shiro Maguro), Yellowtail (Hamachi)  The fish itself in all fairness was cut well, portions are modest and not atypical but the freshness seemed to take a hit on some of the less commonly ordered fish. Mackerel is an extremely \"fishy\" fish and spoils quickly and usually served salt cured and washed in rice vinegar, but this process often leads to over curing it or just letting it hang out for a little longer than it should which seemed to be the case. We usually save the Unagi, a cooked eel, with a sweet teriyaki like sauce for last, it's like a sushi dessert, like the cherry on top, the wonderful last bite to end your meal, this was not the case. The Unagi was dry, old, stringy, and tendon-y...not as hoped. Even the eel sauce failed to cover this up, which lets be honest, is so rich that it often can.. All of this, and the rice. That poor rice, embarrassingly flaunted around in its undercooked, flavorless garb, passed off and billed as sushi rice. This was not sushi rice...this was your college roommate's rice cooker at work, and though the maguro, and shiro maguro cuts of fish were cut just fine (and presumably because of their high order rate, kept fresh) the failing of that rice pulled the rug right out from under them....literally.  It was so undercooked and poorly packed that it fell apart as you gingerly lifted them up with your chopsticks. The irony here is that the fresh fish was great, the minor missteps happened in the details, the cooked or brined fish, and of course the rice. If we had skipped the mackerel and unagi and ordered everything sashimi instead, this could be a glowing 3 or even a 4 star review.  Total for the order came to $70, plus tip. The company from behind the bar was friendly which always makes this kind of review more difficult. Perhaps the rice was just off that night. Guess we won't know unless we try again."}
{"text":"First and most importantly, this place has excellent, fresh sushi.  Tried the albacore sashimi, uni, salmon sashimi in a salad with truffle oil, vegas roll, and seaweed salad.  Only disappointing dish was the uni.  The rest were superb.  Total bill was under $75 including tip and 5 drinks (most everything was happy hour priced).  Friendly service at the sushi bar and a fun atmosphere.  Good date place."}
{"text":"We've searched for great sushi since moving to the area two years ago. Shimogamo has surprisingly good atmosphere hidden behind the generic strip mall. And the sushi is fresh and delicious. They have a great back room for large parties and an affordable, long happy hour."}
{"text":"We have been very impressed with Shimogamo having partaken of both their Happy Hour Specials and regular menus on two occasions.  The ingredients are always very fresh and I love being able to watch the chef cut, mold, roll, and create the tasty little packages.  The offerings on their HH menu are pretty standard as far as HH sushi goes, but you can taste the quality.  They also have fresh wasabi available for those not faint of heart.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  You can tell a lot of intention went into the execution of the decor.  It's cozy but still a little edgy and you certainly wouldn't know you were in Chandler while sitting on the leather benches surrounded by metal, ball chain curtains in the back room.    Their specials, while not inexpensive (which would be suspect when it comes to sushi anyway) are delicious.  We tried the bacon wrapped scallops and, I mean, c'mon!  BACON wrapped scallops!  It seems like many reviewers compare any sushi here in the Valley to sushi they have eaten in places that are not land-locked deserts.  Look, your meal had to be plucked from an ocean (at closest several hundred miles away), packed, and flown here.  Seriously, People--that's comparing apples to oranges.    Shimogamo is definitely in my top 3 of Phoenix-area Sushi and I'm thrilled they are so close to home."}
{"text":"Second visit at Shimogamo Overall great quality fish,  the atmosphere is classy, the service pleasant, but a tiny bit slow. Which it's not a big deal, I just make sure that I'm not in a rush when I go. It's always better to wait a little more and to be happy with your plate than the opposite."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I've ever had! My face here is the caterpillar roll. Love the presentation and atmosphere is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Phoenix area.Lobster salad appetizer is amazing.  Sushi is always high quality and their specials are always worth the $."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ. Hands down. The chefs are knowledgeable and care about their product and craft."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Thanks to chef Al for great conversation, food and suggestions. We felt right at home from the beginning here. The atmosphere is sheik and intimate.  The tempura was perfectly crisp and light, the fish all incredibly fresh (shrimp was killed/prepared right in front of us fresh), rolls were truly an explosion of flavor in every bite and the dessert (Japanese crepes) were heavenly.  We can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in the Phoenix area.  Continued excellent service.  Always great recommendations from the staff."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of rolls and the sushi is very fresh. Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"So I love the food here but just got told on a Friday at 5:20pm that I had to leave because they were booked for the whole night. It's a small sushi joint. Why are the taking reservations?!?!?!  First come first served."}
{"text":"Shimogamo has absolutely wonderful sushi!!! This has to be one of the best places to get sushi in Phoenix. Shimogamo has very fresh sashimi, some interesting rolls, and a nice sake list. This small restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere and competent servers!!! What's not to love at Shimogamo?!?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Shimogamo is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix!  Happy hour is awesome!  Waitresses are awesome!  Rolls, sushi, tuna poke, o-toro, gyoza, you name it, I've probably had it.  It's fantastic!  We used to go every week, but are recently trying to save money.    My two tips are: make a reservation!  It's a small restaurant, which is a huge benefit.  And from all the times I have gone it looks like there's a lot of regulars, including myself.  This means that it fills up quickly.  We started making reservations and it's wonderful.  Your table is set and ready to go with menus when you walk in the door... On time!  Second tip: Go on Thursdays, Fridays, or Saturdays.  We think they get their fish shipment in on Wednesday or maybe Thursday morning. Also, I like the chefs on a lot more on those days.  Better cuts of fish, look, and overall taste."}
{"text":"Quite seriously the best sushi in Arizona! The place is small and has limited seating. You will want to make a reservation. They do have a large table that seats up to 12 people. The Panko roll is my all time favorite. Order it last as it can be really spicy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kind of hidden, tucked back in a strip mall -- it's located katty-korner across from Lee Lee's Oriental supermarket.  I was dying to try it and was totally satisfied!  It is not a huge restaurant and reservations are recommended. Our appetizers were edamame and the beef tongue, which was sliced very thinly and salt/pepper seasoned.  We had several rolls and nigiri, and our favorite was the oyster roll.  The seafood was very fresh and well-prepared.  I'd have to say it was the best sushi I've ever eaten. Service was swift and efficient.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"For my first visit here, I'm only giving this place 3 stars. This is a small little sushi place, so not really a place for large groups, but great for small intimate groups. My only concern, either way, is that it's not very private in the conversation department. It's that small....A little background music would have made this perfect--but this place did not deliver.  Service was ok, i suppose. Our orders were simple, and we had water to drink, so not much to do--plus there were only two of us. The only saving grace was this: i wasn't so hungry i was about to gnaw my arm off (it took forever to get our food and we ordered 2 *simple* rolls a piece) and that i had great company filled with entertaining conversation. If those two things not had been factors in this dinner equation, this could have been much worse.  I will say, however, the sushi was pretty good. Fresh fish, unique combinations, and it kept well for take out. I had to bring dinner home for someone and got the thumbs up from them. Seeing as how it was over an hour before i showed up with it after they brought it to me, that's a good sign, lol.  I will definitely go back if given the chance, but it's not a place that is high on my radar. If the atmosphere was better i might feel differently."}
{"text":"Horrible experiences. Twice I have gone to the restaurant and has been refused a table, with the owner stating that there was no available seats when clearly there were. He said those were reserved for upcoming reservations. I was told both times by other patrons that he does not like to seat  single people at the sushi bar. I will be definitely taking my business elsewhere. He is most definitely not the only sushi bar in town!"}
{"text":"Walked in to a fairly empty dining area and bar, was told since our party of 2 didn't have reservations we wouldn't be seated for over half an hour. Not sure if this is because they just didn't feel like working, or making $, or what exactly. Pretty disappointing. With all the great sushi in the area, was able to take our business to House Modern Sushi- which  was great!"}
{"text":"We must have tried at least 4 or 5 other sushi places in the Chandler area before finding this gem. My favorite is the salmon nigiri, always so smooth and buttery. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. I have Celiac and am on a gluten free diet, so I often request that my boyfriend's order is plated separately from mine, and they are always willing to accommodate. Never been glutened eating here either, so it's one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"Kemta and Al were my sushi chefs last night at Shimogamo and they were very friendly and hospitable. I finished work last night around 8:30PM and was hungry for sushi. They close at 9PM Mon-Thurs.  They welcomed me in, let me know it was no problem to serve me and were so great about it. What great attitudes they have."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi, friendly staff, and if you're lucky you might get some of their unusual specials."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour.  Got the crazy, las vegas, spicy yellowtail, california roll, assorted tempura and tempera ice cream for dessert all for $40.  All the rolls were delish, but relatively small compared to other sushi places.  Tempura was more on the greasy side, but had a good variety (shrimp, carrots, green chili, onion, green bean and eggplant).  Tempura ice cream was great.  They give you 1 green tea and 1 vanilla covered with a lightly pound cake and tempura batter.  Only reason why I gave it a 4 star is the size of the rolls, other than that great tasting sushi!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time Saturday evening with a group of 8 people! What an exceptional place!! The service was great, we tried all kinds of sushi rolls, sashimi  and various appetizers. I've not dined at many places where I would actually order any of the things I tried again, they were ALL that good. We were in the back dining room, due to the size of our party and the atmosphere was nice and contemporary. Our friends who'd dined there before said you must have reservations. It is my new favorite sushi place and will be headed there again next week."}
{"text":"This place has the taste!  Flew into Arizona for the first time and had been to 4 different places and Shimogamo is the best so far. The shoyu is better than most other places I had and if you eat sushi like me you'd know that a good shoyu is essential to sushi eating.   The fish were fresh and delicious. I'd definitely visit this place again when I have the chance."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  Definitely hard to find initially but it's there, next to Cfu gourmet on the right.  Not a lot of signage.  Had the albacore, escolar, salmon skin hand roll and crazy roll.  All awesome!  Ambience ok, cool loungy music.  Love these hidden gems!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, it was a point of great concern that I wouldn't be able to find a quality \"go to\" sushi spot living in the valley. After digging around for recommendations I arrived at Shimogamo. My expectations were met and then some! My friend and I were seated at the bar with Zach, who was quick with recommendations and great conversation. The rest of the staff was warm and inviting and we felt right at home. I'm pretty simple with my sushi, I generally prefer sashimi or nigiri only and stay away from most intricate or fancy rolls. The flavors were fresh, clean, and delicious. We tore through orders of Halibut, Salmon, Saba(mackerel), tuna, kanpachi, amaebi, and more. Everything was good to to great and some dishes were just outstanding. The miso soup was solid, and the Sapporo was plentiful. We didn't order any of the more creative rolls but we did spy a few diners ordering them and watched the preparation of several and they looked excellent as well. Placed reservations for my next visit before I even left."}
{"text":"I used to eat here when I first moved to Chandler and didn't have an option if I wanted to eat sushi.  The quality is solid and the service is pretty good.  The problem is that the size of the nigiri, sashimi and maki are laughably TEENY TINY.  On top of that, the price is exponentially opposite.  My fiance and I would go and eat up $60-$70 worth of sushi and we would be getting the check and heading to In and Out.  Not because we're pigs (both of our BMI are under 19), but because the amount is so tiny.  I have no idea how they justify charing half of your mortgage to eat there, it's not THAT good.  I would pay $70/piece to eat if Chef Nobu was cooking.  Skip this place and head to Sushi In Motion in downtown Chandler (see my review).  And if you're tight on budget and could careless about service, head to Ken Sushi."}
{"text":"I tend to be a bit of a snob when it comes to sushi. Rarely have I been blown away by the sushi restaurant. I find typically that the sushi is ok but nothing special.   However, this was not the case at Shimogamo. Everything was quite fresh so much so that they were out of several of the items we wanted. We tried several of their specialty items and were quite impressed with each. I highly recommend the miso marinated salmon and the tsunami roll were amazing.   I ordered two items that are almost staples in my sushi: caterpillar roll and unagi. The unagi was so fresh and fabulous. I did not add my normal extra eel sauce because of the incredible taste of the eel itself. The caterpillar roll tasted good but really paled in comparison to everything else!   The staff was quite attentive and helpful. I never had to wait for a refill of my drink.   The atmosphere is nice. I like the simplistic decor and light music.   I will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Just love this place! I dont get over much anymore but when I do it is consistently amazing , clean, and wonderful friendly service- not to mention the food is FABU! Yoshi (owner) always does a great job making sure everyone is taken care of and will participate in your celebrations on occasion. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Consistently the best sushi in the Valley! Great specials too. The dumpling appetizer is a treat!"}
{"text":"What you should know! This place is TINY!!! and you most definitely need a reservation!  We stopped by around  4.  Were told they didn't reopen until 5, or 6 (and the guy was ultimate hipster SNOOTY!, and didn't specify we would need res.  Perhaps we didn't look ''hip' enough!)We thought NP and did our grocery shopping at Lee-Lee's.  Got back around 6 to find zero availability!  Owner was the epitome of both dignity and customer conciliation: which is one of the reasons we will (with reservations!) return.  That and the fact the food looked PHENOMENAL!!!! So, full stars even though we have not yet sampled.  We walked a few feet next door and had a lovely meal at the much lauded C-Fu Gourmet."}
{"text":"We have been in search of a good sushi restaurant. We finally found it! Delicious fresh sashimi and nicely crafted rolls! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out on a Saturday night and was amazed to find that they actually have happy hour EVERY day from 5-7! Their hours are a little weird though...they're closed from 2-5 daily...what if I'm craving sushi??  We got there around 5:15 and were the first and only party there until a couple arrived a little later...it's a small place, no more than 10 tables and a sushi bar, of course. The sushi guys were hispanic and talking in Spanish the whole time when they weren't checking to see how our sushi was or asking if we needed anything else...not too professional and made me wish we'd sat at a table instead.   So...started off with edamame...cant go wrong there, right? Uh, it was overcooked (believe it), and I felt as though it was a childs portion...  The baked oysters were absolutely amazing but they were served with a barbeque sauce....not a fan of the combo...but they were soooo good just by themselves so I managed.  The crazy roll, shrimp tempura, and eel & cucumber rolls were all on happy hour and all really fresh and yummy. Pretty standard though. I almost feel like I should go back and give them another chance but don't really wanna drop another $36 on it..."}
{"text":"This is the best hidden gem in Chandler!! Best sushi I have ever had! It is fresh and prepared right in front of you! They display the fish they are using, so you know it hasn't been sitting out all day. You can see how tender and fresh it looks! The service is quick! You would never find it if you weren't informed about it. The inside is tiny, but it's never too packed in there. You can sit up at the bar and the sushi chef is really knowledgeable and enjoys talking about the sushi with you as well! There is a back room for private events. I found out about Shimogamo for a birthday party I attended in the back room, and it is intimate, but not too restricted! Try the best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Best I've found in the East Valley. Puts Kona to shame and better than Ra. Sushi chef Zach is great.  The sauce that comes on  the Shimogamo Roll and the fried gyoza is amazing.  Best roll is the lollipop roll which is wrapped in cucumber."}
{"text":"Shimogamo ha saikouda!  The sushi was good, I had the shimogamo and Vegas roll, hamachi and creamy hotate.  They had a Kobe beef roll and a delicious looking okonomiyaki that was served at the other table... Next time I will definitely try those. I wanted to grab some standard sushi because the sushi chef was fantastic. I've watched sushi chefs my whole life, really really good ones, Japanese born and bred, through all the rigor and tests... In Hawaii and japan. The young man behind the bar crafting the sushi has the talent to go quite far. I think his name was Seth, but I'm not sure. I will get it next time. If you ever read this: you are good! Keep practicing and I think you will make a great ryoricho one day, head your own restaurant. I will bring you business! Just one thing.. Learn the Japanese pronunciation!  Fish was pretty fresh, i inspected closely! The hamachi had a hint of bitter orange, I found out later there is an orange-hamachi, that must be where that came from. Miso-mayo is a good aioli, very few places use it, normally I need to just make it at home. My compliments, I will be back later, and I will tell everyone I know about shimogamo. The sushi bar not Kyoto!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going here for sushi and Japanese food.  It's a small, cozy place and it's not easy to get a seat on Friday and Saturday nights because it's soo good.  Good food and a great vibe."}
{"text":"We are from Los Angeles and eaten at numerous sushi restaurants there and here in Arizona. We have driven all over Phoenix, Gilbert, Mesa, Chandler and Glendale. For fresh good quality fish this is the place you want to go. They fly in their fish fresh several times a week.   We had yellowtail, amberjack, escolar, live ama ebi, uni, eel cooked in house, albacore, toro.  We also had a yellowtail hand roll with fresh lemon it was amazing. Everything was so fresh I forgot for a bit we were in AZ. This place is the real deal.  Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Cons:  rice is a little on the wet side; a little pricey.   Pros:  fresh fish, shimogamo ribeye with dipping sauce, great upscale ambiance.  Friendly service  So-so:  Kumamoto oysters"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievably amazing; it is perhaps my favorite sushi place in Chandler! The meals are fantastic as well. Their potato salad is some of the best I have had, which is interesting given the other food items on the menu. A single complaint would be that the sushi making process is a little slow, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I never used to be a fan of sushi. Then, my wife convinced me to try it in Hawaii because it was so good. I was hooked! When we came back to AZ, we found Shimogamo and we've been coming back regularly for their sushi. It's very fresh, delicious and we've always had a good experience there. Service has almost always been efficient and we've always been able to get in and out quick on most occasions. Try their cappucino jelly dessert. Very different and quite delicious.  They have been getting very busy lately, and looks like reservations are needed for Friday and Saturday evenings - about a week in advance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing... getting good sushi isn't hard. Getting good sushi cheap... that is hard! The owner is great, and always welcoming and the time to be there is their crazy long happy hour. Great for a group as they have an awesome back room for you and yours."}
{"text":"4.5/5 as far as food concern.  Love the place decoration and clean design. Makes me think of going to a restaurant  in bigger city. I cannot remember what I ordered because it's been awhile now but I loved everything we ordered. If you love sushi and trying to find a good place in AZ. This place deserved to be visited. The only reason I didn't go to this place that often before was because I live far away.   ** review is based prior visits before my plant based diet**"}
{"text":"Great food. Very casual atmosphere. We were there for 2.5+ hours and felt at home. Lovely bacon scallops, yummy Vegas roll, ribs, Escobar, and many more...so amazing! Don't be scared by the location. Nice happy hour from 5-7pm. Can't wait to go back. First of many."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner for sushi. The tuna is okay , hamachi is also okay with overall quality is average. The teriyaki is below average ..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been going to this place for 3 years as regulars around twice a month. Great sushi but horrible customer service. The owner named Yoshi is rude always frowning. He has a terrible attitude and doesn't give a crap if you have been a loyal customer for years. He has his sushi chefs talking about their person lives the whole time you are trying to enjoy a meal. A little tiny whole in the wall and if you want to eat here you better make a reservation it only sits around 20 people. Yoshi the owner will only take reservations so be careful. I went on a Sat at 5 p.m when there wasn't one person in the place and the owner turned us away without a reservation. It seemed a little like discrimination. I will never be going back. Hana, Squid Ink, Masa and even Saki Bomber are better places for so many reasons for ex. customer service, more seating and more affordable sushi.  The quality at other places is the same without the hassle!"}
{"text":"I'm going to revise my original post after going on the maricopa.gov restaurant inspection list. It appears Shimogamo has a few citations for not keeping their fish at the appropriate temperature of below 41 degrees. In fact, these citations say it was up to 54 degrees.  As someone who checks the Maricopa.gov site regularly on these restaurant checks, I  know that there are some citations that are really stupid (for example - they got cited for not putting the \"consuming raw fish etc is bad for your health\". Duh, it's a sushi restaurant. But, raw fish storage to me is important, since that's how many people get sick from sushi restaurants. As much as I liked this place, I am going to hold off a couple months until the next inspection to make sure this isn't re-occuring ."}
{"text":"exceptional albacore salad and white tuna sashimi.  Rolls were prepared in a timely manner, looked as good as they tasted."}
{"text":"I liked it here! The food was pretty great.  I ordered the cucumber roll, veggie roll, and eel/cucumber roll. I love my cucumber, obviously! The rolls were a little small but they were tasty. I wish the rice had a little more seasoning, but it was definitely not bad at all!  I also ordered  the sunomono salad, which had shredded crab meat in it as well as some seaweed. It was very yummy but maybe a little too much vinegar. No big deal!  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura, calamari and chicken cutlet. He was not a fan of the calamari - it was a little tough and way spicy. That's okay - the rest of the food he said was delicious!  Overall it was a little pricey for what we got ($56 for two people), but it was great. I'd recommend them to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about sushi and there are very few places where I will eat it.  I am particularly suspicious of restaurants that offer only a few varieties of fish and include mayonnaise in most of their preparations.  The is our absolute favorite spot in town for sushi.  The food is delicious, innovative, and impeccably fresh.  The atmosphere is also very sleek and attractive.  This is definitely a great spot for a nice date.  Although the chef certainly deserves credit, I think that the owner -- who stands guard over the dining room and sushi bar -- is a major factor in this restaurant's quality and consistency."}
{"text":"These guys do a great job. One of the top 5 sushi joints in the valley, and top 2 for overall value. Lots of items on the special board, great service, and reasonable pricing. I'd give them 5 stars if the kitchen did as good of a job as the sushi chefs. If you're looking for \"real\" sushi (not 100+ special rolls) such as great fish, oysters, and Japanese cuisine this is your spot in the valley. If you want better you'll need to pony up the money (2x $) for shinbay or Roma Akor. Great job shimagamo."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant, with excellent Sushi. Love the small quaint atmosphere and the personal service. The Oyster/Uni shooters are awesome. Go here and you will not be disappointed. I've had almost everything on the menu and it is great. Shimogamo roll, tempera shrimp, salmon roll, tuna roll, live scallop hand roll...well..you get the point. Delish!  Restroom situation is a little odd, you go next door to the huge Chinese Restaurant and use theirs...no big deal, just different. You love the food."}
{"text":"Went here while traveling on business and was not disappointed.    We arrived at the end of the happy hour so the prices on our first round of sushi was GREAT!  The Citrus Roll is amazing - so unique!  The spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail were also very good.  If you like a lot of heat, you'll love the spicy Vegas roll - it is topped with a jalepeno slice.  We had the spicy dumplings for an appetizer and they were also very good.    The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that the service on our second round order of rolls took a really long time - to the point we thought they forgot about us.  This was surprising because the first round was brought out in a very timely manner.  The wine list is not extensive but the Merlot we chose was a nice one.  A co-worker ordered the Chardonnay and said it was also really good.  Overall, if I'm back in Chandler I will definitely go to this restaurant again.  The sushi was excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here again...Man this place is exclusive!   Make sure to get a reservation on weekends. The Sashimi was excellent. The big Sapporo beer?  Even better."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am impressed with the Sushi/Sashimi/Rolls.  That is not why I'm giving them 2 stars.  My wife and I dined there a few times and the sushi was fresh and the service was good.  I am, however, very annoyed at the fact that they advertise takeout and I have called on two occasions and was denied my order.  The first time was last summer and they said that it was too hot outside.  Really?!?!?  I called tonight and they said that they were too busy.    I strongly suggest that the restaurant inform their customers of the possibility that they will refuse to take an order."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation of a friend. Sorry. First noticed that the sushi  was about 35% more expensive than many places we have had. Second, the sushi was real small. You could see through the salmon on our Sake nigiri :-(. Their tempura vegetable tray was good that's why the 2 stars. Will not be coming back here. There are many places in the valley for sushi that you will get more bang for your buck than here."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  After going to several sushi places in the Valley, in my book, this place ranks as the best in terms of atmosphere, food quality, affordability, and service.  Happy hour from 5-7 every day is the best time to come.  The quality of the food, from the tempura to the miso soup to the sushi itself are incredible.  I paid around $60 with the 10% check-in discount for a group of 5, mostly ordering items from the happy hour menu, which is extremely affordable given the quality of food.  I would happily come here again and bring my friends to try out some of the more adventurous menu items like the Uni and Toro."}
{"text":"went to this place tonight wanting a nice japanese meal. we were turned away because accdg to them they are fully booked. we asked if we can order to go and basically the guy just waved his hand and we were 'shooed' away like flies. the party before us did not have reservations but they were taken in- i guess because they were dressed nicely. i guess its our fault coming from a swim meet, we did not think to go back to the hotel and change into nice clothes. only reason we went there was because of the nice yelp reviews. i guess they have good food, manners are lacking though!"}
{"text":"We don't particularly like Japanese food but saw online that they offer several American dishes and decided to give it a try based on stellar reviews.  So we called ahead for reservations at their 5:00 PM opening and were told we would \"have to be done in 1 hour\" because they had 18 reservations at or around 6:00.  That sounded a bit rude but we eat fast and decided that wouldn't be a problem, so we made the reservation and headed over.  You just don't go to a Japanese restaurant for American or Americanized food...that was our mistake and we take full responsibility for that.  We started with the pan fried dumplings (pot stickers in Chinese restaurants) and the Chicken Kara-Age, which were both very good. My wife ordered the breaded pork cutlet, which was OK, while I ordered the prime rib-eye, which was a major disappointment...the meat was served cold and very tough and flavorless.  Again, the Japanese food may very well be 5 star but we would not recommend this restaurant for it's American/Americanized food."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN THE VALLEY! Cute place, delicious fresh food! The price is not bad at all."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and was not at all impressed my first visit. I would've given this spot 2 stars based on that visit. The service was just okay and the sushi was very bland and not cold enough.   My 2nd visit was significantly better. The service still was not good, however the sushi was much better. The Citrus Roll was excellent and I highly recommend trying that roll.   My boyfriend and I were sat in the back room on this visit and it was nice in that room - minus the creepy painting on the wall of a torture room or something?? That painting is hideous and grosses me out. It looks like a room from a Saw movie. Who wants to looks at that while they eat raw fish?  Anyway, the 2nd visit was much better but still I'm not sure if I will be back. I hate it when restaurants are inconsistent in regards to their food. Service I can understand, but I think the food should always be consistent."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here. Whenever I have a day off, it is my go to place! Best in the neighborhood, you won't be disappointed. As always, friendly, of course!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sushi, sashimi selection and sake. Blackened cod was succulent. My only slight disappointment was it was hard to get the attention of the sushi chef as he was too busy gossiping with regulars. A bit loud too!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. An older man sat us down at our table, with papers on it. Didn't even say hello. He was rude and not friendly. He came to take our drink order and I asked if they had root beer he rudely said \"no, beer, what?\" So he brought me orange juice which he chose for me. I got up and left before my drinks even came. Took my money and business down the street. They really need to work on hiring better employees. I will not go back again! Went on a Sunday at around 5pm."}
{"text":"I've been here once,  during lunch.   It is a pretty small space,  so don't come in groups of 6+ or you'll sit separately.   The sushi is made and given to you when ordered.  I'm giving it four stars because of the portion size."}
{"text":"I'm changing my rating.  We have returned to this place several times. And the sushi is top notch for az. This is now our go to place for sushi in the east valley."}
{"text":"I frequent many sushi bars in the area and I would not recommend this place at all. My usual meal at every sushi restaurant is a chirashi bowl and a spicy tuna roll. A chirashi bowl is a bowl of mixed sashimi on a bed of rice. For me it is always a good way to determine just how good the sushi restaurant because this bowl has almost every type of sashimi you find on their menus - albacore, tuna, salmon, squid, egg, yellowtail, tuna belly, fish eggs, etc.  Now concerning Shimogamo, not only were the portions very small for both the chirashi bowl and the spicy tuna roll, there was absolutely no flavor in the fish, neither did it look fresh. They charge high prices here -the chirashi bowl was $25, the spicy tuna roll was $6.25. The rice in the chirashi bowl was also dry, hard, and not cooked properly to be sushi rice  I would recommend going to Sakana, specifically the location in ahwatukee. Portions are good sized, the fish is fresh, has flavor, and prices are reasonable. A chirashi bowl at Sakana is $16 while a spicy tuna roll is about $6. Also they are always consistent here, which is a huge factor in Japanese restaurants.   If you don't believe give Shimogamo a shot, Sakana in ahwatukee a shot, and then you'll realize how much time, money, and effort you've wasted."}
{"text":"I have no clue why I was expecting zen-like music or a Japanese bamboo deer scarer water fountain... but instead found jazz music with 2 non-Asian sushi chefs.  I shouldn't judge, I make an awesome spaghetti carbonara.  Ask the chef what he'd recommend for the day off the white board.  The sushi & sashimi is uber fresh and probably the best in the E.V., with the kampachi (Hawaiian yellowtail) being the fave... delicate taste and firm flesh (doesn't mushy fish gross you out??).  Next time I'd save my $ on the toro to get more kampachi!  The rolls were great, Big & Spicy and Futomaki!  That said, I'd stay away from the panko anything.  We did the assorted platter -...worst.deep.fried.Japanese.ever.  The oil tasted old or the panko off (is that even possible?), but we had the gamut of salmon, pork chop, vegs, a shrimp and oyster... it was just plain bad.  You're going here for sushi and sashimi, stick with it!"}
{"text":"This spot hands down the best sushi spot in town. Absolutely love this spot. The service, the food, the atmosphere is great! Sad I won't be living in Chandler anymore but I will for sure be back to visit!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Who knew the desert can host quality fish. Really great food with reasonable pricing. Japanese owned and ran Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"this is a good sushi spot. get to know the owner, yoshi, and he will treat you like royalty.  regarding the comments on price: hello! this is sushi not a hamburger, you should expect to pay for good quality. its raw fish. you dont want to be getting bargain fish when its raw. the prices are in line with the costs of good quality fish and service.  regarding portion size: this is sushi not a big meal. the portions here are correct."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi with a very nice happy hour menu.  The service at the sushi bar was impressive and very personal.  We enjoyed our time here and will definetly be back a number of times."}
{"text":"Very disappointed there was no sushi. Food was meh. We got ignored most of the night.  Oriental people came in 40 mins after us and got served before us."}
{"text":"The sushi is good but the service was EXTREMELY disappointing. We tried this place for the first time on a Friday night. We sat down at a 2 person table by the sushi bar to look at the menu, and we couldn't even think because the sushi chef was so loud. One of the first things I heard him shout was his experience with \"hookers and blow\". He made several more loud references to crack and cocaine throughout our dining experience, which, in my opinion, is tasteless. Keep that between you and your buddies after hours.  The sushi chef was loud the entire time, and he was talking to the couple at the bar who were right in front of him (no need to shout). We placed our order and proceeded to wait..and wait..and wait. 30 minutes later the sushi chef shouted out our order to the kitchen (for the cooked items). He had the order in front of him the whole time. Meanwhile several more patrons show up and sit at nearby tables and the sushi bar. Within minutes the people at the sushi bar had rolls and appetizers. About 40 minutes after placing our order we finally got part of our order.   Long story short: great place if you are the party that's getting preferential treatment. If not, be prepared to wait (and bring earplugs)."}
{"text":"Exquisitely amazing quality raw fish! Creatively designed items.  Nice and cozy.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good sushi.Training new chef while we ate who just starred at us with no  conversation.Outside of the creepy factor of that...enjoyed my Baja California plate and spicy yellow tail rolls."}
{"text":"The last thing you're expecting to hear when you walk into this traditional Japanese restaurant is Dr Dre but I continue to be amazed by this place. Flawless!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Server who basically ignored us to chat with friend behind the sushi bar about  trying to get laid."}
{"text":"Shimogamo has the best sushi I've found in the Valley. Make a reservation - it's small, which probably helps them keep the excellent quality of both food and service."}
{"text":"Great place!  Atmosphere is very relaxing....EXCELLENT food...and great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the fish selection was really, really nice. The sushi rolls weren't overly complicated. Great, fresh ingredients in tasty combinations. I was really impressed!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and ordered off the happy hour menu. Definitely the best sushi I've had in AZ! It was priced well for the quality and tasted very fresh. We got the spicy tuna rolls, Las Vegas rolls, and Crazy rolls."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Amazing food & prices were cheap as well, happy hour choices were good too!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we've had in the Phoenix area. Everything was excellent. We sat at the sushi bar because we didn't have a reservation. Only a few tables at this place. Quiet, chill atmosphere. Even at the bar we could have a private conversation.  We had pan fried gyoza, and 4 signature rolls. There is a distinct taste to a \"cheap\" sushi place. You could taste the quality here. Everything was excellent. The big 'n spicy roll was spicy and delicious. Our favorite was the fresh finish of the citrus roll. If you like sushi this place is a must go."}
{"text":"I kinda don't get the ratings on this one.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly, but the food is very mediocre.  The quality of the fish is so-so and the portions aren't really all that great.  On top of that the prices are outrageous.   I've been here twice now,just to give it a chance, and I probably wouldn't go back.  Really- you can get better sushi at a MUCH better price at plenty of places near here."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I was really impressed with this place the first time I came but the second time was a different story. I have never felt so second class citizen til I came here. The guy at the front was so rude when I walked in (pretty sure he was the owner). He was more concerned with the white party of six walking from the parking lot than the person standing there in front of him asking for a table for 4. He ignored me the first time I walked in. Then when he finally acknowledged me he pointed to a table by the door and said that was the only table he had. I looked around and there were literally 2 other tables that were open. He seemed upset that he had to tell me where the bathroom was which by the way is in a separate restaurant next door. It was awkward walking in there because the people were like who the hell are you? He didn't even tell me where the bathroom was, I walked around a giant restaurant looking for it. Horrible experience, I will never come back and will tell all my friends and family not to go there!"}
{"text":"Great, clean Japanese food! My brother who is a sushi fanatic loved this place! Tried all different types of sushi and they were excellent"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! Actually best I have found in the area. I would suggest making a reservation before hand"}
{"text":"Well, I just shelled out $75 for a very mediocre dinner.  I should have listened to that little voice in my head that said no, but my adventurous nature told me to try new places much louder.  I haven't had a good sushi experience here yet, after reading the reviews on Yelp I hoped this would be one.  I got the chirashi ($25), which is my go to dish.  You generally get a good variety of sashimi and can gauge a place's quality without ordering everything on the menu.  I have only one request with my chirashi (because its chef's choice you can't really pick and choose) but its very important and I am very specific about it.  Do not put mackerel in it.  I hate mackerel.  There are plenty of other choices that are similarly priced, so cost is not a valid argument.  I seriously hate mackerel.  Well guess what was staring up out of my bowl? You guessed it, a big ol' fat slab of disgusting mackerel.  I seriously had to stop myself from throwing it at the chef, because I really wanted to.  I wanted to go all Gordon Ramsay on the bastard.  What if I was allergic instead of just grossed out?! Seriously.  People do ask you to leave things out for those kinds of reasons as well.  That being said, the rest of my chirashi was pretty good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have.  I was too irritated.  My husband was nearly done eating by the time they brought out my food, which didn't do much for my mood.  We ordered some nigiri and some rolls to try also.  The tamago was good but poorly constructed and fell apart on the way to my mouth.  The tuna roll was good.  The tempura shrimp roll had so much mayonnaise oozing out of it that there was no way I was going to touch that.  In fact, if I had seen that before I ordered dinner we wouldn't have ordered anything else.  Mayonnaise.  Ugh.  Another sushi fail on the books.  I won't be back.  They have all of my money they're going to get.  Sorry if I've insulted anyone, but tonight you deserve it."}
{"text":"Wow! Since moving from CA to Arizona it has been hard to find good affordable sushi. Great thing we decided to give this place a try. Quality rolls, good prices, and even better happy hour! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, the sushi is awesome! Go here for happy hour and get a great deal on some awesome sushi. If you order the happy hour specials you can have a nice meal for about $20 but it is easy to get tempted and spend more.."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had since moving to Arizona. A nice Japanese man took our reservation and we were helped by a friendly man (mike?) behind the counter, preparing the sushi exquisitely. A hidden jewel!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, clean, delicious!! And happy hour is great! This place is right next to C-Fu Gourmet Chinese restaurant. You enter right at the sushi bar. It's got a cool contemporary vibe. It's small but not cramped. There is a back room for large parties. There were 2 guys manning the sushi bar and I have to say, I have never received my order to my table so fast! But it was not sloppily made, they were as nice and eye catching as any other sushi bar I've been to. The place was not dead either fairly busy for 6pm happy hour. I'd say these guys are very efficient in their work. We tried 3 rolls off the happy hour list. The Vegas, spicy yellowtail, and the crazy roll. All you could tell the fish was fresh and full of flavor. Yet these rolls were not heavy and super filling like some sushi places seem to make them. We also got the pork gyoza and the sushi escolar both were great! We definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"As a wise person once told me, you can judge a sushi restaurant by the quality of its sushi rice. In the case of Shimogamo, their sushi rice has a good balance of moisture and rice vinegar without being overly sticky. They offer a large variety of sashami and of the fish I have tried, their fish quality is good especially considering the price. I love their albacore tataki salad, which is actually a better value than buying the albacore alone.   Shimogamo excels at their selection of appetizers. They offer some Japanese dishes that can be hard to find at most other sushi places, such as BBQ beef tongue or fried oyster. While I haven't had the beef tongue yet, I have tried their fried oyster, beef carpaccio, and dynamite lobster. They were all very good, which leaves me optimistic for the other appetizers.   When my wife and I eat here, we generally order quite a few dishes and spend about $20-25 per person. While it is easy to find far cheaper sushi places in the Phoenix area, this place offers a higher quality and more interesting variety that makes the price well worth it. Shimogamo is quickly becoming one of our regular favorites."}
{"text":"I've heard it said that there's no such thing as good seafood in Arizona. While I can certainly understand the logic behind this reasoning, a worthy and notable exception has been found in Shimogamo.  Shimogamo has carried my personal label of \"Best Sushi in Arizona\" for well over a year now. I've tried plenty of other sushi restaurants, including a number that have been touted as \"the best\" by friends, but Shimogamo consistently wins out in my personal opinion.  The restaurant wins a five star review across all relevant categories of scoring, too: it's not just the food that's outstanding; it's the service, the consistent quality, the ambiance.  I could still recount every detail from the very first time I ever stepped foot in Shimogamo. I fact, it was Yelp that led me there! VERY rarely does ANY place make such a distinct and pleasurable impression.  Every time I've ever walked through the front door, I have been calmly and kindly greeted by the owner. He is quiet and polite and seems somewhat disaffected, but in a very gentlemanly sort of way. You can tell that he takes his business very seriously.  The interior is small but classy; quiet, but in a calming way. All surfaces are consistently pristine and dirty dishes are removed from your area almost as quickly as you can create them.  The sushi chefs are consistently cheerful and talkative, humorous and professional as well. Tonight I saw my favorite, Zach, as usual (I think he might live there), but also had the good fortune of meeting and being served by Josh, a four-day-young addition to the chef team.  As always, the food was superb. Josh was fun to talk to, very funny, and a very capable sushi chef as well. I'm sure he'll be around for a long time. Zach came over to make conversation occasionally, too. Point being: Shimogamo feels like home.  If there is one place that I am consistently EXCITED to tell people about and introduce friends to, it's Shimogamo. I honestly can't believe I haven't reviewed it sooner!  The food is somewhat pricey, but I have never been happier to fork over some $$$ for anything. Besides, they have a great Happy Hour menu for not-rich people like myself!  ;)  If you haven't been to Shimogamo, you need to check it out for yourself. If you HAVE been, I don't know why you've read this far, because you already know all this first-hand!  Well done, Shimogamo (Zach, Josh, and the rest of you)! Thank you for always being SO well worth the drive, the time, and the cost. Keep it up! And I'll keep sending new customers your way."}
{"text":"Its my go to Japanese Restaurant in Arizona. Name is originated in Kyoto, Japan, where the owner is from. So You can expect real Japanese food here.   The got some American sushi rolls here, so all the roll lovers can enjoy the sushi also.  Although I haven't tried their sushi's I expect it to be pretty fresh and good.  Can be pricey, but that is what you expect when eating at good Japanese restaurant. I only saw one other customer when I was there, hope people in AZ are more into experiencing Japanese foods."}
{"text":"A true Chandler gem, must try.  Everything is fresh and delicious. Personal favorites are the beef tongue, yakisoba noodles, and teriyaki chicken. They have many off-menu items that vary and you should give the fish head/cheeks a go they're spectacular. Best way to order is as a combo you really get a lot for the money considering the atmosphere and quality of ingredients.  Best to reserve in advance as the space is small. The best place to sit is in the back room. Another potential downside is that they do run out of menu items from time to time."}
{"text":"Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with my girl based on some of the reviews I read on Yelp.  Very helpful!  I totally loved it.  It is a small restaurant.  We sat at the Sushi bar and our Chef (Al) answered all our silly question with a smile.  Yep, we are pretty silly.  Anyways, we pretty much plundered the awesome Happy Hour menu with my addition token Yellowtail Nigiri.    We ordered: Fried Chicken (amazing) Unagi Sake (Salmon) Yellowtail Shimogamo Roll Panko Roll  1 Sake Bomber 2 small sakes  The Nigiri was super fresh and far outweighed the rice it sat on.  The roll were prepped with super care and they looked fab!  My personal Fave was the Panko Roll.  It was the very subtle in its flavor.  The sauce around the side of the plate was perfect and the one dot of Sriracha put it over the top.  We walked out with all that food for under $50.  It was perfecto, thanks and I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best sushi in East Valley. Service was excellent. Family-owned business and able to answer all questions. Atmosphere and decor were high-end but comfortable, music couldn't have been better. Happy Hour menu could use some more items, however that's not why we choose to eat there. Love, love, loved Chirashi Sushi bowl. Special strawberry custard crepe dessert was amazing! Definitely adding to my favorite sushi restaurants, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the B E S T sushi I've EVER had in my life! The place is small and cozy and the owner was really sweet and kinda reminded me of the old man in Tokyo Ghoul which was pretty awesome. THIS IS LEGIT JAPANESE OWNED YALLS. So you already know it's gonna be bomb!   The food is definitely a 10/10. Their Las Vegas roll was so good and packed with amazing flavors on its own. I really appreciated how the roll had a crunch to it on every bite which is a big plus for me. And their Nigiri (omg) It was so buttery and creamy and just straight up delicious. You can really taste the freshness and tell how well they handle the fish with such care. Their Eel (omfg) made me want to dance it was so good! Literally right when it touches your mouth, it MELTS! All the goodness that makes it like an orgy in your mouth. Yum. To top everything off, and this was my favorite, THE MISO SOUP! I'm a big fan of soups so this was definitely a home run. The first sip of the soup that I had felt like it cleansed my soul. The genuine authenticity that you taste from the richness of the broth, the softness of the tofu and the saltiness from the sea weed just warms your whole body and heart together in perfect harmony.   Thank you SO much Shimogamo for such an amazing experience with your delicious food. Will most definitely be coming back VERY soon and very often!"}
{"text":"Certainly one of the top sushi restaurants in the valley and getting better every day.  I've been to them all and Shimogamo, Yasu's, and Toyama are high above the rest of them.  Warm and inviting, this place is a classy well decorated and lit restaurant tucked into a strip mall.  Head sushi chef Zach has an appetite for bringing in interesting fish and items and is never allowing his customers to get board.  His efforts to bring in new and fresh fish are a reward for those of us who have eaten sushi all of our lives.  It is also a great place to go to early and get some great prices on beer and food.  $4 large Sapporo when many places try and get $8-$10.    A few things are a must if you come here.  The salmon skin rolls here is done 10X better than any place I have ever eaten at.  They make sure the skin is warm and crispy and loaded up.  The sweet shrimp are also a winner.  I spent most of my life not liking raw shrimp but Shimogamo has changed my mind.  I also love all of the crispy parts of the body that are cooked.  Oysters are always wonderful here as are the fresh scallops when they have them.  An absolute must is the Escolar with the Jalapeno.   I never ate Escolar prior and I would normally think that a Jalapeno would overpower such a mild fish but just GET IT.  They torch the fish to draw out some fats and the Jalapeno has wicked smoky flavor.  If you don't like it I can truly say you are strange!  :)  The toro the last few times is better than anything I have tasted in a decade.    The king salmon, fresh mackerel, and Uni are always fresh and perfect.     Everything we have had from the \"cooked\" kitchen is also very good so even if your friends do not eat sushi I would not hesitate to bring them along.    Be careful for lunch because they are only open on Friday I believe.  Reservations are a good idea unless you are there very early or late.  Music is always right on with nice ambient grooves from Thievery Corp and similar bands.    Lastly if you have a large private party for a special occasion they have a back room that can feel very private and classy.  We had a B-day there for 12 and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I'm quite picky when it comes to Japanese food and Shimogamo has never disappointed. We've been going here for over 8 years and it's our go to for Japanese food. The sushi is always fresh and the cooked items are very good. They have the best shrimp tempura I have had in Arizona.  Yoshi, the owner, is at the restaurant every night and is very personable. The service is very good. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good Japanese food."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely surprised to see some bad reviews on Yelp! My boyfriend and I have been there a few times and we absolutely love how intimate and friendly the atmosphere is. We are always greeted by the owner with a friendly smile. We've sat at the tables a couple of times and sushi bar once and have always received excellent service by our server and others who come by to pre-bust our tables. Al, the sushi cheft is just absolutely wonderful! Very passionate about the art of every plate that comes out... Literally a piece of art!   Although it is a small restaurant, my dine-in experience has alway been pleasant. Very pleased with the service given. Most of all, the atmosphere is very intimate and that's what I most love about this place. Oh... And happy hour is everyday from 5-7 can I say AMAZING?! Hallelujah! Finally... A restaurant that has happy hour everyday!   The quality of the food is worth every dollar spent! I rather give my money to an authentic-good quality-freaking awesome-small business than a massive chain with no quality and intimacy. If you have gone here and did not have a great experience, then I would just say, it is worth another try and I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.  Shimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here; bring a friend that you really like and have some great conversation while you enjoy the easy going but very pleasant service.  You won't taste ice on your fish here and it's one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sushi in the desert."}
{"text":"My 82 year old mother-in-law from Kyoto, Japan says, \"I really like it.\" (Imagine the accent) I too think this is a really good place to go, but I will not speak to the authenticity. I will say that we were seated immediately, while there was a full dinning hall. The service was exceptional. My pork cutlet was wonderfully crispy. The mashed potatoes were new to me, but very good. The gyozo my 8 year old ordered was delicious and filling. The menu is unapologetically Japanese, and I mean that in a good way. The decoration is that modern, with just the right amount of lighting for intimacy. Highly recommended by friends and delivered for me."}
{"text":"What a find in the back corner of a strip mall! This sushi place had great, fresh fish, some stellar tempura, and the overall ambiance is completely perfect for a date night. It's a cozy, dark nook next to a diverse array of other businesses. Service was super attentive and helpful. We got a chef's selection of nigiri, one of the specialty rolls, and mixed tempura plus sake and some Japanese beer. The nigiri was super tasty, my favorites the somewhat fatty yellowtail selection and the butter fish. Meanwhile, the specialty roll was also delicious and very well balanced. Now, I love tempura with a passion. This tempura was crispy, perfectly cooked, and not too heavy with a nice light dipping sauce. The only reason for four out of five stars overall is that we felt the price point was just a smidge high (for Chandler standards yet downright reasonable compared to Scottsdale prices) and the sushi rice needs just a bit more finesse to be truly outstanding. Overall, we had a great time here, the fish was great, and we'll be back for many a date night. Plus, can't wait to try to Wagyu beef options for the weekend specials!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in AZ. Authentic. Creative. Delicious. Always coming back for more. Their sushi's definitely have a kick to them. Agedashi tofu is great. The grilled black Snapper's dill sauce is delicious. Rib eye steak is also a must."}
{"text":"Good is good and prices are decent. However, service can be improved. I walked in to place a to-go order and stood around for a few minutes. Then, a man walked in after me, looking to be seated, and the restaurant host/owner ignored me and helped the other guy instead."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was average.   Do not try the pork spare ribs, way too fatty and salty.  Overall, too much money for what we ate."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona! Chef's are wonderful. Fish are fresh and prepared perfectly. Worth a drive from Tucson just for this !"}
{"text":"Shimogamo is always a treat. It's tucked away in an unassuming plaza at Dobson and Warner next to C-Fu Gourmet. The intersection has a high concentration of Asian businesses, so you know this is the real deal. It's a small-ish restaurant, and I am pretty sure they do have teppan tables, but I think everyone basically comes here for the sushi.  This is this east valley place for true sushi and nigiri. It is fresh. And high quality.   I suppose I could go on about all the different rolls and beautiful recipes and combos, but those all fall in line when the fish is fresh. So there you go.  Here's a tip though-this place has restaurant hours-you can't just drive here at 3pm thinking it's open. Make sure it it. And it's worth it."}
{"text":"Miss this place a lot. Went here all the time when I was on my business trip. Fish was very fresh and the chiefs knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"So me my wife and my 3 year old daughter walk in to try this place out since we are new to the area, an old man is there to greet us as we walk in. First thing he does is stare at my daughter like it's taboo to bring a child to his establishment so I get this funny feeling things aren't going to go too smooth. He asks us if we have a reservation I say no do we need one? He replies no you don't, then why ask? He says well there is nothing available at the moment to which I say is fine how long will the wait be? He looks at his watch and says I don't know it depends on the customer. Now I have been to many many restaurants in my lifetime and everytime there is a wait the place usually knows around how long the wait will be. I told me wife that I feel we're not wanted here and she had the same feeling and we decided to just leave. Naturally we tried to figure out why the old man would treat us this way and couldn't figure it out, my only conclusion was that he didn't want my daughter in there because maybe he thought she would have been noisy and could've disturbed his other customers. Granted she would have been the only child in there but she's a really good girl and has been out with us many times. Really disappointed in the way he made us feel and was hoping to find our favorite Sushi place but we will never return here as they don't seem to family friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls for the connoisseur (if there is such a thing).  Shimogamo's home in an Asian focused strip mall is a good indication that this place is the real deal.  Another indication is the need for a reservation, its a good idea to call ahead.  The only thing that did not feel authentic was the service with a smile, the service was impeccable.   The food: - The pan fried dumplings are obviously made in-house to order.  The flour dough wrapping had crispy edges and tasty filling.  Yum!   - The Big N' Spicy Roll was delicious and the spiciest roll I have ever had.  I am pretty hardcore when it comes to heat and I would call this medium.     - The Salmon Skin Roll is a little off the beaten path, again these were the best I have had anywhere bar none (e.i. Japan/Hawaii/CA/FL...).  I don't know if they shaved the skin, but it was crispy and oily (omega-3) almost like bacon (not-omega-3).  The table also shared a Roasted Roll, California Roll and a Futomaki Roll.  All of which were well made with fresh ingredients.   If you are going to try sushi once, try it here.  Just call ahead!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for her first trip to a sushi bar, and we were not disappointed.  Everyone there was very friendly and talkative, and Alan even helped us pick a roll based on our personal tastes.  The atmosphere was inviting and intimate, unlike many of the sushi bars I've been to in the valley.  The Crazy roll and Big and Spicy roll were very delicious and we plan on going back very soon!"}
{"text":"i loved it here! walking in it was really nice to see that almost every table was filled and that everyone looked pretty happy. we decided to sit at the sushi bar where we were greeted by the nicest sushi chefs ever! they were super friendly, talkative, and created some really delicious tasty goodness. it instantly felt like i was in someones living room having some really good food.   shimagamo also has what looks to be an outstanding happy hour. i havent tried it yet but i plan on being a regular so i'll let you know how that goes :).  definitely the best sushi experience i've had since moving to Phoenix. love it!"}
{"text":"Freshest most amazing sushi. My hubs and I are over the over sauced rolls and back to the traditional sashimi when it comes to sushi. No one has better sashimi than here!  I also love their happy hour tempura shrimp. The place is very small but I find that it's better that way!  If you plan to go on the weekend, make reservations!  Also, always try their specials as they usually have toro and it's hard to find. Finally I'd like to say that as someone who grew up on an island and constantly vacations in tropical places famous for great sushi, I dream about Shimogamo."}
{"text":"Reservations for the sushi bar? Never heard of such a thing. Food ok (good for the area) Service ok. Attitude/energy and ambiance sub par. Had much much better in LA, of course though right? ;)....still looking for a traditional top notch sushi bar in the area."}
{"text":"Great food - quiet enough during the week, and Mike is awesome to chat with while he makes sushi at the bar."}
{"text":"We ended up at Shimogamo trying to quench a sushi craving. We picked Shimogamo because of the Yelp reviews and it's proximity to us. I was not impressed at all...  We started off with the fried calamari. It looked great but tasted awful. It was sooo overcooked that I could barely bite in to some of the pieces and it also consisted of mostly tentacles. We ended up arriving at the end of happy hour so we ordered a few items off of the special happy hour list and some from the regular dinner menu. I appreciate that sushi rolls can take time to craft but it took an exorbitantly long amount of time to get from our appetizer to our rolls. And the restaurant was not overly packed.   After the rolls finally arrived they were average, very bland, and some of the rolls flavors seemed off. There was nothing about them that made me want to eat the next piece. As a result, we put our utensils down and requested the check.   Unfortunately Shimogamo left a bad taste in my mouth. This is the fourth sushi place I've been to since moving to Phoenix two months ago and it won't be on my go to list. There are much better establishments in the area - Roku in Scottsdale is amazing.  I would even rate How We Roll in Phoenix better than this place.   I was surprised on the way out of the restaurant when I realized there were two American guys rolling the sushi.   On another note ...   The atmosphere was nice. There are tables in the back that are more intimate and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Chandler... Hands down. Top 2 or three in the state. Depends on what you like. The \"old man\" is a great representative for a lost tradition. Respect is treated with respect. Nothing flashy, nothing trendy ... Just good sushi. Make a reservation, show up with some class and you will be blown away by the quality. Family owned so don't get crazy if things aren't up to the corporate standards of \"why is this taking so long\" or \"how come the restroom is next door\". Just the way it is. Sit, relax and take an hour To enjoy your company."}
{"text":"Great taste. Small rolls. High end of the price spectrum. Not going to be my go to place but it was booked up and we got lucky to get in."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 48th B-Day @ Shimogamo's and they never disappoint.  It seems as with each passing year, their food creations get better and better.  Che Zach's Talents' gets better and better each year.  Whether it's the new creations and complimentary flavors to his sourcing of the fish, Chef Zach's has refined and matured like a fine wine."}
{"text":"Chandler residents, try this place if you like Sushi.  If you live around Chandler/Mesa area, you know how hard it is to find a descent sushi place unlike areas around north Scottsdale.    We ordered few appetizers, multiple sushi and few rolls.  The appetizers and the sushi were pretty good for the most part.  But I do have to mention that the rice for one of the sushi was horrifying.  I've never had rice fall apart on me when I tried to pick it up.  It was soggy and all I could taste was sugar.  Honestly, I'm amazed that the rice kept its nigiri shape on the plate.  I don't know what happened on that particular sushi but yeah, that was unappetizing.  The rolls were ok but nothing special at all.  The portions were tiny and the flavor was barely there.    So, from our point of view, this restaurant is pretty much on the same level as Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA with an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant feel b/c of the presence of Japanese staff and the decor.  That being said, it was really interesting to us because usually, a non-authentic sushi restaurants try to cover their lack of skill by serving pretty good rolls (which is basically an Americanized sushi.)  But this place served better sushi than rolls.  So kudos to them.  Hence, it affected my rating along with the location to 4 stars.        *Location = thank goodness that there is at least one pretty good sushi place around Chandler area *Food = pretty good *Service = very good *Atmosphere = nice and hip *Price = expected for AZ sushi place = over $100/a couple"}
{"text":"We were excited to visit this sushi restaurant. Unfortunately our stomachs were turned as we witnessed the sushi chef bare hand slap the small cockroach that had begun crawling across the glass case in front of us at the sushi bar. Nothing was said, no apologizes were made as we ask for our check, paid for what we hadn't even touch and left."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy spot! Great roll options, so yummy! Only open for lunch on Fridays and we just happened to make it in without even knowing. They said if you come for dinner definitely make reservations. Love the spicy everything!!! You can taste the fish and it's not drowned in mayo like some places. Check out happy hour from 5pm-7pm all 7 days a week! I'll be coming back more often for sure!"}
{"text":"Shimogamo has some of the best sushi I have ever eaten. My parents took me here for dinner and it was love at first bite. The prices are great and their happy hour prices are event better! The owners and staff are friendly and very accommodating. This is a great place to enjoy a nice relaxing night or to have a celebration. I give this place 5 Sushi out of 5!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of sushi places and even though I have dined here once, it was very, very good! Next time I go, I will update this accordingly, but so far I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a zero star I would. The worst service ever in my entire dining experience. We showed up Friday night and they are semi busy. We were immediately seated. However, it took an unreasonably long time before a wait staff came by to get our drink order and it ended up being the \"host\". Then it took a while before the waitress came by and took our order. We were told that they are out of salmon. Ok no problem. We ordered some sushi. After quite a wait, we received 2 of our 4 items. It was ok, nothing exceptional. Then came the long wait. Finally the \"host\" came by and tells us that they are out of eel. Uh....shouldn't they know before we put in the order? However, he had no clue we had another order as well. We asked what about our other sushi order. He went checked, came back and told us they are out of snow crab also. So we said, ok then can we please have our check please since they have nothing to eat. The guy just disappeared and no where to be found. At the same time we never see our waitress again that night. After we waited, and waited, and waited, we finally saw him reemerge from the back. The entire time we didn't see any other wait staff in the front part of the restaurant. He's still completely oblivious. We had to waive him down and gave him the evil eye. He didn't even acknowledge us. And finally after he ducks in the back again he came back with the check. What a nightmare experience. Plus, we don't even really know how they foods are since they have absolutely nothing.... Will never ever go back again. Never had service this awful!"}
{"text":"This is a late post, but here I am!  I went here for the first time on my birthday and it was AMAZING. Hands down the best sushi I have had in a land locked state! It was a little hard to find because it is tucked away in an assuming plaza, but hey, if this creates less foot traffic then I am happy!"}
{"text":"Wow real Japanese food in Phoenix. Cute place with good food, appropriate music and good service. They use Open table so stop the whining about reservations. Don't worry, if you want to drink your sake hot and put cream cheese on your sushi they got that too."}
{"text":"Saw the good review and went there stood at the register for 3 mins before someone noticed me.  Sat at the bar and the chef just kept on talking over your raw food. Some people like it. For a Japanese sushi chef, that's a big Nono.  Salmon tasted very average. Seaweed on the crab roll was soft... meaning it's either not fresh or has been sitting for awhile.  All in all, extremely average and rather poor service.  Again, some people might like the chatty chefs but I like how Japanese chefs never talk at the sushi bar for hygienic reason."}
{"text":"We ate hear last night after a friend recommended them. It was awesome food and service! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My party was lucky enough to walk in and be sat at a table with a party of 3 without a reservation. I guess we walked in just in time. Though I do recommend to get a reservation to dine at this restaurant. It's a small and cozy place but also modern inside and very chill. We ordered some salmon and tuna. I got the curry cause I was craving. We then ordered the waygu beef which was $10 per ounce. They were served on skewers along with a green onion and it was probably one of the best things I've ate. Super tender and juicy. Definitely going to come back, with deep pockets of course"}
{"text":"We mostly ordered off of the happy hour menu, the food was delicious! Even my picky 7 year old enjoyed the food. We drove a little ways to try this place and it was well worth the drive, we will definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"Wow!! Still my favorite spot for sushi in AZ. Al the sushi chef was absolutely amazing! Everything from start to finish was outstanding! High quality and great service. I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar and hanging with Al and Mike. Truly a great time and you never feel rushed. If you're looking for a great experience and not just a quick dinner, I highly recommend Shimogamo!"}
{"text":"My husband called shimogamo to order a take out order (4 rolls to be exact) on a typical Thursday evening around 6. The person he spoke to told him that they were \"too busy\" to do take out orders. He proceeded to tell them that it was his wife's birthday and she really wanted sushi from shimogamo (which was true). They shot him down and no they are \"too busy\" I have NEVER experienced a restaurant denying a customer. Especially one that will not come into the restaurant and take up a table and their wait staffs time. I'm so perplexed and bothered by this situation. They have definatly lost a sushi obsessed customer. Plain and simple shimogamo needs new management so they are not \"too busy\" to take take out order."}
{"text":"Don't be scared away from the location. I've only been here at night, but the area looks deserted.   The sushi here is so fresh and good. I completely agree with another poster who said it just melts in your mouth. And let the chef be creative and make something off the menu for you. You can't go wrong. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. I also think it's a bit pricey, but worth it if you're looking to splurge on the good stuff. I love funky/industrial design of the curtains in the backroom.   I must add that I've been lucky enough to never have had to pay for a meal here.  :)"}
{"text":"Shimogomo is our new sushi place.  Best in the east valley by far.  Enjoyed a great happy hour menu.  Every roll we ordered was fresh and tasted excellent.  We will be back here every pay day now."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! By far the best sushi I ever tasted.  I have recommended this place to a few of my friends and they loved it as well. The staff is amazing and supper friendly.  I love that I can just make a reservation and never have to wait when I get there.  This place is small but comfortable  and never overcrowded which is why the experience is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always top quality whether if it's sushi or cooked foods. Service always great! This is our favorite and go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been searching for a real authentic Japanese restaurant in Arizona for long and got disappointed by so many that were rated 4 to 5 stars on Yelp.   The other day, I found Shimogamo from a Japanese community website in Arizona (www.japanese-in-arizona.com), and I thought it should be authentic and good enough to be posted on that website, so we went there for my birthday to give it a try!  AND FINALLY!!!!! A real authentic Japanese restaurant TwT!!! It's a rather small and unnoticeable restaurant sitting beside C-Fu, but the moment we got closer to the restaurant, we were already amazed by the beautiful interior of the restaurant! The owner (I guess) came to welcome us as we entered, and seated us at the sushi bar. The whole atmosphere was great, with the jazz and/or bossa nova music in the background, every staff smiling, I felt like going back to Japan again (we were surrounded by lots of Japanese diners in the restaurant too)!!  I ordered sushi pieces and my hubby ordered a grilled beef with herb sauce entree. From our experience that we had from other Japanese restaurants in the valley, entrees like grilled beef are usually very teriyaki like, the way I guess many non-asians are used to and prefer, but we were actually amazed and impressed by the beautiful and delicious grilled beef Shimogamo served!! The arrangement of the plate was a surprise:  some carefully sliced mushrooms put underneath, with grilled beef and some veggies on the top, served on a beautiful modern plate (see picture). It just looked so nice! And we were amazed again when we tasted it; the beef was so tender and the aroma of the herb sauce lingered around your mouth...*w*  The sushi I ordered were fresh and tender; the fish would just melt in your mouth (including uni and toro)!! I miss this feeling so much since I moved to Arizona last year and haven't been touched by eating any other Japanese food here. I also ordered a plum wine where its sweetness and light, lovely aroma made me feel soooo relaxed and happy *w*....  Definitely should go for a visit if you're a very picky diner and searching for authentic Japanese food like me! :D"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of sushi places in the west and east side valley and this is by far the best. They serve the sushi cold you know the way its supposed to be... Bottom line it is delicious."}
{"text":"We went to Shimogamo several years ago. It was really good food so decided to go back for our anniversary this year. When we walked into the restaurant it seemed a little busy not too crowded. We were willing to wait to be seated. However, an older man who might have been the owner walks over to us saying there is no table for us. We just stood there thinking we will wait. He just kept repeating no table as if our business was not welcome. I was very offended and walked out. It almost ruined our anniversary dinner. This has never happened to me before and we will never go back to this restaurant. They only seem to be welcoming customers who are worthy in which we were clearly not."}
{"text":"The sushi quest continues.  And we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the East Valley.  So we rolled into Shimogamo, a small place next to C-Fu Gourmet and across the street from Lee Lee Market.  With neighbors this Asian, they have to be legit, right?  The first thing I noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options, but a limited set of specials.  That's fine, maybe we can see if there's anything they're not telling us about... Or ask the chef to make us something interesting.  We started with the beef carpaccio.  Carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat, served raw with some marinade, scallions, and other garnishes.  This one was supposed to be seared, but it came out medium.  It was pretty good, but could have been much better if it were actually served rare.  Next, we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with.  Disappointingly, the chef didn't come over and tell us what he made, and the waitress didn't seem to know.  But it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of Japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko.  It was good, but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting.  Probably the least memorable surprise we've had from a sushi chef yet.  Next, we had albacore and escolar sushi.  They were both good, and came garnished, so I didn't add any soy sauce to those... And they were conveniently on the happy hour menu.  Bonus!  We had a spider roll afterwards, and while I'm not usually a fan of rolls, I always like a good soft-shelled crab.  This one was better than some of the others I've had, on account of the fact that it also had avocado.   The waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi (with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp!).  These shrimp were huge, and fresh.  Plus, as an added bonus, the heads came stuffed to the brim with \"goodies.\"  I'm not exactly sure what the goodies are, but they have a distinct flavor, and I suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with.  We had the tuna poke, which seems to be Shimogamo's signature dish.  It tastes great, but it is quite basic.  Basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg.  This is one of those times when \"less is more\" is true.  After this, we had another item on the specials board, the orange yellowtail.  This is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor, served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha.  This was actually pretty delicious.  Finally, we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri, and quail eggs.  The salmon roe was some of the best I've had in awhile (they didn't have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control).  Unfortunately, a few of the things we wanted to order were not available.  They didn't have any uni, baby yellowtail, or toro, which was really quite a bummer.  The owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out, so I appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh.  Some of this is the fault of their clientele, who from what I could tell, is very caucasian, and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish.    My final verdict on Shimogamo is that it's good, but a clear step below the best sushi places I've been to.  Everything was fresh, and the dishes were well-executed.  Furthermore, the prices were reasonable.  All of these make it a very respectable location, and potentially the best in the East Valley (we'll have to try the competition, of course).    Where they fall short is in two areas: first, the menu (and it seems the chefs) lack creativity.  They do a limited set of dishes well, but they don't seem to be food artists.  It's a little too generic.  Second, the waitress didn't seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items, and had to ask the chef about a few things.  If she is relatively new, I could give her a pass.  Shimogamo may compete for the \"best in East Valley\" subcategory, but it can't quite hang in the top tier."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place for so long, but what a disappointment it turned out to be! Maybe Monday evening is not the best time to get fresh ingredients from this place. Maybe it was not the right chef there at the moment. Maybe you get mediocre food when you \"take it out\". I have no idea what went wrong, but if the place is consistently good, these factors should not matter, especially when your bill is $88 for 2 (food only).  Where do we begin? The presentation. I will give them that, almost everything looked neat and appetizing. I know size of sushi maybe a problem for some people, but not for us. We like small pieces with thinly sliced fish. In our mind that is how sushi are supposed to be, not gigantic pieces of thick fish for the added value. There are 2 potential problems here and we had both: freshness of fish and the way their rice is prepared. It was too sticky, too mushy and seemed to be too salty. At least it was not pressed as they usually do at stores (and unfortunately at some restaurants, yuck!) Same applies to the rolls we ordered (btw when a customer insists on no cucumber for both rolls, you repeat it while talking an order, it is a huge disappointment to find cucumber in both rolls!). Real crab sushi was too salty for me, ok for my husband. He said Eel sushi was good.  Albacore Tuna Tataki salad - very fresh greens, nice sauce on a side, thank you for that, but not so fresh tasting albacore tuna! Could not finish it, put it aside after trying one piece. Same thing was with albacore tuna sushi. Lobster dynamite - a mess of a baked mayo with langostino tails on the bottom (Costco?). If we ignore a huge amount of baked mayo for a second, I  don't understand how you can replace a lobster with langostino tails without letting your customers know. There is a difference, it is not the same, and do not try to convince me otherwise! It is not ethical to call langostino a lobster, and it is not ethical to substitute one with another without letting your customers know (have no idea what was the case, but I suspect the first scenario) Also, please do not put slices of overripen avocado with tiny brown spots on a side - just skip it if you don't have a fresh one.  I do not get all these 5 star yelp reviews for this place. Besides, they do not even have half of the items pictured here from 2013. It is possible that the owner or chefs changed from those glorious times, but I am just speculating at this point. One positive thing Pan Fried Gyoza and Yakisoba were quite tasty, but these dishes are not the main reason I go to a sushi restaurant, fresh fish and properly cooked rice are.  My husband and I got severe stomach ache the night after eating this dinner. I usually can eat nails and while people around me feel as if they were poisoned, I either feel nothing or very little. This is the first time in a few years I got poisoned. Without this last fact or if we had eaten or drank something else besides this dinner, it would have been 2 stars. Since I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache, it is just 1 star, sorry. In the evening I was willing to give them a second chance, but in the morning I do not feel so generous at all! Waste of our time, energy and money."}
{"text":"Great sushi and a wonderful ambiance. The service is excellent; my non-sushi eating mother interrogated our waiter on nearly all of the menu options, and the waiter politely responded to all of our inquiries, later explaining that all of the items were explained on the regular menu.  We were there for happy hour and were able to order several rolls for an amazing price, especially given the high quality. I am already craving Shimogamo and will return later this weekend! FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and speedy. As soon as I finished a dish, another one immediately on its way to my table. The sushi (spicy tuna, salmon, crazy roll) was excellent, and I noted how the rice was shorter and plumper than normal. Delicious.  The tofu dish we received was also excellent. A good balance of sweet and salty, with a nice soft center.  Interiors are nice, dim ambient lighting. The place is intimate with not many tables and seats.  I would definitely come back for my second meal."}
{"text":"The sushi was great (one of the better sushi restaurants in Chandler), but the service was SLOW and the servers were RUDE.   My friend and I placed our order and after about 45 minutes, it arrived. The portions were small, we decided we would order another couple items. We tried for 30 minutes to get the attention of the waitstaff (and considering this place seats maybe 30-40, it shouldn't have been hard...), but they blatantly ignored us and walked by our table at least 4 times, avoiding eye contact and seemingly deaf.   This would have easily rated 5 stars, but the service made the experience almost painful...Will never return."}
{"text":"Most delicious shashimi I've ever tasted. Grilled shishito peppers, beef carpaccio, and panko roll are must haves!!"}
{"text":"Great service and wonderfully tasty food!   Please try:  the citrus and zen rolls, spicy yellowtail, pan fried gyoza dumplings and black cod.  Our favorite, however, was the bbq beef tongue (recommendation of our gracious waiter).  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love sushi. And not that trendy americanized sushi that seems so popular these days. I like fresh fish that's not drowning in sauce, which hides its flavor, that is true to Japanese style sushi. The vast majority of sushi places I have tried are americanized.   Not this place. I am so glad I read thru the reviews of this place and that it's only a few miles away from me now.  Tucked into the corner of a strip mall, sharing a bathroom with the C-Fu Gourmet, this place is very unassuming looking and simple. We were surprised to show up at 515pm on a Tuesday (they open at 5) and already most tables were filled.  The decor and ambiance was perfect. Music was a jazzy fusion feel and it was nice and dark colored with light accents.   We sat in the back room, feeling like mobsters doing a business deal. The center of this room has a huge family style table with a classy beaded drape that could be used as separaters.  On the wall was a classy sign showing their specials. When I asked our server about it, she explained, without prompting, which fish was freshest and how a couple specials are cooked. Just with that, this place got 5 stars from me and I hadn't even tried their food yet.  Side note for people with dietary restrictions: I have Celiac Disease and I am 100% gluten free so everything I ate or drank is gluten free. See the end of the review for my glowing gluten free/cross contamination review.  I ordered a plum wine that came in a beautiful little glass that forces you to enjoy the wine, not suck it down. In other words, you refill this tiny thing from a carafe that holds the full glass.   I also tried some of my husbands house sake he got with the expectation that it would be the normal bitter taste, like usual, and no. It wasn't bitter at all! It actually had a sweet ending! I was blown away.  We started with a nice fresh seaweed salad.  We ordered what was inherently gluten free, staying away from any imitation krab or breaded/fried items.  We ordered:   Alaska roll - snow crab was used and copper river salmon - smoky, awesome crab with a slightly citrus taste. Not jam packed with a ton of ingredients or sauce. SO AMAZING. Expensive but damn worth it.  Spicy salmon - smoky and spicy  Philly roll - strong cream cheese but good like that  Citrus roll - very good balance of acidity and spice with a fresh ending  Uni was super fresh and creamy. Uni is normally creamy, but this was the ULTIMATE creamy. I don't think I've ever had such fresh uni.  We ended the evening with green tea ice cream for myself and red bean for the hubs. Excellent as usual.  I have held off on writing this a couple days... I typically go to sushi with the expectation that I likely will get some sort of glutening due to how many places that use non-gluten free soy sauce in their sauce mixes.   I was never glutened at all. No reaction. This could mean 2 things: 1) they use gluten free soy in their mixes or 2) they don't use soy sauce at all in their sauce mixes. I'm betting on that they don't use soy sauce at all and leave it to you to add it when eating if you wish.   Add all that together... amazing food, amazing ambiance, not getting glutened... I would give this place 10 stars if I could.   Totally worth the cost. Go here if you love sushi."}
{"text":"5 stars only because I can't give MORE!!  Never a disappointment in the quality and service. Been dining here for years and always recommend it to friends looking for legit high grade sushi in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Shimogamo is by far the best sushi restaurant in the Phoenix valley. Authentic, quality food & great service. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Nestled right next door to C-Fu Gourmet, it would be easy to miss this little gem but you really have to make an effort to try this place out if you enjoy sushi. The service was excellent and the menu was pretty expansive for such a small place.   Because I'm pregnant, I'm trying to limit my exposure to raw fish so I ordered the chicken teriyaki platter. It came with rice, soup, salad, and a full breast of teriyaki chicken. Unfortunately, my food arrived cold. I was disappointed but sucked it up so as not to embarrass our hosts. For this, I lowered my rating one star. Cold food is a pet peeve of mine.    My son and our hosts enjoyed the sushi and kept noting its freshness and great flavor. Hubby enjoyed the teriyaki ribs and his meal was served hot hot hot. Not sure what happened with mine, but oh well.   I'm looking forward to going back after my pregnancy so I can try out the sushi and hopefully the hot food will be hot."}
{"text":"The sushi chef Aaron made my trip here one of my fondest sushi experiences.  He created 2 masterpieces that I won't forget - seared tuna with butter garlic sauce.  And. Yellowtail sushi handroll filled with lime juice.  Perfection.  Great little restaurant."}
{"text":"We liked the service.....sushi also fresh....steak cooked right....generally pretty good"}
{"text":"This is literally the best sushi we've ever eaten in Arizona. Don't even bother sitting at a table. Sit at the sushi bar and just let the chefs make something delicious for you. Great experience, great service and a wonderful evening. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is genuinely lacking at this place, but the food is great.  When you order appetizers or happy hour items, don't expect them to come prior to your entree. They will likely come intermittently during, and after (think of your sushi roll as your dessert). I completely forgot about one of the appetizers we had ordered, and by the time it came, our entrees were done. They serve everyone as the entree is ready as well... Not great when there are 4-5 of you and each person is waiting out of courtesy to begin their meal.   There are numerous times where I have been here where they have been out of certain dishes due to issues with the kitchen.   The ambiance is good- small tables, but a nice seating area in the back if you have a large enough group."}
{"text":"First time eating here after reading the reviews of other yelpers. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the dishes that came out to us. They did not disappoint! We ordered the prime rib steak dinner, and some sushi platters. Every bit of taste, and texture was spot on right to the last bite. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating sushi and it was excellent, my son has had sushi many times and he thought this was by far the best he has had. Al took great care of us, he explained everything to us and also kept a nice conversation going. As far as the older gentleman that some people have complained about goes, I had the complete opposite experience... he was very nice and friendly, he shook my hand when I left. I made my reservation on open table and had no problems, I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Always an awesome time. The whole team there is great and the fish is fresh. You're in for a treat, especially if they have baby yellowtail. Try the beef carpaccio...delish. Al is rad."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Authentic sushi and hot dinners.  Wonderful su chefs who know what they are doing.  Make reservations or plan to leave your # and be called when a table (or the bar) opens.  Sit at the sushi bar for an even better experience.  They have different fresh fish delivered on the weekend so there are always off menu specials.  I saw other reviewers say the service was terrible.  I didn't see that at all.  Drinks were refilled before they went empty, plates were taken as soon as we finished.  Maybe they were complaining about the wait time, but it's sushi it takes a while to make (especially when it is a full house.)  Had a wonderful time and will definitely be back soon.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably a total of 20 times now and have sampled pretty much everything on the sushi menu multiple times. I also have been served by just about everyone who works there. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is so nice, the staff is so friendly, and above all the sushi is so tasty. On a super busy night, the wait may be a bit long (happened to me maybe twice), but if you get there before the crowd, you're sure to have a good time.   The name Shimogamo, meaning family, is a very touching and appropriate name. The husband and wife who run this restaurant are the sweetest, most mild mannered Japanese couple and make you feel warmly welcomed to take a casual glimpse into their way of life, culture, and family."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for our Foodie Friday experience and it was just ok. Their sushi rolls are alright. Nothing special about them that wow'd us. I've had better sushi rolls elsewhere. Their small plates and appetizers were good though. I'd return to try different small plates and appetizers. Plus they forgot one of our sushi roll orders that we waited over 10 mins for then when they inquired about it and it wasn't even made or started we just canceled the order. Cute small place though."}
{"text":"Went for my son's 15th birthday to enjoy lunch.  Sushi is his favorite.  This place is small and you have to go into the restaurant next door for the restroom.  The menu is fairly limited and expensive, in my opinion.  The service was average and the food was just okay.  I don't think we would bother to go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Shimogamo for the first time tonight, and we were very impressed by its authenticity (proof: we were the only white people in there). The restaurant has a chic but casual feel, and the entire staff was super friendly from the get-go. The highlight was definitely the sushi. We've been accustomed to the overly fried and overly saucy sushi from over-hyped places like Ra and Sushi 101. The sushi at Shimogamo was made with fresher ingredients and was simply delicious in its own right (e.g. not drenched in sauce to cover just OK sushi). We can't wait to come back for happy hour! AND definitely try the \"Crazy Surprise roll\"...you'll be surprised by how crazy AWESOME it is!"}
{"text":"I have found a sushi place that I adore, and I am semi worried of sharing it with people for fear it will become crazy busy but.... Alas, it's my duty to share delicious things!  I came here last week and sat at the bar and had a nice conversation with Zach and I believe Ben. The owners are super sweet and are fast with waters and checks.   We ordered the citrus, the zen, and the house named roll, allllll were so good. Oh also, we got an order of the eel which was amazing as well.   I like the size of this place, it's pretty intimate and everyone wants you to try new things and flavor combinations. This will be my new go to sushi bar!"}
{"text":"Very fresh delicious sushi!  I love the small, intimate atmosphere so I felt very comfortable sitting at the sushi bar solo.  The only reason they get a 4 is because of the waitress service."}
{"text":"My go-to place for sushi in Phoenix. The Shimogamo, Crazy, and Futomaki rolls are my favorite here. Sushi is really fresh and very authentic. This place definitely deserves every good review it has (meaning it's not one of those over-hyped places where you leave disappointed)!! Service is fast and friendly. It's a small place with cozy decorations, perfect for gatherings!"}
{"text":"Average. Came here with my son and wife. Good service. Prompt seating. Okay prices.   Soups-not hot, just barely warm miso and sobo noodle, which is disappointing as the broth was yummy.   We primarily ordered sushi rolls. Nothing to write home about. It clearly reminded me that Mesa is not near the ocean.   I will probably return to check out the Chinese restaurant next door. Massive setting with Asian stage."}
{"text":"This is the only Japanese restaurant in the entire Phoenix Metro Area that serves authentic Japanese food. I say this as someone who lived in Japan for five years (2004-2009) and just returned from a two week vacation to Japan. Everything on the menu is excellent as we have tried it all over the years. They will make some Japanese dishes that aren't on the menu if they have the items needed on hand (Okonomiyaki, Ramen, Hamachikama, black sesame ice cream, etc...). If you want to experience authentic Japanese food this is it. It is disappointing in a metro area of 4.5 million people there are no other authentic Japanese restaurants but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Shimogamo was excellent!   I've bookmarked this place for a long time now and have finally made RSVP to go.  I was greeted and sat right away.  We made RSVPs because reviews said they get packed and lucky we did because they sure did!    Service was great.   The quality of the fish we had ordered was beyond what we expected!  We had also ordered beef tongue, which was grilled to perfection.   We will def be back again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, clean cut and friendly staff, clean & warm environment..a hidden gem. Perfect for a date.   Prices are on the higher side. Service? Asi asi. Please refill my iced green tea"}
{"text":"Finally...! A place I can be confident to refer friends and family to this place. Fiance and I normally drove to San Diego to get our sushi fix, we're really happy that we discover this place. Mike was the sushi chef, let just say that he knows his fish and proud of what he does and very welcoming. Definite be back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Went on a whim for happy hour. We were shocked we only had to wait about 10 min for a table. The owner is also the host and is always very dry. Lol.. don't let him detour you from getting a seat.  This place is seriously.. seriously.. the best sushi in PHX. Hands down. The intimate feel, the simple menu, THE SUSHI. All of it is amazing. Al was our sushi chef and even though he was busy, he was awesome. He recommended a the beef tongue app and it totally changed my idea of tongue. It was almost like a delicious thin sliced carne asada. Will Order that every time now. The fried gyoza was perfectly crispy and had an sweet savory sauce drizzled. Happy hour has some really great options for this caliber of a place, but do yourself a favor and get a couple options off the normal menu."}
{"text":"What a great place to find in Chandler! It's a tiny little space, but don't let that fool you. The flavors of the food are big! Not only was the food really good, and reasonably priced, but the staff was super friendly. We felt like regulars on our first visit. I will be back for sure! Thanks, Yoshi!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sashimi - we tried the salmon, yellow tail, and tuna belly. All delicious - very fresh and high quality- best I have ever had. I asked the owner and he said that fresh fish is flown in daily. Sushi rolls were excellent also - vegas, spicy salmon, and Cali roll were all fantastic. Nice wine selection that we matched to our meal. The owner was very nice to us and took time to talk and answered some novice questions we had on the cuisine. The waitress was excellent and made our dinner fun and when asked took a nice pic of us to document our excellent dining experience. Shimogamo is the best Japanese restaurant experience that I have had."}
{"text":"I hate to give a shout out to what I wished stayed a best kept secret. The best kept secret is out, the sushi is awesome, the decor is lovely, the owner is present and so kind. There is not one place in Scottsdale or Tempe that come close to the quality of the cuts, delicate.. this is true sushi.  As I said the cat is out of the bag which means that nowadays, you might find a line to be seated and the place is not huge.. you get the idea. But it's so worth it. Love it, it's my second time here.. 2/2 perfect. Thank you."}
{"text":"Small quaint place. Hardly anyone else there. Went for happy hour after reading yelp reviews...and so glad we did. It was great! Decent prices and awesome sushi. Nigiri has pretty big pieces also, eel sauce not overly sweet. Vegas roll best I've had in Phoenix. Salmon melts in your mouth. Miso soup good, beef carpaccio cooked very well and not drenched in sauce. Crazy roll is pretty awesome with right amount of spice. Yum! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Unless you like ama ebi Or uni  Or really any of the \"rarer\" sushis, I wouldn't recommend this place.    Its very good, very fast, very fresh, but also very expensive  Personally I stick with basic nigiris, so this place is just too much for what it is!"}
{"text":"I have a couple of complaints:  1.  They were out of oysters on the day I went, and I really stopped in exclusively to have them. 2.  The prices on the \"Happy Hour\" menu on their website are incorrect.  I paid $6.50 instead of the listed $5.50 for my chicken.  The only item I tried was 4.5-star-worthy, and that was the \"Japanese Fried Chicken.\"  Lightly breaded and yummily juicy white meat. Very tasty.  Small portion for $7.09 though - only about 7 or 8 small bite-sized pieces.  The taste made me wish even more that they had not been out of oysters.  But as others have noted, the \"price to value\" equation here is on the pricey side.  P.S. It has been pointed out to me by a helpful Yelper that oysters are \"not in season\" in August, and that's why they were not serving them.  That's fine, but I would say to a restaurant owner that if you have something on your menu that is available only in certain months, then you should say that on the menu.  *oysters available only in etc etc etc.  That way, people won't drive over there to get something which is out of season."}
{"text":"My mom came to town to help me out with surgery and on her last night we wanted to go out somewhere for a good dinner to celebrate me feeling better. After a bit of thinking i remember this place. We came here durring happy hour which was great as they have some great prices especially for the quality.  The nigiri here is phenomenal we had both Escolar and Albacore both of which were amazing. Surprisingly the escolar was cooked (with hand held torch) but had amazing flavor and great texture (and i am not a big fan of cooked sushi).  We also had the Crazy roll (half off for happy hour), the big and spicy roll (still great), a negi-yellowtail (not chopped up like most places just shashimi cuts with scallion and wrapped), and i had a spicy tuna hand roll. All of it was great and the fish quality top notch.  We also had the house cold sake (too sweet for my taste but not bad).  The only downsides were the miso was again a bit cold (the tofu is not soaked in the the soup but tossed in cold). And also there was an odd smell that i am pretty sure is from the fish joint next door but not from here.  For the 2 of us with the sake it was $50 and worth it all. As for price it is about the same i expect for a dinner from Ra, Kona, Sakana, ect but the quality of fish is so much higher and the taste is way better.  Have to say Shimogamo is rapidly becoming my favorite sushi place in the valley"}
{"text":"Good service. Really great food. Nice atmosphere. A little pricey but  they didn't hassle when we sat at our table talking half an hour after finished eating."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years & I can't believe I've never left a review! This hidden sushi bar is one of the best in town. It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and is almost always packed! The fish is always fresh - SO fresh you can usually find something still alive as their daily special! There's also beef and chicken rice and noodle dishes off the menu for those that may not like sushi. The chefs are super creative, so if you'd like something you don't see on the menu, they can accommodate you."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Japanese and sushi place. I highly suggest making reservations because it is small and it fills up fast. The Korean ribs are fantastic and the flavors really rock. We always get loads of sushi and I order the tempura udon soup which always satisfies. Love it!"}
{"text":"Okay, you ready for this one? My boyfriend...loves sushi! Me...let's just say I've had my issues with experiencing sushi but I wished I liked it because I know it is good for you and it looks amazing. So, of course being adventurous people we decide to branch out and try a new restaurant. When you pull into the parking lot it is tucked away in the corner so make sure you do not miss it. You walk in and you get this great small business feel to it. The best way to describe its ambiance is that it is a cozy, average-lit, clean, modernized sushi hole in the wall! Love it!  We were sat up at the sushi bar which probably holdds around 15-20 people max. (see picture) Along the wall there were around 5 small tables and in the back there is a private 'party' room. (See picture) We were automatically brought water, and served small plates with fresh wasabi and sliced ginger as well as given soy dipping dishes. we decided to order a cold sake and it was recommended by our waiter (good choice).  My boyfriend is the sushi expert and decides to just pick a few random things for us to share. We had the spicy tuna roll (the only one I did not try), the octopus, the eel, the yellowtail, sea urchin, spicy scallop hand roll and escolar. Let me tell you...wow!! The seafood was really very fresh. The escolar was my favorite or as the awesome sushi-ya (Zach) put it baby dolphin! LOL. I told him they should put that up on their specials board. Have it read: fresh flipper rolls! Oh, and by the way, they have live shrimp that you can eat after watching them prepare it to special standards! (see picture)  So, back to the quality of the food. The only comment my boyfriend really had was about their octopus. He was expalining to me the difference between good octopus and bad...it's the texture and firmness of it. The food looked beautiful and tasted very clean and elegant. I most definately seeing us coming back here again. Especially to talk more about baby dolphins being freshly clubbed daily with Zach! :) Thank you for making our evening very fun and very special! I will remember this sushi moment forever!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh salmon...great cuts... I only wish we could've saved Harvey...Ama Ebi ...poor little guy was dying and no one gave him mouth to mouth...he died in my arms...no, mouth LOL tuna sashimi was amazingly fresh"}
{"text":"Really good sushi place but hard to get in without reservations.  A real Sushi and Japanese restaurant, not the ones that only serve rolls."}
{"text":"Spotted them on YELP looking for a sushi place.  Good reviews, so here we are!  First impression...Reggae??  Playing reggae in a Japanese restaurant?  That's odd.  Pretty typical menu for a Japanese restaurant.  I had curry, daughter had sushi.  Both were very good.  A tad pricey, but some of the better Japanese food and sushi I've had in a while.  Service was adequate.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I'd read reviews and was looking forward to trying Shimogamo.  Unfortunately I found it overpriced and average quality.  I sat at the bar and while the service was attentive I got very tired of the sushi chef and my waiter discussing their past and future party plans the whole time."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi around.  They have the freshest fish and high-grade as well.  The Toro melts in your mouth and I recommend as sashimi.  The food is so fresh that one time they had Ama Ebi on special and they billed it as fresh.  I assumed it was flown in fresh.  In actuality is was alive in a tank in the back.  This place is pricey, but well worth it.  They do have some great deals on some items during Happy Hour.  Also, they have some special rolls not on the menu that they will make when it is not too busy...I highly recommend the citrus roll."}
{"text":"Good sushi in the neighborhood. We'll definitely be back! Second time here and it doesn't disappoint. Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We were there for happy hour on a Friday.  We tried the Crazy roll and the Zen roll among others.  The Crazy roll was excellent, and the Zen was not bad.  Overall this is probably the best sushi I've had in the Phoenix area.  The service was very attentive, and the menu variety was very good.  I have no problem recommending this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and nice ambiance. We sat at the bar and were entertained by one of the chefs; although both chefs working at the time seemed friendly and welcoming. The food was amazing! A little pricey compared to other Japanese restaurants that we go to, but that's the price you pay for great food courtesy of Mama San. Would definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places ever. My experience has been California SF and SD fish and some from China (not Japan however). I would eat here for good sushi 10 times out of 10 if in Arizona. They also have great grilled fish, the beef carpaccio was only$10 but super good. Don't forget to order Escolar sushi. Beef rib is good too."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 starts or was \"Best of Phoenix\" for 2016.  The fish was fresh, but our spicy salmon, California roll, and tuna roll all tasted about the same.  The happy hour menu was very limited, and the portions were quite small ($3 for a very small bowl of eda mame - my 7-year-old plowed through 2 bowls on her own).  The best roll was the Citrus Roll, and even that was rather bland.  The service was okay.  The best thing about the place is the decor - very pretty.  There is also sufficient parking.  So, basically, everything about this place is \"just okay.\"  There were 2 adults and a child (who only had miso soup and eda mame), DURING HAPPY HOUR, and our bill was $65."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover, you will love Shimogamo.  We stuck mostly to their happy hour menu and really enjoyed every dish.  The fish tasted very fresh and the employees including our server were all excellent.  I love shrimp anything and their Tempura (5pc) $6 was one of the best I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Toro, toro, toro! Took my son here for his 21st birthday and it was excellent! Sit at the sushi bar the preparation is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant twice just recently and both times it was fantastic! Excellent service and the food was uniquely prepared. The fish was very fresh and flavorful. Even the mackerel was good - not overly fishy at all."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had (I prefer Bei or Akai Hana) but it does the job... And they have some good lunch specials and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Must be a HOT SPOT... I tried calling for take out, serving for a party of 10ppl, but the person who answered said \"sorry, we're so busy, we can not take your order at this time\" KABUKI is our normal GO TO, just found this place was closer to home and would give it a try...  NOT HAPPENING! (Wouldn't even give 1 star, since we didn't get to try)"}
{"text":"Dinner was very good.  Glad we had reservations, its not a big place. I enjoyed the sushi and grilled salmon and would recommend Shimogamo"}
{"text":"My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.     The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.  In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.  The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.  However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.  Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.  It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.  You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi.  The restaurant is very non-descript.  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet."}
{"text":"Best, I mean best, sushi in Chandler.  So fresh.  So flavorful.  No fancy shmancy rolls. Been 20 or so times.  Will keep going."}
{"text":"Shimogamo is easy to miss tucked away in the corner of this strip mall next to C-Fu Gourmet. Make the effort to find it, it's well worth it!  Not a huge raw fish fan, so I always keenly interested in the other stuff a \"sushi\" place serves. This place has a great selection!  From dumplings to tempura to soup. There's plenty deliciousness to find here even if your not in the mood for sushi or sashimi.  However, if you are in the mood for fishy - this place is hard to beat. Great variety, excellent preparation, and wonderful service.    Very intimate and always busy, this is one of those place that you just have to experience for yourself."}
{"text":"I have to say this is my favorite sushi place in the east valley. I like how small the restaurant is and very well maintained. Although the prices are in the higher end, that's okay, it's worth the fresh sushi. I would recommend going here for happy hour. Their service is amazing but I would refrain from doing a dinner for more than 7 people because the same is a bit small."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley, period. Awesome! Good service, classy atmosphere, still casual and laid back. Prices aren't bad, either, and there is a pretty good happy hour!"}
{"text":"Flew from the east coast and had to have some sushi. This little gem in Chandler was cool, friendly and the sushi was first rate. Sushi chefs were very friendly and brought out the young yellow fish and blue fun! If you want sushi, make this a stop. Nice job Guys!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for lunch, having been recommended to the place by a dear friend.   I met my son there for his birthday.   It was recommended that I make reservations, which I did.   They are only open one day of the week for lunch.   It is a nice atmosphere.   It is adjacent to a Chinese restaurant, which I've been to for dim sum.   I am not sure if the two restaurants are owned by the same owners, but the rest rooms are shared.  So that was different. ...  We both had the assorted sushi.   I asked to substitute the rolled tuna for the salmon roe nigiri, which they accommodated.  Thank you!   Of course, if I were to order the rolled tuna versus the salmon roe nigiri, the rolled tuna costs more.  If I remember correctly, the assorted sushi is eight pieces of nigiri.  It makes for a light lunch.   In fact, if I was starving, I would have still been hungry.   One of the fish had a bit of a fishy smell.   You know what that means!   And the salmon roe nigiri had the liquid of the roe on the dish when I lifted it from the serving platter.  GROSS!   I make salmon roe nigiri.   If there is liquid involved, it needs to be drained.    Our server was quite friendly, professional, and accommodating.   Unfortunately, I don't know her name since it is not on the check.  I wasn't in the mood to try any of the teriyaki nor the noodles or rice dishes.   If I was inclined to travel that far for sushi or Japanese food, I might go back.   Since there are good Japanese restaurants closer to me, I think I would be inclined to skip.   I debated whether to give it three or four stars but settled on the four since the atmosphere is good, the service is good, and even though I was disappointed with a couple of the nigiri, the rest of it was good."}
{"text":"Long story short, this is the best sushi place on this side of town.   I have been here probably 20 or so times and felt a review was long overdue. I come here for lunch almost every Friday as that's the only day of the week they do lunch. I have been here for dinner many times as well and it's very good. This review will discuss lunch.  Get here very close to 11:30 if you're coming on Friday for lunch. There are tons of regulars and the sushi bar will be filled in the first few minutes so it's ideal to get here right around 11:30.  When I come for lunch, I get the same thing every time. It's a variation of their sushi special, but instead of a cut roll, I just get some more nigiri. This is without a doubt, the best quality:price ratio in existence when it comes to sushi. 11 pieces of well-crafted, fresh nigiri, with thoughtful and delicious garnishes. I have also been there when the have live shrimp and it's well worth the splurge.   Service is always good. Overall, this is probably my favorite place to go for lunch, even if it's only open on Fridays."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, left sorta unhappy. I LOVE SUSHI/ROLLS. And Ive always looked for amazing Sushi joints. When i looked for a decent sushi place near my house, Shimogamo popped up. I was excited to go since I saw the high praises specially for the happy hour. Anyway overall, it's forgettable. The rolls (salmon or cali) were so tiny that I wouldnt purchase it full price. I didn't know if that's really the portion of it (should be) or they lessened it since it's on happy hour? My most faves: Las vegas roll and salmon skin roll were not what I expected them to be. They were seriously lacking on flavor. Service was so-so. The lady was okay but the guy/greeter was rude. We were just looking at the soy sauce container and he said \"You dont open it\" while getting it from my hands. Geez. Calm yo self. Anyway over all, Id skip this joint. I know places much better and much worth the 62 bucks bill. One star for cleanliness, another for pretty presentation."}
{"text":"This place was a great find!  It reminds me of the little Japanese places that litter LA, and for which I constantly long.  Being our first time at this place, we stuck to the basics and ordered several types of Nigiri and hot sake.  The Nigiri was excellent.  Although we tried some of the more exotic choices, we found that the basic salmon and albacore were our favorites.  Their house hot sake is also not your typical cheap and bitter California-brewed variety you get at most places.  Their's is both sweet and smooth and perfectly drinkable!  I love that they let you pick your own sake glass too.  We will definitely be back to Shimogamo!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check this place out because I've heard such great reviews from everyone I know. So I finally decided to go...   As we walked in I remember saying to myself, man I expected this place to be bigger, but it had a nice cozy feel to it in my opinion and the decor was nice. Never being here before we just kind of stood by the door til someone finally greeted us and took us towards the back, a lonesome 2 top. Lol As much as I can eat I was thinking this table definitely isn't going to be big enough but guess we will see!  I ordered for us, BBQ Beef tongue- pretty delicious for being a tongue off an animal esp with the sea salt and lemon juice they give you. UNI sashimi- super delicious and sweet, melted in my mouth. Big and spicy roll- pretty yum but not my favorite  Baby Lobster and Crab salad- super delicious and pretty decent amount of meat. White Truffle Amberjack- mild flavor, not fishy   And a few other things I can't remember...  Service was nice and friendly, but definitely kind of slow, but I was too busy eating to really notice for the most part."}
{"text":"Excellent device and food! The dessert is amazing also! So leave leave room for it! I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times now and have tried all of their specialty rolls. Everything is delicious. Our favorite is the tsunami roll, which has no rice. Their calamari in the best I have ever had. I never really ordered calamari anywhere else until I had it here. Now my expectations are too high when I order it elsewhere and I am always disappointed. Also, order a side of the soy jalapenos, they are great on top of sushi.   The restaurant is small and very cozy. It is always very clean and the food is very fresh. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place but when we walked in, instead of saying \"I'm sorry we are booked and it will be a 40 minute wait\" but instead just says \"NO were booked\" and made a hand motion to match the no - clearly they don't understand customer service or care whether we would ever come back, which we won't - I don't care how good the food reviews are the customer service was so bad I will be sure to deter others from trying this place."}
{"text":"L.A. quality sushi at Chandler prices! This is a very cozy restaurant with a wonderful happy hour. Best seats in the house are at the sushi bar where you get to see sushi chef Josh at work. Josh certainly  knows his sushi well, is wonderfully social, and will be happy to create off the menu sushi delights for your discerning palate."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, but unfortunately they were understaffed (only one sushi chef on a Saturday night) so it took almost 2 hours to receive 5 rolls (we didn't get the last roll because by this time we were late). The staff was apologetic and gave us two small dishes on the house, so this doesn't appear to be a common occurrence. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My friend came into town for a quick pit stop and she picked this place for dinner. I looked the place up prior to coming and was excited to try it out.   We started off with drinks. I got the rosé and she got the iced green tea. The rosé was light and fruity. The iced green tea was really good. I will be ordering that next time. It tastes like matcha water. It's not tea-like if that makes sense.   For an appetizer, we ordered the kara-age chicken. It is fried chicken pieces. The chicken is very lightly battered in an airy coating and then fried. I really didn't care for the sauce that it came with. I didn't dislike it but there were better options on the table to dip the chicken into. The tsunami roll came with a good sauce and the sushi chef made me a side bowl of it to dip my chicken in. It was a decent sized app for the cost. I would order this again.   For the rolls, we order three of them: tsunami, citrus, and Zen. The tsunami roll was my favorite. The roll was lightly battered and fried. The was slightly crunchy and not oily at all. Re sauce it came with was miso based and it was amazing. I used the sauce on everything. I even got the recipe. For the citrus roll, the citrus flavor wasn't overpowering but also wasn't on the mild side. It went really nicely with the fish. The Zen roll compared to the other two was pretty soft in flavor, which was nice since there was already so much going on with the other two. The Zen roll had masago on top so that added a nice crunchy and pop to the roll. The ingredients were fresh. We were there pretty late and had the opportunity to watch them prepare the fresh fish for the following day.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I was in town visitng from LA with a close friend and found this place on Yelp...sushi quality was good but could be better for the price. The uni was the highlight and we ended up ordering 4 pcs total. The sweet shrimp could be a little more moist, it was dry and the fried head was just to oily. The scallops were a bit dry as well but still had good flavor. The rolls I got to try a piece of, I couldn't tell what fish was inside as it was covered up by the sauces. The beef tongue was good if you're feeling adventurous. In any case, it's hard to say I could come back if I were Chandler again without trying the couple of other places around."}
{"text":"best sushi ive had in phoenix. fish was fresh and melted in my mouth. not the cheapest, but the best so far."}
{"text":"By FAR the best Sushi place in Arizona. It is spotless and clean. Extremely fresh and tasty and the chefs and the owner are amazing people. This is the ONLY place outside Tokyo I will eat sushi."}
{"text":"Shimogama was recommended by Liz at Marriott Buttes. It did not disappoint. The fish was so fresh and tasty. Everything I ordered was fantastic. They had Salmon belly which melted in my mouth like butter. I highly recommend you go. It small so make a reservation."}
{"text":"I am a bit upset with this place. The sushi is fantastic and I would love to have more of it, but I get denied EVERY time I call an order in. Last summer, I called for a to-go order but they wouldn't allow it because of the weather outside.....ok......so I was a bit perturbed by this and tried again last week. Mind you it is February!!! I called for a to-go order again and the man who answered said \"no, we can't do it. We are wayyyy too busy!!!\" Excuse me?! I thought this was completely unacceptable and unfortunately, they have lost me as a customer. As good as the food is, it doesn't make up for this horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 5-7 is great. Best sushi and other Japanese cuisine in the valley. Décor is simple and not snooty. Service is great and quick."}
{"text":"Sometimes the hype creates high expectations. This is what happed here. I conatantly read great reviews. So i gave it a try and i was unimpressed. The crazy roll was blah. The spicy scallop was weird and partially shredded.  Never had it like that and dont think i ever want to again. Well atleast i gave this place a try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is inviting and the service is the best of any restaurant I've been to in Arizona hands down. They are really attentive to their customers and the food was just as authentic as the Katsu I had in Japan. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"By far the most authentic Japanese food in town. The freshest sushi, house made dressings and sauces.  Service is awesome and friendly owners."}
{"text":"Al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum!!!"}
{"text":"This ous the best sushi that I have ever eaten! I will judge sushi by this place from this day forward! Small place,  great selection, freshest ingredients! Service was great. The owner was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Very cute place on the inside and the sushi was good but not  as interesting as we hoped as far as choices, ingredients, etc.  Still like Sakana better but it's far from home.  Still looking for awesome, interesting, amazing sushi near south Chandler."}
{"text":"I was in the hood and visited for lunch today.... was super impressed.  I ordered the special, which was a Japanese hamburger.   The beef was tender and delicious. The burger was huge, and had a tasty sauce which made the burger, like, super duper umami.   It came with a salad that had a tasty dressing, a bowl of rice, and a small seaweed salad.  What a delicious meal!  I didn't order sushi, but split an order of monkfish liver (!!!!!!!!!!! a favorite of mine) with the guys I had lunch with, it was sublime and wonderful.  Most of their lunch menu items are $9-$11, for the quality and quantity they served, I felt it was a good value.   I will def. be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Phoenix! The place is clean and doesn't smell bad. Fish has always been fresh. Prices are reasonable. It's always packed I would suggest making a reservation before going in."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to get sushi!!! I get the rainbow roll and they have the freshest sushi ever. It was tasty and presentation was gorgeous. I like to carryout and I am giving four stars only because I called on a Friday night to order carryout and he told me they were too busy to do carryout. I do feel a successful business should be able to accommodate dinner service as well as their carryout customers.  Just my opinion... But I highly recommend this place but I advise to call ahead if you want carryout ."}
{"text":"The place is not cheap, but it is worth it.  The best way is to go in and let the chef and owner pick your food.  You'll eat some crazy thing you would have never ordered and love it.   If you are a weekly sushi eater, this place might get a little pricey.  If you want to experience the full range of Japanese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"I love this little sushi joint. Definitely one of Chandlers hidden gems. I do think they are a little on the pricey side but If you go during happy hour it's well worth it. Service is was fast and the servers are very polite. The rolls they make with the wasabi mayo are amazing. Just makes me sad that I now live so far from this place that I hardly ever make it over there."}
{"text":"MMM Great place. Sat at the bar. Orserwd the alaskan roll, augideshi tofu, house salad and much much more everything was great. Ben sushi chef was the best very helpful and great convo. We will def come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place get packed! so I would get there early or reserve if you got a big group. There really isn't much seating, but there is a room for bigger groups. We sat at the bar at this occasion. It's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants/sushi bars that is owned by fa Japanese family. I feel like most other ones are owned by Koreans. (could be a huge generalization but it's true in many cases).   Anyways, the service is good. There were two servers and the owner was helping out as well. Two sushi chefs at the bar who look like they just graduated from high school, but they knew how to cut fish. Thumbs up. I liked the appetizers as we started off on miso soup and seaweed salad. The sushi portions are on the smaller side (6 rolls), but I think the quality is great. The nigiris were awesome and even the rolls tasted really great. They don't go overboard on sauces, so you can taste the different flavors of the fish and ingredients in it. This may not matter to you as long as it taste good overall. Also had the fried icecream which were bomb. I don't know how they make these, but I approve.   Great restaurant to try out if you are into sushi!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here by a pastry chef/owner of a high end restaurant here in town.  We had been talking sushi, and she suggested I come here.  Boy, was she absolutely dead on right.  We came at 12:30.  There was something of a lunch crowd in this smallish sushi restaurant, with a nice looking bar and tables.  We were seated promptly by, I believe, the owner.  Our waitress was attentive and quick.  We ordered a seaweed salad to start, which was very very good.  I had a lunch \"sushi platter\" which was 8 pieces of Nigiri, one tuna roll, and Miso soup for $19, an excellent value.  My wife had the \"Citrus Roll\".  She commented that it was excellent.  My sushi was fresh, well prepared, beautiful.  The Nigiri was beautifully presented, tasty and fresh.  The tuna roll was wrapped well.  Overall, I believe this was both an excellent value AS WELL as excellent food.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"The old Japanese guy who's probably the owner hates kids! I walked in with my 13 and 7 year old nieces at 5:30pm and he simply turned us away. He didn't greet us, he took one look at us said \"we're booked.\" Naively I said, well what's the wait time? And he rudely said \"everything is reserved. it happens.\" WTH? I've never been treated this way just for bringing kids! Mind you my girls are good. No one deserves this type of condescending behavior."}
{"text":"This place is great. The sushi is delicious, there's not a long wait time on the sushi orders and the employees are very attentive. I also love the intimacy and ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely would recommend this place to my friends and family, or a really nice date."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Literally can't get enough. It's a hole in the wall gem! Such a beautiful restaurant, the sushi is incredible and the food it outrageous!! So delish. I couldn't decide on what to eat I wanted everything!! I ended up doing Las Vegas rolls, Gyoza, and the yokisoba. This place does NOT disappoint and the staff are awesome"}
{"text":"Right before moving back from Tokyo to the states, I lamented my future of never having good enough sushi at my disposal. Gladly I was wrong, and realized there are plenty of good sushi places....even in the middle of the desert....you just have to find it.   Shimagamo lies unseemly in old, almost hole in the wall plaza. However, when you enter you notice the stark contrast with tastefully simple yet elegant decoration. The place is fairly small, so bigger parties (bigger than 4) most likely need reservations.   The menu has more than sushi but we were there for the sushi. Between two, we ordered the sushi combo, unagi (eel), uni nigiri (sea urchin), otoro nigiri (fatty tuna) and a few items off the happy hour menu: sake (salmon), tamago (egg) and a roll. The unagi was meaty, exactly how I liked it. The uni was buttery and the otoro just melted on the tongue. For the sushi combo, I hardly ever expect to like octopus. I was, however, pleasantly surprised it was not chewy, but perfectly textured and delicious - exactly how it should be. My only gripe is the rice although good, did not hold well and was falling apart a bit.  Our bill for some of the more expensive items came out to about $40pp and left us happily full. Definitely one of the places I've tried in Phoenix for sushi, nice selection and fairly priced with excellent service. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"In a desert state, finding sushi this fresh is an exciting surprise. Finding it just around the corner from my house makes it that much better, though that second part is really just for my wife and I.  Shimogamo was impressive. Fun atmosphere, intimate setting, friendly staff, and above all incredible food.  It was amazing the difference in quality between this place and our regular sushi spots; we are very happy to have a new place to go when the sushi craving strikes.   Will definitely be going back... a lot."}
{"text":"Food came fast. Fish was okay. Price was a high. $14 for 4 slices of tuna sashimi with no rice no miso. I was also shocked by $2.5 for a cup of hot green tea on my bill."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!  Always friendly, helpful service.  Very fresh tasting, and nice  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow. Between my husband and I, we have had some good sushi before but that was fantastic. By far the best quality we have had to date. Every piece had the perfect texture and flavor. Be sure to make a reservation though because it had a line out the door by 7:00 on a Tuesday- open table worked great for us. Couldn't say enough good things about this place. It will now be our go to sushi joint. While we both joked about it at our table, it really must be true because when we walked out we overheard another group say \"it's like Jiro dreams of sushi\""}
{"text":"Amazing find.  Great every time.  Every order is made by someone who actually cares about your experience along with a wonderful presentation.  Recommended for a group or a date if you need to impress."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona by far! Small place but comfortable and intimate.  The stuff is always ready to serve you and make sure you'll be happy and full.  The sushi here is top notch and always super fresh and delicious.  You don't even have to go for the special rolls, just a simple sashimi will give you the sense of the quality of the fish that you are getting without any distractions."}
{"text":"First time eater here and tried it with my mom. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but walking in we were greeted warmly and sat quickly; although it was only 5:00, (HAPPY HOUR)! We tried many things (pictures are attached) and each was delicious! Our two favorites were the Crazy Roll (shrimp tempura & spicy tuna) and the Saikyo (miso glazed black cod). You have to try it to understand how tastes they were! Thank you fellow yelpers for helping us find this place"}
{"text":"My girlfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner at Shimogamo.  It was one of the best sushi restaurants that I have ever been to (I have been to a lot), and hands down the best I have been to in AZ.  We did as another reviewer recommended and, after giving our server some guidelines, allowed the chef and owner to send us whatever they wanted from the sushi bar and kitchen.  All of the sushi was very fresh and some of the dishes were as creative as they were delicious. However, our favorite was the miso cod from the kitchen.  In terms of price, our bill was in the $60 - 70 for two people, with a number of dishes and no alcohol.  Yes, this would be expensive for a weekly sushi dinner, but for a special occasion it was actually cheaper than other nice restaurants that we have been to. I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi."}
{"text":"By far best sushi in Chandler! Their rolls are fresh and clean tasting- not full on mayonnaise or other western ingredients. Their food is authentic and delicious! I have been going here for years and have never been let down. Every dish is superb and worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, great quality and perfect service. Ate there last night with my folks and the four of us enjoyed every aspect of the experience. Solid, solid, solid."}
{"text":"Came here around 5:30pm on a Friday, got turned away. Not really a big deal, it's busy or whatnot. What upsets us is how we were told. We walk in and are asked for reservations by an older man by the host post. Didn't realize we needed one. Inform him we do not have one and he just shakes his head. Continues to tell us he doesn't have an availability. We ask if there's a wait and how long that might be, he chuckles and says he has too many reservations and doesn't think we'd get served. We're not sure if we're  just reading too much into it but we walked away very disturbed. We understand not having an avaliability but how it was handled left such a bad taste in our mouths. His response was rude and the exchange was very odd. It just came off as if we weren't good enough to eat there. Never had quite an experience like that."}
{"text":"A small place with a charming contemporary design and limited seating, but this has to be one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in the Chandler, AZ area.  We ordered a lot of food and they were wonderful.  I'm giving this place 5 star for a combination of their food and service! Will definitely come back.  They had the best fried gyoza ever (it was the sweet chili sauce that did it for me)!"}
{"text":"Just simply amazing!  Came here tonight with my sisyer-in-law, she had never eaten raw fish and was hesitant. She absolutely loved it and I'm happy it was here.  As a California native I have lived in Arizona 7 years and just about gave up on finding places for sushi. This place is classy, authentic and definetly a cozy traditional sushi restaurant; although it is quite elegant in the inside the real stars are the excellent service and exceptional food. The mixed tempura was hands down the best I've eaten while living here. The fish was fresh and tasty; just absolutely delightful.  I will be telling EVERYONE I know about this place, and will be visiting in my dreams until we meet again.  Try it, you won't like it you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best sashimi in North America. Truly it's a cut above. The same chef has been here for years. I will never visit Arizona without visiting Shimogamo."}
{"text":"What happened to Shimogamo? I had a good experience there 2 years ago. It was a 4 star sushi restaurant for me that time with good quality of food and service and that's why we went back there for our 3rd wedding anniversary. But our anniversary was totally ruined.  Their service was terrible, just terrible. The only thing they did right was taking order of our drinks and brought them quick. After that things just went wrong in every way. It was  like we were totally not served.   For starter, we ordered beer and they only brought the bottle, no glass although other tables got glasses. That was fine. We tried to get a glass but the waiter never came back to us, even to take orders. We couldn't find the waiter for about 10 mins so we decided to order things we could order directly to the chef at the sushi bar we were seating.  Then they forgot to bring 2 out of 8 dishes we ordered including our appetizer. My husband got his dish around 20 mins after ordering and I had to wait another 15 minutes for mine. My husband finished his drink but had to wait for 20 minutes to get another drink. We again waited for 20 mins for just for the bill, etc.. And every time we needed something, we had to wave them as they never come by us. \"Waiting\" is the word that explains our experience at Shimogamo this time.   It seemed the chefs at the sushi bar and waiter/waitress were confused about orders all the time. They brought at least 3 dishes to wrong tables. We heard someone dropped dish(es) with a big noise in the kitchen.  Even the quality of sushi was not good this time. The fish was totally not fresh and didn't taste almost at all. It's a fast food restaurant quality.  I think this was our worst experience at a restaurant ever. Sometimes we get not-so-good service or they forget our order but I've never seen my husband so disappointed before. He is a sweet person and gives at least 20% tip even if they forget our order but this time, he only left 15% tip. But I understand that after seeing him waiting miserably for his drink for 20 mins trying to get attention from them without success. Yes, we just felt ignored and miserable. A waitress even got to the sushi bar and asked the chef in front of us whether he's thirsty and needed something to drink but my husband was totally left without any drink for too long.  And for the first time, I heard my husband saying \"I will never go back to the restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Excellent service, very quaint atmosphere and the sushi is very fresh.  The miso soup and miso salad were great, not to mention great sashimi and house rolls.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant! The seafood is so fresh and the flavors are impeccable! On this visit, we decided to order non-sushi items as well and were not disappointed. The steak tartare melts in your mouth and the grilled black snapper pairs perfectly with the creamy dill sauce.  Also, you cannot go wrong with any sushi roll here, our favorites are the vegas roll (best in the valley in my opinion) and the spicy yellowtail roll. I'm drooling just thinking about all of their delectable dishes!  The bacon wrapped scallops are also a must if they have them as a special!  Words of caution though, reservations are highly recommended as the owner will not allow you to wait if the restaurant is full.  He is unafraid to tell customers to \"go away.\""}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and I always seem to forget to write a review.. but I love this place. For me, Shimogamo has some of the top sushi in Arizona  and I could come here every day for the dessert ha.  The family that owns this place are so nice and friendly, they are constantly on top of things and will assist you when needed. The atmosphere is relaxing, I like that it is a tiny little restaurant in the corner :)  We ordered the Shimogamo roll, the Panko roll and oh gosh.. I can't remember the last one we had *facepalm, all I know is that it had rice paper around it and it was very light, not heavy at all; SO GOOD!  Even their sashimi is amazing, it was very fresh and worth the money. Well, in general, this place is worth the money.  The desserts though, they have red beans and rice cake (I love both of those things) and mochi icecream.. wooooooooo! So good.  OH OH and the chicken katsu was really good too! I prefer chicken over pork, so I don't know how the pork tastes, but the chicken was yummy!  Anywho, I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in town. Make sure that you make your reservation as it gets crowded very quick. We usually get sushi rolls, they have a really good happy hour menu as well as great specials. They are very attentive, me and my husband go there fairly often and they always remember our favorite drinks and orders. I love the citrus roll as well as the spicy (both tuna and salmon) rolls. Ask for the wagyu beef, it's pricey but totally worth it, we splurge every now and then when available and get the skewers, the meat is so tender that it will melt in your mouth. My husband loves the coffee jelly as dessert. This is definitely our date night favorite place to go."}
{"text":"The crazy roll and Las Vegas roll were amazing...flavorful, bit of crunch, delicate fish...mmm next time we're going to try the spicy lobster roll- and you better believe we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Japanese restaurant! If you are planning to dine out on a Saturday night, make a reservation way in advance.  We went there on a Sunday night and made an OpenTable reservation and the place was pretty much booked.  They honor Happy Hour menu even on a Sunday and their house red wine was pretty good.  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Excellent quality and yes, you pay for quality sushi.   The owner, wait staff and chef are always friendly and extremely attentive. We have a favorite deemed the \"Saturday Night Special\" created by a chef  after we sat at the bar and sampled some of his creativity. We arrived at one we really liked and, being Saturday, adopted the name.  Great place and very unexpected for Chandler! Locals would like to keep it to ourselves but the word is out and well deserving of your business! My favorite sushi place - not snooty, great food, great service and no long wait. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about twenty times and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley and top three for Japanese (Shinbay, here, Hana, maybe Roka)   The drink prices are great and even better at happy hour.  The sushi is great but so are the reasonably prices kitchen items.  If you aren't a piggy like me you can eat here very reasonably.  We love the owner, Yoshi.  Try the boars specials, always great!!"}
{"text":"Goodness.  I can't understand what took me so long to find this place.  The sushi is remarkably good.  The rest of the food is visually stunning and delicious.  The decor is nice for the limited size of the restaurant and the service was excellent.  Pricewise you're going to spend more than your typical sushi place but when you factor in the quality you're getting a great value.     I'd recommend the gyoza for an appetizer and as much sushi as you can handle.  I look forward to coming back here multiple times to have a full sampling of the menu."}
{"text":"Alright where to start where to start....  Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it. I have been to some good sushi places that pack a punch in a 4 piece roll. The soft shell crab was okay, but only 4 pieces?!?!!?!?! Like most of their other sushi it was really salty....REALLY REALLY REALLY SALTY. the wasabi had zero potency. The scallops was chopped up...booo, some other places do that too, the worst part was how much salt there was on it. they should have called that a salt roll with a hint of scallops.. BLECH!!!  I also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...  and the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush.   my over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _\"enter random fish name here\"___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at all"}
{"text":"Little hidden treasure! Amazing food, great ambiance! Everything on the menu is delicious! This place will continue to be our sushi spot!"}
{"text":"This has been a staple for our sushi fix for the past few years however we were basically turned away this evening because they were full and had several table reservations.  This leaves a little sour taste in our mouths as we recommend this place often to our friends.   The food is great and decently priced especially during happy hour, but beware, you may be turned away, so have a plan B.  We came back another day and it was closed. There was a paper sign stating that it was closed for the day (Jan. 24)"}
{"text":"We arrived so early that we were the first customers on this particular day.  Greeted promptly and seated at the bar.  Our host, the waitress, and our sushi chef were polite and efficient.  The music I would classify as synthetic meh and the restaurant very small but the décor was pleasant.  The food was real and very tasty.  The Copper River Salmon nigiri was rich, dense, fresh and delicious.  Agadashi was served like a soup with a fried Serrano garnish.  We had a couple of the Happy Hour rolls -Shimogamo was fresh and had a surprising hint of lemon.  Crazy roll was wrapped with rice paper so it even presented very differently. The Eel & cucumber was also very nice. As a whole the food and service were very nice, but I think the prices were a bit above what I may have paid elsewhere.  Or maybe it's possible the prices really didn't seem to match well to the portions or cut of a couple of things.   It's was $70 for two of us, two beverages -not cocktails, two rolls, one nigiri, and agadashi.  Just seemed a bit steep, especially with two of the items being part of the happy hour savings."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese style food unlike most of other Japanese restaurant which may modified the sushi roll. I believe the material they use is high end. We went there for my birthday. Nothing wrong with the food service and food. But what makes me have 1 star only is because they over charge in my credit card. 71.86 $ is my total. We split into one 50 and 20.86, total 2 receipt. However they charges 50, 32 (i add tips in this one) and another 71.86.   Lucky I check the statement statement when I  pairs the credit card. And luckily, I seldom use this card otherwise I may not be able to spot this doubled charge. They should be careful.   I hate to call the bank and spent lot time for the dispute."}
{"text":"What a great find! We wanted a quick bite to eat before grabbing some groceries. So glad we stopped here. Decent happy hour and nice ambiance. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different places for sushi and Shimogamo is really what the 5 star rating is meant to be As good as it gets! The Shimogamo roll is probably my favorite along with the Crazy Roll. Mr. Yoshi is a great guy and always welcomes you. It's a hidden gem best place for sushi."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday and with folks from out of town, which is always risky when you've never been someplace before. I'm happy to say that I had a fantastic birthday dinner, and my guests didn't think I had terrible taste in restaurants.  The service here is really fantastic. Sushi places can sometimes be a bit slow, but everything here was out in no time at all. I had this fantastic roll they make with no rice, just yam batter, and the presentation was beautiful too. The entrees our guests had we're generously portioned, and really good as well. I was very happy with the quality of the fish, especially in my salmon rolls.  Our waiter was extremely helpful with their extensive saki list. I'm not a very adventurous drinker (I like craft beer and mules, and that's about it), so I was hesitant to try a carafe of their house saki. I'm glad I did, because it was delicious, light, smooth, and just a little sweet. I enjoyed it more than I like wine, and I'd definitely order it again.  I'd definitely go here again. The staff is fast and friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. This is probably the best sushi I've had in Arizona outside of far pricier places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fresh and excellent sushi! I've been going here since 2005 and always get great service and excellent food. I especially enjoy going for happy hour from 5pm-7pm and sitting at the sushi bar.  This place is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and has an intimate vibe. It's great for a date night or for a night out with some friends. It's best to make reservations on the weekends, though, because it gets quite busy.   My favorites: pan-fried gyoza, spicy tuna roll, Shimogamo roll, panko roll, spider roll, tsunami roll, caterpillar roll & rainbow roll."}
{"text":"I have lived here for nearly 10 years.  I acquired my sushi addiction back in NY/NJ and am always in search of some good quality fish.  Most places in AZ are a dime a dozen.  Nothing special, completely average and nothing to separate one from another.  But, then there is Shimogamo.  I have been here 10+ times.  This is my base for top notch sushi.  I have not been disappointed yet and I have tried a majority of their raw offerings.  Sit at the bar, grab a beer, some cold sake and prepare to have a food-gasm.  Their happy hour (7-days a week) prices are awesome.  Lots of nigiri, rolls, beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu.  For the best eats, the list to focus on is the board behind the bar.  It has all their weekly specials.  The freshest items they get will be listed up there.  Do not hesitate to try new things.  Bonus points about this place is that the owner is Japanese!  Even back east that is a rarity.  Koreans (and even Chinese) own a large percentage of sushi joints.    The chefs here are great at just making something unique for you that isn't on the menu.  We usually get a round of some of our favorites, then let them freestyle the rest of the way.    Don't confuse pricey with over priced.  Great fresh fish is not cheap.  There are plenty of cheap sushi joints with all you can eat and less than stellar grades of fish.  If you always strive for better sushi and aren't content with the imitation crab (Krab = whitefish) that nearly 100% of other places use, step into the big leagues with Shimogamo."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the east valley, possibly AZ. Chefs were great with lots of experience. HH prices are amazing. Very pleased with this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Very high quality sushi. This is probably one of the best places to get sushi in the Phoenix area. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Loved the experience. Tried two specials: White truffle Amberjack and some fancy Oysters. Also had their Shishito peppers, beef tongue, a special lightly torched roll, the black cod, some tobiko w/ quail egg and two things of hot sake.  Zach/Erin great time."}
{"text":"My friend came into town on a Thursday night for a visit, so my boyfriend and I decided to take her out for something she hadn't been able to find much of in Wisconsin: SUSHI!  We hadn't been here yet, so it was a bit of a gamble just telling her, \"Yelp said it was a GREAT place!\"   Safe to say, BEST sushi on this side of town! Great ambience, fresh sushi (we tried several of the rolls and some sashimi), had a fun time doing sake bombers. Service was prompt and friendly.  Will definitely be coming back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is a cool Sushi spot with great decor. My wife and I go here once every other month and the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona I figured that Sushi wouldn't be the easiest to find cuisine yet I was happy that Shimogamo fit the bill, as the other popping sushi joint nearby was AYCE and I didn't want attempt that feat.   When you walk in, the impression is the restaurant is very tidy and you feel at home because locals are at the bar joking with the chefs.   Of the dishes I tried, chicken karaage, rolls: zen, citrus, and tsunami, my favorite was the tsunami because the batter was lighter than the Vegas roll we were thinking of getting which would have been more fried. When in doubt, ask the Sushi chef!    I appreciated the sauces that accompanied each roll and the chef took time to explain the delicate process to yield such magical sauces.    My only (minor) complaint is I wish the menu had more pictures for us visual folks as it would have helped with choosing quicker."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in AZ by far.  Sushi expert cred: I lived in Japan for three years and have eaten sushi in large cities (Tokyo) and small cities (Yonago).  This place is REAL sushi. If you want fried cream cheese in your sushi go elsewhere. The owner is a man from Kyoto and he isn't doing much pandering to American palates.  The highlight of this place is the actual quality of the fish. The nigiri sushi is what you should order so you can fully appreciate the flavor and texture. I'd recommend the unagi, the salmon, and the escolar to get you started. All exquisite."}
{"text":"Great 1st impression. Makes everywhere else look amateur, can't wait to go back. Second time around look forward to getting a private room or table."}
{"text":"Very seldom do I give anything five stars but this place deserves 5+. Took two of my good friends to dinner here and was treated like royalty. This place has the most amazing sushi menu, fresh and beautiful display. Nothing is spared it is expensive but worth every dime. The sushi chef made certain that we knew that everything was fresh that day. Awesome experience I would definitely go there again soon."}
{"text":"Went here last night based on yelp reviews and I have to say this place was incredible I live in LA and work a mile from little Tokyo I eat sushi at least once a week and this place was as good and better than most places in LA. For my kid I always order a lobster roll here they did a fantastic job the meat was tender and moist the sauce was creamy but not over done. We also tried a few specials like the amber jack with truffle sauce WOW and the red snapper in a lemon garlic sauce was to die for. Every time I come to visit family this will be my go to place. Oh I almost forgot our server was Max he was friendly attentive and made great recommendation. Also had some albacore with a drizzle of ponzu sauce melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"First of all, I must say Sushi is my favorite food. I have tried not all but most Japanese restaurant in town. This would be the best of all among others, although it might not be perfect each time but their food is fairly consistent.   Fish is fresh, the rice cooked just right. Place is a bit small but they are usually not that busy.  I will vote this best of Japanese restaurant in town and I will recommend everyone to try at least once."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, classy atmosphere, but from almost the minute we sat down they were telling us that the food would take a very long time and that the service was very slow.  Man they were not kidding.  Drinks went empty several times, tried to order a second round of sushi only to change our minds after our waiter walked by our table without taking the filled out menu at least 5 times.  Then it took another 20minutes to settle the bill, which by the way was outrageous.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anybody.  I can get happy hour sushi a mile up the road for a fraction of the price in half the time and they will smile at me while I keep ordering.  Good food is one part of having a restaurant, its usually not the most important part.  People pay for good service and that is what keeps them coming back.  I will never go back to Shimogamo."}
{"text":"10 out of 5 stars for the Grilled beef!!! You will not be disappointed! Also love their Lobster dynamite roll. Everything else are good as well.   As for sushi, this place is ranked  #1 on my list of best sushi in town.  The place is small, so make reservation before you go."}
{"text":"First off, get yourselves ready for some vulgarity. I have a LOT of great things to say about this restaurant, and absolutely zero tolerance for some of the douchepickles who have written reviews about it. That's right:  you're all a bunch of wanna-be foodies who need to keep your boojie ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boojie ) asses glued to the bars at Ra and Blue Wasabi. You don't deserve to eat at a place like this and no one wants to hear your opinions.  I absolutely love this place. I've been looking for this place for YEARS, and it just so happens to be in my backward. I've tried a BUNCH of sushi/Japan restaurants in the area, and I've always walked away disappointed. They're perfect for you types who love to tell your friends how edgy you are because you 'LUV SUSHI OMG LOL!\" but have never tried melt-in-your-mouth toro, explosive ikura, or FRESH scallops. Your expertise lies in the fields of California rolls, spicy tuna, and cream-cheese. I don't frequent these places because they don't have what I want (the aforementioned toro, ikura, and uni), and I'd been searching for a place where I could get my fix.   Came here with my girlfriend tonight and was a little wary... but hopeful. Saddled up to the sushi bar and looked over the menu. I should preface this review by mentioning how I even found this place:  I searched for 'uni' near Gilbert, and this was one of the first places that came up. I was fiending for some uni, and nothing less than perfection would do. So here we were, walking into a new sushi place, with high hopes that were just begging to be dashed upon the shores of disappointment beach. Hesitantly, I asked the itamae about the availability of uni. He just smiled and said:  \"Oh yeah, we have it tonight!\". Furrowing my brow, I imagined that he must simply be toying with my emotions. Casting an apprehensive eye back to the menu, I noticed that they had 'toro' listed. An inquiry as to it's availability was met with a big smile and a reply of \"Yes, we have toro, and it's great!\". A similar reply came when I asked about ikura. And so, we checked off a few boxes, ordered some carpaccio, and watched the man go to work. The first few morsels appeared:  sake, hamachi sashimi, and escolar. Now I'm not hugely familiar with escolar, and was wondering what was going on when my dude took a blowtorch to it. He was more than happy to explain:  escolar is a really fatty fish so we hit it with a bit of heat and throw one of our in-house roasted jalapeno slices on top. Now, I'm pretty puritanical when it comes to my sushi... but I have to say, this shit was RIGHT. The escolar was immaculate, and no less pleasing was the sashimi and salmon. Narrowing my eyes, I nodded thoughtfully as hope began to build within my weary soul. Our rolls were delivered, and were promptly consumed:  the shimogama roll was nicely presented with a great texture of crunch and mayo, but it was the salmon skin roll that really twisted my titty hairs. It was PERFECTLY crisped, with a delightful flavor that is HARD to find in salmon skin rolls (read my others sushi reviews- salmon skin rolls is one of my go-to items that I use to judge a prospective place). In short, the salmon skin roll was fucking mind-blowing. No sooner had we polished those rolls off then our next plate came:  toro and uni. I'm not going to lie to you... I was praying with every ounce of my soul for these pieces of sushi to suck sleepy ass so that I could continue my search and keep yearning for perfection... but then I'd be lying. I would be blatantly lying to your face, dear reader, if I told you right here and right now that it was anything less than spectacularific. The toro *LITERALLY* melted in my mouth- a few chews, a few swishes, and the meat had dissolved into a fatty delicious vapor which danced tantalizingly along my tongue. The uni was no less skeet-inducing. The good itamae showed us the package that it had come in, and was all-too-pleased to inform us that:  \"This box was shipped in today. It was probably picked out of the urchins earlier today. We have people who come in and buy entire boxes of this... I don't know how they afford it, but they do- they call in advance and order a whole box of this.\" After tasting it, I know that the man is worth every grain of rice in his nigiri. As I mentioned earlier, I was CRAVING uni, and Shimogamo knocked it out of the park. It was exactly what I was looking for. Then came my ikura (with a quail egg floating happily inside), and I ate it. I ate the shit out of that gunkan-maki, and I wanted to tap my girlfriend on the other side of her shoulder and steal the other out of her hand when she turned around. Because I'm devious like that and I care only for my own happiness. Yeah I said it.   Well shit. I'm out of space. Come eat at Shimogamo. Now."}
{"text":"Two words....AMAZINGLY FRESH!!!! Ok ok I seriously love this place. True sushi not fried covered in spicy mayo sauce. The owners so kind and sweet!"}
{"text":"Shimogamo is BAR-NONE my favorite Sushi place in the Valley.  It's not as inexpensive as some, but the quality of the sushi is truly impressive.  I've gone to every sushi place I can in the valley (I live on this side of town) and many places outside of Phoenix (Seattle & San Francisco being the most notable) and I'd place Shimogamo against ANY of them.  I'd recommend thier signature roll, as well as many of their sushi pieces, as I've had sushi there that I don't really like anywhere else (quail egg & uni).  Go there.  Try it.  It's a small intimate place with great service and even better sushi.  Reservations probably needed for the weekend and they even have a larger table in the back (a NICE back area) for larger groups.  If there were six stars I'd give them that."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to leave a review because it's small and at times you need a reservation because it's THAT good and I just don't want to attract more people there.  That said, it is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the east valley due to food quality. You will not be disappointed with the food here. Freshest sushi around and rice done right. This is the kind of sushi you can skip the soy/sauces and enjoy the flavors on their own.  Shrimp tempura melts in your mouth.  Sushi chefs are friendly and always offer suggestions/make sure you are happy. The host can be a bit picky about seating/accommodating (when reservations take over the restaurant) so I've sadly had to find elsewhere to go last minute on a few occasions. I also wish they had daytime/more open hours as I find it difficult to schedule going there as often as I'd like to. If it were open during the day I would be there once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"4 for atmosphere, 3 for food and service  I found this place on Yelp for dinner last night and my friend and I hung out in our care a few minutes before they opened at 5pm. We were quickly seated and we took a look at the HH menu and figured out what we wanted. We shared an order of the shrimp tempura, and I had a California roll and spicy tuna roll and my friend had a Vegas roll and rainbow roll. Our server was very nice, but the time between his stops at our table and how the food came out was really long. It took probably 10 minutes for our appetizer to come out, and then from the first sushi roll coming out, it probably took another 10 minutes to get all 4 of our rolls on the table. They weren't overly busy, but it looked like food was coming out to different tables at different times which seemed strange. My rolls were okay - nothing mind blowing. While I waited a lot, I was fascinated by a little private room they have in the back which was super cute and chic. The restaurant has a very NY vibe to it. I'll probably return"}
{"text":"First time we came here, the older gentlemen turned away our party of 6: no seats available. Second time around, we were able to get a seat.  Now, I was thinking: WOW, this place based on reviews and not being able to seat us previously; must be great.  Well, not really....  The sushi is ok, nothing special.  The rolls were decent, but again nothing that would excite me about coming back.  Service was good and they offer happy hour pricing 7 days a week.  Now while that sounds great, the $7.50 rolls on the list are pretty small; so yes you pay a lower price; but it's the equivalent of getting 1/2 rolls in some places.  Overall service was good, but the sushi was just ok and not enough for us to travel from Tempe here again."}
{"text":"I love having my go to Japanese Restaurant Shimogamo, where the fish is always fresh, quality excellent and the prices are reasonable for Arizona (remember we live in the desert). The Service and Sushi Chefs are always on top of their game.   We frequent here at least once a week whether for Friday lunch or weekend dinner.  always to note: their cooked foods are great and if you don't like fish/seafood, they have other great options, chicken, beef etc."}
{"text":"WOW.....Hidden gem in Chandler tucked away in an un-assuming strip mall.  This place is the Bees Knees, the Cats Pajamas aka just plain straight up amazing.    First off it's small and intimate and it is highly recommended to make a reservation if you plan on dining during peak times.  I made one on Open Table and was promptly seated by the friendly older gentleman. Service was excellent and couldn't be more pleased.   The food is definitely the highlight here. Chef Aaron clearly takes pride in his craft and everything he prepared was delicious.  The salmon sashimi was fresh and oh so good. A huge surprise was the Beef Tongue small plate.  WOW, I will probably order this every time I come back.    Safe to say this is now the only place in Chandler I'll be having sushi from now on."}
{"text":"Looking for the best fishy in town? I thought so. It's here (Shimogamo).  Michael, one the Sushi chefs, is excellent and very good company, too. Everyone that works here is vert nice and accommodating.  Very small place; in fact, it is the smallest sushi joint I have ever been to. Be sure to call ahead and make a reservation, or you may be waiting.   The portions are rather small and the prices high, but the fish quality of Shimogamo is peerless."}
{"text":"We went to the Shimogamo for the first time on Friday night.  A dour man who appeared to be the manager approached us and said \"We have no more space.\"  Not a greeting, not offer of a wait time, not anything but \"no more space\".  We left without having an food because we were definitely not welcome; more of an inconvenience the manager."}
{"text":"Really great place. Great service.  Well, when we first came in, the guy said the wait will be at least an hour. But we were willing to wait. So we sat down and the guy suggested we go do something to kill time, so we did. We walked around Lee Lee's Oriental Market for a while. Well, before I left Shimogamo, the guy told me to give him my number and he will call me when a table is ready. Well, we got lucky and someone canceled their reservations so we got in. During our meal time, everyone was so polite. The food came to us in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered Tonkatsu and it was very delicious. I liked it. I will come back soon, but earlier this time haha"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley! They have a great selection of rolls, sushi, and sashimi and the quality is unbeatable. The two sushi chefs are very friendly and knowledgable. They have happy hour every day with some great specials. We won't go anywhere else for sushi!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience.  Make a reservation this place is small and gets full quick.  Food was excellent.  Service was very good, not a big staff, but they take care of you.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Since New Times voted them Best Sushi in Az. Small cozy atmosphere we always sit at the sushi bar (Tip if u want most experienced chef sit to far left of bar) really good happy hour 7 days a week 5-7. All of the fish is not older than 48 hours. I can not tell you how amazing the service and food is. My only negatives 1. busy on weekends 2. Kinda pricey if you don't go during happy hour. 3. Recent sushi chef changes. But with all that if u want sushi that's on point then go here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying WOW!!!! Talk about great sushi......I have been to a ton of places in PHX,Seattle, San Diego, San Fran etc. and this is by far the best I have had...I'm a little apprehensive on actually posting this just because there is limited spaces to eat at this place and I don't want a ton more people showing up but I thought that would be a little selfish and I don't really have a ton of people reading my post so it couldnt really hurt. But if you are in the area and you are reading this I would recommend you take a second and try this place out. Again great sushi and great service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Been here several times.  Get there early because it fills up.  They have great happy hour prices.  I have had jellyfish on their specials menu and it was great.  Also, I forget the name of them, but they have a Japanese Oyster that it awesome.  This is my favorite place for sushi in the Phoenix Valley.  Never had a bad experience, but I have shown up a little late without a reservation and been told that they are full for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Love my sushi! This place is close to my home and gets very busy so I highly recommend a reservation or go super early.  The sushi is always fresh and cold.  I've been to other sushi places and it is warm and not cold like sushi is supposed to be, depending on the type of sushi you are eating. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The inside is small but very trendy and nice decor. Good place for a nice date or for a quick bite of sushi. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I can proudly say I've never been disappointed. Try for yourself, can't wait to hear your thoughts!"}
{"text":"Brought the out of town in-laws back for lunch. They raved about this place since their last visit in '12. I don't blame them it is ah-mazing! Fresh fish all around. Ordered the Las Vegas roll, Citrus roll, and several others which included sashimi. The chef was very considerate and cooked up a few dishes for our 16 month old. I can't stop praising this place. Service was excellent as always. If you want the best sushi in the east valley come to Shimogamo!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice now where the owner won't seat me because I have a child. He says the place is full and reserved and both times it's been at 4-5pm with the entire place empty. My friend also told me he did the same thing to them with their daughter. I have been there without my son and the food is okay and I went back because I live right there. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the freshest sushi I've ever eaten. I stuck to the plan of \"order what's on the special board\" and \"take the server's advice\" and it didn't fail me. At all.  I love me some spider crab. Most places it's over cooked and/or gets drowned out by the other flavors in the roll. Not this time. Loads of crab flavor.  And the unagi was sublime. I normally pass, as the over-sweet sauce just doesn't cut it for me. But I gave it a shot. Wow. Skip the sauce. Just enjoy the incredible flavor. Wonderful.  Their rice-less roll (tsunami?) was sublime. Every bite was fresh layered on top of fresh. The tempura battering was light and flakey. Highly recommended.  The only strikes were selection. Two of the items we ordered weren't available. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I think that speaks to the the freshness. They order enough for the day. And we ate late, so I'm not terribly surprised they were out.   That, and the under-chef convinced me to forgo the ikura with quail egg in favor of tobikko with quail egg. It was good, and in his defense he offered to not charge me for it if I didn't like it. But I did like it. Just not as much as I would have if I would have capped my meal with the ikura/quail combo. Mine may not be traditional. And it may be heretical. But it's fab. So I'll get that next time and stick to my guns.  Because, oh yes... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Shimogamo is the best sushi you can get outside of Scottsdale without paying $100/person. It is run by Chinese folks and I cannot say that it is authentic, but it is far and away the best place to have decent sushi in Chandler (and there is some truly horrible sushi in Chandler).  Not a large place so big parties may want to book ahead."}
{"text":"We went to Shimogamo last month on a Saturday, We sat at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef was very informative about their fresh calk board specials.  We ordered one of each.... Amazing is the word! Cute little place, great find in the east valley.  If you are into the cream cheese fried sushi this place is not for you.  I would recommend this place to a sushi purist."}
{"text":"Great!  I was in town for work and needed good sushi.  I was not disappointed!  Michael at the sushi bar was awesome!  I come to Phoenix for work often and and happy I found this place and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm not a local, so I chose this place based on the other reviews. I was really pleased with the sushi. I also had the fried calamari and it was really good. I would definitely go here again if I was in the area. It's a pretty small place so I was happy that I made a reservation. When we arrived, our table was waiting for us. The service was great."}
{"text":"Just one word to describe my first experience at Shimogamo (note I said my first as I will return for an encore) AWESOME! The sashimi was fresh. The unagi was delicious and the cut rolls were heavenly.   Tightwads beware...this place is pricey but oh so worth it. I normally spend about $60 for two on sushi. This place hit us for $96 bucks and that includes only two small bottles of Kirin..."}
{"text":"How nice to have such an elegant Japanese restaurant so close to home. The food and ambiance was five star. I took my son who loves all things Japanese and who has recently been to Japan out to dinner for winning first place at the 9th grade science fair (Yay!!). This was a night we will remember. He ate a disturbing amount of food and loved all of it:  spicy potstickers and 3 kinds of sushi along with Mochi vanilla ice cream for dessert. I had tofu vegetable soup and green tea. So nice on a cold rainy night. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"First time trying this spot today and I enjoyed it very much! The ambience was a very relaxed feel which made me feel very comfortable. So after reviewing the menu, I ordered a shrimp tempura and I enjoyed that very much as my starter. The batter was great and it had the perfect crunch to it. The gyoza was something I also enjoyed. Everything was basically spot on from the salmon sashimi to the tuna poke we had. Everything tasted so fresh! Also ordered the wagyu skewer and it was just amazing. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi in Arizona.  The place doesn't look very fancy on the outside it's a big shopping plaza with another Chinese restaurant in Indian restaurant in the same location but the sushi here is something that you will not be able to find anywhere else in the Phoenix metro.  Without too many fancy lights or ultra expense decor, the sushi here is always fresh and melts in your mouth.  It's also affordable compared to other high end places in town but they still can't match the quality of the sushi here."}
{"text":"Really sad that we got treated so rudely when we arrived tonight.  I had come to this restaurant just a week ago and we were greeted coldly by the old man seating folks, but nonetheless my partner and I were seated and we enjoyed the combination sashimi and spicy tuna roll.  Excited to bring my parents to this place as they came to visit me from out of town, we were rudely greeted by the grumpy old man and all be told us was \"no tables available! Wait will be one hour!\" Damn...sorry we walked it at the wrong time for you! It's too bad that the service here doesn't compliment their good food. The food is overpriced, but I don't mind paying it as long as the service is good. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. We have been here twice now and it's amazing. The sushi chefs are awesome and can recommend anything you're in the mood for and even make something off menu for you. You have to get the yellowtail, fresh and melts in your mouth. This place is the best sushi spot in AZ. Reservations are recommended since it is a small place. Restroom situation is a bit strange, but sushi makes up for it."}
{"text":"I'm always down to try a new sushi place and Shimogamo doesn't disappoint.  You'll find the normal Japanese dishes on the menu, from teppanyaki to miso soup and they have a full list of sushi for you to choose from.  But you'll also see some more inventive items, including the three colored fried tofu, which is actually very good.  I've also had the tempura udon noodles and it was delish.  The restaurant was clean, the servers were friendly and fast and the prices are reasonable.  Give it a whirl- it's a great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Very good sushi.  We've never done a nigiri omakase experience here, so no head-to-head comparisons with other sushi joints around the States, but based on the food we have ordered, we have a good idea of preparation and quality.  Pretty darn good for Arizona.  I don't believe it's the best in the Valley.  (My wife would disagree, she believes it's the best nigiri in the Valley.)  But almost every piece of nigiri we've ordered here has been very good, aged appropriately, appropriately cut, and well balanced.  This place is NOT a superior sushi establishment based on their rice.  Texture and temperature are mediocre, but at least it is seasoned correctly.  I have had a bad experience with the uni here.  I would not recommend it.  But, every oyster we've had here has been expertly prepared and delicious.  The variety of seafood is pretty good if you include any specials they may have.  It is pricier than other sushi joints in town of like quality, so another reason it is 4 stars.  No real huge complaints here (except the uni).  My father-in-law, frequent traveler to Japan, also approved of the sushi here, so there's that as well."}
{"text":"This place has an authentic quality that is hard to find these days. It is the best quality sushi for miles. I would highly recommend trying it out. Ive never been dissatisfied here (:"}
{"text":"Panko roll was excellent with a touch of heat from Wasabi.   Rainbow roll is a great treat of several items including shrimp, yellow tail, and salmon.  Las Vegas roll is always a favorite with eel sauce.  This place is hidden next to C-Fu Gourmet."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try this place because they were closed at 8:30pm. The hours listed here and on their website say 9:30pm but they closed early. Pretty bummed they closed an hour early without any explanation as to why."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant is run by a Japanese family. The service is exceptional. I love the thin slices of lemon in the water. The sushi is incredibly fresh. I ordered the Chirashi bowl for $25 and it was incredibly filling. It was full of delicious slices of fish. You pay for what you get here and it is all incredibly tasty and high quality. The restaurant is cute and usually packed. Reservations are highly encouraged. They have a cute table in the back for larger parties as well."}
{"text":"I came here because a couple of my classmates enjoyed the place. After a long day we decided to try this place out. I ordered the Spicy Salmon and the Crazy roll. I would say the rolls do taste fresh and light. Happy hour gives a modest $1-2 off regular prices on rolls. Overall, I thought the place was OK.   The main reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because my party of three was asked to leave to make room for another group. I have never been asked to leave a restaurant -- it was very abrupt and kinda rude. My party said that we never experienced something like that before. This is not a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I'm definitely going back... It's a little spendy but the service was fantastic! We sat at the bar and the chef had us laughing almost throughout our whole dinner. It's a very romantic place for a date night as well. The food was awesome too."}
{"text":"Alright... before I start my personal review of this place, I'm going to comment some of the 1 star reviews I read.   I am myself a small restaurant owner and I truly think those are the best ones to start with - and the most interesting ones as well.  So here we go...  \"They refuse to take my to-go order because of the weather\" - well YES, this is arizona, it gets really hot outside and even more in your car. You're ordering sushis with raw fish; it's obviously dangerous to bring that home in a hot car! They want you to enjoy and appreciate their dishes right out of the kitchen/sushi bar- there's nothing wrong with that!  \"They refuse to take my to-go order because they were busy\" - it's better in my opinion to take care of your customers who are sitting in and waiting their food than rushing everybody and lower the quality. I understand the disappointment, I would be frustrated too but seriously, people, don't leave a 1 star review just because of that, without even trying the food!   \"We arrived at 5pm, the place was empty, they refuse to seat us because it's all booked\" - well YES, if tables and bar seats are reserved, they can't seat you! It's a tiny place with a very small amount of space and seatings. It's pretty common in France (yes I'm French) to be refused in restaurants on busy nights like Fridays or Saturdays if you didn't make reservation in avance. That's something very \"American\" - I want it, and I want it now.  How would you feel about your table being taken by someone else when you made a reservation?  \"Our bill was $$$ for the amount of food we got.\" - well- YES, this is the real deal. Real Japanese food. Not a \"sushis\" chain where you get big fat rolls and stuff to blow your mind. Everything is made at the order, they always have -very- special products that you can't find anywhere else. If you want fast and big sushis, there's other places or even the Fry's a block away with huge plates for cheap and low quality products.   \"They refused us because we had kids\" - well, To be fair, I don't think sushi is appropriate for young kids. They don't offer a kid menu for that reason, I guess.   From my prospective.  I repeating myself, this place is small and authentic.  We've been going there with my boyfriend every week for the last couple months.  First of, it's a walkable distance from our condo. Very convenient.  We get there usually on Monday nights for happy hour.  We've always got seats at the bar since Monday is probably a \"slow\" day.  Sushi chefs are friendly, recognize us and have the best suggestions//samples. Feeling special and recognized is very valuable for customers. I really enjoy it myself.  Happy hour menu is more than just decent, we mostly order from it and try something from regular menu too.  Service is cool, not exceptional - but once again, as a French girl, I don't like to be interrupted every two minutes by the waiter to check if I have enough ice in my water or if I need anything else. If so, I will make sure to catch somebody's attention.  Guy at the door - looks like he's the owner, isn't RUDE like I read in other reviews. He probably doesn't master English and is very shy. I know what I am talking about - I'm myself not very \"friendly\" at first just because of the language barrier.  And he is Japanese. He has different manners that we are not used to... very polite and discreet, doesn't talk or smile much.   We enjoy the atmosphere and our time when we go there.  Food is high quality, presentation is gorgeous in your plate, products fresh and selection right.  NEVER been disappointed.  So yeah, if you want to go to Shimogamo, you probably should make a reservation...  This is top notch Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Hell ya! Best sushi in town. My husband and I always have fun and eat great food at Shimogamo. Fresh & tasty sushi, homemade curry, great service and awesome Chef Al. They also have great cooked dishes too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi you can find in the Valley.  The owner is from Japan and I believe they import their fish from Japan.  My husband and I went in, not expecting much from the food, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The pork spare ribs were delectable with a slightly crunchy sweet crust.  We didn't try much else except the fish because it was so darn fresh!  You need to get here early on weekends because there are not too many tables.  Parking can be tough in the strip mall with the dim sum place next door.  I would give this place four stars but it is pricey for the portions."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex. The sushi was awesome, the drinks were very reasonabally priced, we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice, kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar. The service was great! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh fish and food. I have never ever had one bad bite here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great menu and ambience. I ordered the California roll and chicken lo mein. Both dishes were made fresh and were delicious. Wife ordered salmon teriyaki and loved it. I tried the green tea ice cream for dessert and it was tasty."}
{"text":"I liked the food and had a good meal. The decor and the seating arrangements were a little off though and I never really felt comfortable. Its tucked away in a strip mall so I guess its one of those place you have to know to find and they were busy."}
{"text":"Shimogamo whole-heartedly deserves to be named Best Sushi in the Valley by the AZ Times. It was some of the best sushi I've ever eaten. I made sure to call ahead to set a reservation for our group of 10. The owner was very kind and thru broken English let me know they don't like to split checks for that size [but our server let us do it anyway haha]. It wasn't terribly busy since we picked a weeknight. Pretty much everyone in my group ordered sushi. The few who did not received their food first. My friend and I decided to split spicy salmon, citrus, and another roll. Despite my initial hesitation in ordering it, I loved the citrus roll - wasn't too citrus-y, had a great balance of many flavors [umami?].   The place missed the mark though with their service. I totally understand bringing a group to a sushi joint where everything is created to-order can be a hassle and time-consuming. But how they went about serving us all was annoying. Everyone ordered at the same time, and slowly but surely they brought out everyone's food one at a time. By the time the first person who ordered was done eating, my friend and I barely had touched our rolls. Wish they would've done a roll for everyone and then go onto any other rolls ordered. That way we were't starving for 45 minutes looking at other's plates.   Spent ~$25 for myself and was definitely worth the cost though."}
{"text":"If ever in the chandler area and sushi is on your mind, shimogamo is best in town.    Although it's in a strip mall the service is awesome, sushi chefs are amazing, seafood is always fresh, and although small, the place is all class."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised when I walked in to this place and saw two Caucasian sushi chefs. I didn't know what to expect at first, but I later realized that it doesn't matter your ethnicity,  any one can be a sushi chef.  I ordered my usual at any sushi restaurant,  the Chirashi. It was not bad. Definitely not worth  $29. I wish the sushi was more presentable,  for instance, standing tall in my bowl rather than laying flat on a bed of rice. Thicker slices would be nice. Way too pricey for Chirashi,  especially for how they serve it. The sushi rice was delicious. Not like what I've had before. The sushi chefs were very chatty and it seems a lot of regulars dine there. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly place.  Nice varied menu.  If the portions were larger, or the prices lower, there would be no problem with 4 or more stars.  The rolls were skinny and small.  The squid salad came in a cute small square dish.  I ordered the White Truffle Amberjack $15.00 Fresh sashimi of Amberjack drizzled with truffle oil and salt, served with micro green and Ponzu sauce.  I enjoyed it.  Very nice.  6 thin slices of baby yellow tail.  Looked good, tasted good.  Temperature of the fish was just below room temperature (as far as I could tell).  So it was not cold and not warm.  Also order some sashimi.  Small pieces at a large price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best sushi in Chandler. We had the crazy roll and I loved it. The salmon is great and I would recommend it. And also sake bombs are guest, happy hour here is the best!"}
{"text":"Updated 8/15/2008   This place used to be the best but it has gone down hill terribly while the prices remained very high.  They used to have the freshest fish and now they have some really foul tasting tuna and salmon which has gotten me sick. They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, this will stop me from ever going back.  Service has gotten pretty bad also. The new waitress they have was about absent minded as can be.  The only things I still like at Shimogamo are the live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) and Sea urchin (Uni) but on the live sweet shrimp they have gotten very stingy as they only give you one head and they split the body in 2 pieces.  The establishment stank like rotten cabbage and I've noticed it being not well maintained behind the sushi bar. Another annoyance is that they are only open for lunch on Fridays now.  There are much better options around and at this momemnt Sushi Kee 3 blocks east on Warner (at Rural) is a lot better."}
{"text":"QUALITY SUSHI  Nuzzled in a little what seems to be a run-down plaza is a teeny tiny upscale sushi restaurant. When I say teeny tiny, I mean it. Its seriously, just small tables that wrap around the sushi bar area and that's it. Can't be more than just a hand full of tables in there. But boy am I happy that I found this place so I don't have to go all the way to Scottsdale for quality sushi.    Must try the toro, wagyu beef, and fresh fish! Also, if you haven't had fresh wasabi, try that too. The portions are small, but the quality is high.  Service is relatively fast and friendly. You'll even see the owner hosting and serving. There aren't may workers, but there aren't may tables either so it doesn't take forever for you to find someone or to get your food.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Price: 5/5 (you pay for what you get) Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Was really surprised at how absolutely rude and dismissive these people were. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"My Japanese girlfriend recommended me to this place, the food is very good. The place is nice and clean. I will surely go back next time when I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I never noticed it before and I found it by looking in Yelp for nearby sushi with good reviews. We could have eaten everything on the menu. Fresh and delicious, the service was great. The place is small so I recommend going during the week."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by here.... ohhhh i miss Sushi Kings in Asia,,, but anyways,, we are in Chandler.  Sushi here was a 3.5 i would say, Nice atmosphere but a little cozy. Staff very polite.  We tried a few different items, and was a little surprised the portion = 2 pieces where most places are min 4.. anyways,, they were very tasty.  We will be back, but since the portions are small, that will double our bill since we would order double up on each item.  Shrimp Tempura was very light n crispy,,,,  Would have like to try the oysters, but either no longer carried or out of season ??   Cya next time.."}
{"text":"This review is for their Friday lunch service.  Lunch date with my hubby and as suggested, we got there right at 11:30 to snag a table. We both ordered lunch trays and an order of the yellowtail tuna. I ordered the Crazy Bowl, which had mini fried shrimp over spicy tuna and rice. It was very delicious and healthy servings of both proteins. Hubby ordered the black cod tray, which tasted similar to sea bass. It was very buttery and luxurious. It was also served with a small side of what we described as whipped potatoes.   Both trays were served with salads and miso soup. I didn't really care for either so he gobbled it both up for the both of us. The yellowtail sushi was 6 pieces, just enough to share. It was pretty tasty and they were not skimpy on the filling at all.  Next time we will try to make a reservation for this cute private back room. Would be fun for a group dinner. Service was attentive and quick, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona hands down.  Nothing else to add to it.  Small place that keeps delivering the best sushi you can get leaving all the fancy places around the phoenix Scottsdale area in the dust.  Worth the drive and income here from Tucson, sometimes without a very good excuse to drive up to the area."}
{"text":"The food is great but homeboy has recently become a reservation nazi. I showed up at 5:15 (they open at 5) and the place was nearly empty. My group of 4 was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. If you go, you might want to make a reservation so you don't have the same experience."}
{"text":"Went to grab some sushi with Jared R. tonight.  He recommended this place from reading the reviews on here.  We started off with the miso soup which was pretty good.  Lots of Tofu and the broth had a nice flavor.  We both ordered some sake bombers to gulp down with our meal.    We got 5 rolls which were all really good.  The first set was the yellowfin roll and the fiery shrimp.  They both were really good.  The fiery shrimp was exactly as the name said.  It had just the perfect amount of kick and shrimp.    The next roll to come out was the Tsunami Roll which was my favorite.  It had a fried outside and lots of flavor.  The sauce that came on the plate was more than just a decoration.    Lastly we had the big and spicy roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They both had a great amount of kick.  The big and spicy was very good and the best part was the pickled jalapenos on the top.    Overall this place was really good and I would totally go back again.  Thanks again for another good find Yelp.com"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Why did it take me so long to try this place!!!! I've gone to CFu for decades and never remembered to Go here. I'm so glad we did and can't wait to be back. It's a small intimate place. Seems be reservation only. Husband and I ordered a variety of small plates and appetizers. Can't wait to go back and try more. The dining experience isn't something you would expect in Chandler. Great service."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in AZ so far in my opinion. The Citrus Roll is unreal. I have been here 5 times now, and each time was great, minus one visit. That one time, they were slammed and my rolls were not on par with how they were on other visits.   Last night, we went for my best friend's b-day, and Yoshi (the owner I think) gave the b-day boy a free \"Stamina Drink\".. I had a small sip it. Tasted like isopropyl alcohal on ice with a splash of grape flavor. So.. pretty legit.   On the way out, Yoshi told my friend, \"Your life is wrong!\" then burst into laughter. This was hilarious to me. I asked my friend if maybe he meant, \"Your life is LONG?\" maybe just a pronunciation error?? But WRONG is much funnier. Good Times :)"}
{"text":"I get tired of the same chain sushi places so I tried this place out the other night. They do have happy hour every day from 5-7 even on the weekends. That's pretty cool. I didn't love any of the appetizers or rolls that I tried, in particular. I'd say it was just average. We were also stuck sitting at a tiny 2 top table in a room (almost seemed like a  private party type of room) where a party of about 10 women were already seated at a large table in the middle. So it was pretty loud and we eventually had to ignore or laugh at whatever the ladies were so loudly discussing. One thing that could be easily changed is the name of this place. I can't pronounce it and definitely can't remember it to tell a friend. I wasn't super impressed like I said, so I guess that won't be too much of a problem after all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki with the side dishes. You have to order them separately. I had rice, miso soup, small salad and a tuna salad. All the food tasted fresh and yummy! My favorite  thing was the mochi ice-cream!! I had the strawberry! The mochi was a perfect texture and thickness!! The servers were very nice, and friendly. My husband and I were seated in the back room, away from the main room, and it was nice and quiet and relaxing! I want to go back and try some sushi rolls soon!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and really some of the best Sushi we've had in the Phoenix area (moved here from Chicago about 3 years ago).  It's a little small, so book a reservation or try to go at a time that wouldn't be too busy, otherwise you'll be waiting ;)  My hubby is a non-sushi eater and they have quite a few menu items that he really enjoys as well (especially the pan fried gyoza and the Kara-Age Chicken (small plates)."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and customer service. Very cozy little place. Great for a special occasion!  It's a good idea to make reservations, especially on a Friday or Saturday. Their specials are great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A Great secret place tucked away in a strip mall. You should go and discover for yourself."}
{"text":"Why do people love this place? It was way overpriced. Sushi was typical. Didn't feel like it was worth it at all. Don't get me wrong. Food was fine but with those prices I would expect a lot more. It doesn't help that the complex it is in doesn't say high class.   Overall, middle of the road sushi, high class price."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh, and they have some interesting, well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic, fresh, and delicious.  Outside of the scallops, their food was 'Meh'.  Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.  We were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.  Overall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service."}
{"text":"First the good: the sushi. Can't complain about the food. Will go again. Now the bad: service sucked. So many things went wrong on my first visit that I can't even type it out. All I will say is the sushi was good enough for me to go back but I will be sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Food is excellent here.  I had the beef tongue, salmon skin sushi roll, and the black miso cod.  All was tasty and beautifully executed.  The service is very attentive.  I would definitely come back again.  I regret not finding out about this place sooner."}
{"text":"if money was no object then this place is just superb. the space is clean, dark, and modern, but i think i'm biased because a friend of mine designed the interior. i love the sushi bar area where you can watch the chefs while you eat. the service is attentive and the sushi is wonderful. the caterpillar roll (one of my favorites) is just awesome along with everything else. the downside? the spicy tuna rolls are tiny and the bill is always large!"}
{"text":"This place is very racist agaisnt white people.  We noticed other asians getting special treatment and since we were white it was a back of the bus experience.  Everything from wait time to seating selection, quality of food and general rudeness: there seem to be 2 sets of stadards.  If you are caucasian please boycott this place.  My wife and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!  We just found our new sushi spot.  We decided to try it, never been here, but thanks to our fellow helpers we did and we were not disappointed.  Service was great from the get go and didn't miss a beat. The sushi guys were fun to talk to and explained a lot of the choices.  The waiter recommended some great wine for the wifey and provided some of the best customer service I've experienced in a long while.  Great ambiance, and very good flavor with everything we had.  The pork dumplings were tasty, sushi was chilled and delicious and the yakisoba was excellent."}
{"text":"***Make reservations**  This place is the smallest sushi spot i have ever been too lol BUT really really good. If you don't call you can be waiting a while. It's kind of hidden so keep an eye out.  We sat at the bar top. The ambiance is nice the lights are real dim, good spot to take a date also. The sushi was amazing from the servers to the cooks to the guys making the sushi they were on everything and very quick.    If I lived in AZ I would go more often  but if in the area go check it out."}
{"text":"While on a business trip to Chandler, AZ I found this little gem.  The sushi was fresh (the salmon melted in your mouth), but beyond that the service was excellent.  I sat at the bar and ordered from their happy our menu.  While sitting there I noticed the sushi chef very engaged with the other customers at the bar.  He new them by name and was servicing them some interesting rolls that were obviously not on the menu.  Being the outgoing person I am I asked and was introduced to some great chef inspired rolls.  The Shimogamo roll (that is on the menu) was amazing.  It was fresh and just fantastic.  Sitting next to me was a regular who ordered a Diamondback roll (being in AZ) that was great.  They make a sauce with roasted jalapenos and other asian inspired ingrediants.  Awesome.    The service was excellent, the staff was fantastic and the customers great!  This is my go to place while in Chandler.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Sometimes it is hard to find great sushi in the Phoenix/Tempe area, or anywhere without an ocean...but we really enjoyed Shimogamo.  Very small, and in a random shopping mall, but the eating experience is worth it.  They also have happy hour 7 days a week from 4-7!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic and high quality! They make their own fish stock here instead of using instant and the attention to detail is evident in other dishes as well. This in not your typical sushi \"bar\". The atmosphere is much more intimate. You will impress your date if you bring them here."}
{"text":"Sushi AND happy hour? Ok, you got my attention... =)  This place is super close to my house and I'm actually in this area all the time yet I've never even heard about it. I met my friend here for happy hour last week. We ordered so many rolls that I can't even remember them all. The philly roll, las vegas roll, shimogamo roll, and much much more and ended with some oysters.   We sat at the bar and everyone was extremely friendly. I thought that the sushi was actually reallyyyyyy fresh. I love Philly rolls so I always have to try them everywhere I go. This was probably the best Philly roll I've ever had. It was everything I asked for. lol. They also have drink specials as well. My friend ordered some sake while I got their Red house wine. Two of those glasses and I was gone. lol.   I felt like it wasn't HAPPY hour because even with happy hour pricing it was still pretty expensive. I think everything came out to about $70+. Doesn't sound like happy hour pricing to me. lol.   I would definitely come back though. I really loved everything and it's so close to my home. I left completely satisfied. =)"}
{"text":"Ok so on my second attempt (this place is super small and gets really busy on weekend nights: the first time we came without reservations and they were full to capacity) to eat here was enjoyable. They have really good sushi and a friendly staff! Great for a date night or small groups."}
{"text":"awesome sushi, good happy hour, good service.  ORDER THE JAPANESE FRIED CHICKEN AS AN APPETIZER. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"The food was really nicely presented and tasted just as good as it looked."}
{"text":"The owner was horrible. I came here with my husband today to try this place out. My husband was really excited and looking forward coming here. We recently moved from San Diego, we have been looking for good sushi place so when my co-worker told me about this place I was really excited and couldn't wait to take my husband here. I took my husband today (nye) around 5:45 p.m  they had several open seats, we asked if we can seat at the bar however, the owner told us that he had no room and that we needed a reservation. We asked how long the wait would be and he said that he won't have anything available till 8:00 P.M.!!! We left disappointed (especially my husband) I called just to see to make a reservation and the owner told me that he can reserve two seats at the bar at 6:30 P.M!!! I wanted to go back but at this point my husband is already upset and very disappointed. We felt like the owner didn't want our business and we don't know why. We were both wearing a semi formal attire and look decent. So, I honestly DO NOT KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T want our business!! It was a very horrible experience, we have never been treated like this anywhere and we've been to much fancier places like Fogo de chao, Flemmings & etc. We will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Small family feel with friendly staff.  Sushi, steak, tempura all excellent...pricey and I wish the portions were bigger, but worth coming for the occasional splurge on tasty Japanese fare."}
{"text":"I didn't expect any good Japanese food to come out of Arizona, but Shimogamo proved me wrong. I've only dined at Shimogamo twice, but the quality and presentation of their food was so awesome that it left a lasting impression on me. Apparently, many other people felt the same way because it was packed on a Tuesday night that I came!  The rolls and sashimi are excellent and even the kitchen foods are great. Honestly, I would recommend everything on the menu if it fits your fancy. I personally like to stick to rolls and sashimi and then finish off my meal with a bowl of their porridge (which is really ochazuke, for those who know what it is).   I highly recommend Shimogamo. I picked it as my last meal in Arizona, if that says anything about how awesome it is!"}
{"text":"Very nice! I only had a small 5 piece roll but it was very delicious...the layout of the building is a bit odd but it was good sushi!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family while on vacation in AZ. We love Japanese food, especially sushi. The food was GREAT, service was GREAT and it was a quiet little restaurant which is always a bonus. We were a party of 6 and we got our own little area that was a little more isolated, which I loved. I'd recommend this place to all Japanese food and sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"This was an incredible sushi experience.  I had never had sushi from anywhere but Panda Express so I was in for a true treat when dining in at this very aesthetic and clean restaurant. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly, suggesting different types of rolls and sushi for my party.everything was so fresh and well made. I highly recommend the Crazy Roll and Rainbow Roll."}
{"text":"Don't go here! Because once you do...the bar will be raised, and you will forever need/crave/save up for this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricey - But you're eating RAW FISH. It's worth it.   The Salmon Sashimi was lovely : ) Big Fan of the YellowTail.  I also, had the Beef Carpaccio (I know, I know), which was to die for...and I am a sushi snob.  The fish is super fresh, the owners were attentive. Any comments about the owner being a snob might be true...but I honestly liked the guy. It's his place, and he knows what he's talking about. Basically, he's allowed to be a snob.  Just go - You'll love it and you'll agree with all the other 5 star reviews.  Now, if you need someone to hold your hand, and artificially smile at you while you slam your sake bombers and eat your deep friend Las Vegas rolls - This might not be the place for you. Go back to Mill."}
{"text":"Make a reservation. This place is a gem and everyone knows it!   The sushi chefs not only know what they're doing but they're hilariously entertaining. Fast service, yummy food and good people. #winning   Oh, the also have waygu beef on occasion and whoa buddy...give yourself the gift of beef because Yum!"}
{"text":"This swanky little sushi bar was just the ticket on a Tuesday evening for Happy Hour. Shhhhh, don't tell everybody or it'll get too crowded. But wait... Tell everybody so they stay open. Everything was absolutely delicious and fresh as can be. We sat at the bar and watched our chef wrap and roll like nobody's business. I can't wait to go back. Best sushi in this area for sure."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in Simogamo but that is probably just because my expectations were too high since there are so many reviews raving about this place. I am certainly not a sushi or Japanese food expert but I thought that the descriptions of their rolls sounded kind of boring and unoriginal. So, I went with the sushi sampler instead which is 8 pieces of nigiri and a plain tuna roll for $19. Clearly not exciting stuff but it ended up that I loved all of it! The strength of this place definitely is the freshness of their fish. All of it tasted like the very highest quality. One of them was a fish I had never tried before (already forgot the name, ugh) and I really loved, one was mackerel which I usually can't stand but this one was very mild and tasty, and once was octopus which was the best I have ever had.  Another plus was that they do offer many other Japanese entrees besides sushi so the hubby was able to get some teriyaki spare ribs and that put a big smile on his face. Their prices were a little higher than our favorite sushi place but still reasonable. The service was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The ambiance was not as nice as I was expecting but again that was based on the rave reviews... really for a mom and pop joint in a suburban shopping strip it is pretty nice. I was a little surprised at how small it was - this is for sure a date night place, it wouldn't really work for a big group or family meal.  So, even though it probably won't replace Mido as our go-to sushi place (seriously they are so cheap!)  I would definitely return to Shimogamo just for the quality of the fish. If you like sashimi or nigiri this is the place for you. If you prefer places like Ra with all the crazy rolls with a bunch of stuff in them and sauces drizzled on them or ayce type sushi places then this may not be your best bet."}
{"text":"Service was AWESOME!!! Food was pretty good. Not great, hence the 4 stars. Had the spicy yellowtail and the tempora roll. Both was really good. Rest of the table was teriyaki chicken and the calamari. Teriyaki was good, calamari was excellent!! FYI Yelp has this listed under Teppanyaki restaurant it's NOT Teppanyaki style."}
{"text":"The edemame, gyoza, mussels, the little chicken tidbits, udon, crazy roll, yakisoba - were all great!!! You cannot miss the plum wine - a must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here several times. The food is well composed, fresh and the quality is consistent. The service is always on point and the atmosphere is sleek and clean."}
{"text":"Incredible and very authentic!   The best sushi I've had in Arizona and I've been to many places and many other great locations."}
{"text":"I've been trying to shrink my \"To-Do\"/\"Bookmark\" list on Yelp.  Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.  Shimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.  Needless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!    I love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint.   The service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.  The best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!  I've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  If you disagree, send me a compliment with your suggestion."}
{"text":"I just called to place an order for pickup and was told \"no, we're too busy.\" Not please back later but \"no!\" Their sushi is decent but will not be returning."}
{"text":"We were basically pushed out of the restaurant because we had kids. The hostess was rude and I was excited to try this place but I won't ever be back due to the way I was treated tonight when I walked in with my kids. Horrible."}
{"text":"So, I don't know why I left such a short review last time, but this place definitely deserves more of my attention, because they truly are awesome. Whenever we travel, my husband and I usually make it a point to try and find a good sushi restaurant. The truth is, I no longer want to do that because I am so satisfied with Shimogamo! As funny as that sounds, I know, strange to find sushi of that quality in the desert, but, it's there!   First off, this place is ALWAYS busy, if you go on the weekend, you will want to make a reservation for sure. In fact, you usually find a group of Japanese dining in the restaurant (a good sign of authenticity in my book) We've become such regulars, we have developed a nice relationship with the sushi chef and owner. They totally make us things off menu when we ask them too, (we have some favorite Japanese dishes we can find other places, far away, but not here) and they always do, and they make it well! For instance, one time they got in some fresh Sea Robin, we ordered the sashimi and then afterward they went ahead and fried the whole body for us to munch on, so good!!! (something we had seen at a restaurant in Vegas)   So, what to try? Uni. if uni is your thing, you'll want to get it here. It's always fresh, and AMAZING....if it's not up to par, they won't serve it. (you don't want to eat runny uni, fyi, but you won't find that here)   I never fail to order the Escolar (on the HH menu as well) it comes with a smoked pickled jalapeño on top, which at times can be really spicy, but sooooooo gooood....that's always a must for sure.   All of their sashimi is fresh and of the highest quality, and Zach, their head Sushi chef, often brings in fun, fancy ingredients to play with every now and then. (we got baluga caviar on top our uni last time! ) Every now and then he'll get some special fish, such as the sea robbin mentioned above, Spanish mackerel (aji)....etc. In fact, it's good to follow their instagram as they often post what specials they have, and what special ingredients came in for the week (@shimogamoaz)  Some of our favorite plates from the kitchen: absolutely have to get the truffle amberjack.....it's to die for. And we ALWAYS order the beef tongue, it's so good....be sure to dip it in the lemon juice they bring out with it!   As for service, they are a great bunch of people, but be forewarned, sometimes at their busiest times (think weekend evenings) service can lag a little. But, I think they may have recently hired more help, because the last time we went, there was a new waiter and service was spot on the whole night.  Bottom Line: You just can't go wrong with Shimo...."}
