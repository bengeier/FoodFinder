{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday with my partner.  - Considering its location, the food was very inexpensive, which was a very pleasant surprise. - The food was very good, especially for its price. We had a burger and a quesadilla, both of which were great (in size and quality).  - The fries we both got on the side of our meals were extraordinary! - It was not busy, or overbooked. The atmosphere was very nice, and the waiters were very friendly. - The waitress we had was very English friendly, and even offered to replace my menu with an English one (unnecessary but very polite of her to suggest).  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this again to anyone visiting or living within walking distance of the restaurant. A perfect place for a casual, lazy weekend lunch. We will absolutely be returning again, probably many times over!"}
{"text":"Petit endroit très sympathique, le personnel est très gentil et la décoration est superbe. Les plats sont tous a 5$ avec possibilité \"d'extra\" pour quelques dollars de plus. La portion est généreuse, on peut \"être plein\" qu'avec une seule assiette. Mais pour 5$ pourquoi se priver!! :) Le prix de la boisson gazeuse est raisonnable (3$ à volonté) mais les boissons alcoolisés sont dispendieux.  J'ai mis 4 étoiles sur 5 car j'ai commandé le burger classique et ma viande avait les contours calcinés. Ils ont du m'en refaire une autre (sans problème). Ils se sont excusés des inconvénients et mon burger de remplacement est arrivé rapidement. Mais c'était évident donc ils n'aurait pas dû me le servir en premier lieu.  Expérience très positive, j'y retournerai!!!"}
{"text":"The low price was already amazing to begin with and the food was even better. Kick ass drinks too."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The service was horrible waited almost an hour for food and it was not even busy. Asked the waitress about the time and all she had to say was \"its coming\". Everyone who came after had their food way before us. Terrible service."}
{"text":"For a 5 dollars meal, expect a 5 dollars service. It's my second time there, when we got sit at our table we waited a good 20 minutes before having service and the restaurant was almost empty. After 30 mins we asked the girl who sat us at our table if the server could come, she said; \"yas yas it's juste that other people came before you and he is serving them first, be patient.\" So I said; \"Ok... Well can we get water then, we've been here for 30min and we haven't got nothing to drink yet?\" (it's was 32 degrees outside). She said, packed with attitude; \"I'll go tell him but as I said he's busy with other clients right now, I'm not the server.\" She clearly could've bring us water or at least apologize, the restaurant was near empty and she wasn't even busy herself. Note: she was also eating chips at the entrance waiting for new clients. Wow, after 40 mins the server comes. Service was 0/10 at this point. When I was done and the server took my plate back, he literally took my utensils and threw them in my plate! Literally threw them. I looked at my 2 friends and we just couldn't realize what happened, it wasn't a fast throw, it was a piss-off-kind-of-throw. I'm just making this review to let the owners know that this wasn't right and even if you offer 5$ meals you should at least treat customers right."}
{"text":"Been here each of the two times I visited Montreal, and for the price you really can't go wrong with Cinko. Portions are somewhat small, so if you are a bigger eater I would go with a burger or hot dog (or get two dishes). The menu is limited, but I suppose that is why they are able to keep prices so low. Service was prompt and friendly. I enjoyed everything I had here and would come back again."}
{"text":"Les plats sont bon en terme de rapport qualité prix, en terme de quantité pour bien manger il faut deux plats sinon on reste sur notre faim et finalement le service laisse à désirer, ( ils se sont trompés dans les plats, dans les factures et le temps d'attente était très lent. J'essaierai un autre resto du type avant d'y revenir."}
{"text":"Lunch at Cinko   Place is empty and easy to pick ur sport on a Saturday during lunch time.   Food: Menu is simple and  a lot of choice for 5-7 dollars,  Food quality:don't know yet...we hadn't got any food yet..almost 30 mins waiting for 2 tacos and waiters r busy doing nothing....hoping my food will be yummy  Finally got the food..cold.cold...cold...not sure why it took this long...caribean taco is awesome..above par..  Fish taco -fail Portugese  chicken - fail fail  Food quantity : decent for taco, it's worth the price  Customer service : so for didn't  get any water yet almost 10 mins...waiting waiting.. sitting at the patio on a hot afternoon ....finally found a waitress and asked...  Not worth wasting ur 1.10hr lunch .."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Canada, and I was so excited to go to the place and try it, our waiter was very nice, but the wait was so long to get our food, when we got to the place, there weren't people sitting around us, and then everyone came and got there food right away, we were still waiting for at least  an hour for our food. This was very upsetting."}
{"text":"5$ per plate for a restaurant located on Saint-Denis? I'm sold.  Cinko is located in the heart of the Quartier latin on a street usually buzzing with events and festivals, but the reason it attracts such a large clientele is mainly because it's cheap.   I went on a warm summer evening and managed to get seated quickly although the restaurant was full when I arrived. The decor was fancier than what I expected and had a slightly edgy and creative vibe. It would be ideal for a younger crowd.  I had two of the most popular items on the menu: the watermelon salad  and the chicken with the sweet potato poutine. The salad had too much seasoning but the chicken and poutine were well cooked. The portions were big for the price and after one entree and one main, I didn't feel hungry enough for a desert even though the offers were very tempting.  Overall, I would go again if I ever find myself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Beau concept, nourriture très agréable :) Bel endroit pour manger entre amis à bon prix."}
{"text":"OK; let's start by stating that I am NOT some high brow snob, bashing a burger joint.....this place just ain't good.  I was reading reviews of where to find a good burger for a good price in Montreal, and this place had great reviews, so I thought that I would give it a go.  One common comment in the reviews was that the service was slow and not the friendliest. I have to disagree. The service was the best part of my experience. It could be that I was there before the dinner crowd (5:15pm); who knows, but the staff was quick, attentive and friendly. The food is another story. I ordered the \"Classic Burger\", which comes garnished with American cheese (processed cheese slices...OK, not a problem), lettuce, and bacon. All this seems OK, until you take a bite, maybe 2.....let's see if third time is a charm? It wasn't until my 4th bite that I actually got to ....meat? All bun with a small patty. What ever kind of beef this was, had all sorts of gristle and hard bits that I don't think you're supposed to eat. Dry and tasteless.  It came with fries (thin, shoestrings....which were fine, not spectacular). I ordered a side of Mac'n cheese (because a couple of reviews raved about it, not because I needed fries and pasta). The Mac'n cheese was completely flavorless. It was like the sauce was thickened milk with a yellow crayon melted in, for colour. They sprinkled a bit of minced green onion on top.....that was about the only taste it had. When I asked for catsup, I got a couple of take out packets. The bill was only $7.50 (I had nothing to drink). Sounds like a good deal, right? Wrong. I would have actually preferred a Big Mac combo.....same price, tastes better, and larger portion.  Unless you are some 19 year old college kid, wanting a cooler place than Mac D's to hang out....I'd give this a pass."}
{"text":"Je suis allée plusieurs fois au Cinko et j'ai été déçue à chaque fois. La 1ère fois, le service était extrêmement  lent et confus (ça s'est amélioré depuis). Par la suite, les portions étaient souvent décevantes. Les assiettes sont trompeuses. La poutine au chorizo (qui n'est plus sur le menu) était garnie de seulement 3 minuscules morceaux de chorizo... Les linguine bacon et ciboulette manquent de saveurs. Toutefois, le taco de fish and chips était bon. Bref, je vous conseille plutôt le restaurant L'entrepôt qui a le même concept, est meilleur et plus généreux!"}
{"text":"Notre serveur était très absent et la bouffe, médiocre. Grosses portions, belle ambiance et beau décor, mais ce n'est pas assez pour que je veule y retourner."}
{"text":"Le concept estr simple: tout à 5$. Les plats sont simples mais valent le détour. Évidemment, à ce prix, les portions ne sont pas énormes, alors je recommande de commander une salade et un dessert (ça revient à 15$, toujours abordable). Ça se complique lorsqu'on décide de commander de l'alcool, la facture monte rapidement. Autre que cela, le service est génial, assez rapide mais pas trop et nous laisse le temps de profiter de la déco un peu rétro mais surtout très originale! Essayez la terrasse pour bien profiter de l'atmosphère de St-Denis."}
{"text":"Gosh I am so full and so blissfully spaced out now after all the good food and drinks, and phunky music I wanna just rate this and attach my comments from my Instagram"}
{"text":"Highly recommended if you wanna grab a quick bite on St-Denis street. All dishes are at 5$, and I'd say it's half of a regular portion. For a tapas size dish, it's a pretty good price. The ambiance is nice with a hipster touch and the staff is very welcoming."}
{"text":"I went here attracted by the rumour that all their dishes are served at 5$!!!  With the atmosphere of the place, i was not disappointed. Not sure what the theme is but its funky, hip, and cool!   With the menu, it is true that their dishes are offered for 5$, however usually portion isnt that big. Well, its adequate for 5$! You can choose add ons and that will augment the price. They also have all you can drink fountain drinks for 3$ i believe.   The drinks are NOT 5$ however. I didn't order any drinks so i cannot comment on that.   I ordered the tacos (pretty good, has rice in it, unusual but pleasant flavour), the sweet potato poutine (SO GOOD, hope the size could be a bit bigger tho), and salmon salad (this was the miss of today's order. Although salad was fresh and dressing was ok, salmon was way way way too salty. So unless you reaaaally like eating salty, i would not recommend it.)   Service was quick and pretty good.   Overall, pleasant experience, i want to try l'entrepot next time to see which place i prefer, but I prob will come back to try their burgers next time!"}
{"text":"Le restaurant vaut la peine pour ceux qui ont un appétit raisonnable. Nous avons commandé trois plats à deux et nous avons mangé à notre faim.  La poutine aux haricots tempura était délicieuse, le service rapide et agréable. Une bonne option pour les petits budgets au coeur du quartier Saint-Denis!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed! Love their $5 menu. Food wasn't the most incredible I've ever had but it was still pretty great and better than anything you can get for that price. Two of us ate REALLY WELL for $27."}
{"text":"The five dollar price tag didn't mean you're sacrificing portions. Getting a salad along with a burger plate was enough to satisfy. The service was very friendly, and the food was very good. I can't speak for their meats, but the veggie burger was top notch. The atmosphere is very nice, if only a little loud due to the music. But that might've because we were close to the speaker. So, check it out folks."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute GEM! Best and most fun restaurant on Montreal!!! You must go here- $5 dishes and $12 happy hour pitchers all on a patio, who could ask for anything more. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Can try anything on the menu. $5 is a real choice makes this place a very budget friendly while whatever you is delicious"}
{"text":"Great service, bilingual servers (ask for an English menu if you need one, they have some), inexpensive food and drinks. The only catch was that in order to get food you had to order a drink; it could be the $2 fountain soda but you couldn't just stick with water. I had the quesadilla and found the portion to be pretty small. If you're looking for more substance, the General Tao chicken looked like a good option. The Ferrero Rocher \"begniets\" were to die for imo."}
{"text":"Love to come here with my friends whenever we're broke. They offer few varieties of food at $5. I usually order their portuguese chicken, salmon salad, and sweet potatoes poutine and they are delicious for the price. Atmosphere is nice and fun! :) Plus, waiters are usually friendly and fast. Although, the portion may be small for some people, you can add extra portion for a few dollar which is great!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Very wide choice of food to eat.  I thought the portions would be really small and would have to order at least 2 dishes and I was wrong.  1 dish per person is really enough.  J'ai beaucoup aimé cet endroit.  Très grand choix menu.  Je croyais que les portions seraient petites et que je devrais commander au moins 2 plats mais non.  1 plat par personne est suffisant."}
{"text":"Really like the concept of small 5$ portion, especially as a small eater myself!  I'd say stick with the salad, and fresh produce inspired options. We tried these 4 items : Gravlax salad, Ceasar salar, Fish Taco, Shrimp and Beef burger.  The salads were great, full of flavour and ingredients. The taco was good, and the burger disapointing, a frozen McDonalds like dry patty with 2 shrimps. I don't mind the burger being a bit smaller perhaps and getting a nice fresh -notfrozen patty of meat.   Oh well, would come back for a salad! (Or perhaps desert?)"}
{"text":"I would go back for the sweet potato poutine since I quite like the fries and sauce, but the cheese curds were NOT FRESH, shame. Grilled chicken was dry & bland as well."}
{"text":"Tout est à 5$ mais certains plats ont des portions pas grosses. Si la faim est là miser sur les poutines, burger et le dessert le pouding au pain, ça cale. Mon amie a mangé dans mon assiette car ses choix avaient donné place à une assiette quasi vide, et concernant les desserts \"verrine\" il y a une grande différence entre les photos et la réalité, la portion est minuscule... il y a des restos concept 5$ à Montréal bien plus intéressants."}
{"text":"Pretty good!! The mojitos are AMAZING!! Pretty regular priced, 9$ for most drinks. The whole thing is that it's \"5$ for a meal\" but you do have you buy a drink to get the deal. If you got a cheaper drink I'm sure it would be even more worth it. The portugais chicken was a pretty small portion but my friend was very satisfied with her deep fried eggplant burger! So yummy!"}
{"text":"It is impressively cheap compared with last week in the US. The bar guy called Kevin is really handsome and nice."}
{"text":"Je suis allé visiter l'endroit dans le cadre de la nuit blanche du Festival Montréal en Lumière. On devait accueillir les clients jusqu'à 6h du matin et on m'a refusé l'accès à 3h du matin prétextant que c'était une fête privée. Pourquoi annoncer dans tous les médias alors?  Il y a beaucoup de choix pour avoir du plaisir è Montréal, Cinko n'est pas un de ces endroits. Désolé."}
{"text":"Love the concept here. I love trying a bit of everything so small $5 portions is perfect for me. The portions are large enough that 1-2 of anything will fill you and a small dessert shared with friends is the best way to end it off.   On a side note: The wait staff here is extremely attractive. I would come again just to see that eye candy."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a 3.5 (if rating just the food), but the service was great and they have really nice decor as well, so I rounded up.  At five dollars an entree (hence the name), this place is a steal, and definitely a good option when looking for good but cheap food. I had the Portuguese chicken, which came with a side of either salad or fries. It was pretty good, and beautifully presented, but the bottom of my chicken was kind of charred ): I also had the bread pudding which was pretty tasty. I've never had bread pudding before, so I can't compare but I thought the bread pudding was a bit hard. Still, the sauce was good.  Will probably come back to check out their other selections!"}
{"text":"Staff were very inattentive and the music was far too loud. It's questionable whether the drinks were anything but blended ice. Food was terrible. Not even justified by the very reasonable price. You are better off saving your 5$ and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"3 stars and a half ! The concept is really good! Les portions sont parfaites afin de pouvoir essayer plus qu'un plat. Je teiuve juste qu'il manque une explosion de saveurs quand on prend une bouchée, mais c'est vraiment pas mauvais! Essayez le tacos antillais !"}
{"text":"Cinko.. Translation: $5 menu Unfortunately other then the low price I wasn't impressed by the food.   We tried 3 different plates and all had the same problems.. Little taste and luke warm feel.   I'm always one to give a place a second chance but I might just skip this one.  Note: at least I ate on a terrace"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night. Then I've been terrible experienced. When we came to this restaurant, a waitress lead us to seat where front of door even if there is other seats. And she urge us to get out quickly. We just had stay for 40minutes! I have never been experienced like this situation in everywhere.  Honestly i satisfied with food. However this service is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Great wine selection! Great quality food at a good price! Sit outside and you can people watch or sit indoors in a really hip atmosphere and enjoy the music. the decor is pretty cool. They've sharpied everything from the floor to the toilet bowls!"}
{"text":"Hard to find fault with anything that costs $5++ in Montreal to be honest. Had fish tacos which though not remarkable in taste, more than made up for in terms of value.   The poutine gravy is a different story though. Am inclined to believe the cook made a blunder as it was the saltiest dish I'd ever eaten in my life. Would definitely come back for the cheap eats."}
{"text":"Says 5$ but not it's 5.55 ans plus u have to buy a drink u end up takin a pitcher with a friend split and order 2 sides plus extras bill is 35$  better to go to Jardin de Jade In China Town for under 15$ ans be full.Mac and cheese wasn't cheesy Pinacolada didn't  taste at all like alcool"}
{"text":"Hot dog & macaroni, pourquoi pas ?  Fish&ship + boeuf : miaam 2 plats, 2 délice buccales. Totalement abordable et dj merveilleux. Wow"}
{"text":"Long overdue review!!  Went there because I was on a budget,  and wanted to go on a date . So i yelped a cheap spot and Cinko came up! Why not try it? Okay so there was a line up, and it was raining, not fun to be waiting in line for what seemed an eternity , but it was only 15mns. I guess on a Saturday afternoon that's not long at all!   The place it self is quite small, but I didn't expect much for a 5$ din din. We sat in the back very close to a nice couple. mind you the place is very small.  The menu had different things which is really good for indecisive people like me! I thought everything was 5$ but the more you add things  the price will either go up to a 1$-4$. Cool thing is that they had free refills on fountain drinks! That's a total plus in my books.   I ordered a Burger Surf and Turf (beef patty and I believe 2 Panko fried shrimps) 5$  with a side salad instead of fries , my boyfriend had  Burger classique with a poutine instead of fries which came to 7.50$ , his fountain drink was 3$.   It took forever to get our food, but since im a chatterbox I was able to use my talent to kill time! The waitress was nice, and gave us our refills fast enough.   The food tasted good nothing to go crazy about but it was good and the atmosphere was chill. The place mats are old vinyls I dig it! Since I never order desert I decided to go for the fried hazelnut chocolate donuts. I don't recall the exact name. Ohhhhh it tasted like heaven! There was a mint mousse which  I wasn't too fond of it.  Total was about 25$   Yes this place is a must go if you are on a budget and just wanna go to a decent place with an inviting atmosphere! I suggest ordering 2 things if you have a big appetite as the portions are small.  I will definitely  go back!"}
{"text":"Un repas à 5$? C'est possible! Mais c'est pas juste un repas à 5$!! C'est un délicieux choix d'assiettes (les entrées, les plats principaux ainsi que les desserts sont tous au même fabuleux prix) variées et exquises. Je craque à chaque fois pour le burger fish n' chips mais tous les plats auxquels j'ai goûtés sont excellent! Les seuls points négatifs: la file d'attente trop longue et la musique trop forte les fins de semaines. Sinon, la déco est de très bon goût (j'ai copié leur idée de mettre des vieux vinyles en guise de napperons chez moi!) et le drink \"Sherlock\" est un incontournable!"}
{"text":"Pour des assiettes à 5$, j'étais étonnée de la quantité de nourriture qu'on nous amenait. On avait pris trois assiettes à deux, pensant que ça allait être des portions \"tapas\". Mais je me serais contentée d'une seule.  J'ai pris le burger végé, qui était excellent, servi avec une généreuse portion de frites. Mon conjoint a pris le Ciabatta au tofu grillé, lui aussi servi avec des frites. Son sandwich était plutôt sec, par contre. Comme 3e assiette, nous avons commandé une poutine au haricots (verts) tempura, une combinaison étonnante, mais pas méchante. Les Ferrero Cinko en dessert sont à s'en lécher les doigts (non mais, chocolat aux noisettes Ferrero, sauce menthe/chocolat et friture, suis-je au paradis?).  Nous sommes allés un mercredi soir et nous avons quand même dû attendre une vingtaine de minutes avant d'avoir une place. Le service était impec' malgré l'achalandage. Par contre, étant assis juste à côté du DJ, il était pratiquement impossible de se parler.   Bref: bon, pas cher, bon service, très achalandé et très bruyant."}
{"text":"Nous avons probablement été chanceuses, puisqu'il n'y avait pas d'attente lors de notre arrivée! Si vous hésitez entre la terrasse (en saison) et l'intérieur, les deux valent la peine! Nous avons choisie la terrasse sur le côté du resto (plus tranquille et juste parfaite). Une aventure pour trouver les toilettes à l'intérieur avant de partir nous a appris que c'est tout aussi jolie sinon plus dans le resto! Côté service, il ne faut pas être pressé, mais une fois commandé, ça va vite.   Le principe du 5$ est génial et la qualité n'est pas laissée de côté. Nous avons essayé les rondelles d'oignons Ville-Marie et le général Tao qui étaient excellents. Le grilled-cheese canard et oka tout aussi bon quoique un peu sec. Mon point enlevé va au fish taco... je sais que c'est 5$, mais du poisson pané congelé! Really! Le reste des plats étaient géniaux, mais celui-ci est a éviter si vous êtes habitués à de bons fish tacos.  Puisque l'alcool semble faire monter la facture, séparez une bouteille de vin ;)   Un endroit à essayer avant un show dans le coin. Vraiment beau, bon et raisonnable!!"}
{"text":"Une bonne place avec de la bonne ambiance. Mon amie et moi sommes tombées sur un serveur qui était complètement débordé, mais il a été attentionné malgré tout.  Une place de choix pour déguster une sangria lors des soirées d'été et profiter de la terrasse. L'inconvénient majeur est définitivement les longues files d'attente à chaque fois qu'on vient comparé à d'autres restaurants. Je recommande le Cinko quand on cherche un restaurant où il y a de l'ambiance, mais qu'on ne veut pas trop déboursé pour la nourriture.   Le personnel est friendly et j'ai vraiment apprécié la fois où j'avais oublié mon cellulaire et ils ont pris soin de le mettre en lieu sûr jusqu'à mon retour."}
{"text":"Excelent value for money.  Great service, good food and nice ambiance.  We ordered a hamburger, a salad and, a tempura. We liked all three dishes.  The food took a while but they warned us as we sitted that the kitchen was slow."}
{"text":"On etait  vendu jusqu' à notre dernière visite :( Ils ont changés leurs nachos si bons pour des chips commerciales, les rondelles ont plus de friture que d'oignon. Le service, de l'hotesse qui  prend les noms avec de l'attitude  (ns regarde,  rit quand on lui  demande le temps d'attente) à la serveuse qui nous apporte de l'eau 10 minutes après avoir eu notre table et un autre 20 minutes pour se faire remplir nos verres...en plein soleil sur la terrasse... Par contre, le burger végé avec fromage de chèvre est tjs aussi bon et les prix à 5$ super!"}
{"text":"Very artistic and modernistic design, for that I'll forgive the drink+food package deal. Unlike some people claims, I find their caesars extremely smooth with gin and they definitely did not cheap out on alcohol. Overall a pleasant dining experience with lots of seating space, prompt service, and upbeat music."}
{"text":"Belle place sur St-Denis le concept est plus qu' intéressant des plats variés tous a 5$. Les portions sont tout de même raisonnable et il y a tout de même une bonne variété de plats. Les boissons et cocktails sont on peut plus dispendieux et il est possible d'acheter une bouteille de vin .  La place est tres belles a l'intérieur comme a l'extérieur ou il y a une terasse qui longe la ruelle.  Mon amie a prix le poulet a la portugaise et moi g prix le hamburger les deux avons changer la frite pour une poutine au chorizo. La portion était petite 3 a 4 bouche au plus mais pour une portion d'accompagnement et le prix ça vaut largement la peine. La mousse au chocolat  a été partagé à deux et le mojito framboise vaut le detour.   Je nirai plus au mcdo a coté ! Les 2  avons été satisfaite et avons mangé à notre faim.  Endroit à revisiter."}
{"text":"While I was looking for my next culinary adventure on Yelp, I've noticed a picture of Cinko's Ferrero Rocher dessert. I didn't need anything else, they had me at Ferrero loool    It was everything I expected: Given the location, I was expecting a student friendly environment (I was probably the oldest around) and music a little bit higher than the average and this is exactly how it was.  I went there with a friend and we were seated at the bar (I really do not mind that spot, actually it's my favourite), the staff was very friendly and the service was extremely quick. I ordered a pitcher of beer with the fish and chips tacos and of course the Ferrero Cinko. It was good, simple and efficient what more could you ask for? I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. For the price you can't go wrong. I had 2 items off the menu for my girlfriend and I and I felt like I needed to order more of something just to bump up the bill. So we did. She ordered a mojito and I ordered a chai tea. It doubled the bill and I was cool with that and it felt more right...(I know...poor English)  I would definitely hit up this place again for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cinko is a great restaurant for a very cheap meal. Everything on the menu is literally $5.00 for a $12 portion.   I've been there a few times and have had the braised beef sweet potato poutine (my favourite). The beef was always tender, and the sweet potato fries perfect with the well seasoned gravy. I've also had the soup (I believe it was a cheese soup - I don't see it on the website anymore) but it was also tasty.   The service is always great, music good, and the decor is fun with its 60's Warhol feel.  This is definitely a go to for a meal on a budget - that being said, I will add that the drink menu is on the pricey end - but for a $5 dish, I'll excuse this."}
{"text":"Ok so, this place is amazing. It's crap, it's tasty and there's vegan/vegetarian options. We got a pitcher of beer for 15$ as well, really fantastic."}
{"text":"La nourriture bien qu'abordable à 5$ chaque plat est assez bon. J'ai mangé la salade de saumon Gravlax et c'était très bon ensuite j'ai commandé les 2 tacos de poisson qui était excellent le fait que ce n'était pas du poisson pané à contribuer à ma satisfaction du plat. Pour terminer j'ai commandé le pouding au pain pour dessert avec une boule de crème glacée et c'était bon.  Mes amis ont commandés le burger et le poulet portugais et ils ont bien aimés.    Ce nouveau restaurant sur la rue St-Denis devrait bien marcher :   Bon concept 5$ chaque plat peu importe le plat.  Très bon emplacement sur la rue St-Denis près de l'UQAM et de la station de metro Berri-Uqam.  À la rentrée scolaire les étudiants de l'UQAM devrait se précipités (déjà samedi soir c'était presque plein) vers ce restaurant avec ses prix défiant toute concurrence et sa bonne cuisine.   Ce restaurant offre une excellent alternative au fast food au même prix (5-10$) !  English part :  Even if it's very cheap as 5$ every plate, it is good food. I ate gravlax salad and it was excellent, then i order the fish taco and it was excellent, the fact that it wasn't fried fish help me like it better ! For dessert i taste the bread pudding and it was good.  My friends ate the burger and the portuguese chicken and they all liked it.  This new restaurant on St-Denis street will be success because :  5$ any plate is an excellent idea.  The restaurant have an excellent spot on St-Denis Street near UQAM university and Berri station.  In september, all the students of UQAM will run to taste this cheap restaurant with good food despite cheap prices.  Probably if the place have good success they will open  more locations west side.  It's an excellent alternative to fast food for the same prices ( you can eat for 5 or 10 $)."}
{"text":"Bastante lleno para un domingo a la noche pero no hay muchos lugares abiertos a esta hora. Atención rápida y correcta. Nos sentaron en la mesa larga y lamentablemente podíamos escuchar las conversaciones de al lado, pero no fue tan terrible. La música estaba un poco fuerte para mi gusto. Pedimos una burguer végé con papas fritas y una quesadilla de queso con fritas y cerveza . A las 22 nos avisaron que cerraba la cocina, así que hay que ir antes de ese horario."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and it turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our recent trip to Montreal. We weren't exactly hungry and so a place that sold food for $5 sounded about perfect. We were seated quickly, and luckly, we had been there before the lunch rush from the college crowd nearby.  The menu was a bunch of cards held together by a ring, like the side/beverage/dessert menus you'd see at the end of the table for some restaurants. The plate coasters were record disks.   Our party of three ordered a mint, cucumber, ginger-ale mojito; a Mount-Royal sangria with blueberries. I am sure I have the names wrong. Just go by the descriptions. For food, we ordered the hot dog with mac-n-cheese -because, obviously, mac-n-cheese- the grilled salmon, and the farfalle pasta salad.  The drinks were mediocre, to be honest. They were good, but sweet and lacking in alcohol. No, they costed more than $5. The Cinko name didn't apply to drinks, at least not ours.  The farfalle salad was, depending on your taste, either about perfectly dressed, or too sour.  The mac-n-cheese was not as cheesy as I expected -but for 5 dollars, what do you want? At least it didn't look like a blob of culinary concrete chunks. The hot dog that the the macaroni sat over was excellent. The sausage was good. Earthy, meaty, but not as spiced as one might expect. The bread, the same kind of baguette that was cold and hard the night before, was warm, chewy, and homogenous, hiding a layer of mayo-dressed purple cabbage. So harmonial. The crust was not the hard shell that ruined it for me the night before. It made me understand why the French would bake this bread. The side that came with was poutine. I probably should've gone with the salad. The other choice is plain, old, regular, boring, fries. Comm'on, I'm in Montreal! If I had the choice, I'm going to have poutine! Well, it was a little saltier than the poutine I had the night before. Yes, I had two dinners. Vacation efficiency = food/time. The salmon was by far the best dish. It tasted fresh, flaky, and like salmon. The pesto rice was reportedly good. The side, which is vegetables if I remember right, is how vegetables should be served. No one wants plain steamed vegetables. No one. That is boring, tasteless, and wasteful, because no one enjoys it, and the wonderful flavors have not been released. Julienne it, dressed with some herbs, some vinegar, and I wish I had ordered the salmon instead.  Service was responsive. Our waiter was attentive to the fact that we didn't speak French or understand the dual-tax on the receipt. And winked a lot."}
{"text":"Wow wow rewow ! Des plats à 5$ d'aussi grande qualité ces incroyable ! J'étudie à l'uqam et ces de loin le spot parfait pour qu'un etudiant pauvre puisse manger quelques chose qui a de très bon !   Ils ont une grande terasse pour l'été aussi !"}
{"text":"Si vous souhaitez manger pour pas cher, des plats de bonne qualité, il faut que vous testiez le Cinko! Le deal est que vous ne paierez que 5$ pour la plupart de leurs plats \"de base\", si vous commandez également une boisson! Le seul hic serait la musique tonitruante de la salle principale qui empêche absolument toute conversation....mais je vous rassure, il existe plusieurs salles et terrasses pour compenser! Les plats sont variés et délicats...à l'image du risotto fume à l'érable et peuvent réserver de belles surprises comme le hot -dog Cinko et son accompagnement de macaronis au fromage! Le service est plutôt bon et les serveurs vous conseillent avec brio!"}
{"text":"Nothing like having a waitress hold a front door door closed, not letting you into a restaurant on the coldest day of the year because she doesn't want \"a wind\" entering the dining area. I've had a lot of strange dining experiences but a waitress holding the front door shut on a paying customer? Very odd indeed - and then she has the nerve to give me attitude when I complain!! Great restaurant, TERRIBLE employee to have greeting customers."}
{"text":"Awesome spot recommended by the front desk at the hostel I'm staying at. Every food item on the menue is $5! High quality, ample serving size. I had a the best veggie burger of my life there just a few hours ago. It had eggplant, zucchini, and other great things. Side salad too, all $5."}
{"text":"Tous les plats sont à 5$. Déjà, en soit, ca vaut le détour. Comble de bonheur un taco aufish and chips à 5$, quoi d'autre pourrais-je ajouter?  Excellent service, vraiment."}
{"text":"Attn all tourists: Flock here for reasonable food at reasonable prices.  It's like the $5.00 store for food, and the food is decent.  Walking in the snow like a Whitewalker from the Game of Thrones I came across this place and decided to try it just to get out of the cold weather.  They serve their meals on a coaster that's actually ahold LP record, and they have a good selection of $5.00 items.  Like the American I am, I had a bacon cheeseburger, and a side of their poutine fries.  All were decent and good."}
{"text":"great place! great ambiance especially for college students and the young crowd! edgy vibe and the best part is that every single thing on the menu is $5 minus drinks! if you're on a budget and want to impress a date this is the place! :) I recommend the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"First of all, 5$ a plate??? What? Don't worry it is not a scam and you do get a nicely portioned plate for what you order. The food itself is not top notch but pretty good nonetheless. Order two plates for 10$ for more variety and it's definitely enough to fill you up. Unless you are really hungry and if you are then you are better off going to the sushi buffet a few steps away.  A perfect place to bring your gf/bf on a casual date. Because you also get a pretty large variety of cocktails, beers, or soft drinks if you need to drive after but why would you drive to downtown in the first place? Please use public transport it's greener than the salade that you should have ordered.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars is because their fries taste like mcdonald's which is right across cinko. Coincidence? I'll let you decide."}
{"text":"Really tasty, excellent food for the price of $5 a dish. Poutine was the only I tried in Montreal and was fosho worth the calories.  The restaurant is hip and very well decorated with old records as placemats, and colorful walls, with a few booths in the back that seem like they're for the super cool kids. They were playing cool music the whole time. Only downside was the service - they seemed to take advantage of tourists, tricking us into ordering the most expensive drinks after telling us of a $5 cocktail deal....  The drink was good but not the $5 cocktail I was expecting.   Would come back for the food and ambience but will be wary of the tricky staff."}
{"text":"Very nice.  Very nice indeed.  Everything $5 but with extra toppings a few $ more. On st denis you can get a very decent meal for under 10.00. Fish taco excellent and portions good. Chick peas salad also nice. Service friendly an attentive, just right. Billingual menu and service.    Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Je suis retourné au Cinko! Wow quel différence de la première fois! Nous avons commandé un plat de Tacos, une poutine et le hot-dog avec macaronie au fromage. Le tout délicieux! Le service super rapide. Et ce n'est pas chère.   On aime quand on a une petite ou une grosse  faim et qu'on veut éviter de manger au Mcdo avec les gens louches sur St-Denis, ou qu'on est trop tanné de manger des sandwich au Vua, ou que notre budjet ne nous permet pas d'aller manger aux restos de Sushi à volonté!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and polite. The whole place has a very hip vibe and is very clean especially considering how busy it is! I had a veggie dog with the optional chili. The meal itself was quite filling. The flavor of the chili was unfortunately bland and didn't compliment the toppings of the veggie dog at all and was served overt top the hot dog.  The pint I had was more expensive than similiar establishments and, combined with the underwhelming meal, made me realize I was taking my first and last trip to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Prices are cheap, when we went it was not crazy busy yet the service was still really slow and no one came around to fill up water.  Had Portuguese chicken (see pic) it was pretty much a bite size piece, which I must say was seasoned nicely and had good flavour.  Yam poutine was good.  Shared bread pudding after seeing great reviews but was not impressed it was a doughy cinnamon bun like creation with walnuts. We just had a spoonful each and decided to pass on it since it was not that tasty.  Ok place to go for a cheap meal but nothing great."}
{"text":"Great food. Waitress was really nice and the fish tacos were absolutely amazing. Water was served complimentary and food was relatively cheap. ($25 for two) Great place to eat for lunch with a buddy or alone."}
{"text":"J'étais curieuse d'essayer un resto m'offrant des assiettes à 5,00$ alors j'ai testé.   Dès qu'il fait froid dehors, il fait également froid en dedans. Je n'ose pas imaginer en plein janvier. Le problème c'est l'entrée non fermée alors dès que la porte s'ouvre, on gèle. Côté ambiance et bien c'est chouette, style loud bar avec disque vinyle en guise de napperon, belle idée. La musique est quand même forte ceci dit. Ce qui augmente le volume des conversations et le niveau sonore y est très élevé.  Côté menu, il est plutôt varié de style snack de resto-bar et du végé se trouve dans les choix. J'ai essayé le saumon de l'Atlantique au pesto accompagné de riz: très bon, mais nécessite une 2e assiette puisque le morceau de saumon faisait 6 bouchées. J'ai pris aussi le sandwich végé au tofu grillé avec frites: ordinaire voir médiocre, aucun plaisir en bouche, frites mollasses et tièdes. J'y retournerai probablement pour essayer d'autres plats, à une heure de moindre affluence lorsque moins de bruits et en demandant une table au fond du resto, loin de la porte d'entrée.   Mon verdict: correct sans plus, pour le moment."}
{"text":"J'adore le Cinko! Il y a plein de choix de plats, vraiment pas chers (5$ de base, et on peut rajouter des ingrédients pour 1, 2 ou 3$) L'alcool n'est pas si cher, il y a des verres de vin pour 6-7$ et du cidre pour 4$ le grand verre Il y a toujours du monde et de l'ambiance Souvent, il faut faire le line up (quand on est 2, c'est pas si long mais 3 ou + ça peut etre assez long l'attente... genre 20mn et +...) La musique est assez forte, surtout dans la salle dans laquelle on entre (ça me parait moins fort dans l'autre salle, en haut) Serveurs très sympas et polis Je recommande vivement! Super expérience pour pas cher!"}
{"text":"Pour une 2e visite en 12 mois, je suis surpris d'avoir droit à autant de saveur avec une assiette aussi simple à 5$. Le burger végé et ses frites sont fameux. Comme gâterie, le pouding aux pains au caramel était décadent. Pour jaser, le DJ live nous a donné du fil à retorde, mais ses choix musicaux étaient très bien. Le personnel est adorable."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, I would definitely recommend. The 5$ menu is 5$ for almost everything if you get a drink but they have almost all day happy hour for rum and gin so it's really cheap. Cost me and one other person 33$ to eat and we both got a drink, I got burger and fries and a poutine. He got burger and fries."}
{"text":"I'm a bit on the fence for this one. On one hand, Cinko has a menu of not just incredibly cheap, but also interesting food AND a fantastic atmosphere of trendy music and decor. On the other hand, well, the food quality could be better. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, maybe I shouldn't expect more for something worth 5$ - but I think they can make a huge difference by just using fresher ingredients and being a tad more generous in their portions.  I went there last night with friends, and we each ordered one dish. I declined adding side dishes to my Fish and Chips tacos. The service was fast and pleasant, and soon they brought in nicely presented, colorful plates of food. Although my tacos had a good combination of fried fish and pico de gallo, they were also topped with 3-4 awkward fries (the \"Chips\" part), and lined with an almost non-existent layer of guacamole that was tasteless and brownish from oxidation. The tomatoes were a bit watery and too acidic, but given in great amount to fill in for the fish. The overall taste of good, but it left me neither hungry or full. So I payed my 5.75$ bill, added some tips and left.   I guess I ordered wrong. I think the best way would be to get more than one dish, and to share everything with friends. I'll try that next time!"}
{"text":"Meh.   Just a bunch of cheap food.   Better off elsewhere.   Don't really think it's that popular outside of being cheap."}
{"text":"I knew about this restaurant before but never thought about trying it out, the 5$ price is appealing but I was always a bit sceptical of the portions. Decided to take the plunge on a Friday afternoon after biking all day. Me and my boyfriend were ravenous and everything on the menu looked good. We both got the burger but I opted for a side of mac and cheese and fries, he got the salad and the 7$ option of the burger (which comes with a pickle).   The food was delicious, a really good burger and an even better mac and cheese. I wish the portion was bigger and that you could order it as a meal instead of a side. (You need to order a meal to be able to order a side of something).   The restaurant is nice and busy. It has its unique quality to it. The place mats are old vinyl's. But there were some low points: I didn't like the music they were playing and the service was horribly slow. I mean we waited 30 minutes before our order was taken and the waitress forgot our order so she had to come back which meant our food hadn't even started to be prepared. But the girl was new and I understand the difficulties of any new job so I didn't hold that against her or the rating of the overall restaurant experience.   The portions are adequate. Since I added the macaroni, it was honestly a bit too much. I'm a light eater, I eat little portions but a lot of them. But some people need to eat a lot and not as often, so I would recommend ordering more food if you are one of those people. Since everything is cheap, it's not really a stretch to order more. The burger didn't fill up my boyfriend at all.  I would go back, it was good food, good price, overall great experience."}
{"text":"Un resto où tout est à 5$ (avant taxes), qui propose un menu varié, comment ne pas aimer? J'ai été surprise par la variété et la créativité du menu. Les portions sont petites,  ce qui est normal pour le prix, donc prévoir un peu plus si vous avez un gros appétit. La déco est \"funky\".  Seul point négatif, j'y suis allée à la 2e semaine de la rentrée, et ils n'étaient pas du tout prêts pour le retour des étudiants. Le service était désorganisé, on a pris notre commande 15 minutes après notre arrivée alors que toutes les tables autour (arrivées après nous) avaient déjà commander. La cuisine ne fournissait pas les plats sortaient au compte goûte.  Bref, on y retourne mais pas avant un mois ou deux, question qu'ils s'adaptent à l'augmentation de la clientèle."}
{"text":"Le service m'a toujours été très agréable et les plats jamais décevants (surtout pas le hot dog végé!)  Nous sommes allés une fois et le serveur a malencontreusement renversé quelque chose par terre et a salit une personne qui était avec nous. En revanche ils se sont excusés mille fois (littéralement) en offrant le repas à ladite personne plus un dessert gratuit.   C'est bon, par chers et accessible facilement. La terrasse l'été est superbe mais l'intérieur a tendance à être plutôt bruyant avec la musique forte et le brouhaha.   J'y retourne souvent pour leur limonade au bourbon aussi, un must!"}
{"text":"Pourquoi appeler ça Cinko si tu ne peu plus commander un repas à 5$? Il t'obligent a acheter une bouteille d'eau et ça fais donc 7$. Dommage. J'aimais bien les repas rapide pas chers d'avant. Ça va si tu prend de l'alcool mais sinon oublie ça. En même temps, on dirais une stratégie pour éviter la clientèle qui vient à petit budget."}
{"text":"After passing by this spot many times but never coming in, my boyfriend and I finally decided to try it. The skeptic (and food snob) in me was super hesitant, but I've finally caved. They don't take reservations, but when you get there, you'll see that there's always a line up.  Good: The portions were very decent considering it was only $5. We've ordered the beet salad, fish tacos and naan bread pizza to share. I don't drink and my boyfriend took his car too, so we ended up ordering a bottle of water and tea (note: They have DavidsTea). The bill total came to $20.25 before tax for 2 people...very inexpensive. The food wasn't oustanding by any means, but I was surprised at how good it was for $5 a plate.   Bad: It's a lot younger and rowdier crowd, which is different than the spots I've frequently visit. The entry door also has 18+ stickers all over, which resmembles a sketchy sex shop. It left a weird impression at first, but I left with a pleasant experience.  Bottom line: It's $5 food, it's not going to be amazing, but at least it's pretty good! Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"We had tacos and a burger - both solid for the price.  Quebec has adopted a law that requires all beef burgers to be cooked well done so don't bother begging for a juicy medium. I know...I tried."}
{"text":"The sweet potato poutine here was unreal, definitely worth a stop into Cinko! My girlfriend also ordered the white sangria which she loved, but otherwise the other things we ordered were just ok (burger and Portuguese chicken).   The ambiance here is unique. We went on Friday night (maybe our fault) and there was a DJ playing music at club volume. Made it a bit tough to hear the person across the table without shouting. If you are on a budget or not too hungry this is a cool spot because you can get most dishes for just $5 (or $7 or $9 if you opt for the upcharge options)."}
{"text":"Tapas styled dishes at a good price. The vibe is modern and the food creative and tasty.  The sweet potato Poutine is good, so was the Portuguese chicken and deep fried Ferrero Rochers. It's got a terrasse alongside the resto in the summer. However, in the colder months it's limited to indoors and there are lineups for the supper rush because the menu deal that gets people in from 2-5:30pm are the incredibly cheap drinks.  So getting there early might still mean lining up.  The staff are great and they had their own DJ on his MacBook mixing some beats at the bar. At $5, you can afford to try a lot of things and they let you split items on the menu so go ahead and get a taste of everything!"}
{"text":"Waited too long to get in. The food was okay, but the plating makes it look like it costs more than 5$  The haricot poutine is my favourite of all(peas poutine in english?)  this is definitively the place to go if you are on a budget but still want to eat somethig fancy"}
{"text":"Personnellement je suis abonnée a ce restaurant! J'y suis aller plusieurs fois et il y a des jours où le service étais exceptionnel et un jour ils ont pris 35 minutes a me servir un simple hamburger/frite. ( la cause: il avais un problème avec l'imprimante de la cuisine). Pour conclure si vous voulez seulement un plat pour accompagner votre verre, Cinko est la place!"}
{"text":"Food is really good for the price ( favorite dish would be the haricot poutine). Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relax and great! I would recommend!"}
{"text":"We got fish tacos and surf & turf burger. You get what you pay for: soggy fries, burnt burgers and tasteless salad. No ketchup bottles either - they will bring you little packets. They also blast music very loud. Go here if you are cheap, like we were trying to be."}
{"text":"Peu de choix de bières, très bruyant, mais la bouffe est très bonne."}
{"text":"Une place vraiment sympathique et des plats pas cher bons et bien présentés que demander de plus ? Ah oui que l'alcool soit un peu moins cher"}
{"text":"Le Cinko fait partie de la famille des restaurant qui vendent tous leurs plats à 5$. Ou 7$ ou 9$ si vous avez une faim de loup et que vous voulez rajouter du bacon par çi ou du guacamole par là. Nous arrivons avec 2 amies a 19h50... Il y a 3 personnes devant nous. Le temps passe et la plupart des gens qui arrivent après nous (peut importe le nombre) passent avant nous... 1h plus tard, (oui oui 1h!) enfin une table nous est attribuée! Nous commandons de la bière et j'opte pour un burger classique. Tout est dit! Classique ni plus ni moins, les frites sont bonnes mais je reste sur ma faim!  Alors je craque!!! Un dessert pour le moins atypique! Les Ferrero Rocher frits! Un délice! Mais si vous faites attention à votre ligne oubliez ça!! Rien à redire sur le service pas mal efficace de notre sympathique serveur!  Je ne suis pas sûre de vouloir y retourner. Je préfère, et de loin, l'Entrepôt sur Mont Royal!"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert le Cinko seulement mardi soir après une séance ciné. J'ai tout de suite aimé l'ambiance. La carte est attractive, le service efficace et rapide. J'ai opté pour le burger végétarien supplément fromage de chèvre, très bon.  Comme tous les plats sont à 5$ la facture n'est pas très élevée, idéal pour les petits budgets :)"}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap, but it is easy to go over the $5s that everyone raves about. Our bill for 2 people was $25, which included one beer. The photos make this look like a place that a family could go to, but in the evening there was a live DJ and it was very loud."}
{"text":"1ère fois : service super lent +1h pour avoir son plat. Le couple à côté à commandé en même temps que nous et a finit son plat alors qu'on avait pas encore reçu les notre. Je ne conseille pas de prendre les salade pour 5$ sauf pour les petites faim. Très déçue des salade.  2ème fois : pain ciabatta tofu : service encore une fois très long, le plat un peu meilleur.  NE SURTOUT PAS Y ALLER EN HEURE DE POINTE"}
{"text":"Try to find a cheap but good place to eat on the Plateau, and good luck!  Well, here is one, all dishes including desserts are only $5.00!!  Mind you, the emphasis seems to be heavy on the junk...poutine & more poutine, the godfather hot dog, (mac & cheese on top of a giant hot dog) and different burgers. Take heart ,and if you are worried about your heart, fear not, there are veggie and some lighter fare options. I had the veggies wrap, which was very good, lots of FRESH crisp veggies wrapped inside a green tortilla, with a chocolate mousse with raspberry coulis for dessert... yummy indeed! My friend had the curried chicken dish ,followed by the same dessert as I had, and she proclaimed that it was better than what she'd had at Juliette & Chocolate,and for a far better price, oh my! Great little place with a retro-oddball decor (old desk lamps with extension necks, all cobbled together as chandeliers, old 78's as place mats,graffiti walls) but it all works. Service prompt, courteous and informative."}
{"text":"Giving an extra star for cool atmosphere, but the food was not fresh. I had chicken tacos and fries. Nothing on the plate was hot in the last hour or so. Very room temperature."}
{"text":"A small restaurant where all the courses are only $5!!!  The good: Nice decor and ambiance. Food is good. The burger is very juicy, not dry, filling, and the most popular choice of this restaurant. A lot of vegetarian plates available. Bathroom design is pretty awesome.  The bad: At that price, portions are small (but burger is fine). Everything extra, costs extra, and that is where the price stacks up. You can wait a long time before getting a seat, so be patient.   Terrific food, but small portions, so you might not be satisfied after your meal."}
{"text":"I came here twice, both times late at night after a very long day of running around. Both times, we ordered a glass of their classic mojito and for some reason, it felt like the best one we've ever had (maybe we were just tired??): lots of lime, lots of mint, and not too sweet.   Food wise, it is nothing special but for $5, I'm not complaining. The bun on the mac and cheese hot dog came soggy, their sausage lacked flavour and the mac and cheese tasted very ordinary. However, we had a great experience with their bread pudding: its super rich and goey packed with caramel, a must get!"}
{"text":"Common means 5 in Spanish and everything on the menu is $5 only! Service is very good in an intimate candlelit basement. I have absolutely no idea how they make money. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good service, got seated very quickly. Catered  to our non french speaking skills which was good. Food came quickly, wish it was more flavored with salt and pepper but we were able to add our own seasoning to our dishes which were good. I got the cinko hot dog which was very good, also got the poutine which was very good and filling for the entire table. Also my sister got the risotto with mushroom and grilled chicken and the Portuguese chicken with veggies and fries was also ordered. Everything was over all good. I like the idea everyone has to but drinks and then all your meals are only $5.55!! Thats pretty awesome!! Great music as well which was such a plus. This was our first spot after arriving to montreal and it was a good choice!"}
{"text":"Great find thanks to other yelpers made me decide on this place, came here Saturday evening and was busy they did have seats inside patio was full. The menu had a lot to choose from you needed to order alcohol to make your meal be $5 which is not bad I had a raspberry fizz the alcohol tasted like water to me. It's better suited for groups it's very loud here. The inside decorate was nice. The servers here were fast and good although very busy they managed well I had the veggie burger with sweet fries poutine, the poutine was delicious but the portion was so small like baby sized. Overall I'd recommend and would return. Given that on this street there is many food places to choose from"}
{"text":"3 Étoiles et demi! Meilleur que L'Entrepôt.  Concept similaire. Choix semblables, mais mieux exécuter."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est vraiment bien. Les serveurs et portier sont sympathique. Le restaurant est très propre. C'est plus un bar / bristro qu'un restaurant.   Le prix est très abordable 5,55$ le plat + un consommation entre 2 et 9.  Cependant la bouffe est un bonne mais sans wow. On doit prendre des extra pour avoir quelque chose dé wow."}
{"text":"Eh, the food is cheap and interesting enough. Mostly from freezer to fryer. Almost everything on the menu can be upgraded for a small fee. The add-on/side options are pretty good.  Drinks are cheap by the pitcher so all in all a good place to go with friends for a cheap binge."}
{"text":"Cinko is a groovy little spot on Saint Denis where, to me, it gives off an effortlessly cool air. The overall ambience of dim lights, the loud blast of quality music covering a span of genres and time periods through the speakers, and accentuation by the means of old vinyl records as place mats and pictures of legendary musicians make this place ideal for young Montrealers. In addition, the food is actually and obviously cheap and affordable enough for broke university students to enjoy, so Montréal Blog might want to take note when advising that age group on where they should go to eat instead of listing what Yelp would put in the $$-$$$ range.  The food, while nothing particularly mind-boggling (except for a very delicious bread pudding), gives customers an incredible bang for their buck, especially the burger meals. I got the classic burger with fries, and it was nicely-sized and filled me up in a satisfying way. It went along quite well with the mojito (the $5 rule doesn't apply to alcoholic drinks by the way), which, although on the weaker side, was still delicious and presented in a cute jar.  Finally, to top off the experience, I decided to try the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, and I was not disappointed. It has the perfect balance of piping hot and ice cold creamy goodness that all come together for a heavenly experience in your mouth, with just a bit of added crunch from the walnuts to top it all off. If you have extra room in your stomach for dessert, then I highly recommend you try this dish.  Overall, a rad place with good vibes and good food that just might make you feel cooler than you actually are. Stay classy Cinko."}
{"text":"I've been to Cinko twice and what always stands out is the welcoming service from the manager and the bar staff (i sat at the bar both times). Food is good and pretty varied and it's hard to believe that everything is $5. Cool concept."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with Cinko. Everything is $5 and about the half the things we got were worth it. The sweet potato poutine was decent but the fries were pretty soggy. All of their sandwiches and burgers are pre made and you can taste it. We got a pitcher of mojitos as well and while it was tasty it was pretty light on the alcohol."}
{"text":"Mieux vaut être patient quand on va au cinko ou y aller de bonne heure car sinon il faudra patienter un moment avant que l'ont vous installe à une table.  Les plats sont à 5$ seulement et son bons. J'ai adoré la poutine à la patate douce et le dessert Ferrero Rocher frit.   Les serveurs sont sympas.  Je recommande cette place"}
{"text":"A part la musique qui est très bonne là-bas ainsi que l'ambiance, la nourriture par contre n'est pas exquise. Alors là vraiment pas. Pour ne pas dire pas bonne. Poutine froide, griot de porc sec (très très sec), le tacos de griot idem. Oh la la! J'avais le désir profond de découvrir cette place et de tomber en amour avec mais, côté nourriture, c'est un vrai flop!"}
{"text":"Its insanely affordable (less than $10 for a very fulfilling meal)    There is also refillable soft drinks."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The Caribbean tacos and the cinko fries were delicious. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Cinko is now one of my favourite spots in Montreal! Everything is well worth the price. The drinks are amazing too. I ordered a double and could barely taste the alcohol which surprised me, so the pours may not be as long. However, the service was good. When I asked for a recommendation, my waitress gave many options, one of which was what I ordered."}
{"text":"Un peu déçue par le cinko. Certes le concept de plats à 5 pièces est sympa, la musique et le cadre aussi mais j'ai pas été très fan du poulet portugais et du Burger surf& turf. Dans le même genre, le gros lux est nettement meilleur."}
{"text":"Parfait pour étudiants! Tout prêt de l'UQAM et des repas à 5$! Bonne musique, ambiance jeune et branchée et la terrasse l'été des parfaite. Restaurent toujours rempli! Pour les ventres creux cependant, les petits extras peuvent s'accumuler facilement et la facture grimpe rapidement avec l'alcool."}
{"text":"Sweet potatoe fries with bacon was good.  Fries and bacon were crispy and was good combination of sweet and salty.  I also got the burger and it was disappointing.  It was very dry and had to drink 3 glasses of water.  Prices for all items were very affordable most at $5 per item. The loud music made it hard to chat with other friends.  Probably won't visit this place again unless I am interested in some cheap late night eats."}
{"text":"This restaurant holds a bar license so you need to show your 18+ ID to eat there, even if you don't order alcohol.   All the menu items are 5$, a great bargain. The portions are surprisingly big for the price, and one entree + one main should fill up a medium appetite, unlike tapas places in which you are expected to have multiple small dishes to yourself.   They have a seasonally changing menu. The items I've sampled are the watermelon salad (fresh and light, could use more watermelon), the sweet potato fries (standard), the Portuguese chicken (good), and their poutine.  The dishes are simple, but the value at this price-point is nearly unbeatable. There is indoor seating and a nice table for a larger group of people, and in the summer there is seating on the side of the restaurant, close to the library.  5$ includes even the tax!"}
{"text":"In this area you will find tons of restaurants. In passing this restaurant has always seemed to have a big crowd with blasting music so I decided to stop by. It was around 6pm and there was a wait of about 4-5 people in front of me. Before she took my name I asked if there was seating at the bar, which there was so I proceeded inside. The restaurant was a nice size with a stairway towards the back area leading to more seats. The bartenders seemed to be very busy but were cheerful and seemed to work well together. To drink I ordered a drink called Kho Phi Phi. It was rum-based with several liqueurs and some juices. The drink was made so quickly I didn't get a chance to see but it looked yummy. My first sip I felt a sugar rush through my back teeth, very tart and tangy but pretty good (if you like fruity drinks). The color definitely reminds you of an ocean. I looked at the menu and didn't see anything I really had a taste for but majority of the items are $5 or a little above. They consisted of basic things like nachos, burgers, quesadillas, etc. I ordered an appetizer mexican tortilla soup. Unlike my drink,  it took about 20-25 minutes before it came out. It was served hot with triangle-shaped bread. The soup and bread were both surprisingly good. Service was pretty good and I noted no major concerns. If you're in the area and need a quick bite, check them out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the cinko for a while now, and my wallet too. It's such a cool concept. I went for diner before a show and really enjoyed the ambiance. There was a dj even if it was only 17h30. A cool decor with tags and design prints. Even vinyle on the tables as doily.  5$ is in fact 5,55$ only when you order a drink, but still, it's hella cheap! Two person with 2 drinks and sparkling water we ended up with only a 30$ bill!  I took the hot dog cinko with fries and mac n cheese. There was not alot of condiment but everything was tasty and extremely filling. My boyfriend took the classic burger and it's the perfect name. Just a classic good burger with crispy fries.  I had a good time. Quick and easy. Great!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar thinking it would be quick and simple service. Bartender was checked-out service wise. No effort to produce a passable service or even speak to me in the language of my choice. PAS FORT PHIL.  I ordered the grilled cheese, which I had had here before. I was surprised when the bartender asked if I would like fries or salad as I didn't recall the grilled cheese coming with a side last time. When the waitress came with a plate, she offered to set a hamburger down in front of me. I said \"no\" and communicated that that wasn't my order. The waitress looked at the bartender and confirmed that the burger was for 102, the bartender looked at me and said I was 102 and that this was my meal. I reiterated my \"no\" at which point the meal was placed in front of me and both staff members walked away. So let me get this right, TWO staff members can be told that this isn't what I ordered, both will ignore me and not bother to even ask what I had actually ordered to correct the situation? You're literally going to ignore me? At that point I just wanted my bill and to GFTO. (Also, HOW did you get \"hamburger\" from \"grilled cheese\"? They're even the same words used in both languages!!)  I poked at some fries seeing as it was pointless to try and get this fixed with their staff who clearly didn't care. I asked the busboy for the dish to be wrapped up to go as I was in no mood for a burger. Ended up having a bite of it at home. Ketchup covered salad greens and a flavorless overcooked burger patty. Yum...? $5 menu... you get what you pay for, and the service is s***."}
{"text":"Nice place to go out with friends, prices are not high, I'll recommend the chicken quesadillas and the hotdog cinko with macaroni."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. We in Montreal for the weekend and were looking for local places to eat. We decided on this restaurant cause the prices seem really affordable. Once we walked in they has a 15 min wait which was not bad at all. Once we were seated the waiter was really friendly and explained everything to us. I order the surf and turf burger and nachos my sister got the salmon salad and my friend got the classic burger with sweet potatoes fry and it was all really good then the check came and we were shock to see how affordable this place was. When i come back to Montreal this will be a place that i will come to again hey i might even go for lunch today"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  The food is absolutely delicious and it's so fun for only $5 a meal, you can get two things and keep your taste buds happy and be full! The portions are decent and the taste is great. I love the variety, some may say it's not much variety, but each dish is so different, you have to be able to find something.   Enjoyed a great meal of Portuguese chicken and Fish Tacos with a glass of champagne :)    Vegetarian friendly*  Fun environment for younger crowd and fun, up to date, music."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it opened and I love the environment. Plus, everything on the menu is only 5$ except drinks. Note that, some portions are quite small so you may need to order at least 2 plates if you're really hungry. I usually get a sweet potato poutine and classic burger. Great customer service from the staff, Definitely worth a try !"}
{"text":"Cinko, comme son nom l'indique, tout est à 5$ (ou presque). La terrasse sur le côté est calme et conviviale, le service est rapide. Dans une même assiette vous aurez de la nourriture en quantité et une variété de mets étonnante! Un mélange de saveurs et de couleurs, pour profiter du soleil toute l'année d'une façon originale et peu coûteuse ! Le pichet mojito est super pratique bien qu'un peu cher, mais quand même très bon :) Belle découverte, j'y retournerai c'est certain!"}
{"text":"This place needs to exist in every city in the world. $5 Canadian for everything, which in US dollars is like free. Add on a bit more depending on what you want (ie fries make the meals $6, add something else makes it $7 etc) but we filled up for real cheap. Quality food. Sandwiches are pre made so they said they can't take special requests but your standards shouldn't be that high as a human being anyway."}
{"text":"Le principe est super. 5$ pour les plats qui sont des portions très raisonnables et de bonne qualité pour le prix. Par contre...si vous y allez le soir, soit vous arrivez tôt ou préparez vous à faire la file et d'être patient pour vos plats. J'y ai été 3-4 fois et la dernière était une mauvaise expérience. Il était environ 16h (donc pas grand monde) la serveuse nous a assis sans les menus, personne n'est venu nous donner de verres d'eau...les gens passaient à côté de nous comme si nous étions invisible alors qu'on cherchait clairement à vouloir demander nos plats. 20 minutes plus tard (notre patience a ses limites) nous avons quitté. C'était ma dernière fois au Cinko. Il y a des meilleurs restaurants juste à côté si vous voulez mon avis."}
{"text":"This place was about what you can expect for a place where all food items are $5. The food was really pretty average and nothing to write home about but the bar tender and service were overall really great!"}
{"text":"Chosen for cheapness, relative to other restaurants on the street, and a vegetarian-friendly menu. It's on a super fun street of restaurants with outdoor eating areas, if you haven't been here.   The food was all good, we ended up up with more than we could eat, and the beer servings seemed very generous.   There is a line, but it wasn't too bad. We were seated at a long table that had another couple at the other end, and all had plenty of room for outdoor dining. It drizzled a bit at one point but the umbrellas were enough to keep the rain out.   The poutine was the only one I had while in Montreal, and I thought it was very good!"}
{"text":"This will be my second time going to Cinko and I was a lot smarter with my order than last time. The first time I went, I ordered a delicious salad and some seafood plate. Although it was tasty af, I left the resto still hungry.   However, this time around I ordered their classic burger that comes with fries and the beer salad (I ordered this last time as well... it's just so yummy)  So... The burger: the patty was over cooked but I ain't even mad because at $5, who's expecting high quality? They made up for it by putting bacon in it. The aioli was the best part. If you order this, ask for extra aioli on the side... then dip everything in it!  The fries: standard, tasty fries but so big of a portion that you can bring leftovers home for doggy treats.   Beet salad: it's so exciting to have a fun variety of ingredients in a restaurant salad and this one was only 5 dollars! I'm remembering the last time I went someplace on crescent (my mistake) for happy hour and I ordered a salad. $15 for lettuce, 3 pieces of tomatoes, and I think a couple of wedges of cucumbers. Luckily, I was already a few glasses of wine in and couldn't motivate myself to complain.   All that being said, I will definitely be going here more often.   P.S. it gets super busy at peak hours. Get ready to wait!"}
{"text":"Matt our server was great. Good and cheap food and don't forget the alcohol. Loud and crowded good place to hang and chill but wouldn't recommend for a romantic date though. Overall a must to go and try"}
{"text":"Just fantastic. How can food be this good for so cheap?! Great service too. We had the CINKO hot dog (it has Mac n cheese my lord), surf n turf burger, and the deep fried ferrero rochers.   Great place for travellers who don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"J'ai rétiré une étoile pour le service! Mais je vais donner une deuxième chace! La bouffe est bonne et n'est pas cher!"}
{"text":"Très petits prix pour quand même pas mal de nourriture ! Satisfaite de ma soirée, le décor et l'ambiance est vraiment cool. Service pas si pire mais les employés font un tout petit trop d'attitude pour moi :/"}
{"text":"Great price, most of the items are 5.00$. The portions are quite small and so it would be a good idea to order a few items if you tend to get hungry easily. Would have tried the sweet potato fries, had I found out about it earlier."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, brilliant Alexander Keith's blonde beer- this is a must try! Poutine was great, Caribbean tacos can be skipped. :)"}
{"text":"What got my attention about Cinko was that their dishes are $5. I've ordered the pan-seared fresh Atlantic salmon and beignets with mint chocolate sauce and sangria. But the sangria is not part of the $5 deal but I can't say no to a drink. I love the service, the food, and the ambiance of the place. I can come back to Cinko when I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"I dropped by Cinko last night with my husband and a friend of ours. The restaurant was jampacked and on the noisy side, with music playing so loud it was difficult to hold a meaningful conversation; definitely more a bar atmosphere than a restaurant.  The food at Cinko is cheap; as the name hints it, all the food items on the menu are $5 each. Furthermore, it's possible add extras (cheese or jalapeño for example) to your plate for $1 to $2 more a piece. May it be noted that there are several vegetarian options on the menu, so that's definitely a plus for veg people out there.  The food itself was very decent; not the most amazing food I've ever tasted but certainly good, especially for the price.   On the noteworthy side, Cinko uses vintage records place mats, quite a unique use of these artifacts! The decor was original too; lots of black and white seemingly hand-drawn patterns and art on the walls, a design which can also be found on the bathroom sinks and even on the toilets themselves!  The main part of the Cinko experience I find regrettable is the loud music and the lack of space. Perhaps the formula of cramming as many people as possible in a locale and cranking up the volume works well in some bars to get the alcohol flowing, but it's not so nice when you are hoping to eat a meal and catch your breath.  I don't know if I will ever be back. I wish good fortune to the owners nonetheless. They have an interesting business in their hands and good waiters."}
{"text":"Un très bon rapport qualité-prix avec un service sympathique. Une cuisine surprenament goûteuse et des portions très honnêtes. La présentation du menu est originale. Une adresse à garder et recommander."}
{"text":"Good hip hop music, Biggie on the walls, and quality food that's cheaper than a McDonald's ! We had sweet potato poutine, surf and turf burger, fish tacos, and grilled chicken breast with two side salads all for less than 25 dollars! Each meal can come out to either $5, $7, or $9 depending on the size of the portion and additional toppings. The place was a great spot to enjoy good music and cheap bites."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. I noticed they change their menu. To have a 5$ meal, you need to purchase a beverage. The beer is a great choice. My husband and I both like the surf and turf burger the most, with fries. This time I found the salad is not very fresh."}
{"text":"De très bons plats et une ambiance unique. Une adresse à garder en tête pour aller boire des verres avec des amis ou tout simplement pour y manger !"}
{"text":"Je suis fan carrément de ce restaurant. Première fois, malgré que je vis dans le quartier, je passe régulièrement devant. Je trouvais la devanture moche, la terrasse sur st-denis trop sombre, style bar miteux. Et bien laissez moi vous dire que je me suis trompée. Je me suis installée sur la terrasse donnant sur la ruelle (là ou il y a le McDo). A l'intérieur une deco rétro, du vinyl, de la couleur, du zébré. On est sous le charme. Notre serveuse, une jeune demoiselle pleine de vie et de bonne humeur, nous incite à prendre le pichet de mojito pour nous ouvrir l'appétit. On ne regrette pas, c'est frais, pas trop sucré, bien alcoolisé et avec ce bon gout de menthe. Puis on se prend 3 plats pour partager. La poutine aux patates douces, le burger végétarien et le général tao avec 4 morceaux de poulet. NON MAIS WOW!!!! Ok sérieux pour 5$ je n'ai jamais mangé quoi que ce soit d'aussi savoureux. J'ai été très surprise par le general tao, je me suis dit que dans un resto qui offre autant de variétés ils allaient se planter. Et bien c'est moi qui me suis plantée. Savoureux, sucré et bien assaisonné. La poutine un vrai régale et que dire du burger végé, je n'en  ai jamais mangé d'aussi bon avec son augergine frite, le zucchini et la sauce tzatziki!!!! Je me suis même gardé une petite bouchée pour finir en beauté!!! Je recommande on y va et on y retourne allégrement!!!"}
{"text":"The sausage with macaroni was delicious.   The flavors were perfect with the cabbage.   I enjoyed the poutine and will have to come back to try more.   The atmosphere was fantastic and an awesome place to be"}
{"text":"I didn't expect the food to be amazing but I expected the service to be decent since we went in the afternoon and the restaurant wasn't packed. We got seated and our drink order taken and delivered pretty quickly and were told by our waitress that she'd be back for the food order. We waited 30 minutes while sipping on our watery Caesar's before getting too antsy. After 45 minutes and still no one stopping by our table, we tired to flag down a waitress. Got one a few minutes later who told us quickly and with very little concern that our waitress would be right with us. It was an hour and twenty minutes by the time she showed up, our drinks had been done for about 45 minutes at that point with no attempt to refill those either, so we decided to just get the bill and go. I understand a restaurant being busy but it wasn't currently busy and this was a little extreme, especially when we paid $12 for mediocre drinks and didn't end up eating at all. The Warehouse does a cheap menu much better so I would highly recommend heading there if you want to have a cheap meal and great service!"}
{"text":"This place was a great little find on Rue St Denis.....we were looking for a light dinner and the concept of $5 items was intriguing so we got a table on the terasse. My girlfriend and I wanted to try a few of the dishes so we shared the Gazpacho to start, then split an order of Fish Tacos followed by the Poutine Haricot Vert which is a nice spin on poutine using tempura green beans in place of french fries. We finished off the meal by sharing the bread pudding. It was all washed down with a pitcher of sangria which costs more than the whole meal but was worth it. It made for one of the tastiest and interesting meals of our weekend."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times. I was very reluctant to go at first, paying 5$ for anything in the menu seems awfully too good of a deal. First think you would wonder is how is the quality of that food or wha are they going to feed me? I decided to go and find out for myself. The first time I went I ordered the vegetarian burger, I was pleasantly surprise. The burger was delicious and it came with a side of fries. I would recommend you to try it.  Second time, I went with a friend, there was a little wait before we got seated. I am surprised there is not a line around the block especially during dinner time. We ordered a pitcher of beer, alcohol is a bit pricy than your regular restaurant but you have to give it to them. It is a business and they gonna have to make some money after all. We ordered the surf and turf and naan appetizer. The naan was good, it came with two sauces, Spanish lemon sauce and a sour tomato sauce. The Spanish was pretty good, tomato was too bland for my taste. The surf and turf burger came with fries. It was pretty good.  The ambiance is nice, the DJ was playing late 90s early 2000s music. I bounced on my chair while having dinner, couldn't help it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money !   My first Canadian restaurant experience was a  D U D !   Everything started good , the waiter was cute and nice at first. He barely spoke English. No problem I have google translate. So after trying to figure out the menu  ( because everything is in French) I decided to share food with my mom. She ordered chicken tacos with guac and salsa. My brother got the poutine and a burger. I also ordered a side of bacon that I never got sadly. We also got virgin lemonades that guess this cost us $12.00 EACH with a rotten slice of lemon in glass a regular plain frozen lemonade 12 freaking dollars ! Absolutely not worth it at all. But whatever , we waited about 35 mins for our food. It came to us COLD and FLAVORLESS like WTF . We wait all that time and the food isn't even hot. I was so disappointed. Than we had to move inside because it started to pour down raining. So now that makes the food soggy, flavorless, and even more cold.  Will not return to Cinko. And trust me there is nothing cajun or american about this place. I will say they have the best bathroom in any establishment I've been in all year. The inside is very very nice and instagram worthy. Too bad the food can't match that."}
{"text":"Tried this spot with a friend as we were curious about what we would get from a restaurant that boats 5$ everything. We waited a while in line as they don't take reservations but wasn't too bad. Our server was a little bit slow to come take our order or check on us for more water BUT that being said for 5$ the food was decent. I had the fish tacos and a cocktail. The tacos didn't blow me away but for 5$ they did the trick and the portion size was pretty good. All in all it was a good experience"}
{"text":"This place has it figured out! As the name implies, each dish runs for $5, with options to upgrade to larger, more spectacular meals. They keep the portions small to make this possible, and by piling on their tasty matchstick fries.  That said, I mostly return so often because you can get good, but not excellent, food for cheap. Their sausage and mac & cheese is great, but slightly underseasoned and very tricky to eat. You might have the best luck ordering a few different things to share. They have tons of options, and they're very vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"$5 (CA) for nearly everything?!? (NOTE: This does not include drinks) I had to check this out.  The atmosphere is fun and hip. Since I was solo I sat at the bar. Do this. The bartenders are fast, friendly and great people. (The servers with tables seemed over-worked. Poor things!)  I had a burger and upgraded to sweet potato poutine. Do this. It's worth it. Since everything was such a bargain - I treated myself to the bread pudding. WOWsers! It was tummy-stuffing good. I almost licked the plate.  Check it out. The low prices are not indicative of low quality. You'll get a great meal and enjoy some fun people watching."}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't like was that it was loud and the TV was very sport-focused (at least when I was there). The seating is also pretty tight, you might seat next to people you don't know, close enough for it to be awkward or people's loud conversations interrupting yours. If you don't mind the loudness, it's a good place to eat! Good price for the portions you get. A lot of options to choose from!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Cinko it was closer to when it had just opened and I had a great experience. We sat outside and we shared a few dishes such as the sweet potato poutine and the tempura poutine which were all very good especially for $5 a dish!!   This time we sat inside and the AC was blasting so we were freezing. The service was very slow. We got our bloody Cesaers only after we finished our meal! I had the fish tacos with fries. I was disappointed that the fries were inside the taco rather than as a side. The taco was a bit dry and I had mayo to it which made it better. For five dollars the food is worth it and the portions are good  but they need to improve  service."}
{"text":"Nice watering hole. I had a margarita & the Portuguese chicken that comes with a salad. It was good & not that expensive"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my friends for the first time.  Very good environment with TV's and music. Styled place for a late night restaurant.   Their foods are very tasty, specially the salad. I ordered salad & Poulet Portugaise. The portion is too small (but only 5$ each plat). You have to order 2~3 orders with a drink for a personal if you are really hungry.   So the bill can easily go up over 20$ if you add some extra stuffs. I have to say the real price is $$  I suggest this place for after bar since they open until 4 AM if you are looking for snacks.  Also they don't have takeout. Better order one at time to make sure no waste."}
{"text":"If you are on a budget and want to munch away go to Cinko .   I went a Friday after a long shopping day with my Girl . We wanted to eat good food but having spent most of our funds we needed a wallet friendly joint .   The food is served in different sizes and come as side orders . Comfort type foods , Fried food and also seafood available ( fried shrips hmm)    Service was fast even if it was Pack but Come early as this place fills quickly .  There is Good Ambiance with rock background music   Young and colorfull decor as well ."}
{"text":"Difficile de trouver un meilleur rapport qualité/prix !  Ce n'est pas de la grande cuisine, mais ça se laisse manger, c'est plutôt copieux et bien présenté."}
{"text":"First off: 5,55$ a plate. This is a place to please your wallet! Of course you'll find tastier restaurants on St-Denis, but for 5 bucks, this is a pretty good place. Nice staff, nice interior, nice terrace.  My friends got the grilled tofu ciabatta with hummus and guacamole, and the Cinko veggie hot-dog, both served with either (delicious) fries or salad. On the contrary, I tried a new item on the menu: the fried chicken tenders. I found myself with 5-6 tiny and sad fried chicken tenders, no side dish. The blue cheese sauce couldn't save the plate. I ended up finishing my friends' fries. I guess (hope) this item won't stay on the menu for long.  I'll keep this address on my mind when I'm in the neighbourhood nevertheless!"}
{"text":"I must say I'm not a fan of crowded restaurants with loud music, however, this place is packed with university students. The service is okay, nothing to complain about or to compliment. The food is probably the best thing about this place, I really liked my tacos and the burger was good. The price is another great thing about this place, if you're on a budget and not a big drinker, then you should like their $5 dollar menu. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I probably won't go there on Friday night again due to the long waiting lines."}
{"text":"Pros: cheap, yet high quality and tasty dishes. Most are $5 but with an option of making it $7 or $9. The sweet potato poutine, surf & turf were very delicious and I highly recommend them. The sangrias were also something I would recommend.  Mediocre: The fish & chips/tacos and the hot dog were good but not extraordinary  Cons: the sheer crowds, long lines; the busier the more prone to mistakes"}
{"text":"Great concept: all dishes at $5 ! There is a nice variety of options, dishes are tasty and not as small as expected. Two dishes per person was enough for us. Note: the Portuguese chicken was delicious !  Only downsides: we had to wait to get a table on a Wednesday night (for 15 mins so, not too bad); and my friend's soda was watered down quite a bit."}
{"text":"My first time trying poutine and it was okay. My wife got the salmon and she said it was yummy. The atmosphere was really nice and they played American old school hip hop and rap, which was nice. It's a cool place to get a casual lunch or dinner with friends or a date."}
{"text":"Good restaurant option if you're on a budget, but not the best place to go to if you're really hungry cause you'll be waiting a while before sitting down. The burger was surprisingly very good. The rest was pretty average."}
{"text":"Cheap, close to metro, relaxed environment and the food was decent. The poutine could be better and the burgers too. No onion, tomato, or pickles on the burger, I thought of it as strange. The wine I received was very flat. Almost like it's been left out for a while. If you need something quick, decent, and cheap then this is where you come."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was fantastic. The bartender was super friendly. The DJ was really good. The hostess was efficient. I enjoyed myself. The atmosphere is energetic. GREAT place."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It has a nice look inside, but it's pretty dark. It's a very pub-like restaurant.  FOOD: Their surf and turf burger was very good. However, their fries were dry and cold and felt like they had been out for a while. Their raspberry mojito tasted like it had no alcohol in it, wasn't a fan. Their portions are also small, especially their mac and cheese. Honestly, you can get much better for the same price at the Warehouse. Would not recommend this place.  PRICE: Although it says 5$, you have to purchase a drink to be eligible to get this menu. Their drinks aren't the cheapest either so I guess that's where they catch you.   SERVICE: It was decent. They did what they were supposed to do, nothing more."}
{"text":"We tried this place again, this time on a Wednesday around 8:30 when the kitchen was still open. We were seated right away, but it looked like we got lucky because the place filled up pretty quickly afterwards. We were seated upstairs, where the kitchen is. The restaurant goes a lot deeper than it looks, and I was impressed how they set up the place. It was a little crowded, but they managed to make it work.   All the dishes are $5 but you have the choice of adding extras. I got the fried chickpea salad with a side of naan bread ($1.50 extra). Just be aware that the portions are really small. So if you're really hungry, it's probably not the best place to go. The salad was great, but the size of it was not worth $5. The naan bread was slightly burnt. The drinks were better. I got the Sweet Ginger and the Republic. The Sweet Ginger was amazing, but not strong.   I ended up spending around $30 including tips so the $ is deceiving."}
{"text":"Great food for 5$ especially when compared to the McDonald's and Subway close by.  I visited twice in under 24h.  The first time, it was Monday evening, at like 9:45. The place was packed but we were seated real fast. We had a braised beef poutine, a classic burger, and a red curry soup.  The braised beef poutine was tasty, but it didn't contain much beef. I was told today that we could add more beef for 2$ extra.  The classic burger contained good flavors. I could clearly taste the garlicky sauce, the homemade ketchup, the bacon, the american cheese. But the patty. It was burnt and dry as hell. It literally had a thick crust of cremated beef on the outside and dried out mince on the inside....like really really 'well done', except 'well done' beef = no good beef. Now, for all you food police out there, don't hate: beef is supposed to be eaten medium rare. You only eat your steak well done when the meat is not fresh.  Anyway, the red curry was very average. Nothing particular, you can probably invest that 5$ elsewhere... like on a cinko hot dog hahahaa....   So I just had the cinko hotdog today and well... it was good for the price. It's basically an average tasting hot italian sausage on ciabatta bread, with a scoop of mac n cheese spread all over the plate. Oh, and there was raw beetroot on the bread. Eating it was a mess so if you're there on a date, AVOID AT ALL COST!! Otherwise, pig out like no one's watching (everyone's prolly too damn drunk to notice anyway).   I also happened to have tried the braised beef pappardelle. In one word: salty. Granted the portion was relatively small, but the density of salt in that little pot of pasta was too damn high. I wouldn't take it again.  Hope this review helped you indecisive eaters choose :P"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is young and hip. Great music choice for a rock fan like me. The food is fantastic especially for the price. And the portion is quite big too. They also change their menu quite often. Service wise, the wait staff definitely deserve their tips."}
{"text":"On était super excité d'y aller car c'était à côté de l'école et on pensait que c'était pas cher. Malheureusement, ce fût le contraire. Le service était vraiment pas bon. On a attendu 20 minutes avant qu'un serveur nous amène de l'eau et le restaurant était vide. 40 minutes plus tard on a enfin reçu notre nourriture et elle était froide. On avait 1h30 de pause et on est arrivé en retard à notre cours... Le serveur n'est jamais venu voir si la nourriture était bonne donc on a avait pas de sel, pas de poivre ni de ketchup.  Lors de la commande, le serveur nous a obligé de commander un breuvage en plus de notre repas sinon il nous aurait charger 2$ de plus. Donc c'est 7$ pour le prix avec ou sans breuvage. C'est contre le principe du prix à 5$. C'était decevant. Nous y retournerons pu."}
{"text":"Good food and so affordable (how awesome!). If I understood correctly, plates are 7$ but if you buy a drink, they're 5$ (super sweet!). The cobb salad was veryy good - great ingredients! The portuguese chicken was alright. I didn't loveee it. Other Portuguese chicken I've had have been more tasty. Cool place/ambience, but a bit too loud."}
{"text":"Honestly the only reason to go here is for the beer. Less than 5$ for a pretty decent glass of a few varieries of beer is a better price than youll find most places around here. The food is all 5.55$ which is about what its worth to be honest. I had a surf n turf burger, the beef patty was pretty much overcooked and on the verge of being burnt, but the shrimp on top where cooked perfectly and were tasty. Fries were meh. Would recommend for beer but thats it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I ordered the chicken entree and it was literally like 2 Bites. 2 pretty good tasty bites. If you're going to serve it as a tapas use a smaller plate. I know it's supposed to be cheap eats but presentation still matters!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on our last vacation to Montreal. I had the fish tacos with salad and he has the surf and turf burger. The food was very good and their drinks are also very good. Eating outside was very nice and it was not too crowded. The employees are very friendly. The prices are VERY good!"}
{"text":"the food here isn't the greatest but i did enjoy the cutlet tacos (plus it's soooo cheap). would be a 3 but i ordered the white sangria, took ONE sip from it and didn't like it so i asked to get it exchanged for a red one. idk what policies are here in canada, but i've never been to a restaurant that wouldn't switch out drinks if you didn't like them. what a shame."}
{"text":"Si vous me buvez pas vous pourriez vous en sortir avec une facture assez economique et le ventre plein, les portions sont suffisantes et le prix tres raisonable : 5$ par assiette , formule original tout à 5$. Plusieurs tables, ambiance assurée !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself at cinko- the atmosphere was delightfully charged for a Thursday evening, the music was great, the decor was unique and exciting (there's hand-painted zig-zags on everything, including the toilet bowls) and the food was really good, especially for the price.  If you're not familiar with the concept- it's pretty simple: all food plates at 5 big ones. I would contend that the portions are actually quite generous for the price, and the items we ordered (the green bean tempura poutine and the gravlax salad) did not fall short on taste. The alcohol menu is not priced the same way, but I can attest to that everything is still pretty cheap.  I would recommend this place as a start-off to a night out, especially between the outdoor seating and the large group booths."}
{"text":"A very popular spot with an excellent marketing model - all the basic dishes are priced at $5.00.  Very hard to find a better quality price ratio in downtown Montreal - or anywhere for that matter.  The portions are not huge, but totally adequate.  The food is good.  Good burgers (including veggie burgers), great fries, good fish tacos, good General Tao chicken.  One innovative dish we tried was the Haricot Poutine - tempura battered green beans with cheese curds and a side jug of gravy.  With two vegans in the party we decided not to pour the gravy over the beans but saved it as a dipping sauce for those of us who weren't vegan.  The service is attentive and quick.  The place was quite busy at lunch, but we were fortunate to get a booth for the five of us that allowed us some privacy, comfy seats and an ability to talk without shouting.  A selection of beers are on offer - domestic ones also priced at $5.00."}
{"text":"C'est 5$, la nourriture est super bonne. Il faut prendre en considération le prix, je le répète! Possibilité de manger comme un roi pour  15$. Meilleur endroit pour se restaurer entre potes! Regardez les photos elles parlent toute seule!"}
