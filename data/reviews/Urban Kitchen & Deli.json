{"text":"The food here is pretty good, unfortunately the service is very slow. Each person's meal came out 5-10 minutes after the previous person at the table. Seems like they prioritize takeout so everyone in the restaurant has to wait MUCH longer. Easily 4 stars with quicker service."}
{"text":"Urban Kitchen and Deli is a great place to eat at with your family after enjoying the many things to do in Cleveland. They have great service and amazing food at affordable prices.  Urban Kitchen has a great variety of different foods from around the world and has become one of my favorite restaurants to dine at. I extremely recommend Urban Kitchen and Deli to anyone who just wants a great home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"visited here while staying at the Cleveland Clinic. The portions of food were generous and carefully prepared. All 5 people with our party enjoyed their meals which varied from Fish / pasta / Salisbury Steak / Gyro / salad.  Definitely would return for another meal here."}
{"text":"Despite all of the yummy lunch offerings, I went with buttermilk pancakes and they were some of the best I've had. The service was also very good and they let us stay as long as we wished to visit and chat."}
{"text":"ALLLLL DAY BREAKFAST! Definitely a plus!! Also a very diverse menu with a great selection of foods for just about any craving. Including halal meats!
I personally love that they have turkey bacon/sausage-not many places do.
I've always had a great experience here; wether eating in or taking out! The food is great!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday. Pretty much had the place to myself. Spent the better part of 2 hours having lunch and preparing for a meeting across the street. 

My server was very friendly and had no problem with me squatting while I waited for my meeting. Kept my water and coffee toped off the entire time. 

I ordered the Cajun chicken salad for lunch. It was outstanding and very spicy, like I like it. A fresh grilled chicken breast (good sized) on a bed of spinach with a few cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and roasted red pepper. I had their Greek dressing on the side and all was very good. 

Would have given the place 5 stars based on the above, but then I asked for a cup of coffee. The waitress brewed it fresh, but I think they use Maxwell House, which should be called Maxwell Shit. Not a big fan. Don't like the flavor, or lack there of. 

Anyway, I would come back anytime, just get a Diet Coke!"}
{"text":"Had the hashlet and Rueben. Great corned beef!!! Nice  atmosphere in great location. Parking in back. Owner came to table and took order. Will return."}
{"text":"All of their food was good, but kebbe was excellent.  It was fast and clean.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time food was great, I had a veggie omelet with very fresh eggs and lots of fresh veggies delicious and came with hash browns definitely the best of both I've every had at a restaurant. My hubby had the Cajun cod dinner and he also thought it was delicious. We'll definitely put this on our favorites for dining out. Staff was very helpful and didn't hover. Desserts looked awesome but didn't have room-next time! The music was very pleasant to listen to, very lovely experience and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"We went to this place based upon previous reviews on yelp. We were not disappointed. We ordered the meatloaf, the gyro, and the rocky balboa sandwich. All of which were wonderful! Also the server was terrific. She was one of the owners and could not have been anymore kinder! We were visiting from out of town but if we lived in Cleveland, we would definitely go here on a regular basis. The babaganoush was the best we have ever had and the coffee was delightful."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the breakfast slammer and my Husband had the Rocky Balboa, each of us were extremely pleased with our choices. The service was pleasant and attentive as well. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner on Saturday. Urban Kitchen still hasn't let us down.

The food came out quicker than expected. I ordered the Reuben. It was stacked higher and more delicious than last time. The meat was juicy, not too dry like some Reubens.

My wife had the chicken tender appetizer with fries. It came with four or five sizable breaded chicken tenders. The chicken was juicy, so they weren't just frozen tenders. Both of our dishes came with plenty of fries. We love this place."}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick bite! Best decision ever. Food was excellent. Great service and affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I ate here recently and had one of the best customer service experiences of my life.  I was in from out of town and my coworker and I barely made it in before 9pm due to a late work day-I hated to be those people but we had no choice and they were VERY accommodating.  They moved the owners car so we could park closer, kept the kitchen open until we were ready to order, and turned the NBA game I was trying to watch on the TV with volume. The food was great (I had the Philly Cheese Steak), the ingredients were fresh and the portions were large.  I will definitely be going back next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"A solid neighborhood restaurant that offers a large, diner-like menu and occupies a spacious, bright venue on the ground floor of a new building. 

They've got all the diner favorites that you can think of, whether salads, wraps, sandwiches, or burgers, but I opted for some of the Mediterranean items on the menu like the \"health platter,\" which is a selection of hummus, baba, tabouleh, grape leaves, feta cheese, and olives. A smorgasbord of flavors - some rich and savory, others tangy. 

I found service to be reasonably fast yet a bit perfunctory; the fact that the server was coughing in the background did little to enhance my appetite even though I was roaringly hungry coming in. Nevertheless, there should be something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"YUMMY! While playing hookie from work decided to stop in right after they opened. Corned Beef Hash Omelette was devine! Cannot wait to try dinner or one of delicious looking burgers. Affordable and convenient."}
{"text":"We had two meals here while at the Cleveland Clinic. Lunch was a classic burger, side salad and tabouleh. The waitress also brought us a hummus and warm pita bread appetizer that was on the house. The hummus and pita bread were so tasty, the tabouleh was fresh and flavorful. The burger was cooked properly and the accompanying fries were crisp and seasoned well. For dinner we had the Reuben sandwich, Salisbury steak with a side of coleslaw and Black Forest cake. This time we ordered our food to go. We didn't have to wait long and the food was still hot when we got back to the clinic. Everyone enjoyed their choices. The corned beef was lean and not overly salty, the Black Forest cake was moist, fresh and not overly sweet, their portion sizes are very generous.We were very happy with the quality of food, atmosphere and service. If you are in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the Philly steak and cheese, and baklava. Wow, a hidden treasure. Some good things on the menu from breakfast to dinner. We will come back when we come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really glad we came here good is crazy good. Best burgers had in a long time. Nice place to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a breakfast spot before driving back to Columbus and the Urban Kitchen had a good website and diverse menu. It was shortly after 12pm and we were the only people in the restaurant, not a good sign for a new restaurant.  If we hadn't already paid for parking we would have left.

My wife really wanted French Toast and I was looking for lunch.  The menu said that the French Toast came with powdered sugar which my wife informed the waitress that she did not want.  I ordered the cheeseburger and fries.  It is worth noting that the waitress did not write anything down. About 20 minutes later our food came, my cheeseburger and a waffle. Yes, a waffle and not French Toast.  Since we were the only people in the restaurant when we ordered it's hard to believe that they got it wrong.  Also, the waffle that came out appeared to be of the frozen variety. We sent that back and waited another solid 15 minutes for the French Toast.  When the French Toast came out it was covered in an obscene amount of cinnamon, which the menu didn't list at all.  My wife did try to eat it but after a few bites she was done.

I went up to pay and told the waitress about the cinnamon and her response was that cinnamon was listed on the menu.  Since there was a menu right next to us she did pick it up to check and there was no mention of cinnamon.  There was no apology and no offer to take the French Toast off the bill.  

While I was paying the restaurant received a call about a takeout order that had issues.  Also, there was another couple that came in while we were there and I overheard a discussion where their order was also not right.  

To be fair, the fries that came with my cheeseburger were very good.  The cheeseburger did not seem seasoned at all.  In summary this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  Hopefully, they'll take this information and improve.  They've got a long way to go."}
{"text":"If you are near the Cleveland Clinic, Urban Kitchen is an amazing place to grab a home cooked, creative meal for lunch or dinner. The owners are wonderful, generous, and passionate about their food. Be sure to try their cakes (dessert before dinner!). They also have Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes that are outstanding, such as their hummus, pancakes, and fattoush."}
{"text":"A super nice family owned restaurant. This place is really a gem. Whether you are looking for regular American food or authentic Egyptian-middle eastern food this is the place to go. Try the Koshari (staple Egyptian food) and you will not regret it. The place is very clean too!"}
{"text":"I noticed the Urban Kitchen last time I was in town and decided I would give it a try.  It's an easy walk from the Miller Family Pavillion at the Cleveland clinic, and well worth the effort! I had the Pasta Béchamel, an Egyptian favorite.  Layers of seasoned ground beef with penne and the most velvety béchamel ever.  I think they cracked an egg over the top before baking, too.  It was exquisite comfort food.  The portion was generous, so I left half for lunch tomorrow and still walked away very full and satisfied.  The gentleman at the table near me had what looked to be a beautifully roasted half chicken with rice pilaf and veggies.  Might have to try that next time. Brave the construction, or take a walk from the CC, but get to the Urban Kitchen.  Lovely people, lovely food."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared meals with a variety of choices. Grama, dad, and son were all happy. Good burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the owner and staff of this place are very nice and I want them to succeed in their business as this place definitely has potential. That being said, there are a few things they can improve on. The concept of the dishes on the menu is there but the execution is lacking. The beef burgers have absolutely no seasoning in them, not even salt, please season your burgers. Once I ordered Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta and while the taste was good, the chicken and shrimp were not mixed well, meaning 3-4 shrimp and small pieces of chicken were just placed on top of a huge bed of pasta. The proportion of meat to pasta was totally off. So the concepts are there but please work on the execution and that'll be great."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Very friendly, clean, and professional. Ask for Moe, he'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a couple days this summer for my own wedding, and had the pleasure of going to Urban Kitchen & Deli two days in a row. The first day, I got the Ruben, which was delicious, and generously portioned. The second day, I got pancakes, which were also outstanding. But the thing that really stood out was how kind the owners and staff were. When I mentioned in conversation that I was getting married that weekend, the owner was so sincere in her well-wishes; and my family and I ended up having a little dance party with the staff. Just the nicest people, who also happen to be running an amazing restaurant. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I plan to come here every time I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pancakes, scrambled eggs, and hash browns were all good. Mac N Cheese bites were pretty good. The mozzarella sticks were okayish. My husband liked the onion rings and the waffle fries were also okayish. Alfredo pasta was like a 3/5. I think this place is good for breakfast and sides. The food was fresh both times we ordered, which is why I added a fourth star."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy place to go for lunch. Nice variety and large portions. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Wow! Super delicious :) I will totally order food from here again."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for brunch based on the reviews on Yelp and it's location being close to CWRU.  We all very much enjoyed our meals. Really enjoyed the corned beef hash and the Reuben sandwich.  I had Some of the best turkey bacon I've ever had. Service was great, very friendly and attentive. Definitely will be back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"(Will preface this by saying I got their food through a delivery service, but read on to see that this is probably not particularly relevant). Apparently my experience is an aberation based on what some other yelpers are reporting, but I really felt the need to pass this along. I got a bacon and cheese omlette and home fries that were so bad I could not even finish them. Honestly I'm surprised that is something that's even possible, given it how much I like breakfast food. There was an off-putting watery liquid in the middle of the omelette but I gave it a chance. The cheese ended up being bland and very generic. And unfortunately I had to pull out a piece of the bacon and eat it by itself to be sure that they didn't put some other type of meat in my order.  Sadly I'm actually not exaggerating.  I stopped eating the home fries pretty quickly as well because they pretty much only tasted like oil and I could feel the oil squeezing out into my mouth each time I took a bite, which really turned me off. Not trying to torpedo anyone here, I'm honestly just posting this because I because I felt like I washed my money and my opinion is that this place at best needs a little better quality control and ingredients in their omletts."}
{"text":"I know this might sound weird and I cannot explain why I feel so strongly about this, but Urban Kitchen has the best dang chicken fingers I've ever tasted in my life. Those babies are moist and juicy, seasoned well and have the perfect amount of crunchy breading on the outside, making it a dish like Goldilocks' - just right in every way. I've tried some of their Egyptian menu items, as well, which were also tasty, but keep going back for the amazing chicken tenders. They get five stars for these alone."}
{"text":"Great food with a lot of options to choose from. Reasonably priced. Very friendly and quick service. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service with even better food. So personable and friendly. Came here while my mother was in the hospital and they were so warm and welcoming it made my family relax for even just a minute, which we so desperately needed. Everything we had was great. Went in with a party of 7 twice and every item was a \"oh wow that's good\" moment. Service was speedy and accurate. Definitely go, you won't regret it."}
