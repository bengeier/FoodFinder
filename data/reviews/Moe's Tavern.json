{"text":"Great little place that takes you back a few decades with the music, arcade, and decorations.  Full bar and good thin crust pizza.  I had pepperoni and red onions on mine and downed the whole thing!  Most people will be fine splitting 1."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good corned beef sandwich at literally half the price of what I paid at Slymon's."}
{"text":"We stopped at Moe's for dinner before a play. The atmosphere has a 90's vibe with vintage video games.  We ordered the pizza and it was delicious with a good crusty crust.  They also serve wings which looked delicious.  The bartender said he is increasing his menu and should s have more items by next week.  The beer selection was interesting and the cocktails were very good.   We will be back."}
{"text":"(based on one experience)   stopped at Moe's tonight after a concert considering it was one of the only places left open late in CLE. low key spot with a laid back vibe to match. great music and decor! (love the 90s)   as for the food, no complaints. sour dough pizza was excellent, enough for at least 3/4 to share for $14. wings were delicious as well. love the simple menu, doesn't need much.   Raphael made all of us feel super welcome which I truly appreciate. can't wait to stop in again when i'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been meaning to try this place for awhile. I finally came around to it and I couldn't be more blown away. The inside has a very cool 90's theme, decked out with a few 90's arcade games. The bar is big and there are lots of TV's. This is all great, but the food was what is going to make me come back. I'm pretty sure the only two things on the menu are Pizza and wings, but by god, they have the best pizza and the best wings that I have had downtown. And I have lived downtown for 4 years. The wings especially were out of this world. Such good food that I was compelled to write a yelp review. And the bartender was awesome as well.   I would rate is 6/5 if I could"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after visiting Becky's...it's a 90's themed bar equipped with free video games and incredible pizza that's available until bar close. It has a close tie to The Simpson's ... ask the owner Rafael."}
{"text":"Of you like the 90's, fantastic food and great atmosphere then you have to eat at this place. This Tavern is the building/bar that moes bar from the Simpson's television show is based on. This place is freaking awesome. The owner is a great guy and very nice. As soon as you get t-shirts bud I want one! If you are in the area you habe to eat here!"}
{"text":"The best place in the world. Oh my god the pizza. Great selection of beers and Raphael is an awesome person!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great craft drinks and IPAs. We ordered the Turkey Caprice and Springfield salad and both were amazing. I love the music and vibe. August the bartender was A+. Fantastic service and friendly!!! Try this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place late one Saturday night, they were the only place that was serving food, and it was sooooo good! I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are amazing. Probably the best blue cheese dip I've ever had. Made in house! Great beers on tap and learned some cool history about the bar. August is a great bar tender!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, good food n prices. Free to play arcade games. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. One of the best bars in the area."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here , good food especially the wings ! Talked with the owner for quite awhile very enjoyable night and free video games , would definitely recommend and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place plenty of times. Decided to finally stop in for a drink after a show. The place looks great. Very clean, inviting, and great 90s decor. Not a lot of people there for a Friday night so I'd probably have to blame that on their drink prices. Has potential to be a popular place with the location."}
{"text":"Finally Cleveland has pizza to be proud of. Their live yeast comes straight from Serrentino Italy. With yeast roots from there with a five hundred year history how could the crust be anything but phenomenal. I love great crust. Great chew. BTW the toppings are pretty incredible too! 1740 E 17th Street, CLEveland 44114"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Cleveland.  Original Moe's. The one you see in the Simpson's. Come check it out!!"}
{"text":"Oh man this pizza makes me miss living in NYC. It is the only good pizza I've found in Ohio. Also a nice selection of beers on tap and cocktails."}
