{"text":"We have been in here numerous times and the pizza is always great.  They have a nice selection of quality ingredients that you can choose to build your own pizza and the food always comes out quick.  The real reason for writing this review is not to rave about the quality of the food, but the exceptional service that we experienced tonight while dining in.  The staff are always really friendly but tonight when I asked for a gluten free pizza, they stated they were out of the dough.  Chris (perhaps the manager?) decided that he would go out to pick up more of the gluten free dough, and he dropped what he was doing to run out and get more.  Throughout the experience the staff was friendly and checking up on us, but the fact that they went out of the way like this to accommodate a customer was something that I have not seen before.  We will continue to go back as the food and service are both top notch."}
{"text":"Christopher, the manager, ensured my first experience was delightful & scrumptious. I truly will never EVER digest another slice of pizza from anywhere but this restaurant. & I'm not kidding so if you think I'm kidding, I'm not. My pizza was ready to be devoured upon arrival. This pizza urged me to look up words in the dictionary to describe its tastefulness. Thank you Christopher for beautifully crafting my unforgettable pizza, honestly, truly."}
{"text":"One of the higher quality fast pizza joints with a friendly and welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"The price is right however the ingredients could use a major upgrade. The Italian sausage looked horrible. They should have prosciutto or arugula to add. I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Well Im very disappointed,  they change the cheese . They used to serve the best cheese  Grande  Now it's switch to  what everyone else service .  Cheese is  horrible"}
{"text":"First things first. Absolutely WAY over priced. The total came out to about $17 + for a large pizza. So basically I can never afford to eat here again which is a shame because the pizza was actually good. There was like 9 people working but no one inside? When you drive by and see no customers you clearly aren't going to go out of your way and spend $ 20+ on pizza?!?!? Pizza is suppose to be the ultimate take-outfood ? Lower your prices and I guarantee you'll have a bigger customer following. $$$"}
{"text":"They serve amazing pizza for a VERY reasonable price. You can add however many toppings you want for the same price as a classic pizza. The cheesy bread was delicious and much larger than I expected for the price! Service was extremely friendly and attentive. They keep the restaurant very clean, too, which is perfect if you want to dine in, but it's also very quick if you have somewhere else to be. I would HIGHLY recommend eating here if you want quality pizza for a great price!"}
{"text":"First time here.  It was so good!!  I went back the next day can't get enough.  Customer service is always great.  There was a sweet red head girl named Kaitlyn there that did my pizza.  She had such a great attitude  and u could tell she loves her job.  I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"We came here for the 1st time just because we were in the area and it sounded interesting. The pizza is fantastic, with plenty of toppings to make it just the way you like it. On our 2nd & 3rd visit we had the wings and they were excellent too. Chris, the manager remembered us and was very accommodating. All of the employees are friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. No wonder we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was okay. I ordered the philly which was not quite a normal philly taste. When I went to add one other topping to it they wanted to charge me extra. Weird that I could built my own for $8.95 with as many toppings that I wanted including all the ones on this pizza, but when I ordered a menu item at the same price they wanted to charge for extra toppings. Probably should change that policy. Overall a fair experience."}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant experience here! It's not in my neighborhood, so I had no preconceived notions about the place. I stopped in for a quick bite while I was waiting for my kids.  The atmosphere is fairly bare bones and it is somewhere between fast food and a sit down place. However, everything was very clean. The red (padded) booths/chairs and black tables were comfortable. The concept is quite similar to Fired Pie, but I thought the pizza was better. The crust was slightly thicker and more chewy, which I enjoyed. I had a meatball pizza and I found it to be a bit on the bland side, which is why I rate a 4 and not a 5. To be fair, my family frequents a sit  down restaurant with excellent meatball pizza (fresh buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil garnish), so it may not be a fair comparison.  Next time at 1000 Degrees I will try a custom order.  What was remarkable about my visit was the staff. Each person was friendly and helpful. The guy who greeted me asked if I'd been in (I had not) and took time to explain how the ordering process worked. The cashier was having trouble getting my receipt to print, but said I should go ahead and get my drink and sit down and he would bring me the receipt, which he did. When my pizza arrived (less than 10 min), still a different gentleman apologized for the delay, saying he started a new pizza for me because he didn't like the looks of the first one. When I was leaving, I managed to spill my soda all over the place. People came rushing over and took the cup and asked me what I was drinking so they could pour me a refill (in a brand new cup). By the time I had my new soda in hand, the mess had been mopped and a \"caution - wet floor\" sign erected. Clearly all the employees are engaged and very customer-service oriented. It was much appreciated!  If you're looking for a casual pizza or salad meal in the Scottsdale/101 area, give 1000 Degrees a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Love the crust and fresh ingredients. Can't beat the service and friendly staff. 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, short wait time, in & out, amazing quality, friendly staff. I prefer this pizza over Fired Pie. I also ordered for my daughters birthday party and they were an absolute pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"Showed up on date night 6pm Friday and they were closed? They have only been since June, wonder what's going on"}
{"text":"We went there because the gentleman on the phone told me that they had protocol for gluten allergy food handling. I shouldn't have trusted them. We ate there and I have been sick since. Ugh!!! So frustrating being told gluten allergy protocol and that was not the case. Please don't offer gf if you don't actually serve gf!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is OK but the restaurant needs some adult supervision.  There were at least four, maybe six, employees yesterday evening around 6:30PM.  The \"2 minute\" pizza took 20 because nobody was preparing the pizzas.  Three employees were chatting up a storm with a group of teens that came in and did very little the entire time I was there.  My to go order was wrong - ingredients that I requested, and were read back to me by the person that took the order, weren't on the pizza.  The Caesar salad was nothing but lettuce - no cheese, no croutons, nothing but chopped lettuce and a tub of dressing.  Overall, average food and underwhelming service.  If you want to try it, better hurry because this restaurant will likely close in the next 6 months."}
{"text":"Ordered a 10\" build your own for $8.95. Brought me the wrong pizza. Asked what was on mine. Came back and asked if mine had basil on it. No. Came back again, said they'd have to remake it, they put basil on by mistake. Funny I didn't see them put basil on it as they were making it. Gave me a card for a free pizza. Had to reorder as he wrote it down. Was not impressed as they made my pizza - ridiculously small amounts of ingredients. Like 6 slices of pepperoni? Still waiting for my pizza... It is lunch hour, but I was the only one in line. Ok, pizza is here, pretty good.The guy who remade it was more generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"Ask for extra sauce. I ordered the Meatza, meat overpowered it. Fresh mozzarella is a nice touch. It was hard to get service after you ordered. Place closes at 9 but when we walked in at 7:45, chairs were on the tables and they were closing off parts of the restaurants. Ass much as I like the smell of cleaning products, mopping the floors while customers are still dining (during operational hours) seemed to be a poor choice."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great value (unlimited toppings for one flat price) and very good pizza FAST. Jersey strong!!"}
{"text":"One word...Burnt.  Neapolitan pizza should have some burnt edges but this was awful. No excuses because I was the only one in there ordering, it took 3 people to make my order yet no one mentioned that they burnt it. I found out when I got home.  Nice!"}
{"text":"this is hands down the best pizza place in the valley! the service is off the charts!!!! randy, chris and team are so friendly and go out of their way to ensure that you leave with the best experience possible! they never leave one customer left unnoticed! love this place! if you haven't been you are missing out!!! -m&m go now!!"}
{"text":"Place looks good.  Variety of pizzas and salads is good.  We had a pizza and salad. Salad was very good but pizza was just OK.  Might give them a second chance."}
{"text":"If you like Neapolitan style pizza, you will love this place! I am a pizza snob and I love it. They use fresh high quality ingredients and the pizza is ready almost as soon as you sit down. The crust is light and tender with crisp and a little char. I had the garlic cheese bread with homemade ranch dressing. Very good and I'm not a big fan of ranch. We topped it off with some gelato. Great dinner! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly staff and excellent food quality. Went out of their way for our little nieces. Was already a fan but they went up another notch."}
{"text":"This is a no-brainer review.  This was the best pizza that I have had in years (and that says something, because I'm from Italy and have had some pretty good pizza in my day).    It's the same concept as Mod Pizza, but so different in terms of taste.  The dough is amazing and reminded me of Italy.  The pizza was cooked just right and for the price, I would say a better option than going to Mod Pizza, The Lamp, or any other higher-end pizza place.    I tried Copa Di Vino there for the first time (having seen it on Shark Tank), and was not very impressed with the wine quality, so this place would benefit by bringing in some better quality wine.  Overall  -the pizza was amazing!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"GREAT PRICE. Great taste. Fun environment. Great customer service. I can go in and I will - lol - This place satisfied every pizza craving I ever hoped to have ever been blessed with having! I'm just so picky when it comes to satisfying my Marinara and cheese needs but 1000 Degrees of tastefulness granted me that wish. I was quiet. The whole time. Just eating. Staring at my girlfriend and smiling from time to time but mostly just eating. The little times we talked it was only to express how great the customer service was and that they willingly go out of their way to get you the EXACT kind of pizza you want. When I give this a 5 star rating I don't just do it because they served every need I could possibly have but it was so much fun too! Something money can't buy. They have an oven there that cooks your pizza in 2 minutes! Something about 1000 degree vortex that sensually cooks that baby and all of its fresh ingredients into a thoroughly cooked PERSONAL masterpiece. When have you heard of something like that? Want pizza? Eat it here. Seriously. Go out of your way to eat here because damn. Sorry for the rant!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice but made me feel hurried. I get it. They have a line. However I am the paying customer so slow your roll please. LOL!   I had the New York style from the menu. Soooo very good. They have the soda machine with 50 different options - I am huge fan of that.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, superb customer service, and well priced. Definitely adding this to our list of places to visit frequently!"}
{"text":"Literally the Best customer service I have ever had.  Chris went WAY out of his way to take care of us (like others have already said). The guy can probably lead seminars on customer service. : )  He made a special pizza for my 1yo daughter and came by and chatted with us a few times.  He served, bussed and was spot on with timing too.  Looked like he was taking care of the whole place.  Everyone there seemed to have a great working relationship and seemed like they really enjoyed working there.  The kitchen was really clean and organized and everything seemed really fresh.  Thank you so much for such a great experience and for taking care of my family!  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having a thin crust high fire crispy crust pizza but this wasn't it. Ordered the philly yet it was too vinegary and had to ask for the pizza to be recooked longer since he has none of the crispy bubblingness . Still wasn't right so took it home & has to convect oven it and the flavor still wasn't great. The dough had a weird smell and none of the true crisp."}
{"text":"I appreciated that as soon as we walked in the girl behind the counter greeted us and asked if we had been there before. We said no and she went through how it worked. My fiancé and I chose to split the 10\". I got the Classic Margherita on my side and he got the Meatza (this is considered Build Your Own and was $8.95). Personally, I like fresh basil on my margherita pizza (as shown in the picture on their website which is why I'm giving them only 3 stars) but it was still good. We also liked the char marks on the crust and had some killer gooey cheese as we pulled our first slice off the pan.   It's nice to have a freshly baked pizza brought right to your table in less than 10 minutes, when more often than not your big chain delivery pizza shows up lukewarm and an hour later.   This is a great place to go if you don't have a lot of time and don't want to spend a lot of money.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying 1,000 degrees pizza. Great place. We did the build your own pizza. Pretty cool you can get the pizza exactly how you wanted it. Crust had great crunch. Staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Go see these guys! So much better than all the other comparable pizza joints. Consistently great pizza and great service. They always make sure you're getting what you want the way you want it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - price & location are good, interior has plenty of seating & was clean - but food just didn't impress.  Chicken wings were soggy, which made eating them unpleasant, but buffalo sauce was ok.  The 2 pizzas that came out were a good size, but the margarita had very little cheese & sauce was bland.  We did a \"make your own\" & added quite a few toppings, and it's great that they don't charge for extra toppings, and it was better but still wasn't overly impressed.  Crust seemed soggy, and again just bland flavor.  Everyone has their own preferences - I guess this just didn't cater to mine."}
{"text":"While on vacation, I really had a desire to have pizza and after some searching on Yelp, came upon this little gem. Stuck in a strip mall, it didn't have the \"look\" I was expecting, but the service was good, quick and the food excellent.  You order at the bar kind of cafeteria style. Since the oven is really hot (see name of the joint), the pizza is cooked so fast.   We had the Tuscan chicken and Philly pizzas and both were just excellent. Really crispy crust, fresh ingredients, and nice people serving."}
{"text":"AWESOME pizza!   I've been to many different Neapolitan pizza places and this is on top of the list!   Where have you been all my life????"}
{"text":"The pizza was really delicious, my group got the meat pizza, the four cheese, and a custom, plus wings and cheesy bread sticks. However, the ordering process could use some tweaking. I noticed they were getting mixed up on the family ahead of us, and mixed us up a bit too.  So you order and they write it down on papers that stay with your pizza, but then when you get to the register you have to tell the cashier everything your group just ordered. I didn't get my cheesy bread sticks and had to show my receipt to get them about 10 minutes after the pizza. They need to use carbon copies or something for the customer to hand the cashier.   A note about plates - they're paper and you only get one so it's a bit hard to cut pizza for a child. The drink machine is pretty cool. And the prices are pretty low for such good pizza.  I would recommend the place.  We are from out of town and don't normally get pizza while traveling, but it was really very tasty!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and very fresh!  Tons of options and quick service.   The Sriracha sauce is a must try"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday afternoon around 3 PM. Place was dead.  Was pleasantly greeted and had the menu and process explained very nicely to me. I ordered a small pepperoni and cheese pizza, just to keep it simple and to test the quality of the food.   The pizza was described as a personal size pizza, but it easily fed three of us for a lite lunch.  I think it took longer to assemble the pizza than it took to cook. It was in and out of the oven in two minutes and tasted delicious.   The crust was thin and dusted with cornmeal.  It was nice and crispy, not soggy like the other place in town.  The red sauce was plentiful and tasted a bit sweet. The toppings were sufficient, but not over-the-top.  If this were the only pizza in town, it would be great. However, there are other alternatives for better pie.  The novelty and the speed at which the pizza came up was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I like coming here for individual pizzas because my husband and I like completely different toppings. This was our second visit and just as good as the first time. I got the roman crust this time, because the pizza crust is my favorite part. It was perfect! I also like that the pizza is cooked throughly. No wet droopy middle like other places with similar pizza. Friendly, quick service as well."}
{"text":"This place has fixed some of the issues with the soda fountain and the amounts of toppings they are putting on etc. Pizza is a science of the right amounts of sauce, crust and cheese etc. They have gotten better.   Still doing the tip thing on the register, which is annoying. But a better experience the few extra times we have been there."}
{"text":"Top Notch. Great food and over the top service. They Bent over backwards to make sure everyone was happy. What a great place. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"A solid fast-casual concept restaurant.  Quick service, good food and discount offers galore.  I've had both the New Yorker and Margherita pizza pies.  Both had a perfect crust, charred outside and slightly chewy.  They also had a bright, tangy sauce and good cheese on it.  A 10\" pie is just the right size for one hungry person, or split by two if you add a salad or some other menu item.  I will (and already have!) be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the customer service was fantastic! The owner was very nice and approachable. I had the smoky pollo pizza and added artichokes and it was amazing! I will definitely be going back!   The minor downsides - not a lot of seating and because of the 1000 degree open oven it was pretty hot inside. Luckily I work across the street so i will definitely be going back for more but to go"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by 1000 degrees. I was unaware that it is an assembly line pizza place, but that got me excited because my thoughts instantly were - can this be better than competitor Fired Pie? Unfortunately not in any category.   We had a large size pizza with the same \"combination\" type pizza toppings we always get at FP. The crust is a bit thicker like a normal American style pizza. Something about it just screamed bland. Each bite got less interesting. I think it was a combination of the sauce, cheese and possibly the toppings. Fired pie has a few meats that are not offered here which was disappointing. Overall it was a get me over pizza - filled us up but did not satisfy.  We also had honey wings which were small but decent. I probably would skip them next time.  To top it off the whole place was extremely smokey from the brick oven which I thought was strange. And the decor/seating is nowhere near as nice or comfortable as Fired Pie.   The staff was friendly but unfortunately this didn't make up for the mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I don't NEED to come back. Mod Pizza is better in terms of quality of the food but not the service, 1000 degrees has better service. The location of is great, easy in, easy out but the pizza wasn't worth mentioning. No desire to recommend or come back."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!!! Our first time here tonight. We tried 4 different large pizzas off their menu.... Everyone's favorite was the Smoky Polo! The mac n cheese was good too. Crust was perfect not to thin , not to thick!  They also have gelato, but we were to STUFFED after all that pizza. Great spot"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza for the price.  I like 1000 Degrees better than Mod or Fired Pie in part because the crust is a lot better here.  The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I did not care for the taste of the sausage on my last pizza but all the other toppings have been good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good for fast pizza!  Very friendly staff too.  We ordered through Uber Eats once and it was good so we went in and ordered 6 pizzas.  Very good for the price."}
{"text":"excellent pizza for the price and really tasty!    very friendly staff.  if you didn't like your pizza then you as a customer didn't get the ingredients right!  wish they have a draft beer selection and more of a traditional wine selection even if small but i understand.  very cute little casual place."}
{"text":"As another reviewer said, I wanted to like this place. But upon entry the young lady behind the counter did not greet us, she just slightly smiled. We'd never been there so did not know the drill. When we asked, she spoke in low tones and had to repeat herself - we can hear just fine so speak up, missy. Also, we bought a salad along with our pizza. She said \"please pay down there.\"  We did. When we asked about the salad we did not have yet, the lass at the cash register said \"oh, go back and we will make it for you.\"  Well why did you send me to pay if I now have to go back and get my salad made?  There was no list of ingredients so she kept asking what we wanted. Well...what have you got?  Overall, the pizza was okay, the salad was okay - but the service was inept. They were not rude - just not trained in food service at all. A lot of staff but some were just walking around not really doing anything. Go some place else if you don't was frustration with your 10\" pizza."}
{"text":"It's our first stop to 1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizza and we both loved our pizzas. I got the build your own and my fiancée got the Tuscan Chicken. Nice and crispy and done in a flash! Servers are really friendly. You can expect to have great pizza and an enjoyable experience here. Saw tons of orders going out with Uber Eats so you could also get your order delivered."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Great wings!  Awesome service! If you're in the Loop 101 & Scottsdale Road area, this is a must stop. Make sure you say hi to Chris. Absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"We're new to the area and have found one of our favorite pizza spots. Very friendly staff and clean space. The pizza definitely stands out as the best when you compare it to other similar places. Love a pizza with good yummy crust!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good pizza delivery and boy did we score. We all ordered individual sizes and ended up sharing, which was amazing! We got to try 5 different specialty pizzas of theirs and they were all so good. The mac and cheese pizza was awesome, but I think my favorite was the Smokey pollo pizza. The chicken isn't the crap from a bag most places use, it tasted like freshly grilled chicken breast. And the sauce was amazing and unique. I would definitely recommend and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"With so many pizza places in the Strongsville area, it's finally great to see something that stands out from the rest of the other places.   It's located in the shopping where the Costco is, close to I-71.   You can purchase a 10in or 14in pizza, if you're on a hot date and extremely hungry, grab the 14in, it's only $16.95 and load it up with unlimited toppings, mix it up any way you want, or you can get one a pizza of the menu. Either way, they are all good.   Customer service is fantastic here, each time we have came to eat at this establishment, owner was there and made small talk with us.   We were here a few days back and after we received our pizza, owner walked by to see how we were doing how the food was, realized that we had way to much sauce on our pizza and was adamant about remaking it so we can fully enjoy the experience here, which we did remake for us. We will be back for the great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Great pepperoni pizza! Ordered through the yelp app so they weren't quite ready when I got there. They were really nice about it, rushed to get the pizza done, and gave my son an ice cream while we waited.   Great service and great pizza!"}
{"text":"This is another BYO-pizza place, amongst several other chains in the Scottsdale area. Came on a weeknight after a late night workout close to closing. Was a bit starving, so I opted to build my own 14 inch pizza with some wings. 14 inch will give you 8 slices, and a second visit showed 10 inch yield 6 smaller ones. After doing sauce, multiples cheeses, meats, and veggies, I was off to the races.   An excellent rendition of wings here. I liked how they par cooked it first, took it out, and then finished it off in the oven to time it with my pizza. Rosemary garlic was pretty bomb, and having the wings roasted made the bites juicy without excessive oiliness.   Like others have said, the sauces are really good. My biggest praise is how fresh the vegetables looked and tasted, and that everything was diced so it was easy it to eat. I've been to some more popular places - I don't know who thought it was a good idea to cut a broccoli floret into halves and call it a day. Here, everything blends together well.  The knockout aspect of the food here is this is the only place that has given me a thick, fluffy crust. I know NY style pizza is thinner and easier to cook in hot ovens, but it gets super old when EVERYONE DOES IT. Hell, at this point, some of them overcook it and it tastes like a matzah.  Besides the numerous perks I enjoyed from coming, this stood out to me amongst the most personable experiences I've had making one. The guy helping build my pizza had a joke-filled camaraderie with a co-worker that was borderline infectious. And at the register, a well meaning young man was being taught by a manager how to proceed with checkout. Pretty cool family vibe I got to see. It was so sweet I didn't have to buy gelato at the end (but my little bro tells me it's really good!).  Build your own pizza usually is just one of many options for a new meal for me. But 1000 Degrees actually offered me something I would look forward to for the next visit."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Quick and fast once it goes in the daddy of all ovens for 2 minutes:) Friendly staff - they want you to get it just the way you want it. Open to suggestions and will prototype an Alfredo option soon- Randy the owner is all about the customer."}
{"text":"We have had pizza all over the world including Naples Italy. This pizza from a strip mall location in Arizona puts out one of the finest I have ever had without any conditions. This now makes two of the finest pizza pies that I have ever had in Phoenix, not NYC not Naples, not DC or Chicago. The white out pizza is to die for. Good crust that is chewy, balanced flavorful sauce and high quality cheese. Thank you for the great service Chris! Side note the gelato was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The staff is super friendly and the pizza is delicious. I'm from Chicago so can be pretty skeptical about pizza out west but this pizza is excellent. Try the Sausage and Peppers, little bit of spice. It's like being back home."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an average pizza then this is the place for you. I ordered a regular pizza with garlic cheese breadsticks. There really was not that much flavor too it.  The breadsticks were pretty decent and the service was pretty good. The place was pretty clean as well. Overall this pizza place was just average at best."}
{"text":"Having moved recently from New York to Ohio, we were, of course, on the search for a GOOD pizza place. We saw that there was a new pizza place in Strongsville and decided to check it out. We're so glad that we did!   1000 Degrees has many of the usual pizza place offerings, but what I really liked that set them apart is that they make the pizza in front of you along the lines of other fast casual places like Chipotle, etc. You get to completely customize your pizza, even choosing from a few different sauce options. The final step is when they put the pizza in their massive fire oven, which you can watch cook your food. It's really neat watching the flames blast away while your food sits on a wheel and cooks. We were told by the manager (possibly the owner, I think?) that the oven is very unique-the bricks come all the way from Italy and are made with volcanic clay from Vesuvius. Pretty neat!  The food is delicious, and of reliably good quality (sometimes that can be lacking at pizza places!).  The location is very clean and the staff is very friendly. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome & the pizza is unique & flavorful. We tried it for the first time today & absolutely loved it! The pizza was phenomenal & we will be back! Great people & pizza!"}
{"text":"1st visit:  I was looking at their website. Found a photo of a pie that sounded/looked good, but couldn't find it on the online order menu, so I called.  Mgr. told me that pie was no longer on the menu (no wonder I couldn't find it).   I fumbled a bit, not having a back up plan when Mgr. says, \"Hey, how about I throw this and this and that together for you, on this base?\"  I'm like, \"Right on!\"  Mgr. says it will be ready in FIVE MINUTES!    WOW!  I jump in the car and cruise the 2.5 mikes to the shop. My pizza had just come out of the oven. Mgr. opens the box for my inspection. Beautiful pie.  Great flavor. Very good medium, thick crust that held up to the ample toppings.  Over-the-top pleased with the speed, flavor, and service.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great location, amazing customer service and they are fast. One of the better pizzas I've ever had and chicken wings, their chicken wings are baked and not fried , can you say healthy! Thank you to all the staff for your amazing service. I will definitely recommend, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We visited 1000 Degrees during a long weekend in Scottsdale. We wanted something relatively quick, moderately priced, and tasty. We loved everything about our experience. We both ordered make you own pizzas, and were both very pleased with the outcome. We also had a beer (Michelle Ultra and yummy Fresh Squeezed IPA), Caprese Salad (very tasty and much bigger than expected), and Cheesy Bread (which was extremely cheesy, but my only comment would be to ask for more garlic - if you like garlic...which we do). A complete meal for ~$40 + tip....wayyyyy more food than expected with great fresh ingredients. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the amazing service. These guys were all scarily pleasant and accommodating. The manager and another employee checked on us a few times during our short time in the pizzeria. We would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing! Their employee Chris knows what he is doing! I have never been let down by the quality of chicken and the flavors they have! If you like robust, order the Pesto My Way which are not on the menu and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"On vacation looking for a late meal saw this place and the name caught our attention. My husband's good friend is a international Neapolitan official trainer so needless to say he has had A lot of pizza :) This is Not true Neapolitan pizza but it is very good. Service was very good and the pizza tasted delicious the next day. Ordered the white pizza with black olives. They have a seasoned olive oil that is very tasty, great for dipping the crust. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, wasn't great. Dough is very bland, pineapple was Hard I had to remove it. Wings are precooked and re heated, then sauce is added on, and tasted burnt and meat inside was slimy like the wings you get from the freezer section at the grocery store. Half the tables were covered in crumbs but place seemed kept up and clean. On the list of tried and probably won't eat here again. ~B~"}
{"text":"The margarita pizza is the best I've had in the greater Phoenix area. Very quick and friendly service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and the pizza was just as superb as it was the first time!  The customer service here is literally OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Better than most fine dining restaurants!!! The employees here are so friendly!  I'm shocked the line isn't down the street and around the building!  Food is delicious and the costumer service is fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was downright awful and some of the worst pizza I've had in a long time. Was with two other women and no one finished even half of their pizza. Complete garbage, which is where all the uneaten pizza ended up. A frozen supermarket pizza would have been better.  Underwhelming crust, no texture or firmness. Heavy and bready and undercooked in my opinion.  There are some great pizza options in Phoenix, even in the fast fired area, but this clearly isn't one.  My Pie, Fired Pie and Blaze are all better than this by a wide margin. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fast and affordable. They have salads and chicken wings.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.   We had the meatza pizza and it was a 10!"}
{"text":"The pizza place is originally from the east coast so it's expected to be amazing. And, that it is! Love this pizza place! Work right across from it. Eat there at least 2 x a week. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I decided to go in the place and try the pizza, man, was it bad. I am from NYC originally, so I have known bad pizza when I have tried it. This was one of the worst that I have ever eaten. The staff were nice, the pizza was just absolutely horrible.   I ordered the regular Margherita. There was very little cheese on it, and this seems like a trend these days for cheap pizza bosses to cut down on the cheese. There was a lot of sauce on it though - sauce is a lot cheaper. The crust was fine and soft. I actually liked the salad more than the pie! I just used the soft bread with eating the salad.   I will say that the crust was not that inedible, cardboard crap that one gets in Pizza Rut.   The place is really a fast food franchise dump, like Wendys, Jack in the Box, or Carls Jr., with the whole look and feel. I noticed that the staff had to wear cheesy t-shirts with the company logo on it. The boss probably doesn't even pay them 10$ per hour! I had to choose a table that wasn't dirty from previous clients. Like I stated, this is totally inside the pizza fast food world.   If you are a pizza lover, stay away from these pizza fast food joints - and go to a real pizza place, or a true Italian-Mediterranean restaurant.   It was not cheap either. The pie and the salad cost around 30$ - and we did not order any drinks. After eating this bad food, when I arrived home, I had to take a trip to the bathroom. Enough said."}
{"text":"Great pizza and they have a super friendly staff! I am pretty sure they are all related and if not, they sure do act like it! Their location is somewhat hidden so if you go to Harkins 101, head further east in this parking lot and you will find them next to Pure Barre, Orange Theory, and One Stop Nutrition... horrible neighboring businesses for a pizza restaurant! ;)"}
{"text":"So, This review is directed to the Scottsdale location, but I couldn't find their location here on Yelp. I went on opening day and the pizza was great! We each received a free personal pizza with unlimited toppings. Staff was wonderful, and the manager came around to each table and asked how we were. Definitely coming back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Firstly this pizza is just damn good. Being a Detroit gal, I am used to good pizza and this place hits the spot. I always build my own pizza and they make it right there in front of you and you can add as much as you want. And the topping options are endless. The owner is just an amazing guy. My family and I stop by often and feel right at home. We always receive the best service and are treated with the utmost respect. The manager is also an awesome guy. They truly understand good customer service. They make sure everyone in the restaurant is pleased with their meals. With great food and service, you can ask for more."}
{"text":"We were there 11-25 @ 7:30. Pizza was good but when the management is away the kids will play! Pure chaos. The girl that was working seemed to be the only one that cared. Chris you should check on your employees more often."}
{"text":"My verdict: meh! Anyone familiar with real Italian pizza like they have in Italy would find this horribly mediocre. Our pizza came with a doughy thick crust, burnt on the bottom, cooked very fast, all the toppings were normal and unremarkable. Stick with Pizza Mod or Fired. My Cabernet was chilled and rot gut quality for $5.  Cashier seemed unfamiliar with the products and routine."}
{"text":"Amazing as always! My family absolutely loves this place! We appreciate the consistency of friendliness and incredible food! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant, but it won't be my last. I placed my takeout order online, which was a very easy process. When I entered the restaurant and walked toward the back to pick up my food, I was greeted by several people. The restaurant was spotless and I could see several people working. I believe the man I spoke with while my cheesy bread finished baking was the owner. I was pleased when he offered to help me to my car with the large box containing my cheesy bread and a good sized container of salad. The best part came when I put dinner on the table. The cheesy bread not only looked good, but smelled good and tasty delicious. I couldn't believe the size of the salad. This was a Build Your Own Salad. I couldn't see the lettuce for the thick topping of meat, cheese, and vegetables. After filling two plates, we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and then some. Everything was fresh and tasty. What a bargain for $7.95! I will soon be back to try a pizza. I hope that many others discover this restaurant which is tucked away in the plaza in front of Costco. It is definitely a hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place while looking through yelp (we were craving pizza) and we couldn't be happier that we stopped. The owner was super friendly and very accommodating. We will be going back and defiantly recommend it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and the staff are always very nice and helpful. I like being able to create a different and unique pizza at every visit. Its a little bit pricey ($8.95 for a personal size pizza) but the quality is very good and its always a nice place to visit. I will certainly being going back."}
{"text":"A new pizza joint - National Pizza Day - there you go - Kismet!  First things first - it's called 1000 Degrees, but the oven was set to 775, if I read it right...and I think the actual temp was even a little lower than that - you may think I'm being nitpicky, but the crust wanted to be baked in a hotter oven (gummy and a bit tough).  I ordered the Johnny Meatball.  First thing, the dough balls get dumped on a layer of semolina about 2\" thick and stretched.  Then the crust is put on a peel and covered in a pie crust shield for saucing.  The sauce, btw, was really pretty darned tasty.  Good mozzarella (maybe a bit much). The meatballs - not my favorite.    The interior is really nice, and they've got the Coca Cola Freestyle machine (Lime Coke!).  I'd probably be up for giving them another try with a different topping, but the crust really needs to get reworked - and 86 the semolina!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and they make it right in front of you, toppings to order!!! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to try this... I've been to Italy and sadly I wasn't really a fan of brick oven pizza but I love thin crust. I have tried other \"quik\" pizza places and have been wanting to try 1000 Degrees Neopolitan. When I walked in I was greated right away. I thought to myself if this pizza is half as good as their great customer service I'm lucky. From the beginning of being walked thru the menu (I chose two different pizzas on each half) to watching it being made, he never flustered when I changed/added toppings.  Thank you. I got home and tried a slice from each side and I'm a fan. I can't wait until my son and husband come home to get them their favorite toppings in a pizza. Also, he mentioned they have a thicker dough but I stopped him I was happy with trying the thin, not so thin. Very very tasty."}
{"text":"Visiting town and saw that this place was new and well-rated and decided to give them a shot for a late afternoon lunch... The place was dead on the weekday afternoon, which was convenient!   Ambiance is fine, nothing special, typical strip mall restaurant.   Layout seems logical, think of Chipotle style set up (should have just gone there).   Crust is nothing special IMHO, more similar to CiCis than real Neapolitan pizza. Though the oven is legit. Would have like option to order whole wheat!  Toppings were average to good - would expect more gourmet than what was offered. We ordered the sausage and peppers and the SW pizza (non-pizza sauce - beware) since we are visiting the SW.   Sausage was good but quantity left something to be desired. SE pizza was eh, would definitely not order that again! A few of the options looked very similar- would have appreciated more help deciding on what was good. If you know what you like - opt for the make your own option - they do have different sauce options.   Can't speak for the salads or wings. Since we are visiting, probably would not be back or recommend for those foodies with limited time wanting something unique.   Average overall."}
{"text":"They have an abundant selection of toppings and the employees we're very accommodating with requests. It was very loud inside so you need to make sure they hear you. I made a comment of \"I don't prefer smokey bacon\" after she made a comment that they had smoked bacon. She promptly smiled and said \"then you'll like this\" and put bacon on half my pizza. Argh...She was so pleasant that I didn't correct her, but also didn't like my pizza as much because of it. The pizza crust was good but not great. My husband enjoyed his pizza too.   Overall we thought the pizza was good and would go back again."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Highly recommend the Tuscan Chicken pizza and add pesto to it.  Absolutely delicious.  The staff was kind and courteous.  And even on a busy Friday evening the wait time was very minimal.    Only feedback for the restaurant is that someone from the staff offered our son gummy bears, which was super sweet.  I just wish they would have asked us parents first and on the side.  It put us in an awkward position since our son has a really hard time processing sugar late at night.  It makes bed time very difficult.  Because of this he typically doesn't get evening time treats.  Another great option might be stickers."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here! What was I waiting for? I really enjoyed the pizza I took home. It was Sunday evening, later in the evening, so it was dead but that just made the personal engagement even better. We were quickly greeted by the owner who acknowledged it was our first time there. He gave us a comprehensive explanation of the different pizzas, asking us what we usually like and made suggestions. I ordered a sausage & peppers pizza for my husband and a small cheese for me. My pizza was to die for! Perfect amount of cheese and sauce but the crust was the perfect combination of crispy, crunchy and chewy. The owner had a great sense of humor and even tolerated my girlfriend who'd had a glass of wine or two!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place during Cars and Coffee which is held in the parking lot, they are kind enough to open very early and provide coffee & donuts. I came back for lunch and I'm glad I did, this place is a real find.     The pizza is excellent, the place is exceptionally clean and they have one of those fancy soda machines.    They serve beer which is a plus. I also had The Caprese salad which was delicious. Prices are very reasonable. This seems to be a small family owned business and they are present and involved which is something I look for. Five Stars, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was good and the delivery came on time, I was just not a fan of the pizza. It was very average and I would most likely order dominoes before this place."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place!  I stopped in for lunch today and had a wonderful experience.  The Pizza and salad were delicious and the ingredients for pizza and salads are bountiful and fresh!  The balsamic dressing was one of  the best I have ever had. ( I LOVE balsamic dressing).   The place was super clean, even the bathroom.  The employees were very nice and the owner even came over and introduced himself and asked how everything was.  It tells me a lot about the business when the owner is there shaking hands with the customers!  I LOVED this place and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had free pizza today as part of their opening day celebration! Apparently the first 10 customers that came in received free pizza for a year. Everyone else that came in today received free pizza for the day.  The best free pizza I've ever had. They have unusual sauces there: Spicy sriracha sauce. Olive oil drizzle. Pesto drizzle. BBQ bourbon - so much yum!  How does 1000 degrees compare to mod pizza or pieology? It's right up there with the greats. Fast casual, customizable pizza is extremely popular right now. 1000 degrees is honoring this new trend most excellently."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was quite good. Although we like garlic, the cheesy bread sticks had way too much garlic & we didn't enjoy them. I don't think many kids would eat them. The restaurant was clean & the staff was friendly. It's a bit pricey compared to some other pizza restaurants, but the pizza is served quickly."}
{"text":"Best pizza and service in AZ! I highly recommend you check this place out ASAP. You'll be hooked."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  Friendly staff, very warm and entertaining environment, great pricing, choice toppings (which are unlimited for one flat price).  And they're healthier than most pizzas because they don't oil their dough.  They hand stretch with semolina flour.  Oh, and they offered gluten free to my friend who's on a special diet.  But the best part....I was there last night and not only did the owner come great our table to make sure all was okay, but then he went over to a table of four clearly happy customers and started speaking Italian - all of them.  I almost felt like I was on a trip to Italy....and the pizza tasted like I was also!"}
{"text":"I was here for the Grand Opening as the first customer back in January 2016, and have been a fan since! Even if you're here for a half-hour lunch, they get your custom pizza built and cooked in a matter of minutes. I have yet to have a bad pizza from here, and they have seasonal specials every so often, which includes a Southwestern pizza. If there's an ingredient you don't particularly care for, they can swap it out or just not include it. Along with the pre-determined varieties, you can also do Build-Your-Own. Along with Pizzas, they also have salads, wings, gelato, beer, wine. The management, Chris and Randy, always want to make sure your orders are great every time and that you keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has good pizza BUT...once I had almost finished it I realized that the parmesean cheese shaker I had been using had several large clumps of green mold within the container. I did not see it at all from the way the container was facing until the last time I used it on my last slice. I took the container to the person that appeared to be a manager and told him I had used it on my entire pizza and all he said was \"were you sitting over there (pointing to the bar seats along the window)?\" to which I responded with NO...I was sitting here in the complete shade. All he did was hand the container to another employee to tell him they needed to be checked. He did not apologize or even acknowledge me after that and continued talking to the other customer he was speaking with so I walked away. It seemed as though the excuse would have been that the container was left in the hot sun BUT for the fact that I was sitting no where near that area.   Overall the pizza was pretty good but the management and customer service was very poor. I would not go back here and if you do, pay careful attention to the parm cheese containers! Maybe other products as well."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a good price and it's ready quick! Clean, casual dining room. Staff was friendly and helpful as it was my first time here."}
{"text":"Pizzas are good.  Wings and Salad are ok.  The owner or manager preparing the pizza doughs was great.  We ordered 2 14\" pizzas a margherita and a pepperoni.  I also ordered some wings and a Caesar salad.  The wings were a miss for me.  Prob won't order them again.  The salad was just an average salad with a supermarket dressing packet provided.  But that's all ok.  You come here for Pizza.  Also just make sure you check your pizzas before you leave.  We ended up getting somebody else's pie a pepperoni and sausage with tomato. We were home already by the time we noticed.  No problems we'll roll with it. I just hope the owner reads this and takes note."}
{"text":"Growing up in New York I am very picky with my pizza joints. Tried the Cheese Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza. Both were above average. Staff was super friendly and service was quick. Price was on Par with other good pizza joints."}
{"text":"really delicious pizza. the dough and crust were really good. made us think of NJ boardwalk crust/dough. fast and friendly service. very clean shop. cool that they have the coke machine you can choose like a million flavors. just fyi - give the pizza a minute to cool off before digging in. trust me, it will be hard since it looks and smells so good. another great addition to scottsdale 101 plaza. grab some pizza then walk over to harkins for a movie."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza joint, the crust has a very unique flavor and really makes the pizza pop. The atmosphere could use some music. Don't bypass the wings they were fantastic. The pizza is very good, it tastes unique because of its noticeably fresh flavor. The crew was fast to have my order ready when I got there."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Owner Dino is the best. Friendly place. Clean. Always asking how things are and if you need something."}
{"text":"We we were driving by and saw this new place. Needed lunch so we stopped. His place is new so very empty at about 4 pm in Monday. They cook pizza in a rotating pizza oven at 1000 degrees. Takes 2 minutes to cook. The crust lacked flavor and complexity. I thought it might be because I got my pie well done, but my wife's pie which was not well done also lacked flavor. It tasted like it was just made. Not like dough that rises slowly over night or longer in the fridge. This was disappointment. The best pizza places ferment their dough for 2-3 days. I would suggest a longer slower rise.   I had the opportunity to talk to the owner who came in as we were leaving and he assured me that he let the dough rise for 48 hours. If this is true then he might see why the crust has little flavor.  They have lots of toppings. 6+ sauces. Everything can be customized. They also have gluten free crust. Service was great. Very attentive. You order at counter and it is delivered to your table in about 2-3 minutes.   My wife gives it a 3/5 and I give it 4/5. For fast food pizza it is very good. Service is 5/5"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food, friendly staff, clean, and nice atmosphere. Build your pizza or salad your way- lots of healthy choices too!"}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza. All the toppings you want for one price. Came in on the grand opening and waited about 45 minutes for a free pizza. Highly recommend and will be back soon."}
{"text":"It seems like there is a new pizza joint opening on every corner lately. We happened to be up on Mayo doing some shopping and noticed this place. The toddler found pizza an acceptable lunch choice so we gave it a try.  The staff was super friendly and helpful. The place is clean and nice.  The pizza is great! I made my own selection with pesto, chicken and olives. I also chose the fresh mozzarella which as some places does not taste so fresh. It was great here. My wife and son split a margherita pizza. They both really liked it.  Over all this place does a great job. The dough was awesome, the topping seem really fresh and the people were really nice. This place will probably be our go to for a quick pizza in the future."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza I mean really yummy pizza  Great customer service clean spot everything was perfect"}
{"text":"First the pizza is so good. The people their are really nice and they give great service. The people their make you feel like your in your own home.  Their are so many choices and all of them are good. Lastly everything is homemade and delicious . I will be returning and also ask for Chris to help you."}
{"text":"Tried this new spot out the other day and it was amazing the place was very clean and the staff was so friendly i had The White Out best pizza i had in the valley this place will be in my too favs!! Nice job guys."}
{"text":"I come here probably once a week and it hasn't let me down once! When I come in Chris always greets you and treats like family. It's always a great experience. These guys are amazing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Scottsdale. Thanks fellow yelpers for steering me here. Good pricing and very clean set up. Had thhe Smoked Pollo pizza and it was so yummy. Fast friendly service thanks to Manager Chris!  You need to try it"}
{"text":"No surprise that this place has such great ratings. We are transplants from California and I don't know what it is with Phoenix but I have no idea how it got one of the top spots for pizza recently in  zagat imo it's pretty tough to find good pizza. But after today I'm pretty sure this is going to be our go to spot. The crust is absolutely perfect nice and crusty outside just the right amount of 'soft' inside. High-quality ingredients sauce is just right sometimes other places put way too much sugar in the sauce taste like fresh homemade marinara of which I'm sure it is.awesome customer service just an all-around great place this one's going to be our new favorite"}
{"text":"The pizza was phenomenal but something even better was the service:) I won't be going to any other pizza place any time I'm out here :) highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I know you're probably thinking do we really need yet another fast casual pizza place offering up $9 pies made in 90 seconds?  I entered with that perception and I left firmly convinced that this is the one fast pizza concept worth keeping around.  The price point is on par with Mod or Fired Pie but the quality is a step up.  It honestly tastes pretty close to a Neapolitan original.  They also use great quality ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes.  And to top things off they've started off with great customer service.  A great lunch spot for those who want Pomo but are in a hurry and want to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Very good, fast pizza. Nice thin crust baked to perfection.  I love the core freestyle machine too. Be aware,  there is no beer or wine available.  The only dings were that there were a lot of dirty tables andslim pickings for sauce options and meats.  We had to clean or own table even though there was ample seating.  The crust and toppings were very good, but the sauce was quite bland, hot  peppers helped to jazz up the slices."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza in all of Arizona!!!! They le you make your own & add as many toppings as you like!!! The crust is beyound amazing & the array of toppings are never ending!!! Also I tried their gluten free pizza for the first time & it was the first gluten free crust that didn't taste like card board but actual delicious pizza!!! Chris is the most talented pizza maker I have ever met & his customer service is unbelievable, he always goes above & beyound & makes my day!"}
{"text":"This seems to be the latest addition to the \"make your own\" pizza places.  Pieology, Fired Pie, and some others.  This place supposedly has their oven at 1000F (to cook faster?).  You are allowed to make your pizza anyway you like.  If you want more meat or sauce or cheese, no problem.  All for one price. It's a nice concept, but how is the pizza?  Well, first the staff was very friendly.  They seemed almost eager to be helpful.  So that's good.  I kept it simple.  They had many choices (e.g. sriracha sauce), but it's hard to judge a pizza against its peers if I do something different.  So marinara sauce (plus a bit extra...she wasn't putting on enough), mozzarella (again...put a bit extra), pepperoni, sausage, onion, peppers.  Simple and basic.  The pizza came pretty quickly.  Which is good.  I don't know if it was the fact that it cooked quickly that caused two giant bubbles in the dough (the tops of which then burned since they were closer to the heat source than the rest of the pizza), but that's what I got.  A minor annoyance.  But how's the pizza?  Ordinary.  Nothing special at all, in fact.  The crust didn't have the light crunch to it except at the outer edge.  It wasn't raw, but it had the consistency of sandwich bread.  Soft.  No light crunch.  The sauce (which is the base of the flavor of any pizza) was flat.  Added very little flavor or character to the pizza.  The toppings were plentiful, which is nice.  Their flavors were OK (the bell peppers in particular tasted fresh).  But overall a really lackluster performance.  Someone once said to me they preferred this place to Grimaldi's.  Really??  For me there is no comparison.  It's like comparing a Big Mac to a filet mignon!  Not even in the same league!!  Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't horrible.  But \"I've experienced better\" definitely describes this.  If the salad had been better I might have been able to go to three stars, but that was unimpressive also.  Without a big coupon I probably won't come back.  Grimaldi's is just a 5-minute walk away, and sooooo much better.  NYPD is just down the road, and it's better too."}
{"text":"This is a fast-food joint, not a restaurant. Sure, service and food is quick, but the food is what you'd expect from fast-food. Decidedly meh.  Upside, my 4 year old liked the pizza."}
{"text":"Want great pizza? 1000 degrees. This place is awesome. Friendly owner and staff.. I'll update this review later too busy stuffing my face with this yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Came in late afternoon do not busy. Did the \"build your own\" and was very pleased. Crust was great and just right amount of crispness. I think the oven makes the difference."}
{"text":"We have been here a half a dozen times or so and always love the food and the service.  We have 7 kids (so they remember us pretty well), but they always seem happy to see us and are fabulous with the kids.  They have great pizza at a reasonable price and our kids love the Coke machine (all sorts of mixes and flavors).  Highly recommended for families."}
{"text":"Disappointed in food and service. This place was great when they first opened and now seems to be ran by different owners who only offer subpar service and food. The place is not organized. We had three different employees try to help build our food. During the process they messed up our wings. Quality of food is not there anymore."}
{"text":"This place with the long name is outstanding! Maybe I'll just call it \"1000 Degrees of Excellence\".  The manager, Christopher... excuse me, the General Manager, helped me personally. He was great. He's expert at recommending combinations that work well together. I suggest you go with his recommendations. He made me one of the top 5% of pizzas I've had!  The only frame of reference I had for this was Pieology, where you can get whatever topics you want, and the pizza goes into the wood-fired oven.   This was on a higher level, as much as I (used to) like them!  They probably have 40% more great stuff to add to your pizza.  I had a sauce of, if I remember it correctly, balsamic onions. That really tasted great. It was unique and really stood out, in making this an exemplary pizza experience.  Then I had fresh mozzarella, which was also a welcome taste, and Asiago and Parmesan, all of which Christopher recommended.  And roasted red pepper, I think it was dried tomatoes in balsamic, as well, chopped banana peppers, white onions, bell peppers, chopped broccoli, diced tomatoes, garlic - everything fit well together and tasted magnifico!  This was a real treat to eat. And it was fun seeing it only taking 2 minutes to cook. And Christopher treated me as a real VIP, which was great, as well.  Highly recommended - five-star pizza, five-star customer service, five-star award-winning \"So-Glad-I-Ate-Here\" Experience!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and good value relative to other build your own pizza joints I've been to. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan pizza. Amazing oven. Baked to perfection and fast! We agree with all the positive comments about Christopher the GM. Our only negative relates to the Bon Appetite giant cookies made from (among other chemicals) high fructose corn syrup sweetener and palm oil shortening. My husband, a Cookie Monster, says Chocolate Chip has a non-traditional texture, flavor, and oiliness."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients, awesome customer service, great menu!  Sooooo much better than Fired Pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza concept that works well with unlimited toppings and a good crust too!  Had a loaded pizza. Nownrrs stopped by too. Very friendly."}
{"text":"I wish Randy & his small business the very best! he was such a nice man, he took the time to sit next to us and chat.  He made sure we were satisfied.  Our order was jacked up though we got the wrong pizza & wrong salad.  He apologized and made us new ones, insisted that we keep the pizza that came out wrong , I was very disappointed in my salad it was very blah & boring.  I'm a bit of a salad freak so I know my greens.  I picked out over 40% of crappy lifeless pieces which left me with a handful of leafy greens.  To top it off it had lots of those huge chunks from the butt of the lettuce head ! Gross   However the Ranch was fresh and so was the buffalo sauce.    My man & son said the pizza was just average nothing to brag about, I took 1 bite and was overwhelmed with all the oregano, it's just not my thing.  It was a bit soggy, but the cheese was fresh and not to greasy, large pieces of pepperoni and generous slices.    With so many similar places in the area I might have to pick a different place when in the mood for pizza & salad.    To be fair we will try it 1 more time and hopefully it will be a much better experience"}
{"text":"Perfect meal sized pizza with plenty of unique options for toppings. Chris made the pizzas right in front of me and made sure they were exactly right. Spot on!"}
{"text":"1000 Degrees is my favorite BYO pizza place! You can order a personal size or a large to share with whatever toppings you want and it is out of the oven in a few minutes. It is delicious every time and the manager Chris has the best customer service, he always takes care of us. Would definitely recommend this place over Fired Pie, Mod, or Blaze any day."}
{"text":"Excelent pizza, very fast, good customer service, great environment, etc... The only bad things was not folks for my salad and low napkins. Love the pizza tho! We r coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here due to the overwhelming thumbs up from the community. I will come back in another day, maybe tonight they were just off their game. The wings were bland and was a far cry from the flavor we ordered. The quality of the wing was awful, there were 2 drums that did not have a bone on it. The bone of the wing broke in my mouth leaving shards of bone for me to take out my mouth. The pizza felt like I was eating a grocery store bought pizza that was baked in my oven at home. There was nothing special about this experience. Customer service was top notch, I just wish the food was. Again I will try them again and if they come out on top I will delete this post and write another review. But for now......Two thumbs down....."}
{"text":"Good food, but they need to get their act together.  Staff seems disfunctional and disorganized.  Food was good enough, we might be back."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok... it's just ok. Maybe I'm fussy about my Italian food and especially pizza. First I have a major gripe on the price structure. The pizza is a thin crust pizza and they come in 10\" and 14\". Now thin crust pizza would be bad if you loaded up as much toppings as you would if it was a medium crust or deep dish. So the cost of the toppings is minimal and it wouldn't take much to use REALLY good ingredients. But alas, standard major purveyor quality toppings at best. But while the pizza was decent enough that isn't my problem. The 10\" is $7.70 and the barely larger 14\" is $14.70. So you take the same dough ball and stretch it from the smaller size to the larger one, $0.00 more cost. A small amount of extra topping but almost double the price??? No way. The Buffalo Wings were decent enough and the Chicken Caesar Salad the same but I don't believe I'll be going back. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Angelo's Pistachio Gelato is MEEH. I feel I'm being generous with the 3 stars but they are doing the best they can with being a franchise establishment."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, good quality pizza! Very similar to pie 5 and fired pie, but I think this one is my fave. They have a selection of pizzas to choose from or you can build your own. I decided to build my own and thank goodness the people working behind the counter were patient because I changed my order like 5 times haha. I went with my family and we all ordered something different. My dad got \"the skinny\", my sisters bf got a Philly cheesesteak one, my sister had a build your own salad. I had mine with marinara plus pesto drizzle, fresh mozzerella, parmesan, tomatoes, and basil. After ordering I realized getting basil on a pesto pizza was kinda silly but it still tasted good haha. It was what I expected! Not the best pizza ever, but very good for the price! My family all really liked their food. We also got an order of cheesy bread which was amazing. I wish I would have had marinara to dip it in, so I'll have to ask next time, but it was very good. The service was fast and it was nice and clean in there. I approve!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here and it was totally worth it. The food is amazing, the staff is beyond friendly and the service is unbelievably fast.  We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The owner knows me when I walk in the door bcuz I'm from Jersey and they originated there..... They took an extra 5 mins for my lunch, they gave me and my wife drinks for free and the owner gave me a free pizza coupon  Best pizza in Phoenix, hands down"}
{"text":"Chris the manager is amazing.  He's very personable, friendly, and has great people skills.  He made us feel very welcome.  Great food and great atmosphere!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I just found a great place for lunch for those who work nearby here.   This new pizza place just opened two weeks ago and I enjoyed my quick lunch here yesterday. I was on my way to some other place for lunch but I saw a sign outside said \"now open\". I turned around and decided to try.  I walked in looking confused as I didn't know what to expect. It looks like subway but with pizza ingredients. The person behind the counter seemed to be the owner was patient and took time to explain how their order system work.  He asked if it's for here or to go... I didn't know as I didn't have pizza on my mind until 5 mins ago. I said I guess depends on how long it takes to make pizza... My pizza was ready while I was tasting gelato next to the cashier, it was that quick.. (Yes they have gelato and yes it was that fast to cook pizza).  I ordered white out pizza as I was craving for garlic. While it may not be the best pizza but they were very good for the price I paid. $8 for 10 inch pizza. Where else these days can we find lunch under $10?  I think my pizza would have been better if I took an advice of the owner and added extra garlic. Next time I will just go with his recommendation.  Gelato was good too. How could I resist? They were next to the cashier, looking at me, \"eat me~...\" I had to try. I heard pistachio's voice and decided to try. Gelato perfectly complimented pizza. Pizza and ice cream.. Isn't that a combination of food served at kids' birthday party? Now we get to enjoy that happy feeling at every visit here.  Staff here was well trained and friendly. Can't believe they are only open for two weeks. Didn't have that newly opened undertrained awkwardness.   I would come back to try some more pizza."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of its great reviews. We were so disappointed. The ingredients were not fresh and the pizza had a burnt taste throughout.    And check your receipt before you leave the counter. They charged us double for 1 pizza. They trick you with their tip % choices at the register too - nothing less than 15%. Well, they deserve 0 tip. Bad food, bad service, sleazy joint."}
{"text":"Super fast, delicious pizza.  Set up is like a Chipotle, you can build your own and all the ingredients are laid out up front.  They also have configs to choose from, like \"the Philly\" which I found to be a bit too sweet.  And cheese bread, which is just dough topped with cheese - but the spicy marinara dipping sauce is bomb, so go for it.  We also got some wings - not too much sauce which was great, but way overpriced compared to the pizza.  Literally takes like 2 minutes to cook the pizza so don't worry too much about ordering ahead."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that you can cook an entire pizza in 2 minutes and it would taste as good as it did. If I get back to AZ I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"The Best Pizza is here. Love the love and quality in the product.  The place is clean and fun to sit and eat a pizza in.  Met the owner, very friendly and fun to talk to.  Do yourself a favor, go eat there, laugh and love."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  So many toppings to choose from. The crust comes out perfect with a little bit of crispness, not chewing like other places.  The whole family enjoyed their pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Sort of felt like a chain. The pizza was mediocre. I would prefer Pizza Hut by far. It was also so thin is was thinner than a nacho. We were starved immediately after. Great place for super thin pizza snack but wouldn't consider it a meal."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here! Got some wings and a couple of fountain drinks as well for about $20. You can build your own pizza or get something they created. Either way it's a light and tasty place to try in this area!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Much like Fired Pie, but a little thicker crust. Fresh mozzarella is a huge bonus point in my book! Personal pizza with everything I want on it for $8.95...can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk to this brand new restaurant! The pizza is wood fired in yes 1,000 degree oven and comes out quick. You can pick your toppings or try one of their favorites already picked for you. Gluten Free dough option!  The wings are great. Haven't tried the salads but many options. Not even opened for a week and they know what they are doing! Staff was friendly and the owners are personable, friendly and concerned that all was delicious! Welcome Randy to AZ and good luck!"}
{"text":"We have been to 1000 Degrees pizza multiple times since it opened. Each time has been consistently GOOD!!! Salads, chicken wings and pizza all DELICIOUS. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Convenient location for great dinner idea if headed to a movie at the nearby theaters. Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place. We arrived at about 7pm on a Saturday. We were greeted immediately by the staff behind the counter. We are asked if we had been here before. since we had not the guy explained the options. 10 or 14 inch pizza made to order. They roll out the dough,spread the sauce and add the toppings of your choice. All while you watch.  Friendly services. Clean. Quick service. We would go back.  Head over and give it a try."}
{"text":"We tried their over priced pies last night. Not unique, didn't retain heat so last two slices were cold, and for the money we could have gotten 2 Costco pizzas or one from Buddyz in Queen Creek.  Whoever is rating this high doesn't know good pizza. Skip this place--it is weak mall pizza good for non discerning teenagers and not for those like good pizza pies."}
{"text":"...what a great place! Dropped in to get pizza based on the feedback from Yelp and was not disappointed - the food was fabulous and the lady serving us was so nice and helpful to us Brits.  Big 'thank you' to everyone at 1000 Degrees"}
{"text":"Really cool place to eat in or take out. While I waited for my pizza (2 mins) they offered samples of gelato (yum) and after I got my pizza I realized they messed up the topping. They were so nice about it and just let me keep that pizza anyway. They were friendly and asked me how my day was and the pizza tasted really delicious. I'd recommend them if you want something tasty and fast."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Our favorite pizza hands down!  Very fresh ingredients and a lot of options to build your favorites!  And the service is top notch!  Staff is always friendly and helpful and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"I saw an ad for this new build your own pizza joint; naturally, I had to check it out.  The area is real nice and the place is a good size, clean and people are there to greet you immediately.  The pizza crust is more of the hand stretch regular, it's got a little texture & chew/elasticity to it. After the pizza is put together, it only takes about two minutes to cook...fast!!!  Definitely, will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza and the concept is awesome! Fresh and made right infront of you. I ordered the create your own and my wife ordered the margherita.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Won a free pizza here from Facebook and I was really hoping they would be good, becasuse I usually love brick oven pizza. It was amazing. Tons of toppings and it is awesome to see how quickly it cooks. If you have never been here I would recommend giving it a go."}
{"text":"I've reviewed Fired Pie, MOD Pizza and Pizza Studio. I think I still like Pizza Studio best, but 1000° Pizza is pretty darned good.   Good sauce, which is so very important, is good. Really good.  Strong flavor, when I asked for extra sauce the attendant didn't hesitate. Toppings as much as I want, which in this case was excessive mushrooms, but again no problem!  The 1000° oven itself is interesting, perhaps VERY interesting. See photo.   I asked the attendant why is the high heat, the 1000° is beneficial and oddly, he did not know.  I'm not sure who's in charge of training at 1000° Pizza but I think if you name a restaurant 1000° Pizza, you might want to have a reason at-the-ready for cooking the pizza at 1000°. Not today.   Try this place. It's good."}
{"text":"I love Pizza. I LOVE this place. It's All about the dough.  I've given other build your own Pizza Places 5 stars. But if I had to rank today. This place is Number 1."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a good pizza! So when i saw this place i decided to give it a try. And i gotta say i loved it! Really nice staff. Both managers were doing an amzing job!  Will definitely recomend to anyone up for a amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Just in for a quick bite to eat.  Impressed with the food and service!  Ordered a 12\" NY pizza and 6 Wings with Honey Garlic Sauce.  Pizza, nice tender chew crust, good crust flavor.  Cheese was fresh and authentic.  The wings are fired baked, they were meaty, slightly charred on the outside, tender and meaty on the inside, really enjoyed them.  Stop in, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Love this place! The flavors.... oh my god.  I could eat here everyday.  The Pizzas and the Buffalo Chicken salad are top notch.  My only complaint, really, is that it's a little pricey for a salad but I think overall it is well worth it.  Also love that they have one of those Coke machines with tons of drink varieties. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun fact: If you look on Yelp, you'll find that there are pizzerias that exist with the following names:  - 900 Degrees Neopolitan Pizza - 800 Degrees Neopolitan Pizza - 700 Degrees Pizzeria - 600 Degrees Pizzeria & Draft House - 500 Degrees New York Style Pizzeria  Clearly, pizzeria owners struggle in the area of originality. And until someone opens an 1,004 Degrees Pizzeria, I guess this is the best they can do.  Joking aside, we swung by here recently for no other purpose than to simply just cross it off the bookmark list.  By this point, I think everyone is already familiar with the concept. There's no need for me to keep re-explaining the \"fast casual\" pizza stereotypes. Some do it better than others, but judging by the business these places typically get, everyone seems totally enamored by it.   We ordered the cheaper (and smaller) ten inch option, only because we were taking it to add to some leftovers from another restaurant - which is kind of ghetto of us now that I think about it. We played it safe with a fairly traditional pepperoni/mushroom combination.  Overall, the pizza was fine. It looked very similar to what you'd find at a place like Fired Pie, although the crust had better flavor and texture. Toppings were also decent by the standards of its competitors. It was nothing to get all enthusiastic about, but nothing to really complain about either. For a modern millennial chain, I'm sure it serves its purpose just fine.  Although we didn't get any, at least they do make a bit of an effort to be unique by offering up some gelato as a dessert.  It's unlikely we'll return anytime soon, simply because we have far, far too many pizza places to try out. In terms of fast-casual pizza, however, its probably one of your safer choices."}
{"text":"I will admit that I am not a huge pizza person, so for me to give this place 5 stars that's saying something!  So, why would a non pizza lover chick give this place 5 stars? Well my friends let me fill you in.  - First of all and seriously most importantly - the service is always spectacular. Friendly and helpful staff!   - I can't tell you how many places that will let me load my pizza up like I do for the measly $10.00 they charge.  - The pizza is delicious... I mean it's made the way I want it so how could it not!  It's those few reasons that should draw you into this tasty pizza joint!"}
{"text":"We've been very happy with everything we've ordered. My kids love the macaroni and cheese pizza. Great customer service. The manager has been so nice to my husband and kids. He even brought ice cream out to the kids today. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super impressed! Got a large new Yorker and small meatza. The meat quality is top shelf and the crust is just amazing. Looked so good forgot to take a picture until now. Of all the pizza places like this I rank this #1!"}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by saying how great Chris the general manager is. It's always a pleasure to see him when I come in to get my pizza. He is so customer service oriented and truly cares about the company. He took the time to learn my name and seems to do that with most of his customers. The owner of this place is so lucky to have him represent the company and lead the way for his employees.   As for the pizza - it is seriously so good. I've never been a pizza guy until now.. I'm hooked on this place. It's gourmet and the options are endless. It's the same concept as fired pie but it tastes so much better.I'm not sure if it's the crust they make or the ingredients or the way they cook it but nothing compares.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just had my first experience with 1000 Degrees. A friend recommended me. I order a pizza online and went to pick it up. I was a little early and when I spoke to the staff they apologized that they didn't have my order ready and that they were backed up but they offered me a free drink while I waited. I waited for another 15 minutes and once I checked out they offered me a free pizza next time I came in. They definitely went above and beyond with their customer service and I absolutely appreciated it. I understand how busy things can be during lunch time and have had similar waits at other places and no one has offered the level of service they had given me."}
{"text":"I would like to say... we have ordered pizzas here SEVERAL TIMES now since moving to the area.  Every time... and I mean EVERY TIME I walk in that place... the staff is happy and welcoming.  And in a sincere way, not just \"Welcome, how can I help you\" in an Eeyore kinda way.  Even my wife has been trying new pizzas, which says a lot!  Once she has one kind, she sticks with it and its all she orders.  But this place has nailed it so many times, she's even trying new combinations.  The other night, I brought home one of their Mac N Cheese pizzas.  It normally comes with the mac N cheese as the base, they add bacon bits and mozz on top and cook it up.  I decided to add some jalepenos to it...  Let me just tell you that that's how it should be!  A great way to do something different!   Please add more locations to the Phoenix metro area, as we are now moving to a more permanent location and this location will be too far... :(  Get some more poppin up 1000 Degrees corporate people!   Please!!!!   And keep hiring great staff members!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The pizza sizes are perfect for either a group or single. I like that I can choose as many toppings as I want and it's the same price. The crust isn't to thick or to paper thin. The staff is fast and friendly and at the end is a little gelato stand!  They have about 5 or 6 beers to choose from and sodas. I haven't had salad but the toppings look fresh. Chris is great and really remembers the pizza you like or can give you suggestions. Great place for pizza!"}
{"text":"These people were awesome. From the moment we arrived we were treated with such outstanding and friendly service. Katlyn and Tyler were such a pleasure and made us feel so welcome. On top of that it they truly serve up an awesome pie.  We are very picky when it comes to pizza and have had pizza in some of the best places in the US. The pizza was awesome and just the perfect amount of crispness that I love. The manager Chris was also very nice and hospitable always checking in on how everything was. I can say that this is one of the best pizzas we have had in AZ. We thank you for a wonderful experience and look foreword to returning soon.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so fresh and they make it in under five minutes. Easily my favorite place to get pizza from. HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"We were there for their grand opening. It was nice to see Mayor Lewis there and the Gilbert Chamber of Commerce there also! The food was phenomenal and lots of choices. We also have ordered out to take home and the service has always been friendly fast and the food was again delicious. Welcome to our community!"}
{"text":"ASK FOR CHRIS! We were great by Chris who was so friendly and did a great job explaining the menu and how to order.  I love that it was 5 minutes from the time we ordered to the ti.e it was delivered to table.  If you work in the center they give discount, and they also have a loyalty program.  We got the $8 smokey bbq pizza with blue cheese. It was a unique option so why not.  The pizza tasted good and was hot. They use a 1000 degree oven so everything cooks fast.  The crust is thin on the bottom and the crust was medium size and fluffy.   Overall great value and perfect price point as we feed two for $8."}
{"text":"This is such a cool concept with pizza! It's Subway meets pizza, the right way! You walk in and it smells fantastic in here. You go up to the counter and there's options for different pizzas or make your own. I made my own with just basic cheese. They take it down the line just like Subway does, then they put it in this giant rotating oven. Within about 5 mins it is ready to eat! Such a cool restaurant. My only thing is that it's a bit pricy for pizza but it's definitely worth it! The wings are great and so is the pizza. Definitely come here for a nice day out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here as we came into town. Ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza, cheesy bread sticks, and garlic honey wings.  The kids gobbled up most of the pizza. It was slightly greasy, but overall tasted pretty good. Cheesy bread was decent.  The garlic honey wings were delicious. Staff was super friendly. The ordering process was easy,  and the food came out promptly. They had TVs playing sports.  And they also sell brews if that is to your liking. Nice little pizza joint with great customer service."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fantastic service! I came here for lunch and will definitely be back. Also, the pizza comes out fast, which is perfect if you're pressed for time. The buffalo chicken pizza was my favorite, but any of the choices are delicious!"}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in Arizona if you're used to and a huge fan of the  Neopolitan pizza famous in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.  THE BEST CRUST IN ARIZONA. Make sure your pizza is cooked at 1000 degrees for 2 minutes, 15 seconds.  Since this place has opened I've been 10 times and have had the best pizza I've ever had in Arizona every time.   The chicken wings are delectable, as well.   The only thing that I don't like about the place is that they don't have north east coast style subs.  If they did, I'd be there twice a day, every day.  Also, the owners are amazing.   Ban, the wife, on one of the times I ordered takeout, helped me carry out to my car, because I couldn't alone without obviously dropping something.   The entire staff is happy and glad to be there, too.  PS To the retards commenting on the reviews that it is overpriced THIN CRUST pizza, get a f'ing clue. Neopolitan is far from thin crust. You're showing your lack of IQ. Neopolitan is the only traditional pizza served anywhere in Italy.  Thin crust and deep dish are not real pizza. And are not Italian. They are bastardizations made up by ignoramus Americans, who have zero clue what traditional pizza crust is made of."}
{"text":"Came hear not knowing what to expect in regards to quality and taste of the pizza! I was blown away buy the price of the pizza for a build it yourself which was amazing. I ordered my pizza with my toppings which I really liked to have that option. Once my pizza came I was really amazed at how good the pizza was. It was so good that I ended up eating all of my pizza when I usually don't eat a whole pizza all by myself. If you are thinking of coming here I highly recommend doing so as you will enjoy it and want to come back for a round two."}
{"text":"First visit here for lunch, we used a coupon for 2 pizzas, a salad and 2 beverages.  Staff was friendly and very accommodating, even made a half & half pizza for me.  Pizza and salad were well prepared and delicious.  Only minor complaint is the noise level in the dining area, nothing to absorb sound and sometimes difficult to hear across the table.  We were totally full from our meal and noticed they also have a tempting case of gelato.  Next time...!!"}
{"text":"I followed their Facebook page and won a free pizza so took the family to try it out.  We told the guy at the counter we won and this was our first time. He didn't offer much advice or instruction so we just walked up and started asking questions.   With the glass divider between customer and staff, we couldn't hear him.  The music was too loud.  We had to keep yelling questions about size of pizza and suggestions for the kids and could not make out his replies.  This made for unneeded confusion.  You are a new restaurant with a bit of a different concept, you should help customers better understand what they are doing.    Four of us built our own pizzas and the wife choose the Buffalo Chicken pizza.  The kids liked choosing their own toppings and everyone liked the fact the pizzas were cooked almost immediately so very little wait.  The quality was solid and tasty.  We all enjoyed our pizzas thoroughly.    We have been to other build your own pizza places and will say we liked here better pizza and options wise.  But the lack of a kids size or option is a bit of an issue.  And not being able to hear the guy when we ordered made it impossible to figure out if we could have gotten a pizza for the kids to share or had to get each their own.   We enjoyed ourselves and 4 stars is given because it was tasty.  A little expensive for pizza for a family of five when three are kids that want the experience of building their own and not having to share."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, up there with the best we've had anywhere, including Italy! The dough is light and bubbly with the perfect char (it's not overcooked - - that's how it's supposed to be.) The toppings were delicious. The ambiance is casual and more like fast food than a restaurant: you order at the counter, take a number, and they bring your pizza to the table quickly.   We absolutely loved it (better than several of the \"big name\" boutique pizzas in town) and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh ingredients. Very hospitable and friendly staff. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza and all of the awesome choices.  You can build your own or choose from one of the pizzas they've created from the menu.  I did not have a salad but they sound and looked amazing.  My son had the cheesy bread sticks and they were terrific!  My only complaint was the wait.  I am not sure if they were short staffed or what but from the time we ordered the pizza to when we paid and got our drinks was a little lengthy.  I would definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Great crust - slightly charred, chewy; fresh ingredients, nice sauce.  Totally solid pizza at a really good price point, and very friendly service at the counter.  Staying at the Fairmont Hotel down the road and this was an easy drive."}
{"text":"Been twice now and loved everything about it! The owner Randy is such a nice guy and the pizza is delicious! Fun, trendy atmosphere and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I live close and have driven by so many times but haven't come in before. My son and I decided to give it a try tonight. Great pizza!  And very happy to see they have gelato!  We will definitely be back. Everyone working was very personable, professional and nice."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am from NJ and very OCD. So when I say this place has amazing pizza and it's super clean, I know what I'm talking about.  The entire restaurant is spotless, including the bathroom and every other surface I saw.  Restaurant cleanliness matters a lot to me, but if you don't care about that sort of thing..you will still LOVE the pizza. They use a thicker dough with chewy body, unlike competitors in the \"quick fire pizza\" restaurant genre. They also have more toppings than I've seen anywhere else: ricotta, fresh mozzarella, balsamic onions, broccoli, roasted garlic, artichoke hearts, to name a few. The manager Randy and the other employees craft the pizzas for even topping distribution, unlike some places that just throw it all on together. The pizza had a chewy crust and the toppings were cooked to perfection. The crust also had a slight char (NOT burnt) to lake it crispy /chewy. The pizza isn't \"cheap\" but it's definitely worth it. If you want cheap, get a frozen Totino's at the grocery store. If you want good (super fast) pizza, try 1000 degrees Neapolitan."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I already can't wait to come back. The staff were very friendly and  fast...and the pizzas and cheesy garlic bread are amazing. Great flavors and quality food. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables. Fast food environment and feel. Not so courteous or helpful staff (slow service). The pizza itself was average fast food. Oregano's Pizza Bistro blows them off the the map with an immensely better pizza, not to mention a cozy and comfortable setting (very clean with a attentive staff) !"}
{"text":"Nice idea and concept. However  Bland sauce needs a little kick of garlic or spices. We had a NY cheese, a pepperoni and a garlic and red onion: That one was the best of the three."}
{"text":"Super fast super good, wife and I got the White Out Pizza, and the chest bread sticks were out of this world"}
{"text":"Great experience The staff was very helpful and food so good. Had Pizza, wings and cheesy bread. Will go back Thanks"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, please do. Chris the mgr makes the place fun and welcoming. He has personal takes on pizzas that I highly recommend such as the Margherita. The service is fast and friendly. We have followed Chris from Giant Rustic to Grimaldi and now to 1000 Degree. He is tops in his field and the pizza is great."}
{"text":"We've tried several of these Choose Your Own Adventure pizza shops, and 1000-Degrees is up there among the top. It's my wife's favorite to date, in fact, but I prefer a slightly thinner crust. The texture is fine and -- THANK GOODNESS -- the sauce isn't sweet. The slices didn't crack when folded (even though they were fully cooked unlike some others in this concept), but the crust had a good texture. The variety of toppings, sauces, and cheese is above average, and they didn't skimp when making our pie. I don't know how they are with custom orders.  So what did we try for our first visit? A 14\" Meatza and 1/2 dozen buffalo wings. I shouldn't be surprised, but was, that the wings are baked in the oven and not fried (I prefer mine fried). For baked wings they were good, and I liked that the buffalo sauce had a good kick to it (wife: \"TOO SPICY!\").   The Freestyle Coke machine and it's endless mixes is a perfect complement to a customized pizza. I will note that a 20oz soda is $2.19 though, a little pricey for my tastes, but better than MOD with their tiny cups for that price or more.  Finally, what really pushed the review from a 3.5 to a 4 is the friendly, helpful, and bustling staff. We came on a Monday night and it was dead inside, as the road was blocked, but the staff kept busy even after we were served. Time to lean, time to clean, as they say. Smiles all around, and helpful - the young man even brought the pizza over to us, and put the oven to MAX so the fire would show in my photo."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more - many \"one-price\" pizza places have opened up recently and I was hoping to have a fast/less expensive option to Grimaldi's when pressed for time. But, disappointed on a few items:  1. The Caprese is not a Caprese. We ordered it expecting tomatoes, mozzarella, basil with their balsamic vinaigrette as described on the menu - but it was a little of all those on a bed of lettuce, so NOT a typical Caprese. Would not order again.  2. We ordered that salad first, and never got it, until after our pizza arrived and I had to go back and ask for it. It hadn't even been started. Had I known what it was I'd have let them refund me, but, ah well.  3. As others mentioned, it's loud in here. We came when there were only a few other patrons, but the girl who made half our order spoke so quietly we had to guess and lip read. And when we said it was our first time, like others reported, she really made no suggestions nor offered anything but \"tell me what you want...\"  4. The pizza itself is okay. Crust is both crunchy and chewy in the right amounts. Sauce is okay, but they were skimpy on the toppings compared to Mod.   The one big plus is they have ricotta! The wife almost forgave them all the others because of this, but not quite. We'll give them another try, but if the experience is as lackluster again, the ricotta alone won't be enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and to me better than fired pie and most other pizza places. The sauce is a little sweeter than most and reminds me of a fast food version of Grimaldi's. The quality is good employees are great.   If you like chicken wings they have amazing wings. They grill them in the oven and they are not too oily.   All in all its a great place for a quick pizza and wings. Not many TVs so I would not go for a game but would pick up food for a game there."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza.  Shockingly rude staff.  Our order was prepared using the wrong toppings.  We pointed this out only to be blasted by a rude teenager telling us \"to make up our minds\"  He was the one obsessed with the cell phone before wandering over to make our food.  Understandably, not another customer was in the place.  We were speechless. This place won't be around long!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Fresh ingredients, and the red sauce is delicious. You can order \"their pizza\" or create your own. Pizza comes out fast, and hot with lots of gooey cheese. Place is clean, and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. We went here a couple weeks ago and I'm going back for lunch today. I had the Trenton tomato pie add pepperoni and it was seriously one of the best tasting pizzas I've ever had, the sauce was out of this world. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful and I am super glad I decided to go in and try it. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in along time! Everyone was so friendly and truly looked like they were enjoying being there. It was my first time here and it most definitely exceeded my expectations! Noah greeted us and was very friendly and helped us to decide on a pizza. Great customer service, great pizza, and great atmosphere (very clean!) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in AZ.  Always my first choice for fresh, authentic pizza. Service is top notch and fast."}
{"text":"This pizza is very underwhelming. We drove out of our way to come here due to the 4.5 star rating. First of all, this is not true Neapolitan pizza. The crust is flavorless and  is not wood fired. Second, the toppings and cheese are very bland. If you are expecting authentic wood fired Neapolitan pizza, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We placed our order through Yelp and it was ready 8 minutes later when we got there. Yummy salads and Pizza. The wings were not as crispy as my husband likes but I think he needs to start ordering extra crispy"}
{"text":"Exceptional! I love the Smokey Pollo, and I really want to try some of the other menu items. Has been excellent every time."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Kaitlyn made our pizza it was so good.  Chris the manager is very personable and Kaitlyn took very good care of us.  Food was great and customer service was just as good.  Highly recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Yummmm!! My favorite pizza place in the area. Can customize however you want. I always get the thin crust but they have another option as well. It's kind of in a weird location. A lot of people don't even know it's there. But I hope this place stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese pizza delicious Margherita pizza bomb Buffalo chicken salad unbelievable  Service? The best in Phoenix"}
{"text":"We love this place!!  So many pizza combinations and really fresh ingredients for the salads. Definitely try the Smokey Pollo pizza. The gluten free crust is good too. Chris goes out of his way to make sure everyone is happy. My kids love him!  And they beg to come here just so they can play with the dough. Sign up for their reward program. I get an email once a week or so with great coupons...and a free pizza for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Very good fast casual food. What's not to like about a personal pizza made your way with any/all of the toppings you desire?! Clean facility and a quick meal."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place in the Scottsdale 101 shopping plaza.  I completely stopped ordering delivery once I discovered this gem as the quality is just so good.  I typically build my own pizza.  It's very similar to a Subway in this regard.  You select your pizza size, cheese, sauce, then go down the line selecting your meats and veggies.  At the end of the line, they toss it in the oven and within a few minutes it's ready for you to eat!  I love the fluffy crust, the red peppers have a ton of flavor, and they don't overload the pizza with too much cheese.  The atmosphere inside is light and relaxed, and it's got a nice trendy vibe.  They even have gelato here if you've got a sweet tooth after devouring some delicious pizza!  Give this place a look!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Pizza is baked in 2 minutes. Lots of gourmet options. The chicken alfredo pizza and cheesy bread were great!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the employees 1 star for the general manager Chris. Food was decent. But let me tell you about my experience. I was greeted by all the workers working the line. They were all super friendly and welcoming. Willing to take my order even though they were very busy. Chris yells that his employees should stop taking the customers orders and complete the ones in line. Which is not so understandable- I would say more teamwork is needed here. I could understand them splitting up and taking on new orders while the others worked on the old. Which is what the employees did. I really liked the service from J and Lindsey. Both very sweet and kind. Apologetic for their poor manager's behavior. He yelled repeatedly that they finish the orders already being done rather than starting on new orders and creating a line. I really think that is very poor customer service-- on the managers part. I feel pretty bad for the workers working there (who all had excellent customer service.) Coming back here is debatable."}
{"text":"Not sure if there was a glitch or what the issue was, but I used the app/website last night in hopes of providing dinner for a Monday Night Football crowd I was hosting, only to be disappointed when I arrived at the restaurant to find it wasn't even open! The hours are listed as 11:00am-9:00pm on Monday's and I received my order confirmation email well before 6:00pm. Oh well, maybe next time we are vacationing in Scottsdale we can try again! Might want to check your restaurant info so others aren't misled in the future."}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza for the price. It's almost like a subway where you you pick your toppings and watch them make it. The pizza comes out in what feels like 5 minutes which is so quick and perfect, because I am one of those hangry people. High quality and super fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"lots of options for their menu, very nice place to eat. but the reason this place didn't get 5 or even 4 stars is because our pizza was burnt. we have been here before and our pizza hasn't been this charred. also when recieving our salad, the waitress/worker/team member told us to go get forks all the way across the restaruant. I was a bit disappointed about that.   I don't think we will be coming here for pizza, there are plenty better places around the area."}
{"text":"After shopping at Costco (yes, that was the main reason), we needed something to eat, fast, and dropped into 1000 degrees.  It's a fast casual restaurant- you go in- order your pizza (from options or make your own), and then they make it right there and stick it in the stove. We decided on the meatza- it was made pretty quick and we sat down and started eating.  It's a thin crust pizza- but, as one who eats a lot of pizza, I didn't think there as anything all that special to it. Yeah, it's fast- yeah, it's got that charred taste as they have the special oven- but the sauce was meh, and the pizza was meh. I mean, we were hungry, so it satisfied us- but it wasn't to the level of Vero or other great pizza places in CLE. However, for a fast casual restaurant- it's decent.  I would probably come back here- however, not a place I would \"crave\" per se- more of a place where, given I need food and I need it fast- I would stop into here."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from here for the first time via Uber Eats. The driver brought me the wrong order, so I called to inform them so that they knew they would have to make the order I received again. Chris, the general manager went out of his way to deliver my pizza to my house himself AND gave me cheesy bread as well!  I was shocked that he did this because I could have come driven to pick it up. Also, everything that I received was delicious! The cheesy bread though... you can see the pieces of freshly chopped garlic on it. YUM.   Thank you Uber Eats for your inattentiveness, and I will definitely be visiting this place very soon!"}
{"text":"I have found a new favorite spot for wings! Fired in the oven instead of fried and it's only $20 for two dozen. The Dry rub and BBQ were insane. The oven makes the meat just fall off the bone and there are a bunch of amazing flavors (we tried four total).   The restaurant is simple, low key, and clean. Everyone was so nice and offered up some different flavor combinations for when we come back. They even serve Fresh Squeezed IPA which is my favorite. Prices were also surprising reasonable for everything so next time I'll definitely try the pizza.   FYI this is a build your own pizza place with all the ingredients visible so you can watch them bake your pie in the cool looking oven. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some great pros: the staff is super friendly and attentive, they have set menu items as well as the build your own option, and the space is overall open and clean.   You enter and order/build your pizza at the counter, then pay at the end of the counter. They give you a number and deliver your pizza to you when it's done. They have 10\" and 14\" sizes and the pricing is pretty reasonable. We didn't opt for build your own, and got a 10\" Margherita pizza and a 10\" Smokey pollo (chicken, bacon, bbq, onions, pineapple) pizza. The Margherita was $7.95 and the pollo was $8.95.   The Smokey pollo was pretty lackluster. I don't blame this on anyone working, it was just not the best flavor combo for what was a take on bbq chicken pizza. It tasted a little cheap to me, which was sad. I wanted to like this place a lot. It was still okay though.   I will say, the Margherita was much better. Still pretty average for this kind of place, but I definitely would order this or a simple pepperoni if I ever returned.   All in all, it's a fast, cheap spot to grab a custom pizza. I would come back if someone wanted to go, but wouldn't drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Unacceptable! What kind of pizza has pretty much no cheese?? Got the Margarita pizza like I usually do from this location but this time had basically little to none cheese! It was pretty much nothing but sauce and bread! No flavor, no cheese, and no customer service as well! I called the place to let them know but they were pretty much laughing on the phone. This will be my last time here!     Update: this place has great management,  they seen the review and reached out to us to try them again and to be honest We couldn't wait. They have a Great family vibe and really care about they're customers satisfaction.  We will definitely be back on the regular! Thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time. I was disappointed that the pizza is not cooked in a wood fire oven. They use an oven designed to look like a wood fire oven, but the pizza oven is heated by what looks like a blowtorch that blasts on when the oven is going to be used. I have to trust that the oven in fact does reach 1000 degrees before they put the pizza in. We had the 10\" Margarita Pizza. When we got our pizza I was surprised by its look. It looked very much like a wood fire Pizza. It just didn't have that wood fire taste with those yummy burnt parts. But once I got over the whole wood fire comparisons and just took it at it was I have to say it was a good pizza. The sauce was a little sweet, mozzarella was good and basil was fresh. The dough was thin and soft. I also ordered some wings. They initially came lukewarm which they fixed and gave me a ticket for a free pizza for the inconvenience. Can't ask for more than that. Overall this is a clean, friendly, place for some decent Neapolitan style pizza. I would recommend you come and try this place. They have a good variety of special pizzas, and you can build your own as well."}
{"text":"So.........I wanted to check out a new pizza place, and saw this spot on Yelp.  It wasn't too far from work, so I headed on down.  I walked in, and made my own pizza with meatballs, roasted garlic, onions and ricotta.  Here is what I liked about the place, and what I didn't like about the place.  Liked - Lots of toppings to choose from. - Price was decent (Just under $10.00). - Pretty cool you can get a Neapolitan pizza at a fast/casual type place...pretty rare. - Fast turnaround time between placing your order and having your pizza in front of you. - Visually appealing.  Didn't Like - Customer service.  I walked in and was greeted by a skinnier, brown haired dude.  Friendly as can be!  He was working alone though, making a few pizzas.  He called for help from the back 2 separate times before anyone came out.  The girl who made my pizza was pleasant enough, but just going through the motions.  The cashier was just meh.  She required assistance from other people on how to clear the screen from a previous order.  She apologized about the delay, but it was with a stone cold straight face and no emotion at all.  I'll chalk it up as her having a bad day.  Meh. - Topping sizes.  While they did have a bunch of toppings (in my like section above), the toppings were cut really small.  I prefer a larger/rougher chop. - Crust.  The crust looked great, had a nice char etc, but it was so plain.  No flavor at all.  - Napkins!  Yes, I am going to bitch about the napkins.  They look like they are \"earthy/recycled\" type napkins, and they were one ply.  They were the thinnest napkins I have ever seen.  I had to use at least 20 of them. I hate places that use cheap napkins.  Overall, the pizza was alright.  I really liked the ricotta, and the roasted garlic.  The meatballs, onions and cheese were just ok.  It wasn't bad, but I prefer other \"do it yourself type\" pizza joints.  Would I come back?  Eh....If I was in the area, maybe.  Am I specifically driving back here again?  No.  Cool concept, but nothing more than just A-OK.  Exactly what 3 stars is."}
{"text":"Well hello there hidden delicious pizza place! If we weren't in the plaza I would have never known this place was there, so imma try to spread the word... because this spot is so good!  We were greeted immediately and the young man at the counter told us how ordering worked. Great menu, lots to choose from and customize. They started making our pizzas and even though they weren't 'custom' they still asked 'is this enough cheese?' ' good on the bacon?'  I got the Quattro Formaggio and it was bomb. (Does that still mean cool?) the pizza was just how I like it- thin, sorta crispy and fresh toppings. Such flavorful sauce, a little on the sweet side but very authentic. I also got a salad and it was simple but freshly made and I loved the balsamic dressing!  A manager/ owner stopped by a few times to check on us. It was excellent service, even more excellent food and a nice clean store. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"A new twist on hot and ready, not five minutes after the pizza was placed in the 1000° oven--it was ready to come out and be eaten.    The variety of toppings and options provides for atmosphere where everyone can get what they want quickly and at a fair price"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of pizza places in the area we were in while visiting Scottsdale, we decided on 1000 Degrees. Great find! The gentleman helping us( perhaps he was the owner?), was so friendly and the rest of the staff was just as friendly and helpful. We ordered 2 of their large pizzas, one Tony Pepperoni, one White Out and one Classic Margherita, as well as a Caprese salad. We watched as the young man behind the counter meticulously put our salad together. He then mentioned to us that that was his favorite salad to make...and it showed! Well, our pizzas were ready in just minutes and the service couldn't have been better! Wish we had one of these where I live!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch experience yesterday at this restaurant. I love the idea of walking down the production line with the ability to customize my pie. The ingredients were awesome, flavor superb.  The place was extremely clean which is very important to me.  So while I will certainly be back for the food and will recommend to friends the reason I am posting this review is to point out what an amazing staff this establishment has. I misplaced my wallet after lunch and was certain that I had left it at the restaurant. I called and spoke to Chris who immediately offered to review the stores video to help me locate my wallet. I was in the area so I drove to the restaurant and everyone there stopped what they're doing to help me search. This included reviewing the store video, digging through the trash, and searching the parking lot! Unfreaking believable!    So amazing service and amazing food, who could want more?"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The place has a pieology-like setup, but I was happy that they had options like garlic and basil to put on your pizza. Pizzas are delicious, the wings are delicious, and everyone seems to be real happy with their jobs, which translates to happy and kind people behind the counter. Chris was super nice and helpful. He checked in with us at our table to make sure our food came out right, which is unheard of at a place of this style. There is no aspect of this place that was lacking. Definitely 5 stars, more if I could!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. GM was present the entire meal and made sure we were satisfied and taken care of at all times.  Food is reasonably priced and delicious. Wide variety of pizzas and salads. They offer beer and dessert as well. Staff was kind and quick. I will absolutely be coming back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"First time in but have been wanting to try and very glad my wife and I did. Pricing is crazy ... $9 for a 10\" however you want, thin crust, oven baked, and super fresh Ingredient awesome yumminess.   The store was super clean and all the little details like condiments filled . The GM Christopher took an interest with each customer and the house was about half full even though a 1/2 hour to close. Looking forward to going back to be sure!!"}
{"text":"What a nice and fun place to eat!  The pizza was really good, the staff friendly. Being from NY I'm always skeptical when getting pizza in AZ but was pleasantly surprised.    The owners daughter was helping her mom bus tables and the little girl even held the door for us on the way out. She was really cute as well as her mom!"}
{"text":"People were great - friendly, attentive. Place was clean. Loved how you can build your own and it's fast!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and breadsticks. Chris was our server and he was fantastic!! Very helpful with the menu on our first visit and helped make it a great experience for us. We visit the Mayo Clinic often and it is close so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't so impressed with this place.   I came with my 6yr old, who loves cheese pizza - nothing else on it, which is not too unusual for the kindergarten crowd.    The 10\" pizza for a cheese only seemed a bit small - even for him.  So, I got the 14\", which was $16.  This is really expensive in my opinion for a 14\" pizza - that was OK tasting.  I thought the crust was a bit too thick and not flavorful.   That said, a good variety of ingredients added may make it a lot better.   Just saying if you're going to get a cheese pizza for the kiddos, you could do better elsewhere.   I got one of the chicken salads - not bad and a good deal since you can add the pizza ingredients like a salad bar.   The quality of the chicken was not good though.  This is precooked/cut/cold/flavorless protein.   Again, probably better mixed into a hot pizza.     The staff was super friendly, so that is a plus.  Overall, with so many options for pizza and salad in the area...."}
{"text":"Love the personal size pizzas. We had take out and the pizzas stayed warm. The crust isn't too thick or thin; just right. It had perfect amount of chewiness to it as well.  Didn't know this but there's no need to order ahead for pick up as the pizzas are made so quickly. Tuscan pizza was tasty, better than the pepperoni. The prices are friendly as well."}
{"text":"If Yelp is teaching me anything, I eat out too much.  Had lunch here today.  I like that they have pizza, salads, and wings on the menu.  I'm a big pizza and wing fan.  Since this is my first time here I have to get the pizza and wings.  I'm pretty excited about this.   I ordered the 10 inch meatza neapolitan pizza.  Everyone working here is super nice.  Just want to throw that in there.  Anyway, I got the spicy sauce, spicy sausage, pepperoni, and bacon.  After I got my pizza I looked back at what the meatza had on it.  She forgot the meatballs.  Oh well.  The pizza itself was a thin type crust cooked in their 1000 degree oven.  Only issue here is the pizza got burned.  Cooking in that hot of an oven you run that risk.  I couldn't even eat the crust of the one piece.  I threw it out.  Look at the picture.  You can see the piece I'm talking about.   Otherwise, the pizza was tasty.  They cook the wings in the oven, too.  I ordered 6 wings with buffalo sauce.  The wings were very large.  After eating the wings I could only eat half the pizza.  Back to the wings.  They were sitting in sauce.  Had extra sauce on top by what looks like was added after they were cooked.  Bad move.  They were all rubbery.  I was really hoping that that hot of an oven would crisp them up.  Nope.  Nice and rubbery.  The food here has potential.  I think I like Pizza Fire better.  Next time I want 5 minute pizza that's where I'll go.  What I got and what I paid for was way too expensive for lunch.  For 1 person.  $8.95 for the pizza, $1.99 for a drink, and $5.99 for 6 wings.  My total was $18.28.  That's way too expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly cheesesteak pizza and a pepperoni pizza. Very good. There was a little too much charred crust to give the 5th star but would order from there again. We had it delivered by Uber Eats which was less than ideal as it took almost an hour but the pizza still tasted good."}
{"text":"I went for the gluten free pizza. Very disappointed! Udis frozen is waaaay better. The crust was so thin I couldn't even pick it up. Plus it really wasn't cooked(I mean heated, becuz it seems to be prepared ahead) enough...soggy. My husband had the Roman style, which he said was good. Not great, but good.  Also, the girl at the counter talked super fast explaining to us how it worked. Had I not read the article in Mimi's I would have no clue what she was saying. And, 1ast thing, every table was dirty! Every one. And it was a Sunday at 3:30. Not a busy time and at least 5 people working at that time.  Get a better gluten free crust, help over the age of 18 and I might go back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and excellent service. Great price for the pizza. Always have exceptional customer service and will go back there again."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for a week and wanted pizza in our condo for dinner. We looked on Yelp and found 1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria. We ordered online which was easy to do but did not see an option for requesting the time we wanted the pizza to be ready. Fortunately the timing worked out ok. We received a nice greeting from the staff when we arrived and when we got back \"home\" we enjoyed very much the pepperoni pizza. There was ample cheese, spices and pepperoni. The crust was very good as well. If we had one of these in Rhode Island we would frequent it."}
{"text":"Stopped in real quick while we were waiting on family.  My husband and I split the 16\" and kids got the personal size for them.  We got to choose from a variety of sauces and toppings. Nothing super fancy, but provided enough to choose from.  The best part was that the pizza is done blazing fast which is great when you have hungry kiddos.  The sauce could have used a bit more flavor, but the crust is really good.  Service was top notch!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Grand opening adventure went smoothly. Modern and colorful interior with bright and bold color schemes greeted all the first time guests. Super friendly employees worked hard to keep the long line moving. The food concept is like Chipotle and Piada. You pick the toppings and your meal is prepared fresh and fast. In this case super fast because they use a custom 1,000 degree oven. Your thin crust pizza is done in 2 minutes. My deluxe pizza was very good and hubby loved his buffalo chicken.  It was cool that all toppings are included for one price. I can see this restaurant being popular with teens and families as the prices were pretty inexpensive and super fast food."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about 1000 Degrees Pizza.  I am gluten intolerant, and that causes many issues when you are trying to eat out. I hate being an inconvenience to restaurants, but I also do not want to get sick.  I have now visited 1000 degrees three times. None of those times did I get sick. In fact the employees go above and beyond what I have ever seen. Each time, they got fresh toppings out from the fridge, went and got clean utensils, and cooked the pizza on a special tray in the big 1000 degree oven instead of just on the brick where other gluten pizzas have sat. It may take a few more minutes for the wonderful staff to pull new toppings out, but the risk of cross contamination is so much less. Plus, the pizza is FANTASTIC!!   Thank you 1000 Degrees for going above and beyond. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"For anyone going here for their first time it's important to note this restaurant is a \"fast casual\" situation, including their product and the atmosphere. If you're looking for a hand-tossed, \"just like mama used to make\" experience, direct your attention elsewhere. Now that the scene is set, I think you will NOT be disappointed in the least with what you get here.  I went for the first time last night with my wife to pick up two 12\" pies. Our goal was to feed a four person family. We were greeted by a helpful team member who explained the house specialties and ways to order custom. The wife and I chose one specialty and one custom pie; \"The White Out\" and then a meatball and pepperoni.  It wasn't too busy, so the GM Chris Peru was on the line helping the order. He pulled two pre-made, chilled pizza doughs from a fridge and started crafting. Some garlic-infused olive oil became the foundation of the White Out pie, and a few generous splashes of red sauce were laid down for the other one. By the time the pizzas hit their signature 1000-degree rotating oven, I barely had time to pay, sit down and start catching up with my wife about our day before the pies were done! Chris handed them over with a clever, harmless wisecrack about me looking like some celebrity and I could tell that he really liked his work and enjoys being around people.     We had a 10 minute ride home and on the drive, I remembered thinking to myself, \"how good are these REALLY going to be from a dough like that and with such a hustled cook time\". But after the first bite of the White Out, I was hooked. The dough was not too crisp, not too soft, and had just the right amount of loft to it. The ingredients weren't salty or over powered by the garlic, it was the perfect balance of flavors. The red pie was equally good. The sweet sausage and pepperoni quality was very nice, and didn't taste burnt or oily.    All in all, I think that the quality of the product you get here, combined with the fast service and casual but friendly experience justify the price. Our two 12\" pies were just shy of $38.00 with tax included. Unless you trade down to a Papa Johns / Dominoes, you're going to have a hard time getting something to this standard."}
{"text":"Can pick their version of build your own for a dollar more--love how fresh everything is!  I get the Meatzza and add mushrooms and roasted garlic with extra cheese.  Philly style is great, as well as the White Out pizzas."}
{"text":"Good Pizza. Fast and friendly service. I like the slightly thicker crust than most other pizza places like this. Thanks and well done!"}
{"text":"Love the place. I am picky about my pizza crust. They have a nice chewy crust. And all the topping you would want on a pizza. And under 2 minutes to cook it's a fast option when working in the mall."}
{"text":"First time customer and I must say, for an \"assembly line\" (build-your-own)  pizza parlor - really not too bad!  Had a 14\" \"Meatza\" pie and the crust was very bubbly and just a little charred (which is good).  14\" pie was enough to eat with three slices for take home.  Cabrese salad was very large - took half home.  Probably will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ever time I come in I'm greeted instantly. I've tried many of their pizzas and they are all amazing. My favorite is the Mac and cheese. I don't think I've ever waited more than 5 minutes for my pizza. An oven at 1,000 degrees that is crazy! Every employee is amazing and super friendly. I would highly recommend this to everyone! Plus ordering online is a breeze and great if you are in a time crunch too. I will be definitely be come back to this place time and time again"}
