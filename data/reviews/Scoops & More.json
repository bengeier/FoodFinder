{"text":"What a cute little place for a cone and a burger!  It looks like an old diner with a few seats inside and ample seating outside.    We stopped for ice cream after a run at Robinson.  They have soft serve and hard scoop!    No 5 because the service seemed unnecessarily slow."}
{"text":"Great food wife had pizza and liked it I had a gyro. They got busy but not too bad. Girls up front need a bit more of a system to make service faster but they seemed new."}
{"text":"Very good place for a simple meal, especially Pizzas. The new owner renovated an old and dingy place into a clean, old school looking pizza and ice cream shop with a modern twist. We went there twice so far and will be happy to go back.  We tried a few things on the menu: Philly cheesesteak hoagie sandwich: not overly greasy, every bite has a nice mix of meat, onion and grilled peppers.  Basic cheese burger: good beefy flavor, though a little greasy. Pork Souvlaki Salad: love the seasonings but the cut of meat they used was extremely chewy, probably will not order it again. Hot wings: nice heat, not too greasy, the blue cheese dressing that comes with them is also very good. Greek Pizza: exceptional!  The gyro meat was nicely seasoned, garlic sauce is heaven for garlic lovers, most importantly, the pizza crust is not too thin or thick, crunchy and airy with a chewy center. Will definitely go back to try their other Pizzas. Not a fancy place but if you happened to be in the neighborhood, give this place a try. Service is very friendly and they deliver within 5 miles."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed our experience. I had a gyro and she a had a cheeseburger. They gyro was very good. The chips that came with it were seasoned with some sort of herb salt which was very good. The prices seemed a little high, but when we got our food and saw that the portions were a good size the price seemed fair. We got soft serve ice cream to go. The soft serve was what you'd expect. The next time we go we want to try other flavored. The staff was friendly and accommodating even though they were very busy. Great little place!"}
{"text":"Great service. Made a delivery order. Due to an issue with the delivery person the manager brought it.  Food was excellent. Based on another review I ordered the gyro sandwich. Great choice. Not sure when I might ever be back in Pittsburgh, so I am glad I was able order food from Scoops and more."}
{"text":"Great new place. Love the Greek pizza! We also had a chicken salad with fresh grilled chicken and fresh cut fries. All were great! We will be back."}
{"text":"Stop in for lunch with a group of 8 people. The service exceeded our expectations. The young ladies that served us was extremely pleasant.  By the way the food is delicious. We are back tonight for seconds."}
{"text":"A great little diner! The staff is friendly and the food is great and reasonably priced.  The interior is bright, clean and modern. My family and I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ice cream! The girls inside were very nice, and made suggestions for flavors. I used to go here when I was younger. Still love it now!"}
{"text":"Best Ice Cream I have had in a long time, very good service. Why only three stars? We tried the sandwiches I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak but asked as the menu says to substitute Grilled Chicken, sandwich came and had steak I decided to try it anyway, it was dripping with grease, the bottom bun was saturated with it. We ordered a kids hot dog for one of the grandkids and it was charred.  Wife ordered a cheeseburger and it was overly done and dried out. Bottom line go for Ice Cream and skip the food! Can't speak to the pizza as we will not order food there again."}
{"text":"First time here and I only live two miles away! I got just simply a small cone with sprinkles which was good! I also got an order of 6 hot garlic Parmesan wings, and to be honest I didn't like them at all. My friends agree. I didn't think the sauce (maybe just mine in particular) had any flavor to it. I wouldn't order again, but everything else looked great!!! Not the cheapest but I have heard their portions are very generous. I will for sure be back in the near future. I feel bad even stating a negative because it's so cute, the employees are nice, and they have a wide variety. With that being said, don't judge this place just because I didn't like the wings because they have plenty other options to offer. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review before but Scoops has really gone downhill since they opened. We have gotten mushy pizza, burnt pizza, horrible fish sandwiches, mushy fries, and burnt tasteless wings lately. It's sad because my family used to really love their food so we keep ordering thinking the bad food is a fluke but after today we will not be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!  Food is awesome, especially the gyros.  Ice cream is to die for. I had the baklava sundae.  Can't believe they make that.   Great service, super friendly staff, and reasonable prices.  I go to Scoops every chance I get!  The secret is getting out!!  Everyone loves this place!"}
{"text":"They have the greatest ice cream and nicest people. I can't wait for them to open again for the season. I live right down the street and I go everyday to get a soft serve before I get home."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! I appreciated the warm and welcoming service that I experienced in this diner style restaurant. Their selection is massive and reasonably priced! My recommendation? Leave room for desert! You cannot escape without trying some creamery items that are available year round!"}
{"text":"We were in Robinson & craving some ice cream. I did a quick yelp search & came across Scoops & More.   We were here within minutes. Its in a totally random spot, but its well lit so you know you found the right spot! They have a decent parking lot. Inside there are a few booths and some counter seating.   Their menu consists of hot foods (think pizza shop... Hoagies, pizzas, sandwiches, wings etc) and ice cream. They sell soft serve chocolate, vanilla & twist plus Hershey's ice cream with plenty of variety.   Bobby ordered a brownie sundae with specialty Hershey's sundae. I ordered a banana split with regular soft serve ice cream. We enjoyed our ice cream and the adorable little shop. Service was friendly & they took debit cards.   I can't comment on the food but we were surprised & satisfied with our ice cream treats."}
{"text":"Crazy little dessert place in the middle of nowhere that serves up a lot more than just dessert.  If Hubs and I hadn't already eaten elsewhere, we might have taken a chance on the food here, but as it was, all we wanted was some good ice cream.  And this tiny little restaurant served up just that.  Counter personnel were nice.  They seemed like high school kids doing a \"first\" job, but they were pleasant enough and efficient.  Sundaes were perfect and hit the spot.  It wasn't overly busy when we were there (weekend night about an hour before closing), but people were coming in and out on a regular basis, so it's pretty obvious that this place is getting \"known\".  I wouldn't have expected such goodness in what looks like an abandoned little town (really, we would have never found it without directions), but more fools us!  When we come back to the P'burgh, we'll definitely stop in again and try the food next time.  Very impressive."}
{"text":"Stopped here due to a car breakdown.  During our 2 hour wait for a tow, the staff was so kind and helpful. Offered water and for us to sit inside because of the heat.    We sat to the greeting of three of their staff all cheery and nice!     The menu was completely unexpected!   From Gyros, to Pizza, a full and complete offering!   Did I mention huge selection of ice cream?   Soft and hard were both available!   We had a gyro and ice cream!   Excellent food,  the dessert was perfect, the service was even better.  Outdoor covered patio adds an amazing view and atmosphere to the place.    You have to stop by here if you are local or not!  Right off the highway and convenient return!  Make the trip!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight for ice cream! I live less than 5 minutes away so I will be returning to try their food and of course get more ice cream!  Very nice staff"}
{"text":"Excellent food with decent prices. Portions are  big.  Their fries are delicious.    I would recommend the gyros,  Greek salad,  and the wings!"}
{"text":"I found Scoops & More through GrubHub on my phone. I tried them on a whim at work. They always have fast and friendly delivery with fair prices for food that is pretty average.   I would love to see the food quality improve but you can't beat the great prices, and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome little place that's more than ice cream! Omg the burgers, gyros, pizza, I gained a ton of weight since I figured out this place has a 5 mile delivery range, def check them out!"}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill since they first opened, on 3 occasions I've ordered pizza with light sauce and it had so much sauce it was goopy. I've ordered a few other things that have been \"meh\", nothing special for the price. Except the greek fries....I will still get their greek fries. Location is great for me and the ice cream is great. Staff is always very friendly.  They need to step their food game back up."}
