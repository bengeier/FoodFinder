{"text":"Fancy tacos done right!!!! We ordered the following to share:  - Fried cauliflower taco (amazing - prob my favorite) - Carne Asada taco (delicious, a little spicy but good!) - Pork Belly taco (my husband loved it, I'm not a huge pork belly fan but I still devoured half of it!) - Chicken burrito (SO GOOD - would never think to order a chicken burrito but this will be my meal of choice when I return!)  We also did the rice and beans and corn side dishes, licked both plates clean!   The ambiance is very cool, small and quaint but with a big-city feel. We brought our (slightly destructive) baby, it was very child friendly and had the most adorable kids menu I've ever seen!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"you cant go wrong with this place.. for less than 10 bucks you got soup, drink n the entree  they serve great Hong Kong style (cha chaan teng) westernized food"}
{"text":"I feel that this place is very underrated in the Spadina Chinatown area.  The fact that it's hidden in a corner in the Dragon City mall, and has few prominent signs out front (drowned out by signs from other restaurants like Owl of Minerva, Yooj Express, and Sky Dragon), means that Canteen is not easy to find.  However, take the time to go up to the second floor, and you'll find Canteen to be a far superior alternative to the Chinese-style fast food offered by Yooj Express.  Canteen serves what's called \"Hong Kong Steakhouse\" food.  Places like these usually include menu items such as noodles and rice as well as Western fare such as steaks, grilled fish, sizzling dishes and so on.  For some strange reason, this kind of food is neither very abundant nor very good in Toronto's Chinatown.  This type of restaurant is very popular with Chinese people, especially people from Hong Kong, in the tradition of Cafe de Coral, because of large portions, variety of food and reasonable prices.  I've had a few bad experiences trying out this style of food in the Spadina area (several spots along Dundas St. serve this food, but they are pretty pathetic, and I'm not going back).  Canteen is the one that passes the grade.  I usually order something simple such as the Pepper and Salt Pork Chops with rice.  They make a pretty good Ox Tongue in White Sauce (a very hit-or-miss dish, usually), and their Sweet and Sour beef is good.  For larger dishes they have a really great sole fish/chicken steak combo, and you can get some very delicious fried rice to go with it.  With your soup comes some simple yet great garlic toast.  And their iced milk tea is well above average.  I wish Canteen would improve its decor a bit, because it's quite dark, a bit cramped, and adding to its somewhat hidden location, it just doesn't catch the eye.  But give it a chance and you'll find it to be quite a good contender in the area for fast, uncomplicated, reliable food."}
{"text":"the food, service and prices all excellent. The only thing I was disappointed about the selection of hot sauce. I had the carnitas tacos and a couple beers."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my wife, first ones in the restaurant on a cold Saturday noon. The host was very friendly and welcomed us in, the margaritas are very good, lime juice and very well crafted. Their salsa is great order the green one, and chips fresh. This is a street taco place that is high end (except the price) and very good. I recommend multiple visits to try them all. Excellent value and great food and drink."}
{"text":"Food is superb, drink selections are even better. My only critique is for the hosts. We were told a 30 minute wait, so we put our name in and walked to a nearby bar for a drink to pass the time. We then got a text notification just after ordering a drink stating we had to be back there in just ten minutes, or they wouldn't hold our table. I suggest 1) better training for the hosts on wait times or 2) a reasonable amount of time to claim your table once ready.   Other than that hiccup, everything was great!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Crossfit Games and found this place by chance. SO glad we did! The menu is unique and prices are so affordable. I ordered the cauliflower tacos and they were some of the best things I've ever eaten. I can't wait to come back next year!"}
{"text":"GET. THE. STREET. CORN. Absolutely awesome. As we're the Calbacita & Green Chili Chicken Tacos. (Emphasis on the Calbacita Taco.) We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Nice small place, cute atmosphere with a varied and fun menu.  Lot of individual items, so its easy to experiment.  The Beans and Crispy rice were amazing.  Can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"I went in to canteen on hearing they served hainan chicken rice. I placed my order and during the wait read through the yelp reviews to see what else on the menu might be worth a try, and ended up reading the review about finding a roach in the food... now I don't know if it was that review, or if it was just the food itself, but by the time I was eating the food I felt gaggy and couldn't really enjoy/finish the food. Also, when being served the food, I asked the waitress for the accompanying soup that goes with hainan chicken rice, and was told \"no, we don't serve soup with it\"... okay, didn't really fault them for it if that's how they served it... but after I paid at the counter and was walking out, saw another couple eating hainan chicken rice AND THEIRS CAME WITH SOUP. Whatever, at this point I'd already decided that Canteen wasn't worth a second try based on their sub-par chicken rice, seeing that the waitress jipped me out of a soup just sealed the deal."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we needed to have a late lunch. All of the tacos were spectacular and you can't miss the street corn! The crispy rice was a bit odd, but the flavor was yummy. Wish we had this restaurant at home!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I had three Tacos and all of them were incredible, but my favorite was the Green Chile Chicken (or something like that). Oh correction: my favorite was the Choco Taco!!! Yes, they have Choco Tacos for dessert and they're quite something."}
{"text":"I've passed by this dining spot for many times but haven't tried it until today.  It's located inside the well known Chinatown building Dragon Plaza.  It surely draws comparison to New Hong Kong bistro as both offer Hong Kong style Cafe food.  Upon browsing through their menu I realized that they offer same lunch special everyday.  Ordered steak with tiger shrimp lunch which includes soup and drinks.  I wouldn't say I like the soup as I prefer Chinese broth over westernized soup, but nice gesture for providing two small pieces of garlic bread.  As for the main dish, surprisingly it was executed nicely.  Steak was prepared and cooked perfectly.  It is tender and juicy.  I think they also sear the corner to give smokiness of the steak.  Shrimp tastes frozen but I think it is the same case for majority of spots Chinatown.  I think their sauce is milder than New Hong Kong bistro so would be ideal for those who prefer lighter taste.  As for the milk tea, it is not as dense as New Hong Kong bistro and I personally would prefer denser taste.  Overall I think it is a good alternative to New Hong Kong Bistro as sometimes I don't like their daily lunch special.  Overall, I will definitely visit again to try out other items."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. The Paloma was wonderful and refreshing, the tacos amazing, and the service outstanding. I got the braised squash and tomatillo tacos and it was outstanding. The"}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas! The \"el jeffe\" is worth the upgrade.  Staff is really nice.  Try the mezcal flight!"}
{"text":"Found a massive bug bout the size of your thumb.. with long legs and wings / roach in my soup of the day. I told the waitress and she tried to play it off and tell me it was an onion. Yeaaaaa.... probabaly not comming back here again."}
{"text":"Ugh!  Sadly, I am too old for this trendy place.  It is FREAKING loud.  After a half-hour wait for table on a Tuesday at 6:00, we were extremely bum-rushed because we weren't partaking in tequila that day.  (Hmm, circuitous route due to all of the construction on the Square + 30 minute wait + 20 minutes at table + 4 tacos + $22 gone = bad math).  Do not bother with the pork belly; it was such a sad little taco.  My ears are still ringing from the decibel level.  (Much prefer Tex Tubb's on the East Side; clearly I am not foe-Food Fight!)"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to try a new place while we were visiting Toronto and found the Canteen. Looking at the menu, it seemed like they had just about everything, and so as soon as we could get seats, we sat down.  As starters we ordered calamari, escargots, and the buttered garlic shrimp, all three of which were absolutely delicious, however the main courses were less than impressive. My one vegetarian friend ordered noodles and vegetables, and instead he had all sorts of meat in it, and they charged us for something completely different. My other friend had the seafood platter which was okay, and I had the fettucine pasta with..something. it was gross. The meat tasted like what I'd imagine dehydrated fungus would, the pasta was rubbery, and overall I just didn't eat. I also had a mango smoothie, with was filled with my ice chunks than smoothie, but unfortunately I left the restaurant still hungry. I got a hotdog from one of the stands at the corner of Spadina."}
{"text":"Can't fathom the hype! I love Food Fight restaurants but this one just does not live up to the label.  Let me provide some much-needed menu translations:  Mimosa = a tequila sunrise with some extra ingredients (none of which are champagne). Ask for a champagne mimosa and--if they have champagne at all--they'll charge you full price for the tequila cocktail.   Street corn = canned corn with some cheese sauce on top  Griddled burrito = just rice n' meat in a tortilla   There's nothing going on here that isn't going on in my microwave at 4am on a Saturday. Except for the bill.   I recommend checking out Bel Air Cantina for better food and a smaller price (especially during happy hour on Tuesdays)."}
{"text":"Took 55+ minutes for food to arrive after ordering.  Had to wolf it down to make show time.  I think it was good -- I had a belly ache for the play because I had to eat my food so fast.  If you have show tickets and are time conscious avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Just expected more from the space that housed Nostrano (and for how long this place took to open) than a semi-upscale fast-casual taco restaurant. The cocktails were very good (margaritas are always a good choice) and the bartenders serve them up quick. However, the food is pretty hit or miss. I've been here twice now and I'd guess half of the tacos I had were excellent and the other half were dry and lacked any flavor. The same with other entrées and sides I tried. It feels a little too casual for the space they occupy, too. Overall, a decent addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We ate at Canteen late-ish on a Friday night. Walked in and were promptly greeted by the host and told that there would be a 20 minute wait. We waited at the bar and had one of their delicious specialty margaritas, only to be told shortly that the group in front of us had cancelled and that we would be seated shortly. The rest of our party that had left to go to another bar joined us in our booth at the back of the restaurant.   Our server found us and dropped off Duritos..a kind of house made alternative to tortilla chips. We immediately placed an order for guacamole and escabeche which were delicious and authentic. After our round of drinks we ordered dinner, I had the house nachos and tacked on an order of the street corn, the others an array of tacos, burritos and enchiladas.   The food was slow to come out..probably 30-35 minutes which for the time of night and the amount of tables they had was probably a little too long. The food also came out sporadically like there may have been a disconnect between the wait staff and kitchen. My nachos were cold when they arrived so I sent them back for a quick warm-up, and when they arrived back at the table at least one person of party still hadn't gotten their food. The food itself was passable (the street corn was definitely a highlight!) but not the inventive/out-of-the-ordinary cuisine that was advertised on the menu. Was much closer to your run of the mill gringo Mexican food joint regarding the food than we had hoped for.  Atmosphere - lively, nicely decorated and comfortable   Service - very good, timely and friendly all the way around   Food - definitely something to be desired but not bad. It seemed as though all the other pieces are in place for this spot to be great but the food is holding it back some  Would definitely return for drinks and apps/lighter fare!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good service and location. The food was okay not great.   Churros were awesome, the tacos were okay. Expect to spend ~$35 for a dinnner for two. Overall a good place to have dinner with friends."}
{"text":"The tacos were mediocre, street corn wasn't great, and they screwed up our order, although they were nice about fixing it. My biggest problem here is with an extremely rude, unprofessional staff member. I went in to this restaurant with my boyfriend, and a woman who had just finished her shift sat down next to him and proceeded to blatantly hit on him as if I wasn't even there, although it was very clear that we were there together. It made it very difficult to enjoy my date with my boyfriend when there was a staff member who continued to rudely interject herself into our conversation and flirt with him. As we were leaving I told her that I didn't appreciate her hitting on my boyfriend the entire time and she insulted me. I am appalled that a staff member thinks it's ok to hit on customers who are out on a date and then insults them afterwards... I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Canteen took over the location of Nostrano and therefore had big shoes to fill. They are a new Mexican style restaurant and are a part of the bigger Food Fight restaurant company, serving trendy, flavorful tacos, tortas, burritos, etc. They have a few unique options that may be difficult to find in Madison like street corn and churros.  I've been here a few times now and I leave satisfied every time. The interior is colorful, lively, and awkwardly shaped. Food is a simple combination of complex flavors and textures,  leading to a great tasting experience.   Mistakes that should not be dismissed, however, are apparent. For example, every time I come, some of the meats aren't properly heated. I highlight the word heated,  as it is clear some of the filling are cooked in advance and then refrigerated. Bottom line is the center of the meat shouldn't be cold still. The second time I came in, Canteen ran out of Horchata. On the most recent visit, they no longer had churros for the evening. It's not like I am coming in at 11 pm; these foods that are out of stock are during reasonable hours.  Service seems to be quite variable based on who you get; some people are overly courteous where as others barely do the job to earn their dollar. Finally mistakes have been made on multiple  carry out orders where luckily I catch the mistake before leaving the restaurant. It is details like these that sort out mediocre from excellent, and things that should not be an issue months into being open, especially for a restaurant in a prime spot around the square.  Overall a great place that I would give four stars if there was consistency across the breadth of experiences."}
{"text":"Tacos. That's all. THEY ARE DELICIOUS...oh and the guacamole and salsa are both good, too. I've been here for lunch and dinner and they have brunch, too. My favorite things on the menu are their al pastor and pork belly tacos and the beans with crispy rice. You can't really go wrong with Canteen."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant downtown and i was very excited to try it out. The margaritas i had were delicious but beware they are not your typical drink. They are freshly made and very flavorful. The food was great! The place is a bit small so expect a wait during busy hours. They do have a bar you can wait at and the bartenders are great about getting you drinks! I will definitely be back to try the rest of the margaritas and food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and haven't been impressed either time. The most recent time was pretty bad, and I would rate the service one star. Our server was MIA for our entire visit. Neither of us got refills on our drinks, she didn't check on us after the food was delivered, and we had to flag her down for the check.  We ordered nachos and they came out dry, with my 6 black beans (I'm not exaggerating),a tablespoon of beef, and a tablespoon of guacamole on a huge pile of oily tortilla chips. $12 for 6 black beans and enough guacamole for 4 chips...so we flagged down the server and asked if they no longer put queso on the chips. She just looked at us. Awkwardly. For a good 10 seconds. I asked again. She pointed to a corner of the plate and said, \"there is a little bit right there\" and awkwardly looked at us again. I asked for more on the side and she brought it. It was one of the strangest interactions I've ever had with a server.  Our tacos came out and they were mediocre. Nothing that we can't make ourselves at home, and honestly, I wish I did just make them at home.  I'll skip Canteen and head to Tex Tubbs next time."}
{"text":"This review is just for Canteen's happy hour - apart from the complimentary duritos that they serve, I've not had their food.   My coworker and I have been steadily working our way through different happy hours in the Madison area and Canteen has become a favorite of ours because of the strong half-priced margs they serve. Their house marg is 7 bucks usually so during happy hour it's a dangerous $3.5!! The first time we stopped in, we were greeted by the manager. It was pretty empty when we walked in at 3 and the manager was very friendly and nice and made pleasant small talk with us - not the kind that you're trying to get out of but the kind that you don't mind because the person you're talking to is so nice! He brought us our bag of duritos promptly, explained their origin, and when we ordered our drinks, he was sure to ask if we wanted salt on the rim. I got the strawberry margarita and my friend got the house margarita and we were both very pleased with our drinks - they came out promptly and were tasty and strong.   The second time, we were greeted not by the manager but another worker and our service was a little less excellent. We ordered the same thing but he didn't bring out duritos - we had to ask - and my friend's drink came with salt on the rim, which she did not want. Pretty minor things but it made us miss the manager! Also, we were a little confused because he put the duritos on the bill, even though the menu states that the first bag is free. It's only a dollar so we didn't bring it up but it was just a bit inconsistent with the service we'd previously received. We'll still be back though because they have good margs and the happy hour drinks deal is super solid."}
{"text":"Yes I like this place. There margaritas are for real none of this play stuff. It was half price happy hour on them on a Saturday! We also had an early dinner with house made Doritas ,they tasted like porkies with a corn after taste, first one free and each additional one buck! The menu wasn't to large and our waitress Rosalind was very nice with advise on her favorites which made ordering easy! A nice place to return to!!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos,  delicious sides, everything tasted really fresh. I had the frozen strawberry margarita and my husband had the house margarita, both were excellent. Portions are a tad on the small side for the price, but the quality was really good. It was about a ten minute wait at 7pm on a Saturday. Prompt service, clean bathrooms. My only negative was that it was pretty loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding, adventurous Mexican food at really affordable prices. Great vegetarian options. Unusually good selection of tequila & mezcal."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my original review, I've been back to Canteen a few times. I've never had to wait for a table, which makes it more of a go-to spot for me. My boyfriend and I like to get late dinner here before going out to the bars. The service can be hit-or-miss but generally good.  The \"Duritos\" get better each time I go, with a little more flavor, but I still find it to be a weird choice and prefer their chips and salsa (which, I found out, you can order even though it's not on the menu!)  The tacos continue to be decent and filling. I never need more than one margarita to get buzzed.  If I could bump up my review a half a star, I might do so. The interior is very intimate and casual."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was very good. I especially loved their habanero mango salsa concoction, fresh guacamole, and their cute little house-made snack chips."}
{"text":"Love this authentic Mexican restaurant, staff and the food!  Brought me back to Puerto Vallarta because of their cold brewed Mexican Hortiata coffee and the music!  Came to find out later that they have happy hour too!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Canteen on their opening week. The environment was warm and friendly. Air plants on the wall were very cool. Service was great.Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable the about the menu.   The duritios are an interesting twist. Pretty tasty but I would still opt for traditional chips and salsa over them.   Tacos were the best part of the meal (duh). Had to lower my review because the rice and beans were horrible. I've never felt so strongly about a side before. the \"crunchy\" rice gets stuck in your teeth and I didn't like the garbanzo beans. Guess I just prefer traditional rice and beans with my tacos.   Tacos 4, atmosphere 4.5, rice and beans 0."}
{"text":"The best. My dad who is super skeptical of anything new and downtown said it was one of the best restaurants he has been to in a while. He appreciates the stemless wine glasses, great tacos, and a fun atmosphere. He actually arrived 30 minutes before us and was having the time of his life with the bartenders - definitely a place to take skeptics and people who want to have a fun time."}
{"text":"Had been here once before with a party of three and really enjoyed it. So I tried to make a reservation a week in advance for my birthday, a party of 7. When I called, I was informed that they don't take reservations, but as soon as one member of the party showed up, we could get on the list. Okay great!   Showed up last night, a rainy Wednesday, a half hour early and was told by the hostess that they couldn't really accommodate 7 people. This would have been helpful information to have been told during my original phone call - I had told the person on the other end of the line that we were a party of 7. Wtf.   The hostess thought she could squeeze us into a booth in the back and that it would be about an hour. She suggested we take a walk while we wait (in the rain?) as she could text me when our table was ready.   Went over to Genna's. No text after an hour so we went back - turns out that one person couldn't make it so we were now a party of six and she squeezed us into an open table.   Ordered the Guac - it was awesome but $7 for the smallest bag of chips I've ever seen.   There are some things on the menu mistakenly labeled as vegan that the waitress said couldn't be made vegan. There are also some vegetarian items that \"have the cheese already mixed in\" so they couldn't be made vegan either. The four vegans in our group all got the same taco. A good taco but it would be nice if the menu was more accurate.   Great margs but probably won't be back. Can't wait til Bel Air finally opens."}
{"text":"This was a fun spot to swing in and have a margarita. It was a Friday night, but it wasn't too busy inside and we got a couple spots at the bar.   Good margaritas!   We tried a few snacks. The Doritos that are complimentary (put some Valentina on these!) are fun and good. The green enchiladas were tasty. The highlight of the stop was the house-made choco taco. So good!!   Al in all it was a good stop. We went the next day for brunch! It was pretty empty, but still had a nice burrito and breakfast tacos. Not authentic, but fun!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Food Fight for putting a reasonably priced OUTSTANDING restaurant on The Square.  Guac is great, although maybe just a little bland.  Street corn is amazing.  Barbacoa tacos are awesome.  Homemade chips.  Great house margaritas.  Friendly and excellent service at bar and at tables.  Well done!!! Oh, and to nail it when just opening is pretty impressive too!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today (around noon on a Farmer's Market Saturday), and the wait time wasn't half bad. The three of us got drinks while waiting - have to praise their citrusy smooth take on the Oaxacan Old Fashioned.   It was a bit of a mystery how folks that sat after us got food delivered first. Almost had to run back to the parking meter to refill as we were there for over an hour before any food came to our table.  My friend ordered tacos to go, which we assumed would come out after -- they were somehow delivered 10 minutes before the rest of the food. My plate was also accidentally given to my friend (staff misspoke on what was on the plate when delivered), but the bite of her Carnitas taco was a great sample before we realized the switch.   A solid 'A' on the food front. The Barbacoa Beef Brisket taco was savory and well done. The seeds and watercress in the Calabacitas taco gave it a delightful crunch.   Sorry to food pics - was too hungry to wait to eat.   Perhaps it was an understaffed day? I'm hoping turnaround is typically quicker and more organized than we experienced."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. Nice size portions, good food, and it's pretty cheap, too! This place also has really nice decor! Only complaint: those \"doritos\" appetizers really aren't that great. I would prefer normal chips."}
{"text":"Good establishment, clean, and good service but the food lacked depth of flavor other than the mango salsa.  The food was a bit heavy on grease But the margaritas were great.  They also were good at suggesting a drink which is always a sign for service.    The wait was short which was nice even when the place was full.  Short wait for food which was also nice considering we had to get to a concert after dinner.  We ordered 2 side dishes.....crunchy rice dish which was ok but again but greasy.  The corn dish was underwhelming.  Corn was not fresh.  We had 6 different tacos.  The carnitas, fish, and pork belly were good.  The carni asada, chicken, and barbacoa were all chewy and not flavored well.    We also had guacamole for app which was good and the Doritos were good.  Wouldn't take much to turn this into a great place to eat and hang out.  Also heard a patio is potentially coming soon which would make this a margarita stopover for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Ok So I ordered from EatStreet tonight. Therefore, temperature, plating, etc aren't things I'll base this on. Not even estimated order delivery time (which was short of the expectation).  I ordered street corn, crispy rice and beans, two barbacoa tacos (no cilantro), beef burrito no cilantro, and duritos. I'll start with the app/sides:  Duritos:  Delicious blend of seasonings. I'd eat these again every time. The thing that sort of gets me is this: for a $0.69 bag of dehydrated wagon wheels, you charge people who want it for delivery $1.00. And you give them about 9. I get that you give this away in-store. But if I don't want to dine-in, you're charging me, and then making me feel nickel-and-dimed. Why? 3/5  Street corn:  People have alternately loved and hated on this for some reason on yelp. This is a 5 star item. Even delivered, I loved it and wished I'd subbed another portion for the crispy rice and beans. Perfection in cheese, lime, seasoning, and temperature. I don't give a rip if it is frozen corn, I'd eat this every day. If you want a fresh corn dish, go to Nomo. 5/5  Crispy Rice and Beans:  I know, I know. read the menu. I did. And I still gave it a chance. The LAST thing I want in rice in beans, is a crunch. I give this dish a -5/5. My dog ate it, though, so that's a plus. Due to reading and not comprehending, i'll just go for 0/5  Barbacoa tacos:  Super underwhelming. The barbacoa itself was tasty. There's nothing else memorable about it. So much potential for these $4 tacos, and you're just disappointing. 2/5  Burrito with beef:  Hot, generally delicious. But all you do is cram a bunch of rice into a burrito with a bit of cheese, a marginal amount of meat, and then refried black beans. I like ALL of those things, but you aren't doing anything new. If i'm being honest, the money spent on this, is better spent at Burrito Drive. They've got inventive and delicious burritos. 1.5/5   All in all, I'd try this place again. I'd go here to see what their service and drinks are like. The food in a vaccuum is hit or miss. The street corn, in my estimation, shines. And the barbacoa in and of itself is top notch. They just need to capitalize on what they have. Probably won't re-order delivery, possibly will try to stop in.  So, all in all, its a 46%. Which is slightly higher than two stars. But I don't have fractionals, so 2 it is. Hope they can get better, they have potential just based on food. I'll update if/when I visit in person."}
{"text":"Right in the most recognizable building in Chinatown (always being shown on TV), the Dragon City, it's Can*Teen.  Canteen :  a restaurant attached to a factory, school, etc., providing meals for large numbers of people (reference:the free dictionary http://www.tfd.com/canteen)  they serves great Hong Kong style westernized food, and with few other Asian signature dishes.  they have a rotating list of lunch specials, with the Steak always on it, and for only $10.99,  it's a great deal. (Lunch special comes with a soup and a coffee or tea)  My favorites are the Hainan Chicken Rice, Cutlet Pork Chops, Cutlet fish... (the list goes on and on...)  advise: please call ahead to order, as wait time could be long if they are busy.  2/15"}
{"text":"I loved Nostrano and was sad to see it close. I was intrigued when I saw that Canteen, a taqueria and tequila bar would be taking over its spot. When we walked by and I saw it was open, we had to stop and try it. The space it not very big, but the decor is festive and bright and you kind of feel like you're at a party. We had to wait about five minutes while they cleared a table, but I think we were lucky to get in that quickly.  Our waiter was very enthusiastic about the menu and the restaurant. He was happy to share recommendations. Instead of chips and salsa, they start you with a little bag of duritos. These are little wagon-wheeled shaped puffed pieces. They have a yummy chili and lime seasoning but I don't care for the Cheetos like texture.  I love the menu because it was not the run-of-the-mill standard Mexican. Dishes like jicama salad, ceviche, and sweet potato dorados make it stand out. We ordered the enchiladas, griddled burrito, and fried cauliflower tacos. The sauces on the burrito and enchilada were amazing - fresh, pungent, tasty. The flavors in my burrito were delicious. We were all very pleased w/the tastes and textures of our dishes.  Fantastic service, great food, fun atmosphere. Canteen makes me just as happy as Nostrano did. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great, new restaurant. I ended up here after most places were closed Sunday night and was not disappointed. It was happy hour so I opted to try a half price margarita which was fantastic - not too sweet like most places. A bag of duritos is a must, first one is free. I could best deaceibe them as Mexican funions.   There are plenty of vegetarian options, I opted for the cauliflower taco which was phenomenal. I tried the crispy rice and beans as a side and that was decisions as well though a tad spicy. Another person in my group got the street corn which was a tasty blend of corn, cotija cheese and some kind of chipotle sauce.   Super friendly staff, great food, awesome happy hour. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Canteen has quickly become one of my go to happy hour spots on the square. Not many restaurants have an EVERYDAY 2pm-5pm happy hour. Their house lime margaritas are originally priced at $7, but during happy hour they are half off leaving them at a shocking $3.50. These aren't your typical crappy, sugar filled, sour punch type of margaritas. They are quality, fresh lime, patron citronge, carefully thought out margaritas. I usually pair my lime marg with their pork belly or green chile chicken tacos. I've tried a large portion of their menu, and things that I would like to highlight would be their chorizo nachos, flank steak entree, torta, and pork belly taco. They also have Escabeche on their menu which I hold dear to my heart. It reminds me of the Mexican restaurants in Chicago that have these pickled veggies already on the table. Give this place a try. Get a taco, get a torta, and DEFINITELY get a lime margarita."}
{"text":"Meh, there were good and bad about this place. The Good: Staff was super nice and friendly. The decor is brightly colored, funky and clean. Great location. Their Guac and chips were excellent. Loved the Cauliflower taco. Also really like their Street Corn side. A lot of vegetarian options. The Disappointment: Most of their tacos were too spicy. We had the Carne Asada, fish, el Pastor, all were left barely eaten cuz of the taste. Wish they had a standard ground beef taco."}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side for the food court quality food you get. One notable thing for me was the tea: it tastes like dish water and I only had one sip of it before deciding to abandon it. Won't go back again, if you have the time and are downtown, go to kaiju instead for their excellent Japanese curry."}
{"text":"Service is hot garbage. They are incapable of flipping a table in under an hour a half; then tell people the wait is an hour when it's truly 3 hours.   Avoid"}
{"text":"Pretty great food, not so great service. We sat at the bar and were completely ignored for about 10 minutes until we sort of forced our presence known. A table of 4 of us were seated about 30 minutes later. Drinks took well over 20 minutes every time to receive and any alterations to food were ignored. However, the food is pretty darn good! Worth braving the spotty service for. We'll be back. Perhaps, the FOH will have their stuff in order by then."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The chips are homemade and phenomenal and the salsa is great! We will be eating here again very soon."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when my boyfriend and I can't decide where to go. It is always good. The place is small so you may have to wait to get a table on the weekend, but you can often gets seats at the bar. Last time I was there they had a special menu the benefit the second harvest food back that was quite tasty, especially the chicken tinga taco."}
{"text":"This place is a really cool space with great decorations. I haven't gotten food yet so I can't speak to that. However, I went on a Friday night and they were out of lime juice so they couldn't make margaritas. How does a taco restaurant/tequila bar run out of margarita ingredients?"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but I will have to give it another chance.  On a good note, the Duritos they give you for a 'warm up' are pretty darn good! I ordered a few tacos and everyone but one of them was bland (the pork belly was great!), I was really kind of sad because I read that the Calabacitas taco was great and it literally tasted like, nothing. I have to think I just got one that was not seasoned that day or went on an off day. The space is beautiful but feels really cramped, and it was busy when we went. Last but not least, my co-worker ordered a salad that was meant to be an entrée and it was SUPER tiny.....like I'm all about not over-serving, but she had to literally come back to work and eat again."}
{"text":"You'd never expect it from seeing the exterior or the location, but their selection of Hong Kong style dishes is huge....but their quality was SHOCKING for the price.  Big portions, flavoured really well, and all for under $10 with soup and drink.  Highly recommend checking it out if you're looking for a Hong Kong style cafe in downtown Toronto with totally acceptable prices."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner at Canteen last night. We  had an enjoyable time- great company, lots of laughter, lively decoration and atmosphere. We ordered from the Food Fight Foodie Week menu, which was priced great.   However, we were not impressed by the food and service. For appetizers we had nachos with queso and street corn. The sauce in the corn was good- creamy with lime, chile, and a sprinkling of cheese, but the corn tasted like thawed frozen corn. The queso could have been cheesier. We had the enchiladas and tacos for entrees and felt that the description on paper sounded much better than the actual dish! The bits of pork belly in the taco were well marinated, but overall the dishes were pretty bland. Dessert was okay- choco taco and caramel flan.. but the funniest comment of the night was when my friend said that the choco taco \"tasted too healthy\".   Also, we weren't going to have alcohol beverages that night but our server made comments that hinted that we should order drinks- \"do you need more time to order drinks from the DRINKS menu\" and eventually when we said no, it was quite awkward when she said \"so you guys are only going to drink water tonight?\". Thinking back, hey, maybe a drink or two may have made the food taste better!"}
{"text":"HOLY SH*T everything here is delicious. The street corn and cauliflower taco are to die for.  Half price margs during happy hour! If it's in season, I would recommend the honeydew cucumber margarita!"}
{"text":"My crew really enjoyed our dinner here. Some got tacos, others got plates, and some got both! The sweet potato durados were delicious and we loved the homemade choco tacos!"}
{"text":"Another Food Fight restaurant for the win! These guys know what they are doing!  We brought our 3 year old toddler here with us for dinner. She is pretty well behaved at fancy restaurants and we always have books and her iPad as reinforcements. She LOVED the jicama salad (she called them cucumbers) I wasn't going to correct her especially when she was eating vegetables of her own accord.  The crunchy pinwheel Duritos were reminiscent of my youth. We called them friyums in India and devoured these as kids.   We ordered four of their vegetarian tacos - Calabacitas, grilled cauliflower, farmers cheese and roasted poblano taco (from the harvest menu). We loved them all really hard to pick a favorite. The grilled farmers cheese was delish and the tomatillo purée on the calabasitas was soooo fresh and tangy and yummy!!   We also ordered a side of crunchy rice and beans and the Mexican street corn. Loved the corn the crunchy rice was a bit to crunchy for us (like eating raw rice).   Overall fantastic place!!! We will definitely be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Wanted to try someplace new and this place won.  The service was great and everyone was very nice.  The drinks were a bit expensive but they were pretty good.  I had the chicken burrito and it was alright.  A bit dry for my taste and I had to use all of the salsa they gave me on it.  It was not bad for the price but it could be better.  I tried some of my girlfriends enchiladas and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Madison. To start, the nachos are incredible - the cheese sauce is real cheese, somehow the chips don't get soggy, and the toppings compliment each other very well. I have only ever gotten tacos for a main dish, and they have great flavor. My only complaint is that they recently pared down the taco menu (bring them back please!) but there are still good options to choose from. As far as drinks go, the spicy margarita has a good kick and the tequila flights have plenty of varieties available. My one piece of advice is that you should definitely get the nachos though."}
{"text":"Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I had a really rotten experience at Canteen. Canteen is an upscale Mexican bistro, located in a restored building on the east side of Capitol Square.   We were served circular corn puffs seasoned with cumin (I guess instead of tortilla chips) as the free appetizer. They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing.   Things went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn't even melted. I have ordered medium rare steaks around the world, but this beef was completely blue/purple - it was downright unsafe.   The rest of the meal was mediocre-average. The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good.   When I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair). These were the worst churros I've ever had. They were completely stale and greasy. They smelled like expired, cheap soybean oil and I had to spit out the small bite I took.   When I got home (not surprisingly) I had terrible stomach pain.   The staff took our concerns seriously and it was nice to have a nearly-free dinner, but for god's sake don't go near Canteen."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place!  I also really appreciate how vegetarian friendly their menu is.  We tried some of their tacos (fish, cauliflower, grilled cheese, pork belly, chicken) and liked them all - I can't decide what my favorite was.  We also had the street corn and their crispy rice side dishes.  Both were good, but the crispy rice was REALLY good and a huge serving.  Definitely enough for 2 people and a lot of leftovers to take home.  Also tried the flan, which was out of this world good.    I tried their classic margarita and liked it a lot.  I prefer a strong tequila and lime taste in mine, and this was perfect - not too sugary sweet.  However, I do have to say that the margaritas aren't a great value compared to a few other nearby restaurants with a similar theme/menu.  They're the same price as other restaurants, but half the size.  It's a great value at happy hour though, when they're half price, so go then if you want to try some of them."}
{"text":"My workplace is about a block from Canteen. The food is generally pretty good - big fan of the new burritos on their menu.  My major issue is with an extremely spotty pick-up experience. Canteen and other food fight restaurants have food delivery/pickup via app using ChowNow. The app is fine, but as of late ordering pickup has been painful. I don't think my expectations are that high - order online, have the order ready to pickup in 30 minutes, but I've been let down the last two times:  Take 1 (three weeks ago): Was super hungry, ordered pickup at 12:07, get an email 18 minutes later that it'll be ready for pickup at 12:55 PM.  Take 2 (today): Ordered around 11:25, got email saying my order would be ready at 11:54. Got there at 12:04, saw my order on the counter, and had to wait ten minutes for them to pack up my to-go order and let me on my way.   Again, I like the food, it's just frustrating having such subpar pickup experiences. I'd like a place I can count on when I want to grab something quick downtown, but I guess I'll have to stick to the food carts."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 4:30.  No wait and great service.   I had the house and strawberry margarita and I can't decide which one I liked best.  The other guests felt the same way.   Both were very good.   We ordered guacamole to start, which was good but the chips are delicious.  I would have to say the best I've had.  I realize chips are a personal preference and everyone has their own opinion.   The wagon wheels were quite tasty too, but it's a good thing they are free because I don't think any of us would order them otherwise.    Chicken enchiladas were the best meal out of the three we ordered.  The verde sauce was very good.  Griddled burrito was good, but the enchilada was better.  Tacos were tasty as well according to my dining partner.  The best thing about the whole meal was the Mexican street corn!  Wow.    I look forward to returning for the street corn alone."}
{"text":"Service was great last night but food was underwhelming.    It's sad to say this may be the first taco place that I didn't like.  Only 1 out of 5 tacos we tried were good.  Also their take on a chip is bad, the seasoning is good but please change the Durito things that look like wagon wheels."}
{"text":"Loved the crispy rice and beans! Totally unexpected and totally delicious! Also ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos. I've had better but these were up there, especially for this type of restaurant. Definitely recommend this place, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Goodbye nostrano; hello canteen.  We've been to canteen twice - really enjoyed it both times. The salsas are excellent and even have a little heat. The guac and durados are solid to start with. Margs are good and affordable at $7. Prices seem fair overall.  Tacos have been consistently good and seem a step up from traditional mexican food. The standout is Calabacitas (vegetarian squash) where you don't even miss the meat."}
{"text":"Ordered a whole bunch of tacos to go last night and they all got rave reviews. The cauliflower tacos were a special treat! Plus the chips are super yummy and addicting..."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are really good. The street corn is absolutely amazing. Margaritas could've been a little bit better. The waitress and staff were very good."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The cocktails and food were both delicious, and the prices were reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early afternoon bite to eat on New Year's eve and we were not disappointed.  My partner had tacos and I enjoyed the enchiladas.  The flavors were all very good.  Since it was a bit of an \"off time\" there was only one server working, but she was quite capable of handling the few occupied tables.  I will say that it was a very cold day, and the restaurant itself also felt quite cold.  I am guessing the older windows don't make it easy to keep heated.    Canteen seems like a bit of a step up from TTTP - which is also a favorite Food Fight spot of ours.  We'll definitely be back to Canteen."}
{"text":"Our son and DIL suggested we all go to Canteen during the Madison Food Fight Week, and wow were we ever happy with their suggestion. We were immediately warmly greeted and seated for our reservation. We all enjoyed our tequila cocktails and my strawberry margarita was perfect. The street corn had amazing flavor and I was grateful that it is served in a bowl and not on the cob. The only thing missing was some char on the corn. The queso and chips had a nice flavor, but it was a little to thin for our liking.The chicken enchiladas were made with perfectly trimmed and moist thigh meat, and well flavored tomatillo sauce. The side of dirty rice was a pleasant surprise and much better than the usual Mexican rice.  Two in our party ordered the chaco taco and the other two the flan. The chaco taco was good, but the flan was stellar! We all agreed it was the best flan we had ever eaten. Our server Maddy was attentive and helpful with suggestions. Overall a wonderful dining experience for someone who is not easily impressed. I would rate Canteen a minimum 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The tacos were pretty good and the pin wheel things they give you for free (first round) are alright as well. I feel like they played it safe with most of the preparations and unfortunately it has left the food kind of lackluster, but at least they didn't butcher anything. As with most food fight concepts they tried really really hard on the concept and it comes out a little contrived/hokey, not a home run but at least they didn't whiff!"}
{"text":"I love love love Canteen. I love the decor, the vibe, and the food! I'd say they are a pretty vegetarian friendly place and have great margaritas.  I ordered the Mexican Street Corn, Sweet Potato Dorados, and a Spicy Margarita. The Mexican Street Corn was very well balanced in flavors with the cheese, creamy  mayonnaise, spice, and I believe they put a little bit of the Tajin spice. The Sweet Potato Dorados were beautifully served with a sweet and tart red sauce. It also came with a side of Mexican style rice with beans, corn, and a seasoning for flavor on the rice. The Spicy Margarita wasn't really spicy but it was delicious. The rim of the cup was dipped in the Tajin spice that paired very well with the margarita.   I recommend this place for a romantic chill date, for people who are visiting from out of town, and/or people who enjoy some good Mexican style food. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I came to Madison for a work trip, and staying at the  Hilton I wanted something that was close by and also delicious. I had a craving for Mexican food, and since Canteen was close by, I thought why not? To be honest, I had very little expectations coming from California and growing up on amazing Mexican food in LA and now in SF. I ordered the Carne Asada and it was incredibly flavorful, complemented with a Mole sauce and minced meat and potatoes that I have never seen anywhere. The salsas-red, green, and sweet (?) were absolutely phenomenal. I'd come back to Madison again just for Canteen's carne Asada dish. Glad I came here"}
{"text":"Spent three weeks in Madison for work and ate here at least 10 times. Incredible margs and incredible food. I never leave reviews but my wife and I have been craving their margs, street corn, durritos and burritos since we got home so I figured it's worth sharing this hidden gem. Happy hour is a STEAL as well. Absolutely love this place, must try if you're in Madison."}
{"text":"I've been to Canteen now twice since it opened and its pretty good.  I was psyched to hear and read about it prior to opening and I don't think it disappointed, it just has some improvements to make.  The decor and space are both very inviting and festive.  It is limited by an awkward shape and crowded but those are not bad things!!  The first time I came I had a margarita, guac/chips, carnitas, fried cauliflower, and fish tacos.  They were all pretty good but the fried stuff (cauliflower and fish) were heavily breaded and not hot enough so both felt a little heavy.  I would love to see a fish taco option that was not fried.  The guac is delicious...and the margaritas were good...but nothing special.  I'd love to see a spicy margarita option and just some more options in general.    I went again last night and had the carne asada and farmers cheese taco....these were not great.  The farmers cheese just isn't my thing so my fault for a bad order.  But the carne asada needs to reduce the chipotle/smoke flavor a bit- it takes over.  Also, all 3 of my tacos last night had cold filling so that didn't help.  I will be back again in the hopes that its heading on up!"}
{"text":"Was hoping for more flavor and creativity from a Food Fight restaurant. It seemed like a lot of carnitas or meat but short on the toppings. The service was impressive for after the Ohio game."}
{"text":"The space (although a bit small) is well decorated and has a good atmosphere. We had to wait about 15-20 mins even at 1pm on a Saturday but they have a texting option so we walked around the square enjoying the end of the farmer's market until we were texted that the table was ready.  We all got different tacos - I chose the carne asada and the fried cauliflower and liked both.  Overall they have a good variety in their options and we were all satisfied.  Nothing was incredible but it was all good and the good service and atmosphere bump it from a 3 to a 4 for me."}
{"text":"I have to admit..I'm a traditionalist when it comes to street tacos preferring small, authentic joints to hipster versions but Canteen delivers.  My friend and I went on a chilly weeknight and loved the homemade Doritos, street corn and delicious cocktails.  Affordable, unique and tasty - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here during their weekday happy hour and it was delicious! Half price margaritas? Yes, please. I had the Mezcal Margarita which was strong in alcohol and in flavor - a smoky, citrusy drink that's tart, savory, and sweet. So well balanced. I easily could've sipped several. My partner had the spicy margarita and that was also delicious in its own way.   For food, I ordered the Griddled burrito and those black beans were velvety smooth. My partner ordered the fish, carne asada, and pork belly taco. I really enjoyed the carne asada taco. I wanted a little more sweetness from pork belly taco, but I think that stemmed from my own expectations rather than anything about the dish itself.   I also love their decor. I saw the red wall with felted little pods and little air plants hanging out and started plotting how I can get something like that in my own place. The bright flowery wallpaper was festive. It somehow hit the right tone of casual, trendy, and let loose vibe."}
{"text":"I popped back in to this sweet little place on a recent Tuesday early evening...such a fabulous time to dine!! Glorious early evening light, happy diners, excellent outdoor seating!! Just an overall great place to be at the start of summer with happy local folks! I had the Fried Cauliflower Taco, Grilled Tecate Fish Taco and Grilled Baja Burrito, washing it down with a couple of ice cold Pacificos...Faaaaabulous!!! As always, the server was fun, knowledgeable and had just the right amount of attentiveness to not be hovering! This is a fantastic place for tacos and one of the best settings in downtown for just off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"A modernized asian fusion as I'm not a fan of mainland food. A variety of HK, Malaysian and Singaporen food. Curry fish head noodle is my fav so far, sambal fried rice is good as well (bit too salty, also it's pretty spicy for non heat lover) and i always order lemon coke (i don't see elsewhere serving this).  The only con is, they only accept cash.  RECENT UPDATE: They serve SAMBAL PETAI AND SHRIMP WITH RICE. OMG. DIED. It's a but pricey though like around $11-$12 but hey it's worth it if it helps to remedy homesickness."}
{"text":"Stopped here mainly for drinks and some appetizers.  While the cocktails were great, the free homemade dortitos were outstanding and probably the best part about coming here.  The ceviche was fresh, but a little expensive for a \"snack\" at $14.  My only knock was the small servings of chips that came in quite possibly the smallest paper bag ever made."}
{"text":"Yummmyyyy!!! Had an hour lunch during training and we got in and out in 40 min. The food was excellente and service on par. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is pretty incredible here. I definitely recommend it. The food is good, but I rave about the strawberry margarita way more than my actual meal. I've noticed that service is sometimes a little spotty. Once or twice I've gone and could definitely tell they were under-staffed, but nothing unforgivable."}
{"text":"Ordinary service, and 45 minutes for a simple lunch.   Really need to work on restaurant  ventilation, I know smell like oil..."}
{"text":"There are a lot of new Mexican restaurants downtown, but our hearts belong to Canteen. Here's why we have become regular customers:   The food: Definitely try the torta--the bread is crispy and well-proportioned to the fillings, which are beautifully balanced in texture and quantity. On the side are perfectly pickled, crisp vegetables (escabeche). Another must-try is the Mexican street corn. Though the chefs sometimes overdo it on the aioli, this dish is the perfect blend of sweet, salty, spicy, and tart. And the tacos? YUM. My favorite is carnitas, which comes topped with a sweet and spicy mango habanero sauce. We're also addicted to the nicely-spiced duritos--or wagon wheels--that you get for free with your meal. We always order a second bag.   The drinks: Canteen's strawberry margarita is one of my favorite drinks in town. It is sweet, but well-balanced, and the hibiscus and chartreuse give it a really unique flavor. Another favorite is the pistolero: smokey and citrusy, tiny and strong. We love Canteen's happy hour, which is every day (!) from 2pm-5pm. Half-priced strawberry margaritas? Yes, please.   The environment: It's cozy, intimate, warm, and bright, with beautiful & colorful Mexican decor. The music is festive, yet not obtrusive. We can spend hours here!   The service: We love the food and the drinks here, but the staff is what keeps us coming back every week. (Yes, every week.) Everybody is so friendly, generous, and helpful, and they truly seem to like where they work. Thank you Ally, Leah, Lyle, and the rest of the staff at Canteen for making every visit a great one!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant my friends and I go almost every Friday.   [Location] 5/5 It is located in Chinatown (Dundas St W and Spadina Ave), inside Dragon City on the second floor.  [Service] 4/5 The waitress were very friendly because they recognized us as soon as we entered the restaurant  [Food Quality] 3/5 It is typical Chinese (Cantonese) style food. Great portion, cheap price with acceptable taste.  [Overall] 4/5 For people live in Downtown, it is a good place where you can easily feed yourself with around $13."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent service and food options. As a vegetarian, I was very impressed by the amount of vegetarian options. I ordered the fried cauliflower tacos and they were amazing! The pitcher of margarita is well priced and great tasting. Our waitress was very sweet as well. Overall great experience and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The beef griddled burrito is amazing!! The service was top notch also. Our group also ordered a couple of veggie tacos which were also great!"}
{"text":"My wife, kids and I had dinner this past Sunday.  The duritos as the table were a nice touch.  The house margarita was fairly good and better at happy hour prices.  My kids each had a carne asada taco, my wife had three tacos, fish, carnitas and asada and I had the carnita burrito.  There was not anything special about the food.  We also ordered guacamole.  The waitress asked if this was an appetizer and I said yes.  I was surprise to see that since we ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, that there was a charge for tortilla chips.  The waitress did not tell me that we would be charged for chips.  I looked back at the menu and saw in a convoluted way that it shows that there would be a charge for the tortilla chips.  I may go back there for their happy hour but would not go back for food."}
{"text":"I had been super excited to try Canteen since it opened  And we finally had time this weekend to go, and. was pretty disappointed.  Our server was awesome, food came out quickly and correct.   The guacamole was just OK and was overpriced for the portion.   The fish tacos were the best thing we had in the server was right on that.. there are no Big and Little's but they're still really good.  I'm pretty sure the street corn was corn out of a can and the sauce avert a enchiladas the chicken was dry and the sauce was a little bit on the greasy side.  Carnitas taco was also ok, but not great in that the meat was dry w sauce trying to make up for that Misgiving"}
{"text":"Canteen is like ever other Food Fight Restaurant-it's never terrible but it is also not a place to have an amazing meal.  Definitely some hit or misses.  For the hits, the #1 are the Duritos-puffed wheat wagon wheels with chili and lime seasoning.  The first bag is free and subsequent ones are $1.  They are completely addicting and pair well with a beer.  The street corn is also a favorite of mine.  What is there not to like when you pair corn, chili lime aioil, butter, and cotija cheese?  Although the other tacos are less memorable, the Fried Cauliflower taco is one I would eat again.  The cauliflower was battered and perfectly fried with a guajillo cream suace and topped with a radish and red onion slaw.  For the misses, I would throw the rest of the tacos into the mix.  They are not terrible but just meh.  The carnitas were rather mushy while the farmers cheese taco was a congealed block of regret topped with some toppings.  Wait staff are fast and friendly.  On it's own, I would consider stopping back but with Bel Air a block away, I know where I will be going for my taco fix!"}
{"text":"Loved the veggie tacos and how accommodating they were to special requests (vegan and no cilantro)"}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday around 8:30pm and there was no wait for a party of two. I needed something light to eat so I got the pork belly taco ($3.50) and the cauliflower taco ($3.50) and absolutely loved both. Even though the cauliflower taco is vegetarian, it was full of flavor and I actually liked that one slightly more than the pork belly. I really liked how the creama and tomatillo slaw helped balance out the guajillo chile the cauliflower was fried in; Canteen does an excellent job playing with flavors. I definitely want to come back for their happy hour and try some of their drinks."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and I'm mad I haven't been here sooner! First of all, the decor is really unique with a lot of cool artwork (and air plants), and just felt super modern and cozy. I tried the spicy margarita and it was surprisingly good- I have a hard time with tequila being too strong sometimes but the spice really balanced it out. I ordered the guacamole, street corn, and the cauliflower and carnitas tacos. The guac was good, the carnitas taco could have been better. However the cauliflower taco blew me away (who knew it could taste so good??), and the street corn was by far the best thing I ordered. Whatever they put on it, it's amazing. If you're looking for some delicious tacos, good margs, and friendly service, definitely check out Canteen the next time you're downtown."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this more stars because the food was great, but too many slip ups happened during our visit, unfortunately.   The good: Bright, colorful decor. We went on a Thursday night and didn't have trouble finding a table. It's smaller than I expected on the inside, but not overly crowded. We started with an order of guacamole, and it was delicious and topped with cheese. Will definitely order again. Drinks were strong. I ordered the spicy margarita and I liked it. Not my favorite ever, but enjoyable and refreshing. Our waiter was very friendly.   The not-so-good: We got our guac and drinks right away, but when we noticed the couple who sat down after us already had their meals, we wondered if they'd forgotten about our order. Our waiter came and said they'd lost our ticket or something so the food should be out shortly. It took about 45 mins to get food.   My bf ordered the beef burrito (smothered), and I ordered a carnitas and a cauliflower taco, since Yelp said the cauliflower was awesome. The waiter recommended the carnitas too.   Our waiter brought our food and started to walk away but I saw that his burrito didn't come smothered. I said something, so they took it back and brought it out again with cheese. OK. My tacos didn't look right to me, but our waiter wasn't anywhere to be found so I dug in. It did get busy by the time we got our food, so I understand that the waiter probably was running around.   The first one (which was actually chicken, not the carnitas I ordered) tasted great! Well balanced and awesome, flavorful tortillas. The second one was fish, not cauliflower :( It was fried, which sometimes upsets my stomach... but it tasted great! Good seasoning and lots of flavors there. But not what I ordered. I grabbed our waiter again to ask about our order, and they realized it was the wrong order. They apologized for the mix up.  At some point, our waiter said they could ask a manager about a discount. They clearly felt really bad, and we reassured that it was OK; we still liked the food. I was surprised that when the check came out, there was nothing comped. I'm not usually one to complain but since there were several things wrong (super late food, no smothered burrito, wrong orders for both of us), I asked if there was anything they could do. I was uncomfortable asking about it but felt like there were a few too many oops moments. They ended up taking off the guacamole, which was nice.   Overall, a mixed bag for us. We really liked the food we got (carnitas burrito, chicken taco, fish taco), but we really wanted the food we ordered. Seems like this isn't usually the case from reading other reviews, so hopefully it was just an off night for them and not typical."}
{"text":"Very surprised to see the 5 star reviews here. We tried this place over the weekend and found it to be average, if that. I should start by saying I have nothing in particular against Food Fight, the corporate monolith that is behind 10 or so restaurants in Madison who owns this place. I do lament the demise of Nostrano which used to fill this space as it was one of Madison's finest restaurants. Food Fight also has some great restaurants. Fresco, for example, is certainly one of Madison's top five restaurants.   This place, to me, falls well short of some of their other offerings. I think this place could take lessons from Eldorado Grill, for example. We started with the ceviche. It was served in a less than imaginative pile on a white plate surrounded by a handful of chips. The scallops and shrimp in it were rubbery and the flavor was uninspired. The dish also lacked color and freshness usually contributed by tomatoes and jalepenos. Below average dish.   Next we had a few tacos including barbacoa and al pastor. Both were stone cold. While there was nothing particularly wrong with these tacos, they were both just \"meh.\" Both lacked inherent flavor and spice and had to be doused with the two sauces that were on the table. Those sauces, incidentally, were the highlight of the visit. They appear to be house made and both were delicious. Sad that we had to use them so liberally.   We also tried the margaritas. Nothing special there either. This place struck me as a less flavorful Bel Air (Milwaukee). Mexican food is supposed to be as far from bland as possible, yet these dishes were bland.   I'll give it another try, but the first visit was a disappointment."}
{"text":"My mom, fiancé, and I went here for lunch the day after I got engaged! It was a perfect place to go for a celebratory lunch. We really liked the atmosphere: fun, brightly lit, very friendly staff. We happened to come during happy hour, so we took advantage of the half priced margaritas, which were phenomenal. The chips and guac were also very on point. Fresh, balanced, with really thick salty chips: everything you want in chips and guac. I ordered a pork belly taco and a fish taco, with a side of street corn. The pork belly taco knocked my socks off and the fish taco was good, but not stellar. The street corn however: I could eat that forever. Granted, I would be on the fast train straight to obesity town because it's basically a bowl of corn and mayo, but my god is it delicious. Overall, we were really satisfied with our meal and will definitely be back. I'm rating this place a 4 instead of a 5 because I'm partial to authentic Mexican food and this has a heavy American twist, but if you come here looking for a nice atmosphere, quality margaritas, satisfying guacamole, and a couple Americanized yet creative tacos, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped at Canteen for a lunch meeting during the week and enjoyed my experience overall. Having never been to Nostrano, the interior was much smaller than I expected. I love all the color, though, and even at the height of lunch hour there was no wait for a table.   I arrived a bit before my lunch companion and the server was patient while I waited for her to arrive. After she arrived we needed another couple of minutes with the menu, and that resulted in a large gap before being able to place our orders (10+ minutes), but other than that minor hiccup everything else went smoothly.   I was excited to try the duritos, an item I've seen on shelves and at markets for years, but we weren't offered any. Perhaps they're just a dinnertime thing?   I had the sweet potato dorados, which had a light sweet potato and veggie filling in a crispy rolled tortilla with a corn salad on top. It was basically a cannoli-sized taquito. The flavors all played really well together and I left satiated but not too full to be productive for the rest of the afternoon.   My meeting partner and I split a house-made choco taco after our entrees. Good flavor; I loved the crunchy pepitas and quality chocolate coating. I do wish the waffle cone shell had been crispy though instead of soft. It felt a little like what I imagine wet cardboard would be like and mixing up textures would have been a welcome addition to the soft ice cream.   If you want to gussy up your Mexican food experience, head on over to Canteen."}
{"text":"Decent fancy taco joint on the Capitol Square. We sat outside on a nice Spring evening and were glad we did as the inside seating is pretty close quarter and noisy.  The house margarita was descent. I had a variety of tacos - pork, shredded beef and a fish taco. The fish taco was sort of meh and flavorless. The other two are worth ordering again.   Not the cheapest or most authentic Mexican food in town, nice. Good vibe and decent service, and quality product."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this hip \"fusion\" taqueria + tequila bar! Their dishes are creative, with a menu that is not overwhelming, and filled with options for both meat-lovers and vegetarians. You order \"by the taco\", so you're able to create a plate of different ones to sample. Love that!  Their duritos, which they serve in place of chips and salsa, are little, fried/seasoned wheels of goodness! Unique idea!  My favorite taco that I tried was the Grilled Farmers Cheese taco, though the fish taco was fresh and flavorful (but a bit too spicy for me). Their meat tacos weren't my favorite - the Al Pastor was a bit dry. Honorable mention goes out to their street corn - worth a try - super flavorful and unique.  Finally, the interior of this place is super hip and colorful - very nice decor. It's overall a nice place to visit with friends for a quick lunch near the Capitol!"}
{"text":"Fun spot not far from the capital.  My niece introduced me to this place last year when I visited her at UW Madison.  She recently graduated and the family came here afterwards per her request.  Margarita's are delicious, mostly because they are made without a super sweet mix, especially liked the spicy version, just enough chili infused tequila to give it a kick, but not overwhelm.  You get this cute bag of wagon wheel shaped puffed wheat snacks to munch on, lightly salted and seasoned, yummy!  Guacamole and street corn were both excellent.  Nice selections for vegetarians.  Tried several items from tacos to burritos, all really high quality ingredients and great flavors.    Service has been good on both visits, second time was with a big group and they accommodated us well considering it is kind of a small place."}
{"text":"3 for 3 here. Their margaritas aren't pure syrup like other places and everything I've eaten was excellent. I don't understand why people try to hide the taste of the tequila, if you don't like it get a slurpee."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends the other weekend-the decorations,setup, and overall vibe is adorable-think woven bowls on the walls and decorative faux-cow skulls.  Great drink and food selections, margaritas were a bit on the pricey side. I got the grilled farmers cheese taco, the Baja fish taco, and the fried cauliflower taco with a side of street corn.   Street corn was delicious, with a lime juice and (maybe garlic?) aioli and spices, and the cauliflower taco was my favorite, with the fish in a close second- the chipotle sauce on it is SO good!  My only suggestion is that they add shrimp tacos to the menu since I'm sure they'd be amazing!  Note that the tacos don't come with a side of beans and rice, so you have to order that separately.   Overall super cute and unique place to go for dinner.  Definitely different from other Mexican restaurants in Madison and one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I ordered the griddled burrito (but I got the calabacitas to replace the meat options) and it was amazing! The service was fast, and the waitress was amazingly friendly! For people who are familiar with latinx street food, she kindly offered us a free extra bag of duritos as a compliment to the long wait! The wait staff was extremely pleasant and the service and the food was great! My only qualm is that the music is particularly loud, and so it's hard sometimes to have conversation with whomever you're getting dinner with unless you're talking loudly, but otherwise I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my faves! So glad I found this place on Yelp.  So far, my favorite spot in Madison, which is full of good restaurants already. Cauliflower taco is hard to describe and the title probably doesn't entice, so you have to trust the menu, and other Yelpers.  It's excellent. Strongly advise El jefe if you're choosing from the margarita menu: worth the extra dollar.  ( still worth the up charge even during happy hour) Great service. Great vibe."}
{"text":"High quality tacos - low prices. Fell in love with their cauliflower taco and mango habanero salsa. {spicy & delish}. Will be back for many more tacos and Patrick Sullivan's company."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend. Happened to be Cinco de Mayo, so we thought we'd stop in for lunch and a margarita. The service was really slow. Granted it was Cinco de Mayo but it didn't seem all that busy. The margarita was pretty good but the taco salad with chicken not so much. It was mostly bland iceberg lettuce, pulled chicken (only dark meat), and very little other ingredients (pico, black beans, etc.). My wife's burrito with grilled fish was pretty good. The fish was cooked well. No complimentary chips and salsa which is sort of a deal breaker for me because it's my favorite part when it's good."}
{"text":"You'll be surprised by how tasty the food is here! My mom actually suggested this restaurant for me to try. We went there for an afternoon snack. We shared a ham and egg sandwich and escargot (with complimentary garlic bread). The escargot was surprisingly very good. Both meals came with complimentary tea."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Friday night. A table for 5 had about an hour and a half wait.   Once we got seated, the food came pretty quickly. I tried all three veggie tacos on the menu as well as the fish taco. The tacos were overall okay- not memorable and  not disappointing. The cauliflower taco had a nice crunch to it and I liked the flavor of the fish taco- but nothing left me wowed.  We also ordered the street corn. It was good- but again not amazing.   The yellow colored hot sauce that came with the food was amazing.   A little disappointed overall since the restaurant before ( Nostrano) had some of the best food around. Then again, Madison was missing a Mexican spot that catered to vegetarians. Given the price point ( it was super reasonable with around 4 bucks a taco on average) , if come back here if I was in the mood for tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos and margaritas were really good. One of the better Mexican places in Madison! Service was a little slow, but other than that, I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We were recommended by a local staff at a mini mall. He said the food was great! so we went here the next day for lunch.  The place is very dim. I then realized because most of the spot lights are out and they did not fix it. It is very noticable since some table were brightly lit and some weren't. Places like this should be brightly lit, it is def not a romantic place or anything like that.  When taking our orders, the waitress looked annoyed when my friend change her food within a second of changing her mind. It wasn't like they made the food already. She was still taking my order.   Most of the entree came with soup of the day and garlic bread which is a plus. I really felt that the food was mediocre. The only good thing was the honey chicken wings. That was good!"}
{"text":"Wandered in as we were walking around Chinatown looking for a late lunch. Had their \"afternoon tea\" menu, which were specially priced HK-style small plates. Really enjoyed our meal Malaysian noodles, Montreal grilled pork chop over spaghetti, Sambal fried rice, fried chicken wings, cold lemon tea, cold almond tea. The whole thing was $18. Friendly service in a casual setting. Lighting was indeed dim, but I found it relaxing and very chill. Would go again."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon with a couple of friends for a late afternoon lunch; they were about half full.  Thumbs up on the El Pastor tacos, margaritas, pickled veggies, table hot sauces, and churros. The interior design is fabulous hipster-Hispanic colorful eccentricity. Menu prices are really reasonable.  They start you with a bag of puffed wheat wagon wheels called duritos instead of chips and salsa; the chili lime seasoning on them is delicious, but the puff itself is lacking. These would be fantastic if they were chicharones.   I was a bit disappointed in the farmers' cheese and the calabacitas (squash) tacos. Service was mega slow but they comped the first round of drinks and churros, so I'd try visiting again sometime."}
{"text":"Knowledgable, caring staff. Great price point with more than enough to eat. Seasonal frozen marg was refreshing. Made for an awesome close to our visit to Madison! Thank you Canteen, excellent concept and vibe"}
{"text":"What a great find! Amazing service, amazing food and very clean. You don't find a combination of food, atmosphere and prices in most cities."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but they nailed it.  Varied menu with good drinks and attentive service.  Vegetarian options were good and the price was right.  Small space laid out for maximum effect. I'm curious what happens when Belair opens, but for now they have a niche on the square."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! We came here because of Yelp.  The food is excellent.  We started with their Dorados and Guacamole and a Canteen Bloody.  We then shared the fried cauliflower taco, sweet potato Dorados and the Torta with a side of sweet corn.  All of it was very good and I can't believe I'm stating this but the sweet corn was unbelievable.  Yes--- sweet corn was out of this world!!! I think this is my first 5 stars in Yelp."}
{"text":"THE BEST STREET CORN YOU WILL EVER EAT. Yes, all caps called for on that one. Everything my partner and I ordered was exceptional. The freshly muddled strawberry margaritas, the little delicious chip things that I can't remember the name of but CAN remember the taste of, the fabulous assortment of tacos. I will 100% go back to Canteen next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday just towards the tail end of their brunch but we ordered from the regular menu.  Our server was friendly and very welcoming especially since it was our first time here.  I ordered the Torta which was huge and very tasty.  The mix of ingredients balanced out very nicely.  The pork Milanese was perfectly cooked!  My boyfriend ordered tacos: green chile chicken and brisket.  He loved them both but liked the chicken taco a little more.  I also liked the little pinwheel duritos they give you as soon as you sit down.  We will definitely come back and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I did not know this until my friends invited me out for a post-work dinner. It is a small place but the decorations made it very festive, as if I am celebrating Dia De Muertos. The tacos are very refreshing, and less oily than your typical taquerias. The complimentary duritos they gave at the start of the service was also tasty - it was crispy, savory, and a hint of heat. What sold me is their collection of tequila. You need to be there to truly in awe for what they have. Price might not be the cheapest, but I can definitely see myself come again just to enjoy the night with some tequila. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the long wait. We had to wait for almost 1-1.5 hour for a table for 3. Maybe we came at the wrong hour, but let's see how my 2nd visit would turn out."}
{"text":"Best tacos on the square! Their fish tacos are up there with the best I've ever had, and mix in a margarita with the outdoor seating, it's a go to for my girlfriend and me. I'd also highly recommend finishing off the meal with the churros."}
{"text":"This place was pretty busy on a Friday night and we were looking for a place to eat/ drink before the Preservation Hall jazz band event. We had about a 20 minute wait and were able to order drinks and get seats at the bar. We ended up eating at the bar.  The place is very small inside and very cozy. The bartender mixed up our drink order big time. My hubby ordered a blended strawberry Rita and a specialty drink from the menu and instead we got two lime over the rocks Rita's. We told him it's not what we ordered but hubby felt bad wasting them so he kept the two for himself and ordered another drink for me (the strawberry blended!). The drinks were very strong and delicious. We shrugged it off and tipped well.  After our food we went to cash out our meal and thankfully we double checked the bill because we were double charged for the drinks we had already paid for. An expensive mistake twice and we just shrugged it off determined to have a great night. But from my experience in the food industry and customer service I was a bit shocked what we experienced without much effort to right the wrongs. The staff was too busy to be friendly. The food was just ok. We would only come back if we wanted a strong but expensive drink."}
{"text":"Madison's Mexican restaurants suck for the most part... This is not your traditional Mexican; it's more like a Mexican-style tapas bar. Food is amazing and drinks are phenomenal. Portions are small so I basically tried half the menu. Highlights: cauliflower taco, corn, strawberry margarita, and their addictive tortillas with guacamole and salsas. Highly recommend but don't go if you're starving to death and want to spend little money."}
{"text":"I have been here three times since the opening, and each time it gets better and better! This is the exact place Madison was missing! Great cocktails, amazing tacos, and that street corn?! YUM! The two ladies I've had as servers were so sweet and nice!! I forget the first gals name, but Melissa was fantastic the other night!! Highly recommend this place for a night out!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try this restaurant out during the food fights foodie week. We arrived about 20 minutes to early before they started doing the foodie menu. The manager was so nice and let us get the menu anyways when we said we came for foodie week. They had a 3-course menu for $15.00 that include one appetizer, an entree and a dessert.   To start I  ordered the strawberry margarita and wow was it good. The tequila was strong enough where it enhanced the flavor but did not overtake it.   For appetizers we got the Mexican Street Corn and Escabeche. The Escabeche was a pickled vegetable dish and it was very good. The winner was definitely the corn though. It was rich and creamy with the perfect hint of spicy.   For entree I decided on the Enchiladas. They were stuffed with chicken and smothered in a Verde sauce with a side of loaded Mexican rice. The Verde sauce was so good and the chicken inside was very moist. Overall it was an excellent dish.   Lastly was dessert. There were two option Caramel Flan and the Chocolate Taco. We each ordered one so we could try both. The Chocolate Taco is very creative and fun but the Flan was so rich an delicious.   I am giving this restaurant 5 stars not just because the food was excellent but also so service was as well. At one point my fiance asked for extra hot sauce and the manager went to the back and whipped up a custom salsa. You cannot beat that service! We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The margaritas are super delicious and come in unique flavors including a strawberry jalapeño blend they infused themselves. The food is tasty although portions are a bit smaller than expected. They also have a late night menu which is great because I think it's one of the better places to go to around the capitol for a late night eat."}
{"text":"Definitely go to the \"Hot & New\" Canteen! The decor is adorable, as was our waitress. All of the staff were super nice.  $3 tacos- what a deal! Delicious Margs were $7. Try the guacamole, it's heaven.  The best part was this place was FAST. For a quick, cute and inexpensive dinner- Canteen can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Canteen is one of my all time favorites in Madison! I am a fan of their margaritas and flavorful tacos! One of my favorite tacos is the Calabacitas - a vegetarian taco! It is not common to find such a tasty vegetarian option at a taco restaurant. Additionally, the small space and vibrant decor allow for an intimate and enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"I love these tacos.  As a vegetarian it's a little hard to find filing and delicious options for tacos. My favorite would definitely be the fried cauliflower. On top of having these dope tacos the margaritas are so good.  I have tried them all and I don't have a clear favorite.  But if I had to pick one it would be the frozen strawberry Margarita.  Also they have the best happy hour deal in town."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Canteen, the first was during the Food Fight Foodie Week. I was hooked. I'm kinda surprised we haven't been there a bunch more times.   Thursday night, about 7:30pm. We had about a 10 minute wait at the most. The place was packed, for the second time. People were laughing and having a great time all around. Great sign of a good establishment.   My love for this restaurant started with this simple little bag of \"Duritos\". Once you bite into one, you're immediately hooked. I call it the jacked up Funyuns. We ordered a couple margaritas, Canteen for me and the featured frozen margarita for my wife. Canteen makes THEE best margaritas. They are tasty and strong!! The cucumber/melon frozen margarita my wife had was off the hook, it was sooooooo good. Refreshing and full of booze. Perfect.   Onto the food, I ordered three tacos and the Mexican street corn. I had the Carnitas, Pork Belly and Brisket tacos. The Mexican street corn is addicting. It's so flavorful and a perfect side to my delicious tacos. My favorite was the Pork Belly. Nice crispy ends with a tender middle. Perfect size tacos. Two corn shells, which I believe is the way to go, with LOTS of filling. So much flavor in these tacos. My wife had three tacos as well along with the loaded Mexican rice.   We didn't have dessert this time around, but during Foodie Week, we had the Chocolate tacos. They were a perfect size dessert. They have Flan and Churros for dessert. Next time!!   The service was outstanding. We had our meals within 15 to 20 minutes. Our drinks came easily within 5 to 10 minutes. The server was very knowledgeable and friendly (both times we've been there). They came around twice to ask us about our meal and if we needed anything else. Our plates were whisked away by another gentleman that was all smiles and gracious.   We will be back!! I will spread the word because I appreciate good quality food, outstanding service and great ambience. Thank you"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night at around 7PM. We were told it would be a 15-20 minutes wait so we put our names down and waited at the entrance. It took about 15 minutes to get seated.   We got one bag of Duritos for free--they're sort of like chips. Puffed and seasoned with some spice and lime- addicting!   I got:  Gimme that Strawberry Margarita - Super strong tasting at first, and yes... Brain freeze is definitely an ingredient. It was tasty, refreshing and did I mention strong?  Grilled Farmer's Cheese Taco - This tasted really fresh. One taco was good enough to fill me up because of the sides to got.  Street Corn - Yummmm this was delicious. This does get a bit heavy after awhile but it's so good. I'd suggest sharing it, it was too much for me to finish. I ended up packing half.  Beans with Crispy Rice - This was seasoned really well, it had a nice spice to it. I didn't like the really big chunks of rice in it but the smaller pieces spread throughout the dish really added to the beans because of the crunch it gave. I also packed half of this as well, the portion sizes were pretty good.   I'm definitely coming back here. It's affordable, tasty and they're open super late on the weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Stopped here on a whim and the food was so good!  Wait staff was great, too.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the carne asada tacos and the margaritas!!! Just steps from The Park  Hotel....highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess was great about finding us seats for a table in the bar area!  We shared four tacos. Our favorite was the carnitas--all the toppings worked together. Didn't really need the taco sauces on this one. The Asada was a bit chewy. The cauliflower, while seemed interesting, was breaded so it seemed like too much with the soft taco shells although the flavor was delicious. Surprised to really enjoy the farmer cheese taco--yum!  Margarita was also well executed but short. Happy hour ends at 5pm which is a bummer. Clean and restroom was tidy. I'd go back but not obsessed with returning."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time and enjoyed it so much I came back today for their weekend brunch menu. The atmosphere was great both times and the service was very fast even though the place was packed.   Yesterday, I had guacamole for a starter and finished it almost immediately. Also got chicken and barbecue tacos with a side of elotes, or street corn and all were fantastic.   Today, I got horchata and chilaquiles, both were delicious.   Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Fills a definite need in the downtown area. So often you just need a snack and not a full meal, but you want a little ambiance. This is your place, and the food's great to boot."}
{"text":"A really great find in Madison! I have not had modern tacos in Madison that's this good! Ask for their manager JB and waitress Alexis. Service was great, the atmosphere was extremely welcoming, and the food was AMAZING! The manager/owner makes their rounds and really gets to know the customer, adding a personal touch to your whole experience. Instead of regular chips, they have their own puffed chips which goes really well with their guac! Make sure to get yourself a Margarita because those, as the manager said \"pack-a-punch!\"  So to end, with extreme prejudice, do I highly recommend the Pork Belly tacos!!! Have three, or twelve..... you just simply can't have enough of it. If you want to be adventurous, the Carne Asada and the Beef Brisket are great compliments for it. I only have good things to say about this place, and I am really glad this is in Madison now. Pro-Tip: the lines may be long, but their wait system is through text/call. So put your name down, and grab a drink at any bar on capitol square while waiting!"}
{"text":"Went to Canteen to get some Margaritas and Tacos. The inside is small but had a lot of character and was well decorated. I had the signature Margarita because it was half off during happy hour. It was a surprisingly sour at first, but only because they use actual pressed lime juice instead of pre-made mix that is full of sugar, which made the Margarita more enjoyable over all, so I had 2! My friend and I tried a couple different tacos including Al Pastor, Carnitas, and Green Chile Chicken. Overall, we both agreed that the Green Chile Chicken was the best. One of the managers told us they would be coming out with more menu items in about two weeks, I will definitely be coming back to check it out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I took shelter here to escape the torrential downpour. Although we were soaked to the core, we took our time and enjoyed our lunch.   What we liked: The atmosphere and decoration. This is a lovely little spot with bright colors and great artwork. Every time I looked up I noticed something new on the walls! We both got the cauliflower taco and LOVED it. It had the perfect crunch and chew, with a flavorful sauce as well. I would so get that again. We also loved the street corn appetizer, great mix of textures and not too spicy.   What we weren't so keen about: we ordered chips and guacamole (which happened to be the most expensive thing we ordered), and it was the biggest let down. The chips were drenched in oil, as if they were freshly fried, yet they were cold. The guacamole also seemed like it was a day old and the aftertaste was sharp almost as if it was starting to ferment? Although wasn't to the point where we couldn't eat it, it was disappointing.   Overall I really did enjoy my experience here. I'm assuming (and hoping) the chips and guac comment is unique to me, and that it is a result of the fact that we came on a Monday afternoon at 1:30.   Would I recommend? Yes. Would I return? Yes."}
{"text":"I went to Canteen during their second week open on a Wednesday night. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated, and grabbed drinks at the semi crowded bar where many were standing and a few were eating. My friend and I split a few dishes and heres my run down.  The Good: - Sweet Potato Dorados; these tasted great, and served with flavorful sauces and guacamole. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor matched. - Street Corn; This was my favorite thing we ordered, super tasty, and better than I expected. It has a lot of the garlicy aioli so if that is not your thing maybe ask for it to be light or on the side.  The OK: - Barbacoa taco; this was not as flavorful as other local barbacoa tacos, but it wasn't bad either. It also wasn't greasy which some barbacoa can be. It comes in a single corn tortilla that had not been heated/cooked at all so it ripped open almost immediately and required to be eaten with a fork.   Needs Work: - The drinks; we both were pretty excited to have drinks at a place boasting the tequila options since tequila is our favorite spirit, but the drinks were a big let down. my friend ordered the \"down the rabbit hole\" which sounded really interesting with a good mix of flavors & spices, the actual drink was overwhelmingly sweet and the orange liquor overpowered everything. After a few sips my friend had to send it back and traded it in for a beer since it was not something she could continue drinking. After seeing a table leave two, over half full, blended strawberry margaritas I decided against that and ordered the canteen margarita. This margarita is not too sweet, not too sour, not very strong, not very anything! Probably the most boring margarita I've ever had! I really expected a better margarita from a tacos & tequila place! Considering this is a food fight restaurant and both El Dorado & Tex Tubbs succeed with good margaritas maybe they can help a friend out with a better recipe.   Overall I will probably go back for the two good dishes mentioned, probably try a paloma next time and hope for the best!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Canteen the other night. It was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday night, the space does seem small though. It's a colorful, narrow dining room with a small bar at the front. The hostess was very nice and we seated within minutes even though we were told it would be 15-20 minutes.  They had a wide variety of different tacos, sides, and entrees. Prices seemed very reasonable. I tried the carne asada, pork belly, and brisket tacos. Pork belly was by far my favorite with carne asada being a close second. Brisket had good flavor but was a little dry. The others in our party enjoyed their tacos as well, fried cauliflower was a stand out as well. The waitress also brought out a baggie of chips and some puffs things with lime and chili seasoning on them, they were addictive and we asked for more for $1.  The wait for drinks was a little long but our food came out realitively fast. It would have been nice if the drinks came quicker so we could enjoy then more before the food. They had 3 vegetarian taco options and you could make them vegan. We also had a bowl of crispy rice and garbanzo beans, super tasty. The only thing is that everything was pretty spicy. I didn't mind because I enjoy spicy but I was definitely drinking a lot of water. If you aren't some one who likes spicy food you may want to avoid or ask your waiter what is more mild. It seemed like all the sauces and toppings had heat. A person in our group isn't a fan of spice and didn't eat all of the chicken burrito. But I will definitely be back to Canteen to try more of their tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"Located up in the Capital Square, I was looking for a New Mexican restaurant for us to go. I had a hankering for a margarita too   We ended up sitting at the bar as the people in front of us took the last table. The restaurant is brightly decorated and very lively. It was on the louder side but not too horrible that you had to yell to speak to each other.   I ordered the strawberry margarita which turned out to be too strong. It was frozen, and it can from the machine. I could only drink about half of it before getting a headache. Even my boyfriend mentioned how strong it was. I am wondering if the handmade ones are any better.   For my dinner, I ordered the enchiladas. The green sauce with the cheese on top has so much good flavor. As long as each bite had the sauce and cheese on top, yum!   Service was great and friendly. Since we were sitting at the bar on the side where all the servers were, we had superb service. The only downside was that it started getting a little crowded with people waiting for tables that people started encroaching in our space with their drinks on the table right next to our dishes. I guess that's how the bar is supposed to be, just not what I am used to.   Overall, I would be willing to come back and try out some more food.   Update: 01/27/18 So I came back and tried their tacos. I wouldn't really recommend them as they lacked flavor. I ordered the Green Chile Chicken and the Carnitas. Service was a little slow as they only had two servers. One of them was also acting as host, clean up crew,  and bartender. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have an amazing tequila menu, with lots of great cocktails. The tacos are great, as are the burritos. It's a great environment for dinner or for later in the evening for a drink and a snack. A really cool environment with nice decorations."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas, cauliflower and Barbacoa tacos.   The carnitas was tender and was very flavorful and the cauliflower was just ok. However I found the barbacoa I bit dry and needing more flavor. I would not recommend the seeds that come on top of the barbacoa.   I also got the tortilla chips but I found that they were too greasy. The salsas were delicious though!   For drinks I had the pistolero which was delicious! I love that it comes with a slice of pineapple! However the drink was really small for $8. Seemed a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Best food in Madison, period. Not tacos, food. Their guadillo sauce is just so addicting."}
{"text":"Not what I expected! Even three stars is generous. We got the nachos (apps) and it was just a big tray of nachos without anything which makes it different. There was very little cheese, and just a spoon full of guacamole on it! Tacos were just ok. A bit dry! Needs more flavor and citrus. Street corn was sticking to my teeth! Not sure why but probably something about the corn they used. Not sure if I will go back. Sorry! There are better Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I'm thinking you probably can't fail by ordering most anything on their menu. We stopped in for a late lunch today, and while it was our first visit, it definitely won't be our last.  We had the fried cauliflower taco, the loaded Mexican rice, and the baja burrito with fried cauliflower. I'm not sure if they make their own corn tortillas, but the ones they use for the taco have more corny flavor than than the ones we buy, and they aren't all dry and crumbly. I loved the radish and tomatillo. I was excited about the guajillo red sauce, but there wasn't much of it, and it kind of got lost. They could certainly use more of it on the taco. Guajillo is one of my favorite chilis, as it has the heat, but also has that lovely complex chili flavor I crave. It's a staple in my kitchen for spice blends. The cauliflower is encased in a light, crispy breading. I could eat several of these tacos and be very happy about it.  The loaded rice is fantastic. It's a good combination of the fresh and the roasted. The rice is perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. I loved the chive, corn, black beans and squash bits. There is a bit of cheese involved, but it's so sparse you wouldn't miss it if it wasn't there. I think the guajillo sauce is used on the rice to some extent as well, given its red (not saffron gold) tinge. So good.  The room itself is an echo chamber, and can be quite loud, but once food or drinks arrive there shouldn't be much table talk."}
{"text":"Highlights and Lowlights  1) great food 2) friendly service 3) excellent location  A craft Mexican restaurant in downtown Madison?! FINALLY you are here. This little place, in the old Nostrano spot, is so cute! But, it's little. You are almost guaranteed a wait on the weekend as there are probably only 10 tables inside. We tried last Friday (granted it was Cinco de Mayo) and the wait was a casual 3 hours. Came back on a weeknight and ate at the bar with no waiting!   We were served by the bartender who was very friendly and super knowledgeable of the craft cocktails and food. I was impressed as this place had only been open for about 6 days at this point. The craft cocktails and margaritas were excellent. We ordered chips and guacamole. Chips were good and come in cute little bags, guacamole was ok. You get free \"duh-ritos\" which is a fun spin, but that does mean you are paying for chips and salsa. They have a ton of gluten-sensitive items labeled on the menu (they said they technically can't say gluten free because the fryers are shared). We got the fried fish, farmers cheese, brisket, and chicken tacos on corn tortillas. So so so good!   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Another great surprise find on the Madison square!  An upscale Mexican restaurant where just about everything was on the top of the \"good\" list.  The Carnitas tacos were as good as anywhere I've been. The Carne was overdone but, but the rest of the meal was outstanding!  Don't think twice about giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are among the best in town. The booze is reasonably priced ($5 boliermakers). My favorite was the crispy rice, which is comparable to the toasted rice in bibimbap. The complimentary bag of seasoned \"chips\" is a pleasant edition."}
{"text":"YUM!! Tried this place out on a whim and I was not disappointed. The food was delish! I was really impressed with the kitchen staff. A friend of mine had asked for a sauce to accompany her meal that they didn't make. The waitress apologized and it was no big deal. A couple minutes later the waitress returned with a custom, freshly made sauce that was exactly what my friend had been looking for. The chef in the back made it on the spot specifically for her! Overall, enjoyed this spot very much."}
{"text":"What a very pleasant surprise to find tasty, interesting, fresh--flavored, moderately priced food with excellent service( from Ally) & warm, inviting, colorful decor! Highly recommend & will come back again!"}
{"text":"Minus a half star only for the unfortunate spot they have (more seating would be helpful) and street parking on the square is tough.  This is common with anything here, so I won't dock the review.  This restaurant is bright and colorful with vibrant music playing, well-staffed.  We were here for lunch and while the place was busy we still had immediate seating and an order of Doritos (puffed flavorful wagon wheels) and water along with the menus.  We ordered guacamole and chips because guacamole is one of my favorites but I can never eat it all at home before the avocado starts browning.  This was a light and smooth flavor, with homemade chips that were excellent.  My burrito was a classic, cut in half already to make it easier to eat and you can see by my photos they were stuffed.  I can't do very spicy food so I tend to wander towards the milder foods and this had just enough kick to make it tasty but not overbearing.  I also loved how the burrito shell was also cooked making it firm (no burrito toppings falling out of the shell!) and easier to eat.     Beverages were amazing.  I ordered a seasonal margarita which was hibiscus with cucumber and somehow accidentally got another drink which was a virgin.  Our waitress cleared it up (I didn't really want to switch drinks as the hibiscus drink I had was so good with a hint of cinnamon) by adding tequila to it and making it a unique cocktail I would look for on the menu!    Gracias, Canteen, we will b"}
