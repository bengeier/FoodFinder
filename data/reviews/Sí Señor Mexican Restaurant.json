{"text":"Dang it. I wanted to love this. I really liked them at their old location. The new location is really nice. A lot nicer than the old, to be sure, but the food? Eh. 

We stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday and took advantage of the cheap tacos. They just bring the shells and meat to you and then you finish them off at the taco bar. They had the normal taco fare. Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, different salsas and hot sauces, and (unfortunately) pickled jalapeños. I wish they had fresh jalapeños but whatever. All of the fixings were fresh. 

I got the beef tacos. Big mistake. The beef had the texture (and I assume the taste) of Moon Sand. If you have kids you know what I mean. It was so bland that it could have been served in a nursing home. The texture made me think that whatever meat they used was put into a blender and someone hit purée but then started playing Angry Birds and forgot about it. 

Service was great. Water never ran dry and checks came fast and correct. 

I'll give it one more shot for dinner. I will not be ordering the puréed moon sand tacos again."}
{"text":"First time being there, and it was delicious. Had the Si Señor Special which was fantastic. The enchilada was my favorite part of the dish. The service was great, and quick. Overall good experience and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would go there more but the place smells bad. They use some kind of disinfectant or something to clean their tables with oder permeates the entire restaurant. The food by and large is good nothing spectacular but good. The margaritas seem kind of haphazard I like mine with salt and you can barely see the salt on the rim of the glass. My frozen margarita was watery."}
{"text":"Yuck I am always disappointed when I go here. I just went with some friends recently to give it another chance and now I am certain it is no good. My spinach enchilada was inedible...just some nasty old wilted spinach in a soggy tortilla. My friend had to salt the guac...it had no flavor!! I've never had to salt guac before...ever!!! When I leave I always feel like I just ate low-quality greasy food and I always find myself wishing I had gone to Taco Bell instead. Far tastier and satisfying ! Fourth meal, bitches!!!

I gave it 2 stars cause my husband likes it...even though he was all sick the next day and I had to hear about it. He still wishes we went there more often."}
{"text":"Food was very bland.  the restaurant was a bit smoky as people ordered fajita & there was nowhere for the fajita smoke to ventilate.  

My real problem though was not with the food or the atmosphere, but the staff.  As soon as I revealed that I had a groupon, the staff's attitude drastically changed toward me.  The bill came $2 short of the groupon value which was $20.  We were then told we were not allowed to use the groupon because we didn't spend at least $20.  We told the server to add a soft drink or two to our bill to bump up the price.  She then told us she couln't because the groupon did not cover soft drinks (I then pointed out that nowhere on the groupon did this state that was the case & only alcohol was not included.)  The server then called the manager who repeated the sentiment.  I pointed out the same thing to him & told him the groupon was at least worth the $10 I paid, which he had no repsonse to.  We also told them to just make our bill $20 to even everything out without giving us anything for the extra couple dollars but they refused to do even that!  Finally I was able to talk them into accepting our groupon.

I will definitely NOT be returning to this place.  Even if this situation did not happen, you will find better mexican food down the street at Cozumel, just as another yelper said."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here, the food was amazing (as always), but what really made the experience was the service.  We had the best service ever at a Mexican Restaurant from Gabriella, and it was her first day!  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy myself every time I go, the people are friendly and the food is good! The service is decent and the outdoor patio is great for summer!"}
{"text":"Not so good.  The beans in my burrito looked and tasted very cheap, and the burrito was very bland.  I got dragged to go here awhile ago, and gave it a try again, but still the same.  I usually eat at Nuevo Acapulco in North Olmsted.  I won't be back at \"No Senor\" again."}
{"text":"This is my third time dining here and I had to write in because reviews don't give credit where it is absolutely due. The service is quick, efficient and to the point. They have redone the entire interior and exterior and it is always extremely clean. I ordered the fajitas and my girlfriend the chimichangas. Both were fresh and flavorful. I think some of the hipsters on yelp need to realize they're not paying big money when they walk through the doors and to expect just what si señor's advertises.. authentic Mexican cuisine. 

As far as the food being bland I find this to be false. The flavor comes from the main ingredients and if you want to spice things up feel free to use one of their hot sauces. Otherwise, as in the case of my fajitas, the flavor of chicken, green bell peppers, sweet onion, guacamole, beans, cheese and sour cream with a dash of hot sauce left me satisfied. The portions are large and come out quickly.

If you want authentic classical Mexican look no further this place is awesome. Well done si señor I look forward to stopping back soon and can't wait for the weather to warm back up to enjoy one too many pitchers of margaritas. The bottom line: Try this place out if you aren't a stiff and enjoy classical Mexican!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has really gone downhill since I was here last.  Terrible service! She brought my drink when she brought my box without even an apology. This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant but the food is almost as bad as the service.

And now my boyfriend is walking around the place looking for someone that works here... We've been waiting for our check for ten minutes."}
{"text":"Have yet to have a bad meal, bad service or bad margaritas here!  Love the many choices, especially the bacon-wrapped shrimp stuffed with jalapeños and cheese. You are always greeted with a smile and your drinks will be constantly refreshed. Highly recommend this newer treat to the Kamm's Corners area, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the area for the night on our way out west, and we had a fantastic meal here. The service was superb - everyone who worked there was so friendly. Our food came quickly and was very good - exactly how we ordered it. It's a shame I won't be in this area any time again soon - highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is super friendly and the food is always perfect. Prices are not too bad either. I go here a lot and have never had an issue."}
{"text":"Service was great, waiter came to our table about 7 times in 20 min. Food was ordered and arrived in 4 min, faster than any place I've been to. The building looks brand new and very clean and the booths were comfortable. The salsa and chips were on par, a bit on the mild side, rice wasn't very tasty, but the beans were above average. I ordered the chimichangas, and they were superb. Chicken and beef was moist, topped then with some delicious guacamole and cheese. They also put coupons in all the Val-paks and town shopper ads :) Price and menu were similar to other American-Mexican places, they may have a few more items than others. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices.

I got the steak skillet and wings. Delicious!

The waitress was a bit off her game as far as service but it wasn't anything huge. She was very friendly though. :) 

We ate on the patio which was very nice."}
{"text":"I have only dined here twice, and both visits were awful, so I will never be returning for a third. 

The service was horrendous the first time I was there, and the food is not worth the high prices they charge.

The second time around was not any better. Our server was great, but the food was awful and highly overpriced. The salsa was watery, and the queso was cold and watery. I ordered an appetizer based on the photo in the menu, and when the server brought it to the table, I could not believe how much it did not resemble the picture at all. 

The Indians game was on both monitors in the dining room, but then an employee turned the monitor off that I was watching. There was also a man in a suit that kept coming in and just standing in the middle of the dining room when we were the only table left. There were people still eating throughout the rest of the restaurant, but I then asked our server what time they close. It was 9 pm, and we were told they close at 10 pm. They then turned the music that was playing up really loud. It was very clear that we were no longer welcome there.

I tried calling during lunch to speak with the manager the next day, but nobody ever answered. I will never go back, and I strongly suggest that everyone reading this avoid this overpriced establishment with extremely rude staff."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, now if they just had Chi Chi's corn cake, it would be a home-run for me!  Unlike the other Mexican restaurants that serve up mystery meat, this place actually uses real chunks of quality chicken and steak in their dishes.  Not to mention the fried ice cream for dessert, yum!  

Came here on a fluke, but I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The portions were very large, and it tasted good.  But I was hoping for a more authentic taste.  1 or 2 steps ahead of Chi-Chi's.  If you're looking for Americanized Mexican eats, then this is your place.  If you're looking for more authentic Mexican cuisine, and are a little more adventurous, keep driving East on Lorain road."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a business took over this building in Kamm's Corners and turned it into something family-friendly.  While the food is a run-of-the-mill Midwestern take on Mexican, it's decent.  The fajitas with chicken, steak, and shrimp are my favorite, and as if they weren't plentiful enough, they come with generous sides of rice, beans, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.  I had a flavored margarita there once and it tasted pretty mix-y, but it was still better than a lot of margaritas that I've had made from mixes.  The staff is friendly and the service is pretty fast -- you can sit on the patio outside or watch TV at the bar while waiting for carry out, and it's never taken more than about 15 minutes for them to prepare an order of four or five entrees to go.

I noticed that they've advertised some drink specials for sports games, but I haven't taken advantage of them yet."}
{"text":"Guacamole, salsa, and fajitas were all delicious. I've tried 2 other Mexican restaurants in the area and this one is definitely the best! Its pretty standard for your local Mexican restaurant. There wasn't a long wait on a Friday night."}
{"text":"If you like cafeteria food, you'll enjoy this bland version of Mexican food.  The should pay you to eat there & not the other way around."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Our server was almost inappropriate by the way he kept staring at my teenage daughters. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Si Senor's is my go to Mexican restaurant. Of course, you are provided with fresh corn chips and salsa. I love their salsa! I always order the Enchiladas Supremas ($10) which is their variety platter of enchiladas (chicken, ground beef, cheese, & bean) made with corn tortillas and a side of rice. It's perfect for me since I have Celiac's and need Gluten Free options (be sure to make sure the staff tells the kitchen that you need special preparation for your allergy). My family orders the chicken burritos, flautas, and fajitas (all of which they have no complaints with). The portions are large, prices reasonable, and service is friendly and fast. If you are in the mood for Mexican, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Si senor's deco is very tacky and the waiter spoke very little English. The menu did have a large variety but beware of what you order there. My boyfriend ordered the crab and shrimp  chimiconga and expected to get just that but instead the crab was imitation and not very flavorful.  I ordered the seafood fajitas.  It was very good but the menu stated it came with 4 tortilla shells but you only get three and they are half the size of a normal shell about 4 in in diameter and you only get 3. When I asked for another , I was charged 1.50 extra for it ! Also my boyfriend asked for a little extra sourcream and was also charged extra for that!.  They say its authentic but their rice has little flavor. When we received our bill it was just a old adding machine tape with numbers. Nothing was itemized and no customer copy available.  So ridiculous.  We will think twice before eating there again."}
{"text":"Clean, super fast service, friendly staff, good food and inexpensive. Who could ask for anything more."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place the first time I tried it on Taco Tuesday. I love the idea of choosing your own toppings. The place appears to be super clean, however, there was some type of food stuck on the inside of my water glass. Not appetizing.  The taco meat was pretty bad. I ordered one grilled chicken taco, bit into a bone, one ground beef taco,strange consistency.  The toppings all  seemed fresh. The rice was tasty. Cheap food but let's face it, you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"We have frequented this paticular Si Senor and have had great experiences every time. The food is awesome and cooked the same way everytime-so if you have favorites u o u know what you are getting, which i love! Margaritas are OUT OF SIGHT! Seafood is cooked very well everytime and all vegetables are very fresh. Fresh hot chips and salsa made daily- the salsa  never takes exactly the same because its fresh everday so because of jalapenos and tomatillos the heat varies-fajitas are a for sure bet- and also a cheap taco bar on tuesdays-specials everyday- try it you'll love it"}
{"text":"The service is great and super fast and the staff is friendly. The food has good flavor, but not a good value. Both my husband and I always order fajitas at any Mexican place and this place definitely had the  worst value! You have to pay for your tortillas and there wasn't even a full chicken breast in mine, I mean there was a few shreds of chicken in the pile of onions and peppers!! My bill was $47 and a huge waste!!! Very poor value! I should've taken a picture of it to see if you can search for chicken like Where's Waldo! Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Cozumel is so much better. I'm writing this from my table at si señor. I was overcharged twice... Watch out, kids meals are on the menu for $4.50 but they will charge you $4.75. Also, I had a mysterious charge of $4.99 on my bill.... Apparently the waitress saw the manager give me a side of guac (which was supposed to be included with my dinner and i never got it) so she charged me for it. Um... Not worth $1 let one $5.00.  no taste. I tried to like this place. No bueno."}
{"text":"I had the most expensive lunch the other day at Si Senor restaurant in Westlake.  My check came up to $9.18 which I paid with a credit card; however, the amount that was charged to the credit card was $24.18.  A hefty $15.00 additional to the gratuity that I left the waiter.  I have reported it to my credit card and they suggested that I give the restaurant a chance to issue me a credit.  I will be visiting the restaurant tomorrow to get my money.  In any case I will be watching my account for future unauthorized purchases and I will never step a foot in that restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very fast service!!  My margarita was Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and have never been disappointed. The food is great, and their staff is fantastic. I like that the manager always checks on us to make sure we are happy and also helps out alot when they are busy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised with some of the bad reviews on here.  We have been going to Si Señor in Westlake since they opened, and have never had anything bit a great experience.  We always comment on how great the staff is.  The servers work so hard, and are running around all helping each other out.  They could not be more friendly or accommodating.  

The food is great.  I particularly enjoy the free chips and salsa to start.  Being a hot sauce junkie, my mouth started to water the first time I saw 4 or 5 different kinds of hot sauce bottles on each table.  Honestly, that alone has kept me coming back.  Everything that we have tried, from tacos, burritos, fajitas, chicken dishes, etc have been enjoyed by us and others in our party.  About six months ago, my wife and I started a vegan diet, and are happy that we can still dine at one of our favorite places, Si Señor.  Our choices are obviously more limited now, but we still enjoy the chips and salsa, and order the vegetarian fajitas without cheese or sour cream.  

Also, don't forget to ask for a chilled mug with a salted rim when ordering a Green Lable Dos XX!"}
{"text":"Such a friendly staff, good margaritas and very filling food! If you're looking for a place during happy hour- this is it!"}
{"text":"This location is NOT closed. The original location on Detroit Rd in Westlake is closed. The food and Margeritas were great."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. My expectations after viewing the menu on online exceeded my actual experience. The food was OK, but lacked depth of flavor. I knew from the first taste of the salsa that the food would lack the true flavor of Mexican cuisine. I will continue my quest to find Mexican food as good as my dad's home cooking."}
{"text":"Nice serving sizes. They must be affiliated with the same owners of my other review Restaraunt, el jalapeño. The menus are the same and my spinach el pollo was identical. I must say much like my other review this place is a nice one to visit too."}
{"text":"We had 3 waiters...asked twice for water...45 minutes later and we still did not receive any water. It took the 30 minutes to order our food. We ended up leaving. Bad first impression and I will never go back again. Very unorganized!"}
{"text":"Food was relatively bland.  Guacamole  was fresh and tasty, but cheese and bean dips runny and cold. Service just. OK.  Overall, not impressed"}
{"text":"Great food, really slow and lousy service. And closed on Mondays and any semi significant holiday"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant with good ingredients. Would come again and would recommend very tasty!!!!!  Fire means fire here!    Service is excellent.    I  believe the waiter was back 10 times in a half hour."}
{"text":"Si Senor is FANTASTIC! It is definitely one of the main attractions in Kamm's Corner.  Try the Texana Margarita, absolutely wonderful!  Very good salsa and the burritos are my favorite.  The place is very clean with friendly staff.  If you ever have any problems, just ask for Rafa, the owner, great guy and always happy to help."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night. I had head the food here wan gross, so maybe my expectations were a little low, but the food was okay! The portions were huge! And the service was great. For a Saturday night this place wasn't too busy or over crowded. My husband dislikes Mexican fare and even he didn't think it was bad."}
{"text":"I was all ready to deduct a star for the inaccurate website (apparently all beers are not $2 on Sundays, so don't get your hopes up).  But then we were given a round of tequila shots after dinner last night that changed my mind.  Not that any of us wanted them, or even like tequila shots, but it was still a very nice gesture.  4 stars for great service!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Si Senior's since they opened, and the food has always been great.   After working in Mexico and eating un-Americanized meals, I really miss the real thing.

I recently visited Phoenix and found a fantastic place and had the same experience, but this time I took pictures.

When I visited Si Senior's, and showed the waiter exactly what I was looking for, he immediately understood what I wanted, and a fresh plate of real Mexican Tacos was served, complete with some really excellent hot sauce.

Muy Bueno Comida  !   Gracias!!"}
{"text":"Used to be great lunch, but they switched the waitress for a young waiter and it went to hell. Today was the last day we will go there. Never blame the customers because you can't get corn tortillas right."}
{"text":"A few months back my wife and I spotted Si Senor on Broadview and we just knew we would eventually make our way into the restaurant. It's advertised as authentic Mexican cuisine and I won't disagree with them. Upon entering the atmosphere seemed authentic. Mexican music, proper lighting older looking tables. But enough about that, we were greeted and seated. Immediately upon being seated we were brought chips and salsa which were pretty good. The best thing is that they have a common kids menu with both Mexican and classic dishes just in case you have a picky eater (as we do)

Their menu is pretty large. Fajitas, tacos, enchiladas. All of the classic Mexican dishes. I ordered tacos de asada, my wife ordered steak and shrimp fajitas. From ordering to being served the service was fast and friendly, the food arrived hot, and the flavors? Aw man their refried beans are delicious. My youngest even enjoyed his enchilada. The best thing about Si Senor is I believe they're family owned. It feels family owned from their friendly service to the flavors of their food. If anyone drives by si Senor I suggest you stop in. They won't disappoint"}
{"text":"As I eat my leftovers, I am still impressed with the way this place uses cilantro. I loooove cilantro and am often disappointed with the small leafy green bits in my food that don't taste like much of anything. This place KNOWS. They know the secret to cilantro and making it work in a dish without overpowering it!

I had the burrito with verde sauce and it was absolutely fantastic! This was not my favorite green sauce, but the cilantro definitely made up for that. 

The only strange thing I noticed here was that we had about five different servers. We were asked the same things multiple times because someone had already asked us moments before. It was a \"who put the pepper in the pot\" situation that got a bit old, but it didn't really take away from the experience."}
{"text":"For what it is, I think Si Senor is delicious! If it weren't so far away from me, I'd probably go much more often! 

We were immediately greeted at the door and taken to a booth in the cramped dining room. I had a margarita and wow was it a margarita. Perhaps it was that I hadn't eaten much that day and was preparing for chips and salsa, but it hit me, that's for sure. The chips and salsa were very good (yes, they were good even before the margarita)--we had a refill of them, even though we barely ate much of the second, though it was a nice option to have. :)

I had the fish tacos which were excellent. I'm always wary of fish in Mexican food--I learned that the best was to order it is in California...and that's it. Rubio's has the best fish tacos and there's no beating that, but we're not in California (thankfully), we're in Ohio. So, these tacos were tasty and the fish was pretty perfect. It flaked apart in my mouth and the sauce on them was so good that I couldn't get enough! 

Unfortunately, I ate too much of the salsa and couldn't finish my tacos, but there's nothing wrong with leftovers! This food (like most Tex Mex) reheats well!! Though beware of fish drying out (of course!) during the reheat--because I liked the sauce so much, there wasn't enough the next day as well. 

I really don't see much wrong with this place. It's standard Tex Mex and there's nothing wrong with that. Our service was also pretty fab and I couldn't complain save for the language barrier at times, but I've experienced worse in the past."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love it here!!! Especially on the margarita specials night. The food is fantastic and comes out quickly. The fajitas are a must try!! I definitely recommend trying this place out when you are having a craving for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love Si Senor. I live in the area and have eaten at Si Senor often since they opened (I'm not sure I can admit to myself how many times!!). It's an easy choice because it's casual, fast and inexpensive and there's something on the menu for everyone. The service is always good and I have never had a complaint about the food except for the fish tacos I ordered last year, which were a disappointment. I try to get something different every time I'm there . Si Senor provides generous portions and the food is to the table quickly. This is not authentic Mexican food. It's the standard American version of Mexican food so as long as you know that going in, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Decent (americanized) Mexican food (which I happen to love). Easy to get in and out of the parking lot and decent amount of parking."}
{"text":"One of my favs, great food, good portions, and friendly service. Every time I go it tastes better!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were there last night for dinner.  We just love it there. The service is always great. The food is always outstanding. My guy always gets #36 Quesadilla but goes back n forth with steak & chicken. I had for the first time their tilapia soft tacos & made use of their taco bar. Talk about AMAZING!!!! I'm definitely going to order those again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way back from Cedar point to home in buffalo, ny. We got here at about 11:30 and the place was empty (it was a tuesday). We were sat immediately and brought chips and salsa (which were very good. If you like thick salsa, you'll be disappointed. This stuff is genuine mexican salsa). 

I got the El Burrito Grande and it was every as bit of big as the name suggests. I am never one to not be able to finish a meal, but I was able to only get through half of it. It was absolutely delicious!

Unfortunately, I don't live close to this place, or I would definitely go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, tasty food, portions the size of your head.  What more could you ask for!?!?!

Found this place for a late lunch while in from out of town.  I walked out feeling absolutely uncomfortably full because I couldn't stop eating! 

Make this a stop when you are in!  And make the fried ice cream a must.  But bring friends!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I'm a HUGE fan of authentic tacos so was excited to grab some tacos on my trip to Cleveland. Well, move on. This is not authentic and the tacos are just mediocre. The waitstaff seem to not listen as well. We arrived and first ordered waters with lemon. Our waters came but no lemon. No big deal, right? So we ordered a pitcher of strawberry banana margarita to share. Then I ordered 3 tacos carnitas on corn tortillas and my two friends split a fried ice cream. Our margarita only tasted of tequila and not strawberry and banana. It was gross and gave me heart burn. The brought over the fried ice cream for the girls and 1 carnitas taco. When I order carnitas at several other Spanish/Mexican restaurant, it's usually small pieces of steak whereas steak tacos are bigger chunks. This was pulled pork. I tried asking about it and the waiter did my understand what I was saying. I asked where my other tacos were and he said you want more tacos? Clearly he missed the \"3 tacos carnitas\" when I ordered. Kind of a good thing so I could order the steak one. The tacos came and I went to the taco bar to add my condiments on it. I like mine the way they serve it usually - tomatoes, hot sauce, onions and cilantro. The tacos were edible but mediocre. The pork and the steak was really dry. I also realized they gave me flour tortillas instead of corn the 2nd I touched the tacos since they instantly fell apart. I wanted to like this place but I did not. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Now I cannot stay away from this place!  Ordered the chicken fajitas today.  Sadly they didn't come out of the kitchen blazing a steam trail behind them (bummer... I love a good food procession).  But holy smokes... These are the best tasting chicken fajitas I have had since I was in Mexico.  The flavor of the chicken is awesome and so are the grilled veggies.  Service is bad.  Put up a flare if you need something because they won't check on you once your food is delivered.  The waitstaff is usually standing behind the podium checking their cell phones or sitting outside on the patio talking on the phone."}
{"text":"Went on Cinco de Mayo...packed of course.  I have been to the Si Señor in Kamm's Corners.  I like the decor and ambience at the Kamm's Corners location better but the food at the Broadview location tasted better.  Damn, their salsa is so good.  Mild with nice cilantro flavor.  Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I challenge you to find better chicken fajitas than these.  Always great food served piping hot and with a smile.  Love SI Señor, no matter what location.  But this location serves their fajitas on the sizzling platter and I think they taste the best at this location vs the one on Lorain and the one near Independence."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to for Mexican food! Service has never let us down! Meet there often with my siblings because they love it too! The ONLY negative food experience we've had was with my daughter's kids plate. The fries were soo undercooked. Could've used another 2-3 minutes in the deep fryer. But that has been the only hiccup with their food we've had. Today I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed by this place. The chicken in the taco was really good but by the time i picked it up it was soggy and full of water/juices so that sucked. I also ordered rice and beans which lacked any flavor. I probably won't come again but the place in general is nice."}
{"text":"No Señor, just no.

I stayed in the hotel right across from this place and thought that I would come grab some food to go.  Looking at the menu I knew exactly what I wanted.  Jalapeno poppers and the Monterrey enchiladas.  When I called I specifically asked the person who picked up if they made their jalapeno poppers at the restaurant or if they were frozen.  I had a feeling... And even though she seemed annoyed she said yes, they were made at the restaurant.
Dwight Schrute: FALSE!

If they do make them in-house then they must have copied the recipe from all of the frozen ones you get at every generic bar across the U.S.  Why do I know this? Because I used to go to Wal-Mart and buy these frozen suckers on the regular.  Not to mention they weren't even warm when I ate them.  Cheese whiz type center, small ass pepper that doesn't even constitute as being a pepper and the all too familiar breading.  You can't fool me.  I lived on these during college.  

The enchiladas were pretty bad.  They tasted like they were just assembled two secs before I got to the restaurant.  Everything fell apart and all of the components tasted like they were separated instead of one cohesive dish.  The tortillas unraveled and the sauce was just red colored watered.   Everything about the meal was really under seasoned.  Then the meal came with chips and salsa.  Salsa was just salsa, but the chips tasted like old oil.  I ate 3 of them and couldn't eat anymore.  Now, look at my record on Yelp.  I rarely give 2's and I even more rarely waste food.  This place was terrible for anyone who's ever had decent Tex-Mex/Mexican."}
{"text":"We dined in at Si Senor as a family of 5 on Saturday. The food was as good as always, even though one of my children always gets a non-Mexican children's meal. There were many leftovers although I somehow managed to finish the generously portioned carnitas - they were very good, crispy, sauced, a little smoky, tender and delicious.  Our waiter did a good job of realizing the order error (it's hard for a server to know if the inside of a burrito is right before serving) and although my daughter was prepared to eat it anyhow he made sure to ask us and get it replaced, very quickly. 

Food is good, service is good and pretty fast. Chips and salsa were good and the drink specials are always pretty good. This is not a large place and we have never come when it was empty but we also have never had bad service or disappointing food. We have eaten there quite a few times and I am very comfortable with recommending it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Is it the best Mexican you'll ever have? Nah, it's not that. But it is a nice, big space that serves huge portions of solid grub with tons of seafood and veggie options There's cold draft beer and solid service and good soup and the chips and salsa are above average, and it's one of a few sit-down options in an area with mostly pub grub and fast food. We like to hit up Sí Señor when we're visiting my family in Cleveland, and I imagine that will continue. As an added bonus, SS put something decently respectable in a building that had a long history of hosting strip clubs and redneck bars. It's an improvement to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"There is no excuse for your food coming out cold/lukewarm.   Grossed me out."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Mexican place for the last 6 years or so. There has only been one time I have gone and wasnt completely satisfied with my food....but i was also very pregnant at the time, blame it on hormones. Their super burros are awesome and the servers are very attentive with quick service. I love that, esp if my kids are with me!"}
{"text":"Wow...we just did a carry out order from work and are all terribly disappointed.  First, we have eaten here several times in the past and been satisfied.  Today, nothing had any flavor.   We all had a chicken dish of some sort.  My chicken enchiladas and my friend's chicken burrito lacked any seasoning...none!!!!  Just plain shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla.  If I had not requested some queso on the enchiladas it would have tasted like nothing at all.  Rice was different too...not the same flavor or standard...was sticky and very tomato pasty.  Charro beans were very mushy and overcooked and I always look forward to those.  Sad to say we will not be visiting here any longer.  It was much better quality when they had the smaller restaurant on Dover Center and Detroit.  No longer in any way, shape or form comparable to Nuevo Aculpulco who will be getting all my Mexican business in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I live right around the corner and have wanted to check it out for awhile. We went to dinner here on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised! The ambiance was awesome! they had a mariachi band playing and a balloon guy going around to all the tables. Very fun atmosphere. As soon as we were seated someone came by with HOT chips and salsa and a server took our drink orders and food orders within 5 mins of sitting. The service we received was perfect. I got the vegie fajitas which were incredible! Maybe the best I've had honestly. My husband got tacos and a chicken burrito and had no complaints but also wasn't raving. Overall awesome Mexican spot for a fun time!"}
{"text":"Love Si señor if I could eat here every other day I would! The food is fresh and consistent, comes out fast and friendly staff every time all the time! Rafa best manger and it shows. I literally have tired almost very dish on the menu I have never been disappointed. Si señor A+"}
{"text":"Another great Latin Restaurant!  Good food but is on the spicy hot side.  Ordered Camerones that were really spicy and when waiter saw my distress brought over to me fresh sliced avocado and it dulled the taste immediately!  Great service and pricing!"}
{"text":"yes, another Yelper was so correct... if you want the real thing, come to the Southwest ... but, for NE Ohio, these guys did fine... on a weekend night, service was actually an A! attentive prompt appropriate friendly ... the food on a \"Midwest US\" grading scale: Flautas A, quesadilla grande B, pollo loco B, charro beans A-, guacamole A-... less than $20 / person including tip... a very positive experience this far north of the border!"}
{"text":"Great standard mexican food and margaritas.  My older teenage children loved the nacho salad.  The cheese enchalata and carnitas enchalata were my favorites.  The margarita needed a bit more tequila but the price was right.  We will be back. New favorite mexican restaurant on the west side."}
{"text":"Should have stayed at old location--prices up, staff lacadazical, even at slower time.  Arrived at 5pm and by time seated was told too late for happy hour--2 to 5 pm.   Asked for one of the board specials at front door.  Was told OK but when check came, got charged higher price.  Explanation:  board was lunch price but not identified as such.  Took a manager to resolve.  Chips were stale and salsa just plain unedible.  We now have a different Mexican restaurant that hasn't let a bit of success go to it's head."}
{"text":"Love this place. Chops and salsa are outstanding, and the staff zooms around like little bees. Friendly, affordable, great food."}
{"text":"Fast service, Great margaritas, and awesome chips? What else could be better? Besides the fact that you can tell this was an old Pizza Hut.  Tuesdays are 99 cent tacos, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Dine in is delicious  and fast, but I will say that carry out service is not that great. The food was not very fresh tasting, also I bought the queso appetizer and was very dissapointed with the size of it."}
{"text":"It was an ok experience. Busy night...our waiter was very busy and we understood very nice gentleman though! I just wish the used more authentic ingredients in their food. I got enchiladas supremas. One cheese,bean,chicken,and beef. The cheese i feel should be ACTUAL CHEESE not queso. The \"beef\" was not shredded beef it was the exact same consistency as taco bell meat. Processed, ground beef. We got a pitcher of margarita. I weigh 120 lbs and had three my bf had 3 neither one of us was buzzed....weak marg. Service was good when it actually came around but it really just came down to the food and drink not being up to par."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Mexican restaurant in town !!! The food is awesome, the atmosphere is great and the service is second to none !!!! If you want great Mexican fare then this is the place to go. You won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"So, I went to an after-work gathering for some folks birthdays last night; I have to say, I was impressed. 

The service was really amazing. The gentleman who took care of us was johnny on the spot all the time! Our water was constantly refilled, he was really super-cordial, and always there with a joke and a smile. The food was very good and plentiful. I got the Pollo Loco, and it was great! My co-workers got some amazing drinks that they said were wonderful, and most got the make-your-own taco combos, and really loaded up and got some tasty stuff:)

The prices are good and the parking is plentiful. The restaurant is midway down Sperry Road down amongst their \"restaurant row\". 

So, if you ask me if I'd go back to this wonderful place with it's exceptional food, I'd simply say \"Si Senor!\""}
{"text":"Went there because I am trying to find good Mexican food in the area. Menu is quite large, plenty of selection. I had the two burrito meal with rice on the side, one chicken and one beef burrito. Both were just OK, nothing special but nothing that stood out from the crowd. I felt like  the beef was canned as it did not taste fresh enough to be anything but. Chicken tasted fine, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce on top tasted OK. My girlfriend got the Chile Relleno. It was not spicy and had a lot of cheese in it. It was just OK, nothing special. Atmosphere was nice, the restaurant was relatively empty but service was slow - except that we got our meal very quickly after ordering. I think this is because there was only one waiter on duty. Overall, if we're in the area, we might be back, but will be trying other place nearby."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and the food was very good and the margarita's were even better! Will definitely go back. The service was quality and the restaurant was clean and roomy."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch with the kids. The chips were ok and I added cheese dip for the table. I ordered a basic quesadilla with grilled chicken and rice. Both were about average. My husband loves the taco bar- many options to choose from. The kids had chicken strips and hot dogs and seemed to enjoy their meals. But the bill was quite expensive. $58 and my husband and I both ordered water for our drinks. Yeah that's way too much for average food. Don't think I'll be stopping again for that price. :/"}
{"text":"One of my fave date night restaurants. The service is amazingly fast and the food is good. Some of the best free chips and salsa. They have a fun patio and the music is upbeat. The meals are very cheap, but the quality is high. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Place was clean enough and service was good. Food was bland and boring!"}
{"text":"Meh..
It was exactly the same as a dozen other mediocre Mexican restaurants in town. The portions were large and the food was cheap but it was underwhelming. The fresh squeezed margarita was just average. The decor is exactly what you would expect and the service was efficient. If someone really wanted to go I wouldn't put up a fight but I wouldn't return on my own accord. You live and you learn and hey, I had a coupon!"}
{"text":"Their chipotle chicken dish is delicious.  This is a pretty typical mexican restaurant.  Nothing too fancy, fair prices, and big portions.  Nice place to go get some margaritas and decent grub."}
{"text":"Taco bell is around the corner, the prices are the same, and the food is better.  Live Mas.
Cheap margs... all mix + no tequila = gross.  Not a fan.
I hope I get the courage to try it again because I want it to be good.  For now they're 0 for 1."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. The fried ice cream was horrible. The corn flakes were stale and the \"honey\" tasted fake or old. The salsa was tomato juice.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars because the service was decent.  He had a difficult time with English but that's understandable."}
{"text":"Whats more romantic than tacos on valentines day? 

While everybody was having Italian i decided that my valentines day would consist of tacos and rice and everything in between. I have passed Si Senor multiple times and finally convinced hubby to stop in.

First, the outside looks small, but its actually pretty comfortable inside. Its decorated with \"authentic\" mexican decor. Lots of loud colors and bottles of Jarritos and Corona. My waiter had a crazy mustache which made me excited for the food ( im weird).

We immediately got served some chips and salsa, drink orders taken. I was impressed with the speed of service.

I celebrated v-day with a nice big pina colada...i swear there was enough alcohol in there for me to be completely sterile afterwards. It was only $6 so i cant complain because i sure got my moneys worth.

I ordered the Fiesta De La Casa which was shrimp, steak and chicken fajitas. They came out PIPPING hot, and super fresh. I was pleased with the amount i was given for the price.  We also got some chimichangas and enchiladas. All in all the food was seasoned with authenticity, served on hot plates which allowed you to enjoy your food before it got cold. 

From sit down to finish it was about an hour which on V-day is AWESOME sauce! I would be back just because the service and staff were great, the food was good and resonably priced."}
{"text":"Family friendly, great prices, the menu is vast and the margaritas are strong! The bacon wrapped shrimp is fabulous! I love the chicken nachos and the fish tacos. They have daily specials and room for a large party."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch at Si' Senor in Westlake was Ok. The restaurant has a fun and festive look, nice job of updating the dinning room. The food options are your typical Mexi-American selection of tacos, burrito, fajitas with most of the combo's you might want with Beef, Chicken, Shrimp.

We were seated immediately in a clean booth and chips &a salsa were brought over quickly. The salsa was Ok with nice flavor while the chips were bland at best, wondering if they a bought from Sysco or another distributor? Our margarita were good with plenty of salt on the rim of the Hugh fishbowl glass with plenty of ice. 

My wife went for the Shrimp Fajitas while I decided to try the Camarones a la Diabla. The positive of our lunch includes nice portions with good char on the fajitas plate. There was truth in advertising on the Diabla - some honest to goodness heat and spice! Think a drank more water than margarita with lunch. We were served two foil wrapped servings of tortillas, one serving was warm and pliable while the second set was kinda crunchy. 

I was hoping for a bit more attention to detail. The food has good taste and the location is super easy for most westsiders. Our server was good, a bit fast taking the remaining chips (mediocre) and salsa (good) when bussing the table and dropping of the bill.  There are no shortage of Mexican restaurants to choose from in the CLE and can be a good option with a bit of fine tuning and attention to detail."}
{"text":"I came here on St. Patrick's Day to celebrate a birthday. I kinda hit all the marks, right?

The service was good. Wait staff was pleasant - greeted us as soon as we came in. Checked on us frequently without being obtrusive. 

We ordered two of their house fajitas to split for four people. The flour tortillas are made on the premises. You can order corn tortillas in place of or in addition to the flour tortillas for an upcharge. The corn tortillas are also made in house. The food came out quickly. Shrimp were big, the chicken slices had some char, and the steak was easy to eat. The onions were caramelized and the peppers were cooked all of the way through.

There's a salsa bar if you want something different from the regular mild salsa brought to the table with chips.

For the holiday, men wore green bow ties and women wore St. Patrick's Day themed headbands. 

For the birthday person, our server brought out a serving of fried ice cream with a sombrero and the wait staff sang a song. There was more than one birthday that night."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks as this place was right outside of my hotel. The overall vibe of the place is nice but that's about it. I won't go into detail but I didn't really care for it. Who puts club soda in a margarita?"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this kind of Mexican and would probably only give it a two if it wasn't one of the favorites of friends of ours. The place was jammed and was turning over quickly. There was one waitress working pretty much the whole restaurant, so the service was a little slow, but the food came out lightning fast. 
The food is fine, but nothing exciting, kind of bland, kind of canned, kind of boring. They have lots of parking, it's good for kids and there is hot sauce on the table. Those are all good things."}
{"text":"Very good food at a good price. The staff was friendly and accommodating. It was pretty busy when we went your typical loud dining room. I expected to wait but we got right in, the waiter showed up in a hurry to take our drink orders and then gave us plenty of chips and salsa. It was our first time here and he gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu without us feeling rushed or abandoned. We started with a Margarita (Peach) that's what the wife wanted. I expected your typical watered down frozen concoction but it was quite good and not watered down at all. They offer them on the rocks or blended. For the main course I ordered the #37 which was 2 shredded beef burritos with a spicy blanco queso sauce on top, and re-fried beans. It was very good and I could only eat one so I took the rest home. My wife ordered the #39 which was 4 enchiladas 2 ground beef and 2 chicken mole style, rice and beans. I know 4 enchiladas sounds like allot but they are on the smaller side so it is like getting 2 full size ones. They were also very good, the mole was some of the better I have had.  Oh yeah if you want to wait a long time for your food dont go here it came out lightning fast and lava hot.  I had been going to El Rodeo for a while but gave this newer place a try and it was a hit. I will most likely be coming back here from now on."}
{"text":"Just like mama used to make it. 

Paco's customer service reflects the ingenuity and duality of the American spirit, and the working class's tenacity in the face of the ever-changing service industry. 

Also the tacos are great.


My 3 friends and myself walked in, as we do every Tuesday, and were greeted by one of the lovely hostesses who then led us to our usual place in the corner that overlooks the whole seating area. We only had to wait seconds before our drinks were ordered and delivered, and our food was on its way. Per 'Taco Tuesday' tradition, we ordered two tacos each, myself having the soft beef, as well as a fried ice cream each. With a water the bill came to $7.50, which was well worth it."}
{"text":"Very clean for a Mexican food restaurant. When we walked in we immediately noticed the cleanliness and smells as well.

Lunch time margaritas for $1.99 and value priced Mexican food is quite the steal.

The menu is full of items and platters. The alcohol menu is a little small but $2.00 beers is also a steal to go with the cheap menu prices.

The flautas are fresh and amazing. The tamales were pretty good as well. An outside patio for those amazing days when you want to enjoy the sun.

All in all an amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here until today. Pushy server pressuring us to order. Food came out decently fast, but we were one of three tables in entire restaurant. Food was lukewarm at best and lacking flavor. Drinks weren't refilled. Server disappeared for at least 20 minutes. A second server had to bring us boxes and our bill. Not excited to return."}
{"text":"I love 'authentic' Mexican - better known as cheap and quickly served Mexican.  But this place is below par to it's competitors.  While there is never a wait which is really nice, I think there is a reason for that. 

So it's Mexican - of course when I go I want a Margarita.  I would say they are just average?  I barely taste the tequila and I barely taste the flavor I choose of the day?  And there are never any pitcher or daily specials.  *(maybe they are but then my server never tells me about them). 

Then the food.  It's not bad, but I have definitely experienced better.  Things seem to be flavorless and WAY OVERPRICED.  I order a la carte items a lot because usually it is a night before the bars or I am more going for the drinks, chips and the company.  The a la carte taco's are huge!!!! but again flavorless.  

If I have a choice I would pick a competitor but if I am going out in West Park I can deal - I just wish the staff was more fun and friendly and the food and drinks gave me a little more flavor."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Perfect place for family dinner. Always friendly staff. Very good food. Prices are great. The queso dip is the absolute bomb! Probably the best thing ever created. Cozy and comfortable seating. Great place overall."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am greeted by smiling faces EVERY time I walk in.  I always sit at the bar, and everyone is so nice. The manger always brings me their \"real\" salsa and I couldn't ask for more. Look.. we're not in Mexico, I'm not in a bikini, and I'm not eating lengua or drinking mezcal, but as an L.A. native. I love this place."}
{"text":"Haha... well hello, where do I even start. Just the whole visit to this restaurant was... off. We stayed at the Courtyard right behind it and for the convenience sake, we went in to get couple of drinks. Ordered a fresh squeezed margarita with a shot of Herradura and I feel terrible for my be-loved Herradura; I am so sorry for wasting you honey! 

1. Since when do people water down premium tequila fresh squeezed Margarita with Soda water...? I have never ever tried a margarita in my life that calls for soda water! Is this like a Ohio thing? (Came visit from out of town) Maybe... I stopped drinking that one and asked for one without soda water. She looked at me weird so I assume that is how people drink margarita? 

2. The bartender girl... maybe I read her wrong but I thought she was on something. I mean do your thing but I felt like I have to rush and be quick with her because she was non stop moving even though the bar was not packed. 

3. We clearly was not aware that the closing time was 10 pm and we ordered one more drink at 10:10pm-ish. If the case was that us ordering one more drink would be a problem, why did you not tell us that you cannot serve anymore or all together just not make us a drink? She fixed us two drinks and then said the restaurant was closing and that we gotta go. Gave us a Styrofoam cup so that we could leave. What the? Why?

 Did not eat so cannot comment on food but meh, do not sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Though the food has slipped slightly, Si Senors is still the best most authentic Mexican on the westside since Mi Pueblos went out of business. At least a restaurant I would dine in. 
The cheese on the chilli relleno was home made I was told after commenting on it. The server was attentive and knowledgeable. The food was brought out quite quickly. No complaints at all. The price is the real difference between here and a trip south of the border."}
{"text":"Hate to be a party pooper, but this place is very run of the mill Tex Mex.  It's not bad. I have had much worse Mexican. But by no means is it authentic or exceptional here. 

All of the items you expect at reasonable prices. Service is good. Potions are large. 

Maybe I'm a Mexican food snob. But really; people, GET OUT A LITTLE MORE!"}
{"text":"only go between 2-5pm mon- fri

the happy is the best deals around

4.50 margarita giant
1.50 tacos and taco bar


typical bill is 8-9$ - perfect lunch at work opportunity"}
{"text":"Good Mexican. Nice patio. Good nachos and salsa.  I would give this 4 stars had the following now happened. A blind man came soliciting through the patio and the entire restaurant for money. This is not appropriate in a restaurant. When I told the restaurant staff, they did nothing. I am not sure if it's because they don't speak English and didn't I understand me or they allow people to solicit their patrons. I was appalled."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Restaurant! The service is pretty good and the food and margaritas are AMAZING!!! Try the Mahi Mahi grilled fish tacos for a healthy option!"}
{"text":"This is no where near tex mex, chi chi's or Taco Bell status. I love mexican food, not tex mex and this is real Mexican. Service is great, never had to wait. Prices are as cheap as they can be. I don't mind paying for good food. I've never spend more then $20 there at lunch time and we have always brought left overs home. Dinner is just as good! We usually get the steak or chicken fajitas and have never been disappointed. Like I said the portions are huge, enough to split. The decor is pretty cool, kinda the same as the rest of the mexican places, but overall nice. Salsa and chips pretty good, no complaints. Another plus is the patio, awesome for spring and summer. Long island iced teas and margaritas are always delish! Had an issue with the pitcher of long island iced tea once and the waiter was more then happy to bring us another one. If your ever in the area is a must that you stop."}
{"text":"We had a wide variety of dishes. The flautas and el tapito were just delectable"}
{"text":"I came on Taco Tuesday and the place was jammed.  The food was just as we expected.   Sure, there are little screw ups here and there and the service is a little slow right now.   You can expect that for a place that relocates and triples in size and has to hire a ton of staff.  

I was a regular at the old place and sure the new location lost the homey feel.  After all this is a for-profit business and you can't blame them for the move (their old location is for sale by the landlord) The old staff brought me a shot of tequila to celebrate some good news. 

You won't leave here unhappy unless you have a bad attitude."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and very well decorated! We were greeted promptly and shown to our seats with drink orders taken. We had drinks quickly and our orders taken too. I ordered lunch fajitas and my meal came but had to wait on the tortillas. It was worth the few minutes for them to make my flour tortillas as they were fresh and amazing with flavor. I also LOVED their guacamole as it was simple but fresh!"}
{"text":"Food is good Mexican not great, they do have a great lunch special everyday and the happy hour price of pretty much a $1.99 for every thing is good. However it only from 11-4. Service has always been very good. If you really want great Mexican try Luchitas or Mi Pueblo, but SI Señor is a nice place to dine."}
{"text":"Its a day-glo orange building!! That should be worth a three star rating alone.
Okay seriously, nice size menu about sixty lunch/dinner options.  Unless you are with the person who can not decide easily.  Serve was very good, but Monday was a very slow day here.

The salsa was very mild and white cheese dip very really thin and had little peppers mixed in it.  The texana margarita was very much worth extra dollar.  The selections in my party all were prepared well and large portions.  The enchilladas racheros had a nice mole sauce on them with cheese and onions (mole sauce could have been a little stronger flavor and more sauce too).  The two chicken were better than the two ground beef.  They serve a burrito fajita that is the size of a large plate, its about the size of a loaf of bread and does not come with anything else, but lots of chicken.  The regular burritos meal were covered with roja sauce and plenty of food to take home.  The mexican rice is a little different with peas and more seasoning.  

Definitely worth another stop, kept thinking about supa poblana.  Never had it but sounds good. Most lunchs were $5.99 and dinners $9-14."}
{"text":"Texan living in Detroit, and this was better than any of the Mexican food we've had there. It has been the closest approximation to tex mex that I've found in the Midwest. Had the chicken with rice and it was extremely flavorful. Also, almost no Mexican places in Michigan serve queso and I was pleased to find a good queso on their menu. The salsa was very tasty, too.

Will definitely return when we come back to Cleveland..."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is really great, food is good, free chips are great!. I m not sure about the other food haven't tired it but want too."}
{"text":"This place is situated in one of the oldest buildings in Kamm's Corners, and it's cozy and pleasant inside and on the patio.  The menu offers many items not available at typical Mexican-American Restaurants (i.e., they have some actual Mexican foods, like tamales, mole poblano, cazuelada, and burros).  Their salsas are also more traditional, and quite tasty.  Apart from that, they have all the items one would demand of a typical Mexican place.  I'm not sure if the staff were related, but their interactions and comfort with each other led me to feel like they were a family, running a business together.  There were no eye rolls when i asked for a highchair, which was nice.  

I gave them an extra star for the traditional Mexican Items, but There are a couple of things that could be better:
1.  Their menu is a bit pricey for the type of food.  Most Mexican places are in the single dollar sign range for Yelp, but their menu is full of $10-15 items.
2.  They don't have any draft beers, only bottles.
Still, it's a great place to enjoy a meal with friends on a summer night."}
{"text":"Love this place.food is great.not to spicey.its perfect.if you don't want to dine in they have taco Tuesday and they are so good.you can get chicken or beef ,hard or soft..margaritas aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Si Senor in actuality should be known more as No Senor.  I love to review an establishment with great detail when it is a positive experience, however I feel that a negative review does not require great detail to convey poor service, sub-par food quality, and overpriced items on menu - all of which could be checked-off during my visit to this 'Mexican restaurant'.   I did not consult yelp reviews before stepping in here, and gosh I was so wrong to not have done that.  The wait staff are borderline rude so to say let alone the inattentive nature of their service.  The waitstaff tending to our table seemed to not care for what he does and I noticed similar frustrated faces on surrounding patrons being served by other waitstaff.   The food quality is nothing to write home about - in fact could be equated to a frozen Mexican boxed dinner nuked in the microwave.  

I sure hope Si Senor can turn things around, it is located near a major intersection and if its management can truly bring on their game in quality and service, Si Senor's future can be very bright - IMHO."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere good food great service Taco Tuesday is great $1.25 a taco you go to salad bar and add what you want great drinks margaritas are good"}
{"text":"So sad. We used to love this place, but over the last year the service & food has really gone hill. The last 2 times we were there the waitress took our order & never bothered to come back.  We even had to ask the hostess if she could find our check.  The food also wasn't good.  The \"salsa ranchero\" on the enchiladas looked & tasted more like ketchup.  I've given them several chances in hopes that they were just having a rough patch, but it looks like the subpar food & non-existent service are here to stay. 

They are getting 2 stars because at least the balloon guy was great!"}
{"text":"The freshest ( I know it's not a word but oh my gosh) they have the best margarita I have ever had!  The food is amazing!  The service from David was amazing! They make their tortilla shells right in the dining room!  You can watch!  Amazing!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time since they opened here. We got seated immediately. There was a party of four of us. It seemed like a took a little bit for the table service to get themselves to acknowledge our table, once the serving staff got going they were average. We asked for seperate checks and got them on the same bill and then they confused our checks after they explained whose bills were whose. 
     Onto the food, i had gotren the vegetarian spinach platter #81, it was very tasty. The wife had the taco salad and the shell wound up being soggy almost mush like. My cousins come here all the time and theyve had good experiences."}
{"text":"Chimichanga special for lunch at $4.99. Can't beat that.  And they have wifi.....tacotaco! Frequent here for lunch and always great!"}
{"text":"In town for a wedding used Uber Eats to order. 

Wings: slightly below average. They didn't give me any dipping sauce. And the wings were soggy. 

Spinach quesadilla: slightly soggy but wife thought it was tasty. 

Quick delivery"}
{"text":"Great good and great service.  I have no idea why anyone would be writing bad reviews.  The servers are so polite and always smiling and the owners are great people.  The food is delicious and we go back time and time again.  I would recommend to anyone and I always do."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because it meets all of my expectations - quick service, warm and delicious food, plenty of chips of salsa, and bright decor.  I've rarely had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. The staff is almost always friendly and efficient. The food is exactly what I want and expect every single time.  My favorite dish is enchiladas.  My husband really enjoys the chile relleno. I have no complaints about this place and it will continue to be my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went to this Si Senor location recently.  Service was prompt and the food was as expected. The salsa was ok, a little runny in my opinion. I enjoyed my fajitas and appreciated that they were able to take out the mushrooms.  The beans and rice could've been flavored a bit more, but overall, I was satisfied with my meal.  My husband had no complaints about his chimichangas. I particularly enjoyed the queso dip and would recommend ordering that or the guacamole as an additional dip for your chips.  We sat on the inside, but there is also a patio area that is not too close to Detroit Rd so it seemed like it would be an enjoyable option. So why the 3 stars?  There were just a few small differences compared to my local Si Senor restaurant. Again, the food is good and will likely meet your expectations. I would return if I was in the area, but for my next Mexican craving, I'll be returning to the Kamms location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the food but I didn't. My husband and daughter didn't enjoy their food either. My daughter said her quesadilla tasted weird and the cheese was gross. My husband tasted and he agreed. The chicken in our food seemed low quality. None of us finished anything or even half."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday during happy hour is the best!  We wish happy hour was longer....it ends at 5 but you get some great deals on drinks.  In Tuesday's the tacos are all half off.  They bring the taco with just meat in it and you get to load them up with toppings from the \"taco bar\"  I like it because you can make them your own.  Everyone who works there is supper nice.  Only complete is that the draft beers are way over priced if it's not happy hour.  Also what happy hour ends at 5, people are just getting off work at 5.  They should end happy hour at 6 like most places."}
{"text":"Lime green walls, oh my!

As close to authentic as one will get outside of Mexico or Painesville. Flautas were not the tiny cigar size one gets at most places but the actual almost burrito sized. Guacamole could have used a little more cilantro, but that's a personal preference. Rice was just rice. Let's face it, the only way to season rice is to cook it in chicken stock, and that kinda becomes an issue for vegetarian/vegan peeps. Speaking of, there's a pretty large section of the menu dedicated to that diet style. Portions are huge, and the prices reasonable ($10-15). Xangos (fried cheesecake) was enormous. Definitely not for one person.

Service was excellent! Place is clean; the parking somewhat odd."}
{"text":"I hope they don't try and build a wall around this place because we love them here. In all seriousness though Sí Señor has amped up their game since they have moved to the new Sperry location. The interior is new and vibrant. No longer do you feel like you're in Pizza Hut anymore. The patio is large and very nice to sit at. 

Now, the Piece de Resistance!!!
They are pressing fresh corn and flour tortillas right next to the taco bar! That's right I said fresh pressed tortillas and taco bar in the same sentence. Now if they would only get a Taco Truck out on the street maybe I could get Chas M to come eat some tacos.  The food has always been top notch but since the move I feel they have been using a better blend of spices or more seasoning when prepping their proteins.

The front of the house is always very pleasant and accommodating and they always have been. Quick, clean, great tasting food and friendly service are the keys to any successful restaurant, this is why we keep returning year after year."}
{"text":"Three visits and lots of dishes and all have been excellent.  The service, though, is what makes it tops.  Extremely friendly and courteous.  We've never had to ask for anything.  Water, more napkins and refills just quietly appear.   

The shrimp fajitas are succulent.  These are jumbo shrimp, juicy and flavorful with a hint of lime and butter. The chicken chimi is stuffed with a grilled chicken breast, not shredded chicken.  And, as another person posted, the seasoning is spot on.  Unlike some Tex-Mex places, the food here feels as though someone lovingly and painstakingly prepared it to order.  

Quickly becoming my favorite Mexican."}
{"text":"Food is decent but never consistent.   Last time I went there I ordered the steak fajitas.   I got chicken fajitas and when I told the waitress, she basically said can't u just eat the chicken do u really want me to get you steak instead.  No I just ordered the steak, but really had my heart set on chicken thank u waitress for showing me the error of my ways.  Too many great Mexican restaurants in this area to come back here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few different times with my husband. We are huge mexican food fans. My husband is very picky (in a good way) about his salsa and he has never been disappointed when we have gone here. The hubs typically orders the chicken fajitas and I get the Al Pastor tacos...both are so tasty! Service is great, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food here is always delicious- try the carnitas! Huge margaritas and lots of vegetarian options. The owners are awesome and the staff always takes great care of us. Our favorite spot in Westpark!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I got the fajitas combo and there is no seasoning on the meat or veggies. The guac is runny and off color and the chips taste like cardboard. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried again, it's just not good Mexican food. Taco Tuesday sounded enticing then I ate a wet taco so drenched it dripped a puddle onto my plate. Salsa & chips are both weak. Prices are fair but I'd prefer to make Mexican at home. No bueno."}
{"text":"I loved this place and went almost once a week.  The service was still awesome and the salsa is still amazing.  I still would drink big vats of it.  However, the food this time was horrible.  I went with my parents, brothers, sister-in-law and nephews.  We went because we had a larger group and service is usually quick.  
Half of our group ordered the fish taco special, others had the steak fajitas.  The fish (no clue what kind of fish it was)  was very fishy and had that distinct old smell.  The \"homemade\" tortillas tasted moldy.  The steak was incredibly dry and the meal was just overall disappointing.   My brothers, both visiting from out of town, could not believe how crowded the place was, or that they sometimes serve decent food.  Nobody finished their meals.
It was so disappointing and I hope not an indication as to what type of place Si Senor is going to become."}
{"text":"Me definitely thinks not! How goes this place get so crowded?! oh wait, they give you mass amounts of liquor so that by the time you get your food, anything tastes good. The dinners are overpriced for the selection, and the portions are not sufficient at all. I was extremely let down. There was a soccer tourney here while we dined, and that just made this experience dreadfully awful. Cleveland cops were sitting next to us getting their drink on, you know, repping our city. Ugh I felt like I could get better food out of a frozen meal from Giant Eagle. The rice was not fresh at all, and the seafood tacos, well, they sucked."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times over the years and have never had a bad experience. The food is excellent, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are fair. Very highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Four walked in around 5:30 on a Sunday before Game 2 of the Finals without any wait.  

Everyone ordered the hard or soft tacos options since we al wanted to try the build your own taco bar.  Chips and salsa complimentary.

I opted for a carnitas, steak, al pastor and chorizo. Note: I'm a hungry, but average 28yo male. Four tacos was too much for me.

The tacos were good, the taco bar was cool, and the margaritas looked fine. I wish they had Mexican cola.

Lotsa parking and right off I-90. Also have a location in Kamms Corners."}
{"text":"I am pretty convinced I will never find a better Mexican restaurant in the area. Si Senor has never disappointed me, especially the Cleveland location. I have been to the Westlake location a couple times and the wait is always long. I always get a table immediately with this location. The patio is outstanding and a perfect place to go for drinks in the summer. 

The margaritas here are the best in the area and the menu is huge! The free chips and salsa are terrific and the staff is friendly and attentive. My glass is never empty and the food is brought out pretty quick! Overall, excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly rude, hostesses especially. Everyone has an attitude problem and doesn't want to work. We waited 1 hour and 45 min for a table that was supposed to be ready in 40 min tops. Food is mediocre and they never bring dishes out at the same time so nobody eats at the same time. Totally done with this place. I recommend a place where you aren't going to be treated like an annoyance and more like a paying customer."}
{"text":"They're back, baby! It had been a while since our last visit since they seemed to slip in quality. But the fantastic eats served up by my old favorite, Si Senor, made me oh, so happy once again! The food was 5-star but service was slow. Can't wait to go back for more...and don't get me started on the fresh, homemade tortillas...! Yum!"}
{"text":"Without question, best mexican restaurant on the Westside!  Drinks are excellent. Food is amazing. My husband and I get shrimp dishes a lot and the shrimp Si Senor serves is top notch, definitely as good as the high end seafood restaurants I've eaten at!  Service is excellent as well. I would recommend Si Senor to anyone and everyone that wants amazing, authentic Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Went there because I was in a hurry and was not disappointed! Service was super fast and the food was good."}
{"text":"Just picked up nachos to go with salsa on the side so they didn't get soggy on the 3 minute trip home...got home...no cheese in the $12 nachos...very disapointed...how can  you have nachos with no cheese....not very happy at all....totally overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday because I had a coupon from Val-pak and thought I'd try it.  It was just ok.  I don't think I'll be going back.  The dining area was so loud that my grandson and I couldn't hear each other talk.  He's only 9 and noticed how quick we got our food.  It definitely was microwaved and brought out just a few minutes after we ordered.  Parts of my burrito were a little cold while other parts were really hot.  I have to say the waitress was nice. I was surprised how crowded it was getting so people must like it in the area but to me it was just ok and super loud and noisy."}
{"text":"Okay, Mexican food. Wide variety. Nice outdoor eating area. Good for groups. I have went 5 times and have yet to find anything outstandingly wonderful. It's pretty good but no where great. Bathrooms are clean, same with the over all restaurant. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I love si senor.  The staff is always friendly, service is fast and accurate, and the food is well worth the price.  Occasionally, the Chili rellenos are a bit tinny, but nothing that can't be overlooked after a 46 oz monster margarita.  Bring a habanero salsa option, and you will be well beyond comparison to any Tex-mex restaurant in the area.  Best to you all!"}
{"text":"First time visiting, and the experience was HORRIBLE. My son & I each had an entree and a soda. Service was extremely slow. When the waiter brought over the bill, it was over $50!!!! He had entered drinks for another table to my check. I actually had to argue to have the charge taken off!  Later, both my son & I got sick. Never again.
From now on, we stick to Don Ramon."}
{"text":"Went again and again servers couldn't be bothered and botched drink order. Never again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the area! For one, many Mexican places will put refried beans on their vegetarian menu but they cook them in lard. This place does not. Very vegetarian and vegan friendly. The service is friendly and the colorful surroundings are traditional but not overwhelming. This place appreciates their customers and it shows."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant around!  Always my number one choice.  Chicken fajitas are my staple!  Love sitting on the patio in the summertime!  And who doesn't love margaritas!???"}
{"text":"Good food and decent service. This restaurant is similar to many other mexican restaurants in the area. A lot of the same food and prepared about as well as most similar places, but I like it anyways."}
{"text":"was greeted right away at the door and seated promptly. Service was great, very attentive and answered all of our questions. My sister was with us who has a few special needs and they were great accommodating her.
Food was great, plenty of everything....and we ordered from the lunch menu and there was still lots.
The only complaint is I would of liked a little more sauce on my enchiladas."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go as often as we can. Consistent, great service, amazing food and enjoyable atmosphere. I love the patio in the summer. Fajitas are the best. Their Sopa De Mariscos is phenomenal. Great Mahi Mahi tacos, steak quesadilla is the size of a pizza and the best chips and salsa around. Don't forget the colossal fried ice cream. Enough for 4 people. Even when we sneak in a half hour before closing, they greet us with a huge smile. I just love this place... One negative: It's not low calorie. Probably why I love it so much..."}
{"text":"-A Mediocre Mexican Meal-

Ever since I moved to Broadview Heights, Sí Señor has always caught my eye. It looked like a fun place and rarely seemed empty. After going there, I have to admit that my experience was overwhelmingly mediocre.

It's hard to avoid this place catching your eye, the loud colors allow this restaurant to stand out, especially in the sunny parts of the year. It almost has an allure to it that draws you in. The inside of the restaurant is very similar, bright walls and colorful decorations. Somehow the decorations that line the walls and hang from the ceiling have a dated and cheap feel to them. We went later in the evening, so the interior lights seemed dim and the colorful walls began to even strain my eyes with their vibrant color.

I have no qualms with the staff here, everyone I encountered or interacted with was polite, attentive, and were extremely quick with taking orders and getting food and drinks to the table. I swear that I did not see a single staff member without a smile on their face, and that deserves some major credit.

Unlike the friendly and fast staff, the food disappointed me. I got the Burritos Mexicanos, which consisted of one beef burrito and one chicken burrito (each containing beans and topped with cheese, lettuce, and a slice of tomato), and a side serving of Mexican rice. This is quite similar to a dish I get at nearly every Mexican restaurant, but somehow this one was blander than bland, and the chicken was fairly dry. Nothing stood out about the food that would warrant me to go back.

I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, because the staff was fantastic and the service was quick, but if you're looking for flavorful Mexican food, this wouldn't satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"This will be a \"hard to believe\" review. Si Senor has the best Mexican cuisine in town, but, they do well with gringo food, as well! Try getting a dozen of the chicken wings (blue cheese side) and enjoy! Then there's the bar...oh boy!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican in the Westlake , N. Olmsted area.  Tasty food with a nice selection of frozen margaritas with great service.  Warm welcome at the door. Fun place. Popular with the new location."}
{"text":"Awesome to have such an Authentic Mexican Restaurant nearby!
The Staff is Super, Food comes out Fast and is Terrific. We have tried many different menu offerings and all have been Superb! The Fajitas de la Casa are our favorite! Don't forget to try the Margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and been here twice food is good margaritas are above average and the service is good."}
{"text":"I visited Si Senor for thirsty Thursday around 5. The restaurant was fairly large with the typical Mexican restaurant decor. We were surprised Si Senor was empty and we attributed it to other patrons not being off work. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. It took awhile for us to order because the menu has a lot of options. After much contemplation we settled on chimichangas and nachos. While we were waiting for our food one of the workers was cleaning with a VERY STRONG cleaner. I started to get a headache because the cleaner was so strong. It's good that Si Senor cleans, but they should not do it when patrons are present. The food took about 20 minutes which was surprising because the restaurant was empty. The food was nothing special. It wasn't good but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that it used to be a seedy strip club and then it was Kilbanes bar.  Unfortunately they took out the stage and greasy stripper pole.  The smell of pee from Kilbanes is gone wich is a nice touch!  The food was OK, margaritas had very little booze in em.  Service was super slow but salsa was good.  Just down the road is Mi Pueblo...just go there..its way more authentic and cheaper!  Ariba!"}
{"text":"When they first opened on Detroit Road they were excellent. The they started to slide a bit. Not as good flavor wise.  Then they moved to the Sperry Road location and I think they're just pushing food out. It's just ok now.  The taco bar is lacking."}
{"text":"This is my second time at si Senor and I love it. The atmosphere is great along with the music, and the food is amazing and affordable. Once you eat here you will never eat Taco Bell again. I will definitely be back, and next time I will convince some coworkers."}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT!!  Ferdinando was our server, and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with suggestions and answers to our questions.  I would recommend Si Senor to everyone for truly authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's your standard Mexican fare. Although there is no Gluten Free menu, Mexican food is generally one of the easiest to modify to be GF.  

Went for lunch and the place was a ghost town. There was only one other table besides mine at 12:30 PM on a Monday. Do people go out to eat lunch in Cleveland?

The service was friendly and prompt. The food was good, nothing exceptional. The prices were cheap and the serving portions were huge. I felt bad wasting half a plate of food."}
{"text":"Your standard Mexican restaurant. I swear these places all get their food from the same supplier. It wasn't bad but i won't be going back. Whoever said anything off this menu was \"divine\" was a retart."}
{"text":"This place serves up below average Mexican food that's actually pretty bland but quite expensive. The salsa has no taste at all and the queso is lacking (the only time I've met a queso I didn't like so that's a bummer). They have a taco toppings bar which is pretty cool but I still would prefer to go to Cozumel or anywhere else for Mexican food on the west side. Sorry Si Senor but you have to try a little harder :("}
{"text":"Today's meal was the Enchilada Ranchero.  Two chicken enchilada and two beef enchilada. With rice. And also refried beans. All covered in a poblano sauce. And cheese to top it off. 
The enchiladas were tasty. The shredded chicken was seasoned perfectly.  The beef was very food as well. I did enjoy the rice.  But the beans.  Well let's just say I won't knock the score down.  Mainly because I just don't like refried beans.  So I didn't like them. But that's just me. 
The atmosphere was awesome.  The wait staff were very attentive.  
You can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"NOT LGBTQ FRIENDLY!!!   
Sadly, I can't talk about the food or the drinks here because our server said \"hola señoas\" as he approached the table my boyfriend and I were occupying to take our order.   I asked him: \"you mean señores?\"  And he said yeah, yeah with a chuckle. So we left.  

We can say that the salsa tastes jarred not fresh. 

Thanks \"Si, Señor ( ironic) for the worst service ever in the fastest way."}
{"text":"We didn't mind the food - it was hot and made well, and the service was prompt and polite.  However, the chorizo-chicken dish I ordered was fairly flavorless, and my wife wasn't terribly impressed with her tacos.

This is a fine place to stop if you want mexican food, but there are better places in the larger Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been dragged to a lot of mediocre and just plan bad Mexican restaurants by my mom. This is not one of those 'everything is covered in a thick layer of red sauce and microwaved cheese places'. This is freshly prepared, vibrant tasting mexican food in big portions for reasonable prices served by friendly staff. The rice is never greasy and the refried beans are delish. Never ordered anything I didn't like and the margaritas are pretty well made. In warmer weather, sit outside and be serenaded."}
{"text":"Best costumer service ever, great food great people 10/10 would recommend! Paco Es mi mejor amigo"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food..it's good but if you want similar portions, cheaper prices, faster delivery, and extra friendly staff (don't get me wrong they were good here) just go down the street to Cozumel. 

I do hope to check it the patio during warmer weather and overall I thought the decorations are festive and homey."}
{"text":"Mediocre is probably the best word to describe this place. It looks like every other Tex-Mex place in the world. I ordered a margarita and it came with a shot of tequila dumped over it. I wasn't sure if that was an extra shot or if they just served me a snow cone until they manually added the shot. All I wanted was a decent margarita after a long day. The chips were okay and the salsa was pleasantly spicy. My entree - the chipotle chicken - was supposed to be spicy but had no zing of spices at all. The rice was good and the beans were very good. My wife got a  guacamole salad - ribbons of iceberg lettuce with a scoop of guacamole on it. Not the best place by far - and not the worst I have ever had. I want to give it three stars but that actually is being generous. I am not a hater nor a push over. But you can undoubtedly find a lot better place if you try."}
{"text":"very good place, the servers are the best..food is very good drink are as well!! I go here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"We go there a lot . Food is very good and servings are large. 
Food is served hot and fast !
Always salsa and chips on the table. 
Children friendly 
Great place for families."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican decor.  Extensive menu.  Tasty, huge margeritas. Had the house margerita and flautas--4 with rice, lettuce, tomatoes.  Complementary chips and salsa--mildly spicy.  Very tasty overall, and comparable to what I'm used to in Phoenix (recently moved here from there). Clean restroom.  Recommended."}
{"text":"For a Mexican restaurant in Parma (7 hills, but gimme a break here), this is a solid option. 

Of course, don't expect anything authentic (heck, if it was authentic, I wouldn't have known the difference, but the sysco truck out back erased any of my doubts). 

Housed in a former Wendy's, this sit-down place with a few tv's, a bar replacing wendy's service counter, was slow - only 5 tables filled (?) during a recent weekday lunch hour visit. 

The service was ok, normal for any casual sit-down place. I didn't have any negative service issues that others mentioned. The Tortilla chips were warm and came without asking immediately after we sat down. The salsa was extremely mild, tomato paste based, but there were a few bottles of various hot sauces. Drinks were refilled. 

The flautita - I guess it's a taquito ? - with shredded beef and chicken were a tad burned at the ends but still tasty. I enjoyed the mexirice, not greasy. 

If you know anything about Mexican food, ignore me. But, if you're looking for something more flavorful than whatever is it at Appleland or your american chain places in Parma, this is an option."}
{"text":"Si Senor delivers good quality at a moderate price.  The building looks like it used to be a KFC or PizzaHut, so the decor is limited.  The servings were plentiful.  Refried beans, mexican rice and salsa very good.  Nachos were a little soggy.  We were there at a hectic and busy time on a Saturday night with a lot of large parties for graduations yet the service was prompt and friendly.  I will go back to Si Senor."}
{"text":"I visited this particular location on a Thursday night with a couple of girlfriends. The place was not at all busy and we were seated immediately. Our server came over right away initially, but definitely took his time getting back to us each time after that. He may have been giving us a chance to catch up, as we were all talking and catching up with each other so it really didn't bother me. 

We were immediately brought chips and salsa, which you can't really get wrong. These ones were kinda meh. The salsa was a little sweet for my liking and I wished the chips were warmer. We were checked on frequently by someone I assume to be the manager. 

For my meal, I ordered fajitas de la casa which was fajitas with shrimp, chicken, and steak. Usually with fajitas, I get enough food for about 4 meals but this portion size was definitely smaller. It was still a decent amount, though. 

Overall, it's a nice place to eat if you're craving Mexican, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice. I'd definitely like to come back!"}
{"text":"No hostess, slow service and our nachos came out as a salad... Good thing they have 15 dollar margaritas or I wouldn't return"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty much equivalent with any other \"Mexican\" food I've ever had, but I have no complaints.  The setup of the restaurant itself was a bit different than I've ever seen (due to the fact that it was a Wendy's prior to turning into Sí Señor).  The server was friendly and very attentive, everyone's food was served to them exactly as ordered (and at lightning-fast speed...how do they do that?), and the regular frozen margaritas were fantastic.  They didn't taste like the super sugary mix out of the bottle, and the day I went, pitchers were $13.99.  Good value.  Food portions were good, prices were reasonable, and for some reason we were each given a free shot of tequila.  ¡Olé!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The food was great, the margaritas were delicious, the service was fast and friendly!!! Adult and kid friendly. We have found our new favorite Mexican place! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place to be on Taco Tuesday. Excellent food. When traveling up this way I will be stopping in again."}
{"text":"July 9th.

Sat on patio, no server came to the table! Only two tables seated on the patio at the time. Another couple came in, got seated and was taken care of within seconds. Still we sat for 20 min before getting up and walking out. This place has good food. But if you don't take care of your customers....they leave! They will tell everyone of the experience and the talking travels. This place needs to have more people paying attention. Starting with the host as you walk in. Rude and super confused each and every time we were there. We will NO longer visit here."}
{"text":"Si Senor rocks. I was in Cleveland for 2 weeks and ate 4 meals at Si senor. I had lunch once 
and dinner 3 times. Unfortunately, I passed this place by on previous visits.  I thought, \"I live in the desert Southwest, we have 10 plus Mexican restaurants in my town no way this place 
can make Mexican as well as our local places.\"  I was mistaken. 

I started with Taco Tuesday, a safe bet with a fixings and Salsa bar. What a Deal!  4 Tacos and a Miller Lite draft, $9 bucks.   The prep and presentation were good.  I waited only minutes for my tacos, just enough time to munch a few free chips and salsa. Maria is a great bartender and took care of a busy bar with ease.

I liked the place so much that I went back the next day.  Chimichangas rocked. One beef, one chicken. The place was packed with post NBA Championship revelers. I waited a little longer because Maria was not working at the bar. It was a Friday night crowd on a Wednesday.
Once again food good and cold beer $.99 Miller Lite Drafts. 

The highlight was my carnitas burrito I had for lunch. I have had carnitas in obscure beach taco shops and fancy upscale Las Vegas haciendas.  This burrito topped them all.  It takes great skill to get the right texture for carnitas.  The chef is skilled.  

While I sat at the bar waiting for my orders, I inquired to other customers, \"What's is your favorite dish her at Si` Senor?\"  Each person was undecided and answered, \"It's all good!\"
West Park's secret flavor spot....I walked, parking is suspect.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I work close to Si Senor. In the last year, I've gone there around 5/6 times. The margaritas was good. The food is very processed. I got a salad once - it was limp lettuce, not a lot of toppings and over processed fish. I was hoping for a colorful mexican salad. The service is fast, all the employee are nice and the chips & salsa are good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Tuesday night - the restaurant was busy and crowded which was fine but I didn't enjoy how close the tables were. There was a group seated next to us that was almost literally sitting at our table with us, that's how close they were. That always makes for an uncomfortable meal.

The food came very quickly and the portions were large. Typical mexican restaurant food - fajitas, tacos, burritos, etc. Their menu was extensive and there was lots to choose from. An interesting twist is that you can order tacos ala carte and then they have a toppings bar so you can fix them however you'd like.

My bottom line: It was good food and affordable, but I'd probably choose another less crowded mexican joint next time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have loved it both times!  My friend and I enjoy Mexican food and this place has as close to authentic as one can find this far north of the border!!!  The servings are plentiful and this last time the seafood dish I has was so good ....I ate the whole thing!!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAYS! My husband and I now have a new tuesday tradition... Tacos here on tuesdays are on special for GREAT prices! There are at least 10 different selctions and a \"salad bar\" with all the taco toppings you can add yourself.  Its a great mexican meal for cheap! Service is always quick too."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST PIÑA COLADAS I HAVE EVER HAD. I recommend it, it's a must . The waiters were so nice and on the minute with everything, food was great and prepared in a proper amount of time ."}
{"text":"Si Señor is a Mexican restaurant that's popular with locals. The menu is different than usual Mexican restaurants with very few combinations and mostly unique dishes. My quesadilla was good but included many ingredients not listed on the menu. The queso was delicious but the rice was bland, truly flavorless. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant but the service was quick and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we're from Colorado, but finding great Mexican food here has been a challenge. The service was great and the prices too, but the food was okay at best."}
{"text":"Love love love. Texana margaritas are great and you can bring your pup to the patio!!"}
{"text":"Not the best and not the worst. I like their chips and salsa, even though sometimes the salsa is a little too runny. Their margaritas are really good and they definitely know how much alcohol to put in them. The rest of their food is ok, your average Mexican place. I like that there is the option to sit outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Had to take it down a star, last two times I was here the server, same one both times, messed up pretty simple taco orders for just two people. Also, leading up to placing the order, the server couldn't answer a menu question, nor cared enough to go find out the answer. Also , staff was running the vacuum around tables eating, with an hour to go before close, and they were on their phones right in front of customers. Seems like there's not much supervision / management there right now..."}
{"text":"Missing my Mexican friends/food since I moved back from California,  I'm always skeptical of mexican food places.  This place delivered, and then some. Muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"Very solid Ameri-Mex.  Everything was good from the salsa, to the warm tortillas, to the frozen margaritas.  I compare all Mexican restaurants in Cleveland to my favorite Mexican Restaurant, Cozumel.  Based on a recommendation from a friend, we stopped in and had dinner, forgoing our usual Mexican locale.  The service was excellent and the food was fast, but I am not sure if it was fresh.  The queso blanco and salsa verde were both delicious.

Si Senor did not dethrone Cozumel as the Mexican heavyweight in the Cleveland area, in my mind.  The fajitas were good, but not quite as out of this world as the Fajitas Cozumel.  The portion was smaller and the variety of meats within the dish was also smaller than Cozumel. Specifically, not only do the Fajitas Cozumel taste better, but you get a whopping portion that includes shrimp, chorizo, and mushrooms.  Additionally, the chicken in my flautas was a bit dry and had a funky flavor.  You've gotta use fresh meat each and every day to be competitive.

I'm glad we tried a different Mexican restaurant because it reaffirms that we've been getting the best Mexican Cleveland has to offer.  There were only approximately five other people in the restaurant at dinner time, which is usually a bad omen."}
{"text":"First and foremost I gave 1 star because the hostess was very sweet and our waiter was ok... However, never ever tell a customer they are getting soft corn tortillas when indeed it's so obvious they are flour. When I reminded Our waiter he insisted I was incorrect... I was not. If you are looking for original Mexican corn tacos this is not the place. We tried it because it's new and near our home. 
I might return if I was in dire need for a margarita???? Most likely NOT.
I wish them the best!"}
{"text":"They were pretty busy and it took an hour to get a taco salad. The waitress was very nice but the environment and drunk customers made it a bad experience. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Cozumel is better for the price."}
{"text":"Cookie cutter Mexican food that definitely hits the spot. I've been to plenty places with similar menus and this place is at or just above what I consider par. The happy hour special of half off drinks and appetizers is well worth a stop by after work. 

Service was great but it was a Monday afternoon and they weren't terribly busy. Waiter even took the time to show my son how the tortilla machine works. 

We will definitely be back as everybody has to know a place to get good Mexican food. This is it."}
{"text":"Should have stayed where they where. Over expanded themselves and everything has fallen off. Service and food is now half of what it was! Prices have gone up as well as happy hour reduction. Plenty of other Mexican food choices in the area for better food, service and cost. Lose the taco topping bar, it stinks and is gross.

Had to get our own booster seat for our kids. Appetizers never delivered and had to go to the bar to get additions napkins. Server nowhere to be found?!?"}
{"text":"I go here frequently with family, and we all love it.  My favorite thing is enchiladas, especially spinach.  The charro beans, a side, are divine.  And the margaritas really pack a wallop."}
{"text":"Ok, so this isn't your abuela's super secret mole sauce and it's not Ninfa's. It is the best of the Mexican family restaurants that have sprung up all over the West side (joy!). 

We had barely touched cheek to vinyl when a waiter presented chips and salsa. The salsa was really good-- a bit garlicky, fresh cilantro, smoky chili flavor. The service remained extremely fast and very friendly. 

I had the mahi mahi salad. The fish was a bit well cooked, but obviously fresh and tasty, covered in a mild chili sauce. The salad was topped with fruit and lovely, lovely, oh yeah, chimichurri. Herself had the kid's beef burrito, which featured really tasty ground beef (yes, I know, whatever) that was very flavorful, and not drenched in sauce to the point of soupiness, as at some places. Mon cher chou had a chicken enchilada-- again the chicken within had some tasty seasoning and sauce, but was not drenched. And yes, the margaritas were huge. 

NB: f you want to eat here, go at an off hour. This was once an old Pizza Hut. There are only about 20-25 tables, most of which only seat 4. There is always a line out the door Thursday-Sunday nights."}
{"text":"Better than the average Mexican restaurant in the area. I've never had anything here that I didn't like, and the service is always great. 

The veggie super burro is humongous, and filled with really good grilled veggies. The suizo topping is worth the extra dollar or whatever it costs. 

My only gripe about this place is that it is just LOUD if there are more than a few people in there at a time. It is absolute chaos if you come for a meal at the same time someone is having a large party."}
{"text":"Crap service. I placed a delivery order and they just canceled without even telling me. Once I called to find out where it was they told me their driver didn't want to come out and deliver but I could come pick it up. Why offer delivery if you don't actually WANT to deliver?"}
{"text":"We go here about once a week. The specials on drinks are nice. The food is good to excellent. My new favorite dish is the Chimichangas.  I would put this in the top 5 in the area. Service is great. Waiters/waitresses are very nice."}
{"text":"I've been to Si Senor 3 times since I moved into the West Park neighborhood. The first two visits were pretty standard- food arrived within about 10-15 minutes and it tasted about the same as all Mexican food. I'll be honest- I like Mexican food, but most of the dishes taste similar to me and there isn't one restaurant that stands out from the rest. It's all the same to me.
Prices seem a little high at Si Senor.

On Monday, I went in with a group of 8 (including 2 children). We were seated pretty quickly and addressed by several servers. it seemed like they were serving our table as a group, which you would think would get us faster service. However, there were times that we didn't see anyone at our table and couldn't get refills or anything. The food (standard food, nothing special) took 35 minutes. Everything was accurate, but it took much longer than most Mexican restaurants. It was hard to get refills and our checks. We were at the restaurant for over 2 hours. 

I will say that the Baja tacos were delicious. The fish was fried to a nice crisp and I like the slaw that comes with them. Add a nice squeeze of lime, ask for a side of shredded cheese... and you're in taco business! Delish!"}
{"text":"Probably 3 stars at best, 2 things that tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant are their Chips and tortillas, both were average at best here. They had a sauce for the tortilla roll which was decent. The salsa was below par tho. I probably would not come here again unless i am forced to,back to  Chipotle for my lunch needs."}
{"text":"Used to be a Wendy's, and it probably should have stayed that way.

Go to Cozumel instead, just a 5 minute drive down the road!

Here is why:
1. Needs better ventilation, completely full of fajitas smoke
2. Asked for water 3 times
3. Their hot salsa was beyond burned
4. Asked for salsa 2 times
5.  Mango and strawberry/bannana margaritas were un-drinkable... too sweet
6. Service completely disorganized
7. Took 20 minutes to get check
8.  Quesidilla had absolutely no cheese.  What?

COMPLIMENTS:
1. Outdoor seating 
2.  Cheap and good frozen regular margaritas ($2.50)

But, would never come back."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service. Waited like no minutes during a Browns game to get a boatload of food. Love the location in Kamm's. That Cheapotle across the street is an abomination. Should war ever break out between the two, I would strap on my coon skin cap and defend Si Senor like Davy Crockett at the Alamo. Chips were particularly crisp and light. Beef in chimichanga was tender and melted in my mouth. A can't miss."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican restaurant in Parma/Broadview Hts.

Mostly everything I have tried has been good.  The salsa is more smooth than chunky (positive) and always comes with warm fresh chips. The house special menu never disappoints. The food always comes out quickly (less than 10 min after you order) even when the restaurant is full. 

While i've been going here almost bi-monthly for years i've noticed some recent changes, mostly in staffing.  The usual servers have been slowly being replaced by some sub-par employees.  Some of which aren't always friendly or welcoming.  That's not to say you shouldn't stop in because you should if you're looking for good food.  Service however is sometimes hit or miss.

I would say that this comes in third in the best Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area.  It follows Cozumel (2nd) and Momocho (1st)."}
{"text":"Fast service and the food is up fast also. Great selection of soda for the kids.
I love the seafood enchiladas"}
{"text":"Fajitas and steak tacos delicious! 
Fast, friendly service. Will definitely be back for a taco Tuesday! Clean and bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"No beuno! Food was very bland. The fajitas came out so hot the entire bottom burned. All of us were unimpressed. The only good thing seemed to be the margaritas. The music was obnoxious and too loud, and the staff seems completely out of it. No water was brought to us, and we had to ask for everything. I just read the other review and almost puked in my mouth as I sit here wondering what awaits my stomach. I am scared about the salsa and am about to do a shot of pepto just in case. Yikes."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered the food and they said 10 minutes puckup. Came to pickup and the server didnt even give ticket to kitchen. Had to wait even longer for the food. Didnt offer no discount for their messup or nothing."}
{"text":"As far as American Mexican food goes, I suppose this place is legit. 

Your usual Americanized Mexican fare, but these guys make it tasty.

I would rate 3.5 stars but I'll round up for the genial service on a busy Friday night. 

Food 3.5
Service 4.0 
Ambiance 3.5 

Pina colada - sweet with a hint of rum, just like I like it. 

Shrimp Quesadilla topped with Nacho Cheese - this was a guilty pleasure order and it satisfied. It was also HUGE. 

BF ordered some enchilada combo, he devoured it so I assumed it was good. 

Almost all orders come with beans & rice and theirs was pretty damn good. Standard nachos & salsa at table, nothing spectacular. 

I appreciate them having El Yucateco hot sauce on the tables. Kind of an authentic move. Lastly, our waiter was very sweet and attentive, so I'd come back for friendly service and pina coladas. 

I guess if you can't make it to La Plaza and don't want to go to Chilis...come here?"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday with a group of friends for their $1 taco night. Okay I have heard some not so good things about this place to begin with but I was actually surprised at how terrible it was. First of all, the guys who work here seemed to barely speak English, I know it's a Mexican restaurant but you would think they could at least understand what I'm trying to order. But nope they got my order completely wrong. And all I ordered was two soft shell chicken tacos. Instead they gave me two hard shell one beef one chicken. I ended up just eating them because the waiter couldn't understand anything I was saying. They were probably the worst tacos I've ever had, like microwave tacos that were soggy and cold. The plate and silverware also seemed dirty. The plate looked like it had old food crusted all over it. The whole restaurant seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in quite a while. I don't recommend ever coming here. Bad service, not clean, and the food makes me nervous."}
{"text":"Food was bad service was worse, it took 18 minutes to even get a dink and 43 minutes to get our food.  Server was a sarcastic prick when I asked for the rest of my food, as I didn't get the other half of the fajita plate or wraps until I asked for them. Bottom line is I will not be earring here again, and I'd suggest you avoid it too."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Seem to cater to the biker crowd.  Cheese inside the burrito was cold while the outside was hot.  I think they nuked the food that was pre made and chilled then microwaved.  I can microwave food at home."}
{"text":"I thought I'd go try some burrito, queso, etc. the potions are good. Yet the meat and chicken seemed low quality and lacked authentic Mexican flavor. The lunch prices are good but I'd rather pay 2 or 3 bucks more for a Chipotle or Qdoba. Salsa was run of the mill stuff and the queso was real thin."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Mexican type-food is pretty standard.  You've got your enchiladas, your chimichangas, whatever.  Add a side of beans and rice and ole - you've got a Mexican plate.

I was pretty impressed by Si Senor though.  Sure the decor is a little odd and it was sparsely attended but....my props go to our server.

Our server was attentive, brought out water when asked, filled our salsa quickly, laughed at my boyfriends jokes (which made him a fan), and you know what really clinched the evening? For some reason he must have thought we looked like Tequila drinkers because he brought us out two free shots of Tequila.  Now mind you, I'm not much of a Tequila drinker, but thank you very much amigo!  I drank half of it and poured the rest into my Peach margarita.

So in short...thanks to that Tequila shot, you get five stars!  Way to buy off a Yelper without knowing it!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to grab tacos and a drink for years, and this new location is fantastic. The staff is friendly, food is served quickly and is consistently delicious and the prices are low. The new location has a fun build your own taco bar! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed by their service, food, and more importantly... The Margaritas!  You can't go wrong here, it's a regular stop for us locals."}
{"text":"Too much crap thrown in. I don't like or want all the onions and peppers. Portions are decent, but it is all rather run of the mill. There are definitely better Mexican places in the area."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my buddy's birthday. Last night was also New Year's Eve. As you can imagine, the restaurant was packed with people. I was curious to see how our experience would be on a busier night.

Despite the crowds, our experience was just as good as it was last time we visited! (Actually, it was better.) We devoured our chips and salsa like a bunch of Hungry Hungry Hippos, yet they kept our basket full the entire time. 

I had a pork tamale and chimichanga this time, and they were delicious. We also shared a generous pitcher of strawberry margarita; between the 5 of us, we each had enough for a glass and a half. 

They also provided my buddy with a shot of tequila that had some Kahula in it as a birthday gift, which was a nice surprise.

This place is awesome. In my opinion, it is the best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland! Low prices, delicious food, friendly service, and large portion sizes all combine to make a winning restaurant!"}
{"text":"Their food is actually consistently delicious!! I absolutely love their combo that has an enchilada, a chile rellano, and beans and rice. I lovelovelove their salsa and could still eat (drink??) bowlfuls of it!! The spicier option is just as tasty - we usually mix both together - yum. I DON'T love that every time you order their tortillas, they bring them wrapped in aluminum foil and the condensation makes at least one out of three soggy...

And, their service has been much better the past few times I've visited. Although, there's always been something or another that has been missed or we have to remind them of, the servers are always friendly and *for the most part* attentive.

I can't STAND the parking here. a) there aren't too many spots and b) you don't know it's full till you get in and once you do, it's pretty darn hard to maneuver yourself out. Although, since it takes me a while to turn around and get out, every time I've had to do this, there has been someone that has started backing out and I've lucked out with a spot!"}
{"text":"Tryed this place again must of been a bad night the last time I was there but it was a lot better this time. They had this cool ballon guy there I thought it was pretty cool and the food was better so it made up for the bad experience last time"}
{"text":"Chicken mole was good.  Chips and salsa was good.  Service was great. Came to check on us three times. We used a groupon and there was a problem with my iPhone app and they still gave me the discount. I felt comfortable with my twin one year olds and four yr old at the restaurant. I would come here again. We'll see how their other locations measure up."}
{"text":"Very good waiter did everything perfectly and made us feel great being there.  Food was out in less than a few minutes. Food was better than average Mexican. My 10 mo th old twins loved eating the enchilada and refrained beans."}
{"text":"Did I like this restaurant? My answer would be an emphatic \"Si senor!\". This place ranks up there with Cozumel. For starters, fresh/crispy tortilla chips with a mild salsa. Our table had 4 types of hot sauces to take that spice factor up a few notches. Service was muy rapido and very friendly. We came in 20 minutes to closing and had no qualms letting us stay an extra 40 minutes after closing. One of the biggest factors that drew us in was the $4.99 margarita pitcher sale. I was a little cynical at first but this was an authentic pitcher size. Obviously not top shelf tequila but enough to buzz. For entrees I went with the enchilada supremas, which was a platter of 4 different types of enchiladas (cheese, beef, chicken and bean) ($11.99) alongside at least 2 cups of refried beans. Food was definitely tasty, but not spicy. All of this made for a very satisfying and filling dinner (and breakfast day after)."}
