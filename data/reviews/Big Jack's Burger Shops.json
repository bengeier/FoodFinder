{"text":"Family went out to 2 area Burger joints over Christmas break. Looking for the best burger close to where we live. This was our 2nd stop. Big Jacks won over Fresh Burger on Leslie and 16th ave. Nicer spot to sit and eat for starters. Diner like atmosphere - still small but bigger than Fresh Burger. I ordered a simple burger with Cheddar cheese and bacon. Added my choice of toppings and this was easy as the screen made the decision making pretty simple. Order came in about the same time as Fresh Burger. No complaints. Both places had a pretty active lunch time of customers. Kept the order the same at Fresh Burger to compare apples to apples. 
Burger had more taste here. Didn't feel Fresh Burger gave any distinct taste to the burger. Both spots had fresh condiments. I give the edge in fries to here also as cooked with more crispness. Gravy was also quite good. Fresh cut fries must be cooked long enough to get that crisp texture. Atmosphere at Big Jacks was friendlier and appeared eager to please. 
Our family unanimously voted Big Jacks wins our Burger joint comparison near our hood. 
Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day, the poutine was very good with the perfect saltiness and perfect about of cheese to fry ratio. I had the lamb burger which was cooked amazingly. I think the owner is the chef and he seems dedicated to his work. Perfect place for just chilling"}
{"text":"It would be unfair to write a review... It's closed again...  How unfortunate for me... I would hope it's better than its predecessor... I may never know..."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, decent price, massive amount of fries. Love the staff too.

However, their displayed hours are completely wrong. Stating they close at 10pm, when they actually close at 8. On top of that, their verbally stated closing time of 8pm is WILDLY inconsistent. I go to get a burger around 15 minutes to closing to find that they have been closed for what appears to be a while. No staff in the store or anything.

The food is great, and other than the open hours issue I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic, we really enjoyed this place. My better half had the lamb burger, said it was great! I had the Red Neck, it was delicious and huge.  

Could not ask for better service, well the cook looked really grumpy but he was nice (just his look lol).

We defiantly recommend this burger joint, and will return."}
{"text":"I ordered a lamb burger with cheese topping and an order of onion rings. Set me back over $15. I did not want to finnish yo burger because the patty had no lamb taste and was dry. If I had wanted a processed meat frozen patty, I would have gone to a chain. The onion rings had way more batter than it did onion. So in all, my hope to find a single store burger place that would serve a freshly made burger was dashed. Definitely not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, but it will cost you an arm and a leg. This is your typical new school burger shop. It has modernized it's look, added a couple unique things to the menu, and doubled it's prices. 

I had a regular burger with cheese, bacon, fries, and a coke, $14.50. You can sit down at a real restaurant for cheaper. While I was there somebody left after ordering and seeing the price and another guy was visibly perturbed by the prices. I have spoken to a few other people who will not return because of the cost and If they don't smarten up they will not be around long."}
{"text":"Had the poutine.  Was disappointed by how thin the French fries were and they tasted like they had been sitting there a while before being served to me.  The cheese curds were not melted as they normally somewhat are.  However the gravy was amazing!
Definitely not a repeat.  I'll go to Costco next door if in the area and crave poutine!

Will return to try their burgers...until then..."}
{"text":"Burger joins are opening up everywhere but most are run-of-the-mill variations and Big Jack's is one of them. 

The Burger: Thjey claim they grind the meat on site but when I went there for lunch it was pre-made and warming up on the side of the grill. These are not made to order. The burger tasted like, and had the texture of, Harvey's. 

The fries were horrible. What I had was all crumbs. The person in charge must have been blind for not seeing what she was serving me. 

All in all,this place is not worth a stop. Even if in the area, Fresh Burger is a much better option up on Leslie Street."}
{"text":"Very high quality fresh  meat, bread, cheese, fries and toppings.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection.  A simple but detailed and fun menu.  You definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on with this place. You order a burger and fries from the Big Jacks restaurant and they go next door to cook your order. The burger wasn't all bad. It was dry though and the fries were the worst ever, limp, soggy and undercooked blah! Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The onion rings are great. Light and crisp. Cut thick enough so the onion doesn't disappear on you. I tried the burger with the pulled pork. Everything was yummy but it was hard to distinguish the flavour of the beef since the pulled pork flavour was predominant. I would probably order a plain burger next time to get a better sense of the beef patties at this joint. Service was lovely and personable. Definitely going to come here again."}
{"text":"First time in Markham and we were desperate for a quick decent dinner. A quick search on Yelp and figured this looked decent. Pretty easy to find off a main road, from the outside, it doesn't look like much and my husband started putting up a fight to even pull in. But fortunately I convinced him to be adventurous. The menu had some interesting combinations so it did take us a few minutes to decide. The gentleman taking our order was patient and made us feel like family. Kids each order a milk shake and split a burger & fries- it was plenty big enough for them! I order burger with pulled pork & small poutine- so good! Hubby order some kind of ridiculous burger that had grilled cheese as the buns and multiple types of bacon. There was nothing short of amazing for any part of the meal and the service just can't be beat! Since our visit, the kids beg to go back again, even with the 9 hour drive to get there! Highlights- you need to order a milkshake, poutine and any burger. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Last night the usual suspects from the Yelp Burger Brigade assembled to do battle with the classic burger offerings from Big Jack's. Located near Woodbine and Hwy 7, this is the old Prime Burger location with a fresh look... and taste!

Everything about their menu is pretty amazing, traditional burgers with their own kick and touch in the ingredient department. I mean the Redneck burger has peamale bacon that has been battered with crumbled potato chips and deep fried for god sake! And they have more meats to toss on your meat than your physician would recommend.

Turning off my \"Common sense\" button (as I tend to do regularly at these gatherings or MEAT-ups if you will). I followed the example of recent edition to the brigade Ryan F, and went for the biggest and meanest burg they had --The BIG ONE.

The Big one is 2 patties, 2 pieces of peamale (not redneck style), a fried egg, and regular bacon all piled between two grilled cheese sandwich buns. I topped that bad boy with the \"suggested toppings\" which were tomato, onions and whiskey bbq sauce, and voila a coronary concoction fit for a king!

It was so gosh darn big that I nearly unhinged my jaw a l√° a Boa Constrictor or Anaconda just to git a bite in. It was awesome!!! flavours went well together, the bun stayed together on account of the cheese in between holding it together, the slices of peamale bacon were HUGE, most places give you a tiny scrap of meat... this was a breakfast portion, and the whiskey BBQ sauce... well I'd drink it next time I go back and hope to catch a buzz.

We ordered and assortment of sides to share: fresh cut fries, onion rings and their Montreal Style Poutine. While the fries and onion rings were rather standard fare, the Montreal Style poutine was a beautifully displayed portion, huge in size and I was thrilled to hear that both the Cheese Curds AND the Gravy were imported from Montreal! Manifique!! 

I'll return again, perhaps for something more reasonably sized. Who am i kiddin... 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I give every establishment an even chance to impress me. I tried BJB twice to make sure and both times I left upset. 

Red flag #1. First off the menu is confusing and lacks any \"combo\" options.
(forced to order a la carte)

Red flag #2. Drink fridge contains no cans, only 2.50$ glass bottled pops. (another price stab that I take offense to) 2.50$ for a 341mL Coke!!

I finally accepted that my experiance here wouldn't come cheap and ordered up what i felt like. a Redneck burger (breaded peameal slice and whiskey bbq sauce with their 6oz burger) Greek salad and pop. 21$!!!

The salad was dissapointing with soggy lettuce and tomato slices that were mushy and tasted like they had gone bad eg: Barely edible.

The burger looked and smelled amazing and was topped nicely with fresh, thick-cut toppings but the problem was in the dry, overcooked patty. Its obviously a \"meatloaf\" type patty with an overwhelming amount of garlic, spices and cilantro. Why anybody would put \"cilantro\" in a burger mix is beyond me but I could see it and smell it. There's bascially enough seasoning that you won't taste any meat, which leads me to believe they're covering up the taste of very low quality beef. The crispy peameal slice didn't do anything to save this dry burger. 
Their homemade bbq sauce was definitly on the mark but at this point my meal was already ruined. 
On my 2nd visit I ordered a simple cheeseburger and fries to see if they could do that right and although the fries were a 10/10, they came in a box similar to a \"kids size\" and the burger was still dry, overcooked, and loaded with cilantro and spices. At least this time I only parted with 12.50$"}
{"text":"This is in the place where No Bull Burgers closed. But it's just a re-branding by the same owner, Tony Tsakanikas. He owns other No Bull Burgers and Big Jack's locations, making me wonder why there are two brands in the first place. The menu has remained the same even down to the signature burgers. (Both brands have the \"Red Neck\" burger, for example.) The only difference is that the burger patties are now 6oz instead of 4oz, and the prices have increased to reflect the additional beef you get.

Got a double burger for $10+tax. (The No Bull double burger was $8.50+tax.) Patties were very thick. The bun was a disappointment and couldn't hold up. It's so thin that the heel (bottom half of bun) ripped apart as I was eating the burger, forcing me to use the foil wrapping to finish it off. The patties themselves had a distinct mustard-like flavor to them and were a little dry. You might want extra sauce to cover up the dryness.

You must request all of your toppings up front because there are some premium extra charge ones. Unfortunately, this also means you can't control the amount of regular toppings that go on your burger. Actually, you can't even see your burger being assembled because the counter is covered up by some silly graphic reminding us that burgers take time to cook. Harvey's remains my favorite burger joint for precisely this reason -- I love having a large amount of toppings on my burger and I can request enough until I am satisfied. For a premium burger joint I feel this custom assembly feature is required, especially when Subway is across the street and custom assembly plays a key part there.

If you're in the area, Big Jack's is a serviceable burger joint, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #5: Big Jack's Burger Shops

For this stop, I thought that I'd venture a little bit north of Toronto and visit one of Markham's reputable spots. A search for \"Markham's best burger\" brought me to Big Jack's Burger Shops; a small burger restaurant with some pretty welcoming service.

I strayed from good old fashion beef patties this time, and tried out their Opa Burger. It's a lamb patty, on a sesame seed bun, with onions, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and saganaki cheese. As far as I can recall, this is the first lamb burger patty that I've had, and it's pleasantly similar to beef. The Greek influence in this burger was definitely the most enjoyable part of it all, with the light tzatziki and the crisp of the saganaki. I've got to say that I think this burger was a little dry. The tzaziki seemed pretty damn lonely.

I also grabbed a side of sweet potato fries. To their credit, I think that these were the best sweet potato fries that I'd had at that point. They were nice and crispy, and well salted.

So how did Markham do on the burger hunt? As a standalone burger, I'm plenty happy, and I had a good time. As part of the burger hunt, I doubt that Big Jack's is going to put up much competition."}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth it. Ordered off foodora, not at all what was promised. I got the veggie burger, which claimed to be a \"quinoa burger on a ciabatta bun\" but was actually a soy fake 'meat' on a white bun with Sesame seeds. Bun equivalent to dempsters that'd been frozen and thawed, burger a flavourless sad excuse for a burger (Ive had better frozen from Costco), the lettuce --which I had to specially ask for--was limp and soggy. 
Fries tasted like dry cardboard, onion rings were ok but way too tough.
My partner got the \"the big one\", two patties between two grilled cheeses with an egg and peameal and regular bacon. Which was merely ok, but not at all worth the $19. He didn't specifically ask for anything on it, so didn't get any veggies or anything else.
Fries were seperate and extra $.
Literally the worst burger place we've been to/ordered from. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Burgers- a fascinating item for sure. Ground meat in between bread with any topping of your choice. Sounds simple- however somehow so many establishments screw it up. 

Big Jack's does not screw it up. Big Jack knows the formula. 6 oz patties is the right amount. Pulled meat as a topping is what a burger enthusiast wants to see. Having a touch screen monitor to pick your own toppings- makes you not miss out on the exact flavour your pallate desires. Cheddar Cheese wasn't processed...thick slice.

I think they call it Big Jack's because the portions are GIGANTIC."}
{"text":"I started my new job a couple of months ago not far from this place. I was heartbroken to learn that Prime Burger closed down. This place has sewn up the broken pieces and made it all good again.

I came here with my brother and even though I wasn't hungry, I felt like I had to go big or go home (where there are NO burgers). I ordered the Big Smoke burger, which is a full burger patty with pulled pork on top. You get your choice of toppings of which there are tons. I kept it simple with chipotle mayo and whisky bbq sauce with some diced onions. I regret not putting pickles. The burger was incredibly tasty. The meat was juicy and cooked just right, and the pulled pork was great. The fries were the thin, but not perfect McDonald's type of fries and the gravy seemed homemade. Also, the gravy is dairy-free. 

Service at the counter was super friendly. The prices were good, too. Two big-ass burgers, an order of fries and gravy which we shared (it was a TON of fries), and two cokes didn't even come to $40.  

I will DEFINITELY be coming back for lunch and I'll be bringing my coworkers with me."}
{"text":"My first bite was more than spectacular.  The burger meat was so soft and so, so tasty and flavourful.  I am not joking when I say that it was truly a fresh burger and one of the best I've ever had.  I loved how the meat was SO soft and tender.  Delicious!  The burger was also very juicy because the ingredients were fresh!  It was huge to say the least but I did manage to finish it.

Secondly, I was very impressed with the onion rings as well.  They were big rings that didn't have too much batter on them and each one was also very crunchy.  Even after staying out in the air for a while, they remained crunchy.  I also loved how tasty they were.  There were favourful as well!

I think I have to new favourite burger joint now!  I'm not even a huge fan of constant burger eating, but if you are, I highly, highly recommend Big Jack's Burger Shop!"}
{"text":"Their service deserved a 5 star. 

The burger was bland, lacking in flavour.  There wasn't that bbq smokey taste in the beef and all you taste is beef but none in flavouring. My husband tried the double burger with bacon and he said his was more bland but better than Five Guys. 

I wouldn't go back but my husband would try it again."}
{"text":"This place open up in oct 2015 where no bulls was at back of Souvlaki Express. Well it seen it was a re-branding more then a new place. Same family still owns it and alot of same stiff like redneck burger is still there . I think they have bigger patties 4 Vs 6 but nothing really feels different.

I had the big one which was double burger between grilled cheese with peameal bacon. The meat was as good as remember, good Greek style burger didn't seem anything more unique then I knew. Good portion and price.

Thou I have eaten at no bull a few times and never review it but Big Jack is a good place to eat I like their burgers"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there to have dinner. He ordered the Opa lamb burger and I ordered the chicken burger with a side of poutine. I was really pleased with the burger! The chicken was made with real chicken breast. Was most and tasty. The opa burger was yum yum yum! A definite must try! 
Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way down to big jacks. I
ordered the Red Neck BJB.  The gentleman at the counter is very friendly and polite. 

Going with the recommended topping. Whisky BBQ sauce with onions and tomatoes.  Montreal style poutine and a coke.  Coke come in a bottle. Nice touch. 

Give me a few minutes while I dig in to eat my food ........munch munch.....hmmmm. 
Boy, that was a two handed juice dripping good burger!!!  No way to eat it politely. Just need to hold on to it and bite into it anyway u can. Lol. The poutine is pretty good too. Nice beef gravy and melting cheese curds. The fries is freshly cut and and patties is homemade. 
Next time I'll properly go for the smaller regular plain burger....hmmmm NOT!  After this I don't think I can go back to regular burgers.  I'm a changed man now lol. 

 I definitely be coming back for another experience."}
{"text":"This burger joint used to be Prime Burger, they retired and sold out to Big Jacks which has been open for a few weeks now.  Prime was a traditional burger joint and hadn't changed in many years.  Big Jacks is jumping on the new age burger philosophy of adding signature burgers that add a unique flare of unconventional ingredients.

At the suggestion of the friendly staff I went with the Red Neck burger.  This is a burger with added peameal bacon which is beer battered and deep fried.  They explained the batter is home made from chips.  Unique idea, I've eaten a lot of weird burgers, but this is a first.  It was really good, but be prepared for a huge burger that the average person won't get their mouth around.  My only comment was the deep fried peameal was very oily.  They should adjust the fryer temperature to avoid this.

I got the onion rings which were fresh made and it shows, the inside onion was moist and the batter crispy.

The menu is well presented, my one suggestion is to list the condiments on the menu.  The staff was asking \"what do you want on it\" and with some customers having to list them all out.  Take a cue from five guys, they list it all and then have a suggested list of \"the works\" ingredients.

I'll try the regular cheeseburger next to see if my four stars holds up.

Oh ya and they serve pop in a bottle which is far better than watered down fountain pop."}
{"text":"Sometimes your stomach just screams to go against the gym life and get that yummy burger. Sometimes, you have to listen to your stomach! So what did I do? I went for that burger!

It's a small little place that's apart of the greek shop, think possibly the same owners? I ordered a basic burger with cheese and some yummy fixings. The downside? I never got the cheese I was charged for- dang it! Was the burger out of this world? No. But for a burger, it wasn't bad. It wasn't a greasy mess and the temp was just right. Service was friendly and it was close by. All in all can't complain. I could see myself going back for another go."}
{"text":"Decided to try Big Jack's over South Street.  Glad I did.  It is a place that fits with the traditional Burger Joint of years past. Presentation of the meal was very good the team behind the counter and chefs are very responsive and the burger was very fresh as were the ingredients and the presentation. The fries were also a very good  portion. The only thing preventing it from a five-star is the bun   I would have preferred a stronger bun to hold all the ingredients together

 overall value for the money.  Good environment very easy access."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch one Friday afternoon and it was packed at 1:30. All tables in and out were taken and there was a line as soon as you walked in. Nothing like the smell of deep fryers and meat cooking on the flat top. Service was quick and food was fresh and hot. I had the banquet burger combo and my friend had the Opa burger. Both were enormous and equally delicious with juices running down your arm as you ate it! Like other burger joints, they let you choose your condiments but they're really good at recommending what would be best versus \"put whatever you want on it\"."}
{"text":"Just had the \"opa\" lamb burger at Big Jacks Burger...very yummy slab of saganaki cheese atop a generous lamb patty with lots of fresh toppings - delicious! The Greek salad was lovely and fresh with generous kalamata olives. Clean. Good value. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I drive by quite frequently.  I paid a visit yesterday for lunch.  I would say that this burger joint is the old school variety, comparable to tom's burgers (markham) or golden star (thornhill) in terms of menu and ambiance.  However, the food was way better than either of those places.  I was surprised at how busy it was at 1pm on a Monday.  Looks like they have a loyal following (good sign).

My husband had the redneck.  I had a regular cheeseburger.  We split an order of fries + gravy.  My cheeseburger was really good.  I liked that I could have spicy mayo as opposed to the regular boring condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  The pickles were so good.  The burger itself was juicy and flavourful.  

The fries looked amazing, but we got suckered b/c we were served the chippy ends (you know?  no big ones, all scraps).  In hindsight, I should have said something but I didn't really notice until I was leaving and caught a glimpse of someone else's fries).  

No kids menu, which is a bit of a bummer b/c the burgers are huge.  The service was warm and welcoming.  I will definitely go back and give those fries another shot."}
{"text":"Ordered through just to eat for our second time.We found the food a little salty. Some of the specialty burgers are strange combinations in our opinion but probably tasty to most? The regular burgers are great and quite yummy. Poutine is disappointing as its way way salty.  Super great service super nice owner who does the delivery himself would definitely order again now knowing the menu."}
{"text":"Came back for a second try... was no better than the first.
I won't be back, too bad I was hoping for a good option close to work."}
{"text":"Is it bad Yelp protocol to review a restaurant you haven't actually eaten at? Wait, because I've got a pretty good excuse. Big Jack's shares premises with Souvlaki Express, where I was recently inhaling a gyro. While I was there I observed two men - large, sturdy, hockey-sweater-wearing men who looked like they knew their way around a burger - devouring and raving about Big Jack's Opa burger to anyone who would listen. The words \"Wow\", \"incredible\" and \"off the charts\" were used multiple times. Now I'm very much looking forward to giving it a try. I felt that this ringing endorsement should be shared!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Good burgers that don't taste like crap. I was worried it wouldn't taste as good as No Bull but fear not. 

Big Jacks offers more signature burgers like lamb patties with feta, pulled pork toppings and grilled cheese options for buns. As for the patties itself, they are pretty hefty without any by product or fillers. You can taste it in the burger as well. 

I ordered the 6oz burger with cheese, which was a $1.00 extra. For fries and drink, it was a total of $12 which I think is standard for a \"better\" burger combo. You can choose your toppings by touching the screen as you place your order. Nice, efficient touch. 

Giving 4 stars because I waited pretty long for my burger and I was the only order being made at the time. Maybe it's because the patty was big? Was it frozen? It was worth the wait because my burger was delicious and juicy. 

For me, 6oz was too much and they are generous with their fries portion. Easily share the fries with someone else. As for the hidden preparation window, yeah its weird but my burger was fine and I'm sure they dressed with burger according to all the toppings you chose and common sense. 

 If you're the adventurous type or want a change from your average burger, this is nice option aside from the Hero's and Big Smoke's."}
{"text":"The smoke show burger is a 5 star burger in my books. For $10.95 you get a juicy beef patty, topped with pulled pork with perfectly melted cheese. Why have I never thought of this combination before and where has this burger been all my life? 

We also had the red neck burger for $9.99 which according to my sister is amazing aswell. 

Fries are seperate at $3.54 or poutine for $5.99

Service was quick considering how busy they were. Seating inside is limited. There are some seats outside aswell. Parking is very limited aswell. 

If you go on their website they have a $2 off coupon for any orders over $12. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because they forgot the cheese curds in my poutine. All I got were fries and gravy. I'm sure I could have showed them my bill and showed them my fries and they probably would have gave me my cheese curds but I didn't feel like going though all that trouble. 

Price is also pretty high but quality is definately worth it for me."}
{"text":"Burger Brigade 10 Sit Rep...Transmission Beginning...On acceptance of the last B.B Mission.  We ventured out to the east end of the GTA towards Markham to try out Big Jack's Burger Shop.  We all arrived for the BB and I decided to get the biggest burger that they offered.  The \"Big One\" as it's called is a Two Grilled Cheese Buns, Double Burger, Peamael and Strip Bacon and One Egg creation that was sure to stuff my gullet with burgery goodness.  The rest of the Brigade impressed me by ordering 2 more \"Big One's\", a Pulled Pork sandwich, a \"Red Neck\" (6oz Burger, Beer Battered Peameal Bacon Coated with Potatoe Chips,Swiss and Cheddar Cheese) and various sides.

  I recieved my \"Big One\" and was a little underwhelmed, it's not to say i wasn't impressed by the creation...I just thought it would be \"bigger\".  The burger was tasty, a distinct flavor of the whisky bbq sauce lingered on the pallate, the bacon wasn't as crisp as I would like it but it did add to the flavor.  I was a little confused, as the burger patties almost looked pre-formed, but on the menu it states that its \"6oz AAA Certified Angus Brisket, ground fresh daily on site\".  The other burgers that were ordered looked mighty tasty as well.  I think if I was to return the \"Red Neck\" burger would definitely be my next mission.

  The staff at Big Jack's were friendly and very helpful.  They walked us through all the diffrent toppings and basically said if there is a burger that you want and we have the toppings we can make it.  After finishing the mission, I think that the Brigade completed the mission succesfully.  I give the mission 3 stars.."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

We've passed by Big Jack's a few times, but never had the opportunity to dine here until earlier this week. We arrived just before closing, but the nice employees inside agreed to serve us. Excellent idea considering I arrived 5 mins before closing anyway!

My dad and I ordered the pulled pork burger, the red neck, and a regular burger with saganaki cheese. All three burgers tasted very good! The patty isn't as thick compared to, say, Tom's Burgers, but the taste was just as good. The recommended ingredients in the red neck were perfect, and I highly suggest sticking with those ingredients (unless you're allergic to something). I ordered the regular burger with saganaki cheese as I've never tried that cheese before, and it did taste decent, though I wonder if it was worth an extra $3 for what tasted like fried cheese...

I also ordered onion rings as part of the red neck combo, but I somewhat regretted it as they weren't really anything special.

Bonus points for this restaurant for offering bottled pop, as in glass bottle. It's more environmentally friendly, and glass bottles maintain the pure taste of soft drinks.

I definitely wanna try the lamb burger next time I visit here, it seemed quite unique."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Jacks twice and was happy with my visits. The person taking the order is friendly and helpful. You do have to wait a bit for the burger to be ready but at least I know it's well cooked. The burger is a good size and very tasty. My wife had sweet potato fries as her side but found them saltier than what she prefers. By the end of the meal we were both full. I find it a bit pricier,especially the drinks."}
{"text":"Having been to the previous burger shop that was in this location a few years back and been unsatisfied I was a bit leery to eat here again. I had thought they had just changed the name and cleaned up the inside. Boy was I wrong. Big Jack's is offering up fresh tasting and interesting burger combinations in a very clean and welcoming environment. Upon entering, it was clear that this place wasn't nearly as \"rough\" looking as I remembered the location being before. I ordered a regular burger with peameal plus a water (only a Greek mineral water is available at $2 a bottle, quite reasonable). Upon having my burger dressed to my request, I was immediately impressed by the smell of the meat. This wasn't the basic frozen beef burger I was expecting but instead a fresh-tasting flavourful patty. Just the fact that fried onions are available as a topping at no extra charge is a huge one-up in my book. I like Big Jack's is going to be my preferred burger stop in York Region! Next time I'd like to try their Saganaki burger (the standard burger patty with Greek flambeed cheese)."}
{"text":"Got my food delivered through Uber Eats. It blew my mind. Super good. Huge ass poutine and a big burger."}
{"text":"My first time there and I got the cheese burger with fries. 
- They have a screen in front of the cash so you can easily pick out your condiments, toppings, sides and drinks. 
- The service was timely. 
- They give a generous amount of fries, all \"freshly\" cut...couldn't say they were the freshest but I figured it was because I got there after the lunch rush. 
- The burger itself was tasty, you can really taste the angus meat. I believe when eating a burger you should be able to enjoy the taste of the meat without having condiments over power your taste buds. Definitely a better burger than any fast food chain and its worth your $. 
- The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because they forgot my hot peppers on the burger and the fries were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"Burgers here taste great and made to order.  I like that they have a vegetarian burger as well."}
{"text":"I ordered their original beef burger with cheese and upgraded my fries to a poutine. If you like Harvey's burger, then this is the next level up of a char-grilled burger. The burger bun is nothing special, but the patties are nicely seasoned and lots of toppings to choose from. Their poutine was really good, the gravy was perfectly salted, and good amount of cheese curds on top of some nicely done skinny fries!

I saw a lot of people ordering their steak cut onion rings, and they looked amazing. It's probably something I'll order and try next time I visit Big Jack's Burger."}
{"text":"Stumbles upon this place by accident. Burgers are pretty good, but the staff is great. Very sociable and happy to have tour business."}
{"text":"I didn't really have too much expectations walking when I came in. I didn't think it would be fair to compare them to Prime Burger,  which I personally thought had the best burger in the area, so I kept the notion in my head that this place is new and I shouldn't be too critical and to be a little reserved if I found anything negative. Big Jack, I apologize for ever thinking that. 

Walking in to the little burger joint, you will notice that it is not very big, maybe 6-12 small tables that sits two. The general look of the shop is very reminiscent of some burger joint you would see in some old Archie comic. The look is simple, clean and comfortable.

I approached the counter and ordered The Red Neck burger and also an order of fries with gravy.. As I was making the order there is a monitor by the register that shows what you ordered and the options available. Very convenient since they have quite a few extra items you can add to your burger such as egg, cheese, etc.


The Red Neck Burger

Whats in it?  

2 burger patties with a slice cheese on each patty, 1 piece of beer      battered peameal bacon and buns

What I got for toppings(free): 

Lettuce, sauteed onions. ketchup, and mayo


How everything went down....

When I first picked the burger I was a little confused as to what the peameal bacon was as I have never seen anyone do it that way before. The peameal bacon was completely dipped into beer batter and initially I thought maybe they gave me a piece of chicken. Visualize a Big Crunch burger from KFC, except good Colonel decided to go pig that day. When I took a bite into it I was pleasantly surprised as it was very juicy and the beer batter did not over power the flavor of the bacon, while maintaining its crispiness. 

The cow portion of this burger included two 5 oz patties with a slice of cheese on each patty. The burger was very juicy and the flavor of the meat really sticks out. I've had better burgers before but this burger can contend with some of the best in my opinion.

When cow and pig combine.... 

The mix of the juicy burger and crispy peameal bacon was really unique to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would definitely order this again.  

....what about the fries?

The fries were pretty good, I just couldn't really enjoy them as i was pretty full from the burger."}

Big Jack's Burger is the newest Burger Joint in town.  Seems like \"gourmet\" burger is the thing now in the area.

5oz AAA Certified Angus Brisket, Ground Fresh Daily on Site

A basic burger for $5.99 is on the pricey side as a combo will be another $4.49 on top. The Big One is $13.99 with double patties, double bacon and egg...

Smell of meat can be intoxicating inside on a hot day, I smelled like meat while waiting for my burger to be ready. Luckily there is some outside seating for me to enjoy my lunch.

Basic Burger ($5.99) & Fries ($2.49)  
- The patty was really good with a good texture and I can in fact taste the beef itself
- Choice of whole wheat and white bun
- Standard toppings aside from sauted onion and you pick when you place your order
- I finished my burger and I just comfortably full, so if you are a bigger appetite, Double Burger and extra meat toppings ?bacon, peameal, pulled pork, egg?maybe the way to go

Service is friendly but expect a longer wait time during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Really good burger ,chicken burger was really good. Nice piece of lightly seasoned chicken breast. Both were cooked well but not over cooked , juicy but not to juicy. The buns were sesame seed buns, fresh and held together well. The fries were old school, basic but that's what old school fries should be. Would I go back ?? Of course good food fair price. Pride in the service and product"}
{"text":"The burgers were decent especially for the area with limited burger choices.  I ordered the double burger with cheese and a fried egg.  The egg was perfectly cooked and the burger was pretty tasty. Oh and the burger was huge!! 

Over all it was good experience the staff was friendly the place was super clean. I would go back there again and try their signature burgers."}
{"text":"Big Jack's burger is goumet burger no doubt.  First of all, the special burgers are over $8.  Secondly, the Smoke Show burger ($10.95) is huge and filling, and it gives you enough pulled pork to tame your craving for the rest of the day, maybe for the week.  The burger is most definitely juicy, though not sure it is from the patty or from the sauce in the pulled pork.  It is flavour overloaded, man.  The Lamb Burger ($8.29) is bold in the flavour of, guess what, lamb.  Even though the patty is not big (see picture), the flavour is *not subtle*.  So depending on your preference on the lamb flavour, this burger can be good or bad.  I can objectively say that it is not dry at all (lamb meat = moist).  

I would say come to Big Jack if you crave gourmet burgers.  For everyday simple hamburger, I will take Tom's Burger on Hwy 7 over Big Jack's, because I think Tom's is cheaper."}
