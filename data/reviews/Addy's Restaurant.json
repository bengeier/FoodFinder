{"text":"Just sat in there for a half hour watching numerous people being served ahead of me.   No reason for that.  No excuses."}
{"text":"Don't go to Addy's expecting white table cloth dining or first class service.  It's not that kind of place.

Instead, it's a group cheap place to eat downtown during the week, particularly for breakfast.  My favorite is the breakfast special with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, choice of meat, and hash browns.  With tax included, this comes to a total of $3.89!  How can you beat that?

Addy's is conveniently located  on Saint Clair next to Side Bar near Key Tower.  The food prep is very quick and I found it almost too convenient to call them and place my order as I was walking from W 9th towards Key Tower and they would have it ready as soon as I got there.

This is one of those great eats around town that is so good you can almost always find a couple of cops sitting there eating.  I'm convinced that cops know every place that has good value in every city.  Ever been to Slyman's?  It's always got a couple of cops eating an entire week's worth of lunch meat in one sandwich for the price of one sandwich...."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and work close but I doubt I'll come back. I've watched the cook each time and he NEVER WEARS GLOVES. I've seen him crack raw eggs then touch cooked bacon with his bare hands. You'd think they would be more careful since you can watch the cook prepare your meal but that's not the case"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  We were a party of 19 and the waitress, the owner's daughter, was very efficient in making sure we got our food as quickly as possible.  Would come back whenever in downtown Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Can't beat it for the price!   Great breakfasts and salad bar and friendly, fast service.  And people who give it one star when it's not open when a website not connected to the business said it was supposed to be?  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Addy's is one of the great diners in the Cleveland area. They really hold true to the old-school diner aesthetic. The cooks are husband and wife, and the waiter is the son. Talk about \"mom and pop\"! You know the money you're paying is going directly to supporting these wonderful people. I will continue to eat at Addy's whenever I need a quick breakfast in the city, and you should give it a try as well! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this family ran resturant.  I'm a breakfast lover, no I'm the King of breakfast lovers and for 30 yrs. there is no better place then Addy's to enjoy a breakfast."}
{"text":"Well, it's a diner, not much more to it. It's kinda exiting for us Norwegians with traditional American diners where the waitresses are 50+ and say \"here ya go honey\", but food-wise we've had WAY better. I went for the roast beef sandwich with gravy, HUGE mistake, should have done like the others and gone for omelet, which is harder to fuck up."}
{"text":"It has the look of a greasy spoon diner but the food doesn't taste like greasy food diner food, know what I mean?  

The mushroom omelette has FRESH mushrooms (how many greasy food diners -- or non-greasy food diners for that matter -- use fresh mushrooms??), it was big and very filling.  It was really good!  The potatoes that come with it are a bit on the greasy side, however, but still good.  As for the toast, I took the advice from other reviewers and asked for light butter and that was a smart move!

Trying to find a good, quick, easy breakfast in downtown Cleveland is quite difficult.  I think I found my spot! :)"}
{"text":"Good place, good food, good price. Nothing fancy but some well executed solid food. Went there for lunch and had a cup of chili and the chicken parm with a side salad. Nothing special about the salad. The chili was very nice and tasty with beans and meat. The chicken parm was actually really good, crunchy and cheesy, as it should be. The side of spaghetti was nicely cooked, al dente.

Would definitely go back and recommend"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the rating are so high on this place. Wish I could give minus stars.

This place has lots of tables and you know it's a local place. Most people were greeted by name. It doesn't help that the employees were arguing over $30 so loud.

I got a veggie omelette. It came with home fries and toasr. Terrible!!!!!! It was burnt and cold. The place was very dirty. The waitress was horrible. I had to get up and get my own coffee. She asked me how my food was when I was done.

I will never ever go back. Yelp reviewers disappointed me on this one!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, inexpensive, filling, and tasty. The waitress had a great sense of humor and waited well. The cook knows sunny-side up, the yokes were runny and the whites solid!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast here on a Saturday morning and after a hard night of having too much fun - they saved my day!!! Waffle was perfectly cooked! This place is the perfect diner to cure the brown bottle flu! Def coming back when we come back to town!"}
{"text":"Addy's is a simple, classic diner stuck in the busy din of downtown Cleveland. Being from Los Angeles, I wish there were more places like this...

Everyone is extremely friendly, coffee is fresh and plentiful, though my cup may have overfloweth, and the food is choice and tasty. The best part? You have to actually TRY to spend more than $5.

Parking sucks, ask for easy butter on your toast. Otherwise, this is my kind of diner!"}
{"text":"Solid diner food.  Looks like lots of lawyers eat here before they send clients to the clink.  Service was friendly and fast.  Breakfast for 2 was only $12 so it's incredibly inexpensive.  Good size portions.  Great looking salad bar for lunchtime.  Open on Saturday but only until noon.  And the previous poster IS right--tell them to go easy on the butter when you order toast.  Otherwise it will be slathered on heavily and glistening under the lights, staring up at you."}
{"text":"Great old school diner with low prices. Just had a one egg breakfast with home fries, sausages and coffee for $6. Can't get that in the chains out in the burbs."}
{"text":"Great plain fare at a very reasonable price, helpful staff, and close to the Rock and Roll Museum"}
{"text":"Oh, it's a diner... No thrills here. Eat cheap and beat feet, just the way I like it! It could use a update or two and a scrub down."}
{"text":"Friendly older Eastern European woman bustles about.  Inexpensive delicious breakfast food. Pancakes great. Solid diner coffee. Convenient location close to the Convention Center. I went three times in four days!  Lots of cops here, which is an endorsement of both quality and price."}
{"text":"quick and easy, its how i like all my meals to go. great prices for this quick little diner, and by quick i mean lightening speed service. I had a pattie melt that im still craving even after i demolished it. Good greasy fast american food is my fave,.also a great little breakfast spot as they are few and far between in downtown."}
{"text":"This is a great little place, a short walk from my office.  This place has been around for years.  You can't be the freshness of the food and you definitely can't beat the price.   Addy's is family owned and only open for breakfast and lunch.  I've had breakfast here a few times, but mostly go for lunch.   Breakfast is available all day and as other reviewers have mentioned, the price and portion is outstanding.  My favorite lunch choice is the salad bar, which has a boatload of items to choose from.   If you are eating in the restaurant, it's all-you-can-eat for $6.99+tax.  The offerings include, the regular salad fixings, iceburg lettuce, mixed with spring greens, tomatoes etc.   There are also sliced hardboiled eggs, 2 different types of shredded cheese, fresh mushrooms and at least 10 dressing choices.   There also at least 10 additional mixed salad choices, such as seafood, tuna, chicken, chickpea, taboulie, pasta, egg, etc.   Last but not least there are a number of dessert offerings to include jello, ambrosia, oreo mousse, homemade cinnamon rolls and fresh fruit (pineapple, watermelon, honeydew, strawberries and cantaloupe.   There is also fresh pita bread and saltines to accompany your meal.   All of that for just $6.99!    There is also an extensive lunch menu offering sandwiches (hot and cold) and there is a daily special boards which showcases that's days offerings.   Today's the special was roast chicken with stuffing or mashed potatoes, vegetable and roll for $6.99.  I'll continue to go back....again and again."}
{"text":"I rolled in on Addy's and found a perfect breakfast place here in CLE.  The coffee is surprisingly good for a diner. The veggie omelette was great and inexpensive.  The waitress was nice and brought my food quickly along with the coffee. As I love finding locally owned breakfast places, this is perfect for me, and I will be returning when I come back to CLE."}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying at the Marriott downtown [Key Centre] and were looking for a place to eat breakfast. We were told about Addy's which was very nice. We were seated immediately and coffee arrived promptly. We placed our order [french toast for my friend and I had eggs, toast and bacon] We were able to linger after eating without a problem and the price of the meal was very reasonable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would recommend eating here if you are staying in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great local place for a breakfast or lunch.  Too bad it's location is blocked because of construction.
It has a salad bar at an all in price of 7.99. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.
Clean, homey and down home taste.
Daily specials and very convenient to many top hotels, downtown.
We found it because of Yelp and then told our hotel to add it to their list..."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is right across from court so you'll catch a lot of attorneys and judges eating here. Definitely a diner type setting. The food is cheap, fast, and usually pretty good. The salad bar is great and has tons of items to choose from. The owners are soooo nice, and so are the employees. It does seem a little dirty, like other reviews have stated. Not necessarily the kitchen or seating area, those seem okay. The bathroom is sort of what gets me. The vent looks super dusty. Anyways, this place is great if you're looking for something fast and tasty, and don't want to spend a lot of money. For sure not fancy, but you won't be disappointed with the food, service, or price."}
{"text":"After a meeting downtown I stumbled upon Addy's.  I was just in the mood for a quick little breakfast and Addy's hit the spot.  Everything you would expect at a bigger breakfast chain however made fresh and quick.  Service was good and cool location around a lot of downtown activity. Will be back."}
{"text":"I work next to this building and pass this place everyday. Went in for the first time today and WILL NEVER GO BACK. I ordered a BLT and some fries. The lettuce had brown spots in it like a bug ate through it. Why would you serve that to a customer. Whoever puts that lettuce on had to have clearly saw that. They served my food in a Styrofoam box no paper to line it or anything so my fries and BLT had melted the box. So not only do you have bug caves in your lettuce you have Styrofoam melted in your food not a good place to eat. The toast for the sandwich was cold it was the bacon and the hot fires that took the brunt of the Styrofoam. My friend ordered the onion rings and a burger she said the burger was average but for 6$ you can get a better burger anywhere and they served her four onion rings she only ate two because they were gross. 

While we were waiting for our food I walked over to the salad bar to check out what kind of things they have hoping that since this place is so close I could come back one day until a waitress in broken English said that is for the salad bar not for you. Seriously lady, I am a professional adult women not a child. 

To top it off they dont even take cash and dont even make that known until you have already been rang up. If I knew that I would have prepared and not spent 2.50 at the bar next door. I wouldnt eat here again if they were giving the food away."}
{"text":"Very good basic fare breakfast place with a nice staff.  Family owned, and clean.  Very good value."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars, not because of the food, but because after we had finished eating and were ready to pay, we were then informed that they accept CASH only.  Not wanting to pay an ATM fee, my fiancé had to run home to get cash... Just a super inconvenience! They should at least have a sign on the door or inform you when you come in. Otherwise, the food is okay."}
{"text":"Staying next door at the Marriott.  Spent half the money I would have spent on breakfast at the hotel and the food was just as good. Service was solid too.  Owner's daughter waited on us.   
Had french toast, eggs, bacon.  Omelet's looked good......May try one next time!"}
