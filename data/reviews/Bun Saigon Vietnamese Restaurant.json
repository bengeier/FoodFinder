{"text":"Hands down, my favourite place for Bun dishes, specifically the kind with soup as most Vietnamese places in the area don't offer the variety of bun dishes as this place does. The dry kind is also delicious. I usually order either Bun rieu, Bun bo hue, or bun mang vit. I also really like their special dishes like the banh cuon and their goi cuan. I'm not a big fan of their pho though. so I only go here for Bun dishes and other vietnamese dishes rather than pho."}
{"text":"Great service, large portions, tasty food prepared and served fast.  If the weather forecast had been right, I'd have been stuck at home eating Cheerios in ketchup (that's not an exaggeration, I'm a single guy). Thank you weather gods! I was on my way to the familiar Pho Pasteur when I walked by this little place that I'd passed by so many times.. But this time was different. I consulted my Yelp app, did a u-turn and went in. I was initially cautious because it seemed empty from the outside, but it was a needless worry!,  This, this is my new go-to spot for Vietfood. The bun was a large portion, the chicken was grilled yet tender, the spring roll was cracklin', coconut shake sweet n tasty and the Heineken, four bucks. Can't go wrong here! And for the i-dont-eat-in-empty-places crowd, quite a few people came in, in quick succession.  Summary? Skip the Train, and walk to Saigon!"}
{"text":"I went here just right after noon time and it wasn't packed. The place had some nice asian décor near the cash register.   I ordered vermicelli with spring rolls, beef, and meat sausage. It was good, especially the spring rolls! Fish sauce was kind of plain.   The pho that I shared with my friend was mediocre. And my tea wasn't even a good warm.   When I paid and tipped them, they said they forgot to add my drink---which was fine . So they told me to pay an extra 1.75. After I paid them that and turned around to get ready to leave, the lady told me that the drink was $2.50 (for a CANNED Nestea).   At this point I was annoyed because it took them 3 tries for me to pay. Needless to say, I probably won't come back since there's way better pho restaurants around the GTA."}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese place in Toronto. i always get the vermicelli noodles with pork and it never dissapoints. Nothing remarkeable but it feels better than a lot of the other Vietnamese places ive eaten in. And its a nice sit down dinner"}
{"text":"Average environment, quiet place. Staff were okay. The food wasn't so great, noodles are on the hard side and causes an upset stomach. Cleanness level should be concerned."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I think it is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown. Customer service and food quality are great. Food doesn't have too much to none MSG like some other places I went to."}
{"text":"Convenient location on Spadina and located on the 2nd floor. Standard viet restaurant with the standard pho, vermicelli, rice, etc that you would typically find at vietnamese places. We each ordered the chicken vermicelli with spring which was about $8. The dish was again standard although there was a bit too much fat on the chicken and there wasn't a lot of meat or vegetable on the top either. Nonetheless, it was pretty flavourful and definitely hit the spot. Service was alright. Being in the Chinatown area, I would consider exploring other viet restaurants nearby next time."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places for pho. The strange thing is that they only have two sizes. Small or a large.  I always order the large. The portion on the large is generous and the ingredients are good.   The broth is very tasty and the meatballs are included when you order the special.  Price is reasonable $6-7 similar to every other place in chinatown.  The place has been renovated but the ambiance is ordinary.  They have a flat screen television you can watch with asian girl bands performing songs while you eat.  The service is good and the food/bill comes quickly.    I definitely recommend this place.  It is one of the better pho places in chinatown."}
{"text":"Prefer this to Pho Hung. Fast service and excellent food, particularly the vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll. I will be back."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I go here almost once a week sometimes more. We always get the Pho but sometimes get something different.  The pho is great. It has good chicken because other places I've been too has pieces of chicken bone in it and this one does not. We choose between thick noodles and thin noodles.   The service is OK. They move too fast so I have to call after them to get what I need.   The smoothie drinks are the best. I get one every time I go."}
{"text":"Good portions, fair price, and fresh ingredients summarize the experience. The restaurant is unpretentious and open. The client base is varied and friendly as well. Not where you go for a fancy night out but where you go when you want some good home cooked food. Pho is great!"}
{"text":"Completely flavorless and expensive for being so terrible! It is hands down the worst Vietnamese food that I have ever had, which is quite an accomplishment. The service was horrible. They bought us the wrong food and then overcharged us. My recommendation would be to AVOID."}
{"text":"The meal The menu is great for beginners - there's a lot of tabs for different sections and there are lots of pictures so if you're not familiar with what you're ordering, you won't be surprised.  I had pho and a mango milkshake.  The pho was good and wasn't overly salty/msg like a lot of other places. The mango shake wasn't thick enough but it wouldn't stop me from getting it again.  My gf had a vermicelli bowl. The pork in it was awesome! So juicy and flavourful!  The service Every table in the restaurant was taken and the service was... what it should be at an Asian restaurant.  It wasn't overly helpful or , but it was there when you wanted it.  The price - $19 + tip  Would I go back again? I'm not quite sure where other people are eating if they say they've had better and cheaper... this is one of the cheapest places to go... I'd definitely go back again.."}
{"text":"This is my go-to bun/pho place in Chinatown. The food is consistently delicious and portions are more generous than others in the area. Service is super quick so it's perfect for a lunch hour."}
{"text":"Just like what other reviewers said, this place has a very homey and comfortable ambiance. I had the pho and my bf had a bun. I liked my pho, it's not the best I've had but it's definitely good. I thought they had pretty good quality beef compared to other places. I would come back here again for their pho. My bf said their bun was not bad, but it wasn't good enough for him to want to come back for the bun. They had pretty good service and overall we enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  Sometimes I really crave for pho but I'm not around College West or Ossington area, so I have to settle for less decent pho.  The pho itself is  average, and they use thin vermicelli type of noodle instead of flat one, which is not good.  The broth has sweetness which I am sure it's due to MSG.  They really need to improve on the amount of meat portion, which I find it to be insufficient, and offering only two size options is not very customer friendly.  I also had their rice dish before which I think it's ok, better than their pho.  Service is efficient but definitely not friendly, after all it's in Chinatown so... Overall since Chinatown doesn't really have decent pho joint so there's really not much different of visiting this joint or other joint in the area."}
{"text":"AWFUL culinary experience for someone who spent a long time traveling through Vietnam and who is a Vietnamese food enthusiast. Food was overall bad, staff was not nice, our order was wrong and we've also been overcharged for a dish. When we told them they didn't even apologize. An experience to forget. Spadina Avenue's worst nightmare."}
{"text":"Been going here for years!  The food is amazing and so is the service, Everything is fresh and tasty. Can't  go wrong if you want to try Vietnamese food for the first time."}
{"text":"Bun Saigon is one of a few Vietnamese restaurant that not a lot of people are aware of but if you are familiar with traditional Vietnamese food, this place is a must visit.  The last time I was there, the owner (lady with a heavy English accent) greeted me with a warm smile & asked why I haven't been there for months.  Said I was busy & that I liked the new look (modern decor with Vietnamese music in the background).    I then proceed to order my favorite dish ( sour soup with catfish) and pork cooked  in clay pot for 2.  My friend wanted some Banh Cuon so we ordered that too.  I have to say, their sour soup is one of the best I had, surpassed only by my mom's.  The Banh Cuon was also excellent.  My friend & I finished that before our soup came (takes time to make I guess) but it was well worth the wait.  I normally ordered their tripe sausage (one that  comes along with that smelly shrimp paste sauce) but declined since my friend & I didn't want to stink for the rest of the night lol.  For the value & authentic Vietnamese food, Bun Saigon is a place you need to visit.  The owner is nice & will help you with any questions if you are not familiar with their food."}
{"text":"This is another good lunch place near U of T.  The Pho is good, the portions are big, and the prices pretty reasonable.  Also good for groups."}
{"text":"Been here many times as my husband likes their pho...I think it's OK. ..  Not super kid friendly, we almost come here at a regular basis (at least once a week). We always have to ask for booster seats...to the point that I have started taking my own boosters today.... Placed the order and the staff was not in his pleasant attitude, looked like he was annoyed by kids or just don't like kids...  Having been here many times, I am finally fed up to the point to write this review.   Food is decent but lots of work is needed for customer service."}
{"text":"So, maybe Bun Saigon doesn't have the best pho in town. It makes up for it with its huge and awesome menu, full of dishes that my Vietnamese friends tell me you rarely see anywhere else around here.  But my Authentic Vietnamese Experience dinner was some time ago, so today I'm going to review today's lunch.  Ordered the Bun (noodle dish) with shrimp on sugar cane and spicy pork. Noodles a bit dry, but a good dose of nuoc cham dipping sauce takes care of that. The pork is mildly spicy, nicely grilled, and delicious. But the real star is the shrimp: a big dose of shrimp paste served on a piece of juicy sugar cane. This is not a stingy portion - dried out sugar cane barely dipped into shrimp paste. It's big, fresh, and damn near addictive.  Gotta go back for more soon. But perhaps next time I'll bring a Vietnamese friend or an encyclopedia of Viet food to help me get through the menu."}
{"text":"Good pho and service. Ordered the traditional pho ga with famous Vietnamese springrolls. The food was very fresh. They are quite stingy on the chicken in the chicken pho. There was barely any chicken visible. The springrolls was superb fresh and crispy. Just the way I like it. The service was great. Came in an early afternoon and this place was busy and packed. The Decor was great as well.   Overall, great experience. Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some hot noodles or noodle soups among other Vietnamese food. I ordered the veggies over rice sticks, which came with broccoli, Chinese greens, mushrooms, onions and ground black pepper. Was very refreshing. The service was good. The ordering is also very simple - you write the numbers of your dish on a piece of paper. I was glad that this place takes credit cards since a lot of restaurants around it does not. They also provide a pot of green tea, warm and perfect for the Toronto winter. Overall, I'd go here again if I get the opportunity to. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bun Saigon is your typical vietnamese restaurant. Prices were decent, pho was good and the restaurant was relatively cleaner than other Chinatown restaurants.  The pho had a decent amount of rice noodles and meat. The soup was tasty and not too oily. Surprisingly there was not as much MSG since I was not dying of thirst after finishing the bowl. I would add it to my roster of pho restaurants going forward."}
{"text":"I've tried many places for Bun Rieu and this is one of the best places for this dish. The broth is so flavourful it doesn't really need any additional seasoning. Another plus is the menu variety. Bun rieu is actually somewhat hard to find and not all Vietnamese restaurants have it on their menu. I have been to this place quite a few times and think I should perhaps try some other dishes  to see if they are just as good."}
{"text":"I was once in Paris when I last saw a lady bring in her dog (one of those ratty small ones), and had it sit on the table while she fed the fur ball. That actually cheesed me off about most places in Paris that they allowed that.  The food and menu here are good, great selection of Viet dishes with some great shakes to boot. The shakes and juices are great especially if you had a heavy night and need to re-hydrate.  Word of warning do not get the frozen shakes in winter, they taste great but the brain freeze will be painful.   So again on Spadina just as we are half way through our food a lady, obviously known to the staff and owners, trots in with her handbag dog who runs around the place sniffing the f*k out of everyone's legs.  Would not go to a restaurant that allows pets in, I know most rat dog owners wont mind that kind of place but if I wanted to eat with animals I would build an ark and call myself Noah."}
{"text":"This place was sooo much better than Pho Hung. The food was at delicious and the service was speedy and considerate. The owners made us feel very welcomed and even joked with us the entire time we were there. We ordered a bunch of rice combos and guess what? They give you a side soup with the rice combos! Which is a plus because back in the states, finding a viet place that automatically give you a side soup with your rice is VERY rare. They always do it the half ass way. However at Bun Saigon, they do it the way things are supposed to be done. everything about each portion that my family and I ordered were perfect. They gave moderate, considerable amounts of food, the right portionality, and the right sides that is culturally correct for each meal. I would definitely be back to this place whenever I visit from the states again."}
{"text":"I feel bad for anyone who thinks that this place serves good pho.  The 'rare' beef was basically cooked, circular slices of almost-lunch-meat-grade beef and the stock was almost flavourless aside from the MSG. The beef balls were so puny... I've never actually seen balls that small (ha) so I guess this place was worth it just for the novelty of experiencing tiny, shrunken beef balls.  Please do yourself a favour and skip this place. There's lots of other good pho joints to enjoy in and around this area."}
{"text":"I always order their pho and spring rolls or vermicelli for pick up this place is my go to"}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go to Xe Lua next door, but it was closed for renovations until the 17th. On a whim, we went here instead.  I got the grilled chicken with rice. Unlike other Viet places, the dish didn't come with any fried egg, steamed egg, or shredded pork, which would have added a lot of variety and flavour to the dish. Upon taking a bite of the chicken, I immediately noticed something was off. It had a really weird texture, sort of like meat that haven't been cooked properly all the way through. Overall, the chicken was super flavourless, as was the accompanying fish sauce. The rice was on the mushy side and could have been cooked for a bit more as well. I honestly couldn't eat more than 5 or 6 bites.  We also got a vermicelli bowl (#216) and that wasn't great either. The fried spring rolls had a weird sour tang while the sausage had an almost pungent aftertaste that tasted stale and out of date. But hey, at least the tea was good?  Both of us felt a bit nauseous after leaving the restaurant. Definitely not a place I'd recommend for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite of pho on my way home. There's plenty of spots to choose from when you're in Chinatown and this was the closest to me. I ordered Pho with rare beef, beef brisket and beef flank. I really enjoyed the flavour of the broth, the beef was plentiful, and it seemed to me like they might make the noodles in house, but I never confirmed this. The service was quick and I paid $10 with tip for a very filling and delicious meal. I'll definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"The service was FAST. The vegetarian salad roll was delicious in that it was fresh and I LOVE the basil leaves in the roll. The dip was not peanut based but I think it was hoisin sauce. The vietnamese pancake sounded really appealing. I was about to get it if it were not for I had another meal waiting for me. Definitely recommend stopping here for meal even though next door"}
{"text":"Very good, very cheap! It deserves 5*!  All the friends I bring here - say that the pho is fabulous. My Vietnamese friend says that their Pho is excellent, and I can't agree more. I like this place more than pho hung. And it's a $1 cheaper for everything on their menu compared to the other places"}
{"text":"Hard to find Bun Rieu Oc (Shrimp & Crab paste vermicelli with escargot) in Mississauga, so was excited to try it out here. Add a bit of fish sauce in, and you best bet momma was a happy camper. Very busy and crampy, but the quick service surely makes up for it all."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a family member and our dinner experience was just ok.  Typical variety on menu as expected of a Vietnamese restaurant.  Order Pho and egg noodle soups.  Portions and pricing are fair, given the location; taste was satisfying.  Only minor annoyance is that the menu seems to be a bit dated as our bill prices did not perfectly match.  In hindsight, can only guess that the vague scratching out of various menu prices meant prices increases were being indicated.  Felt kinda ripped off..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a great dining experience. Unfriendly, unresponsive staff who became quite impatient when we asked questions about the menu. The table also wasn't clean, which wasn't great.  The food was not good. The broth didn't taste very good and the noodles weren't fully cooked. Some of the veggies were overcooked, and some were almost raw. The mint and sprouts that came with it were not fresh and seemed close to being off.   It also ended up being quite expensive, which we were not expecting."}
{"text":"Despite being very nearby, I ordered from this place on DoorDash. We had two orders of Bun Cha. The vermicelli noodles here are thicker than I am used to, but still delicious. Great option for no frills Vietnamese food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars in terms of service, I would. I was there yesterday and ordered \"curry chicken vermicelli\" under the vermicelli section. My food arrives and I get a bowl I did not expect. It was a curry chicken soup with fat vermicelli noodles. Since when did vermicelli come in soup? They did have a section that reads \"vermicelli soup\" so the appropriate place to put this dish would be under that umbrella. Even the pictures under the vermicelli section shows tradition, dry noodle vermicelli with vegetables. When I asked about my order, the owner immediate yelled at me.. I'm a grown woman and I've never been spoken to in that manner from a stranger. On top of that, there were 3 other customers in the restaurant. What ever happened to customer service?   She was extremely offended when I suggested to her that the menu should be corrected because that item did not specify that it will be different from the other vermicelli dishes. When I told her that I order the same dish from other pho restaurants that serve curry chicken as stir fried on vermicelli, she insisted that I was lying. She was firm on not making me something else and told me that if I don't like the food here, I can pay for my dish, leave and never come back.. all the while yelling at me.. When I asked her if I was supposed to pay for something I am not going to eat she told me that I can take it to go. The issue here is that even if I took it to go, the food is not edible. The noodles were soggy from the start because the soup was really hot. They were literally deteriorating when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks. The curry was also low-grade as I did not taste any coconut (they claim to make their curry dishes with coconut milk.. not true) I wish I had taken a picture to upload along with this review.   All in all, extremely bad service. I left almost in tears. I sat there, paid for food that I didn't eat and left, while the owner and workers laughed and gossiped about me in Vietnamese. It's a shame that I won't be going back there, as my boyfriend and I visit this restaurant once in a while when our favourite pho restaurants in Chinatown are too busy/packed. We usually avoid this restaurant anyway because often times it reeks of heated fish sauce; not a pleasant atmosphere to breathe in, especially on a hot summer day. This occurs in the evening only I find, so I believe it is due to the cleaning and wiping down of counters with old rags (closing shop duties I suppose).   A different woman who works there took my cash and said thank you, looking very apologetic. She usually serves me when I visit. I was emotionally drained for the rest of the day and lost all appetite for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with a friend.  I didn't have their pho as I couldn't find any vegetarian options (they had pho with vegetables but wasn't in their vegetarian section so I assume it was probably made with meat broth).  I ordered the Chinese vegetables with stick noodles.  It tasted okay, but I found there was too much gravy and the noodles weren't dried out properly so it was really wet and the noodles were very soft.    What I did like about this place was that it was one of the cleaner and better decorated pho places I've seen.  Verdict: The food is average, but decor is good and ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"my go to pho place.  their broth is the best, better than tien thanh. I often find theirs watered down or less flavorful but bun Saigon? ohoho always a contentful meal, along with their smoothies which are so yummy!"}
{"text":"I had the absolute WORST vermicelli bowl here and I will not be returning. For a basic dish (cooked noodles a bit of grilled meat and fresh vegetables) you'd think this is a hard one to mess up right? Well they did. Meat looked old and greasy, sparse and they threw in a few shoots underneath a giant pile of fat white noodles and one chopped up spring roll with processed meat of some sort. It was gross and I've had this many times at other places without any issues. Service was sub average. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've been eating Vietnamese noodles for a long time. My ex wife cooked and all their friend cooked them. Once I put the doup in my mouth I can tell you what ingredient they missed and out in. Msg is definitely a factor. Too much oil and not enough bones.  The bowl I order was XL and yes the bowl is large and the food is little. The spring roll is ok. I would come back again especially the wife of the owner doesn't look and talk friendly. Bad business."}
{"text":"This is the best *overall* Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown.  The pho is average but the menu contains more options than others.  The rice and vermicelli dishes are all very good, as are the not-so-often-ordered (i.e. snail broth noodle soup, beef stew, banh xeo [coconut crepe], banh guon [steamed rice noodle], etc.  If you are looking for a bowl of pho, this might not be the best spot for you.  If you want to venture off the beaten path a little bit, then go here, turn to a random page and point to a dish!  Try the dinner for two with the spicy and sour soup and clay pot catfish, its fantastic."}
{"text":"I went into the restaurant and immediately the staff drops dishes on the floor so wasn't off to a great start. We sit down and look at the menu to see photos of the staff with an Obama impersonator in the restaurant so you can take that as you will.  I ordered the beef and springroll on vermicelli. The noodles were easily 3x the thickness of actual vermicelli, the beef was not seasoned at all and the spring roll was very easily the worst springroll I've ever had.   Another pretty weird thing was we were brought a teapot and teacups but it was filled with cold tap water...  Over all easily the worst vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to quite a few across different cities."}
{"text":"Service was decent and food arrived fairly quickly. The noise level coming from the owners was rather distracting when I came to visit. I wish they toned it down a bit, especially when there weren't many customers in at the time and they were the only people making loud noises. The food itself tasted home made. It wasn't amazing or anything - just average. Overall, it's a good place to stop by for some late night meals or if you want something to get made quickly if you're hungry and on the go."}
{"text":"Used to be the best Vietnamese Restaurant in China-Town, fairly cheap and decent portions, But on the last 2 or 3 visits, Ive noticed the portions have gotten smaller and smaller, and the amount of meat they have been putting in my vermicelli bowls has basically become 2 to 3 small pieces cut up! I have decided it is no longer worth the price, and quality has gotten worse! Shame as it was my go to place! (do they think customers wont notice if they start cutting back on Ingredients!)  -- went back, seems to have improved again --- fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and would call this my favourite pho restaurant in Toronto hands down. The broth is delicious, the environment in relaxed, and it fills me up every time. Love love love bun saigon!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I've had better Vietnamese and cheaper.  My expectations may have been set too high after reading all the reviews."}
{"text":"Despite not having Pho in its name, this place have the best Pho in Chinatown, great broth that isn't too light or rich. They also have a killer chicken pad thai. Admittedly it isn't the most authentic, but it's definitely worth a try.  Great little family owned Vietnamese restaurant. The place is tad dingy, but the food is great, and service is fast. Affordable too, especially for a broke student."}
{"text":"The problem with Bun Saigon isn't really with their food, but rather that there are multiple equally good or better Vietnamese places within a 2 minute walk.  Everything I've had here I would describe as entirely fine.  I'm not sure how I feel about the thicker noodles they use in their bún. Some of their less traditional dishes are almost good.  The atmosphere is decent and the staff are nice.  In terms of food, though, I'd rather walk up the street to Pho Hung (unless you're particularly bothered by uncaring to downright bad service and waitstaff).  If all I want is pho, I might hop across the street to Pho Ai My instead -- their broth is great.  If I want the best Vietnamese nearby, I'm walking a bit further up the street to Anh Dao.  Bottom line: you won't regret eating here, but you can probably do better."}
{"text":"I had just moved to Toronto, and was in search of the pho place that would receive my regular business. I was walking up Spadina when I stumbled upon this cozy pho restaurant and decided to give it a try. I looked over their menu and ordered my soup, but did not see the type of rolls I usually ordered so I asked the owner if it would be possible to make them. She smiled and said yes, she could do that and a few minutes later out came these delicious beef satay rice wraps, seasoned with cilantro, mint and basil and rice vermicelli. They were delicious. The next time I was there was a good couple months later, as my schedule didn't always allow me to be by when they were open. I walked in and right away the owner recognized me. On top of that, she remembered exactly what I had ordered-2 months ago! At first I didn't believe her, but when the order arrived and it was exactly the same thing I had ordered 2 months back, I was impressed. To this day I still get the same thing and she always remembers. If it weren't for her, I'd have no idea what number to order off the menu it's been so long since I've had to write it down.  Aside from the pho and rolls, the pad Thai is also good, as are the Bun dishes. Prices are very affordable, and the atmosphere has been upgraded since I first started going. Never a bad experience, definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"No toned down flavours here! We had the bun oc and bun rieu oc, and we were surprised how bold the flavours were, and how authentic everything tasted. Usually when we order bun rieu, we're disappointed by how bland the soup is, and how lacking the bowl feels overall, but here it was seasoned just right, and had a good amount of rieu, tofu, and cha. Very happy with our visit!"}
{"text":"Eh - it was alright.  I usually get dac biet pho as my litmus test - but I was hardcore craving Bun Bo Hue (BBH) and decided to roll the dice.  Now, the BBH was predictably limp - but I suppose 'not horrible' is really the best I could have hoped for from your standard 100 menu item Vietnamese restaurant.  It wasn't spicy at all - and I really had to add my own chilis.  I guess it's my fault for ordering BBH from any place that doesn't specialize in it.  To put it in perspective, it's like ordering xiao long bao from any joint that doesn't specialize in it.  You know it's going to kinda suck - but you order it anyways cuz you're craving it.  I realize that wasn't a really good analogy, but I can't think popular Western dish was the same cult following. Meh.  Anyways, the place seem alright - but ya, like most Vietnamese restaurants, just stick to the few dishes they do well."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times, can't believe this is my first time writing a review for it. The location is pretty small, usually not great for huge groups. The door to the restaurant has a mind of its own and it does get pretty chilly on those cold nights. The service is fast and quick, with eh okay customer service. Their menu is the best part... There is one page where the owner has their picture taken with an OBAMA look-a-like, made my day. The food is delicious, I've had all sort of items on the menu. I like their banh xeo (vietnamese crepe/pancake) and pho, it's a pretty decent size for the pricing in the Toronto's market."}
{"text":"Undoubtingly one of the best authentic Vietnamese spots in the downtown core. From their rice dishes to pho and bun. I always either get the bun bo hue here or the bun thit nguong. Only thing I wouldn't give this place a 5 star is their portion of food isn't quite what you'd expect for what you're paying other then that, food is spot on!"}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving bun rieu. When it came I was surprised that the bowl was so small! I had ordered a medium but the bowl is a size small at all other restaurants. I thought they gave me the wrong order but I looked around and that seemed like the normal size.   The dish tasted good but was extremely oily. I've tried bun rieu at a lot of places across Toronto and the GTA. This is definitely not the best but not the worst either. Good place for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Not the best place to get your Pho fix. It took awhile to get our orders, and servers were not very attentive. The \"XL\" Pho is more like a small portion served in a large bowl, not filling at all."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Quite surprised by this place. It's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in Chinatown, and there's a lot more variety here compared to other competitors in the area.  Design of the restaurant is quite standard, with not much decorations. They do have a TV at the front though. When I arrived on a Friday, the place wasn't too full, but it did fill up as the lunch hour continued.  I ordered the beef stew with rice stick noodle soup (hu tieu bo kho), as the photo image in the menu looked like the tomato broth was quite strong and filling. Sure enough, the broth was actually one of the better tomato soup bases I've had (and I've tried several). The noodle was of the pho kind, and it was decent for the price I paid.  Service is good for an Asian restaurant. They will greet you, politely ask you if you want tea, and generally show good courtesy. In my opinion, this is probably one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in the area, and I would highly recommend it if you're in Chinatown looking for good, cheap food."}
{"text":"Open late night, reasonable prices, classic garish Chinese decorations, quiet ambiance, tea on-demand. If you are looking for quick, then this is your spot.  I got the veggie dish (639) and shrimp cold rolls (616) the veggie dish was a bit small, but I feel this is a common experience in all Chinese restaurants.  I wish they would be less liberal on the sauce and more on the Chinese Bok Choy. The spring rolls... again, decent for the cost but they skimped on the actual shrimp which was sad. The Pho was again lacking in the protein department....  so the more I think of it, the more I realize that this spot may only be good because of its late hours and price....  not much else.  However, I'd be happy to hear otherwise!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I've found my new go-to place for viet food! To think it's been there the whole time, and it took a new sign and reno for me to forgo xue lua and try this place instead.  What we had - pho, spring rolls, and rice with pork chop, shredded pork, quiche and fried egg, and an avocado shake.  The spring rolls were deliciously crispy and had something different in the filling - I think it was either bean or nuts. In any case, I loved it.  The pho was also pretty good. I only tasted the broth and it was not as strong tasting as other places, but I liked the subtle flavour that didn't reek of MSG.  Finally the rice with pork chop was very good. They used the traditional sticky rice flavoured with garlic, and the pork was so juicy and perfectly cooked. With parents that grew up in Vietnam, I can say that this was a very authentic experience. Not to mention all the Vietnamese spoken all around me.  I also liked the decor. Unlike the other pho restaurants round it, they didn't try to make it sleek and trendy, which is invariably ruined by some flourescent blinking light. It was just very homey with paintings of traditional Vietnamese scenes.  Try it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bun rieu in the city.  If you don't know what bun rieu is, it is a soupy vermicelli dish with tomatoes, ground beef, seafood, and in this particular case, snails.  It is much more flavourful and a little more salty than pho.  Make sure to put plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables in to make the best of the dish.  Also tried their DIY fresh rolls and they are good.  It doesn't seem like this place opens as late as Pho Xe Lua (train pho next door)."}
{"text":"I went in, looked at the menu and immediately realised I knew less about Vietnamese food than the boots I was wearing.  I was even unsure about how to order, on the table before me was the menu and order pad and a pencil.  So with my pencil in one hand and palate in the other, I launched into a scribble-fest on the order sheet,  most everything listed being less than $4 I ordered a variety of items, well done beef pho,  the UK Yelpers rave about this stuff and to my eternal shame I hadn't tried it; Vietnamese spring rolls, at least one thing I recognise; stuff; more stuff; even more stuff.   The serving lady came up, looked at my order sheet, repeated the items and gave me a confused look.  In broken English, she conveyed that I had actually ordered enough food to sate the hunger of Ho Chi Minh City; I scaled back and settled on the pho and the spring rolls and the waitress said I should tell her if I was still hungry afterwards.  She walked to the bar counter spun around, sat down, stood up and walked back holding a pot of green tea, a bowl of pho, a plate of beansprouts and basil for the pho and a plate of deep friend spring rolls with a chilli fish sauce dip.  A few instructions on pho etiquette later and I was tucking in.    The fried spring rolls were a little oily, but crisp and a little spicey, the pho needed livening up with some chilli sauce and I additionally added some hoi sin as instructed in my pho etiquette lesson.  The thin slices of 'well done beef' were lightly cooked and had a skirt of fat on them.  I briefly wondered if the rare beef was just threatened with a pot rather than simmered in one.  My repast consumed, I was most definitely no longer hungry.  It was all pleasant rather than breath taking, what was good was the bill which including taxes and tip came to $12.  I can't give a comparative qualititive assessment of the pho, this being my first, but being a frequent visitor to Toronto, I'm not ruling out a rematch at this place."}
{"text":"Went on a hunt to find a restaurant that serves bun bo hue, and I must say that I was very disappointed.  Bun bo hue visually looked fine, but upon tasting it, the soup was VERY sour. Not knowing too much about my Vietnamese culture, I thought that it was perhaps a different style of the dish that I've never tried before. I've only had BBH from two places; my mom's house and a street vendor in my mother's hometown near Saigon. Both had a balanced taste of spicy, salty, and sour which I understood to be the norm.  I asked my mother about it when I got home and she told me that the BBH that I was served today possibly went bad and that's why it tastes so sour. I felt completely let down and insulted that they would serve an old dish like that. Never going back."}
{"text":"The standard late night viet place for all the night owls. This place won't let you down in terms of taste.   We have got wrong orders before but the service is prompt and the place is packed.   I highly recommend their drinks. I had their mango smoothie last time and it was delicious. I also hear their avocado shake is great   World star hip hop! Hahaha. Don't throw plates"}
{"text":"My experience here was fair.  I got the rare beef and beef ball pho.  The noodles were boring, there wasn't much seasoning or thought put into the recipe, and the \"beef balls\" (which were not prairie oysters) were inedible stiff spheres of blech.  But I only paid a few bucks and I was almost full afterward.  In fact I paid for mine and my friend's meal here and it was still MUCH cheaper than my lunch at Fresh.  So it may just be a matter of getting what you pay for...and they don't hype it otherwise.  I don't have any plan to go here again with so many other Vietnamese places within a block, but I wouldn't avoid this place either.  I'll just order something else from their encyclopedic menu."}
{"text":"I slipped in here for quick takeout after another one of my long walks back from the office, and just kept coming back. I now can say that this is one of my favourite takeout Vietnamese places in Toronto.   The vegetables are always fresh, the food is always tasty and honestly I found their Bun Cha meals to be tastier than Xe Lua (yes, I know it's sacrilegious to say that).  For a place that's so cheap, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth in flavours.  The service is alright and they serve the meals quickly (but not too quickly, if you know what I mean). I can't say that I'd sit down for a meal there. Typically I find their TVs playing loudly whatever is on CBC (hurray Dragon's Den...) and the restaurant is your typical casual Chinatown restaurant. It's not the most fancy place, but it's good for a lunch sit down."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant de quartier. Sobre. Cuisine correcte. Bonne adresse. Les assaisonnements gagneraient à être rafraichis."}
{"text":"Nice Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown. I was craving some bun reiu and this was the first place that popped up. They have two versions of the bun reiu, the standard fixings and one with added snails for .50 more. The normal fixings include ground crab, crab tofu, crab cake, pork blood, green onions and some cilantro in a tomato broth. Bun reiu is served with a side of cabbage, bean sprouts and a line that you can add to your noodle bowl for more crunch.  The bowl isn't that big but it taste like what I expected from bun reiu. Service is quick but like any Asian restaurant, non existent after serving you. They provide hot tea when you are seated, menu, pen and paper to put your order in."}
{"text":"Location: Convenient, underground parking close by 5* Authentic: 4* Service: average 2.5* Cleanliness: below average 2* Price: average 2.5*; portion is quite small for the price   Not recommended to visit"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night. The place is well lit and clean. It's different from most pho restaurants downtown is that it has tv's.  I had a durian milkshake and grilled porkchops on rice for dinner. The drink was bigger thna I'm used to and the durian flavour was strong/flavourful. The main was big and came with a bowl of broth. I didn't care much for the broth hut it tasted okay, had a scent of sweetness to it. The porkchops were juicy, tender and tasty. They had grilled marks and tasted like it was made to order - plus there wasn't a lot of fat.  I would probably go here now for rice instead of pho train"}
{"text":"Pretty good pho place with lots of other options. Seems rwally authentic. The get the food to us pretty quick. Pretty stabdard for ohi but one of the better tasting broth."}
{"text":"The pho here is average.  The noodles here are on the thinner size instead of the huge flat noodles that resemble ho-fun.  They can improve on the amount of meat provided. There's a slight price to product mismatch and there are only 2 sizes for their pho: medium & XL. The medium is like a small (in comparison to Scarborough joints) and the XL seemed like an in-between of a medium and a large.  The soup is a little bland but can be corrected with the hot sauce and black pepper provided on the side.  But the virgin soup isn't exactly bursting with flavour.  The service here is efficient but not very friendly.  I'll try the rest of the pho restaurants on Spadina before I return.  (However, this is the only one that I've seen so far that takes VISA)."}
{"text":"Had a decent lunch here today.   Giant typical Vietnamese menu with all your regular pho, vermicelli and rice dishes.   I picked the pho bo ga (beef and chicken). The broth was delicious and didn't leave me with that bloaty MSG feeling after eating which was a good sign. I didn't like the beef used in the pho - it had wayyyyy too much fat on it which wasn't very well cooked. Raw fat, yuck.   The fresh rice paper shrimp rolls here were giant and very good.  Prices very reasonable, most main dishes $6-$7.   Service very fast and portions huge."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad and the employees are nice, it's just that there are so many other good places in Toronto Chinatown...   The pho broth did not have much of a flavor. Sauce for pork and shrimp rolls looked and tasted like hoisin sauce with sprinkles of peanuts. Noodles were properly prepared and meats were good."}
{"text":"Came here late one night with some friends who said that this restaurant was their favourite Vietnamese place in Chinatown - I must agree with this assessment. I had the vermicelli bowl here (#216 with grilled pork, spicy pork and a spring roll) and it was delicious.  The spring roll was nice and crunchy and I really liked the spicy pork, which was basically a spicy pork sausage and full of flavour.  The portions are very generous and the best part, they use the thicker rice vermicelli for their bowls (vs the standard thin vermicelli you get at most places)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first couple lunches here last year, but I have been here a couple times this past few months and I have been highly disappointed.  I used to like their Special Spicy Pho Soup (I forgot what it was called exactly), which had a rich and hearty spicy red broth and assorted meat. My recent experiences with this same dish has been pretty bad. The broth was completely different, it seems like they didn't even bother to make it and took their regular pho and added a ton more fish sauce and extra chili. The fish sauce overpowered the meal and there wasn't that rich red soup appearance, and it wasn't even spicy. I had to add a lot more chili and Siracha sauce to give it some flavor and to mask the overwhelming fishy funk.  Another thing about this place which annoys me is that the restaurant owners look after their young kids in the restaurant on the weekends who takes over the large table in the back. They are often loud and they play children's television shows on all the TVs in the restaurant with the volume on pretty high even though their kids barely pay attention to it. This creates a very irritating environment in the restaurant. I have nothing against kids, but this is a restaurant and it's not fair to the kids to be couped up in a restaurant all day long and having the customers put up with them.  My last visit here a few weeks ago there was a very unusual smell in the restaurant which I found a little off-putting. There was a strong wicker/rattan/dried flower smell that was unpleasant and I couldn't figure out where it came from or what it was caused from. Also the cleanliness has also gone downhill, as the tables and chairs felt a little sticky and I found large hair balls that gathered around the chair legs (see photo).  I love Vietnamese coffee, and unfortunately here the characteristic stainless steel coffee filters they have were heavily clogged and not cleaned well so I didn't enjoy my coffee the way that it should.  The only good thing I could say about Bun Saigon was that the food came out very fast, but that is pretty common for most Vietnamese restaurants.  With all of these problems this restaurant has I will definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I patron this Vietnamese restaurant every time I get a craving for Vermicelli.  This place has the best Vietnamese food in Chinatown!  #219 is my fav and is a healthy portion.  I have converted many people to this joint and many of them eat there for lunch, with or without me.  Lunch on the weekday is always busy so try to go before the lunch rush hits.  The food comes out quick so it makes for a good lunch venue."}
{"text":"Good service, taste, portions and price. Nothing fancy. Unpretentious.   I had the pho and enjoyed it. My date had the beef stew/noodle thing. Both were good and I would go back next time I am in toronto.  Price was about $7; similar to every other place in Chinatown."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their pho!! I ordered the house special and I thought their soup base was a bit fatty and tasteless than the ones I had at other places. Nonetheless I like that this pho place is reliable to come here after a long night out partying or clubbing. Good for people who want food after drinking/clubbing!! Def a spot to spot rowdy crowds of people after 2 am.   Last tip?   The noodles you get here are slightly different than the noodles you get at a typical pho place. The noodles are fresh noodles and a bit fatter than the noodles you get at other pho places. Try it yourself and see!"}
{"text":"This was the first time me and my family have been to Bun Saigon. We've eaten downtown plenty of times but for some reason never dropped by this place before. If our family friends didn't invite us to this restaurant then we probably wouldn't know about it.  The restaurant has a modern decor look to it...they probably renovated before. The restaurant is kinda small and there were 9 of us in total. The table was a bit small for all of us and there was water dripping from the ceiling where me and my sister were sitting. So when the food came I decided to eat at a separate table where there wasn't water dripping from the ceiling.  I had the banh cuon (summer roll) and bun bo hue (mild). The banh cuon was yummy and we all finished it before the main course arrived. The main course took a while but we didn't mind because we were all chatting away. The bun bo hue tasted delicious however it was still spicy because my nose was running like crazy and I finished an entire glass of water. That didn't keep me from finishing off my dinner though =P. While everyone had received their food, my mom was still waiting on her banh canh. So if you want to feel left out while everyone is slurping away, I wouldn't suggest ordering banh canh...unless you want to wait a while.   Overall, Bun Saigon is good for their bun bo hue and banh cuon (can't really judge anything else because that's what I only ate). However, the slightly slow service, drippy ceiling, and expensive (for a Viet place), turned me off."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when Im craving home cooked Vietnamese dishes.  I like the vermicelli bowls and pho, also the spring rolls are delicious."}
