{"text":"One of my favorite dessert spots. Unique decor and yummy treats! Awesome central location and fast service. I would recommend the Sesame Street snoh treat. Magically delicious."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and their teas/slush/ice cream is amazing! I wish I would have been able to find this place earlier..."}
{"text":"I love this alternative to ice cream and froyo. I love the taro and condensed milk glaze. The topping can be interchangeable. So far I really love it with almonds cause I love the crunch. The shaved ice is great cause it isn't too heavy and it's just sweet enough. This place is definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always order whatever they recommend and it is delicious.  They have interesting art, plenty of seating, and great service"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already In a row. I loved it the first time. I was searching for a new place to get ice cream but it is better than ice cream. Fast service and reasonably priced ! It will not disappoint you, the minute you walk in it already looks amazing."}
{"text":"Never had anything like it. Very impressed with the different spin on shaved ice,  lots of variety,  swanky and new decoration.  Date night worthy. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I didn't know what the concept was at first, but then I ate it and thought it was really cool. It isn't shaved ice, it is a lighter version of that. It is very light shaved ice. I always get the strawberry, with Oreos and nutella. It is amazing!! I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious. I thought it was actually pretty big for a small, but would be good for sharing. Also got a thai iced tea with boba. The boba has great consistency and tastes just right."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out and enjoy some sweet treats. I usually come here for the Snoh. It's a light and fluffy shaved ice with very unique Asian influenced flavors. I've tried the taro, thai, green tea, and mango snow so far. All delicious, but I do favor the thai tea and taro with mochi toppings and a black sesame drizzle. I have yet to taste their drink selection though."}
{"text":"The most delicious thing I've ever had  kind of expensive but I think it's worth it. Very busy but fast service and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I've been to Snoh quite a bit and absolutely love it. There is always something great for my kids, me, my spouse, and my friends. In my experience, the owner is very considerate and willing to take the time to make sure newbies know all the options. I just took a friend there today and she adored it. Great food, friendly staff, wonderful vibe."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I figured I needed to just get this out there as it really has bugged me...  My friend and I walked in there (we had came over from next door), to see what this place was all about. We got a long drawn out explanation as to what it was and we were really pressured to buy one to try and not just that, but to get a large!!! I was really put off by the salesman \"pushing\" of the product so much so that we just decided to leave! I really wish they would at least give a sample to try rather then some overly-dramatized-your-life-will-be-forever-changed-just-buy-it speech..I hope that maybe in the future this place learns to be a little more laid back with how they first present themselves to new customers, otherwise this stuck up intimidation is going to just turn away a lot more customers.   Ill stick to Tea Snow in Mesa (you are not the only Asian shaved ice place in Az as your pompous salesperson claims either)..."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!! Snoh has a cool little vibe going on. The shop itself has cool art work and books to read. I got the Coconut Snoh with no topping and it was like eating a little bowl of heaven. I don't know if I liked the novelty of it's snow like texture or if I liked the fact that it was just that dang good. Regardless, it's definitely not a snow cone. If you want something a little different you might want to check this place out."}
{"text":"Dear Nice Folks at Snoh,  If you look into the till, you'll see that you have a lot of my cash. Not that you'd be able to tell it apart from the cash from your other loyal customers, but it's there nonetheless. Personally, I blame you all for putting in such a nice, comfy, artsy hangout spot with delicious Taiwanese-style ice. I blame you for making such delicious thai tea flavored Snoh that now I have a full-on addiction. I don't know if there's SA (Snoh Anonymous) but I'm sure if such a thing existed, I'd be on the roster.   I'm a longtime customer of Cherry Blossom/Tokyo Express and had been wondering about this new joint setting up shop next door. At the recommendation of my friends (one of whom is in the frozen yogurt biz), I came in to try Snoh and now I feel like Frosty the little freakin' Snoh-Elf. My favorite is the thai tea Snoh with boba and condensed milk (or black sesame glaze). My favorite thing is that when the the milk tea Snoh melts, BOOM! You got milk tea! It's a two-fer!  Anyhoozle, thanks to the nice folks at Snoh for opening their doors just as the weather is heating up. Prep the till, gentlemen, more of my cash is going to be making its home there this Summer!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Amazing flavor combinations and great service! Cold weather or Hot, you can't deny the warm atmosphere. Love it, will always come back!"}
{"text":"The snow was kind of watery but considering this was the first time I've had snow, it was good. Decently price. I also had the regular milk tea with boba on a different day. The boba was very soft and chewy= perfect. The drink itself, however, was too watered down. I had them remake it thinking it was a fluke (they did claim they have San Gabriel Valley, CA standards) but it tasted the same.   If you're from CA: pass on the milk tea, try the snow (I haven't had class 302 so I don't know how it compares to it)  The owner and staff there is super nice, I hope they improve their milk tea flavoring, I'm willing to come back and support them!"}
{"text":"I'm from Taiwan, where boba milktea originated from. I can speak with confidence that SNOH has the most genuine boba milktea I've ever had in Arizona. Besides that, all of my friends who have tried their Taro Snoh agreed that it tastes just like what we had back in Asia!  SNOH is absolutely a worth-trying dessert place with amazingly genuine products :-)  We accidentally visited SNOH during their first week of opening...it's love at first taste. Till now, I'm still willing to drive all the way from Tempe for a cup of taro Snoh with mochi balls; I never get disappointed by any of their products (the latest pumpkin flavor Snoh is awesome); I can never get tired of spreading good words about SNOH; and I've just made my first Yelp review for SNOH :-D"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I eat shaved snow a lot. SNOH kept it real and their flavors were great! We ordered every flavor and I have to say I really like the Green Tea. Definitely get boba and egg pudding with the green tea, it tastes amazing!   I docked off a star because the mochi was a little too hard for my taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I love that they have a variety of things to do there while you're hanging out having a good time! My daughters have so much fun whenever we play UNO or connect four a while were eating our shaved ice !  I'm super excited about heading to the downtown location this weekend! I hope they have a vendor at the downtown public market as well!"}
{"text":"I love this kind of snow shaved ice since I tried it oversea years ago.  I am glade to reunite with it again.  Tried the green tea flavor with almond pudding, boba, and black sesame glaze. Though they still put the glaze over the ice when I asked to have it on the side, it was not over powering or over sweet. Snow texture is right. Pudding is good. Boba was old, too sweet, and somehow stick together like an army instead of individual ball. They told me the price for just the ice without any topping or any glaze would be the same. Which is $7 for a large. I think it's kinda pricy for just plain plate of shaved ice.   Will go back for sure, just cause it's hot out there and that's one refreshing happy treat for me~"}
{"text":"I went there a lot and really like this place for the shaved ice.I did try the green milk tea before it tastes well but I ordered no ice for this time it tastes like watery I asked them why they said no ice they added water..it did taste like a milk plus water plus sugar .they can charge more money for no ice but add water is really bad for the taste .nobody want to spend 4 dollars plus get a tea tastes like watery...really disappointed"}
{"text":"Their Thai teas and bobas are amazing! This is my new favorite spot I will be definitely coming back! I always thought there wasn't a lot of good boba shops in Phoenix until a friend recommended me here and they are perfect"}
{"text":"\"Snoh way anything frozen can taste this good!\"    Selfishly I don't want to recommend this place because of the possibility of making this so popular that I worry that there wouldn't be enough supply for my demand.  However my rating would suffice in this easy recommendation.  One of the easiest description to this would be frozen cotton candy.  The uncanny fluffiness to this desert marvel topped with fruit toppings and condensed milk is a taste you'll be back for more. This is simply a no-brainer during 115 degree weather, but the shaved ice is a treat you worth having even during cold days of Arizona.  Though I haven't tried the Snoh drinks, I would give it a try at my next stop.    Service is friendly and they make good recommendations.  The place with it's trendy decor, Instagram artwork and Flat screen TVs adds to your visual stimulation as you wait for your desert.  I would opt for the large size in a dish with split flavors with original and something you're willing to try.    My only hope is that my fantastic review doesn't get lost in the \"filtered\" black hole of reviews for the site.  If you find this useful, funny, or cool please check accordingly."}
{"text":"The tea was great so give on that but the boba was too firm. Might of just been that day so definitely don't let this review stop you from trying it out. Plus there desserts definitely looked five star so I will be back for that."}
{"text":"this place doesn't even deserve one star. if you've had snoh anywhere else, you would know this is not good quality. on top of the lack of taste, their service is TERRIBLE. I waited 30 mins for a cup of water and left because I never received it. Workers were rude and ignored my request multiple times. save yourself the trouble and money, don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Never been there until today and I gotta say I'm impressed. I've been to many boba tea places and I've never seen the \"snoh\" shaved ice before. It's delicious. I wish they would have a blended menu, however, it was an overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would.  The people were rude. My slushy was more like an icy and when I asked for it to be remade they went to the back and brought out the same drink. Never again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get refreshing milk tea and slushies! The pistachio flavor is very yummy. Small place but it has a great atmosphere. It does tend to get busy later in the day but with their downtown location it's helped the overflow of people."}
{"text":"Snoh is the perfect place to escape the heat and try something new! The flavors and texture of their shaved ice is unlike anything I've had before and there is no better place for it in AZ!   I love the taro root and original flavors, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. I was iffy on the black sesame sauce the first time I tried it, but I am now converted into a fan.  Condensed milk and caramel are delicious as well. Staff is always very nice and there are comfy chairs and even games to play if you want to hang out for awhile."}
{"text":"Love Snoh!  Cute ice cream shop and i love their #12!.. It's so yummy & chewy.  I only give 4 stars, because it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this place, I thought the atmosphere was weird and try hard. I ate outside with my fiancé because we both didn't want to be in there. Also, I don't think it's appropriate for your employees to be showing there whole stomach in a short cropped top. I get that this is a \"hipster\" place but be a little more professional. After I saw her skimpy outfit I lost my appetite. I wasn't even in the shop that long to hear at least 10 curse words. This place is extremely unprofessional and i will never be coming back. Also the texture of the snow was just not for me, I found it okay but mainly disgusting all together. Too expensive also! Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Let a line of 8 ppl build up with nobody at the register. No employee in sight. Somebody finally found a bell and they came out, but really 8 ppl?! I got a strawberry iced tea. Tasted like flowers."}
{"text":"Best ever, amazing, addicting! It is so different from shaved ice and so addicting! I come way too often!"}
{"text":"My favorite! The employees are always so nice and easy going. The mango slushie with boba is my fave! This location is always busy, but the service is always fast!  Also love the rewards program."}
{"text":"It was good, I would go back, but not doing cartwheels over it. Can't really go wrong with what u order unless you're a picky eater. The staff could be a bit more descriptive about the flavors, taste and what the hell you're eating."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Snoh was an average experience. The selection was short and sweet, that's what I like most. The ice shavery is light and good. The owners need to work on their customer service though.The individual at the cash register was very friendly but the other two just stare at you and very discourteous. I wouldn't come here again until it improves.  I also ordered half green tea and half Thai and they only gave me Thai."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to kick back and enjoy a light treat. The employees are so friendly and helpful with suggestions. By far my favorite dessert place."}
{"text":"I visited Snoh when I was passing through AZ-- and I'm drooling just thinking about it. I went there after a few drinks so I had no idea what I was ordering. I had never tried (or heard of) Thai snow, or taro snow, or mochi balls or boba-- and I never had shaved ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I fell in love, and the love quickly turned into sadness because I couldn't believe I was missing out all this time. I started taking pictures of everyone's ice cream for sweet memories."}
{"text":"Snoh has the best shaved ice in all of Phoenix. Sadly my boyfriend doesn't like shaved ice so I don't get here enough :(. I'm OBSESSED with the taro shaved ice! The toppings are also absolutely amazing (yum, condensed milk and mochi!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their milk teas with boba but lately they haven't been steady in quality. The boba last night wasn't ready and came out hard. I went last week and the boba again had an issue, it was tasteless. I hope they can find a way to serve consistent products."}
{"text":"First visit was last night, last visit was last night.   Interesting idea but flavor was lacking compared to other frozen desserts.  Real snow may have more flavor.  I selected a basic mix using the original shaved ice with oreo's and chocolate topping.  The guy behind the counter thought it was so funny he called out to some friends sitting at a nearby table to share my order with them so everyone could have a good laugh at my expense. WOW, great customer service.   Between the insulting customer service and plain tasting dessert, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Snoh is an excellent concept for the Arizona heat & those who are looking for a way to treat themselves without all the guilt. The place has a very hip ambiance (lots of fun stuff to look at while you have desert), it's clean, & the staff is very friendly. I HIGHLY recommend the Taro flavor with Oreo cookies, sesame glaze, & whatever else you're into for toppings. I purchased a small & got back in line to purchase a regular haha I never do that but I was excited about my new find...mmmm fluffy texture & great flavor"}
{"text":"I love Snoh! Me and my brothers go every chance we get. I always end up ordering 2/3 different items off the menu. The owner is the greatest and sweetest guy you will meet. Snoh is the must try place and hot spot to be at. Really worth it!"}
{"text":"Frequented Snoh since they opened for their teas and boba, and was always pretty bummed that they didn't have a dairy free option for me to try.   BUT NOW THEY DO!!  The coconut milk snoh is amazing. Creamy and light all at once (its magical!), with a whole bunch of toppings and glaze options.   Their teas are super yummy and I love that they actually carry boba! My husband is obsessed with the taro milk tea.   Their loyalty/stamp card is one of the few that I always remember to bring in my wallet. Yay for free snoh!  Only a few bummers to be aware of-  They always seem to be out of at least one flavor whenever I go in.   Parking sucks. They share a lot with several other businesses/restaurants that is barely big enough for them alone. Not their fault, but something to remember. Carpool.   Can't tip on a card =("}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!!! I always get the taro and honeydew or pistachio plus strawberries and mango or mochi balls with condensed milk!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I wanted some dessert, and my friend hyped up this place completely, she was like, \"we have to go it's so worth it\" and our asses were on the other side of town, but we wanted to complete this mission. So we went ahead and went. First off, the smell was amazing! I think it was the toast that they were making that smelled AMAZING. it smelled delicious! I wanted to buy one, but I had to stick to what they're made for. Oh! And it's right next to the Cherry Blossom Cafe, my fave restaurant. Anyways back to this review! The atmosphere and the music was so so so so cute! They had sick paintings and decor! And the music had my head  bobbing all while I was there. They had a Toro light switch in the bathroom, it was so cute. AND it smelled good! As for customer service, I had nothing to complain about, they were so nice! Now I was really confused on what I wanted so my friend told me to get regular snow, which I completely regret getting. Do NOT get regular snoh! Please! It'll taste like... Ugh just regular ice! I was eating ice w caramel, graham crackers and Oreos ._. I was mad, but I still ate it. I feel like if I would have Gotten an actual flavor I would have love love loved. but why would someone recommend ICE flavored snoh? Anyways, I'm definitely coming back. Just not for ice flavored snoh lmao."}
{"text":"Best shaved ice in town! The only down fall today was the guy at the register today had like an attitude today or something. I didn't get his name but he had tattoos and an LA hat on. Other than that the taro snoh was really good. Also, i had a strawberry iced tea. Great after taste."}
{"text":"The only thing I have negative to say about Snoh is the fact that I have to drive so far to get some!  Awesome selection of shaved ice options, great people and service with a fun atmosphere to enjoy your delicious and cool treat!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I thought I was in for a treat, however the snoh dessert I got was not very tasteful. It was a bland mix of fruits and really left me yearning for another place to cure my craving. I'm sure there are people who will love this place however it is not for me."}
{"text":"Love this place! Chic, cute with some Asian deco elements, and the most important, the shaved ice is so yummy!!!  3 of us came after a Saturday brunch, ordered a large size of Taro and Original shaved ice, paired with sweet red beans and mango fruit (they also offer mango jelly), and topped with caramel drizzle. Maybe because of our choice, this plate was very very sweet. If you don't like sweet that much, choose something different. The large size was definitely enough for 3 of us! The shaved ice was very fine, fluffy and felt like cotton candy! And as it melts, it seems to be more like ice cream than ice. The texture is very different from the other shaved ice I have tried where you can feel more of the ice.   If Snoh was not 20 miles away from me, i would visit at least once a week! Can't wait for the next visit :)"}
{"text":"The snow was great. Boba had a good constancy. I'd come back again for the snow, but definitely not for the service. The cashier guy with the tattoos was rude."}
{"text":"Very innovative \"ice cream\".  They have great boba too!!  Love it."}
{"text":"BEST SNOH IN THE WEST COAST  \"!!! If you've never tried it you're in for a great treat. Bypass the ice cream and try something new great date place. Tried other places but there is no competition when it comes to this place. Love it love it love it"}
{"text":"This is our favorite icecream shop in Phoenix! We get the taro snoh with strawberries, red beans or mochi with condensed milk. Our almost 2 year old says \"yummy\" after each spoonful of snoh! I say yummy to their house blend milk tea with a scoop of icecream."}
{"text":"Let it Snoh, Let it Snoh, Let it Snoh!   This place is has a cool vibe to it..... the ambiance is chic, the place is modern/clean, and they should just install a revolving door in front with the amount of traffic they get at this place!  Seriously, there's always a line when we visit - but it's worth the wait!   The flavored snoh they create are so fine it's almost like eating ice cream instead of shaved ice.  They have quite unique flavors, toppings, and glazes.... from the traditional green tea ice with red bean and condensed milk (one of my favorite combinations) to the more westernized strawberry snoh with fresh strawberries and chocolate glaze, there's quite a range of combinations that can be had.   We've also tried their boba, thai tea, taro snoh, mochi, sesame glaze.... all yummy in various combinations! Now, if they would only open a location closer to where I live so I don't have to drive 15 miles to play with snoh......"}
{"text":"I think the boba drinks and snow are decent.  I just think the manager/owner, or whoever he is, is a bit pompous and frankly a bit rude.  From what I've read it is a fairly common experience/behavior.  I'll probably end up going again b/c it's close to Cherry Blossom but I would think twice about going in if I saw him working."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here on Saturday. Cute little shop lots of seating and great artwork! I had the milk snoh with boba, moochi, and condensed milk. Loved it, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Finally, a good boba place in Central Phx! I'm giving it four stars for not having more tea flavors (there's only about 4 flavors each for milk tea and for regular tea) but overall I've enjoyed the boba teas I've tried there.  I personally like their Thai tea and Taro tea - have not tried the Almond or Milk tea flavors.  I've tried the snoh but I'm not as big a fan as I am of boba in general.  I like that the boba has been consistently chewy every time I order it and that the tea is well mixed - no granules at the bottom of my cup.  My husband can't bring himself to deviate from the snoh - he mixes it up all the time, but he tends to get the thai snoh or the original flavor and puts mochi, strawberries, and black sesame glaze.  We love the location (super enabling since it's 10 mins away from our place) and usually don't have to wait too long for our order.  It's in the same center as Cherry Blossom Cafe, Tokyo Express, and a few other relatively busy places, so parking can be a premium at peak food times.  We've usually gone on the weekend or towards the end of the day and have only had a problem finding a spot once or twice.  Try not to look for a spot in the front - go to the left and park towards the back.  You'll get your fix faster and with less stress!"}
{"text":"My bf and I just recently moved to AZ and we were on a hunt to find the best dessert place in town. Snoh Ice Shavery easily became one of our favorites. We even brought family and friends when they visited us and they loved it too. My favorite thing to order is Taro snoh with some mochi, custard pudding, and honey boba, glazed with condensed milk. It's making my mouth water just thinking about it lol"}
{"text":"A new favorite in Phoenix! Was craving for Boba and stopped in. The menu is just the right size. Not too many selections to confuse, but enough to satisfy. Had the passion fruit and lychees Boba with half the sugar. Made just right at a great price!  What a great find in Phoenix. Going to try the shaved ice next."}
{"text":"Snoh is the antidote to summer in Phoenix. Cool and fun inside with so many available combinations of Snoh, add ins and toppings. It's almost as much fun to imagine the creations as it is to eat it! Snoh is a flavored milky ice shaved in sheets to a soft, noncrunchy consistency.   We had strawberry with lychee jelly and condensed milk (quite sweet,) a Gotcha Matcha (matcha with red beans and mochi topped with condensed milk -regular size was pretty darn big,) and a #8 pistachio, custard jelly with almonds and a little caramel. Each one was finished until it looked like we had licked the bowls!   Cold and custom made so you can tailor the amount of sweetness to your palate. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked!   I searched far and wide for a Boba tea joint in the valley. This seems to be the only one and it isn't a bad thing. The boba is fresh and flavorful and the Thai tea is delicious!  The \"snoh\"  is a very unique cold dessert. It is light like cotton candy, but creamier than shaved ice. It's a perfect fit for somebody who is trying to find a new way to relieve themselves from the brutal Arizona summer.   I recommend trying out the combinations that they have on the rolling display first to find your taste and go from there.   You can't go wrong with anything at his place. Some of the ingredients sound foreign but I haven't had something yet that tastes bad. Find your flavor baseline and you will never go back. I am done with froyo, Hawaiian ice and Gelato as long as I stay within driving distance from my new found frozen obsession, Snoh."}
{"text":"Not my cup of Snoh. I tried the number 8; pistachio Snoh, pudding, caramel, and sliced almonds. The sliced almonds were the only thing I could taste. Everything else was bland and just tasted sweet. Too sweet that I couldn't finish my small cup.  Not worth the calorie consumption. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Snoh is delicious!   Interesting flavors and toppings. This spot is clean and hip. Owner is cool and helpful when you aren't sure what you want!  Definitely give this place a try!  Green tea with lychee jelly glazed with condensed milk - YUM!  Give it a try!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Tastes better than the same old frozen yogurt and appears to be more healthy (depending on syrups and toppings of course)."}
{"text":"Would love to give this place a higher review because their boba and thai tea are the best in town. But service weighs more to me than the taste. The owner is unpleasant, rude and does not treat his regulars or even customers with respect."}
{"text":"Best shaved ice desserts ever!!! Also their milk tea with boba is awesome and you can get it blended! The milk tea smoothie tastes awesome just like the milk tea place at pikes place in Seattle!!!! Definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I will definitely admit i am here every week. I come here for the boba, because it is not only like the only boba place in central phoenix but their boba is perfectly cooked (IMO) 98% of the time. Strawberry tea and thai tea, both with boba, every visit. Occasionally, we will have a small cup of shaved iced.  Drinks/Boba - excellent  Shaved ice (condensed milk!!!!!) - excellent  Brick toast (around $10) - ehhh, pass  Atmosphere - super chill, board games, Nintendo, etc  Art - awesome, local  It's always busy here but they bust out orders pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the service by Judith and Kim was excellent they have good recommendations, it's a great place to chill and have your favorite drink, the only reason I give it five stars is because I can't give it six it's simply dope."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get dessert. It's really nice with a refreshing Asian theme. There's nothing quite like it I've ever seen. Would recommend to anyone that loves good quality."}
{"text":"Look forward to coming back to this amazing not to mention yummy in your tummy spot! Not only is it tasty the staff if friendly too just wish they had a larger sitting area at times :)"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place to go to with friends; I love the tea and yogurt!!!  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So delicious. I live down the street and I can't help but go every time I have a spare minute! I always get thai tea snoh with green tea mochi balls and black sesame, I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Very cool (no pun intended) way to enjoy something nice and cold on a hot day that isn't ice cream. The staff is awesome and happy to help you create yummy combinations."}
{"text":"I don't know honestly what to say, because you have to honestly try it yourself to experience how amazing this ice/cream/but not the two combined in a way lol, thing is. Holy cow the first bite was simply mouthwatering for more. It's an amazing deal with a huge amount for a small at $4.00 and only 50 cents per extra topping. Free glaze of course. Support local business by trying this crazy good dessert!!"}
{"text":"I love Boba and always like trying new places, but Snoh Ice Shavery has the worst customer service i've experienced in all Boba shops in Phoenix! To start off the Asian guy with the tattoos that looks like he's in his 20's, was soo rude! I came with my non- english speaking mother and while I was translating her order he gave us the wierdest looks, not to mention that since it was my first time there he was being a sarcasstic asshole when I asked what they had on the menu! I was so outraged!!! He then aggressively handed me the cups like as if he never had someone ask about the menu? He did this to us but not to the WHITE or ASIAN customers. Never coming to this place again and I definitely told my friends about the wonderful experience I had here ! BTW and the Boba didn't even have any flavor it tasted so watery as did the snoh! I'm sticking on going to BOMBOBA their customer service is 1000x better than this shit."}
{"text":"This was our first time there tonight and it was amazing. The gentleman was very patient as my daughters didn't know what they wanted. It was great. I would highly recommend it. Prices were decent too."}
{"text":"We have been here three times in two weeks if that's any indication of how much we love this place. I gotta admit I was a bit weary and it intimated by the crazy look and unfamiliar flavored but now they are flavors I know and love. Take the leap. I didn't think anything could be better than ice cream but apparently I was wrong."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  I wished I remembered what I got......but it was good.  Different product and they did a great job on the remodel.  I didn't expect to find this venue in this center."}
{"text":"I love this place! Unique flavors, glazes, and toppings. I love the Thai Tea with sweetened, condensed milk glaze and boba! Delicious. My only reason for a 4 star instead of 5, is the service was SLOW!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here via Groupon because the concept was so intriguing! We were not disappointing and will be returning. You should go if you like Thai flavors and desserts with a bit of a twist. Funky pictures and atmosphere. Cool!"}
{"text":"I know when I first looked at the pictures they did NOT look appetizing. Boy was I wrong.  It's such a good creamy treat that's still really light. Great assortment of flavors, I'm a fan of the taro and Thai tea.  The topping offerings are also good-- sesame seeds, almond yogurt, boba, coconut jelly, CONDENSED MILK!!! If you don't know what condensed milk is, try it with the taro shave ice and put that on top. It will change your life.  It's really unfortunate that I live so close to this place... for my wallet and my belly."}
{"text":"Snoh is interesting in that it is really, one of a kind. At least here in the valley. It's taiwanese shaved ice, where they freeze blocks of this stuff and shave it in delicate layers into your bowl. The first (and only time) prior to Snoh I'd had it up in the Bay area, and was smitten. Fluffy! Sweet! Cold! Just perfect for summer!  So this is kind of what you can expect, with regards to Snoh. You walk in, and up along the wall there's a menu. You pick what flavor of Snoh you want, and then you can pick toppings. There are solid ones, and liquid flavor ones as well. Then you wait for them to make it. They'll call your name and you come up to collect your very own Snoh concoction!   For example, the first time I went to Snoh I picked a mango flavored Snoh, with red bean and mochi toppings, and condensed milk on top. The last time I went with my husband we got a thai iced tea Snoh, with cinnamon toast crunch and mochi, and a condensed milk topping. Pretty straightforward. As a heads up, the size of what you get will dictate how many toppings you get, though I'm sure you could get more toppings and pay for that as well. We got regulars both times, which will give you two toppings and one liquid one. It's pretty huge, more than enough to share between two people.   It really is mindblowing. It's so fluffy and ephmeral. It's not dense, not in the least bit, and you'll find yourself going through this enormous bowl quite easily. As new as this business is, when we went in this Saturday evening it was PACKED. Packed enough that we weren't able to get seating, and we just decided to take this home and eat it along the way. Clearly popular. You will get cravings for Snoh, just so you know. Yes, yes you will. My girlfriend who lives in the bay area came to visit, and she regularly gets cravings of Snoh.  So go check it out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get snow in the Phoenix area.  The overall quality is comparable (but not as good) as snow places in Cali.  The selection of snow flavors and toppings is decent, and the texture of the snow is good.  The atmosphere is nice, they always have Netflix playing on the TVs and really awesome artwork (for sale) on the walls.  My only complaint is that on a few occasions, the service has been sub-par.  Mainly, the cashier who took my order was unfriendly and rude.  Still, if you're craving snow-- this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amazing flavors, great service. Went out of my way to come again before heading back to CA"}
{"text":"Snoh!!!! Is the best drink spot in town. Conveniently located and always has fast, friendly service. The strawberry slush is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints! If you've never had SNOH, you HAVE TO! Is it ice cream? Is it a snow cone? Is it shaved ice? Yes to all of the above... it's a little bit of each , in a wonderfully different way, and a party in your mouth.  What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Very cool place,  great atmosphere.  The drinks are great and the service was really good as well,  they don't skimp on the Boba which was a huge plus.  They had a few party games like Jenga and Simon says which made this place above the rest. My only complaint it that our table needed to be wiped down."}
{"text":"So many things to love about Snoh. First off, I really enjoy the modern decorations and paintings. The interior feels so different from everything else in Arizona - hipster and modern. There are even board games and cards to entertain yourself with. Along the lines of modernity, Snoh seems to always be experimenting with new creations and recipes. The first time I came they only had milk tea and shaved ice. 3 months later they had brick toast and now they have another new dessert. Innovation and a growing menu are always a plus for my taste palate.   Five stars for the milk tea! In my opinion - best milk tea in Arizona! It has enough sweetness without tasting like syrup! The portions are also great for the price. They even have a stamp card for all milk tea addicts out there.  I always drop by Snoh if I'm in Phoenix and it has happily satisfied my cravings everytime!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and I'm definitely coming back...it was DELICIOUS!!!... and their employees Lorenia, Hector and Chris are very friendly and make you feel welcome...kuddos to you guys for the excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have been impressed each time. The number of ice flavors and toppings seems to keep expanding."}
{"text":"Very good!  I go to the vape shop next door alot and always wanted to come in here. I was not disappointed at all, the ice-cream is super yummy and the place is clean and up beat!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  Love it. Great Customer Service, friendly Staff. Snoh is the best stuff in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best ice treat in phoenix area I got the tora shaved ice and it was amazing I recommend  It highly"}
{"text":"Such a great dessert spot! I highly recommend the breakfast bowl it's bomb.com. My wife and I love coming here with the kids. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great central location. Cool vibe and decor. Always a great time here. Fast service and quality ingredients. Staff is professional and helpful. Great way to beat the AZ heat."}
{"text":"Snoh is my absolute favorite place to go for dessert. It's a little out of the way from where  I live, but I will always happily make the trip  for a Taiwanese ice fix. Now that I think about it, it's kind of an addiction. Snoh is a nice combination between shaved ice and ice cream. It's not too heavy on the stomach so it doesn't leave you feeling sick if you eat so much.    I always get Taro snoh with almond pudding(lots of it) and maybe lychee jelly. No glaze for me! I personally think the glaze takes away from the lovely light flavor of the dessert. My second favorite snoh flavor is honey dew it has a lot of flavor. What is also nice about this place is even though it is a small establishment and it can get quite busy at times is the staff is always very friendly.   All in all, great service, great desserts with great flavor. I absolutely can't wait for Phoenix to warm up so I can have my snoh and not shiver while I savor every bite."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time a few months ago. Very disappointed to say the least. My wife and kids didn't like it either. To add insult to injury, my snoh had a hair in it. When my wife took it back to the counter the employee told her \"oh sorry\"."}
{"text":"Excellent staff! Came in upon closing and they were happy to help us still!! The shaved ice is the best all around"}
{"text":"Finally good boba in Phx!"}
{"text":"the people there are really friendly. one of the employees there remember me from like a month ago since my last visit and that to be means customers are more important"}
{"text":"I adore this dessert eatery!  The desserts are delicious - so far I have tried the taro snoh and the honeydew snoh and they are both amazing. The shaved ice is fluffy and flavoursome and the servings are really generous and reasonably priced.  The shop is clean and modern, with cute and trendy wall art. They play great music, but it is not too loud. I'd recommend this place for young people going out on a date, because you can chat because it's not too loud, it's reasonably priced and since the snoh ice is so big, you can share!"}
{"text":"DAMN.... this is good stuff. Found this place on Yelp after a tasty Thai dinner. The place is decorated super cool with Asian inspired art and anime drawings. I had the #11 breakfast bowl snoh,..... dudes...it's got fruity pebbles in it....BAM. I dig the vibe in this shop and I wish them much success. I wish we had one of these in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique dessert that will satisfy your sweet tooth without the overstuffed, heavy feeling after! Great flavors, toppings, sauces, and always excellent customer service. They also offer boba tea which is fantastic with almond milk. Snoh has become one of my favorite local spots!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It brings back memories of visiting California every summer and now I can get delicious shaved ice here in my hometown. And the owner is an ice cold dude. Get it? Because he's cooler than cool. Haha"}
{"text":"I can no longer endorse this place based on the cocky rude attitude of the owner. I was an early fan and introduced many friends to this place and went often. Now I am the biggest non-fan!  I noticed the owner's attitude changed after his business became successful. He went from friendly and welcoming to being outright rude!   A few examples: 1) My friend found Saran Wrap in her shaved ice and brought it to the owner's attention. She said he dismissed her and said \"it happens.\" She stopped going there after that, but I continued to go, thinking it was an isolated incident (like an idiot!). 2) I noticed that the owner's attitude started being more cocky and less friendly but I kept going (like an idiot!), until the last incident. I ordered condensed milk and double almond pudding as my topping. I noticed that I didn't get any condensed milk and very little almond pudding, so I asked the owner of e added the milk and if the pudding was doubled. He admitted to forgetting the milk and with an attitude squirted so much milk into my dessert the shaved ice melted and there was over an inch of milk left in my cup when I ate what was left of the unmelted shaved ice and pudding. On several prior visits, they forgot to double the almond pudding, so I asked if I got double and he said with an attitude with his back to me... \"If you want more let me know,\" and before I could respond and while he still had his back to me, he slopped on an excessive amount of pudding. My dessert was destroyed. I will never go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place while visiting Arizona for the time. Love it! The prices are really reasonable for a cute little dessert place! We got taro along with condensed milk and strawberries and mango on the side."}
{"text":"So soft, so tasty, almost better than Waiola in Honolulu, but Matsumoto's is still No.1!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and im going to miss it when im no longer living in town. I've never had any dessert like Snoh, likely because there really aren't a lot of places like it in Phoenix (if there are, let me know! I would love to compare!). The atmosphere is very hipster-trendy, and it can sometimes get distracting to see all the artwork on the walls and various shows on the two lcd screens. Whenever the couch is open, I make a beeline for it.  With the recent addition of combos, you no longer have to worry about what flavors will taste best with each other. Even still, I know what i like and will either stick to Gotcha Matcha (or some variant thereof) and Thai Chew. Ive also discovered another favorite, which consists of Milk cream snoh, oreo cookie topppings and condensed milk glaze. It's delicious. I can't recommend mochi balls enough. One day i will have to try the fruit mixes, when im not jonesing for my regular Snoh fix.  The teas are also delicious (haven't had a smoothie yet so i cant say anything!) and boba goes well with just about anything. If you're looking for a traditional classic, thai tea or vietnamese coffee pairs well with boba. Personally im a fan of the Green Apple and Honeydew teas.  It's funny, actually. The first time i came here, the boba was tasteless and I wondered what all the fuss was about with bubble tea and why everyone loved it so much. I'm glad I gave this place a second chance, because otherwise I never would have found my favorite dessert joint."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhhh, yes. Finally a little piece of California. The vibe here is very much like the shaved ice shops in SoCal and the owners are from there so it warmed my heart tremendously.   I ordered a small Green Tea shaved ice with Almond Cookies and condensed milk drizzle. Our in-laws ordered a small Original with strawberries and condensed milk drizzle and a small Taro with Oreos and condensed milk drizzle.   All were very good, especially the Taro, but even though it couldn't quite compare to SoCal, I'm just so happy to be able to hit this spot up whenever I yearn for a piece of home. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The offerings here are good and most of the staff are cool but there's one dude who is just too cool for school and has messed up my order the last 2 visits and he is a little rude so it kind of sours the whole experience. Other than that this place is all right."}
{"text":"Love their tea's unique place. Server was a little disappointing he made me feel uncomfortable about wanting extra Nutella. Hey it's my sweet treat for a reason I like sugar today!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place ever!! Trying to get all our friends hooked! Tony and his staff are so friendly!! If you're going to share with your friends, best thing to do is to share a large snoh (you won't regret it)!! We got it to go once and it has a 20minute span so make sure to keep your car cold and your not going too far! They do an awesome job here! Will be coming back here a lot more knowing it's here!"}
{"text":"Really missing California right now and Snoh is helping me get my Blockheads fix in Arizona. Got the taro and green tea shaved ice with mochi, red bean, and condensed milk. Pretty good, not overly sweet, however there was a bit too much condensed milk for my liking. It made the ice hard to pick up cause of the sticky goo."}
{"text":"Fun! Great food! Helpful service. The portion sizes are enormous. Can't wait to return and try several more combinations of snoh and toppings. The drinks look amaxing as well, though I did not order one on my first trip."}
{"text":"Clean Tea shop with shaved milk ice, and lots of cool art/decor.  After having a huge dinner we decided to share a large Snoh combo.  Taro and coconut shave milk, with mango, mochi, coconut jelly, topped with black sesame/condensed milk.  For the price it's pretty good considering we were able to share it with 6 people!  The dessert is very light, not to sweet, and the toppings complimented out milk flavors nicely.  If I had more room, would have tried the teas too.    Check out the deco while you wait, the turn around was only about 5 minutes, luckily we were the first in line.  Great place to snack on any hot, or cold day - if that exist in PHX."}
{"text":"WOWZA!! Try this place ASAP! Too good to pass up, especially on those hot summer days. I love the Thai Chew, all the different ingredients taste amazing together! If i'm ever on that side I always make a stop for snoh, Thai tea or the iced coffee. I will definitely be back again...and again :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! Shaved ice, crumbled Oreos, and caramel sauce? Heck yes!   We came out for the Whistl, iPhone app party, and enjoyed trying shaved ice for the first time! I will say, though, that I thought the toppings were lacking. I could have used a few more chunks of Oreos ;)"}
{"text":"still my favorite shaved ice place because it's just so different then anyone else and I love bobs as it is now I can get shave bobs and add differs fruit and glaze to it I like all of the flavors so far normally I go to Blossom next door to get my noodles and then for dessert I got here best combo ever if it's your first time get one of the pre set sno on the board you won't go wrong"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Snoh! Their Thai tea, Vietnamese iced coffee, and taro milk tea cannot be beat. Their boba is some of the best I've ever tasted. I highly recommend ordering the Purple Fusion shaved ice concoction as well...taro, pudding, cookies, oh my! The employees always have wonderful customer service both at this location and at their downtown location. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Don't miss out! The shaved ice was very light and fluffy. It tasted like heaven! Haha I usually get the Thai tea shaved ice with boba and condensed milk for the toppings.  Get there early because the downfall is that the place is small. On busy days you won't be able to find a place to sit.  *Update* So I tired their new brick toasts and it was pretty average. The presentation of both toasts were appealing; however, I personally found the toast to be slightly dry. I had better brick toasts at other places, but overall, it was decent. I prefer the coconut and strawberry toast over the almonds and bananas."}
{"text":"I've been here at least three times and it has always been good.  I stick with the milk flavor.  The mochi, almond cookie, and new custard pudding (flan without the caramel) toppings are all fantastic.  The condensed milk, butterscotch, and caramel glazes are all great too.  If they forget to add something just tell them and they'll quickly add it for you to make it right right.  I appreciate that they are actually trying with their interior, which many local small businesses could learn from.  They should consider wiping down their trash cans and sprucing up the game shelf more often though.  Overall, they offer a unique, quality product in a convenient location.  The lightness of the \"snoh\" somewhat reminds me of true Hawaiian shaved ice.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"When I say their shave ice is nothing like you've EVER had before. It's like shave ice and ice cream had a baby!!!!! I normally get their milk n cream flavored snoh layered with sweetened condensed milk topped with custard pudding. It's AMAZING!!!! I will say my only complaint is they used to offer green tea mochi and just recently stopped serving it. Now I'm a huge mochi lover and the green tea mochi was AMAZING!!!!!! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!!! Atmosphere is great perfect chill spot."}
{"text":"Shaved ice. Shouldn't be too hard - but this place just misses. It is indeed like snow - feathery snow. I like my shaved ice a bit more icy and crunchy - this was too soft and dry. Flavor - coconut was meh. Wasn't impressed. Lots of people - service was slow."}
{"text":"Who knew that you could get really good Asian style shaved ice in Phoenix. It's not like the thick and creamy Taiwanese shaved ice I'm used to from Cupertino, so I would say it seems to be more of a mix between Korean and Taiwanese style shaved ice. Regardless, it was really really really good. Good portions and prices (a regular is hugeeeeeeee and in SF, CA, it would probably cost ~$10+). I loved my milk cream with strawberries and condensed milk! Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!! Such a fun place.  Unique dessert concept!  I wish they would open one up in Scottsdale:)"}
{"text":"Every time I'm on that side of town, I ALWAYS go to snoh! Staff is friendly and it's a really nice place to hang out. I usually see a lot of families in there. Also the desserts are flippin awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped by after dinner last weekend at the noodle cafe next door. None of us were really sure what it was and we still weren't after we had it but ate it all.  Large servings so four of us shared two smalls. These are not your usual shaved ices since they have dairy in them. A couple of dairy free options available are made with dairy free creamer?  Lots of toppings and interesting ones to choose from."}
{"text":"The Thai tea snoh is delicious, as usual, by I wonder if these guys are going under...?  The bathroom has been out of order the last three times we have been (which isn't that frequently), and they were out of several common flavors and toppings today. It was also quite warm in the shop--ironic in a place called Snoh! Edited:  Appreciate the reply, Tony!  Glad to hear that you aren't going anywhere and that we just caught you on a bad day!  Our last visit was lovely--restrooms in order, nice and cool in the shop, plenty of mochi...  ;-)  You lose a star for not getting the green tea mochi back, but we love you guys!"}
{"text":"Snow is delicious! They have many great flavors and toppings. My favorite is honey dew with condensed milk, boba and Oreos !"}
{"text":"After a friend of mine went there that morning and said it was good, I had to go try it for myself.  All four of us had different flavors and toppings, we were all very impress with it.  The place is hip and the servers very friendly.  I'm ready to go back for more, wish they were closer to where I live.   Def will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Almond slushy with boba custard and caramel glaze! The best!           Love it! Everyone is nice and have patience with all my questions"}
{"text":"One of the better boba shops in town! Great flavors, and variety, of drinks paired with well-cooked boba. For those wondering, boba is a type of tapioca (a starch) and adding boba to a drink was made popular in Taiwan. Have ordered the Thai tea here and will have to return to explore the menu some more. I do find that their prices are a smidge high, though the size of the drink is pretty large and the quality and taste of their product makes it feel worth it."}
{"text":"LOVED the atmosphere. Strawberry Snoh was great. Mochi topping was delicious! Would go again."}
{"text":"I love snoh cause there's not a lot of places out here like it. My favorite is milk snoh with mochi balls strawberries and condensed milk. Gotcha matcha is really good as well. I still have a lot of stuff I haven't tried yet that I need to but overall everything I've had so far has been super good."}
{"text":"I don't know what they do to that ice but it is yummy. wish the people had a little more time to explain to you what stuff was it's a little confusing and it can be intimidating to try and order so some kind of helpful hints would be nice and seriously please don't be so condescending when I'm trying to place an order I'm mostly confused when I'm looking at your menu. So two reasons I'm only giving 3 stars is the confusing menu and the parking is terrible sometimes. but what I have ordered I really enjoyed and will continue trying to figure it out."}
{"text":"Super excited to finally try this place. I have been to Asia and had the shaved ice there. This is different but in a totally delicious way. Coming inside you are surrounded by video game and comic book art. They even have a snoh mascot sticker.  The choices can be overwhelming for a first timer. They serve snoh, slushies, and tea with several choices for both. You can create your own snoh or choose one of their combos for a small, medium or large size. I think getting a combo is more bang for your buck. I got the secret stash which is pistachio with almonds, custard and caramel. I loved it!!! My sister got the Thai chew which had boba, Mochi and black sesame sauce. It tasted just like a Thai tea drink. When the snoh melts it almost becomes more creamy than fluffy. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Since this place is pretty far from where I live, I usually end up craving one of two flavors every time I visit. I usually bring a friend with me and the workers here are patient and helpful whenever either my friends or I have a question. Its also nice that they're friendly and smile back when you smile.  The vibe in this place is pretty cool and the collected art on the walls is a unique touch. It makes me want to bring some of my own art for them to have there :)  Anyway, I usually like to get taro snow with strawberries and condensed milk. My friends and I have yet to be disappointed by anything we've gotten at this location. The only downside is the parking for this little area. If you're going to come here during busy times, be prepared to make a few circles in order to find a parking spot. Otherwise though, its always been a nice experience visiting Snoh!"}
{"text":"A must try if you're in the area! The flavors are rich.  Unlike other places where it might taste watered down.  Good little space for hanging out with friends as well!"}
{"text":"The best shaved ice ever.  It has the consistency of snow.  Very popular in the Asian community.  The toppings sound gross, but are awesome.  Have to get the condensed milk. Condensed milk on ice sounds gross, but it is so good."}
{"text":"well this is a first for me to actually give my review of all things...Shaved ICE.  this is no normal shaved ice.. Im not sure the trade secret but I do believe that the flavors are incorporated into the actual ice when frozen..  Like the other Review stated...NO sticky stuff but do get lots of napkins.....no nasty sticky residue on your cup ha...I love it.. and you a choice of toppings...  I usually get Taro with Almonds, almond pudding and condensed milk and its awesome...unlike any shaved ice Ive had in the past... Oh yes its an indoor eating place not outside like all the other temp places Ive seen popping up.  they have tvs and will accommodate your show if possible.  and they have free wifi with a few electrical outlets to use as well.  want to bring the kids...great they have little books and they have little games including Jenga, dominos etc..    want some lively art off the wall? yup they will oblige and sell you a print LOL    I really is an awesome place.  you may want to check em out when you are ion the area.  I was impressed but that is my judgment...you be the judge  its clean including the restroom...its got some great friendly people Ive met at the counter.  small little strip center with  pretty decent noodl;e shop next.  So next time your at oreganos on camelback....pass on the pizza cookie and go next door to the SNOH Ice shavery..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The menu has a great variety of ice creams (snoh), milk teas, iced teas, etc. And the best part is you can customize your order exactly how you like it. There is a great variety in toppings and flavors for all their products I had the almond milk tea and custard pudding which was delicious! The milk tea itself wasn't too sweet and I felt the custard added the needed sweetest for the perfect balance. The almond pudding is great too! If you ask, they will usually let you sample before you make a selection. I loved that the prices are reasonable for the size beverage you get. The snoh is unique, it's neither ice cream nor shaved ice...it's almost like shaved milk. Has a great consistency and lots of flavors to choose from.   Pros: good pricing great selection awesome product friendly staff  cons:  its far from my house, wish there was a joint in Ahwatukee Hoping for a better point system than the one on FiveStars"}
{"text":"I have to say OMG DELICIOUS!  I am love frozen yogurt, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this kind of ice cream.  It is light, flavorful and delicious. I shared my ice cream with my date and I wish I would have gotten my own! I had the taro flavor with condensed milk.  That topping is a must!  When I'm in the area, I will be back here."}
{"text":"After gorging myself out and going H.A.M. on a huge bowl of noodles and bread sticks in front of my date (our second date) at Cherry Blossom next door, we decided to venture over to Snoh. The shaved ice at Snoh reminded me the time when I was an obese kid eating shaved ice in the slums of Taiwan. The shaved ice texture was very unique and fluffy from what you'd imagine. They had all the sweet and fruity toppings you could want. The atmosphere was very is very fun, hip, and clean. Apparently the owner knew we both were on a date so he played some romantic music. Thanks!   Song request for next time: Careless Whisper by George Michael."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I ordered the Taro with condensed milk and fresh strawberries. It was too die for. Definitely want to come back to try everything at least once on their menu. The decoration inside was nice. Lots of artwork, big screen TV's featuring some sort of Asian movie, local business cards. I met the owner as he was taking orders & he was kind and friendly. The atmosphere is more hipsterish than I what I like, but the shaved ice here is so delicious that it definitely doesn't even matter. Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Not really my cup of tea, but the overall experience was good. You get what you pay for, and its not nasty crap. More variety and options would be nice."}
{"text":"Never have had anything like it.  Unique and  best ever.  The shaved ice is very light very similar to fresh snow powder so don't feel overly guilty when indulging for dessert.  The milk teas are awesome as well!  I love it and am addicted."}
{"text":"Love seeing the art in this place and the atmosphere is pretty chill.  Even though they are mainly knowed for their shave ice, I usually go get boba here mainly for their house special.  Their house special drink is a unique blend they mixed up, it's a mix of milk tea with some other tea flavor which makes it sweet but not too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  Very excited to find a cool place like this for families and that its dairy free friendly.  The customer service was awesome.  Definitely coming back.  We had fun with the games here while we enjoyed our Snoh."}
{"text":"Got a simple strawberry slushie. You could tell there was actual strawberry in it. The wait time was not bad at all either. It was a perfect way to cool off from the crazy Arizona heat. Definitely planning on going back to try the signature sno."}
{"text":"Cute little place that reminded me a lot of a Boba house. The second you walk in you can smell the honey and pearls. The shave ice is pretty on par with a lot of the shaveries in California. Light, chewy, cold, flavorful...some words to describe the eating experience. The workers were helpful and friendly. I didn't know what to order so the guy helping me recommended some toppings for the taro and black sesame ice I ordered. I ended up getting crushed almond cookies with a condensed milk drizzle.   I wish they would have had more ice flavors to choose from but am happy they shaved the ice the way it's supposed to be done. Parking is free and easy and the service is fast. I'd say this is a cool place to chill on a hot day...which apparently is every day in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with Snoh, but somehow the word AMAZING comes to mind.  The décor is modern with unique artwork, the staff is friendly and how do I explain their creations? Unique, Out of this World, Crazy, Fun, Irresistible, Addicting!  Guess the best way to describe Snoh is - A Must Try for yourself to know what I'm talking about.  Tip: TRY EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! I frequently drive all the way from old town Scottsdale just to come here!! I'm totally addictied to their boba tea and I've only tried the snow once but it was super good. My only complaint is that the texture of the boba is never the same. The first time I came here it was super hard and tonight it was super mushy, but other times it's perfect which keeps me coming back for more lol. Other than that this place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great place too chill with Boba tea, or be quick and run back to the car. Awesome service and even better snow and tea!"}
{"text":"Went here recently. It's very yummy. A short story, a couple of years ago we saw a Food network special about this kind of \"shaved ice\" and was craving it. Eventually we got some in LA and it was everything we wanted.  Jump back to a couple of days ago, my sister said we have to go there. Get the Thai Tea, shaved ice. That flavor is really good. I then tried the milk Thai Tea with lychee jelly. It was surprisingly good.  This store is a little small, so if there are a lot of people in there it gets really packed.     It is $6.75 for a large, perfect to share. Try this, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Neat place and the shaved ice is good. Different than anything I've had before but it is good. I've had several flavors and the best so far has been Thai Tea shaved ice, Almond Cookie topping, and Condensed Milk glaze.  Took my wife and daughter and everyone really liked it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here's a tip for the staff behind the counter who wait on customers: please be patient with those who have no idea what to order. Don't give a heavy sigh, look irritated or give customers a feeling that you're bothering them...umm...how about offering suggestions to customers on what is popular? Or helping them out in figuring out what they would like? The Owner of this place should focus training their staff on providing customer service with a smile. The 4 stars is for the cute seating area, music selection and for the yummy snoh flavors, toppings and glaze options! Service is more like 1-2 stars."}
{"text":"Can't ever get enough! I have come here so many times. The atmosphere is hip and I love the art on the walls. Will I come back? Yes! I always order the taro with boba and condensed milk. I find it so hard to try other flavors! The brick toast is also really good. Super decadent and perfectly sweet. I'm so glad this place exists!"}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of the place. Walking in you're greeted by the crazy artwork hanging on the wall, burning candles and setting just felt a very chill atmosphere. I got a Thai Tea with boba and custard, and my friend got Almond Milk Tea with boba, and we thought it was good because it wasn't too sweet and everything tasted fine. Pricing was a little much, but besides that everything was great."}
{"text":"Snoh is delicious and they have great boba! Only thing I don't like is location, but dessert and service is awesome! If you like Thai tea then you have to try it as snoh."}
{"text":"This place has pretty interesting treats. I got the pistachio flavored ice and it was delicious. It's almost like eating flavored snow and there is no other way to describe this. Also they offer dairy free options and that's always a plus for me when it comes to desserts. This place has a really cool vibe to it as well. The place is super clean, has friendly service and easy parking access."}
{"text":"I've looked at Snoh Ice Shavery multiple times on Yelp and each time, the pictures had confused me. Thai tea snoh? Taro? Mochi balls? I could go on and on about the things I don't know about. We were in the area for dinner at another restaurant that I couldn't pass up the opportunity to go here.  When we first walked in, I really liked the vibe of this place. It was somewhat busy but still a table or two open and people were just hanging out, enjoying their desserts; it felt like the perfect place to go on a date night or with a friend. After looking over the menu, I decided on the small Thai tea snoh with almond pudding and condensed milk. My date got the mango snoh with strawberries and condensed milk. It didn't take very long for us to get our desserts and after the first bite of the Thai tea snoh, I was satisfied. There were so many ways to describe it, but mostly it was light and fluffy, not as sweet as I expected it to be like Thai tea drinks usually are.  I was a little bit disappointed with my choice of almond pudding. It was a bit too mushy to go along with the texture of the snoh. I'd probably get almond slices or something crunchy in the future. My date wasn't too big of a fan of his choice. I gave it a try and felt that it was too artificial tasting and was lacking something. I'd say that if I was in the area, I'd think about stopping by but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The drink was very good. decoration of the front is very cute. However, customer survive is not quite good, I don't know what his name and he is not friendly AT ALL!!!!"}
{"text":"Best boba and shaved snow spot in phoenix! They have two non dairy snow flavors, and some daily specials, too. My friend convinced me to get their 32oz Mason jar for $3 fill ups on Mondays. Such a good deal for a boba-holic, and I've been filling it with water on my off days for a hydration win. Parking can be so bad here so just a heads up! Sign up for their rewards thingy for a free topping!"}
{"text":"Yea had this for the first time last weekend it's just AWESOME...had the Mango with Kiwi, Almond Cookies and Condensed Milk . Staff was super nice and offered help with my choices. Just go and beat the heat with this cool goodness!"}
{"text":"Ummmm this is the best stuff I have ever tried. I get the taro snoh with almond pudding and condensed milk. Just for the record, I'm russian and had no idea what taro and almond pudding were until I randomly tried it here. The combination is heavenly. Oh, and get the stamp card because you will be back for more, trust me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dessert spots, I love having taro snoh with black sesame glaze, boba & custurd pudding. Perfect treat during the summer heat!"}
{"text":"This place is trendy as !@#$. The decor and art on the walls make me think of Roosevelt and 5th only safer, this isn't far from the Biltmore after all. Snow is the perfect summer treat.  Here you pick your flavor snow, add toppings, and sauce.  I go for green tea snow, mochi, and condensed milk.  My friend got the taro and was very pleased.  They also have boba smoothies and it looks like they're getting into the habit of switching out seasonal flavors."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try this place last night..I  finally found a parking spot go inside and wow  the line ..I only had 15 minutes and it wasn't moving. Had to leave so think king of trying it again but not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place has amazing teas!  Get their mason jar to get a better deal and more tea!   I like the shave ice.... but I can't seem to find my favorite/perfect combination.  This place is super busy, especially on weekends and after work.  Plan to wait in line and get cozy with some strangers while you wait for them to call your name."}
{"text":"Accurately charged for my snoh orders this time around from the guy at the cash register. Friendly. Enjoyed a cool  treat for the summer time heat! Will be back again."}
{"text":"So happy that the frozen yogurt craze is dying down.  Snoh is a nice addition to the AZ frozen dairy/dessert scene. It was just before noon in August and blistering hot. My friend and I as well as two large parties awkwardly peered through their windows to find ready but bored teenage employees unapologetically staring at us as we sweated in the sun. It would have been a nice gesture to open  30 seconds earlier than official opening time knowing that 10 people (including two very elderly people) were waiting outside.   The green tea snoh was a light, fluffy, and tiny bit grainy. Unique and enjoyable. My friend's snoh was also tasty and a bit more sweet than mine.  Service could have been a lot better. Would it kill those kids to throw on a fake smile every once in a while? They look so sad."}
{"text":"This place is great! Although they don't always have boba, the desserts are delicious! It's a cross between ice cream and shaved ice and the flavors are out of this world! I would recommend to anyone and will go back again!"}
{"text":"We love this place and are already planning our next treat choices. Great atmosphere! We played Jenga with our kiddos and just relaxed."}
{"text":"If you like tasty cold treats, you must check out Snoh!  I don't say \"ice cream\" or \"shaved ice\" because it really isn't either of those things like I think of it. And if a few friends hadn't raved about the place I doubt I would have checked it out. Shaved ice didn't sound that exciting. Don't make that mistake - this place is great!  I had the shaved thai tea, almond cookie topping, and black sesame glaze. I had no idea what I was ordering, so asked the super friendly guy at the counter (Tony) for advice. It was nice, light, and super tasty. My wife had the taro, shaved almonds, and caramel glaze. Hers was more savory than mine, but both were delicious.  The place also has a great vibe. Super clean, with some slick art on the walls. A TV was playing a dubbed asian war movie of some kind that was fun to watch. They also have games on one of the tables up front to keep kids (and adults) entertained.  If it sounds interesting but you're not sure what some of these flavors are like (taro?), don't let that stop you. The staff was great and can help you put together something nice and safe or crazy and adventurous. Either way it is seriously refreshing on a hot Phoenix day.  This is one of our new favorite dessert places in town. Get in there and try it out!"}
{"text":"I love their strawberry lychee iced tea with boba and lychee jelly! So good! Me and my friend has been coming here every Thursday for thirsty Thursdays... buy one get one half off! I am so happy we found a place in Phoenix that has good boba... there is not many places that are good, but this is one of them!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is great.  I ordered the green tea ice with mochi and sweet sesame.  I love it.  One of my girls ordered regular with oreos and caramel...yummy.  The added bonus is the local artwork you can buy.  My family and I will get every chance to visit again."}
{"text":"Best dessert shop in the Phoenix area by far. Something unique and delicious. I always refer anyone from in town and out to try this place out!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best boba place in all of Central Phoenix that I am personally aware of. They occasionally do Groupon specials so you can nab some discounted drinks through that app on your phone.  Flavors are plentiful, go to their website, the menu is extensive!  One thing I want to caution though, if you're not a fan of excess amounts of sugar, Snoh Ice Shavery DOES offer a \"half sweet\" option for most of their milk tea drinks with the exception of their \"house blend\" (house blend is just tea, that's why there's no option to make half sweet because it's not sweet to begin with). Anyway, some of us like the half sweet option so our insulin levels don't get all wonky in our bodies.  Check Google before you go to see how busy they are in the current hour, because when this place gets packed, it is PACKED.  Finally, the art factor: The art is dope as fuck. Check out some of my photos that I've added of this place, there is some crazy cool art on the walls here. Long time ago, people could draw on the wall themselves, but the business decided to remove that aspect, probably because of the maintenance costs that were associated with it.  Come to Snoh Ice Shavery sometime! It's a great hiding spot especially during hot Phoenix summers."}
{"text":"Super tasty!!  I'm so excited that another asian place opened up in Phoenix--usually you'd see something like this in Chandler...but I'm so stoked that it's in my hood!  I tried the taro with almond pudding and sesame topping.  Mmmmm...delicious!  It's hot in Arizona, go get some SNOH!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! First tasted it at the Matsuri festival and was blown away. I haven't strayed to much from from my original selection although I swear every time I go I will try something new the taro flavor always gets to me. I love the taro with condensed milk and mochi."}
{"text":"We try to scrounge up shaved ice places all across the nation because we love shaved ice especially the old Taiwanese style kind that's so hard to find these days unless you are in Houston because more fusiony modern ice is popping up everywhere. We usually don't perfer this kind and have tried it in our hometown and elsewhere BUT so glad we found this particular place. Read the reviews, was near where we had dinner and gave it a shot. I was so excited to bring my fam here because it's not easy to find a good shaved ice eatery especially with funky flavors like sesame and taro.  That's what we got. Yes it seems a bit much at $8 but you get to pick two flavors of ice and two toppings. Of course I got mochi n boba. Yes I did wish they gave us more mochis n bobas but the large sized  dessert was decently sized (idk if it's the same to-go), totally shareable with the kids although I would have enjoyed it more just with my husband n I :) Kids didn't like the sesame yes it's an acquired Asian taste but they devoured the taro and condensed milk n my toppings :/ we need Snoh in Austin!   My daughter got pistachio milk tea and man was it yummy! Non dairy too :)   Cute lil place with games to play, picture wall with props and clean bathrooms. Nice guys working there who told us to come back up to get more condensed milk topping halfway through. Who does that?  Definitely will go back if we are in town n wish we have one back home :( would go here daily vs Monster Ice here :/   Definitely would recommend a try and not to expect it to be like the typical shaved ice or snocone you get. Its different not meant to be pebbly but funkier, grittier, n silkier. Fun ;)"}
{"text":"I was never much into shaved ice, but this place...let's just say I am addicted. I can't get enough.   The ambiance is great with a hip decore and nice art.  It has great location. The service is super good and fast.   I mostly order mango flavor with nutella. They have great selection of topings to choose from. Many different combos and trust me, you can not go wrong.   I am looking forward to my next visit...."}
{"text":"Snoh is amazing. The Thai ice tea flavor is my favorite and the service is always great. Super yum! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Everything is good. Everything. So refreshing!  My wife and I moved away from Phx just as Snoh was getting big, and wow do we miss it. We recently came back from Philadelphia and drove out to Phx from the East Valley just to eat at Snoh. It is truly better than any Snoh I had in Taiwan -- they know what they're doing! We would gladly fly back just to eat Snoh again. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"I was actually very excited to try this place out. So we've been there twice now, and it's always been very busy both times. I feel like the people behind the counter are not helpful AT ALL. I've asked questions both times that I've gone and I think all the hype has gone to their heads because they come off as very rude people. I would go there more often but I really don't like the vibe in there. Umm, let's see both times we've gone they were out of things we order, and we have to settle for something else. The tables both times we've gone have been sticky and dirty. The windows to the business are also pretty grimey. The boba milk tea I ordered was good but nothing spectacular. I guess if you go I wish you luck that they have what you ask for and that they are happy to serve you."}
{"text":"My girlfriend introduced me to this place and we frequently stop by to grab a cup of their snoh. I almost always order the Purple Fusion because its so good I just never get tired of it and the Vietnamese coffee is really good too! The only complaint I have is that the tables don't seem to get wiped down enough but that isn't a huge problem because we mostly take it to go but the 3-4 times we have had the snoh there we noticed the a lot of the tables are covered in crumbs or sticky stuff."}
{"text":"This place is \"eh\" at best. If you have been to Taiwan then you will understand. The milk tea is drinkable but no where near authentic. The snow however is good. In addition, I have tried their vietnamese iced coffee. That was no good. Will not order that ever again. Trust me when I say I know the authentic taste of milk tea from Taiwan and the Vietnamese iced coffee from Vietnam. I've been to both countries. Overall, I guess it's alright. I prefer to go elsewhere but, this is still an okay place to go to. Give it a try I guess..."}
{"text":"I love Asian desserts and it's hard to find them in AZ. When I'm in Asia I look for Taiwanese and Thai desserts with ice, red bean, condensed milk, mango, tapioca pearls, etc. The owner of snoh told me his technology is from Hong Kong. This place satisfies my Asian dessert needs. My order is the same every time. I get coconut snoh with black sesame glaze topped with red bean! It is so light and the sweetness level is just right. I tell all of my friends and coworkers to visit Snoh when they're in Phoenix. I want the owner to open one in Tucson so badly!"}
{"text":"Walked over here after a delightful meal next door at the Noodle Place. B-Day Girl wanted something sweet and tasty. I have never seen a place like this before. Simple menu and some interesting ingredients. Hmmm?  I have always liked Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt or just a smidgen of that Midwest delicious Custard. This place is a bit different and at the same time a one of a kind experience. More of an Asian twist if I can say so. Nice!  Everyone ordered something different. You pick the size, flavors of the base ingredient, and then what toppings you like. Then you choose a glaze to finish it off. They also sell milk tea and ice teas.  I order a Regular sized Original with Mochi Balls, Almond Pudding covered with Black Sesame Topping. One of the family members ordered something with a Mango and Chocolate combo kinda of thingy going on. I did not ask what the B-Day Girl got but the Granddaughter liked it so much she shot a spoonful across the room onto the wall. Napkin Please.  All around COOL concept with some interesting flavor combinations. I like the game playing area as well. Just kick back and chill if time permits. Game On!  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I found this place via yelp and suggested that my out of town family members to try this place with me. If you get a large shaved ice, they can put it on the plate. It looks a lot more presentable for the insta-game. The kind young man at the cashier was kind enough to explain everything to us in great detail. We had a lot of questions too! He seem excited about his job!   We got the matcha ice with mochi and aloe jelly as our topping. The matcha ice and toppings were drizzled with condensed milk yumminess. The ice is soft, smooth, and melts in your mouth. The one of a kind ice in Phoenix is worth trying! I also got the lychee boba tea slush. The boba was better than the first time I had it at Snoh. The lychee flavor was subtle.    4 stars for the boba, 5 stars for the snow!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars. I've had better snow shaved ice before at other places, but this is the best snow shaved ice that you are going to get in Arizona. The boba was actually really good and was warm, which my friends and I liked. We got a large green tea and milk cream with strawberries and honey boba. The ice isn't flaky melt in your mouth kind, but it is smoothe. I would recommend coming here. The staff is really nice and they have tables to hang out and chat with friends at. There are TVs and they have some cool decorations on the walls."}
{"text":"I got the jar of passion fruit tea with lychee jellies here and it was so yummy! The staff was so nice. The little girl scooping the jellies into the drink was so adorable. The owner's mom even came over to talk to my friends and I. She was such a sweet lady and really made us feel welcome. I also love the interior of the place, the artwork on the walls were so cool. They just need to open one on the east coast."}
{"text":"Your super friendly neighborhood frozen treat shop. The service is great. The environment is warm and welcoming. These guys were featured on the local news for a reason!"}
{"text":"I would give this 100 stars if I could. I have had traditional asian shaved ice before and I am so glad I could find a place in phoenix. I had many people recommend it and it was true to the hype.   The space has great art and games like jenga for people to play.   We ordered taro with mango and condensed milk. The taro is one of the most popular flavors and it is clear why. It's delicious am not too sweet.   The other one we got was Thai tea with mochi and condensed milk. Also delicious, but I preferred the taro."}
{"text":"Regular matchi snow with honey boba,mochi balls, and condensed milk"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!! Every time we come to Phoenix, we will definitely be stopping here! Can't wait to go there again tomorrow! I don't think you could go wrong with any of the menu items.  awesome place! Amazing employees/service too!"}
{"text":"Best in PHX for boba tea and snow. Always coming up with new deals and menu items and I love them for that. Please don't leave us ever!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Didn't realize this use to be near where we lived previously until we were moving. Location is great, parking is so-so. Staff friendly, but definitely gipped me of my punch card. Some of the staff would only punch my card once, when I had bought maybe 4-5 drinks, when the card clearly reads items, not visits. Still have yet to try the signature \"snoh\" item, as Im writing based on my experience purchasing their boba drinks. Wish they could blend the drinks instead of just serving over ice. Overall good."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it! The atmosphere is super friendly, they have games available and are very geek welcoming! Prices are good for the amount you get and the taste is wonderful!!!!! No fav for when I am getting a sweet tooth!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit this visit (2nd time) was better than my last.  My first visit was less than exciting  which was true bummer because I traveled all the way from Goodyear (with a toddler) to enjoy this tasty treat. When I arrived I asked the gentleman could he help me because I have never been there before, let's just say he did not look happy when I told him I was using Groupon voucher (or maybe because I have septum ring, Lol).  So, this time I took time to study the online menu so I wouldn't upset anyone at the counter.  The snoh is pretty good, the Boba is decent...I will admit, I am little bit bias because I love, love different flavored boba. I have one Groupon left and I will try the bricktoast that looks absolutely scrumptious!!  I just hope my next visit the person at the counter will be as helpful as the young lady was today!"}
{"text":"We dropped by here yesterday thinking out would be a fun place to try. The place was very busy, and based on that i was ready for an awesome experience. However, that was not to happen. We ordered a lemon and a peach slushie and paid over $9 for the two. The lemon had no flavor at all! The peach was so so.  I expect a product like that when paying $2 but not $9. Im going to assume they were so busy that they were putting out sub par products. Extremely disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Loved the taro sno with almond cookies, almond pudding and condensed milk! Very cool place, would like to go back and try the brick toast next time. We were there on a Friday night and lots of folks hanging out, playing games, very nice place to relax with a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year but yesterday the 11th a Sunday the staff was less than 1 star !!!!! They were 4 of them but when we came in it took them over 5 minutes to get out front ! Then they all looked more miserable than angry cat ! Smiles are definitely not part of this crew they and oh forget the customer service , their crappy attitude matched the shaved iced they served it looked like they were out just not having it on a Sunday ! My \"snoh\" looked like dried up play doh and even tasted worst !"}
{"text":"my favorite dessert place! :) better than ice cream and froyo put together! and the staff is always really nice and friendly. definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Taro with boba. Best dessert ever! Need to go 24/7 cause I'm always craving it. Fun place to go and hang out with friends outside of the bar scene.. it's every big child's dream"}
{"text":"The snoh itself (I had taro with almond jelly and condensed milk) is pretty good but their size options are overpriced by about a dollar each. I don't think this was intentional, but I sensed some attitude when I asked if I could mix two flavors - the answer is no for small and regular size. Friend ordered taro milk tea and it was not good. The drink was poorly mixed and the boba were either undercooked or had been sitting out for too long.  Also, when an employee cleaned the table next to ours, he sprayed the table cleaner in such a way that the aerosolized droplets made their way into my open mouth.  Not a pleasant taste or feeling when you are trying to eat.   Overall: come if you've never had asian shaved ice before, but stick to yogurtland for better value and variety."}
{"text":"My Go-To Boba joint in the Valley. In San Diego you come across the bigger joints like Lollicup and Tapioca Express; Snoh in my opinion is up there!! Love the teas and the slushes. My ultimate fav is the lemon-green tea with Boba!  perfect every time. Thirsty-Thursday, two for five tea's and Thai Tea Tuesday, has us comin back for more. The crowds at the establishment are to show for the crave around the valley. Staff are always friendly and familiar faces every time. Fun to sit back and play board games and enjoy the lovely art work displayed across the walls!"}
{"text":"This place is hopping.  They were very busy with a lot of choices . Maybe too many . Service was quick we liked their mango  ice with fresh mango and Condensed milk . Best deals are large which you can share with two others  the place is noisy and not a place for conversation"}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly service and great green tea shaved ice! Would definitely recommend this cute, quirky place!"}
{"text":"Their drinks are so good. The location is great but I live all the way in west valley... This place cannot be compared to other boba in town. Hands down the best place for hangouts, drinking milk tea, ice tea, and deserts. Love their house blend special and mango ice tea!"}
{"text":"I love their shaved ice and the variety of different flavors but last time I went in, the cashier was extremely rude, not only to me but to each person that was in line after me & 2 of my friends I was with. We couldn't believe it! Not sure if the person was just having a bad day or what his deal was but no matter what the business is, a customer should not be given attitude or snarky remarks while ordering and asking about their products. As much as I love their shaved ice and flavors it's definitely not worth putting up with that attitude. My friends and I decided we won't be back since there are tons of other places with much friendlier staff :)"}
{"text":"I love the variety of the snow flavors that they have. Service is also very nice. I love the almond cookies. Such a good add on."}
{"text":"Taste good but they use powder for all their drinks. I like my tea to be freshly brewed. With all the boba shops, for them to cut costs and be lazy making their boba teas, this place just doesn't compare to other better ones nearby. Their boba texture is good tho."}
{"text":"pretty damn tasty and reasonable priced.....the boba was on point."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I had the purple fusion and it was heaven and the brick toast was better than you know what. ;-). I am totally coming back here."}
{"text":"The place is always  busy. But they are  pretty  fast. The shaved ice is light and refreshing.  . There are a lot of choices. Place is clean . Most of the customers  are younger . Portions  are large  and medium order is plenty to share . My favorite  is mango . You might not be able to find parking or a place to sit"}
{"text":"Alright, so I visited this place for the first time I went to Phoenix before returning back home to Florida.   First off, I'd like to thank them for their awesome service and accommodation. We arrived a little earlier than opening time as they were setting up & allowed us to sit inside with our puppy as we waited. (YES, they allow pets). It was awesome and made us feel very welcome from the start.  I stumbled across this place thanks to the reviews and photos other yelpers had posted. So when the gentleman at the cashier I explained to him about it being our first time and there was one particular picture that caught my eye & though I did not know what it was, all I had to show him was the picture and he explained what it was and started making it right away.   They give you the choice of size, flavored ice(s), toppings, and sauces. Since I wasn't sure what sauce would taste best (though both were described to me) he surprised me with adding both on my dish. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  It was fulfilling, delicious, flavorful, and just enough to cure a sweet tooth craving without an overwhelming taste. I just HAD to share thee picture the moment I saw it & good thing I did, because it was not pretty for long once you dive in.  As I am no longer in the Arizona region, I am already planning my trip to Phoenix again and Snoh is (and forever will be) on my list."}
{"text":"Ordered the coconut shaved ice with strawberry topping and condensed milk drizzle.  Not a fan of coconut normally but this is so light and fluffy it melts in your mouth. You also get a 15% discount for posting a Yelp review. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the milk teas here. I've had their shaved ice and it is good, but I keep coming back for the milk teas. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I spotted this next door to Cherry Blossom, and wanted to know what all of the hype was about as I've never experience \"snow\" before. My husband and I were pretty full from dinner, so we decided to split a small. We chose the green tea, with mochi, oreos, and caramel drizzle. The snow was unlike anything I've had before, well at least food-wise, because it really was almost like eating snow. It was very light and fluffy and melted as it hit your tongue. The green tea flavor was very good, I like that it was subtle. The toppings added some dimension to the dish with the chewy sweet mochi (kind of like gummy bears) and crunchy oreos. The caramel drizzle was very decadent, and a nice added touch. The girl who checked us out was very helpful and friendly, and offered to give us recommendations if needed, which was nice. I can't wait to come back and try more flavors, or I might even try the boba next time!"}
{"text":"Think cold cotton candy ....That is exactly what Snoh is like! It literally melts in  your mouth and is so refreshing. I love that it is light and airy, the perfect not-too-rich, satisfying dessert! I split a small Smorrissey (Chocolate Snoh, Marshmallows, Graham Crackers & Nutella). Seriously heaven. I can't wait to come back and try some of their other combinations! The concept is so unique and will literally send your tastebuds asking for more. (I secretly wished that I had ordered my own and didn't share). ;) This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I've ordered has been tasty, the staff is friendly and helpful, and its a nice clean place to relax. I would definitely recommend trying it out if you haven't already. You won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Shaved ice dessert.  Ordered the coco loco and the mango loco. Small size. Is plenty big for two people to share.    The coco loco has an okay coconut taste ....... But very dry   For shaved ice I was surprised at how dry it was.   The mango loco had nice fresh chunks of mango on too. The mango flavour failed to carry through to the shaved iced   I loved the caramel sauce on the top. The mango pudding at the bottom was pretty tasteless and rather gelatinous. Did not add anything to the shaved ice concoction   Would suggest trying something with stronger flavour base   Fun vibe"}
{"text":"Ignore the reviews that don't rate this place with five stars!!! Amazing staff and amazing treats. The breakfast bowl is my favorite and I can't wait to try more of their items! The whole place is great. Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Honestly not getting the hype about this place, my friend and I both walked with relatively high expectations from all the other yelp reviews but neither of us felt satisfied.  I ordered the green tea flavor snoh while he had the milk flavor and honestly I must say it just wasn't very good.  Perhaps I'm biased because I just had Blockheads in LA a month or two before but even then my unbiased friend seemed to agree with me that the snoh wasn't even mediocre.  Maybe we just came in on a bad night but I will give props to the customer service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"You do not know what you are missing if you have not been here! A must on your bucket list! Make sure to try a drink along with your snoh, i promise you will regret nothing."}
{"text":"Updated:  Business reach out and actually trying to improve customer experience add 1 star. To neutral review. I'll be willing to try this place again in the future.  ***  Tried once out of curiosity. I asked the teenager behind the counter about one of yhe drink flavor, he cant explain what the flavor taste like. All he said was it sweeter than milk tea. Got the drink come to find out it taste like extra sweet coconut. I hate coconut. I used to served boba, starbucks coffee back in HS/College year. It's part of server job to be able to understand the taste of the beverage you are serving. Even if you dont want to taste the food/drink you should be able to provide some description of the drink more than it is sweet especially when the name of the drink is ambiguous. It's boba drink dude, it's laced with tons of sugar, of course it will be sweet. (-2)  Small place, typical okay deco, nothing spectacular plus the experience I described above...i just dont view this place as 5 star place hence i used 4 star max for review."}
{"text":"I love Snoh! I stumbled upon this place looking for dessert places in Phoenix while on a trip and boy did it not disappoint. As soon as I walked in I love the atmosphere, there is a lot of art all over the walls. Also if you go with a group of people there are board games that you can play while you enjoy your Snoh and/or Milk Tea.  One thing I realized about the menu was all the toppings you are able to put on your Snoh. There are so many choices and flavors and you can even decide what glaze you want. I decided to go with the large size so I can have two flavors, I went with green tea and black sesame with condensed milk as the glaze. For the toppings I have almond cookies, mochi and strawberries. I loved the green tea but I loved the black sesame Snoh even more and it definitely compliments the green tea. The green tea Snoh was sweet while the black sesame had a nutty taste to it. The condensed milk as a glaze pretty much compliments any Snoh and since I was torn between the black sesame and condensed milk, the girl working was nice enough to give me a little sample to try.  They also have brick toast that I didn't get to try but looks super yummy, hopefully I'll be in town soon again so I can. I really wish I had a Snoh Ice place like this closer to me. However if I do go back to Phoenix, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Hmm,  this is definitely not for me.  This dessert is a little bland for an americanized taste.  I guess I have lived here too long and I crave a lot more sweetness.  I agree with Evan, the price and wait is a little much, not worth my time or money.  The desserts look really pretty and that is why I bumped it up a notch, but I will not be coming back.  After eating the top part that had condensed milk and the strawberries, I pretty much left the rest.  I am sure they are not going to miss me anyways."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! I always have shave ice when I'm in China, and it's great to see it finally land here in the Valley.   For those who don't know, many countries and cultures in Asia and across the world have shaved ice desserts. They may range from Filipino halo-halo, to Korean bingsu, and to Chinese bing-sha. Most of them involve finely shaved ice with sweetened condensed milk, fruits, beans, and other toppings.  Snoh takes it one step further by providing flavors of shaved ice! I loved their green tea and taro snoh, especially paired with toppings like mochi and red bean with a glaze of sweetened milk. Highly recommend this place.  The decor is bright and trendy with cool artists displaying their work on the walls. There are TVs on the walls and overall, it's a great place to socialize with friends and just chill."}
{"text":"I'll own up to the fact that when I first heard about this place, the first image that I conjured up was that of snow cones I grew up with during summer and particularly as a snack bar staple of my little league baseball years.  Needless to say I didn't have high expectations nor a whole lot of enthusiasm to try this place.  A friend of mine and his wife came here beforehand and were pretty blown away with what they discovered so they invited me along this time.   The place is set right next door to CherryBlossom on 9th St & Camelback and in fact I think it might be owned by the same family.  Its not a huge space and it was pretty packed here on a Saturday night.  When you walk up to the counter the menu is pretty easily discernible as they lay out the ordering process step by step.  Pick a size, pick a snoh flavor, pick one of their numerous toppings, pick a glaze.  Pretty much like you would do at any ice cream joint.  Not really having any comprehension for what was about to flow my way, I went for broke and went weird on my order.  Medium mango snoh, topped with M&Ms, cinnamon toast crunch and chocolate sauce.  Okay it sounds gross, but I was once substituted Gatorade for milk in my Fruit Loops as a kid.  So I could've done worse, okay?  Took about 5 minutes for them to prepare and cost about $6.  This stuff surprised me in a number of ways.  For starters, snoh is not your all-American snow cone ice, not even close.  Its packed with plenty of flavor and much more closely approximates ice cream.  The other surprise is that I didn't feel uncomfortably full at all after I was done.  The snoh almost seems to mask the actual portions you're being served as the melting effect is very gentle and you don't feel you've actually eaten that much.  Some might call that a scam.  I think it might be a brilliant solution to our obesity epidemic.  The toppings actually complimented the snoh quite well, though admittedly mixing mango and chocolate was probably not my best idea.  All in all, a great value for the price.  The place was pretty clean despite being busy and I walked away satisfied without being uncomfortable.  I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars as I'm still partial to the genuine all-American dense creamy scoop of ice cream.  But snoh is a cool concept that obviously has a following and I'd be more than happy to take in another trip here.  Though you probably should steer clear of the \"imaginative\" combinations I threw out of left field on my first try."}
{"text":"First off, I'm SOO happy I live walking distance from this place!! New fav lil hangout spot. For my first time, it was cute & hipster. Very clean & their sweets are pretty bomb! Strawberry snoh ice shaving with condensed milk.. YUM! plus my boyfriend and I played a quick round of Jenga while we enjoyed our treat. Very cool concept"}
{"text":"Usually we have gone to places near Asian grocery stores but stumbled upon this place via Yelp.  I'm all about the boba (tapioca pearls) so when I had my first milk tea from here, I was happy with the texture and taste of their boba. I haven't tried the shaved ice but from other people's faces, it looked like they enjoyed theirs. In terms of milk teas and boba, it's a pretty good place. Only gave 3 stars because they don't offer varieties in milk tea selection nor do they do blended drinks. The taro milk tea is also a little gritty, maybe not mixed well? But it's still good and so is their Thai tea."}
{"text":"Ordered strawberry and a Honeydew with Mochi Balls. Light, very airy and good. BUT Overpriced for what you actually get. ;("}
{"text":"I love the Taro Boba milk tea. The bobas made just right. Usually its a hit or miss.  You either get them way too mushy or tough. They have beautiful art hanging on the walls and its a cool spot to talk/chill with friends. The joint has board games you can play with while you socialize"}
{"text":"Expected the ice to have more flavor. Was very wrong. I recommend you get a ton of of icing and other flavorful toppings. Without them it doesn't taste like anything. Pretty cool little hipster place though."}
{"text":"one word: AMAZING. Pretty soon this will be replacing fro-yo places. $3.75 for a small is pretty decent. I tried 3 different flavors. Taro-Lychee and Black Sesame, Thai Tea-Green Tea Mochi and Black Sesame, Strawberry-Strawberry Mochi, Almond Cookies and Condensed Milk. The best was the Taro. Such a different flavor and flavorful. The Thai tea was good but probably goes better with sweeter flavors. And the strawberry was ok but it wasn't so creamy, it was more icy than creamy.  The place is pretty trendy. and has games to play, sofa and its right next to Cherry Blossom and Oregano's, two of my favorite restaurants. Skip dessert there and come here."}
{"text":"This is a fun experience! Shaved ice like you've never had before. So fluffy just melts in your mouth and the flavors are awesome. Must try coconut with nutella and boba and the taro milk tea with boba is awesome too"}
{"text":"Poor quality snoh. Lacking flavor. Got the smores bowl. The place looks cool but the snoh isn't great."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Snoh for months...\"You've GOT to try it!\" Well, it's just a couple of doors down from where we got ramen, so...we tried it!  Walked in - cool space - walls are packed with pop-art/comic book art - fun!  Walked to the counter to try to ascertain what we might care to order.  Pretty complicated menu - lots of choices!  First of all, Snoh isn't shave ice, and it isn't ice cream - it's a fusion of the two. Then they have flavors and toppings and etc.  We perused the menu for a while, and everyone sorted out what they wanted. I chose the \"Secret Stash\" - pistachio flavored, almond slivers, caramel and egg custard. Next, had to choose a size - S - M - L - more realistically L - XL - and \"YGBFKM!\"   Wow - huge servings!  I went with a small.  The pistachio flavored snoh was good, as were the almonds and the caramel, but...I didn't care for the egg custard - it was almost like nearly hard-boiled egg white - not my thing, but hey, try something different next time.  All in all, a fun stop - but would've been better if we hadn't just finished dinner and were more hungry.  Worth another try."}
{"text":"I love the youthful atmosphere, and plenty of table games so you can spend some time with friends and family. The staff were super friendly and professional. Other than that, The greentea snow that I ordered melted too quickly and it tasted like ice to me more than snow. The boba was well-cook and mochi was decent. Just the overall experience didn't win me over. 3 stars for you, Snoh."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten a really delicious hearty meal, but there was this lingering desire for something sweet? But at the same time you have no idea how you can fit another bit of anything in to your happy, full belly? Worry not. This is how I felt after finishing my plate next door at Cherry Blossom, we decided we had to give Snoh a shot. I thought I would just take a bite of my husbands Shaved Ice. After that one bite, I knew I had to have my own. Scraping the last bit from the bottom of my bowl, I actually was regretting not getting the biggest bowl they had to offer. It was so light, fluffy, and craving curing, but with out the whole feeling of being miserable. I LOVED IT.   You don't just have to have the shaved ice. They also have Iced Teas, Coffees, Slushies' and Vietnamese Toast. You can chose one of the options from the board that they have carefully created for you. Or you can create your own.   Don't be scared of something different for dessert. You wont regret giving Snoh a try."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to check this place out! So delicious and would definitely recommend! They have so many different options to choose from and the staff was quite friendly.  The only downsides: parking, lack of indoor seating, and 3-4 items on the menu were out :("}
{"text":"Loved it! First time trying something like this. As a newbie I went with Taro/condensed milk/almond cookie. It was delish! I honestly can't wait to try other toppings & flavors."}
{"text":"Okay. I should be doing homework but this place is so good I had to review it. I got their Pistachio Milk Tea! I'm lactose intolerant so when I saw that most of their drinks are dairy free I almost jumped for joy. Most boba places already have milk in their premade milk teas, so I was happy that this place had dairy free items. (I'm guessing they use dairy free creamer)"}
{"text":"\"If all the snowflakes were candy drops and milkshakes, Oh what a snow it would be. Standing outside with my mouth open wide, Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.\"  This child hood song comes to life with snoh. Little tiny snowflakes, Embossed with burst of exotic flavors, Melting into your taste buds magically, As your eyes enjoy a nice does of art pieces on the wall.  I love Snoh. Five Flaky Stars ;-)"}
{"text":"Snoh is the ideal retreat from the heat in Phoenix in the summer!  Thai tea is my favorite flavor, with pecans and slivered almonds. A touch of black sesame glaze tops it off. They also have an assortment of iced tea, boba and other tasty shaved ice concoctions.  If you're looking for a a refreshing dessert, stop by. The texture is lighter and more refreshing then ice cream in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"This ice!!! Is the best snoh in all the winter womderland. The owners know how to connect with the young and older crowd. With smart decor simply playful.  Roomy and cool air make this the perfect desert oasis!"}
{"text":"I got the mountain of dew and it was amazing! I love cinnamon I love Mountain Dew and that made it such a great combination! It tastes amazing and I would come back for it! It's a great place to hang out with family or friends and play board games"}
{"text":"Third time here and it was amazeballs! I tried the green tea again and I think it's a very light green tea. I just wish the taste is stronger but not bad. The pistachio was amazing!! Definitely my favorite place now!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Super chill vibe, phenomenal customer service, but most importantly, house blend milk tea with boba, TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"Good ice cream.. Good atmosphere.. Never make me disappointed!! I always come here when I have a stress out from school and work.. Their ice cream always make me happy!!  Taaa... Taaaa... Taaaaa.. I am loving it..!!!"}
{"text":"Shaved ice dessert.  A quaint joint to grab a refreshing bite.  Lots to choose from and you can have yours custom made as well."}
{"text":"Such an awesome concept!!  The shaved ice is so soft and fluffy and it comes in many different flavors which you can use to make custom snohs or the combo flavors they have on the board.  They have just about any topping you can think of and you can tell the ingredients are of good quality.  The decor is so cute too.   They also have milk teas you can make all kinds of combos with too and thai iced teas.    LOVE this place!  I will be visiting much more frequently!  Pat bing su is my favorite dessert so this is right up my alley!"}
{"text":"After pizza, we had to get dessert. This is a small shop that has lots of neat artwork on the walls. Tables fill up fast so you may or may not get seating. Staff here were great.   Green Tea Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - This did not really taste like green tea. It had a mild cinnamon flavor so it reminded me more of a horchata. The boba was a little firm and chewy. Yes, we compared the boba to Tea Station and it didn't even come close.   The Golden Touch - Found this on Instagram under their \"secret menu\" post. The workers didn't know what it was so it was kind of funny. For those of you that want to know, it was the house blended milk tea, almond pudding (I got custard pudding because they didn't have almond), ice cream, honey boba, Oreos, and caramel glaze. This was actually tasty. The Oreos were my favorite part. I would probably swap out some things to make the flavor pop a little more but I enjoyed it.   We are from San Diego so it was nice to find boba away from home."}
{"text":"A completely different kind of frozen treat!! I really like the shaved ice aspect (well this is what it reminded me of anyway) ---BUT BETTER.    Definitely somewhere I'd go again when wanting something different. Just wish the portions were slightly smaller. Definitely something to share if you're not a regular sweets or frozen treat kind of person."}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile now and I've always been so impressed with the dessert, drinks, and customer service but I recently had the best experience I've had here. Tony, the owner, was working and I wanted to try something new since I'm kind of a creature of habit and he said with this smirk that he had just the thing. He made this magnificent looking dessert which I didn't take a picture of because I just dove right in. He came after I engulfed the whole thing and was like \"I don't even have to ask, do I?\" And I found that to be so profound because he was that confident in his product as he should! I wish I could give it more stars. He made my always great experience even more spectacular and truly memorable. I've definitely been back since and have witnessed firsthand how he makes each customer feel special."}
{"text":"Best. Stuff. EVERRRRRR! I'm sad/glad this isn't closer to me. If it was I would literally be there every single day which isn't the best thing. I tried taro with condensed milk & boba, husband got strawberry with condensed milk & strawberries (lame) I was in heaven eating mine. Soooo creamy, sweet & delicious. I will be stopping in every single time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's about time that I review Snoh...because I love it.  If you look back through my reviews to a place call Sweet Home Cafe in Hawaii, you'll see me mention a shaved ice dessert loaded with gummies and whatnot. That was a younger me losing my baobing virginity. Needless to say, once my proverbial cherry was popped, I craved more. Unfortunately for me, Arizona wasn't well acquainted with this dessert, so my craving went unsatisfied.  This was all until I saw a link to a place called Snoh on Facebook. I legitimately freaked because I was so excited! I freaked even more when I realized it was opening in my hood, right next to my apartment (you should have seen me creeping on the owners while construction was underway)!   When the day came, and they finally opened, I was in heaven. The snoh itself was delicious, and I'm sure you've read all about it in other reviews. If you're a novice to the dessert, I do not recommend getting the tea flavors of snoh...get regular, taro (which almost tastes like a mix of the buttered popcorn Jelly Belly flavor & vanilla), or one of the fruits. My favorite flavor is the taro, and my favorite combination is:  Taro Snoh Mochi Boba Aloe Vera Jelly Condensed Milk  Aside from the snoh, I frequently get the different teas with boba added, and I'll occasionally get the milk teas.   Checking Snoh out is absolutely necessary if you have a sweet tooth, or if you're looking to expand your dessert horizons. The staff has always been easygoing, and the owners are always great to have a quick conversation with, well, when the line isn't out the door."}
{"text":"The shaved ice is ridiculously soft and fluffy - lots of toppings to choose from, and a regular size is great to share between two people! I've come back at least once a week since we found this place!"}
{"text":"SNOH Shavery Ice .... DOES ROCK!!!! Baby Blue Spoons, match my Naioooos ... Yah to kool.... Way to Go Tony & helpers. My taste buds.... Well they are  veeeery haaaaappeeee! You guys are great......  Yummmy on the taro,almond cookie,BoBa, Carmel glaze ..... I'lllllll B Bacccc :p"}
{"text":"My favorite boba drinks in the entire state!  Thank you for always having consistently good boba.  The snoh is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely something to try. It is very different than normal ice cream but it is really good! I've tried milk cream and taro and they're both really good. I would say it isn't really rich and creamy but more light (but still flavorful)."}
{"text":"My first thought when I walked into this place, it felt very much like home. There were earthy tones, art canvases for sale by local artists, soulful tunes out the speakers, and a friendly staff.   I ordered a regular sized cup with Taro, almond cookie, almonds, mochi balls, and condensed milk glaze smothered on top.   At first glance it was like no other dessert I've tried before. The layers truly looked shaved, like plowed snow from the edges of my snowboard.   As for the tasting experience, it was fluffy, as if you were to somehow turn your cotton candy into a frozen dish. It wasn't quite creamy like that of ColdStone, Thrifty, Dairy Queen, or Sonic, but I actually liked that. Meaning, I thought I ate a lot, by the look of the quantity, but I never felt full, or felt like I had a stomach ache, or had that \"Dang it! I shouldn't have ate that!\" feeling. Lol. No nonsense here. I have nothing but good applause for this new dessert in town. Absolutely delicious. I've tried just about every combination of Snoh, and their drinks as well.   I also have trouble saying no to the Thai tea with Boba at the bottom. That's my favorite drink! The orange colored one! It's deliciously addictive!   Almost forgot to mention, I really enjoyed the green tea with red bean, and black sesame."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  The staff was very nice and the snoh was amazing!  We ordered the matcha snow and the passion tea with boba. Both were great!  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Consistent, reasonably priced and SUPER friendly staff.  My only complaint is that I wish they offered an XXL size!  (Yeah...  I need to go on a diet...)  =/  Anywho...  This place is GREAT!  Highly recommended, especially with the hot weather coming.  GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good prices compared to other similar places in the valley. I like their Thai Tuesdays.   Their products are good from the drinks to the snoh. I haven't tried their Brick toast, but maybe I'll talk myself into paying $8 for it one day.   My BIGGEST complaint about this place is that they run out of boba. This is the 3rd time in a row, where we have come and they don't have it. If you are craving boba, call ahead before trekking to their establishment and wasting time/gas...I could understand if Snoh was closing soon, but tonight we came at 7:15pm, which is at least an hour and 45 before closing.   Most of the time their customer service is on point. Their deserts are good. But, having their boba topping is inconsistent, which leaves me quite annoyed."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get it? It literally tasted like a cup of shaved snow with a few toppings on it. We even tried two different flavors and they were both blah. I would never come back and would much rather have ice cream!"}
{"text":"I visited Snoh for the first time today at the recommendation of a coworker. I have never had shaved ice like this before, so it was a really neat experience. The young girl working behind the counter did a good job explaining what everything was. The shaved ice really is the texture of snow. I had coconut milk shaved ice with Oreo topping and condensed milk glaze. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! I had a hard time choosing what flavor I wanted because so many of them sounded great."}
{"text":"My first time having boba and it was great! The facility was clean and the service was fast. I got a peach slush with boba and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Good snoh, good flavors, I would give four stars if the staff seemed to care at all.  Ordering for a first timer there was no help, when I asked for recommendations I just got blank stares.  But the snohs are unique to the area and tasty.  This place has a relaxed vibe, play a game or read a quirky book while seated."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!  The first time I visited Snoh was last month, and I have been craving another visit since! There really aren't any words to describe this delicious treat - it's literally just like flavored snow melting in your mouth.  My favorite is the green tea flavored snoh. Sometimes,  green tea flavored things can leave a bitter aftertaste, but this was perfectly balanced. The tea flavor was noticeable yet it didn't overwhelm the other flavors. I added fresh strawberries and red bean as toppings, and drizzled condensed milk and chocolate over the entire thing. It was a great combo! I've also tried the same combination but with almond pudding instead of strawberries - also good, but I like that the strawberries added texture to the snoh.  Pros: fresh ingredients (I believe they do get fresh ingredients everyday, and they actually shave the snoh right in front of you. This snoh does not come out of a packaged machine,  thank goodness)!  The ambience is another plus. This place gives off a very hip and fun vibe. It's a great place to just lounge around with friends on a hot summer day.   Cons: I can see why this place could be a bit overwhelming for some people, especially if he/she isn't familiar to the concept of shaved and flavored ice. My advice? Just go for it! Pick flavors and toppings that are familiar to you, and just ask the guys who are making the snoh for their tips and advice.   This place is certainly worth the drive,  and I can't wait to make another visit soon."}
{"text":"Went back into Snoh to try and redeem the full stamp card for a large Snoh. And despite the \"training\" the staff was suppose to have had, I still had to battle the cashier. I was told once again it could not be redeem for anything but a small. I had to go as far as pull out my phone and my previous review with the managers comment. After holding up the line, I was granted the free Snoh. Updating my review to 4 stars, as once again, great product, just somewhat inept staff at times."}
{"text":"We recently visited Hawaii and fell in love with the shaved ice and wished we had something like that here in Phoenix.  Saw this place on the news and thought we'd check it out! It's awesome! They are gonna have to get a bigger place soon though! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome, everything I like under one roof. Had the Taro and red bean snoh and it was good. If you haven't tried this place then \"Do iiiiiiT\""}
{"text":"Quick service, good atmosphere.  I tried the Taro milk tea, it was delicious.  Definitely  will be back."}
{"text":"I tried two items from their menu. The #1 which was good but I really wanted to try #7. I guess I'll come back again. I truly enjoyed their wall decor. Definitely leaves you puzzled while waiting for your order. I included a picture of their iced tea which was too sweet for my liking. I added water once I arrived home. I'll update my review later."}
{"text":"Tasty milk teas but very stingy on the actual tea. 75% of the drink was ice. Sorry but for $5 it's a rip off."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened in 2013 and it is our favorite dessert place! Love the menu and the owner! This place started the \"snoh\" movement in AZ, other places who opened after Snoh don't even compare."}
{"text":"Bombing place for dessert and a hangout. Recommend anyone to try it out. I got the Matcha Regular with Lychee Jelly and Mochi with Black Sesame glaze."}
{"text":"So weird so good. The staff is always super cool and friendly and it's the perfect dessert to Cherry Blossom next door."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally some shaved \"snoh\" in Arizona! I've been waiting for this concept to come here. Usually cravable food trends in LA eventually make their way here but damn shaved snow seemed to have taken its time to get here! What took you guys so long? I've been waiting for this for years!   Anyway, I am so glad this place has opened, as you can see lol. My favorites are taro, thai tea or green tea with mochi balls & condensed milk.  I saw on my recent visit they now have brick toast! Didn't try it because I was so full from dinner and was already trying to find room in my belly for my Snoh... but next time, for sure.  Only con is that it's quite far from me so i dont get to come indulge as often as i like. How about an East Valley expansion, guys? :)"}
{"text":"First time. Boba slush was super icy! Was chewing chunks of ice! And watered down taro flavor. Disappointed because I love boba :("}
{"text":"My first time eating snow and I did get yellow snow, well it was more of a orange color.   Snoh is a new take on the whole world of frozen deserts, It is very light and full of air. And there are flavors you may not always see like Thai iced tea and taro. There are toppings like one may see at a yogurt place, but there are a few unique ones like sesame.   My real issues with the place are around price and wait time. I think the snoh is mad to order wich means the wait time and get long if they have more than say 3 customers. And the price at about $4 for a light airy ball with a topping I did not feel the value.  This place seems to be geared towards the manga animie loving crowd."}
{"text":"Had the original flavor both condensed milk glaze with mango pudding (by recommendation of the owners), red bean, and topped off with almonds. It was awesome!  Next time I'm going to have to try taro ice, with mochi & crushed almond cookies which looked amazing.  The place is beautifully decorated with a new aged modern Asian-American feel. I'm going to be a regular there very easily"}
{"text":"I'm sure you've already read what Snoh is all about, so let me preface this review with my favorite flavors for you to try if you haven't already.  Taro Snoh is my ultimate favorite. For those who have never tried it before, don't let its purple hue deceive you--it is delicious! My second favorite is the honeydew. Honeydew Snoh is a very refreshing flavor to try during this summer! Do it! The AZ heat don't got nothing on these Snohs!  Might I add, that you must try the mochi balls with both the taro and the honeydew Snoh--the coconut mochi balls are my favorite topping with both Snoh flavors thus far.  Let me tell you, never in my life have I ordered a small of something and then ordered a regular/large size of it immediately after just because I could not get enough of it... I just love how its pillowy texture and delectable flavors never leave me feeling bloated and guilty.  If you're also wondering about their drinks, they're good too! I like their Thai Tea with boba.  So if you're looking for a new chill treat to try, have a go with Snoh--it's worth it. They did receive a Best of Phoenix...  \"Snoh\" will always be year-round in Arizona for me!  Bonus: You can enjoy your delicious dessert with visuals of the artwork that's for sale; watching what's on their TVs; and playing all sorts of fun games with the people you came with!"}
{"text":"A really fun place to grab some delicious shaved snow. The menu has lots of great combinations and we went with the cereal milk, fruit loops, strawberries, and condensed milk. The shaved snow has fluffy and creamy. The toppings were a nice offset and provided just enough sweet and tart. There were lots of other combos that are sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. They also have an extensive bubble tea menu if you want to drink your dessert.  The space itself is in a strip mall parking lot but the interior has all sorts of interesting art and decor. It seems like a fun place to hang out and play board games."}
{"text":"Summary for lazy people: This place sucks.   Today I visited this \"ice shavery.\" First off, what even is an \"ice shavery?\" I thought they would have snow cones, since the name of the store is Snoh. I walked in the door, excited to eat some shaved ice. I was please at their selection of television, Bobs Burgers. I have to admit it looked pretty cute on the inside, however beware..Bibere venenum in auro!!(Drink poison from a cup of gold).  It was my turn to order and I asked the lady working what exactly they were even selling... was it frozen yogurt? ice cream? WRONG. IT WAS ABSOLUTE SHIT. RIGHT FROM THE VERY OF SATANS ANUS. The lady tried to play it off saying it was \"milk-ish!\" and has a \"REALLY good after taste!!\" WRONG AGAIN. You know how rape victims explain how they feel after they have been.. abused.. well it's safe to say that after eating at Snoh, I felt rapped. empty. used. tricked. cheated. lied to.  it felt wrong even calling this food, nay, it felt worse calling it desert.   I believe this place is from China, or Japan ....  .. ..... ... ... .... . .... . .. ... .. . annnyywwaayyyy  In this part of the review I will describe the words that come to mind when I think of Snoh: garbage, nasty, rancid, inedible, foul, rank,  disagreeable, distasteful, horrible, unpleasant, unsavory, complete waste of my time.   If I could give this place a rate on a scale from one to ten, ten being the best, it would revive an infinitely low 1.   It has been 6 hours since I was personally victimized by eating at this shavery. I want to send a message to all other survivors of Snoh out there. We will get through this.. together. We will endure the hardships of the awful Snoh. I would like to propose that annually on March 2nd, (today, the day I was duped) everyone worldwide wear the color baby blue, in sympathy, appreciation, and in honor of all those who, like myself, chose to eat at Snoh and were incredibly unsatisfied.   To whom I may have offended with this review: I don't care.  These are my feelings.  'Murica.      The End."}
{"text":"Hooray Asian ice cream is making its way from Asia to California and New York, and finally to Arizona! This sweet concoction was one of my favorite treats during my childhood summers living on the West Coast. I ate this airy, refreshingly light ice cream as a kid and it has been years since I have had it again. How could my sweet tooth forget about this delicious treat? I suppose growing up in the Midwest where I pretty much knew it would be forever until it arrived, I suppressed my dreams of eating it again.  Thank goodness a fellow Phoenix Yelper, Andreina R. for discovering this wonderful, cheery place shaved ice meets ice cream joint (Baobing) and introducing it to me! Love the mild sweetness of the milk cream. Oftentimes, I find American ice cream on the overwhelmingly sweet side, so I was very satisfied with the perfect (in my opinion) balance of sweetness and flavor with the ice cream at Snoh Ice Shavery. Add on almond cookies, mochi, sweet red beans, and black sesame syrup and I was in ice cream heaven!   I agree with a fellow Yelper that there can be a wait if there are more than three people in line. I wanted extra toppings (i.e. mango and lychee), but I gave up after waiting for five minutes for the two people in front of me and convinced myself my teeth didn't need the extras anyways! The staff was very friendly though and I will definitely be back the next time I am in Phoenix to eat more Snoh and try the variety of milk and ice teas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The taro root boba is great! I also really like the taro root snow with condensed milk."}
{"text":"I've had the Thai milk tea once and it was okay. If I really am craving it, I would take it. I do come here for the fluff shaved ice though! Being a Thai tea fanatic, I get the Thai tea with condensed milk with red beans. Although my body hates me for the sugary overload, my sweet tooth is pleased! It has a fluffy texture and it is really light. The condensed milk really adds onto the sweetness, which is what I love! Parking is a nightmare though because of the restaurant next door, but my family usually eats there and then head into here for dessert and for board games. Especially for a hot Phoenix summer, this place really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Very clean and hip place! We have been looking for a place like this similar to back home in Hawaii.  Found it randomly when doing a search.  It's kicking up the usual shave ice bowl to another level.  Prices are reasonable just like a yogurt joint.  Kid friendly because they have toys to play with lol.  Staff are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix I always have to go here. Huge servings, inexpensive, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Casual, fun place with an interesting concept and pretty good snow. Aside from their normal menu items they offer a build your own \"snoh\" which I love because who doesn't like customization?! In my case it was mango snow with mango pieces with sweetened condensed milk (which is basically a necessity when it comes to snow). The snow itself was good, not as fluffy as some other places but definitely passable.  When you walk in the decor immediately grabs your attention with a contemporary art vibe. They also offer a few board games which our group had a friendly connect four competition.   Overall it's a nice place if you want a change of pace for a somewhat different type of dessert"}
{"text":"This is the best snow ice in town! Very good with lots of flavors and toppings. They have good snow and smoothies"}
{"text":"Honest review! Went in to get some passion fruit tea with Boba. Took a sip from it. Man oh mannnnnn. That drank taste sooo water down. I'm not playing with yall! Like I have tried passion fruit tea from so many boba shop. But gosh, this was the worst. Sorry not sorry peoples! Like Idk if the employees didn't know how to make it or they were obviously lazy. Especially the guy who made it. The time I order my drank, he looked so bored working. So guessing he was lazy & probably gave me water passion fruit tea. Smh. Plus the boba wasn't even cooked all the way. If your gonna sell boba at snoh. Please know how to make boba & tea because it taste gross. Waste of my $3 something bucks. Just being honest! Dont get butt hurt, just a review. Thanks"}
{"text":"I went here on a hot February Sunday afternoon after a leisurely walk at a parkand ordered their Lychee Fruit Tea, which definitely hit the spot. My friend got their Thai Ice Milk Tea, which was equally as refreshing. Next time, I would definitely come back to try their shaved ice desserts. They have a very neat decorative wall with cute ornaments and figurines such as Batman & Robin."}
{"text":"So one day I was craving Hawaiian shaved ice and there was no place i could find. So then i googled ice cream and this place came up. I walked in and at first you may look kinda stupid and clueless like i did just because the menu items were something new to me however I did try the Thai tea ice cream topped with shaved almonds and cream sauce which remind me of Mexican Lechera (probably is). I take a seat and take a spoonful and oh my my my. Doesn't feel like your regular ice cream in your mouth. I don't know how they do it but it's just so flakey, light and fluffy, you gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Good stuff here. The Thai tea is so good. And the decorations look pretty cool and change it up from time to time"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have now been to Snoh Ice Shavery 3 times in 4 days, the first was the night before their grand opening, then their grand opening and then 2 days later! I have brought friends and family with me since my first visit!   It is genius; really genius to open up a new, delicious yet very unique dessert eatery in HOT Phoenix!   Snoh Ice is basically a light, flavored creamy ice that has been thinly shaved to a fluffy consistency, to which one can add different toppings like fresh fruit, tapioca balls, chewy flavored mochi, flavored puddings, and a sweet glaze of your choice. The great thing about this is that the basic concept is something we are all familiar with, but at every step, we are given exotic choices, to expand our taste buds' horizons (ie. strawberry or taro Snoh ice? Mango fruit or green tea mochi? Condensed milk or black sesame glaze?) Seriously, Genius.  Having grown up in the San Gabriel Valley of SoCal (where the owners are from), I have had my fair share of shaved ice and entering this place transports me back to my childhood home!! Great job, Snoh! I will be back again in 2 days, with more friends in tow, because everyone needs to know that you guys have arrived!!"}
{"text":"Thai ice with red beans and green tea mochi are deadly combination! It was so good that I can remember clearly the ice melts as soon as it touch your tongue. Yup it was THAT good :) Definitely will come back for some more."}
{"text":"It's interesting and unlike any frozen confection I ever had.  It's Fluffy Ice with the texture of Snow that's very delicate with flavor, that you Top and then add a Glaze.  The atmosphere is is fascinating like a museum with lots of pop culture to absorb.  You might get struck with confusion when trying to decide on your order as I did.   I came in thinking I'd order honeydew and then thought I'd top it with lychee fruit and then blanked out at what glaze I should glaze it with so I defaulted to ordering a coconut and topping the coconut with coconut, pineapple and butterscotch glaze. My husband just went for chocolate with chocolate glaze.  The small cup seems like a large size but it's filled with fluffy ice that has a texture just like snow but doesn't melt. Both snoh cups that I tried (coconut & chocolate) were very delicate in flavor. The coconut topping helped to add more coconut flavor and texture to the coconut. The other toppings I picked over powered the delicate coconut.  It something that I would try again but with a different flavor combination."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop by during the hot and scorching summers of AZ. You can't go wrong with getting some snoh to help cool you down. They also have milk teas and ice teas to quench your thirst. Glad that they brought snoh into the desert so that I don't have to drive to Cali just to get some."}
{"text":"When it comes to dessert, it has been Cookies & Cream or bust.   I've tried so many desserts .... but nothing comparable to the Cookies & Cream .... until now.  Snoh.   The shaved ice comes in four flavors: Taro (blech), Green Tea, Thai tea, and Mango (yum!).     It's a dessert place that is small and can get loud once it gets filled up with people.   I am happy to see a large contingent of young Asian people gather in Phoenix.   I suggest find a friend and share a large here."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for something unique. Unlike other shaved ice/snowcone places, this is not just a block of ice that gets crushed/shaved with colorful syrup dumped on top. Basically the product is like ice cream (dairy in it) that is shaved instead of regular ice. Traditional Asian combinations (taro, etc.) available, but also many standards (strawberry, etc.)."}
{"text":"Love getting my boba from here. Delicious and refreshing. My favorite is the pistachio milk tea with honey boba. However, only downside is that the parking for this establishment is always kind of annoying."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Boba place, they are really nice and fast. Also they have really fun board games, I feel welcomed there and it's a really nice environment"}
{"text":"So its the second time I have been here, and I shouldn't have waited for this review. From the moment I took my first bite I was obsessed. Even after my boyfriend and I left we discussed how great it was. For weeks since our last visit we mentioned how we should get snoh. We are pretty much replacing the words \"ice cream\" and \"froyo\"with snoh. The thought of all desserts have been replaced with the thought of our next snob fix.   Purple Fusion is delicious! Taro snoh with almond cookie crumbs, almond pudding, and condensed milk drizzle. The girl told us to add black sesame drizzle which is also bomb.I look forward to our next trip in, and to trying more flavors. That may not before a while though since we are so satisfied with our purple fusion.   STOP READING THIS IS GO GET YOU SOME!"}
{"text":"The vibes of this place feel like it's targeted for a younger crowd (versus older adults and families), but the shaved snow here is definitely good for everyone! Our group shared the matcha shaved snow combo (green tea snow, red bean, mochi pieces, condensed milk glaze) and a make your own of black sesame snow with grass jelly and condensed milk glaze. The shaved snow itself isn't too sweet, which makes it a good base for the delicious toppings and glazes. It's also a little dry, maybe because it's too frozen? Once it melts and is mixed with the glaze it's pretty creamy. Next time I come back I would get the matcha combo again but with grass jelly and black sesame glaze instead of the mochi and condensed milk. Not sure why but I saw some people's orders came on plates, which looked nicer than our paper bowls. Maybe you have to ask for them? Overall, this place is pretty creative and trendy with unique, non-traditional toppings like almond cookies and cinnamon toast crunch. They also have games available, which makes it a cool hangout spot for friends and family."}
{"text":"I'm from California , my brother lives here in Phoenix ! He is constantly bragging about his friends shop,Snoh so we decided to stop by on this beautiful evening ! And omg I'm amazed this place is freaking amazing I wish there was one back in Cali ! The staff here is so friendly , and the pictures on the walls are so dope ! I am a huge fan of Thai tea & let me tell you not everyone knows how to make it this place got it on point !!! Thanks for this amazing place tone! My son is scraping his cup for every last bit"}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best boba that I have ever had. Definitely top three in my book. Taro snoh is where it is at!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I like their taro with boba snoh the best, and you can go wrong with any of the glazes.  Some of the snohs are really sweet so you have to be careful to pair them with less sweet toppings unless you have an intense sweet tooth.  I've only had their boba once but it was fantastic.  Recently I went with a big group of people that were not familiar with the flavors and they stayed with safe things (fruit snoh with chocolate toppings) but they also loved it.    In addition, workers are always friendly and helpful, and most will give you samples if they have time.  They play cool indie music usually, have cool art on the walls and have a nice artsy nerd vibe. They have Jenga and some other games, so it's a nice place to just chill and eat/drink something delicious."}
{"text":"It's thee Bomb.com/.org/.net!! xD"}
{"text":"It was my first visit at Snoh.  Thought I'd try it out since it was next door to the lunch spot I tried.  I have had this type of desert elsewhere and I thought Snoh was just O-K.  I think it fell short with the decor and it wasn't welcoming. It appears to cater to a certain age group and or what we've heard of \"hipsters\".  Music is old school to today's hip hop and R&B. I also agree that their deserts are pricey that another Yelper reviewed.  I tried their \"purple fusion\" - taro shave snoh, almond cookies, almond jelly and instead of condensed milk I had caramel. Both the taro and the almond jelly (asian jello) was very faint in taste. I thought it was underwhelming.  I may try this place out again, but will try something very different.  I have liked taro deserts in the past, so it's not that I am not familiar with it or the Asian jello because I am familiar with it.    It seems that this is newer business, but the decor seems outdated and areas that aren't clean: tables and the couch has multiple stains. A complete turn off. Customer service is blah."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! This place was fantastic and will be seeing me again. First, I walk in with my date who has been here before, and I see a very clean and trendy place. I'm a superhero lover by nature, and there's fun comic pictures all along the walls. I'm not sure if they're made locally but they're really cool! They also have four really awesome ninja turtle drawings on the wall towards the restrooms. So cool!   Anyway, I locate the flavors on the menu, and they have quite a few. I choose honeydew flavor snoh, and ask the worker at the register what goes best with it. He recommends processed milk syrup and almond cookies. So I order it, prices are pretty reasonable, and the cashier was friendly... It doesn't take long  to come out even though there was a little line. And the dish.... Was delicious! My date got a taro one with black sesame and almond cookies and he let me try. That was so delicious too!   I highly recommend trying this little place out. As I said, it'll be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"Love this stuff. It's the first time I've come across this popular and traditional dessert in Phoenix.   The place is clean and decorated with various trendy art pieces and photos. The staff has been nice each time I've been here.   I had an original ice with mango and black sesame glaze. I liked that it's not very sweet and that it's light/fluffy and not dense. I've also tried the Thai tea ice with almond pudding and a condensed milk glaze. Thai tea definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"The shaved ice is like the Taiwanese shaved ice I've had in Taiwan where the ice is shaved so fine, it's almost like ice scream. We had the large taro & black sesame flavor with condensed milk, mochi and almond pudding. Almond pudding and mochi were pretty good, but not super awesome. And you can never go wrong with condensed milk! Overall I thought it was pricey but pretty good.  They've also got fun games you can play with friends while hanging out :)"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place, but tonight was a different story. We came in ten minutes before closing and noticed the TV menus were off. I asked the cashier if they were still open because I didn't want to order and be rude knowing it was close to closing. She rolled her eyes and replied, \"Um, I guess.\" She turns the menus back on since she knew she was trying to close early. I asked what kind of milk they used and the chubby girl making snow acted like we were doing her a disservice by asking about ingredients and replied, \"Um it's non-dairy milk.\" She acted very condescending after we were nothing but polite. When we walked out I was about to say \"good night\" but the chubby girl rolled her eyes at me because I ordered close to closing. All I ordered were two boba teas. I highly doubt my friends and I will be coming back solely on the principle of their terrible customer service and rude attitude. I understand it was ten minutes before closing, but our orders weren't complicated."}
{"text":"Shaved Ice, It's not a snow cone, not even close.   Hard to explain exactly what it is so you must just go try it.  I stepped out of my comfort zone and glad I did.  Everything was nice and clean the way it should be and super nice employees.   $4 for a small Snoh Ice was plenty big enough for two of us.  Also tried a Pomegranate-Passion fruit Iced tea that was as refreshing as it sounds."}
{"text":"I liked how they put their shaved us in a bowl and then put it onto a plate. The food presentation is really good. The shaved ice was yummy but their red bean was hard and not mushy. It tasted like it was still frozen or not cooked at all. I didn't get a chance to try their brick toast dessert, which I really wanted to. Next time!"}
{"text":"I got their thai tea shave ice with oreo crumbs & mochi bites but it wasn't impressive. However, i was impressed that they carried plastic spoons that were made of reused material, eco friendly, that's what's up! I still prefer Vampire Penguin in Sacramento though.  I did enjoy the unique \"hipsteresque\" atmosphere. Plenty of awesome works of art from comic characters to twistedly dark Adventure Time & FunkoPops with Halloween decorations mixed in. They also carried board games. Can't go wrong with the classics of Uno & Connect 4."}
{"text":"apparently this is a california staple, and it just opened here in the valley. via a friend, we popped in after dinner last night. our friend was having a difficult time explaining the texture of this new fangled ice treat, we just had to experience it ourselves.   basically, it's like airy ice crystals....like cold cotton candy texture. it's light and fluffy and airy and really good! from what i understand, its flavored ice that is shaved....not shaved ice with flavor added. anyway, it's not crunchy like ice crystals or shaved ice....it's smooth but not like ice cream or custard or yogurt. really, you just have to try it.  at the counter, you order one of about a dozen base flavors. i opted for taro, but there are many tradtional flavors. then you opt for one topping for a small, 2 for a medium, 3 for a large, or pay extra for extra toppings. then you get a glaze. the most popular at the moment seemed to be sesame seed, but i chose condensed milk and kiwi as my topping.   it was a surprise. i thought the taro would be more tart, but it really wasn't. then with the creamy sweetness of the condensed milk, it was a delicious sweet melt-a-thon on a hot summers evening. my only complaint was that they were a little stingy on the glaze, so if you eat the top portion of your treat, there is no glaze left to enjoy for the remainder of the dessert. our friend went back to the counter and asked for more glaze which they obliged.   a new way to cool off in the valley and a nice change from all the yogurt shops."}
{"text":"First time I've tried snoh ice and it didn't disappoint me. It was so good! Definitely will come back again. Serving size was reasonable and customer service was very good. The place looks cool and clean. I will try their boba drinks next time I visit."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop! The boba is easily the best tasting I've ever had, and I have trouble deciding since it all looks so good! Everyone is always pleasant when I'm there and are happy to help."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot on a hot day. We had the coconut and Thai shaved ice with various toppings. I became addicted to this in Taiwan and later living in NYC. This place has great flavors and really fresh toppings. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love it so much we drive out here from Avondale. I was excited when they opened. Finally a place that serves Asian desserts specially boba.  It's a nice place to meet with friends. They have board games, tv to watch either Netflix or a sporting event.  The place is decorated with a clean artsy design. The have paintings by local artists displayed.  The only  is the bathroom. They only have one and when it's busy or someone decides to do more than #1 it's very obvious. My suggestion they should invest in some poo-pourri.   I usually order the Thai tea with boba.  I've also had their almond milk tea with boba and lychee jelly. As for the snoh we usually order a large and share it.  That way we get to pick 2 flavors of snoh and 2 toppings.  I like green tea, taro, Thai tea and black sesame snoh.  My favorite toppings are boba, lychee jelly, mango pudding, and almond pudding (it's more like jello but with and Asian twist).  As for the glaze I like black sesame and Nutella.  If you aren't familiar with snoh its flavored ice that is shaved so fine it's like eating snow."}
{"text":"If you want snoh, iced tea or milk tea ...Snoh is such a fun place to go to.  This place has a great atmosphere and vibe. They have nice art works displayed on the wall and board games to play.   Many choices and add on for the snoh to choose from.  I had taro and strawberry snoh. Both were all great.  The small size portion were more than enough for the kiddos & I.  I also had pistachio milk tea for the first time and it was amazing.  They also have a rewards program to earn points.  I would recommend this place if you want to give it a try! :)"}
{"text":"When I used to drive by this place I was always so skeptical about a entire business just selling shaved ice. Sounded so silly to me, already making judgement on what could possibly be in this place.  I eventually walked by it after dinner next door, and oh wow. So glad I did, the place is very casual and very relaxing hang out environment could definitely see the place being a neat spot to meet up with friends and talk.   The shaved ice was totally unexpected. It was so so so good, never had a desert treat like that before ever. Definitely plan to go back and try some of their other options.  The shaved ice had the consistency of snow but how this place presents the treat is really cool. You customize how you want it first your flavor, toppings and then a glaze, which is unlike any shaved ice I've ever had, nom nom nom."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get boba in the valley. Hands Down! Boba is always fresh and available. I highly recommend the Lavender Milk Tea but other flavors are good, too. Try Honey Green, Pistachio and the house tea. The service is excellent, kids are welcome, and it's fun to play the games they provide."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Every Saturday after Cherryblossom, we go to Snoh and have delicious milk tea or what they refer to as \"snoh\" which is basically the consistency of snow. Very light, and powdery.  Positives: -Fun atmosphere  -Great products--definitely try everything once  Negatives: -Little too expensive. You get a lot, but not a lot of snoh. -Staff is a little abrasive  Overall, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly service.  Perfect for a hot days. Passion tea with Boba and coconut snoh amazing"}
{"text":"They have great flavors and I like the variety of toppings they offer. The Snoh is soft and melts in your mouth. The only thing I wish they would do with the condensed milk is layer in between the snoh. The top part is flavorful and good but midway through, it looses the flavor and doesn't taste as good."}
{"text":"I love the different flavors they have!  I've tried the honeydew mango n pistachio n coconut n I recommend all of them lol.."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't like Asian shaved ice has no soul.  Literally, they must have no sense of adventure, whimsy and lightness.  After a huge heavy meal (usually Thai or Indian) I crave something sweet but I'm so full!  What to do? Snoh to the rescue. It is sweeter than ice cream, but manages the impossible!  It is light, melt in your mouth in seconds snoh.  Forget granitas, ices or snoh cones.  The texture of this is what I imagine unicorn tears to be.  You can customize with flavor of snoh, you pick your topping(s) and a glaze (extra sugar delivery mechanism).  If I were better at math I could tell you how many combinations you can make.  They have a van for parties, so you can bring it to the office should you like.  They have punch cards (which I've run turn embarrassingly quickly).  It is bright and fun, they have interesting art on the wall that changes.  They have board games to play should you decide to not focus on the snoh itself.  Oh and it has huge stacks of dessert toast.  Just order it and be happy."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and I've already brought two friends back! I love Snoh, very unique and super tasty! The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"I tried this place out last week with my sister since we were in the area. The the place was cute and they made our order pretty quickly. They had so much on the menu that I had a hard time figuring out what to order. I finally ordered a chai tea and it tasted ok. I know they had other fruit drinks since my friends had brought me some there before , but because the menu had so much on there I had a hard time searching for it so I went ahead and order the first thing I saw that I might like."}
{"text":"I LOVE stopping here when I come to visit my family!  Customer Service is awesome!  Love the flavors they offer!  I love the Taro, with the condensed milk, and black sesame. If ever you are in the area stop by this place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Rihanna ft. Mikky Ekko - Stay)  All along it was just shavings A cold ice freezing believer I threw my hands in the air I said show me something He said, if you dare then add a little chocolate  Round and around and around and around I went Ohhh now tell ya now tell ya now tell ya now I know (what to order)  Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way it taste Makes me feel like I can't live without it It takes me to a cooler place I want some more Snoh.......!  I was \"snow\" ice shavings were first brought to my attention when I traveled to LA.  Wasn't sure what the rave was about, but I gave it a try.  At the time I thought it was a pretty cool concept and didn't know why Phoenix didn't have it --- Cause we live in the damn desert!    Finally, \"Snoh\" ice was brought to us by this place -- Thank you Snoh Ice Shavery.  You didn't even come up with some weird name, just tell us what it is; ice shavings with consistency like snow haha!    The place itself has a LA tea boba shop feel.  A lot Asian kids hanging around and reading some Manga.  Man I'm getting too old for this place!    Overall, \"snoh\" shavings here are pretty good.  Your choice of toppings from gummy bears, tapioca, lychees, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  Similar to your self-pour yogurt shops, but \"snoh\" is ice shavings so you amount of calories are much much much more lower than your average desert.  That's why I totally appreciate this awesome invention.  Not to say you should eat this for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  Everything in moderation is fine.  Our host was very gracious and also the marketer for this place.  Well done my friend, but I still think Ironman would crush Batman! Wink! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing boba. If you want quality boba come here, however the owner is incredibly impersonal.  Going to a snoh is uncomfortable and not a pleasant experience. Snoh, we love you, we just hope you change your customer service, remember your regulars, and keep serving that great boba."}
{"text":"Been here a ton and truly can't choose a favorite. Coconut, strawberry, Thai, and taro snoh and Thai tea are all great!"}
{"text":"Food: Black sesame shaved ice with red beans, almond pudding, and condensed milk. I picked the black sesame and I took the cashier's suggestion for the toppings. I liked the subtle taste of the black sesame. The almond pudding and condensed milk complemented the shaved ice. I should have passed on the red beans, I took one bite and then ate around it. lol. 3/5  Service: This place was packed on a Friday night at 8:30pm. All the tables were taken so we ended up sitting on the chairs in front of the store. The cashier was friendly. We got our snow ice pretty quickly. $4.50 for a small. 3/5  Final thoughts: I'll definitely come back to try other flavors. No red beans for me next time :)"}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes, but I have to be honest here. The owner is a nice guy. I've met him a few times before stopping in. The young man working was also very pleasant. I ordered my personal favorite, the Taro smoothie, and after a number of sips, wondered if it was just water and ice I was drinking. Sure, it was the light purple color I'm familiar with, but there was no flavor. So I politely asked to swap it out for something the worker would personally recommend, which ended up being some sort of Thai iced coffee. That too ended up being a little bland in taste, but I really didn't want to be \"that guy\", so I sucked it up, literally, and let it be.   Snoh has some very positive reviews and I didn't want to bring them down, knowing how kind the staff are, but that was my experience. On the plus side, the pop culture decor inside is fantastic. I absolutely love that. I should mention that the service was quick as well. With all the places out there that offer the same drinks, I'm not sure I'd return though after two disappointing drinks in one visit."}
{"text":"We were in Hawaii last year, so when we saw this place were on it. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was ice cream. What to say but YUMMY!!! I had a coconut pineapple Carmel delight. My sweet had coconut with lychee. We so loved the texture and the flavors. Try it yourself, as I can't dream up more words to rag on!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Dallas but i travel to Arizona about twice a year. Each time I make it out there I make it a point to stop at Snoh Ice because there is nothing like it. It is something so different and fun. The location is great, the place is clean, and the options are endless. I wish they would open something similar to this in Dallas! They did mention something about opening a location similar to Snoh in Houston but Dallas needs one too. I can't wait for my next trip to Phoenix to visit again! In my 3 day trip I managed to make it there twice, it's addicting!"}
{"text":"Really love this place compared to Snowmonster in California.. But this is the only snow place in AZ I know so.... -shrugs- This place could be better with some other snack foods like wings or nachos or something. I have salt cravings too y'know!"}
{"text":"You can play games here. It's a fun place to hang out while you eat dessert after eating at Cherry Blossom Cafe next door.  It definitely has some good flavors! Try it! I didn't see a lion dancer in the store. They should have one on request. That would be awesome."}
{"text":"The snow combinations here are very interesting. I like the more classic stuff like a taro snow with mochi, fruit, and boba. And more mochi... you can never have too much mochi. I also learned that the snow and teas here don't use milk? Can someone confirm for me if this is true? The snow has never bothered me, but I thought that was just a good day as a lactose sensitive/intolerant person. I've avoided milk teas for a few years now, but golly, if it's true that they don't use dairy milk in their tea drinks, I might be in heaven. I guess next time I come here, I'll try a milk tea or thai tea and see what happens.  This would have have been a five-star review except for the fact that a funny thing happened the first time I was here. I ordered their mango snow combo, which I think is number 6. Whoever was taking orders that night got confused between combo 5 and combo 6 (I might be confusing the numbers here because I'm going off memory from over a month ago), so they wrote the wrong number on the cup. I wound up with the Mountain Dew/Honey Dew combo instead. Since it happened to my friend who ordered the same thing as me, we realised what had happened. I thought it was a funny incident, so we didn't make a big deal of it at the time, but it is going to ding a little bit here.   Nonetheless, I really like this place for boba and snow. The pop art/nerd cultural art is really great and fun to browse too. I think if I can confirm that the items here are dairy free, I'll update it for a five-star review, so stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I have been craving red bean ice with condensed milk for years... years I tell you! I am so grateful this place opened and wish them all the success in the world.   If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and stop in. (not so much a favor for your thighs, but who's counting calories when something this delicious exists in AZ!?) You won't regret it!  The staff is great too! :D"}
{"text":"Short review: Good, but if you've had the shaved ice in SGV (San Gabriel Valley in California) then it doesn't compare. Very good though overall.  Long review: Ever since I've had baobing in SGV 6 years ago, it's stayed in my memory as one of the best desserts that AZ is missing. It's so hot here 9 months a year, why wouldn't they open one? I'm so glad it finally has its place now in Phoenix. The flavor options are limited, but they are adding more.  My favorite so far is any of the shaved ice with all of the almond options. I recommend getting the syrups/milks on the side and add on slowly as to not oversweeten the dessert. I hope they eventually expand the menu even further and add a wide variety of flavors and have even better ripe and fresh fruit toppings. My go to place for dessert anytime I'm in Phoenix. (edited for grammar) :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, its like a little gem in Phoenix! I love getting a medium size with taro snoh, red bean, mochi balls and then sesame seed sauce or condensed milk! Amazing combo! The first time i ever went there and had no idea what i was doing, the two Hispanic girls behind the cashier helped me a tremendous amount and was super nice, not making me feel like i was a complete idiot. Lol.. Another great thing is they have stamp cards! So if you're an addict like myself, you'll get a free one atleast once a month! Ps try their Brick Toast! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I usually find places like these in bigger cities like San Francisco or New York but to find this type of game room/dessert bar combo in the middle of the desert makes it extra special especially on a hot day. Stopped in here to introduce shaved ice to my bestie. I ordered the taro shaved ice with condensed milk, Mochi and fruity pebbles. The small was perfect for sharing but order the larger size if you want more toppings otherwise the small does well for two toppings. I honestly don't think there's a difference in shaved ice but if you've never had it before, this is a great solid place to start (it should have the texture of fallen untouched snow). What sets this place apart is the decor (very comic book and anime loving which I love) and the games they offer while chilling (uno, jenga, cards, connect four)"}
{"text":"Great place for great dessert and drinks.  Prices are way reasonable.  The snoh flavored ice shavings are actually light tasting and not overly sweet so it works well with the selection of syrup and toppings.  The toast tastes great too!"}
{"text":"So compared to the other times I've come here with my boyfriend (three) this one was by far the best. The guy at the counter was really friendly and was just much more welcoming then the regular staff here (So much more that I gave him a better tip then I normally would have.) Snoh has a good variety of flavors so we try to try something new each time, so far we've tried the Thai tea, mango, pumpkin spice and pistachio snoh with pistachio being my absolute favorite! (it's the sweetest of the flavors we've had) I recommend giving this place a try it is literally unlike anything I've ever had and it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This incredible place makes living in Phoenix all the worth while.  No more flying to Los Angeles for shaved ice. I think it just got BEST OF PHOENIX They deserve it.  I'm in heaven now !"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot. My favorite flavor of snoh is either the coconut milk, black sesame, or thai tea. There are so many flavors and toppings to chose from that nearly everyone will find something they like. Also, the boba is pretty descent here. The house milk tea with boba is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I live in California, so it was really nice to see shaved snow/milk tea near downtown Phoenix, where I was staying. I only tried their house blend milk tea, which was sweet for my taste, but it had really good flavor. There are a lot of tables, and a restroom as well, so it's a good place to come with a group and hang out!"}
{"text":"I love the strawberry green tea with black pearls! It's hard to find a drink that isn't too sweet! Coming from the fat straws in Texas, this place will do just fine!   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh man.....great place to get shaved ice....I had me a Mango Tango and it was the BOMB!!! Gonna try the other items cuz they looked yummy!!!....cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Gotcha matcha! Amazing! This place is so cool! Love the atmosphere. So excited to eat this! Okay, if you really like my matcha get it if you're unsure do not I was not a fan but I will say the breakfast bowl, delicious... mango, yum."}
{"text":"Love it here! Great vibes awesome service!  my cousin loves the peach tea and I love the passion fruit tea w/boba.  I recommend trying out this cool place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing and amazing.   Everything is good here so you won't be disappointed with whatever you decide to get.  It's a must to try the brick toast if you haven't"}
{"text":"Forget waxing, shaved is the way to go. (not like anyone would really wax ice, but whatevs...)  For me:  shaved thai tea, cinnamon toast crunch, mochi, and condensed milk glaze.  For him: shaved original, mochi, and black sesame glaze. Just like the one in the picture. :) For us: A unanimous rating of OMG that's delicious and light and fluffy and did I mention delicious? But the cinnamon toast crunch was the best!  This was our first time here, but won't be our last. The guy at the counter seemed kinda bored, but was very helpful when he saw that we didn't really know how to order.   While waiting for our order we learned a little about the Tibetan jumping spider and the Himalayan Chiru antelope (did you know they have twice as many red blood cells as humans? Fascinating!)...Education and Sustenance, awesome!"}
{"text":"Was not at all what I expected, but in a good way for sure. Super light and almost fluffy, if you can say that about shaved ice. Got the taro with almond cookie and black sesame glaze. Very good and a cool vibe in this tiny little joint that was packed on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"We do not have a place like this anywhere in Phoenix, and let me tell you, the place is outstanding.The employees were very nice, answered all of my questions and make good suggestions. Similarly to cold stone, you order the size cup you want, then pick a flavor of shaved ice with a free topping and free sauce. I ordered the taro shaved ice with sweet black sesame sauce and almond pudding topping. The guy suggested I get something crunchy as a topping too to balance it out, but I was too overwhelmed with new & exciting flavors I had never heard of or tasted. The shaved ice is soft and fluffy. I think I was expecting it to be more like ice chips- tough & crunchy. The texture reminded me almost of cotton candy- soft and fluffy, but condenses as soon as the wetness of your mouth hits it. It was sweet, but not overly sweet and the flavors had richness to them. Everything was fresh and completely delicious. The interior is modern and clean. Hooray for something new and delicious. I work less than 1/2 mile from here and know I will spend way too much money in this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Love the fact that they are set up, wanting you to spend some time there and hang out. They have board games and things you can play while you're chilling. The shaved ice is delicious and they have some great combinations. We need a location in the North Valley. :)"}
{"text":"We love this place!! Every time we come we get great service and yummy drinks!! They keep the lines moving fast and it's a great place to get some boba in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident but very good selection for shave ice. I've been looking for shave ice place when I travel and this place is good as some places in LA and Bellevue.  I wish they make this place a chain. Would go back again if I'm back in PHX."}
{"text":"Love the shaved ice!! Is was the best I ever had! I wish that we have this in LA where I live! This was an icestastic place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best boba in town! Love that I can order from Ubereats with them as well. Boba any time!"}
{"text":"So I'm not an ice cream person, nor do I really enjoy shaved ice, so of course I'm a bit biased. The milk cream was the only flavor I really could imagine what it would taste like (the equivalent of vanilla) and added to it, some Nutella, coconut and almonds. I barely tasted the Nutella...but I guess it was ok for what it was. The texture was a bit bothersome for me, kind of hard to eat...I think if you're into ice cream and boba...This will be right up your alley. If not, good luck deciphering the menu!"}
{"text":"When you get here it is... Decisions, decisions, decisions....  What size to get, what flavor to get, what toppings to get, and then what sauce to get....  They ALL sound so good....    After standing in line for 5 mins and staring at the menu (with my glasses on), OH CRAP it is my turn...  Small, Thai tea, mochi balls with condensed milk sauce came out of my mouth.    I waited less than 5 mins and they called me name for picking up.  It looks so yummy!!!  It was really good!  It was icier than I expected.  I thought it would be creamy.  But it is called Snoh!  It is a fun, happening place.  L, G, and I plus a few friends ran into Nader there!!  Nice to see where all the Yelpers flock to new places!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for bubble tea and ended up just buying regular thai tea. Reason is because I couldn't stand the idea of paying $7 just for bubble tea. Atmosphere was great. Tea was good. But prices are crazy. But I'm from the South, so maybe that's why I can't cough up that much money for just a drink."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but don't come here expecting like a snow cone shaved ice. The shaved ice here is almost like ice cream but it's still a little icey. It was a surprise to me at first but it's like snow almost. Hence the name snoh. Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Yes!!!! I have a twin here in Phoenix by the name of Brenda or is it Susan?! Reason is cause I come here many times and sometimes more than once in a day!  Hence my alias cause I don't want the guys in there working to know that I'm addicted to their confections!  Yummmmm, I just love everything they have to offer here.  When I would go back to Taiwan, the first place I always go to is a shaved ice place to satisfy my shave ice fantasies!!  Now I don't have to fly to Taiwan for the same delectables- hey, what I would have spent on a plane tkt, I can spend on shaved ice at this place! I tend to shy away from the Americanized flavors like strawberry and go for flavors like taro, Thai ice tea, green tea, mango, and original milk flavor. Oh wait, I think I just listed ALL the ice flavors as my favorite. Haha. I'm not surprised.  I also love all the toppings mochi ball, mango, yum yum I say.  Please the drizzles- love both the black seasame and condensed milk! Oh, and don't go for the small- go for the LARGE like I do and ask for it on a plate- they'll give you two flavors and two types drizzles and two types of toppings. Get the picture?  HEAVEN on a plate!!!!! I love the vibe of the place, hype and modern.  And the guys who work there too- they play along with me when I give them my aliases- I have to love them for that!"}
{"text":"Super unique funky place to grab tasty cold treats.   The texture of snoh really is like a light weight snow, though I haven't felt snow in ages, unfortunately.    Location:  In the same shopping center as a Cherry Blossom, a tasty restaurant.  The parking lot can get crowded midday for lunch time.    Food/drinks: Snoh offers the snoh treats and iced teas with the bubbles.  The snoh treats are interesting and unique with the base snoh treat, then toppings, plus the icing. For example, I got the coconut snoh, my topping included Oreos, and the icing was caramel. I know, a bit of an odd selection.   Service: The employees were friendly for the most part. However, one person had a complaint, and the employee was arguing about the situation.  But, it was taken care of with free food.    Ambiance: Funky - games, interesting artwork and TVs on."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, if you want to go somewhere with unique and delicious desert go here! I love the shaved ice and the milk teas are my favorite! I love the Tarro Milk tea with Leachi! They have all kinds of boards games to enjoy and have great geeks are work!"}
{"text":"When trying to figure out what I would write for this review, and how many stars to award it, I was at a loss for words.  Snoh is so unlike anything I have ever eaten before, that I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.  I am not a stranger to taro, green tea, mochi or anything, but I think I have concluded that they are just not flavors that appeal to me.  We brought my niece and nephew to Snoh because they are huge fans of frozen concoctions.  Never having been to Snoh before, we were a little lost looking at the menu.  I asked the employee what kids normally get there and he said original with Oreo and extra chocolate glaze.  I got the mango ice with mangoes and caramel glaze.  I didn't really want a glaze, but he acted like it was an essential part of the dessert.  I have to say that it would have tasted much better without the caramel glaze.  My sister in law got condensed milk on the top of hers and she couldn't even finish it.  If you want to get out of your comfort zone, this is a great place to do it.   I, however, will stick to good old fashioned ice cream."}
{"text":"Cool little spot to grab a treat and hang out. Everything I've had here is so delicious, the people are always super friendly and if you don't know what you want just ask! I ask for suggestions almost every time and it's always good."}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years, and it never fails to disappoint. Tons of selections, and pretty much everything tastes unique. Highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Almost daily habit for me!  Super yummy, great prices and their boba is best ive had!!"}
{"text":"Love it! The only place that I have found in AZ that serves shaved snow! Was totally missing LA and the many shaved snow places there. Me and my friends were REALLY excited to find that it lived up to our standards. We went last weekend and it was about the 4th time we've been there AND they had brick toast NEW on their menu. It was pretty good, except I thought the almond cookie was a little weird on it, but overall it was a great taste of home. I got the taro shaved snow with condensed milk and black sesame sauce. AMAZING if you like taro and black sesame."}
{"text":"Friend of mine recommended this place while I was out in the Phoenix area. Not what I expected. Who knew you could find a snow ice place like what you could find in LA all the way in Phoenix? Lots of great flavors and toppings, like strawberry and black sesame, as well as your sauce toppings, like condensed milk, chocolate, strawberry and more black sesame.   Lots of cool pop art and comic book related art on the walls. The patrons were not all Asian.  It's not even in an Asian part of town.  This place is killing it and that's not a surprise.  Not too hard to sell snow in the desert."}
{"text":"Friday night, homework all completed, quarter tank left, where does this young college student go too?! SNOH!!! Yup, no parties but this ever-so delightful gem in Phoenix. The shaved ice is phenomenal, not to sweet, but enough to hit the right palette. Customer can get a choice of ice, toppings, and sweetener- I chose the condensed milk. Yummm... Anyways, great place to socialize with friends while at the same time trying there delectable treats. Great find!  PS: I drove 20 miles from Mesa on a Friday night to get here. That should say it at all!!"}
{"text":"Sweet little local dessert place, everything is delish and staff is very knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Updating from two weeks ago. Toddler didn't like the texture, more for me. Wish it was closer, then I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. My shaved ice looked nothing like the pictures on yelp and they were out of everything. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"The best thai tea and taro!  Very pleasant environment,  love the decor, and great service."}
{"text":"Although a bit overpriced, this place is quite good. I have been here several times now and have tried the green tea and thai tea flavors; the ice is very fluffy and light like snow. My favorite is green tea ice with red bean, almond pudding, and condensed milk. I try to stop by when I go to Cherry Blossom. I wish this place was closer to me!"}
{"text":"I tried the thai tea with boba, red bean, and condensed milk glaze.  Yummy!  I will go back again - probably on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Every time I am in the Greater Phoenix area I always make a stop in to Snoh. Sure there is a line, but trust me it is worth the wait! If you like ice cream and shaved ice, this place is the place to go because it is smack dab in between the two kinds of desserts. My personal favourite is their Taro with mochi, boba, and condensed milk, but I have yet to have something there that isn't just flat out delicious. Give this place a shot for dessert when you're nearby!"}
{"text":"stopped in cause i love Shave Ice but it's hard to find good stuff here.  the place is a decent size and very clean inside.  I ordered the Original with mangos and Milk Glaze.  i bought the Small cause it seemed really big (and it was really big) but it was so amazing that i wished i got the large.  the guy working the counter was friends and helpful and i can't wait to go back and try some other flavors!  People just need to be aware, this is NOT a snow cone place, if you are looking to get one of those you need to keep looking!"}
{"text":"I'm from out-of-town but I tried this place a few years ago and absolutely fell in love with it even though I am not a dessert person. The Snoh was so light, full of flavor, and just melted in your mouth. I could not wait to return to Phoenix to try the infamous Snoh again.  A few years later I finally make my return and maybe I had been hyping it up too much in my mind for the last few years. Did they change owners? Not sure. The Snoh did not taste as great as it used to. My friend and I ordered the milk cream and taro Snoh and it just didn't have the same great texture and flavor as it did a few years ago. My milk cream Snoh just tasted like  ice. Luckily, we added a condensed milk glaze to amp up the flavor. The honey boba is great. I was disappointed they were out of mango and almond pudding...we settled for custard pudding and mango pudding which were both pretty standard..."}
{"text":"My favorite here are Gotcha Matcha and Thai tea. Took my mom here and she loved the Gotcha Matcha."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place waiting for some dominos pizza (not good but still good). Loved the interior of the place. Felt like I time traveled to China.   The concept is interesting and perfect for the high temperatures in Phoenix.   A great healthy alternative.  Many Many flavors to choose from. It being my first time there, I had no idea what I was doing so I just threw some ingredients together. Wouldn't mind visiting again."}
{"text":"I have loved SNOH for quite a while. I tell people about SNOH all the time. As yummy as SNOH is, their employees and customer service priceless. Smiling, helpful, engaged and present. Yesterday, my friends son knocked his SNOH over during a competitive game of Jenga. Being only seven years old, he of course was distraught. The staff at SNOH were quick to console him, come help clean and offer to replace his SNOH.  #hellohumankindness"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing staff! I recommend this place to everyone who love desserts that aren't overwhelmingly sweet.   Snoh has that mix of traditional Asian sweets with an American twist which is awesome! I love the different spin they take on sweets I grew up with as a child.  Just as awesome as any iced shavery in California."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I thought I was an expert on shaved ice places, but man, was I ever wrong. Bahama Bucks has always been my favorite place, but this takes it to a new level.  First off, the ambience. You walk in and everything is crisp and clean. Definitely a modern feel, with a bit of comic book/gamer twist. You have art for sale on the walls next to posters of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.   You choice from 3 different sizes, 9 different flavors, 18 different toppings, and 5 different glazes on top. If you have any questions, make sure to ask the staff as they were quite helpful! I know other reviewers have commented on the service being shotty, but maybe they hired new people as everyone there was super nice and accommodating.   I didn't really know what to expect when I got my order. I made sure to get a little piece of everything in my first spoonful. Let me tell you, you have never tasted anything like it. The consistency was super smooth, and the flavors just jump out of the bowl. It was the best dessert I have ever had in my life. ever. bar none.  I did get a chance to try their Thai Iced Tea with Boba. It was really good. Nothing super special, but a good complement to the entry. They have a good choice of milk teas and smoothies as well.  Do not forget to bring your loyalty stamp card as you will be back!  I had gone to Cherry Blossom a few dozen times, and was always to full to try Snoh. Now, I will be sure to always save some room!"}
{"text":"The staff is so dope here.  Especially the chick with the nose ring she brought out the vibes to this place. Keep her and promote her. She was just dope. The guy who made my snoh had the vibe too and made my snoh look good. My friends loved the snoh so this is why I'll give it 4 Stars. The snoh was not for me. I forced myself to like this snow like ice-cream but ehhhhh not for me.. the flavors was subtle but the toppings? Yummmm fruity pebbles and m&m's and caramel yes please!"}
{"text":"When ever we come to Arizona  we visit Snoh. it's one of our favorite place for desert . We always have a good experience , but this time my wife had bought a groupon deal. The person behind The counter was not so happy about us using the groupon. This was the first time that we had used Groupon so we had some question about how to use it. He was not to happy and didn't want to help us,so We went and sat down and fingered it out And come back to the counter and ordered Our desert. Our coupon was for $10 and our Snoh came to $7 . I asked him if we would get $3 credit and he gave me the dirtiest look and said no. So I ordered one more item and I owed $1.90 more. After I paid him he asked me if I had anymore questions . Wow ready,,, we got our Snoh and it was good but we never got our Vietnamese coffee. My wife told him that we never got the coffee  and his reply was I thought I gave it to you and I'll make another one... We never got the first one so no I will me you another one is wrong. The right answer would be I forgot to make it for you I'm sorry  and let me make one for you now. We will give them another try and hope that this was just a bad day for him and every customer is important Groupon or not.-"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and both times they have run out of cups! It is very maddening. Please have more cups. I do have to say the shaved ice is really good but Im really just interested in the Boba."}
{"text":"I'm clearly late to the Snoh party but I concur with all the good things said, and my worst at Snoh has never been truly \"bad\" in terms of service, even if not quite as on the ball as at their best.  I generally find the staff pleasant, helpful, and patient as I and others dawdle for what must seem an eternity to staff (and those behind us in line) in making our decisions from all the possible combinations.  I love the taste of this stuff.  Everything combination I've had in 3 or 4 visits, whether a green tea, thai tea, strawberry, or mango base.    I spent a year in the northeast of mainland China over a quarter century ago (just call me \"lao\") and all snow we got quickly received a generous coating of coal dust, making it roughly as appetizing as yellow snow, so even after a year in the motherland,  I can tell you that for me it's a new and unique treat and beats red bean popsicles all to pieces!  There is nothing comparable to this incredible lightness of being combined with all the of lush refreshing flavors and comforting coldness in the Arizona heat (Well, unless you stop in for \"snow\" at Pho Avina way up North 49th Ave & West Thunderbird way).    While I'd agree at least a bit with reviewers who thought each size somewhat over-priced for what you get, as much as I'd like to wallow in a field of snoh, make snoh angels  - and EAT THEM (preferably for free), I think the prices not terribly out of line for what is at this time a new, unique desert dessert adventure in a unique and comfortable, even sophisticated, setting.  It's kind of like the fabled \"Starbucks experience\", but younger, in lighter color Copenhagen wood tones with a modern, casual, comfortable, distinctive-but-not-overwhelming Asian flare.    They're not going for discount volume here, but even so, the smallest serving is sufficient to provide an adult a good taste, cool you off, whet the appetite to return, and simultaneously allow you to feel remarkably virtuous for having responsibly indulged in only this dessert lighter-than-air, and having not over done it. That said, what I really want is a bucket for $5 and a spoon.  A large spoon.    Note that it's perfectly acceptable to eat yellow snoh - as long as it's mango."}
{"text":"Stop...just stop what you're doing right now and GO TO SNOH! This is by far one of the most unique places I have ever been. It's much more exciting than your average frozen yogurt or shaved ice place. The decor is friendly and inviting, the customer service impeccable, and the \"snoh\"...oh the snoh...where do I begin? I had the green tea with mochi balls, red beans and condensed milk. It was satisfying without being too filling, bursting with flavor, yet delicate, and just basically awesome! Needless to say we licked our plate clean. I'm already formulating what my next treat will be!"}
{"text":"The snoh is really good. It's a busy place with fast service. I didn't really like the boba there it was too chewy. But if you're going for the snoh you are in the right place."}
{"text":"house blend milk tea - pretty good almond milk tea - pretty good pistachio milk tea - really good it's trendy and clean inside  service is nice"}
{"text":"Oh so in love with this place! Boba taro tea (vegan)! Shaved ice is a healthy and delicious alternative to ice cream. And with all the Asian toppings available, it's a perfect place for kids and adults to try something new like mochi balls!  Clean and service is fast and friendly. We like the assortment of games that you can play there with the kids or your date. Especially like the fighting robots!!! Fun!"}
{"text":"Such a nice atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious snoh!! If you don't know what to pick, the staff is very helpful and they will recommend flavors if you need help :) will definitely come back before I go back home :)"}
{"text":"I Grouponed here and tried snow for the first time, it was pretty good, but it was really \"airy\". The guy working there wasn't the friendliest either, I asked if he could give me a second since it was my first time (and made sure there were no customers behind me) and he was kinda irritated..but I got my stuff and left. I've tried the Strawberry, Green Tea, Mango, and Taro flavors. For $7, you get a huge tub with two toppings and one glaze. My favorite is the Green Tea, cause I'm obsessed with green tea anything. Then this week I was craving green tea and tried Tea, Snow, and Coffee in Tempe closer to where I moved to and it was soo much better. There, it was creamier and less filled with air, but still very light at the same time. The people who work there are always friendly as well:)"}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews for this place so decided to give it a try! I've had something like this in LA, so was super excited when I saw that they have something similar in AZ!  My boyfriend and I headed over after dinner, and there was no line when we got there. I saw all these amazing flavors, and wanted to try the Mango and Taro. Since we just finished dinner, I asked if I can get two flavors in the small cup. She said no, but said I could if I picked the regular size cup.   So we decided, alright, we don't drive 30 minutes over to this side of the town often, so let's get a regular size cup and try two different flavors! As we told the girl our order, the guy making the Snoh jumped in and said \"We can't do that.\" The girl said, \"I thought you can have two flavors if you get the regular size. I already told them that they can get two flavors with the regular cup.\" The guy says, \"No, they can't do that. They can order a large cup and get 2 flavors.\"  First of all...WHAT?! WHAT?! How hard is it to shave two different flavors of ice into one cup? I'm sorry, but that service is ridiculous. Second of all, if the girl that works there told us so, she should honor it to us this one time. Third of all, another guy that \"works\" there helped make our small, one flavored Snoh...was sitting on the only couch available when we got there, and went back to sit on the couch with a girl after making our Snoh. If you work there...I don't care if you're a worker or the owner of the store...you don't sit on the couch and play with your phone.   So aside from the terrible service, the Snoh was very good! Ordered mango Snoh with red beans and condensed milk. We were full but we were able to finish that baby up!  Would I go back? Probably not. Unless I'm by that area and am seriously CRAVING it. I rather spend my money for great dessert and great service."}
{"text":"What's better than a shop that offers boba tea, blended slushie/smoothie drinks, and shaved snow? Having them come out to festivals you're going to attend! I've never physically visited the shop but have visited their stands at festivals such as Phoenix Chinese Week, Arizona Matsuri, and the Arizona Asian Festival. I started with their boba slushies/smoothies. The boba was cooked perfectly. I came back to try their shaved snow, so far I've only tried their Thai tea and taro shaved snows. The consistency is fluffy and not runny, the way I like it."}
{"text":"We had mango flavor shaved ice here. It was just like what I got in Singapore and hongkong. It made me so exciting! I also tried their house blend milk tea. It was so good! I love love love! I'll come back again pretty soon. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a fast refreshing sweet treat. Not to mention a great place to hang out with all the games and art work."}
{"text":"A sweet surprise.  I got the Thai Chew (#12).  I cant tell you all of the flavors, but I know it was delicious.  It was not too sweet as well.  What really surprised me was the unique texture of the shaved ice.  It was smooth and surprisingly did not feel cold in my mouth.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from California and my cousins brought me here in June for the first time. Definitely loved and now I went back to Arizona this month and I had to make sure I'd stop by here right when I landed.  Snoh is really good and has great service! Everytime I go to Arizona this will be my first stop always."}
{"text":"Snoh is dreamy. Pistachio snoh, honey Boba, almond pudding, and condensed milk.  TDF! Our family lives it!"}
{"text":"Found a hair intertwined in my ice cream and the manager blamed it on my girlfriend claiming that it was her hair. My girlfriend is blonde and it was a black nappy hair. Go figure the gal making the ice cream had nappy black hair. The manager then continued to glare at me while we sat in there. We went a second time and the same manager with the glasses kept staring at me. Might I be murdered if I go a third time? Not sure... Sketchy"}
{"text":"This is the first time and only time I've tried anything like this and I absolutely LOVE this place and product.. Unique, style, & modern.. Awesome.. This is definitely a place is go back to anytime!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Love all the original artwork for sale and the overall vibe. I tried the taro shaved ice, green tea mochi, and condensed milk. My boyfriend had the green tea shaved ice, boba, and condensed milk. Both were delicious and not overly sweet. I am excited to try all the other combos. :-)"}
{"text":"The best end to a date or treat in the middle of the day. Light and so many options. I usually do a honeydew shake my son gets chocolate with  cinnamon toast crunch on the top with a drizzle of chocolate and my boyfriend gets pistachio with coconut. They have many cereal toppings and many teas boba teas. Many different flavor options. Something for everyone here. My son says he likes ice cream better. I don't blame him ice cream is life. But in the summer a nice cool shaved ice treat is just what I need and love! I recommend this place for anyone! Indomt understand the boba tea thing looks nasty but people seem to love it. Try it out soon."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. Went there last weekend when I was in the area and haven't stopped thinking about it since! At first I was a bit confused about some of their Snoh bowls, because I didn't understand that these were not snow cones--they're more like shaved ice cream with the texture of fresh powdered snow. I got Mango Snoh with strawberries, mochies, topped condensed milk, and my boyfriend got the Breakfast bowl-- creamy milk Snoh with strawberries and fruity pebbles. All I have to say is that it was so good that we craved it all week and drove almost an hour round trip just to get it again today. I wish they would open more locations!! I highly, highly recommend this place. It is both delicious and a fun experience."}
{"text":"If you want a different type of dessert pick me up, Snoh has you covered. It's a cross between shaved ice and ice cream. #3 is delicious, and looking forward to trying other flavors!"}
{"text":"This place with its shaved ice is a completely new concept to me. Probably half of the items on the menu I have never heard before but for the two times that I have been here, I have enjoyed everything I ordered. It may not be for everyone but I think it's definitely worth checking out. The staff is very patient and helpful as well. I'll be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"So good! So glad I came in to try this \"snow\". We get there on a Sunday night and the place is full of people, pretty cool, loud, a little rowdy but awesome nonetheless. Even with all the orders, we got our snow pretty quickly. I had the boba in my passion tea and it was delicious!! They also have games for you and your group to play while you chill there. Super cool place(:"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! So so so good.  I've been coming here for a few months. They have anything from smoothies, milk teas, and of course snoh!  They so many topping to pick from, their milk teas are pretty good too.  The environment is chill and relax. Great for family or friends hanging out. They have a couple of board games to help pass times. It can get rather busy at times but the service is always quick and customer service is on point. I will recommend this place if you haven't been! My person favorite is purple fusion with boba and mochi."}
{"text":"Oh, Snoh, how I love you soh! This place is great. Think ultimate snow cone- except the ice isn't packed very tightly so it's light and fluffy, and instead of straight sugar syrup the flavors are creamy and refreshing- with toppings galore!  It's like a raspado's Asian cousin. The staff was very helpful, offering pairing suggestions for this newbie. I tried the Thai tea flavor with mochi and boba, then the green tea with pineapple and almond cookies on a second visit. So good."}
{"text":"Was in the area so I finally stopped by. Busy but it only took a few minutes to place my order, then I waited 7 minutes until it was ready. I got Thai Tea snow with boba and Nutella glaze. So good! I don't really like the icy consistency but I mixed it and then it was creamy and delicious. Not enough Nutella but I added some when I got home. Friendly staff! Hope to be back."}
{"text":"The ladies working were incredibly nice! They were confident about the flavors on the menu and helped me try out a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place to have dessert after a heavy meal. My friend and I come here quite a bit and each time we leave happy and smiling. We always get the thai tea, it's the perfect balance of robust tea and sweet cream without being so sweet that you're thirsty for water.  The decor is very modern, with art work all over the wall mixed in with two hd TVs, the place itself has great lighting and isn't dark at all, gives it that perfect weather hangout atmosphere and the best part is that everyone is welcomed here from kids to adults and hippies to hipsters LOL.  New favorite flavor is the the regular cream milk tea accompanied by the red velvet(limited time flavor) with strawberries all over, perfect for valentines. Check the photo :)"}
{"text":"I love Snoh! The Thai tea with but boba is my favorite! I get it all the time it's a guilty pleasure"}
{"text":"Love this place. So sad when we moved further away from it, but worth the drive. The fiancé and I love splitting a medium Thai tea snoh with boba and mochii drizzled in condensed milk. Their cotton candy flavor is a second favorite of mine. Our go to place when friends and family come from out of town. The art hanging around is super cool and the place is always clean. The line gets a little crazy around dessert time, but the service is quick and painless. Definitely worth signing up for their phone communication, they are always bringing me back in with those deals and Thai tea Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take kids & enjoy your time. The snoh and teas are great, but the customer service is horrible. They've messed up my orders three different times and each of the times they question me like if I'm lying. I returned the tea once cuz it was made wrong and the girls behind the counter kept starring. The manager tried to tell me that I was wrong. I don't think I'll go again after these incidents. Other than the people, the snoh and teas are great (if you get the right one). If you go in the middle of the day, the employees are much nicer."}
{"text":"This is one one my favorite places to get boba! The flavors they have for all the drinks are just perfect! I always get the House Blend Milk Tea With Boba It's super affordable too! All the workers are super friendly which is a Huge bonus. Definitely worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"this place is Special...it is no Shaved ICE place like Ive seen in the valley...its SHAVED yes but the way they explain how is nothing short of really smart and lots of ingenuity ...here you don't have to worry about sticky messy syrup everywhere. and every bite has your flavor...its really impressive.  want to get your email...how about their free wifi..yes this is an indoor place so when its 120 your not melting outsidse trying to enjoy your treat  they have tvs art work you can purchase right off the wall and uno . books. dominos//  its a really hip place with great people to meet and talk to...I really enjoyred it and will be returning"}
{"text":"Well I was a little nervous to try this whole boba thing but now I'm hooked! The honeydew was a bit too sweet for me but almond milk tea is right up my alley. Next on my list is the red velvet snoh. I may even venture out to having some red bean or rainbow jelly toppings! Hooked for sure"}
{"text":"The shaved ice is unique and good.  The ambiance and service lacking...Would i come back? no...not even if i was craving it because service SUCKS...  Rude wanna be's here.    I'd give 1 star but that wouldn't be fair to the shaved ice."}
{"text":"Super Yummy! The place is incredibly delicious! The staff is friendly and helpful with the daunting task of choosing your flavor and toppings. The taro ice with green tea mochi balls and boba is my favorite! They also have boba tea which I'm excited about because there isn't any place around here that has that. Go try it if you haven't already. Best desert in town! ADDICTED!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My friends and I come here for dessert every time we eat out! I always get the taro and pistachio snoh! The condensed milk is to die for!! But seriously, this is my favorite place to get shaved ice! Their milk tea is super good too! And their brick toast is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, there was a time when snoh was what many people considered to be the best-kept secret of Taiwanese culture. But that seems to have slowly started changing over the last several years - as places like this have started popping up more frequently.  If this were the first snoh place I'd ever tried, I'd probably be a bit more enthusiastic. There's a bit of a novelty appeal for many people, as it's something different in a neighborhood that's mostly filled with your usual ice cream/gelato joints. I appreciate that. But if you walk in here with pre-established expectations based on prior experiences, you'll probably just find it to be average at best.  By the time my girlfriend and I finally got around to trying this location, we'd already tried snoh at a handful of Vietnamese restaurants as a quietly advertised dessert option.  First of all, the fact that this place actually markets itself as a snoh shop, rather than tucking it away as a hidden dessert item that's buried amongst 500 other drinks and dishes is very smart marketing. Snoh can easily stand on its own as a great treat, similar to ice cream or shaved ice. And when done right, it can be quite impressive.  I really like the setup, especially all of their wall art, showing various nods to 8-bit era video games. There's Jenga (a game synonymous with snoh for some reason) and a handful of other board games available for play. They also serve slushies, teas, and brick toast. We finally tried it on a recent visit and were very disappointed. From what I read brick toast is supposed to be baked. They merely cut a slice from a (very dry) loaf of bread and dumped toppings on it. I'm still not sure if this was a mistake or if they're just lazy in their preparation.   For a first timer, you'll probably really enjoy it. It's light, fluffy, and much easier on the stomach than ice cream. They offer a variety of flavors and toppings here, which is far more vast than what you can find at other places. Unfortunately, at least by my tastes, I feel the snoh is a bit on the icier side. The best snoh I've had usually steers more towards a creamier texture, but who am I to say what's right and what's wrong? The place feels kind of like a high school hangout - not that there's anything wrong with that.  There's a second location that also appears to be doing quite well, so it appears that snoh is no longer a secret.  Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Wonderful little shop. Staff is amazingly kind and helpful. I had never tried anything like their shaved ice cream, but it was wonderfully delicious and fluffy. I would definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times and every time it's been amazing. They bring you a new style of dessert. There are plenty of items to choose from. I just loved the shaved ice and the brick toast. Every one that works there understands that it's a different style dessert and are happy to help you."}
{"text":"food: mango tango. they ran out of fresh mangoes and subbed in lychee. which was a fine alternative. the caramel made it sweet. it's not big on the mango flavor. enough to make it a dessert. ***3/5  service: it can take some time to get your order. there are board games around to kill time. free wifi too. the place looks cool. lots of pop culture art pieces around.  ***4/5  value: it's fairly large cup. perfect to share with somebody, but also doable on your own. i take it as a challenge for myself. ***4/5"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a place like this, and I have finally manage to find one. This place has a nice ambiance and the people here are super friendly. Ordering to go is super simple and you get it fairly quickly. Their menu is very easy to chose from and they have combos that make it easier to chose from. Next time I'll have to try the brick toast."}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream & dessert place, 10 miles away from where I live. I wish they can open a store in Tempe"}
{"text":"So yummy. This is my ultimate treat. I love the sesame drizzle and the condensed milk drizzle. Try the Thai Tea flavor"}
{"text":"Visiting from Boston, my friends and I scavenged the area for good shaved ice. We landed at Snoh and what a pleasant experience we got! This is an AWESOMELY decorated and hip dessert joint that offers custom or premade shaved ice bowls, slushies, bubble tea, ice cream, Vietnamese iced coffee, Pocky, and Hi Chew. I tried the houseblend milk bubble tea and it was perfect! The bubble teas come in one size - a large. The boba was of the perfect texture and the milk tea was flavorful without being too sugary.   The customizable Snoh bowls are AWESOME! You can grab a small, medium or large.  Flavors: black sesame, coconut, cotton candy, honey dew, matcha, mango, pistachio, red velvet, strawberry, taro, Thai tea  Toppings: almond cookies, almond pudding, banana chips, cinammon toast crunch, coconut flakes, custard pudding, fruity pebbles, graham crackers, grass jelly, green apple jelly, honey boba, lychee jelly, m&ms, mango, marshmallows, mango pudding, mochi balls, Oreo cookies, pecan, pineapple, rainbow jelly, red bean, sprinkles, sliced almond, strawberry, taro pudding  Glazes: black sesame, butterscotch,  caramel, chocolate, condensed milk, and nutella  I wish I lived around here to come back! The staff was extremely friendly. The owner was manning down the counter and talked to us while we were chilling and playing board games! If you're reading this, thank you for the amazing experience and delicious shaved ice and bubble tea!   There's plenty of parking options at this strip mall. Definitely come by for dessert and when you do, check out the wall art and grab a cute sticker. There's plenty of seating options, WiFi, fun wooden mustaches and glasses to take pictures with friends, as well as board games like Jenga and Connect 4."}
{"text":"The snoh and teas here are great! Winter melon tastes exactly like an actual winter melon! Other flavors taste like the actual fruits as well. Their service is good and sometimes there is an extremely long line though."}
{"text":"Snoh is one of the most well established Asian hang out spots I have ever stepped foot in. There is boba, shaved ice, shaved ice and boba and their new brock toast. The variety of flavors is decent for boba but the shaved ice is really what makes the place special. The snoh has the fluffiest texture and each flavor such as thai tea, matcha, mango and cream. The toppings just add an extra pop or crunch to the cold fusion in your mouth. The ice is not too sweet so the addition of glaze creates the perfect amount of sweetness for a refreshing dessert. I recently tried their brick toast which is the most delicious way to get diabetes if you are into chocolate and banana with vanilla ice cream.         The vibe is quite chill and their music selection is alright, at least it's not too annoying or loud.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast except for the brick toast which takes them 10 minutes but it is worth it. Overall I recommend the place for just a chill hangout as there are games and such in the back and interesting decor that is comfortable to relax in."}
{"text":"So good!  It's the perfect combination between shave ice and ice cream.  It's so fluffy and melts right when it touches your tongue like real snow.  Such great toppings and flavors to choose from and I love their mango pudding!  Slightly expensive for my taste, but it is a specialty item.  Perfect for a hot day in Arizona!"}
{"text":"If you want brick toasts, go on Thursdays. They sell out quick because that's is the only thing this place is really famous for. I like their drinks but their shaved snow was just not the best for me since I've had better. The brick toast is my favorite so I try to get one every time I'm in the area on Thursdays. It's always sold out on weekends and Fridays because they get really busy those three days. The place is nice to chill at as well since they have games like connect the dots and jenga to play while waiting or just killing time with friends. They also have free wifi and the password is located near the little hidden Asian snacks area by the cashier."}
{"text":"My sweet tooth go-to!! Really chill environment and the shaved ice is just addicting. Have been here so many times and I can't get enough."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  One gal had a pineapple and condensed milk which had a good texture and a smoothness like ice cream but much lighter.  Another had strawberry snoh with red beans.  Good combo.  Even the plain grape snoh was tasty and refreshing.  The general atmosphere was friendly and inviting.  It wouldn't take much to get us to go back."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing dessert place in Phoenix. They have the best snow in all of Arizona!   The mix of ice cream and shaved ice is to die for. The flavors that they carry, along with the toppings and drizzle flavors are all so good.  If you come here you won't regret it, it's much better than any Coldstone or Dairy Queen.  Just be open minded and give Snoh a try !!"}
{"text":"Had the taro shaved ice with lychee jellies and crumbled almond cookie. It was fantastic!!!!!! The combo of flavors and textures were perfect. My dessert wasn't to sweet or to filling. It was just right. Yummmm!!!!!!! I'll be back very soon. It was so worth the drive! :)"}
{"text":"Fluffy sweetness in the hot Arizona weather with customized toppings?  I'm in! As a former Lollicup employee in my minimum wage days, this place is legit and even better than Lollicup.  Perfect boba texture and flavorful tea that is a relief from the powdered stuff.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I was only visiting Arizona and trying to decide which good food places would make my trip worth while and this place definitely made the cut. I loved the ice cream here because it was so refreshingly different. It's still creamy, but compacted together on a plate rather than a cup or cone and the flavors are ones that are hard to find at any other ice cream or frozen yogurt place. If you're looking for a regular cup of ice cream, this isn't for you, but if you want to try something original with different flavors and texture, I definitely recommend Snoh."}
{"text":"BIG fan!! A friend of mine and I were walking by and thought we'd drop in and I must say I'm so glad we did! The place is charming, the staff was wonderful, a very tasty treat and I will be back! I can't wait to try other flavor combos =)"}
{"text":"Snoh is a little creative ice boba shop. There are no boba smoothies. Do not come here if you are looking for a boba smoothie. The closest thing you will find to a boba smoothie are the slushes. I had the mango slush with honey boba and boy did i savor it! Refreshing and tasty!! Perfect for those warm days :) my husband had the strawberry slush with honey boba. We weren't able to try any of their desserts, but we will be back another day to give that a try.  The parking is tight and the location is among a good plaza. The restrooms are male/female and always dirty- boo.  Based on drinks alone, i give 5 stars. Overall though.... 4. Great ice shavery but it needs to be kept clean."}
{"text":"Ice, Ice Baby!   This tasty treat tantalizes your taste buds like none other could, and the fun games, gadgets and eye candy that adorns the walls are the delicious cherries on top.   Despite countless visits (sometimes even within the same day, shhhh) I never seem to tire of scraping my bowl down to the very last sliver. Even after returning from a very extended vacay in Asia (home of all things boba) this was one of my very first, very satisfying stops.   Taro with condensed milk, mochi, and lychee is the go-to that I crave, but I dare you to discover a combination that disappoints.   If and when you make an attempt to fulfill said dare, (why wouldn't you?) do be sure to place some $ into the super nifty super hero tip jar (preferably Ironman's). You gotta give kudos for creativity and the  customer service is always impeccable. Also, whomever is in charge of the music playlist is really on to something good.     Pretty sure it's impossible to dislike this place, so just go. Eat, play, enjoy:)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Had Snoh two days in a row ! The green tea snoh with red bean and custard is my favorite. Great tasting milk teas also!!!! So addicted !!"}
{"text":"The best shaved ice known to man. We just ordered it off of Uber eats. Unbelievable experience!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SNOH! ^__^ You will find all your shaved ice dreams at this Ice Shavery! Especially with the wide variety of ice cream flavors form toppings... it's hard to ever come across a customer not saying good things about Snoh! I love the staff as well. They are nice genuine hard-working people that a few I've known personally who I can say deserve to be apart of such a great business. Snoh has definitely made an impact locally in AZ and they deserve to have been able to open up a second shop in Downtown Phx. EVERYONE must try Snoh, I promise you'll be dying to come back for more xoxo"}
{"text":"5/29/13  Winding down from the CMYE at Del Frisco's, someone brought up an impromptu UYE at Snoh Ice Shavery, and since I've never been and had been craving for shave ice, such as that I experienced in Honolulu, I needed no other prompting to go.  Snoh is located in the same plaza as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe (another bookmark I've had since moving into the valley many, many years ago- now I know where it's located, I'm going to have to stop in for a try!)  Parking looks very decent for the number of businesses around here- a big plus!  The line can get long very fast, but the two guys behind the counter take the orders very quickly (or as quickly as they can when newbies, such as myself, come in for the first time and are faced with so many choices!).  I decided to take the easy way out and try a couple of shaved ice flavors and a few toppings, so I went with the \"large plate\" for $6.75.  I spent my first decade, born and raised, in Manila, so I am very familiar with taro (we Tagalogs know it as \"ube\") ice cream, so I had to try Snoh's icy version, and added Green tea to the mix.  My toppings were cubed mango, red mung beans, and black sesame condensed milk.  It took about 8 to 10 minutes, but we had a large group present, and our lively conversations made the wait very easy.  This is what waited for me at the counter when my name was called... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/snoh-ice-shavery-phoenix?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#jyv16LcyCFb3Cz-Q3CkDxg  I have to say that while it didn't look very appetizing (mango cubes didn't present well, and neither did the black sesame drizzle-- why not just pour the milk, let it cascade down the icy landscapes, and just sprinkle roasted black sesame seeds on top?), I loved the taro, red mung bean, and black sesame condensed milk combo.  I thought the condensed milk overpowered the green tea ice, and I wouldn't order that match again.  However, I wouldn't mind having ust green tea ice.  It tasted very fresh and clean-- a great palate cleanser after a great meal.  Cool artwork and backsplashes.  Nice concept of posting photos of guests on the TV display, but does the staff check for total complacency of all those present in the pics, I wonder?  I can see privacy breaches becoming an issue...   Will be taking family over for a few treats here in the future, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I stumbled upon Snoh Ice Shavery while in the parking lot of Oreganos next door because I loved shaved ice. Overall it was alright. I was expecting more of a straight forward shaved iced option which I didn't find or possibly just didn't see so I settled for a passion fruit slush. I opted to get whipped cream on the top for an extra 75 cents. The whip cream ended up turning into a creamy fruit mush at the end which I totally loved and my boyfriend hated. Fruit tasted fresh.  They had a lot of different menu items and choices and they offer condensed milk topping. Definitely interested in trying their other creations but not good for just shaved ice.  Overall I paid almost $7 for a slushy with whipped cream."}
{"text":"Went here and was so impressed. Song has some legit ice and flavors!  I got the taro with strawberry toppings and condensed milk.  The employees are super friendly and welcoming!  Go check them out and enjoy a nice snoh on a Hot day"}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best Boba I have had in years!! My son loved the chocolate shaved ice. The house blend tea is also amazing. Anyone looking for a new treat should try this place. Plus the prices can not be beat!"}
{"text":"I don't make a habit of giving businesses 5-stars if they don't deserve it.  However, in this case, Snoh Ice Shavery deserves every star.  I have made it a tradition of visiting this business every Friday to start the weekend off with a bang.  It is the opposite direction of my house and I usually get stuck in traffic, but it's worth the trouble.  I have been here 3-4 times now and have ordered something different every time.  All of it was good.  I don't know what I'm ordering half the time, but I am always pleasantly surprised by the flavors and quality of ingredients.  Dang it.  I wish I didn't reside in the West Valley.  Just writing this review is making me hungry for more."}
{"text":"I always try something new when I come here and let me just say yum yum yum! It's different but it's so good ;)   The people are friendly and the environment of the place is fun."}
{"text":"Really unique shaved ice... and the most amazing I've ever had! Tastes like ice cream. The condensed milk topping really makes it perfect! My favorites are thai tea with almond cookies or cinnamon toast crunch, topped with condensed milk; or the taro topped with mochi and condensed milk. You've got to check this place out! Wish they were still staying open until 10pm sitll...."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for some sweet treats. I always get the shaved ice and teas, they never disappoint. They have several flavor combinations to offer you, but you can also make your own. Only thing we did not like was the overall cleanliness of this establishment. We've been there about five times, and every time we go the tables are always dirty and sticky. It is very small in there so I can agree with the other helpers who say it can get chaotic in there. A fav tea of ours is the passion fruit tea with raspberry"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best boba and shaved snow places in all of phx! I definitely have to recommend this place for the shaved snow and drinks. It's hard to find stuff this good out in phx. Hopefully they'll open up more of these locales around the valley."}
{"text":"Last weekend I just happened to be in this part of town and after hearing many of my Yelp friends rave about Snoh, I had to give it a try. It was totally not what I expected. I've had snow cones and raspados many times so I thought I knew what to expect from a shaved ice dessert but man I was way off. It was so light and fluffy it is hard to describe it. I think Karen W. said it best when she compared it to frozen cotton candy. Not the taste mind you, just the texture and consistency. I ordered the Thai Tea and the snow by itself was very mild in flavor. But then they let you add all kinds of toppings so I got crushed almond cookies and boba with caramel syrup. They keep everything separate in the bowl rather than mixing it like Cold Stone ice cream because that would ruin the light and fluffy snoh. So, I really liked it that the cookies didn't get soggy and the boba didn't freeze. Each spoonful I tried to get a little bit of each element and I have to say that is a pretty good flavor combination I came up with on my first attempt. It was delicious! The place is small but cute and all the staff seemed friendly. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been before."}
{"text":"Ever since I've tried Snoh for the first time, I crave their mango slush with honey boba quite often. :) Normally, and quite regularly, I go to the downtown location, however tried the camelback location today. Parking at this location is quite a nightmare, as it's right next to a very busy Oreganos and is located on a very busy road, however, the craziness is definitely worth battling for the deliciousness of Snoh! Because I love the mango slush with honey boba so much, I'm yet to try anything else on the menu, however, the menu is extensive and seems to cover just about any sweet craving!"}
{"text":"I've been craving bubble tea since moving to Phoenix. This was a pleasant surprise that satisfied my craving and now a new favorite! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love love this place great treats and love their house milk tea with boba :). One day I'm gonna try the brick toast and the Taro, everything either looks delicious or is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right in front of my best friend's apartment. I love how they're expanding their menu but i still need to try the brick toast. Anyway, i love their taro and black sesame shaved ice top with condensed milk and boba and red bean. Mmmm The best shaved ice ever!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite dessert place! Snoh's shaved ice is like no other in the Phoenix area. It has a light, whipped texture, almost like cotton candy. Also, the ice itself is flavored before it's shaved. When you order at the counter, you get your choice of flavor (e.g., Original, Thai tea, mango, green tea, taro), toppings (1 included for small, 2 included for medium and large), and glaze (e.g., sesame, condensed milk, chocolate, caramel).  So far I've had the mango and the taro, and I prefer the taro. The portions are very generous, and 3-4 people can easily share a large size. There are numerous toppings to choose from (Including fresh fruit, mochi, and puddings). The only thing I wished they had was a fruity glaze, like maybe a strawberry or raspberry.  The decor is hip, and they are always playing a quirky movie on the TV. Iron Sky, anyone?"}
{"text":"I haven't actually tried any of their Snoh desserts but everything looks delish!  I come here solely for a boba tea fix and they do not disappoint.  Their house blend milk tea hits the spot and their boba is cooked perfectly.  If they had a location in Old Town I'd be a daily regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Best passion fruit boba smoothies in the valley.  They are meticulous about the consistency of the boba.  It's perfect every time."}
{"text":"walked in and it felt like I was in some California suburb where a bunch of private schools try and act \"with it\" with their faux gansta clothes.  This is one of those places that embraces yelp so hard that they get 5 stars because they have such an online presence but they actual food itself was very mediocre.  its tasted too sweet and didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome boba milk tea. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here after lunch for a treat! At first I didn't really want to try it. I was only there because my friend insisted we go. She ordered a taro with green tea mochi balls and I have to admit it was delicious! Don't judge a book by its cover!"}
{"text":"The honey dew flavor is so fire. Came here w my friends after we had sushi next door to this place and it's great hang out with all the board/card games!"}
{"text":"Nice environment and great snow ice. Can't find a better one in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First of the snoh here is delicious! My favorite flavors are the Coco Loco and the Gotcha Matcha. This place has a very cool and relaxing vibe. It's a nice place to sit and hang out with friends and enjoy some snoh. The employees are always very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"the staff is very friendly and this is the first boba spot to open in midtown central phoenix the name is very creative the art is very fun this is a wonderful place to bring your family and friends it's a nice place to hang out for a bit. the snoh is very unique and i really enjoy it i come to this place often"}
{"text":"Yum, I am in love with the green tea with condensed milk and mochi balls.  My daughter with the original with chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch (not on the menu).  It is light and refreshing and cools you off on these incredibly hot phoenix days.  I plan on trying one of their teas, eventually, but for now I am content with the shaved ice.  Unique and tasty option in place of ice cream or frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"So I absolutely love this place..love the different flavors love the verity. .it is small and loud though.  I would have totally given it a 5 stars...BUT the last 2 times we have gone in, in less than a month,  everything we wanted they are out of...granted it's a busy place and it's a happen spot but make sure you are very well stocked on the weekends. .."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about Snoh Ice and this is my first time to try it! It was more than spectacular! The shave ice it so yummy and so healthy! I saw so many toppings to pick and very good customer service too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, games available jenga, uno etc.... Being our first time here we had questions, but the girl at the register was not very helpful nor was she friendly. We got a Taro (coconut milk flavor) w/pineapple and condensed milk topping it was ok sorta left an after taste. My friend got the Milk cream (vanilla flavor) w/strawberries and nutella topping...hers was yummy. It would be helpful to offer a sample to first timers....."}
{"text":"Every Asian I know has posted pics of this place...yes in Phoenix Arizona you can find some Asian delishness!  I've tried the green tea and the original flavor but love my strawberry shaved ice! I've stuck with my favorite Strawberry with Chocolate and Coconut Mochi Balls. Not two sweet and just the right amount of sauce and toppings.  All of my friends have gone at least twice, it's an addiction!  The staff has always been friendly.  I've been there during a weekday mid morning and at night, people kept coming in to try Snoh.   Some who know about this type of shaved ice or just curious foodies!"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Drinks/shaved ice: 5/5  Ambience: 5/5   I'm from New York and after doing some yelping, I found this place not too far from where I'm staying at.   When I walked in, I was captivated by the comics to the right. As I walked right in, a friendly girl welcomed me and was very accommodating when I wanted to switch my drink.   I ordered the gotcha matcha and mangonada.  I felt that the Matcha from Gotcha Matcha didn't have enough matcha flavors, but it was still delicious. The red bean and mochi that came with the order tasted standard and similar to the NY places.   At first I also ordered a Pomegranate ice tea with honey boba but after waiting for my ice and drink, I saw their advertised Mangonada on the TV off the menu. I guess it was new but it got my attention. I went to ask the girl if I could change my drink since she hasn't made it yet. She was very accommodating and super friendly about it!   I will definitely be coming back if I ever visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Holy balls this place was good.  I got the Thai tea flavor with boba, shaved coconut, condensed milk and black sesame seeds.  It was decadent, creamy,fluffy and not too sweet.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Snoh by a coworker and have been back numerous times since. There was even a time where I went two weekends in a row. I don't even live close to Snoh but I'll make the trip out there any day.  No, Snoh is not a snow cone place. The best way to describe the texture is to compare it to fresh fluffy snow... or if you've ever ice skated before and used to make a pile of snow with your blades, it's a lot like that. The flavor is mixed in to the ice and isn't a syrup that they put on top. It's super light and refreshing. It's a great treat to have in the day to cool down or perfect for dessert after a meal.  I've tried their taro, strawberry, mango, honeydew, red velvet, and black sesame flavors. My favorites are mango and red velvet. With the mango (my usual go-to), I usually get lychee jelly and light condensed milk on it. The red velvet was a seasonal flavor but also one of my favorites. It was so good with the chocolate sauce. I wish they'd bring it back!  I've also tried their lychee bubble tea with lychee jelly in it. I haven't found a place in the Valley with good bubble tea until Snoh opened. It's so hard to decide whether or not I want Snoh or their bubble tea when I go in though.  If you go frequently, ask for their punch card!"}
{"text":"Updaaate! My last review of Snoh's was based on my first taste of this awesome Taiwanese dessert. Since then, I've been out there, I've seen things, I've lived...What I really mean is that I've tried other places in both Arizona and California alike which also serve boba and this delicious shaved ice concoction. Though they all have things that I like and dislike, Snoh Ice Shavery ultimately prevailed.  Price-wise, they're all pretty much on par. I honestly feel like you get more snoh at Snoh's because most other places will serve you your dessert on a plate, whereas Snoh's will pack it down into a cup for you. So it may seem like you're getting more on a plate at these other places, but really, it's fluff. Plus, of the places I've been to, Snoh's is way more generous with their toppings which I really appreciate since I think the different toppings really add different textures and flavors to your dessert. I love Snoh's variety of flavors and toppings, and they always manage to keep things fresh by coming up with seasonal toppings or flavors which are handwritten on a little whiteboard next to the register. (I personally am waiting for them to bring in red bean snoh, which I've seen at other places but have yet to see at Snoh's.) Their decor is pretty awesome, with their walls covered in pop culture themed artworks and two flat screens playing some sitcom or movie from the '80s or '90s. It's definitely a spot to hang out at, with games from your childhood, scattered at the various tables. The crowds come in waves so I don't really have any recommendations on the best time to check this place out, but if you're in the mood for some shaved ice this Summer (or anytime, really), definitely give Snoh's a shot!"}
{"text":"Refreshing desserts you can't find anywhere else in Phoenix. Fun place to hang out and even get some work done. Almond pudding = almond jello!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Snoh in Phoenix!  The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  My favorite flavor is honeydew!  I tried the dairy free pistachio tonight and it was fantastic!  Loving the new combo menu too!  Keep up the good work!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Such a sweet treat on a hot summer day! I love the snoh here! I'm a fan of the taro, green tea, and black sesame with mochi, almond jello, and condensed milk. Any of these choices in any combination. The presentation makes it that much more tasty!"}
{"text":"I was in this area last night and stopped here for the first time.  It was a bit chaotic, screaming kids and loud teenagers.  I walked up to the counter to check out the menu, handed my sister 20 bucks and told her to get me the usual thai tea with boba. There was one girl taking orders while another girl was calling peoples names repeatedly, I guess the customers couldn't hear her over the screams of the kids. So, I walked back towards the exit, and found a table that was empty, it was dirty with crumbs all over it, whatever I thought, just get my drink and leave was the plan. The tea was alright, there was too much boba in it. I was trying to drink all the tea while leaving the excess of boba in the cup...not easy.  As I was leaving the parking lot I tried to go out the south on to Camelback...well some idiot blocked the exit. So annoying!  Would I go back to this place? No. Was the tea good? Eh. Not terrible.  I'll have to try the downtown location next, since it is closer to me."}
{"text":"It tasted a lot better than I thought it would. In fact, it was the best shaved snow I had here in the Phoenix area, so far.  I love coconut, so I got the coconut shaved ice, added coconut shavings and custard pudding. I regret I didn't get the Large for myself... I got the smallest size :( SO DELICIOUS and I constantly crave it... it's too bad this place is 40 minutes from where I live... otherwise I would be going there multiple times a week!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! They only have the one location right now but there is one opening up in downtown Phoenix but one in Tempe would be awesome! I love going here for some sweet treats!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is by far my favorite dessert spot! I come here at least once a week. I've tried a lot of stuff from their menu. Different varieties of snohs. But honestly I think my all time favorite is the Thai tea snoh. At first this shaved ice leaves you a little confused is it shaved ice? Is it ice cream? NO ONE KNOWS! Lol the texture is super crazy. Also I am super picky when it come to boba and they cook theirs to perfection not too soggy not to hard just right!  I highly suggest their Vietnamese coffee with boba splendid!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The shave ice+ toppings combo is amazing. A great selection of flavors, toppings and glazes. We tried strawberry with mochi balls, mango pudding and condensed milk. I love that the shave ice isnt overly sweet. Fun interior, clean, friendly service... Will return to try more flavors and the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"****Environment: The place is nicely decorated. I really like the artsy look with comics, paintings, drawings and portraits along side the way. It definitely gives me that modern, urban feel. The seats and tables are well spaced and there is a cool are to play board games, cards, checkers, etc. The bathroom was out of order at the time which is understandable and not their fault.  ***Food: Snoh, I would describe is a healthier alternative from eating ice cream. That's how I would put it at least. I feel if one is wanting their sweet tooth craved, but not wanting to guilty calories and sugar, this would be the place for it. It's almost like you're eating air/clouds with flavor. Literally the ice is shaved so thin and fluffy that it feels like nothing is in your mouth. The only thing I feel though was that the flavor was not enough. I'm not really a sweet tooth kind of guy but seriously, I felt there could be a bit or flavor. Even with the toppings I still felt like the Pistachio Snoh Combo cup was lacking flavor. I understand I'm trying to eat healthy but if they were to add a little more flavor to the ice, it would definitely boost my rating up. I felt the only flavor I was enjoying was the toppings.  **Service: I felt like the service was a little on the down side. I didn't feel welcomed by the cashier. It was more a feeling like that person didn't want to be there. I'm not sure if it was just a bad/raining day causing that type of mood, but I just wanted to order my stuff and get out.   Overall, if you really are looking to be healthy and craving sweets without that guilty conscious, you might be able to fulfill it here. However if you sweet tooth is more intense, you definitely will be disappointed and look like a sad panda!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! And the staff is fantastic!!! Boba tea & SNOH! Recommend the Thai tea flavor in both!"}
{"text":"Why wouldn't I rate 5 stars at snoh? Cause it's amazing that's why! Original, and fun and a quirky place for your frozen desserts and  refreshing teas! If you don't love Thai tea your missing out and this is the spot to be and get it. Interior is wondering when you walk in, it's like you walked into a mini comi-con all sorts of people from different waves come into here. Specially located in midtown on camelback! When I come in I'm never disappointed, they do need to have sizes for the brick toast but I mean I'm not complaining just for people who can't finish it all. My favorite is the thai-chew which is the #12 if you can't make up your mind or don't know what to do with your custom order! Love love love the black sesame sauce it's my favorite and I think goes well with almost anything? They also do daily specials here which is my favorite, cause I like a good deal! Definitely come in, specially if you are feeling this heat, but don't feel the heat too much! Stay hungry and cool Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. To be honest i wouldnt be back. I had high expectations and seeing so many great reviews i was excited to try this place. I was extremely let down.. Being that its my first time i wasnt able to try the flavors. This sucked because i would have loved to try one of their cool flavors before i got it rather than just paying for something i may not like..  To start, i ordered 2 #10's with marshmellow to add on both. I didnt get very many strawberries, and seeing others get a lot turned me off..  The oreos, which i had A TON of were just stale. They tasted as if they had been sitting out or expired. I ended up scooping out all the oreos because it was just gross.  The marshmellows that i had added were the highlight of it, even though it was just a regular marshmellow.  I asked for nutella and got chocolate sauce. Figures. As far as the \"snoh\" goes, its alright. The strawberry snoh does not really taste like anything. Kinda hard to like or dislike something if it doesnt really have too much flavor.  We ended up throwing away our snoh not even finishing it. The games were disgusting and havent been wiped down for ages it looks like. For the price i could have went to another place and had a better experience. $14 is ridiculous to pay for \"snoh\" if im barely getting toppings, the place is dirty and i dont even get the right toppings. As far as my friends snoh, they didnt enjoy it either. They wont be back, and sadly neither will i. To each their own.  Sadly yelp failed me on this one."}
{"text":"I stop by once a week to pick up drinks for work. I usually get their Vietnamese coffee and lychee tea with lychee jelly. The coffee has the right amount of espresso for my long night shift. They pretty much know my order. Because I buy a lot of drinks the cup holders are very important and I prefer the cardboard holder with the handles and the new bags they have now. I had some issues spilling my drinks all over the place. I have presented my issues. Overall, I love the shaved ice and the drinks here! It's a chill place to hang out too. My friends at work love this place too and I get requests to bring in drinks all the time"}
{"text":"The texture and softness of snoh is to die for! It's light weight almost like you're not eating any calories! The place is small but clean. I recommend the pistachio snoh."}
{"text":"We just tried to order online and it was too late so the system booted us off and when we drove in we hit every single red light, it was terrible. Got there 1 minute before close and they were nice enough to still serve us. It was really tasty too, such a great first time. Thank you"}
{"text":"The worst part about this place is deciding what to have.    The shop itself is funky and artsy and hip.  The menu is fun and unique.  If you want a shaved ice, you can choose to order pre- designed ingredients, like the breakfast bowl snoh or go rogue and mix and match what you want.  I chose the latter and had mango shaved ice with pineapple chunks and caramel drizzled.  But also had to try the breakfast bowl Snoh too.  Who can resist fruity pebbles?   Both were extremely delicious and refreshing too.  The employee was very knowledgeable and patient while I figured out what I wanted."}
{"text":"Very clean. Fast service. Sign up for updates and you get an additional topping (saves you about $0.50).  I didn't ask if there were a military discount, I will next time.  Lots of really cool new age, hip art pieces on one side of the wall. Lots to look at and talk about.  I ordered a small \"snoh\" shaved iced that came around $5 and some change AFTER taxes.  You get to choose one snoh ice. One topping (additional topping is $0.50 each) and one sauce. I think they should do two sauces. Every one after that, charge.  It's pretty pricey. The location isn't in the best of places. But it's right beside a small Asian market, a salon, vape shop, and Asian restaurant. So I guess it'll attract the curious passerby's.  5 stars because there isn't anything wrong besides minor things like the look of the plaza it's in and it's pricey. Other than that, I like it."}
{"text":"Awesome place ! Been there a couple times , never disappointed , clean place and friendly service . I took my family last weekend and it was their first time trying snoh and they loved it ."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying THIS IS NOT TRADITIONAL SHAVED ICE  This is Taiwanese shaved ice which means it has a different texture and unlike traditional shaved ice it is already flavored when you pick it out.  The service was excellent, the cashier explained everything tip us and even allowed me to sample 2 flavors. I ended up ordering a coconut flavored ice with mango and condensed milk.  Wasn't really my thing, I actually ended up tossing it out upon leaving but overall if this is your thing, give them a try.  I saw 4 people come in after me and order thai teas and other flavored teas so if I'm ever in the area again I'll be sure to give one of those a shot instead of the actual shaved ice."}
{"text":"A taste of home! I am definitely California grown and needed my shaved SNOW.  It's not the same as shaved ice.. not big pieces but little snow pieces that melt in your mouth.  They had the best green tea snow I have ever had.  One of the workers told me they will have brick toast soon.  I warn you native Arizonans... brick toast is AMAZING! Will be back for more snow, brick toast, and boba tea"}
{"text":"I've been here since it's opened a few years ago. The concept is so unique and the owner, Tone is so great. He does a great job marketing his business and support locals. I have pretty much tried everything there is on this menu and I don't even know where to start.   My go to snoh would have to be a taro snoh, almond cookies, with condensed milk. The almond cookie combination with taro and condensed milk Is so good. RELISH EVERY BITE.  My go to drink here would have to be the Thai tea boba with condensed milk.  If you were wondering, the brick toast is great too. I love the ice cream with the brick toast. Actually, everything here is good. I really don't have any complaints.   My only thing is that the staff members could be a little bit more helpful with new customers since they are new to the concept of snoh."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend who had tried to come here before it was open. Of course I had to beat her there and try it first because I'm selfish like that ;)  It was REALLY GOOD! I had the Thai tea with strawberries and condensed milk glaze. Great combo, and I'm excited to try the other combinations they have as well! The shaved ice isnt like traditional crappy american shaved iced that you get at fairs and kids birthday parties, it's creamy. Probably closer to an ice cream, but def lighter than an ice cream. You know, I'm not explaining this very well... You should just go in and try it, you won't regret it. :)  The store is really nice inside, great branding, love the logo (I'm a graphic designer, can you tell?)... Also, everyone was very nice and helpful.   There are also free stickers, so that's good. Definitely try this place out! Ill be going back, especially since I live right next to it (score!)."}
{"text":"I tried to go here on a Saturday around 7pm, 4 hours before closing time they state on their website and store. They had closed the shop with no explanation on the door."}
{"text":"I used to think snow wasn't as good as boba, then I visited Snoh during the Matsuri festival.   Mango boba snow with condensed milk was almost airy in texture and was something I've never had before - price is a bit steep but highly recommended if your looking for something then your boba fix"}
{"text":"What I love about this place goes beyond the product, it's the people behind it. Tony is doing great things in Phoenix by collaborating with other like-minded individuals around the city. The art that's shown on the walls by uber talented local artists near and far. Our very own, Phx Night Market that just took place. And the fact that he supports his fellow employees to pursue their own visions in business adventures is amazing. I love the heart behind Snoh.   And of course, the drinks are refreshing, innovative, and tasty."}
{"text":"I had the taro with sesame sauce and almond cookie. I don't know what taro is but I chose it because it looks so pretty (it's purple) it's really good and has a nutty taste to it. The sesame sauce is sooo good, it also has a nutty taste. My husband tried the orange sno  (can't remember flavor) with Nutella and he did not enjoy his flavor at all. It's amazing how you can actually see the tiny snowflakes on the shaved ice, it's so smooth. Not quite as creamy ice cream but creamier than  shaved ice. The mochi balls were just not for me, they tasted like rice based gummy, not very flavorful.  The cashier was not friendly at all. We were there at 11:55 and the doors were wide open so we walked in but no one was at the register. We stood there for a good five minutes even though we could see the employee. He just ignored us until it turned exactly 12:00. I didn't even notice the opening time until this buzzer rang, then without a hello or eye contact he took our order and payment. I live far from here so I'll probably be back if I'm near the area and craving the sesame black sauce."}
{"text":"I was craving Ube Ice Cream (If you haven't tried some, definitely do!), so one day I yelped where I could get some. This place came up and it instantly intrigued me.   My husband and I finally went on Valentine's Day. The parking lot was crowded, but luckily it didn't take us long to find a place to park. Walking in we noticed that there were board games for customers to play while they enjoyed their treats. We love board games, so it was great to see that! My husband and I both shared a custom order with Ube Snoh and graham crackers. We didn't really do anything special because we mostly just wanted Ube. Hands down, it was delicious. It's like eating actual snow, but flavorful! Honestly, you're just going to have to visit this place to actually understand what its like to eat it. I'm really excited to come back because there no where else in the valley that does Snoh better!"}
{"text":"Yo this place is off the chaiinnnnnnn ! The ice cream shaved ice whatever these prophets are calling it is amazing."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and I had just moved to Phoenix about three weeks ago from Orlando. That is where I was first introduced to shaved snow. The place differs in the things they offer but the idea is the same. Shaved ice that is flavored. I got the taro snow but if you get a small only one topping comes with it. The place in Orlando had unlimited toppings. The taro snow was good, sweeter than I'm used to and I added coconut flakes. I thought it was toasted flakes but it was just shredded coconut, fleshy and moist. Nonetheless it is a great dessert option. I may just bring a Baggie of toasted coconut to fulfill my craving. It just gives it some texture.   My friends got the honeydew which they really kept saying how great it was. That is definitely the flavor I will try next. They also have boba too which I have yet to try.   I like the ambiance of the store and they people in there were really friendly. They also have games like Jenga. So it's a fun place to just lounge with your friends.  They have a loyalty program so get one of those cards if you find yourself coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and brother who are in from out of town, to grab some boba to beat the heat and partially to show them one of the only places that has boba in Phoenix (haha!)  I got the Almond Milk Tea with pudding, my brother got the House Milk Tea with boba and my mom got the Honeydew with boba. We sat down and played a few games available in the corner of the shop and had our drinks before going on our way. The Almond Milk Tea was good, definitely not as sweet as the Honeydew I had last time that was way too sweet. The pudding was just alright. I don't feel that their boba is sweetened, but more often than not the boba is cooked well. I honestly think that the best drinks here so far has got to be their flavored Green Teas, House Milk Tea and their Almond Milk Tea! The drinks are one size I believe!  The service is pretty fast considering it's never too crowded all the times I've visited. Great place to hang out with a friend or to stop in to satisfy your boba cravings."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night with the husband and my littlest to get a post dinner treat.  First off, parking is a nightmare here on Friday nights with all of the surrounding eateries competing for the limited spaces.  I witnessed a near fist fight as some little buttwad driving a Fiat raced into a parking space that was about to be occupied by a middle aged father with his family in the car.  (The dad showed great restraint in not decking the young punk who cut him off.)    Finally my husband found us a parking space in the rear and we walked around and went inside.  The store is small but super cute with very attractive artwork hanging from the walls (and offered for sale) and light alternative music playing overhead.   We were newbies to this kind of treat so we each modestly chose a small sized, original flavor milk ice.  I had chopped strawberries and caramel glazed over the one I shared with my little, and my husband got one with sliced almonds and no glaze.  Our total was a modest $8 and the very friendly cashier offered me a punch card for future visits.   We sat at an inside table to eat and we loved our treats; they were light and sweet but not too heavy or dense.  It really was shaved ice.  I'm intrigued at the different flavors like taro and green tea and the toppings like lychee fruit, rice pudding and mochi balls, and they also had a photo of something called a brick toast, which looked pretty tasty...I'll definitely be back here at another time to check out some of the other offerings and toppings.    I'm glad I finally got over to this place to check it out!"}
{"text":"I am so happy the snow craze has finally made it to Arizona! I have had snow at a couple places in California, so when this opened we knew it was a must try! I knew it would be successful in Phoenix, well...because it get so damn hot! We came here opening week and got there at the perfect time because after we got our order the line got crazy and went out the door! I recommend everything! my favorite is mango, taro  flavored snow with the mango popper thingys! We even tried to black sesame syrup, that i'll admit I doubted, but it was really good! This is close to my sisters house so I hope to come back again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite boba tea in the entire Phoenix metropolitan valley. I go in every once in a while when in the area. I wish there was a Snoh closer to our house! The staff is always friendly and kind. I love having Snoh in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"****** Same day update since Yelp won't let me write a separate one on the same day ******  I've never been too prideful to admit that I've made a bone-headed move.  In my initial review of this place, I irresponsibly wrote that that they use \"artificial flavors\" in their shaved ice without knowing for sure and just throwing it out there based on assumption. I've since amended that to just \"flavor.\"  This was brought to my attention by the owner who, despite having every right to rip me a new one, sent me a very polite message regarding my initial review, informing me they do not use artificial flavors and inviting to check out their kitchen next time I stop by, which i will, and also suggest you do.  This does nothing to change my review at this time.  The taste is what it is to me, and my reviews are mostly taste-based, though I did very much appreciate the message from the owner.  This is mainly a public mea culpa, plus some additional information for you to consider.  ****** Original review ******    Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Don't get me wrong, I'm really, really glad that a Taiwanese-style shaved ice place is here in Phoenix.  It's the best there is here in the Valley and you should go.  But coming from Southern California, where there is ample delicious shaved ice, I have to rank this guy somewhere in the middle of the road.    My biggest knock on this place is the flavor.  The flavoring they use has a really distinct chemically taste and aftertaste.  It's not so off-putting that I wouldn't go back, but it does bump this place down a couple notches.  That being said, the texture of the ice is perfectly fine, and I like the variety that they have.    Always add the condensed milk.  It's one of the best parts of Taiwanese shaved ice."}
{"text":"My favorite place for BoBa, every drink I try is my new favorite :) the milk teas and the slushees are best... I have become a SNOH junkie!!!"}
{"text":"This place has very lively wall art and decorations. I have been here during the day and night and it's always great. This time we had green tea/almond pudding/condensed milk and taro/custard pudding/red bean/condensed milk. Very good medley of flavors and smooth snow ice. Highly recommended even if you don't live nearby."}
{"text":"I was in AZ for a family gathering and passed by this place. I was interested because it said 'Snoh'. I immediately pictured Taiwanese shaved ice in my head. Gave it a try and little did I know, it tasted better than I had expected. :)  We went there during their grand opening on Saturday around 11-11:30am. They had Lion Dancer's and DJ set up. That was pretty cool, the lion dancers made two performaces. The line was out the door after 5-10 minutes of opening. I was amazed! I have never seen a dessert place this packed. My initial reaction when I walked in was wow! WOW this place looks amazing and has very very nice decor (wish this store was in CA). It looks very upscale compare to some stores and restaurants in AZ. It had a nice ambiance and a variety of different crowds.  I didn't even feel like I was in AZ... It was kind of upscale and hipster-ish at the same time. They have this very cool canvas poster on the wall with customers holding snoh stickers. They also had another wall with cool photos! The owners remind me of young, hip, and trendy people. It's awesome inside.  Their staff is very friendly and helpful. There was quite a few employees that day and  I assume they were family and friends. The girl at the front desk was helpful and made some recommendations. She recommended I try the black sesame glaze (I FELL IN LOVE)..   I ordered a few different ones to try. I had Taro Snoh (purple) with Coconut Mochi balls with Black Sesame glazing. OMG it was so good. The Snoh literally melted in my mouth. Next I had the Thai Tea with Boba and condensed milk. I should have ordered a large for my self. I couldn't get enough... It is SOOOOOOO goood!!!!!! They also sell drinks. Their Thai Tea with Boba was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! It's rich and creamy. It definitely hit the spot for me. Not to mention their boba was super super super soft... (I heard some other customers say that there are no good boba places in AZ, i guess this is the place to go....For a second I thought I was in CA. This store definitely has authenticity when it comes to their recipes. You might also want to try their Almond Milk Tea with boba of course ... They also offer other milk tea drinks: Taro and House blend also some peach strawberry and passion fruit tea.   They also have freee wifi!!!! Ain't that awesome??? All you have to do is ask for the password.. I LOVE this place. I can't wait to go back. I am sure this place will do well with those scorching and burning weathers during the summer!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The shaved ice is so... Fluffy. Taro is my fav, but Thai tea is also good. The boba is nice and tender. Not overly chewey or hard. Hip atmosphere. There are some board games there. Good place to hang out. Neat artwork."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I've never had shaved ice like this- it's weightless! Had a very long work day and stopped in here for a wifi break with some colleagues. Got the coconut flavor with some pecans and chocolate. This would be a really good place for people who didn't want something so heavy- I did not feel overly full. The place had really nice music and it was a good spot to relax and work for a while with a treat. Boba looks yummy too :)"}
{"text":"I remember trying Snoh once at the CNY festival. It was a much better alternative to the Hawaiian Shaved Ice in my opinion. Today, I finally had a chance to visit their shop. Upon entrance, I was happy to see a bunch of seating and other folks enjoying their frozen treat.   I had the Gotcha Matcha w/ red bean, mochi, and condensed milk. The green tea ice was strong - but I like it that way. I really dislike it when places deem something as matcha, but in reality the only thing that makes it matcha is it's color. I was impressed with the flavor and that alone is worth coming back for. The mochi was soft and chewy (QQ). The red bean was good.? All in all, a beautiful blend of flavors.   They had a bunch of other things to choose from - and different sized cups. They also offered boba drinks and custom bowls.   I can definitely see myself frequenting Snoh over the summer!"}
{"text":"We enjoy taking our kids here.  Very casual atmosphere service is always good and there are almost limitless choices. The food is reliably tasty. We highly recommend SNOH!"}
{"text":"I first heard of this place from my sister. It's literally 2 blocks from where I live, yet I never really noticed it (Oregano's is on the other side). I'm not a fan of shaved ice, but my sister told me it's different and it's quite delicious, plus they sell boba tea so that kind of sold me. I'm a big fan of milk tea with boba, but no one in Phoenix really sell it - usually you won't find it unless you're in Tempe or Chandler.  Anyways, I went there twice, Saturday and Sunday. The first time I got the green tea ice with red bean, boba, and condensed milk. It was delicious. Fluffy, refreshing, and smooth. I didn't really taste much of the green tea, but it was delicious regardless especially since it was 110 degrees outside.  Sunday, I got an almond boba tea and another snoh ice. I got taro this time with the same toppings. The taro was yummy. Definitely taste like taro.   I will definitely come back. It's conveniently located and the place is clean and nice. There's wifi so you can work there and enjoy a snoh ice if you want. It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"***UPDATE*** Tony from Snoh decided to reply to my review, kindly apologizing for them not having the coffee when I ordered it.  Unfortunately, he completely ignored the issues listed in my review: *Was not told they were out until my credit card was already processed.  *No apology from the cashier for being out.  *Complete indifference from the cashier in regards to my disappointment.  *Long wait time for a simple small Snoh.  *Observations of staff more worried about being on their phones than taking care of customers.  Glad they actually respond to the reviews. Sad they don't actually read them.  ------------------------------------------------  Delicious (and reasonably priced dessert). I went with the Milk Cream Snoh with Marshmallows and Condensed Milk. Awesome! My criticism is that I ordered a Vietnamese Coffee and wasn't told they were out until AFTER running my credit card. And the way I was told was less than ideal, \"we are out of coffee, do you want something else?\", \"no, I had my heart set on the coffee.\", \"do you still want the Snoh?\", \"yes.\", \"ok, your new total is $4.35\"... Maybe I'm expecting too much, but shouldn't there have been an apology in there somewhere? Especially when you are out of an item less than 2 hours after opening? You'd also think my very simple order of Snoh would take less than 5 minutes. At least do the 2 teenagers working the counter get back to their (fascinating, I'm sure) Instagram and texting.  Good product, poor service. Rant over."}
{"text":"This place is usually great. But today we came in with our Snoh jars and practically ended up paying for jars full of ice. Our drinks were completely watered down because of it. My husband also ordered a Mango Tango, but they had no mango  They also didn't have strawberries, so he settled for canned pineapple  Also, seemed like no one was attending to the seating area since every single table was dirty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! So glad I finally found the local boba spot. The location is perfect (right on Camelback), the staff is friendly, and the boba is just how it should be. Still have yet to try the shaved ice. This place would get 5 stars if they had my beloved green tea.  Overall, best (and only) spot to go for boba in central PHX."}
{"text":"Novel dessert + fun spot  I used to eat bao bing as a kid in Taiwan. Snoh makes a variety of desserts with a spin on that, all of which are uber yum. They also sell bubble teas, but we were focused on the Snoh cups this time.   Combos the fam and I had: Gotcha Matcha (green tea), Purple Fusion (taro), and Smorrissey (smores). First, the ice is actually light and fluffy, so don't expect something super dense. Next, the toppings really make the combo. The folks at Snoh seems to base around a strong flavor theme, coupled with sweetness and something chewy/jelly. It works. Oh, sweet child of mine, it works!  We'll be back to try the teas and other treats on the menu. Prices are reasonable at less than $10 per person and the service crew was cool.   One suggestion: they need a larger parking lot. There are a number of businesses around Snoh and the place is made for people to lounge. It can be hard to park and find a place to relax.   Last thought: These folks are onto something special. It may be the next dessert craze in a crowded market looking for the fun and inspired. And for Phoenix, ice-based desserts are an inspired treat on our hell-hot days."}
{"text":"This is the best shaved ice experience in the valley. If you are looking for authentic favors like matcha and Thai tea, they have it. The kiddos will enjoy choices like cotton candy and strawberry. The ice here is so fine and light, it takes snoh to another level! I opted for the #4 Gotcha Matcha - green tea ice, red bean topping and instead of condensed milk I chose the black sesame glaze. Yum!!!! The customer service is awesome and helpful, too. Great peeps, cool atmosphere, relaxed vibe. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super yummy frosty treats for the milk intolerant, like me! The mango with coconut was amazing and the thai tea with boba was cool and refreshing. Neither the  sno nor the tea were overly sweet. The staff was very friendly and the artwork adorning the walls was fun and funky.  I'm definitely coming back and trying something new!"}
{"text":"I really like heir smoothies. Their boba isn't so good it's a really good environment . They have board games to okay and chill with your friends and family etc"}
{"text":"It's nice to have places like this in the valley but wasn't as good as I expected. They were out of few toppings I wanted and the flavor was very bland."}
{"text":"Thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba. Perfection. I love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice. I want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it. Be bold. Get red bean or taro. Avoid the boring strawberry."}
{"text":"I've visited 10+ times.  The texture and flavor of the snow and drinks are consistently good.  I like the green tea and taro snow and also almond milk tea, thai iced tea, and vietnamese coffee.  Workers are sometimes nice, and sometimes not as nice/friendly...."}
{"text":"Love it! My daughter and I came here to have a cool treat. Snoh has a great atmosphere and their staff is very helpful. We ordered a small mango Snoh with mochi, boba, and ropes with condensed milk. I also ordered a honey dew milk tea with boba. I love this! Next time I would order with Lychee jelly I think. The only negative is that it's too far from my house (maybe that's a positive actually)."}
{"text":"My cotton candy Snoh wassassss sooooo good!! I love it , wish I had one right now!! Highly recommend .They were nice and friendly and hardworking individuals serving with a smile!! You gotta try this stuff"}
{"text":"If Heaven doesn't have Snoh then it is no place for me.  The staff are friendly and are helpful to new customers when picking out a flavor. The decor is really interesting and gives to the unique atmosphere and vibe. I love they display local art.   I get the taro flavor with condensed milk and mochi balls. It is like angels are in your mouth. My friends were talking as I was eating Snoh and I paid no mins. No conversation was important enough to distract me from the taste.   \"Hey, Britt..... I need to share my innermost thoughts about a very intense topiic that may change my life..\"- Friend  *evil glare*** \"No....\"   *shoves Snoh in mouth***"}
{"text":"Holy SNOH! This s%&$ is fan-freaking-tastic!! I have to say, this Canadian walking into Snoh really didn't get what it was all about, I've just never seen or heard of anything like it. I asked the owner and staff, as I was trying to decide what to have, exactly what I was about to eat - \"Is it like Hawaiian shaved ice\" I asked? He replied that no, it was very different: milk based, very light and fluffy. In my head I really could not conceive light and fluffy ice... Man oh man is it ever! I was addicted after one bite! Super full from lunch I just wanted a sample to try - let's just say I downed the entire thing. People, I just couldn't stop myself!! I had the traditional flavour (yes, yes, there is a 'u' in flavour in Canada) with a caramel drizzle and almond cookies crushed on the top. 100% unique and absolutely fabulous!   Cheers Snoh, I will be sending the Snow Birds your way!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place based on the reviews and recommendations. The employee who took our order was indifferent in terms of friendliness and customer service. The other employees were unfriendly and acted as if they didn't want to be there. The owner was rude and unfriendly. I was not impressed with the food. The Snoh didn't seem to have much flavor and the toppings did not taste/look fresh. The bathroom was dirty. There was no toilet paper, no soap, and the hand dryer was not working. It also isn't in the best part of town and there isn't much parking. There are several other businesses that share the same parking lot and we got the last parking spot. Overall a disappointment, we will not return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new ways to beat the heat: Taiwanese ice cream! Actually it's shaved ice with a very unique texture. Also, it's a great place to get bubble tea too!  So far we have had our Snoh's in strawberry, taro and green tea. Most recently, I tried green tea + red beans + condensed milk='s delicious! With the red beans, I felt like I was back in the Philippines.   Not to mention that it's a pretty \"healthy\" dessert. 100 calories!"}
{"text":"I heard John Snoh (for you Game of Thrones fans) was in town, at this place, so I came to see him, but oh boy, did I get it wrong!  Location & Aesthetics - located in on E Camelback Road with no trouble spotting the business with their large outdoor sign. Parking was iffy as I found their parking lot to be on the small side as the parking is shared with other businesses within the same compound (-0.5). Interior decor was interesting as it was decorated with anime, Star Wars, and a mishmash of other posters/pictures.  They even had a flat screen TV that was playing anime.  I suddenly asked myself, \"Was I too old to be in this place?\"  I felt as if I wandered back to my teenage years when I collected and traded Pokemon cards.  Patrons were even playing board games on the tables which I've never seen being allowed before at a business....interesting concept.  After all, the place does look hip (does anyone say that anymore....now I'm starting to feel old....I digress!) Seating is limited inside and outside as the place is small in my opinion.  As you enter, there's seating on the left and right - large tables with chairs and smaller tables with chairs, and one small bench outside that could probably seat 2-3 (-0.5).  When we arrived, practically all the tables were occupied, even the larger tables with chairs had only 2 patrons. Thankfully we snagged a table, while waiting for our orders, as some folks were leaving.  Menus - posted on a board above the cashier, and it was overwhelming so I suggest you take a good gander before ordering.  I say this because when it came time to place my order, I got it wrong.        Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  They answered our questions about the menu, and even that little faux pas I made with my order, was corrected nicely and friendly by them.  Food - For me, I had the build your own snoh - medium with two toppings (this is where I got it wrong as I thought it was 2 flavors but it's 2 toppings) + plus glaze.  I had the strawberry + 2 toppings of strawberries and custard pudding + glaze of condensed milk drizzled on top. The strawberries was fresh and sweet (no tartness); the custard pudding didn't look runny but held up on its own; the condensed milk was fresh as well and insanely sweet (it's supposed to be so no complaints there) but what I liked was that is was drizzled on top of the whole creation, not poured.  I have been used to it being doused on top until it's running over the cup which I think is overkill. The snoh I left for last to comment on.  When I came here for shaved ice, I was expecting  chipped crunchy ice as I am used to and not a a fluffy snow type of shaved ice.  When I had shaved ice in the Islands, it was the former - chipped crunchy ice, drizzled with guava syrup and then drizzled with the optional condensed milk and that was it.  For me, it was interesting to try this and my first impression is that I love it.  I like the fact that it isn't super sweet, like frozen yogurt, but it's lighter and fluffier, almost like cotton candy...I guess I could go on and on with the similes as I write this.  I've never had anything like this before and I definitely do like it.  I like the menu items and the insane permutations and combinations that one can utilize to create one of these things.  They also have combo cups and even creations on large dinner sized plates where, let's say, a family can dug into from the center of the table, and I think on my next return I'd certainly like to try one of those.  Most definitely do recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"I got the breakfast bowl and it was such a treat! It really tingles your senses. Also the pistachio bowl is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Snoh is a refreshing & delicious alternative to regular shaved ice &/or ice cream. Their thai tea boba is also delish. Have never had a bad experience here. & did I mention all the fun games they have?! & awesome art?? My fav Snoh is strawberry snoh with nutella & oreo. Nomnom  P.S. Tone is a kewl dude."}
{"text":"This place is great! The consistency is unique and for lack of better terms, is just like snow!  You pick a base snow flavor, a sauce to put on top and another topping. I got the milk cream snoh, with Oreos, and condensed milk. Yum."}
{"text":"I love boba tea! The pistachio milk tea is the best drink ever. Their Taro milk tea is awesome as well. I've even tried their Thai almond milk tea & I was not so much impressed with the flavor. I couldn't taste the Thai tea in that drink at all. I love that you can adjust the sweetness to the drinks. I love the vibe of this place. great music. All the art decor on the walls. They even let you write on their glass on the counter with dry erase markers!  The other day, I got my girlfriend a pistachio slush with boba. unfortunately they had ran out of boba & the wait for more boba was 30 mins so I had to go without. Because of the fact that I thought the pistachio milk tea was awesome, the slush , ehhh not so much. It tasted really watered down.   Their bathroom was out of order as well, so that was fantastic. The reason why I give this place 3 stars is because I'm paying $5 for a glass of ice with a splash of flavoring haha. Even when I ask for easy ice, which I literally do every single time, there's still so much ice! Sometimes they don't even follow my request for easy ice. I can see them making the drink, clearly. My last visit, The girl who was making my drink saw that Light ice was written on the cup when she was finished. she took out like 6 ice cubes and filled the rest of the cup with water I'm guessing? Go figure, I asked this drink to have half the sweetness & you guessed it. I got a cup of watered down milk tea.   This place was my favorite & now I'm not sure because it seems like more of the bad is outweighing the good about this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My friend took a group of us here last month and I have been hooked ever since.  My favorite so far is taro with condensed milk."}
{"text":"After visiting a next door restaurant many times I was finally convinced to try Snoh. I don't know why I waited so long! This place is delicious yumminess.   I got the Thai tea snoh because I love Thai tea and I was happy with my choice. I topped it with some gummy something that I can't remember the name but it wasnt boba and some condensed milk.  Sooooo delicious.  I really enjoyed the lightness of the snoh dessert and the Thai tea was not overly sweet.  If you enjoy a sweet variety their mango flavor would satisfy. Definitely check out this place for a refreshingly different end to any meal."}
{"text":"Snoh has an interesting product. It's very mild and subtle. Now that I've been there twice and watched the guys crank out their desserts at a rate of about one every two to three minutes I find the establishment too frustrating to patronize again. It sucks to watch your friends finish their dessert before yours arrives and then have them look bored while you eat yours.   Your subtle, understated product seems empty, flavorless and overpriced to me now."}
{"text":"I have actual cravings for Snoh that I have to fight. I've brought a couple of friends and got them hooked too. The taro Snoh with the almond cookie and pudding is out of this world. Everyone working is always super nice too. Really cool decorations in all of their locations too."}
{"text":"The most unique and flavorful dessert I've ever had. I'm a regular now and I enjoy the large taro on a plate with boba, lychee jelly and condensed milk."}
{"text":"I love this place  and I also got my five stars card to start earning them points! Means I go there a lot and they've noticed lol #ILOVESNOH"}
{"text":"Wow! I'd been craving thai tea and didn't want to venture far, and I noticed Snoh had just opened right up the street. Instead of getting a thai iced tea, I tried their shaved ice/ice cream hybrid in thai tea flavor. I added green tea mochi, boba, and condensed milk. Now I want to go every single day.   The snoh has an interesting consistency, creamier than shaved ice, but more subtle than ice cream. I especially love that it isn't too sweet, so the tea flavor really shines through. I was given a decent amount of toppings, enough to last me until the last bite, and the gal who prepared it poured on tons of condensed milk.  They have 5 other flavors, (I've also tried the taro - awesome!), and despite the seemingly limited menu, there are tons of potential combinations.    This is a seriously refreshing and tasty treat, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The shaved ice here was not great. I've had shaved ice so many times, and it's the first time I've ever left most of the shaved ice behind. The black sesame ice I ordered didn't have much flavor- it felt like I was just eating ice. No complaints about the mochi topping and condensed milk glaze though."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I came in to try snoh for the first time because we've heard great reviews! The decor is... What's the right word... Eclectic Chinese? I kind of dug it. They were playing some chicken cartoon which was a little weird though lol but I didn't mind. The snoh was delicious! I had the milk cream with sliced almonds and condensed milk, which was tasty and refreshing. I knocked off a star because the service could be a little better. The girl who helped us at the register was very unenthusiastic... You could tell she definitely didn't want to be there. When we told her this was our first time in she was expressionless and didn't say anything. When we asked her for suggestions she threw out one... The milk cream and Oreo. It was a great choice- my friend loved it- I just wish she made us feel more welcome and comfortable. And a couple more flavor combinations would have been nice too."}
{"text":"We went when we were in Phoenix last weekend. The ice is too sweet to my taste but they were very nice to let us to bring our dog in the store to enjoy the AC. It was almost 100 degrees. So that was very nice of them to do that."}
{"text":"Great idea for Snoh in Arizona, love the boba Thai tea, try the brick toast really good to share.  This place is constantly busy which indicates how delicious their Snoh is."}
{"text":"Love this place! Green tea or pistachio with almond cookies and black sesame is my fave. Greatest little dessert spot in town!"}
{"text":"Three out of five stars. I do not know if I got the person who puts the least amount of ice possible or not, but I felt like for the price I was paying, I might have been jibbed on ice. There was no one else there at the time so I was not sure how to compare. I will give the place another chance, for sure; the taste of the shaved ice was EXCELLENT. But the price was... unfavorable in my opinion. I will not order the shaved ice again, but I might try the boba tea. They are in a good location, next to Cherry Blossom. The parking is either great or terrible though depending on the time you go."}
{"text":"Amazing! I loved this place years ago when a friend brought me here and I love it now as it is just awesome and different than everything else. Great flavors, great service, and overall a great decorating scheme!   Try some of the ones you aren't sure about as you will most likely be very pleased! Some of them are a bit unknown to American eyes but this place is successful for a reason so give it a shot. Four stars because even though the hours that they close are 11 on a Saturday, they were closed by 8 for some reason at both locations. Very disappointing! Even though the voicemails on the phone numbers that I called all said they should have been open until 11."}
{"text":"Sunday, May 5th, green tea ice with condensed milk topped with green tea mochi & red bean.  The green tea was really refreshing and tasted like green tea. Mochi was chewy with red bean made exactly how I like it.    Monday, May 6th - original and taro with condensed milk, red bean, black sesame.  This combo wasn't my favorite.  The black sesame sounded better than it was for me.  The original with condensed milk was the classic, tasted so creamy and so good.    Friday, May 10 - It was a busy night.  There was a long line and one cash register.  They might want to consider opening another cash register to handle the weekend crowd.  I think I found my favorite combo.  It's the Thai tea with condensed milk and red bean.  Thai tea unbelievable, highly recommend!  A friend suggested to try the almond milk tea with almond pudding.  I love almond milk tea but never had it with almond pudding.  A lot of places make this tea way too sweet.  This drink was made perfectly!  I think I have an addiction now. I do not need an intervention yet, because I will be returning soon to mix more combos. =)"}
{"text":"Amazing. My favorite spot for a quick sweet. The staff is super friendly and it was a great atmosphere. Great alternative for those who want a frozen treat but don't do dairy."}
{"text":"Really bomb and unique way to satisfy your sweet tooth, the staff is laid back and friendly and the art in this place is always interesting"}
{"text":"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Dessert!!! It was love at first site! Every time I come here I'm impressed!! The brick toast!!  are you kidding me!!! And the place it's self is so fun great vibes I'm all about energy and the energy in there is on point!! Whatever you're doing keep it up!!"}
{"text":"How I see Arizona as a Californian..  \"Oh hey, they have corn hole every where.\"  On top of that..  - Scorching hot temperatures - Not enough quality Asian food.. :(   How I see Arizona as a Californian, after visiting Snoh Ice.. - Scorching hot temperatures.. until the flooded gates of Snoh Ice opens @ 12pm  - Not enough quality Asian food.. until I had my first taste of their Thai tea Snoh (MY FAVE!!!!!!) and chewy warm boba (SERIOUSLY?! IN ARIZONA?!? i expected hard, amatuer boba, but don't let their location fool YOU! SURPRISE!!!!!! DELICIOUS BOBA IS HERE!!!!!).  Everything I've tried at Snoh was a hit..  Their fruit ice teas with Boba.. So goood! Thai ice tea with Boba.. SOOOOO GOOOD! Taro Snoh, Thai Tea Snoh, Green Tea Snoh, MOCHI! FRESH FRUITS!! OMG OREOS!! GLAZE?!? WHAT'S GLAZE??! BLACK SESAME?! OOOOH! CHOCOLATE? CARAMEL?! OMG CONDENSED MILK?! CAN I JUST DRINK THEM ALL!??  I'm now back in California and am scratching my neck as speak, I think I'm addicted to their \"snoh\"....  and yes, we do have plenty of snoh ice like places in LA, but these snoh guys have got it down to a science.. perfect texture & taste.. like no other!   must try!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE SNOH. Been coming here since it opened and I'm still obsessed. I always get the Thai tea snoh with condensed milk, mochi and boba. I've also tried the taro and green tea snoh but this is definitely still the  best in my opinion! The inside is also really nicely decorated and they have games to play! They've opened up another location in Phoenix which is a lot nicer and newer so check that one out as well!!"}
{"text":"Taiwanese ice babyyy. Everything on point.  Love the decor and the atmosphere here.  Hmmm so I've been here multiple times. They always tend to mess up my order. Lolz, BUTTT they fix it right away, very apologetic and yet accommodating. Overall, great customer service. The owner and his mom is very friendly. She speaks Vietnamese to me all the time. Super cute lady.  I always get the Thai tea boba, and of course the taro shaved ice.. yummmmmm go get your shaved ice now."}
{"text":"Love at first sip.  I am a boba nerd.  I really love it.  Really fresh and yummy,  melty, boba in perfect milk tea.  Ok, gotta go.. trying the snoh next!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets great reviews but this experience and other past experiences leave me wondering. I ordered pistachio milk tea with less sugar and no boba. Guess what I was served? The opposite, full sugar, old rubbery boba and very watered down. Here's the kicker, a couple ordered pistachio milk tea after me and got theirs before me, what?! After 25min I got my complicated drink. Maybe it was too busy for the worker to keep up with the orders and just assumed that whoever walks in will get boba whether they like it or not. I cannot fault her, the guy that took the order didn't write on the cup the specifics on what to not put. The other time was when I ordered grass jelly instead of boba and the jelly was pulverized to make it look like there's a lot of it. This is definitely the last time I'll set foot in here, I'm sorry but a few mishaps is enough for me. An additional side note, there's plenty of boba places in California and Las Vegas that utilize a single worker that works the registers and make the drinks with fresh tea leaves on a cappuccino machine. It'll be busy but the drink will come out to you in less than 5min. Just saying."}
{"text":"The best shaved ice place in Phoenix. Service is friendly. Only complaint is the price for their goods are on the higher side but since they're pretty much the only place in the area that has shaved ice of this quality."}
{"text":"Green tea snoh with boba & condensed milk: - Green tea snoh: This had a light, fluffy texture which melts in your mouth. The texture is very airy and light, similar to cotton candy (but not as sickeningly sweet) if it were spun with ice. The snoh itself doesn't really taste much like green tea to me though; more like just a hint of green tea. The condensed milk seemed to enhance the green tea flavor to me? - Boba: Cooked perfectly so it was nice and chewy, not undercooked and hard nor overcooked and soggy. The bubbles didn't taste sweetened to me, which is fine since the condensed milk added sweetness. I know some people prefer their boba to be sweetened though.  House blend milk tea with boba: I had a couple of sips of this from my SO's order. It was okay to me, but I've had better. The milk tea itself wasn't very strongly flavored for me -- I would have liked a more strong and bitter tea flavor. It seemed a bit watered down to me. The boba, however, was cooked perfectly as described in the previous section above.   Atmosphere: The inside is very modern, which I enjoy. There is artwork on the walls and cool decorations, like mini mirrors on the wall. I believe there are also games to play like Jenga. Overall, this seems like it would be a great place to get a refreshing treat and pass time with friends!"}
{"text":"DIY fro-yo is so 2009.  Enter the west coast's newest frozen novelty: Snoh! Based off the Taiwanese shaved ice treat, baobing, Snoh has it all... A light, fluffy, customizable frozen dessert without those icky \"live and active cultures,\" now with the added appeal of Asian persuasion in flavors like green tea, Thai tea, black sesame, and mango.  Don't worry, there's still plenty of opportunity for terrible combinations of toppings and cups that not only permit, but encourage, spillover onto the table. It's everything you loved about froyo, only the texture is like thick locks of ice cream hair.   Snoh? More like Syes."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. What an amazing treat! I haven't had anything like this before. The guy at the register was super helpful when I told him it was my first time. Basically you pick a nice flavor. Then you pick a topping like fresh fruit or something a little more sinful. After that you pick a topping they drizzle on top. The small is the perfect size for one person after dinner. I want to try everything!"}
{"text":"This place caught my eye when I was eating at the noodle house next door... I came back a day later to satisfy my curiosity.   GREAT DECISION!   First of all, shave ice is where it's at. If you've ever been to Hawai'i, you know what I'm talking about. The snow factory in mcully shopping center on Oahu? Yup. This isn't some snow cone place,... it's so much more and so much better!  They have a really good menu of pre-made/designed options, or, a build your own kinda option. Yup, pick whatever you want. That's what's up. Maybe I will next time, bug for now, I went with the menu item. It was called breakfast something, and it was delicious. A cup of shaved ice, with a nice creamy milk and a gang of fruity pebbles! Those of y'all that know me, know I get down hard with fruity pebbles. My brand of choice is the plastic bag version Fruit Dino Bites, bite whatever... the pebbles can get it too! What an awesome creation and a delicious choice!   This place is decorated so awesomely! They have tons of very modern comic book / video game art decor lining the walls. Pretty spacious and legit seating options. Staff was friendly too.   This is definitely a spot to hit for dessert or even just snack time. A must try, and when in a city like Phoenix where the temp is always higher than normal, this is a great cool down spot - year 'round!  Snoh My God, Mayne."}
{"text":"Snow is not Shave Ice. We love that Hawaian treat, but this is better. Drier, even fluffier, it is the perfect medium for creative toppings. There are lines, they move fast enough, but you may be challenged to find a seat. As with save ice, we like to top with evap milk and fruit, but there are dozens of intriguing alternatives."}
{"text":"This is a great place amazing! The creativity of this place continues to amaze me. The atmosphere has a pop culture which is very welcoming. The staff is very friendly and the store itself very tidy (which is a big deal for me when it comes to going to restaurants/ dessert places). This location is very family friendly."}
{"text":"Confused.  That sums up my experience. When they were about to open, they had pictures of their snoh on plates but when I get there, we get froyo cups. Some people have dishes, I don't. Problem with that is that they put so much snoh in the cups, they pretty much cheat you with the toppings. I can't stress how little they give you and even with so little, there's no room to mix it in the cup. So, even though you've compromised, took a couple of calming breaths, and came to terms with the abysmal amount of toppings, 4 spoonfuls in there's no toppings and you're left with strawberry albeit bland snoh. Might as well slam your head into the table in defeat because you pretty much just paid for sugar syrup and ice.  I came with family and everyone's snoh was different. Some were soft like it's supposed to (strawberry), but some where so compact and hard like a brick (taro). My family are natives so they definitely didn't think it was THAT worth it to drive down to Phoenix to try it. Cherry blossoms next door is 3x more worthy to drive down for.  There's a new Snow that opened in the Mekong plaza so I'll try it, but my expectations won't be so high next time. As for others, it's a new and exciting concept and I understand that there's already nothing Asian-related in this desert, but just calm your titties down because it's not as great at the hype surrounding it claims to be."}
{"text":"The perfect midday pick-me-up. Snoh has options for the Asian preferences (black sesame, matcha, Thai tea, taro snoh), general fruity flavors (honey dew, coconut, and mango), and more.   Come to snoh for a single small shaved ice bowl for yourself, a large snoh (with options of more than one flavor) to share with a group or sweet drinks to take to go. It's a great spot that serves people of various sweet preferences!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place 2 years ago and every time we're nearby, I tell him we have to stop at snoh and get dessert! My fave is the taro snoh with strawberries and mochi on the side also top it off with lots condensed milk. So goooood!! I'm never disappointed with this place and people here are always friendly.."}
{"text":"I didn't actually go here yet, but a friend picked up a bowl of \"snoh\" for me yesterday. It was odd that it comes in a cup, with toppings like ice cream does. I'm used to the drinkable boba in a cup. I got the taro, with honey boba and caramel on top. Decent. Reminded me of gelato kinda, but I prefer the drinks from normal boba places."}
{"text":"I first came to this place the week it opened...unfortunately it was right before I was going to leave for a 3 month summer vacation back home to California. I was really excited a shaved snow place finally opened up in Phoenix! For those who don't know what shaved ice is, its different from crushed ice or what you would get in a snow cone. Shaved Ice is literally shaved from a big, flavored block of ice into a flaky \"melt on your tongue\" consistency.  The owners are also from California, and nowadays since shaved snow places are popping up everywhere like boba places in Cali, they were smart to bring their business here. It also means they know good quality since there is so much competition back home. Anyway, I went back recently and I'm glad to say there was a huge improvement in their flavors and quality since the first time I went.   My favorite flavors include the green tea, mango and taro. The flavors aren't too sweet or overpowering, so you can still enjoy the topping and glaze. I always go for the condensed milk and ask for extra too, but the black sesame glaze is yummy too, especially on the green tea ice. I always go for the fruit toppings, the cookie topping are good too.    I hope they put toppings like cheesecake and poundcake on the menu, and different flavored mochi!"}
{"text":"Great staff, OK parking, great location, outstanding selection, outstanding presentation, random fun, and OK prices but there are always some sort of deals going on. Bottom line, if I am anywhere in Phoenix and craving shaved ice or Boba I would stop by here. This place and location in general has a unique \"LA-vibe\" and is very welcoming."}
{"text":"really Asian-styled ice shavery~~ had mocha + red bean + strawberry + condensed milk~ like what I had when I was in Asia~"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my niece and nephews here and was a really nice place. I loved the things that they have from heros from comic books and movies that kids love to watch. They had games for the kids to keep them occupied. They do have delicious desserts and would love to comeback sometime."}
{"text":"This place is a bit baffling. I have been twice so far, one time was not good at all and the next time was excellent! I think I may have ordered the wrong thing on my first go (and that's why I gave it a second go and held off on reviewing). The first time I got the mango tango (or soemthing like that)...which was mango snoh with mango 'pudding,' mango jelly or something and some kind of caramel sauce I think.... it was really weird. Kind of tasted chemically....I think it was the sauce or the pudding (which was more like congealed substance than pudding). I left very sad. Anyway, the next time I went, I got thai tea snoh with nutella sauce and almond cookie...this was so ridiculously good. The Thai tea snoh had a great flavor...really captured the essence of the tea...the cookie gave it a good crunch and the sauce was nutella so it is pretty much required to be delicious. I will definitely be back again and recommend it....just order wisely my friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. After eating at cherry blossom we walked over to get a dessert. I love their taro milk tea boba. And also their green tea Snoh w mocchi, peach and caramel. It has less calories but not minus the flavor. The concept is very unique and I love this place"}
{"text":"Wow were my tastebuds impressed! Fantastic little hole in the wall dessert place. I can't believe I drove by on Camelback all these years and never tried Snoh! Had the honeydew ice with caramel and mochi...wow. So refreshing! Save your money from Creamistry and just come here instead. Really pleased with my dessert and can't wait to get back. I joked about how large the serving cups are - now I know to at least get the regular size next time, the small goes too fast. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In town for an event with customer.  Afterwards, I was craving for some boba tea.  Unfortunately, most are closed @ 9p or maybe 930p.  This is one of few that are open until 10p when we got there around 945p.  Got the taro milk tea with boba.  First thing I noticed is that they uses a plastic lid, and not the sealed wrapped top that most other boba are known for.  Traditionally, if the top is sealed, you can then give it a good shake to make sure the boba is loosen and everything is well mixed.  OK, it's purple, and has taro flavor.  Perhaps there was too much ice, but it tasted a bit watered down for a drink over $5.  The boba seemed to be about right in terms of it's chewiness, but just didn't have enough taro flavor overall.  Now, this review is only on the 1 time I've had the boba drink.  Perhaps their shaved ice is better, but for now, this is just a mediocre place.  By the way, when I used the credit card, it automatically added more than 15% tip, which I had to manually adjust it down.  I know it's all part of marketing, but I would appreciate if tip were added by the customer if its well deserved."}
{"text":"Almost all of their drinks are made from powders and are always too sweet. You can ask for them to be less sweet, but since they just reduce the powder then the drink tastes off; diluted. The actual bobas are really good; perfect consistency and always fresh. I've been here many times and they used to have a better loyalty program, now they're kind of cheaping out on the customers. Used to love them more but now i'm almost over it. Usually the people at the counters are nice but every once and awhile not so much."}
{"text":"This place is SOH SOH good! SNOH is a very unique dessert that has yet to catch waves. I remember when bubble tea took off over 15 years ago. There were multiple places serving it all over the place. This could be the next big thing. The dessert is shaved ice but tastes more like ice cream. It has a soft texture, yet is also creamy, so it's almost like a hybrid of the two.  The toppings add more uniqueness to the whole experience. There are cereal toppings which I never opt for (fruity pebbles, cinnamon toast crunch, etc.) and there are my favorite kind of Asian toppings available. You can choose from mochi balls, taro pudding, red beans, and boba. The large looks like it should be less, but since it's just shaved ice for the most part, you're not getting a whole lot of calories from it. The small is good for one sitting, and costs less than $5.   The atmosphere is very youthful. There are tables to play on while you enjoy your SNOH. They have games available for you to play with like Connect Four, UNO, Jenga, a standard deck of cards, and more! The establishment is pet friendly, so feel free to bring in Rupert for your next outing.   SNOH is a place I'll be visiting quite a few times in the near future."}
{"text":"Delicious! Unique! Fun! Dessert place! Those are the first words that come to mind when I think of this place. I have been to several boba places, but this takes it a step further and combines dessert, tea, shaved ice,and boba!   On this trip I had green tea shaved ice, honey boba and condensed milk. Mmmm! Delicious! Especially if you are a big fan of green tea the boba and condensed milk are just extra yummy treats. My boyfriend had the coconut shaved ice, boba, and condensed milk. I had a taste of it and it was just as delicious! It didn't have the superficial extra coconut taste that some coconut flavors can have. It was toasted and perfect.   I definitely look forward to another visit and highly recommend it. They also have games like jenga and uno to play while you hang out there. The customer service was wonderful there too. I also look forward to trying their boba teas/smoothies but they give the option to add a scoop of ice cream! So I can't wait to try that. I'll post about that too later."}
{"text":"The best boba I have ever had. Sadly I moved from central to west phoenix so I don't go often. But when we can we will."}
{"text":"Wow. There's nothing like Snoh. Anywhere.  Wish I hadn't waited so long to check this place out.  The texture is amazing. And the toppings are endless.  I tried #11 off their preset menu. It was a taro Snoh with almond cookie crumbles and a sweet sauce on top."}
{"text":"Its hard to find a convenient place to grab boba in Phx!!! This place is delicious and has so many different flavor options. Staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"I ordered a the original with strawberries, almond cookies and chocolate syrup. It was actually really good, the only thing was next time I will order maybe strawberry or green tea because the original really has no flavor its just straight up snow lol  I tried strawberry with mango and the strawberry had a lot of flavor.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the service was just okay, they weren't very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after buying their Groupon. Service was quick and friendly, though the flavors of the snoh were less than great. We love snoh from a pho place near our house and we're excited to try elsewhere but it seems not all places make it the same way. This one lacked flavor and wasn't quite as creamy as others we've had. Was a good deal with the Groupon but wouldn't pay full price for it. If we come back, we'll try the boba smoothies next time. We did enjoy the games available for customers to play at their tables though."}
{"text":"Definitely the most reliably refreshing thing you can get in the summer. They have a great variety of flavors, toppings, and add-ons. The boba is always the perfect texture, not too soft, not too hard, which seems to be difficult to achieve at other establishments. I can't wait until they open a downtown location!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed being here when I was a tourist! I was craving bubble tea and this place was the closest to where I was in Downtown Phoenix. It looks small on the outside, BUT it's roomy and spacious on the inside with a lot of seating.  \"Snoh\" SHAVED ICE: I ordered Green Tea Shaved Ice with condensed milk, boba (tapioca pearls), and mochi. It was absolutely delicious. They have 3 sizes, small regular and large to what I remember, so I picked the regular size. For me, that was too much for me because I also ordered bubble tea for myself and it was only one size. However, I did finish the shaved ice because of course I couldn't take it to go since it'll just be a bowl of mush when I got to my hotel room. I could taste the green tea and it wasn't overbearing or not too subtle. The mochi was a bit chewy and slightly hard, maybe because it's sitting next to a big scoop of ice. I could have used more condensed milk in mine but it depends how you like your ice.   BUBBLE TEA:  I ordered Taro milk tea with boba (tapioca pearls) and egg pudding. They only had one size so I didn't expect it to be so big. Back home where I'm from, I'd say the size that I was given at this place was comparable to a size between a Grande and Venti at Starbucks. I couldn't finish it after I ate my shaved ice. It was good, sweet but not too sweet and the boba was delicious and milk tea was creamy. Egg pudding was a bit grainy and not smooth compared to my favorite Snow Mountain back home, but it was decent and I didn't mind since I have been craving it my entire trip in Phoenix. Definitely worth a try and satisfied my cravings.  Overall, I like the place. It gives you a lot of options to your shaved ice and your bubble tea. The ambiance is modern and the music that's being played is metal/punk/alternative rock possibly. The employees are helpful to answer your questions and as a tourist, I feel like I asked too many questions plus I didn't have my glasses on with me so I had to ask them to read off the things on their menu. I'd love to come here again if I'm ever in town in the near future!"}
{"text":"Tried green tea snoh with black sesame glaze this time around. A few of my other friends also ordered the green tea snoh. General consensus was that the flavor was very mild, almost non-existent. It was good when you ate it with toppings, but without the toppings it was pretty much flavor-less. Probably won't try that flavor again!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with a variety of flavors to try. I recommend the Thai Tea with Almond Cookies and condensed milk glaze"}
{"text":"Might need to give this place a second chance. The service was great and the atmosphere was uplifting. The reason I am giving it a 3 star is because I didn't like what I ordered. I had never had taro snoh and the cashier said it would taste like vanilla/coconut... Well.. Lol it actually tasted like the popcorn jelly beans from Harry Potter. Not good. And my Thai tea was too strong"}
{"text":"Let it Snoh, let it Snoh, let it Snoh...  I finally got to try Snoh with some friends the other day and I now finally understand what the hype's all about:  There's nothing like a bowl of perfectly fluffy shaved ice to beat the hot Arizona heat!  The shaved ice was so fluffy and just melts in your mouth..  Toppings and mix-ins are plentiful and there's a wide variety of sizes so you can choose your sweet sweet poison.  This place is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I was expecting regular shaved ice and was pleasantly surprised at what I found. It's shaved ice, but with a definite twist.  It's not as literal as shaved ice, but instead is a light and airy substitute. They describe it as \"fluffy\". You pick your ice flavor, your toppings and your glaze. I had mango ice with boba and lychee jelly toppings and a condensed milk glaze. It was fantastic!  The regular size looks gigantic, but I easily finished it because it was so easy to eat. This is the perfect summer treat, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not your usual shaved ice and boba tea... the looks of the food definitely threw my party off... but absolutely delicious once you got going!! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Loveeee this place, awesome decor and dessert! Always comin back for more and always w the best service n friendliest staff who are great to me and my Freddy haha!!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Parking is a little tough during dinner time (I would assume also lunch). I just got a mango boba iced tea which was delicious. My boyfriend got the ice cream stuff. It was yummy!   I don't know if it was just the night we were there, but there were SO many children running around this place. It was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think. I mean I love kids, but they seemed to echo in this place."}
{"text":"Really good, really interesting take on the concept of shaved ice. I tried the strawberry topped with oreos and chocolate glaze - really sweet, but yummy. I think I like the original shaved ice flavor best. The caramel topping is delicious without being overly sugary. It was also really nice that they use fresh fruit instead of compote.  Snoh is definitely worth a try. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing flavors! Unique blends of dessert with Asian twits. Fried my and fun environment."}
{"text":"I got an almond Thai milk tea. My friend wanted a normal milk tea and they said they didn't have any. How can you get to almond milk tea without normal milk tea? It was mostly my fault, but there was a ton of ice! I drank it in 5 min and the cup was 80% full of ice. The milk tea was very average. My friend's snow was nice though."}
{"text":"I love snoh! I take all my friends here! The service is great and they always make me smile. They even remember my name lol. I would definitely suggest this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get their Thai iced tea with boba. It tastes fresh and their boba is at the right consistency and size. They have the best tea drinks in the valley."}
{"text":"Snoh Ice Shavery gives a good mix of Hawaiian type shaved ice but with the ability to add menu interesting toppings, such as honey boba and jellies.  They also serve boba drinks, although we didn't try one this time.  It is a very casual and laid back atmosphere to enjoy your time with friends or family."}
{"text":"Lunch adventure today- Snoh Ice Shavery in Phoenix.  My name twin's sorority sister opened up this shop and she wanted me to come tag along with her to check the place out.  When you first walk in, you notice how modern and trendy this place is.  The tables and floors are nice and clean.   There were so many options to choose from! This was my combination; Small: green tea, mango pudding with sweetened condensed milk.  Simply put,  AMAZEBALLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!  When I ordered he took my name and even said it again after giving me my change.  I can see this place as a hangout spot and the owners/workers knowing you on a first name bases.  In turn, would make customers for life.   Consistency is accurately described as fluffy.  It is not heavy at all. Do you really think I could eat a small regular ice cream by myself? Three bites into eating regular ice cream would be having me running the bathroom. I am full Vietnamese ok?, which means of course I am sentenced with a life time full of non-dairy products and have to eat basically everything lactose free. However, I had to try this out, even if I get the bubble guts. GUESS WHAT?! It didn't hurt my stomach at all. I ate the whole thing too.  The question is... would I come back and the answer is uh, Hell yes! They need to open up a shop on the East side.   I also took a sticker, I am putting it on my baby's little coupe car and will post the picture soon :)"}
{"text":"I found Snoh a few years ago when voting in the Phoenix Best of.. I love it! The shaved ice is amazing, the tea is amazing. We don't get to go often, but I've never been disappointed when we've gone."}
{"text":"This is shaved iced on a different level folks.  This is not your snow cone ice or your Hawaiian ice.  This is Taiwanese ice.  Smooth and velvety with infused flavors such as taro, green tea, strawberry, mango, and Thai tea.  If you never thought it was possible to put those exotic ingredients into ice then you definitely need to come down to check it out.  My favorite is taro, I die by the taro, its my usual to go flavor for most desserts/snacks.    To take it up another notch, throw in some of these toppings: mochi balls, mango, lychee, cheesecake bites, strawberries, lychee jelly, almond pudding, mango pudding, boba, orea cookies, and kiwi.  I know this list seems overwhelming but do your best to see what complements what flavor of ice.  But who the heck cares, mix and match however way you want, this is your masterpiece we're talking about here.  But wait, it doesn't end there, you also add a glaze: condensed milk, caramel, chocolate, taro condensed milk, green tea condensed milk, and black sesame.  Imagine the glaze as the icing on the top, it brings everything together.  Pricing is reasonable for these yummy and refreshing delights.  You get three sizes: small, medium or large.  Each size you get atleast 1 topping and 1 glaze.  The ambiance is funky fresh, hip, and urban-esque.  The staff are energetic and enthusiastic.  Stop by and check them out.  Peace and happy nomming."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Amazing boba teas & their SNOH bowls are unbelievable. So happy to see such a cool concept/vibe in Phoenix! Highly recommend Thai Tea SNOH with boba, whip cream and condensed milk! To die for!!!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I found a new favorite ice cream place. This finally took its place. I'll always visit Bahama bucks but this place is very refreshing flavors and texture.    We love getting the large snoh and having them put it on a plate for all of us to share"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place, but it seems like there's some kind of secret stuff you can order (kinda like In N Out) that we don't know about...because when I see my friends pictures of their Snoh, it's nothing I've seen on the menu.  Nonetheless, what I get is surely delicious.  I usually order the taro snoh with coconut mochi and sweet cream.  I have recently learned that if you order it \"here\" on a plate, you get more for just about the same price instead of in the cup.  Not much seating area in this place, so best to just eat on the go."}
{"text":"Finally something different to try.   This place is pretty great and super hard to explain. It's so light and fluffy, not like a snow cone but ice like for sure but milky however not even close to being like Ice cream, gelato or froyo. With that said, it's a must try just for the experience. They offer a great variety of toppings but nothing crazy like fruity pebbles or gummy bears.   The only thing it needed was more toppings. I would suggest asking for extra of whatever toppings you get.   My daughter chose carmel as one of her toppings and holy wow, probably the best carmel I have ever tasted...sorry churn.   I can't wait to go back...I kinda want to open up my own shop on the north side of Phoenix.   Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is very tasty in flavor and everything is freshly made. It would be nice if they were consistent about offering you a punch card or at least reminding you about it. They are very fast with service so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Wow. This is so good!  If you are looking for something different give this a try!  Service is great and it is a fun atmosphere. I had the Taro with mochi balls and black serene. Try it.....you will like it."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Taiwanese-style shaved ice and it has got me hooked.  I had the taro snoh with red bean, green tea mochi and black sesame glaze.  LOVED the taro snoh and black sesame glaze.  I'll have to pass on the mochi next time because I didnt' like how it got harder and less soft and chewy the longer it was in the snow.  Great atmosphere to hang out, they have board games at every table."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived 10 minutes before Snoh opened, but the guys at the counter suggested that we hang out on the couch until they were ready for us. Very cool of them.   This place was rad. I had a thai tea shaved ice with red bean, almond cookie and black sesame glaze. It was amazing. My husband had the strawberry with fresh strawberries on top and condensed milk glaze - also very good. My son had taro with sliced almonds and caramel; again it was delicious and worth the drive from Peoria."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT customer service here. Came in around 4pm on a Wednesday and they were decently busy. It was my first time here and if you're a boba lover like myself, every place is different. I had a few questions (being vegan you can rarely not ask) and the staff was totally knowledgable about their menu. I created a monster of a drink, a green milk tea with 1/2 a scoop of matcha and honey boba. ALL their drink are non-dairy, which was great! They generally don't offer matcha as an add in, but that's how I like and the gentleman who made my drink was totally awesome and even added a bit extra milk after I first tried it and it was a touch bitter. Overall, speedy, excellent customer service and great drink! Will definitely be back to try their snoh."}
{"text":"Great central location for Snoh Ice Shavery.  Who would think a Ice Shavery would do so well in Phoenix especially with the 100 degrees temperatures. What a great concept.   Snoh you really added a nice different twist to cold treats to our city.  A great many of combinations to go with and what ever you taste is go for it and don't be close minded to what ever people can come up with.  I on the other hand am on the conservative side and order primarily the same core items and may vary slightly.  I go for the original, Strawberry or mango ice and then will add mango and strawberries and top it off with condensed milk.  There is a reason why this place is always busy. Clean different dessert and a great place for the young and not ad young.  Love taking out of town people here for a different dessert treat."}
{"text":"If you're trying to cool off in this hot weather...you should probably give this place a try! Love the taro shaved ice!  Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"It's about damn time!!  We finally have a new dessert place in town! This one just happens to come in the form of some Delicious Asian Funkiness.  It's cheap, creative, tasty, and just a \"must go to\" kind of place.  5 stars for Snoh!"}
