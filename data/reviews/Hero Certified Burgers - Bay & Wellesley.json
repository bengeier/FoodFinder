{"text":"I just moved across the street from here so the place is good when I'm really desperate for a burger.   I guess it's what you expect from a chain. The beef patties are frozen and a little on the bland and texture-less side. The free veggie add-ons are great, however any bacon/cheese add-ons will dig deep into your wallet. I love the sauces and always ask for some extra on the side to dip fries in. Fries are soggy, but okay if you enjoy them that way. The overpriced milkshakes are FANTASTIC because they're soft serve. Fountain drinks are unlimited though.   This location has super-nice employees, but they are a tad on the slow side. I'm usually almost done my drink by the time it arrives.  There's nothing special about HeroBurgers. It's a good place to go when you're lazy and desperate, but I'd rather save the money and go to McDonalds.   **If you sign up for HeroBurger online with an email, you get a free milkshake on your first combo purchase. ;)"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and attentive, the place is clean and shiny, and the drinks are bottomless.  Unfortunately that's about the extent of my praise for Hero Certified Burgers. This visit was my first experience with the chain, and I had high hopes given how loudly they praise their beef and ethically sourced ingredients. I was expecting, well... I can't exactly say what I was expecting, but it wasn't a burger that looked like it had been pressed out by an industrial machine then flash frozen.  The burger itself was nothing to write home about, it didn't have much in the way of flavor, and the extra add ons (I had mine with swiss cheese and mushrooms) weren't quite worth what they wanted for them ($1.39 and $.99 respectively).  The fries were mushy and wet with an odd aftertaste, they too tasted like they had been frozen.  All in all it was a meal I wouldn't have minding paying $6-7, not the nearly $13 that it came out to. If you're looking for something new to try I'd try something else, and if you're just looking for a nice comfort burger you're better off with a generic chain. The quality will be about the same and the price will be far lower."}
{"text":"Really nice burger joint on a popularly ventured street. The person at cash taking your order is such a pleasant guy, he happily accommodated my requests for a plain burger. This place is neatly innovative, offers the newer Coke Freestyle machines and the dual Heinz Dip and Squeeze ketchup. Very cool! Love that they offer free wifi, got to enjoy a burger while finishing up some work. Some may say this place is a tad on the pricier side-- I'll definitely agree. Overall: burgers are good, service is sweet, cool innovations."}
{"text":"I just love their burgers so much! The people here are very nice and lovely  I like the idea for it to be light on crowd.. It take some time to make the order but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place looks great and I really like the idea of being able to build your own burger, the burger itself left alot to be desired.  First, the color and consistency of the burger patty was off - it had almost a grayish hue to it and did not taste like beef. I know their whole selling point is the quality of the beef and how it's sourced, but it tasted like alot of filler and nothing that resembled beef. I almost think I was mistakenly given a veggie burger? My stomach also felt horrible afterwards."}
{"text":"They always have consistently good service both interms of the food and the staff, who btw are ridiculously friendly, and nice. My favourite is the chicken burger with turkey bacon, along with a side of poutine or fried beans. Not the healthiest stuff in the world, but once in a while its pretty yum for the tum. Its pretty pricey I'd say for a mere burger, but then again you're paying for quality ingredients."}
{"text":"In a world dominated by the McDonalds and KFCs, Hero appeared on the scene bringing a breath of freshness. The burger chain claims to use good quality meat, sans hormones and antibiotics. They also serve vegetarian burgers made from soyabean - and these burgers are actually delicious! Chicken burgers are tasty too, you get a slice of chicken breast as opposed to the pureed-fried McDonalds crap. Hero has also made gluten-free quite mainstream, their flatbreads are amazing!  I like their build-your-own concept and for sure burgers taste better with their signature hot sauce, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato and some pickles on the side. Enjoy with some fries and a slew of unlimited carbonated beverages from a funky machine.  This location is close to my work and I find the service quite efficient too."}
{"text":"Poutine had a sweet and very processed taste to it. Definitely not fresh cut fries. The amount of cheese was generous though.   I didn't try the burgers so I can't review them."}
{"text":"I like how nice the staffs here are. They literally treat everyone like we were kids living next door. They even put up plastic protection pieces to sharp edges on the wall. See the picture."}
{"text":"Went here to buy take out for lunch. I had had HERO burgers few times back at yonge and eglinton area and it was fine there just a normal regular 4oz burger.   This time I give a try for the 4oz bamboo charcoal burger. Nothing special about the dark charcoal bun but gotta pay $0.99 for it and the regular bun taste much better.   Toppings I asked for lettuce, onions , ketchup and mayo. Not enough sauce and toppings at all I mean the amount of it. Can't even taste any of the topping. Also, ordered a gravy and is too watery and not much of a gravy taste.   The cashier was too rush while I'm thinking what to order and there is no one behind me waiting to order.   I understand that most franchise chains will never get the same customer service and the right taste. Well if I wants more HERO burger I think I would go back to yonge and eglinton."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several locations because this is the only burger chain around that offers a gluten free option, so while this review is for this location, it applies to several other locations as well as the experience has been the same. I like the build your own burger approach - it makes it real easy to customize and get just what you want. I also like that they use ABF and hormone free Canadian beef, a real plus. The burger itself is disappointingly lacking in flavour, however. It's definitely a step up from McD's and the rest of the fast food junk, that much is for sure. While I'm on the gluten free soap box, the biggest disappointment is that the burger is the only solid food here that is gluten free. All the sides, including their frozen fries and rings are processed with wheat fillers so they are off limits. For a chain trying to capture part of the upscale market, using real potatoes might be a good place to start improving their menu. I eat here when I can't find anything else edible nearby, that's about it. If you are looking for a burger that's one step up from a Whopper, then this is your place."}
{"text":"To begin, the staff are extremely nice.  The guy running the place will bring your tray over to you and give you your drink before the burger is ready.  The actual location is one of those below-a-condo-has-been-turned-into-27-different-shops-in-the-last-3-years type of place but it is very clean and tidy. My issue is that it takes FOREVER to your food.  Every time I've gone I've managed to pulverize an entire milkshake while waiting for my meal.  Also, the buns are usually not toasty and it is really, really expensive if you start throwing in the fun and tempting add-ons. For a combo with a milk shake and another milk shake I paid over $20.  That is a lot of money for a burger, fries and 2 shakes. Finally, I love their milk shakes because they are done with soft serve.  SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. I usually get the 6oz burger and dress it up however I want! It's super fast and the burgers are fresh. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The place is bright and all sparkly-new. The people there are super-friendly and nice. All smiles and hellos, and the service is spot-on. However, it's a shame that the burger is so... meh. I had the Signature Burger, which had a 6oz burger with cheddar and \"Hero Sauce.\" While the patty is fairly juicy, and I like the fact that the beef is supposed to be \"free-range\" and sustainable, I find it weird that the patty is obviously factory-produced and perfectly round. It doesn't taste as fresh and meaty as I would expect from a restaurant that places so much emphasis on their meat. On the other hand, the seeded egg bun was soft and warm (are you listening, Gourmet Burger Co? YOUR COLD BUNS LEAVE ME COLD!). Anyway, next time I go to Hero, maybe I'll try something other than a beef burger; they offer veggie burgers and chicken breast sandwiches.  I like the fact that the packaging is sustainable. Halal? Heck yeah!  And did I mention that the people that work there are really nice? I just wish the burger was better."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at how many people gave this place a bad review. Most seem to be from a year or more ago, so maybe something has changed since then.  This location is very clean and tidy. The man who takes your order is SO nice and helpful. Seriously, the guy alone is reason to go. I wish I could tip here, but you can't.  The food itself is good. I normally get the 4oz Hero Burger and sometimes fries. The burger itself is great. 4 oz is a healthy sized patty and I would suggest only going for the 6 oz if you're very hungry. The fries are good too and the fountain drinks are unlimited. The wait time for your food is about five minutes, which I think is pretty acceptable seeing as how it's made to go. Honestly, it's about as long as you'd wait if you go to McDonald's at a busy time.   The place also has sundaes, shakes, salmon burgers, chicken burgers, and other things, but I have never tried them. They have a gluten-free menu and soy burgers.  The only negative I can think for this place is it's price-point. A 4 oz burger+fries comes out close to 10 dollars. Yes, that's less than you'd pay at a restaurant and the quality is much better than a lot of fast food places, but I wish everything on the menu was about a dollar less."}
{"text":"Perfect location. Good food. Great service.  The owner is always friendly and cheerful. He stands patiently at the cash register with a smile.   I wouldn't call this a \"fast food\" place, because it'll take more than 15 minutes for them to make your order.  Everything's made fresh, made to order. There aren't old burger patties staying warm in a tray. The poutine is delicious. I've gotten the kids meals a dozen times, it's decent value at $5 for burger, a juicebox and fries. I used to love their fancy soda machine.  Overall, one of my old favourite spots to eat at. Great for last minute lazy dinners."}
{"text":"Very happy with the burgers here. Extremely friendly staff always happy to help. Definitely appreciate the pop machine with great flavours. One does have to wait a bit for the burgers, but it is worth the wait in the end."}
{"text":"This is where I'll come if I am super hungry and just want to grab a takeout and go home to watch Netflix so no one sees me stuff myself with delicious junk food.   Everyone knows their brand so I'll just go ahead and review the quality of the store. I always get the turkey fiesta (if you haven't tried it and just been sticking to their hero burger you're missing out on the flavour!) 1/3 times they will make it well with the perfect amount of cranberry sauce and melted Swiss cheese but normally it's too less cranberry sauce and hardish plasticy cheese...  On the other days I would get their hero burger, nothing fancy just a good burger beef patty with yummy sauce.   If I'm really feeling like I don't care about my healthy diet (which I rarely care) I will get the poutine. They always give enough cheese curds that's nicely melted. Mmmm! What I would change is maybe the fries can be crispier. Oh before I finish my review just to warn you you'll be quite thirsty after the poutine so make sure you have water with you.   Definitely hits the deliciously salty, cheesy poutine spot!   P.S service is great! The nice old man will bring your order and greet you kindly (he's not like this to his employees though.. But I always see his good side LOL)"}
{"text":"I don't know if they changed things up in the kitchen in the past couple of months or so but I was actually pretty impressed with this Hero Burger location. The place is nice and clean and I like the layout .  I ordered a regular ol' beef 4 oz. burger and it was just fine. The buns are pretty good.  I also had some of the Cranberry Turkey Fiesta Burger or whatever it's called, and that was actually really really delicious. It seems most of the bad reviews here are regarding their overhyped beef, so perhaps give their non-beef patties a try instead.  The service is excellent. The cashier is an incredibly nice and friendly guy who seems like he genuinely wants you to get the best service possible. Even though it's a fast food joint, he delivered the meals to our table.  It's quite expensive but I'd definitely come here again for their special burgers. It seems like I'll stick to the non-beefy ones, though."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but definitely not great.  The burgers are fried on a stovetop, not cooked on a grill. I used to go to Bareburgers but it closed."}
{"text":"Delivery Burgers were AWFUL.   I am generally a fan of Hero Burger (regularly frequenting other locations) because it's a decent veggie burger and has enough bacon options to satisfy my very \"meat friendly\" husband. However when we ordered delivery service from this location, it was a truly horrible experience.    The delivery time wasn't too bad, about an hour. But! The burgers were varying levels of BURNED, dry, or inedible.  The bacon, not crispy, but burned. The smaller patties, burned. The buns - toasted to the point of being dry. The veggie burger less burned but overcooked to the point of dryness. The bun, dry/crunchy/stale/BURNED.   Never again at this location. Horrible."}
{"text":"Grey rubbery processed frozen patty. Direct reaction: my bowels opened up."}
{"text":"Hero Burger  Onion Pro   Review:  Wow man bad customer service much?  First they got my order wrong, so I said the Onion Pro and they thought I got the Junior Onion Pro so I paid like $3 something.  Then afterwards the lady comes back and says that I need to pay more money because she typed it in wrong.  Then I have to pay an extra $2.70.  So I'm like fine whatever.  And after I get my burger, I ask are you sure that you gave me the right burger?  And they're like do you not trust us? Check, its 2 patties. Im just like wtf. I'm just making sure.   Then theres a sandy bite in my burger, I tell the manager this and he accuses me of lying.  And his wife said that all their food is perfect and from headquarters and even says that I can call headquarter to complain.   Honestly, worst fast food experience I had so far.  Generally, I'm a pretty big fan of hero burger but this location with horrible customer service makes the whole experience disappointing.  I will NEVER be coming back again."}
{"text":"I come here because it is close to my office. The food is decent, but the wait is ridiculously long. For a shake and a poutine with no one ahead of me took close to 15 minutes. My friend teased that they were still harvesting the potatoes. So if you are in a rush, don't come here."}
{"text":"I had a 6 ounce burger combo and was quite pleased with the product and the variety of items you could have put on your burger. For example, I had red onions, Zucchini relish and honey dijon on my burger. The burger was really good, though the 6 ounce was smaller than I thought it would be, I might get the 8 ounce next time. Still, the burger was good...   The fries were good and not that greesey... and the sodas were not only bottomless, but the machine you got them from has a insane amount of pops to select from. Get this, I had an Orange flavoured Coke Classic. That was awesome, and I could have had Cherry or Vanilla Coke, or other types like grape sprite. That was a cool addition to the combo and it made for a fun dining experience!   For the price we paid for our respective combos, $8.99 plus tax, it was pretty good. I will definitely give it another go when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"We used to eat takeout from the Hero Burger that was located at Bathurst and Bloor, but after they closed we decided to try the Bay Street location. First of, the service was inattentive. Showing up there was no welcome or how can I help you. We ordered a couple of different burgers and fries for takeout and discovered that the fries had not been cooked properly making them soggy and inedible. We will not be back."}
