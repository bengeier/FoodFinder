{"text":"Favourite pizza around! It's a little pricey, but completely worth it. Only fresh ingredients, and big actually gourmet slices."}
{"text":"One word.  AMAZING !!!  Best pizza ever.  The only other pizza I can think of that comes close is Boston Pizza.  This place puts on more toppings and charges less!  The previous review claimed it is expensive and gave it 4 stars because of that.  Oh well.  Next time I crave pizza in Bolton I know where to go."}
{"text":"I visited Caruso today for lunch while I was in town on business. For $7.80 I got a re-heated day old slice of pizza that was Luke warm at best. \"Table service\" was unorganized. You walk in, place your order at the counter then are given a number and told to go find a table. One waitress brought my slice to my table while another got me some utensils and a third brought me a glass of water.   So I decided to get an espresso on the way out thinking, Italians do good espresso, right? Even the espresso was about the same quality as Tim Hortons. I think next time, given the choices in the area, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was here once a few years ago when they first opened. Pizza was absolutely fantastic, but I was a little outraged with the price, I think it was between $7-10 for ONE slice. Crazy right?"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!! I get the gourmet slices, but my wife loves their basic pepperoni slice.  Dine in or take out.  It's also a cafe with my favorite coffee in town and a small selection of really good cupcakes and cheesecakes.  If the prices weren't on the high side I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!! I get the gourmet slices, but my wife loves their basic pepperoni slice because the crust is fantastic.  I usually prefer thin crust, but this crust is the exception.  It's also a cafe, with my favorite coffee in town and a small selection of really good cupcakes and cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory.  Be warned -- the gourmet slices are expensive.  But they're so big and filling I still think they're worth it.  I shouldn't have written this review on an empty stomach... ah what the heck, I'm going to pop over for a slice right now."}
{"text":"Recommended by a good friend...  And he was dead on! Plenty of choices of slices (even on a Saturday) Great pies. Great people. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Sorry people but you've missed your chance for the best pizza in the world.  Sadly this restaurant has closed."}
{"text":"Pizza's are good here but the prices does not justify it. Quite pricy.  Service lacked with high school like kids taking the orders and serving.  Service is the reason why I will not return."}
