{"text":"Honestly...they weren't that good. The egg rolls were spicy a'f. And the service was terrible. It took 1:30 to only get a 2sandwiches and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Never had been to this fine establishment  Service sucked very slow  Water tasted very dirty  Got served raw yes raw chicken wings  Never again"}
{"text":"The service was good. The food on the other hand was blah, it had no flavor. But worst of all it was 50 degrees outside and they had the door wide open, the seats and tables were cold."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and friends and we loved it! Great food and beer with a very chill atmosphere. Kudos to the waiter for being very efficient and on top of things!! I would recommend coming here and I know I will be back for more next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful atmosphere with wonderful refreshing customer service after a long week of work coming here was just what i needed. my belly was full and so was my glass all night. I had the Wexler burger and fries can i say way more than what i expected i was with 2 of my friends and they enjoyed the ribs and wings we were kind of doing a wine tasting and the girls at the bar were so knowledgeable of all the wines and different beers too. I just had to know who cooked the food and Chef Mike welcomed us with a warm smile and was very grateful and welcomed us back. I will be back very soon. Thanks guys for a wonderful evening after a long week of work! Wexler's is the place to be!"}
{"text":"The fish fry is amazing! The first time we went I was nervous because it looks like a dive bar from the outside and we had our kids but it was totally kid friendly inside! Highly recommend this place. The only thing I can fault them for is that they need more seating. It gets pretty cramped in there."}
{"text":"I had the cod sandwich and fries, to say the least I was extremely disappointed. It was like walking into a smoke factory in an unfinished basement. Very gloomy. The worst french fries I ever tasted! Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"I used to go there during weekdays, it was good! But, when I went on Friday, I was waiting for one hour for my food when I got different dish other than what I've ordered! That pissed off my day!"}
{"text":"Spending the better part of the day celebrating Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucky Derby. Drink specials include mint juleps and red stag derby peach. Stacey is at the helm as your beverage applications engineer. Do stop in for some healthy libations as well as superior customer service.....,with a smile. Tell Stacey Doll Face sent you.I"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. A couple tables of seniors were having lunch and seemingly enjoying themselves. Several lunch specials on the menu, I had Cindy, my sever decide for me. Brought out a hot Italian sub that was very good,,,didn't fit on the nicely toasted roll. Included fresh cut fries that were very good. Through in a couple of $2.00 16oz Labatt Blue's, and you got the fixens for a good meal.   Cindy was very attentive, place was clean, including restrooms,  Nice craft beer selection (8) on tap. Would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"On a snowy Sunday met up with some friends here to watch a game. Was pleasantly surprised by their selection of craft beers and menu items. Along with your standard bare fare of wings burgers and mozzarella sticks they also had escargot among menu items. I opted for the mini corn dogs, tots and wings all of which were delicious.  The interior matches the exterior of this towny bar which is a little worn for the wear but is staffed by a very friendly bunch of people.   My biggest complaint is that on a snowy day the temperature inside the bar wasn't all that different from the cold Cleveland temps.  If you are looking for a neighborhood joint defiantly give Wexlers a try."}
{"text":"Our family eats here several times whenever we are in town. The staff is excellent from the friendly new owner, to the incredibly talented cook & the terrific servers & bartenders. We love the tavern like atmosphere which also has several booths for seating (in addition to tables) and a cozy fireplace for ambience. There is a nice bar area too. We have tried many items on the menu & it has all been delicious! APPETIZERS: the very unique Buffalo Rolls, Chicken Wings (amazing), Mozzarella Sticks & Onion Rings SALAD: Classic Steak Salad ENTREE: Ribs (tender & tasty), Reuben Melt, Tavern Burger, Chicken Philly Sandwich & Chicken Fingers. We are mixed family consisting of foodies and picky eaters & everything here has been consistently excellent! We can't wait to try their famous Friday Fish Fry!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night and the bar appeared to be understaffed and was half full. The bartender was also serving as the waiter and cook.  However, the service was still good and we didn't mind the 30 minute wait for our food because we were enjoying our draft Sam Adams octoberfests. I was pleasantly surprised at my meal's plate presentation- 4 crisp pierogis (menu had advertised 3 so nice bonus) lightly brushed with butter, served with carmelized onions and sour cream yum! All on a clean, modern plate- not at all what I had expected to see when I walked in the door.      The tavern needs some updating on the inside. We sat at a table that offered booth seating on one side and chairs on the other. The booth cushion wasn't secured to the bench and would slide around. The tables are dark (candles in a pub are always a nice touch, c'mon you can buy them at a dollar store! Cheap but creates nice ambiance).  The tavern also has a fireplace but was unfortunately not turned on. There's no outside patio, unless the picnic table in the back by the dumpsters and a tiki torch counts. Bathrooms were clean. Overall,  our dining/bar experience was a pleasant one"}
{"text":"Went for lunch in a Saturday   Barmaid took our order and even told us about specials. We ordered a ice tea, unsweetened and a water.   Played keno while waiting for our burgers and wings we ordered.  About 10 minutes later our barmaid comes back and tells us there is no cook. He went to store or something and is not answering his phone. Then she tells us a mix up in schedule and he is in Cincinnati.  Really She voids our order and brings me a check for the ice tea....$2.75. Okay I win at keno and try to cash it in and she comes back and says no keno drawer WTF.  What really bothers me is she charged us for an ice tea with all these problems"}
{"text":"I could take it or leave it.  Stopped in here to use a Groupon I had purchased.  It was game day and the bar was lined with Brown's fans (I'm a Steeler's fan and this isn't the bad part haha).  The rest of the place was empty.  The food was good, came out quickly but I wouldn't rave about it.  It was typical bar food good.  My biggest complaint is how loud it is in there - even when no one is talking, the tv's were extremely loud.  We couldn't even carry on a conversation at our table.  I like the place itself, had a nice atmosphere and very cozy - a little worn down but I think that adds to it's charm.  I would go back again if someone else wanted to go but I wouldn't crave it."}
{"text":"Giving this place only a 3 star rating is hard to do because there's so much I like about it; great onion rings (the old fashioned kind I love) home made style french fries (which I love) some fantastic burgers and sandwiches AND some great beer specials! So why only a 3 star rating, you might ask. They promote their ribs as the be all, end all to ribs. Now let's face it folks, if you have lived in Cleveland for any length of time, then you know great ribs when you taste them. These were a joke, sorry if that sounds harsh, but they really were. The meat was tough, the sauce tasted like something you'd buy in a can from a dollar store. They had to be frozen and not fresh, that's how bad they were. I'm sorry again, because I like this place, a lot! But they need to get their ribs right OR just get them off their menu all together, because in a city of Cleveland, you can't FAKE good ribs, let along great ribs. Come on Wexler's, you're better than this!"}
{"text":"Ganster of love. gangster. gangster.  Shotgun gangster.  Where is spring? Cordon Bleu and fries  when sports screens attack"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with any food I have gotten here. The ribs are amazing! I got the chipotle burger today. Perfectly cooked and spicy as promised! Great atmosphere and great place for Sunday football games with great specials! You so t be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Place was very clean, I got the mushroom burger,; very filling.  Hubs got the Giant Gyro very filling and the fries were the best!!  Parking was a little than less desirable.. but nothing you can do about that.  Food was better than average.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Wexler's Tavern is a solid middle-of-the-road neighborhood bar and grill in every sense of the genre. It's tucked away in Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood in an area that's a mix of old and new, residential and commercial, basically, exactly what you'd expect from a Cleveland joint like Wexlers. I don't know the history but I'd venture to guess they've been serving the locals for decades.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by the gentleman behind the bar. Sit wherever you want. The decor has that worn-in, comfortable feeling, like somewhere you've never been before but somewhere you've been a hundred times before. A small bar, tables to the right, jukebox, big, bricked wall with a fireplace in the rear, bright light streaming in from a skylight in the center of the ceiling. I doubt they've changed the place much...ever. I guess if it's working for them why monkey with it, right?  I've seen others complain about the service, but our experience was very good. She was instantly on top of things, taking our drink orders within minutes of our sitting down, knew the menu and the beer list well, and checked in with us just the right number of times. I honestly don't have any complaints about the service at all.  The beer list at Wexler's was surprisingly good. I tend to temper my beer expectations when I go to places like this - I get it, craft beer isn't their thing - but when I saw 8 taps  and a bottled list that numbered just north of 50 selections (OK, maybe around 20 decent beers amidst the typical macro beer you'd expect) I was sure I'd be able to find something. And I did. Unfortunately, our server informed me that they were out of most of the bottles, but I'll chalk it up to the fact that it was the day after St. Patricks Day. There were a couple of missteps in the beer service side of things, but I won't dwell on them.  The food is definitely a step above typical bar fare and their menu is pretty expansive for your a small neighborhood tavern and eatery. Salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizza and house specialties like ribs, gyros and stir fry. I'm tellin' ya, you'll find something that you'll eat here. Trust me. We started with the house dinner salad and fried mushrooms. The salad was a mix of iceberg and mixed greens topped with shredded mozz, a couple slices of cuke and tomato and pepperoncini.  The fried mushrooms were very tasty. We polished off the basket pretty quickly.  For our meal we both went the sandwich route. I went for the corned beef Reuben and my other half had the chicken Philly cheeseteak. The Reuben was pretty good. I couldn't help but compare it to Slyman's, which is in no way fare, but I couldn't help myself. It could have used more meat and the corned beef was sliced a bit thick. The accompanying fries were delicious. My wife really liked the cheesesteak with its soft, multigrain bun (nice touch) and perfectly cooked yellow peppers and tender chicken. Nice cole slaw, too.   It was good and better than we expected. I guess when you're trying a new neighborhood spot that's about all you can ask for, right? Good service, good food,  good atmosphere. It probably won't blow your mind but it'll fill your belly and leave you with some change in your wallet after. Support local and dine at places like Wexler's."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere - love going here for fish fry this time of year!"}
{"text":"Chef Steve is the man!!! Food was amazing from start to finish.   Egg roll was perfect.  Is recommend the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Cleveland jem!!! My boys helped me with a REALLY difficult task and I took them out to lunch here and very much enjoyed the experience! Maybe it was the 12 dogs of Christmas that helped?"}
{"text":"This was a great local bar, great bar food. The burgers that we had were good. The service was really good places clean very friendly definitely a place to check out"}
{"text":"It doesn't look very good from the outside and it is slightly better from the inside.  In a few words It's an old dive bar with a face lift. There's no beer list, the bar maid was friendly, the garlic parmesan tots were awesome. The meat ball sub was mediocre at best.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich was tough and tasted like plastic almost certainly microwaved.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a great find!!   We only came here because we bought a Groupon, but what a great find!!   Nice corner bar - good selection of beer  The trivia guy is great too!!!"}
{"text":"Found a deal on Amazon and decided to try it out. The food was great - the spicy garlic bbq wings were incredible (I ended up dipping my hot wings in the sauce bc it was so good) and the pierogies were nice and fat. I got the Dominator Burger which was cooked perfectly at medium rare (as was my eating companion's tavern burger, though she complained that her buns had a slightly larger circumference than her burger) and the bbq pulled pork topping was audaciously flavorful. I personally liked the fries which were different (think Five Guys fries but thicker and with less salt). The place itself looks like what I imagined a Cleveland bar would look like (the Drew Carey Show bar being my only point of reference). There were a number of drunk women at the bar (it was 10pm on a Saturday when we arrived), and one of them was really loud and obnoxious and apparently hated her name, but it was cool since it was so late so we didn't mind. She was really, really loud though. The wait staff was exceedingly friendly and solicitous. Prices were great. Free refills on sodas. Lastly, the urinals in the men's rooms were at a strangely high height -- I think someone 5'5\" or below would have trouble reaching - but at my height, I found it gave me a surprisingly cool and comfortable place to rest my testicles whilst urinating. 5/5 - would go again, but I will likely never have a reason to go back to Cleveland :("}
{"text":"God, havn't been here in years!  Used to come here and the Jigsaw when they were in my rotation.  Still the same corner bar which I love.  Still have a diverse menu.  Escargot and peanut butter jelly melt anyone?  Pretty decent beer selection but the beer lines could use a cleaning.  Girls working were friendly and took our Groupon with no problem.  One thing that DID stand out is the pierogi.  Seriously, the best Ive had in a long time.  Most places get em from the same 10 spots in Cleveland that sell em wholesale but they way they do these is great.  I asked the server where they got em and got a look...you would of thought I asked her to cream corn wrestle or something.  Cream corn Thunderdome, baby..."}
{"text":"Called to order a to go buffalo chicken salad, asked if grilled chicken could be subbed for fried chicken. 25 minute wait. Walked up there and it was $2 more expensive than anticipated, inquired about the receipt saying a charge for a side salad and was told there is a $2 upcharge for grilled chicken. Told them I wasn't told that during the order and wasn't paying for it/did not want it at that price. Could have easily been told to me at the time of ordering......not only a ridiculous upcharge for essentially the same exact ingredient (especially considering their steak salad would have been cheaper) but just one of many examples of how the service of Wexlers has quickly gone downhill in the passing months."}
{"text":"Advertised open till 11pm , called to verify they accept the Groupon they offer on a Sunday night. Showed up at 7:30 pm. Front door locked, people coming out back door said you enter that way. We went in and was greeted by a man who said yes the dining room was open. We sat , he walked back over and gave us menus . Lights were off in dining room section and we were sitting in the dark. The man after started telling us no groupons after closing ?? And when he walked away he threw a handful of menus in the air behind us! This man wreaked of liquor and having our 12 year old son with us we decided to get up and leave. It was obvious he was watching the football games and drinking with the only 2 people at end of bar also watching football.  After reading reviews we though we were going to find a great new little spot. I hope this is not the norm for this place. We will not go back and requested refund from Groupon ."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon for this place. It's just a bar. I thought it was a restaurant. Just the kind of food you would expect here.  The Philly Cheese Steak is made with real steak. I enjoyed it. Cheese sticks and marinara were good too. Not a must have but good in a pinch. The woman working here was nice as ever. I think her name was Joy."}
{"text":"We used a groupon and left very pleased. The perogies were great, and so were our gyro and chicken philly meals. Lots of flavor. There was no dessert menu but we found out they had cheesecake and man, that did not disappoint. Our server Joy was great too. Very personable and attentive. We would come back if we were in the area and had a Groupon."}
{"text":"As a tyke, I had seen lines out the door for this place, which recently reopened after being closed since at least I started drinking. Newer and nicer decor than a dive bar. There's a brick fireplace and a big black/white illustration of an Al Capone-like figure with a Stogie in his mouth over the bar.   I was here twice on Saturday but with nearly opposite experiences.  My first stop in the afternoon, my sister, her friend and I wanted a quick shot while riding bikes. Walking up to the bar, my sister orders shots of pineapple upside down cake for the three of us. A lady behind the bar joked whether we wanted someone else to make the shots. At least she was honest. We watched her for 10 minutes as she inquisitively looked for the ingredients and make the d-r-i-n-k..   Later in the night, I came by for the Pedal for Prizes after-party. Top40 music played faintly in the background as not to disrupt conversation as we caught up with our days' experiences. Service that night was solid at the bar and at the tables. There's 3 taps: Guinness, PBR, and Bass. $4.50 for a tall Bass, PBR only $1 [might have been a special that night].   There's also a full food menu (nearly all items under $10) and open for lunch.   (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, I'll round up to 3 and give them a benefit of the doubt.  I'll try it again."}
{"text":"This place is about a mile from our house. We have never been here, looks like a nice local bar, once we got inside it was a great atmosphere, it was very clean to include the restrooms. The bartender/waiter that night was named Matt, he was very nice and very informative. All of our food was more than what we expected, The food was awesome,  very tasty and well-prepared. I personally went and thanked the chef for a good job and left a tip for him to buy beer that night. We decided that this will now be our local dining spot. See you guys again soon"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restuarant. The burgers here were amazing! Especially the tavern burger (my personal favorite). If you want a great burger, make a stop here. They were out of potato skins when we were there which was a bit of a let down but the amazing burger definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"Spent today enjoying the Browns history making, NFL record breaking on the road comeback at a 'True' neighborhood establishment. Although not from the 'hood (far from it by 30 mi) it was well worth my time getting there.   Although they serve 'bar food' they  do have homemade chilli that should be tried. Also my friend Adam had their Manhattan Clam Chowder that he raved about.  Enjoyed the day and will be back again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here.  This time I stopped by for a beer but no food, this seemed to annoy the bartender a little bit, but overall she was nice.  They have a burger special on Mondays that is great value.  Their tap beer choices are fairly limited but they make up for that with many bottle/can choices. One major complaint....the place always smells like toilet.  Like sitting on a picnic table behind a row of porta potties.  The smell definitely decreases my appetite."}
{"text":"They have a solid menu of bar food that is sure to please everyone. The black bean burger is great and their potato skins and other items are all way above average. They have a good selection of tap beers and some of the best wings i've ever had.   There is plenty of seating and bar room as well. The bar tenders have always been friendly and the bar is never too crowded. My new neighborhood favorite where i know i can get some damn good food cheap."}
{"text":"Burger specials today for $5.50. Got the Tavern burger w fried egg and Fries. Bartender/waitress was great. I was one of the only people in there at the time. They had wi fi so I was able to get through some house flipping biz work done. The burger and fries were great, generous portions also. I will have to come back again for their daily price specials."}
