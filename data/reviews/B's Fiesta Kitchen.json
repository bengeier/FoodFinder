{"text":"Called in an order to go for 2 ready in 10 minutes.  Got home and our meal was wonderful.  Very delicious and will be going over to enjoy other items on their menu.  We ordered 2 blue corn enchiladas, yummy."}
{"text":"With only a week open, the customer service is second to none. Although, i haven't tried their new menu.....just a few drinks at the full bar and I'm sold...I'm sure this is the next best joint for our local area."}
{"text":"Came in from San Diego and found this neat little hideaway called B's Fiesta Kitchen. Had a blast! Food was great! Drinks were great! The Bartender name Dusty was so inviting! I will be back"}
{"text":"We had a group of over 20 surprise them on a Saturday afternoon after horse back riding. Hungry and thirsty,.. we felt very welcomed and they had reinforcements come in to take excellent care of us. The food was great and the service was even better!!"}
{"text":"The Tacos Dorados and Lili's rice were great.  Super service.  This will definitely be a repeat dinner for us.  Nice atmosphere and family friendly."}
{"text":"Went  for the first time at lunch today.  Service  and  food were excellent.  They have a nice big bar for happy hours  . Had chicken tacos , bean dip and chile verde  soup.  The chips were hot and the dip had a little smokey aftertaste to it . Have  not had that before,  very  tasty. The tacos were nice and crispy and cheesy. The soup had a nice little kick  to it and  but not where you were sweating to death.  The  only reason I gave 4 stars  is because I  think they are a little overpriced for this type of food.  But  I  will definitely go back. Support your local restaurants.

{"text":"My son and I came here after a game to eat dinner.  We had eaten here for the last 2 or 3 Mexican restaurants in this location and were happy every time.  This time, not so much.  We came it and from across the room were told to \"sit anywhere\".  We sat down and a very nice young lady came by and took our drink order...water and root beer.  She returned with the drinks and chips and salsa.  The chips were cold and stale and the salsa, acciording to my son, :tastes like Pace from Costco\".  We ordered, My son ordered Tacos Dorado with mexican slaw and beans.  I asked about the Mexican Pizza and was told \"lots of people order it\".  I asked about the sides and was told I got one hot and one cold-this is important later-I ordered the beans and Mexican slaw.  I ordered the pizza with ground beef.  She came back to ask my son what he wanted in his tacos-he ordered ground beef as well.  The food came out very fast.  I got the slaw and asked about the beans and was told -\"only he got them\".  His tacos were too hot to eat, like they had been microwaved.  The first 2 pieces of pizza I tried to lift broke apart and the one I could lift was cold.  When the waitress came by to check on us I asked her to just take it back..  She offered a new one, but it came out so fast I can't believe it \"sat too long\".  The staff was very nice but I did not see the food getting any better.  The owner or manager came by and I explained the situation.  She offered something else, but again I declined and they said they would take it off my bill.  They left the slaw when they took my plate.  My son loved it and I did not see any reason why he shouldn't have it if they left it.  Boy was I wrong.  They charged me $2.95 for a side of slaw...almost 1/3rd of the cost of the meal I sent back.  I didn't ask them to leave it, I asked to have the meal removed.  I should have known better.  We were trying to decide how to rate this and were at a 2.5 or 3.  Good service, mediocre food costing more than it should.  After that incident, we were trying to decide if it should be as high as a 2.."}
{"text":"Driving home from Basha's last week, I was excited to see a banner hoisted up with a colorful \"B's Fiesta Kitchen\" emblazoned on it. I ran home, picked up the Mrs and made a B-line for their front doors.

We were greeted at the door by the owners Steve & Beth. Extremely pleasant people and really made you feel welcome. There weren't very many there as I'm sure word needs to spread on this gem.

The place is very casual with a nice (full) bar and plenty of seating. TVs situated around the place with all of the good games on! Staff are very friendly and we had chips and salsa upon sitting down. Soon the beer and margaritas were flowing. Definite happy hour spot!!! Seriously!!

I ordered the Blue Corn Enchiladas. They come stacked with all of the goodies in between. Chicken (or beef), red or green chili verde, cheese & beans all worked together and to top it all off, a fried egg cooked your way rests atop the masterpiece. I can't begin to describe how GOOD this was! You have got to try this! OH! Almost forgot- The Mexican coleslaw is to die for! The chipotle flavor really kicks ya in the pants! Don't pass this side up!

My wife ordered an appetizer. It was a spinach tortilla with a spicy chicken mixture and sprinkled with cotija cheese. A little guac and cream cheese set if off just right.

Seriously folks, if you're in the neighborhood, give B's Fiesta Kitchen try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"b's? More like blow-j's! Mediocre food. Tasted microwaved.  Way overpriced and service is minimal at most. I miss Matta's philly cheese steak burrito"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like the New Mexican restaurant where two others had failed. Over priced, I had the bison chili for $12.95 and had great expectations. Lacking favor and not worth the price. With so many authentic Mexican restaurants nearby I'm afraid this place will not survive the test of time."}
{"text":"Love the food each time we go! Very good salsa. Had the chili relleno and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar / restaurant! The regulars are all very friendly. The owners are here a lot and are very nice and approachable. Tara who serves and sometimes bartends is a rock star!

Menu is limited but the food good. They have some solid choices that they kill! Nopales are amazing. Fried tacos - yum! Great beer selection and an amazingly stocked bar."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the counterfeit reviews claiming five stars. The food is overpriced, portions small and the carne asada burrito was inedible. The salsa tasted like picante from a grocery store shelf. We tried this place because of the short distance from our house. Now I understand why there was no one there at dinner time except for the local bar patrons."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in last night. The owners are friendly. Staff was very attentive. Nice atmosphere. The food was delicious! My husband had the blue corn enchiladas and I had B's special.
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally a good Mexican restaurant in the north east Mesa area,  located at Ellsworth and Brown Road. My friend and I just enjoyed dinner at B's Fiesta  Kitchen.   We Highly recommend the Tacos Dorado stuffed with the most delicious shredded beef, the Chicken Enchilada Christmas style, and Chili Relleno. We can't wait to try their green chili pork.  (You can only eat so much in a meal) 
Delicious Mexican food at very reasonable prices located in the north east Mesa area...it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"I attended a birthday party here with 25 people.  They did a great job serving all of us.  Food was good.  The owners even came in to help.  Love supporting locally owned and operated small business!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  This is usually our last stop of the night place. Friendly neighborhood bar where everyone knows each other. Tara is the BEST but watch out for her Jello shots. Steve and Beth (the owners) treat every customer like family. We just love this place!"}
{"text":"Casual place with a very large, impressively stocked bar.  They have several Mexican imports on tap.  The menu is small but offers a nice selection.

I like the food!  I have no problem adding this place to my very small list of restaurants close to home that serve a decent meal.

Service was friendly and made the best of an obviously understaffed & busy dinner rush.  

We will return"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch today there. I got the tacos with rice and beans and the food was fantastic. The staff were very friendly and quick. I was happy with the prices and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to B's Fiesta kitchen Saturday evening for the first time. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and the food, awesome. Had the tilapia tacos with Mexican coleslaw, so good the fish was excellent and they put a different spin on the coleslaw that won me over. My wife had plobano peppers stuffed which she said were great. Prices good, and also good drinks from the bar. People of apache junction check them out, finally a good restaurant near AJ."}
{"text":"This place has good food and legit happy hour! The staff is really friendly and I love how close it is to my house. My husband and I are always looking for great happy hour spots. The one thing that really sucks about this place is that there is no TACO TUESDAY!!! I don't understand why the owner wouldn't have a taco Tuesday. This place has potential to be rockin if they would just do TACO TUESDAY! Should be a no brainer right?!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple times love the bar I live across the street and I just don't understand why there is no Taco Tuesday it would create a lot of business hopefully they can figure it out Happy Hour is awesome all we need is some awesome street tacos on Tuesd"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food and good prices! Tara helped us and she was more than helpful! Their happy hour has really good prices too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small corner restaurant tucked into the back strip mall next to Basha's. Order was placed 'to go' and the service was mediocre given that the place was not busy for a Friday evening. Seems this may be a better local bar joint given the large bar taking up half of the restaurant. Anyway, ordered the fajita burrito with steak chimichanga, enchilada style with red sauce. The menu was fairly small, mostly burritos, tacos, and breakfast combinations (from the pictures posted on Yelp). Down side is I could not locate a website for this restaurant to get a better menu. The burrito was large and filled with a good ratio of onions and peppers to meat. The meat was tender and good quality steak. The burrito was also stuffed with fresh guacamole. I was impressed that the red enchilada sauce tasted fresh made. It also had a mild smoky flavor that was different and really flavorful. Our order also came with chips and salsa to go. The salsa was really chunky and mild, but it was flavorful but not addictive.

It was good for an easy pick up dinner on the way to my friend's house for a sleepover. I wouldn't drive out of my way to try it, but, if I were in the area again, with a craving for an enchilada style chimichanga, I would probably order again. I'm giving a 4 star for the quality of the ingredients and the overall freshness of flavor."}
{"text":"We were really hoping this would be a good Mexican place after two others failed at this location.  The restaurant is very clean & the wait staff friendly.  

For what you get, the plates are priced too high.  My wife ordered a steak tostada salad & it only had steak & lettuce, no beans and rice as most tostada salads have. While it was tasty, it needed something more to make it worth going back.  

Probably will try one more time but with so many other Mexican restaurants, it won't be our first choice."}
{"text":"Tried B's for the first time today.  It was early on Sunday afternoon so a large crowd was not an issue.  Of course the service was very attentive due to the time of day.  However I would like to add it was genuine which means a lot.  The menu is a little small for mexican food but I easily could have picked at least a half dozen items.  I went with their specialty Blue Corn Chicken enchiladas.  My wife who does not like cheese had a more difficult time but chose the carne asada burrito. They also have a rice side that is more than your typical spanish rice of which we both ordered.  Our meals had great flavor and were well portioned.  If I had to give a negative it would be the fact, there was too much sauce on my enchiladas for my liking.   Chips and salsa were complimentary and average quality.  They have a full bar menu including some craft beers.  If you like mexican food and like to live outside the box you should at least give B's a try."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon B's Fiesta Kitchen when looking for a place to eat and seeing that it was the closest restaurant to me. I saw that it had some good reviews and after dining there I realized that they were warranted. Our waitress Julie was very kind and accommodating while pointing out specials on the menu for us first timers. The atmosphere as a whole was very lively with classic tunes and tvs around the bar. The food was excellent but the best part was probably the fresh in-house salsa I got to munch on before my meal arrived. All in all it was a good meal and a good experience that was fairly priced."}
{"text":"We found B's by accident. And by accident, I mean finding a horrible Chinese restaurant nearby and coming upon this Mexican spot in the same retail complex while in mourning. B's Fiesta Kitchen is at the north end of the complex, next to Leslie's Pool Supply.

The interior is quaint and open, with minimal decor, but good tunes. There is a large bar at the southern end of the restaurant. The interior temperature is comfortable, at least prior to nopalitos!

The menu is not vast, but contains some great items. We have been almost daily since we found B's, and have tried many of the items. Many places do not serve nopales/nopalitos/cactus. B's is spicy, but amazing! It reminded us of the nopales found in Los Angeles in Olvera Street. My husband sweats like a beast when he eats them. It's hilarious, but he keeps eating! Huevos con nopalitos are well-deserved, with just the right heat. Refried beans are tasty and have a great texture. We also really enjoy the Tacos Dorados (I prefer the chicken - marinated to perfection and served with what appears to be Oaxaca cheese. My husband has found a staple in the Tacos Pescados. The fish is lightly battered and fried. The Blue Corn Enchiladas are also worth a try. Order your eggs sunny, and get some extra tortillas!

The sopapillas. Let's just say that my husband said \"holy Santa Clause shit!) when he tried them. Light, soft pastry with tons of butter and light honey syrup make these the best we've had.

Let's talk service. The first time we went in, Tara sat down and went over the menu with us, taking into consideration our likes, dislikes and expectations. She was right on with her suggestions, and is super friendly and personable, while maintaining professionalism and great service. She was genuinely concerned with our happiness during our visit. We have now visited pretty much every day. We have met Beth and Steve, the owners, Dusty at the bar, and Tara's daughter Jamie, who serves on Fridays. We also thought it was cool that Chef Manny and his son cook at B's, truly making it a family affair. The staff knows our names after just a few visits. We brought our own family in, and recommend B's to everyone. We found a new pal in Tara too, so, bonus! 

Thank you to everyone who makes our dining a great experience. People, try it! But save some nopalitos for us!"}
{"text":"Excellent made from scratch food and super friendly staff.  The queso is amazing!  The salsa is excellent too!"}
{"text":"The waitress was pleasant and attentive, but she wasn't very familiar with the menu and she didn't know what kinds of beer they had (should have a beer menu).  The owner (I think) came around, said hello and asked everyone how they liked their food, but he seemed like he was quickly going through the motions and not really wanting serious answers.

My beer wasn't very cold, which might be OK for some, but not me.  

The salsa was good, but the chips were skimpy. However, we were told upfront that we could have as much chips and salsa as we wanted, and we could even take some home if we wanted so that was nice.  

We ordered a carne asada burrito and a chicken quesadilla.  The carne asada tasted like it was boiled instead of grilled.  While the rice had a good flavor, it was rather dry and hard.  The side of pinto beans lacked flavor, and the guacamole had too much cilantro (or something like that).  The sour cream wasn't watered down like some places which was a plus.

The quesadilla needed to be grilled; 'as is' the insides didn't meld together and it was hard to eat without falling apart.  The chicken had a good flavor, but the spinach was not a good compliment, and the insides were not disbursed equally throughout (some bites were OK, others not so much).  For the price ($12.25), I think it should have come with rice and beans.

Overall, nothing to write home about.  We were excited to try this new place, but we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've never had to salt my food at a Mexican restaurant, but I guess there's a first time for everything.  Overpriced food, watered down margaritas.  Seems like this location must be cursed since the last restaurant that resided here was just as gross."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today with my wife. After eating here once, this will be our new go-to spot! I got the shredded green chili burrito. Fantastic! Make sure you get it enchilada style, with the incredible green sauce on top! It has a nice slow burn and has a very unique flavor. And it's not watered down, has some nice texture to it. My wife got the blue corn shredded chicken enchiladas and she was thrilled. I tried a bite and was blown away. B is very friendly and nice. This place is off the hook!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and the food was excellent!! The wife had the chicken burrito and said it was delicious! I had the blue corn enchiladas with the fried egg on top. Duhhhaaammmm. This dish with spicy green sauce was so good. Had the Mexican coleslaw and a corn dish as my sides. The corn dish was also pretty tasty. Glad this place is open again. New owners were accessible and super friendly. This will be our new goto neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Super friendly great service, but the stuffed pabalano pepper was under cooked and one of the side so hot was not able to eat it.  Think with a little work it could a a good place to go but a little over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is really close to us and we were excited that a new Mexican restaurant opened after Matta's closed. The restaurant itself is nice and clean and new. They give complimentary chips and salsa once you order. The chips were cold and tasted stale. The salsa didn't taste like it was freshly made, more like it was from a store. We both ordered the carne asada burritos. They didn't have chimichangas on the menu so we had to order them deep fried (extra charge) with sour cream (extra charge) rice and beans (extra charge) red sauce (extra charge)... The burritos were very small and it was more rice in the burrito than anything else. The sour cream ($1.25) was served in a 2 ounce plastic cup. The carne asada had decent flavor but there wasn't much of it inside. The beans were flavorful. The rice was OK, but I got some hard chunks of old rice that had clearly been sitting for a while. We finished our meals because we were hungry, but decided while we were eating that we wouldn't be back. That decision was solidified when we got the bill... It was over $35 before the tip. Way over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"TARA. TARA. TARA. I can't say enough about this chick. She totally turned my experience here around. She is Friendly. Witty. Welcoming. Brings every single thing that was missing to B's table. Tara is a huge asset to your team and will be the reason I keep coming back for more. And her margaritas. Seriously, muy deliciouso (or something like that)!"}
{"text":"Give it a try! Machaca tacos are crisp and flavorful  with that homemade thin type shell, tilapia tacos are excellent, red salsa has a kick but the green has a wallop! First batch of chips were cold but the rest came out warm n yummy . Can't say enough about the coleslaw ( do it !) oh, very nice people too :-)"}
{"text":"Great little place for a good lunch.  We ordered from the lunch specials menu and had tacos and a machaca burrito - both excellent. And some of the best salsa for chip-dipping that I've ever had. We were waited on by B herself who was friendly and helpful and even brought out a sample of nopales for us to try. Very good!"}
{"text":"I don't know that this was much better than the last place. The food was ok and the staff was ok. I think if you were the one \"regular\" who was in there that the whole waitstaff sat down to talk to then you'd consider the place fantastic. I doubt we will ever go back again. Too bad...we are always looking for a great neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Tasteless and overpriced! My carne asada burrito was made with what tasted like pot roast and old brown guacamole. Small portions and not worth the price"}
{"text":"Decided to try Fiesta Kitchen for an early dinner tonight.  Friendly and great service.  Menu is limited but the food is good. Loved the blue corn enchiladas and margaritas. 

Reviews were excellent and I can tell you correct.  The place is very casual with a nice bar and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Decided to try Fiesta Kitchen fur an early dinner tonight.   Reviews were excellent and I can tell you correct. We loved it all and will definitely be back. Friendly and great service. Loved the fried tacos and hubby blue corn enchiladas with fried egg. Sopapillas are to die for, the best we have ever had"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was spectacular. 

I just got done with the salt river and a large group of ours went to refill and drink lots of water. Our server was absolutely amazing, never ran out of water or chips and was the perfect amount of friendly without being bothersome. 

If you find yourself craving Mexican food before or after the river, or just because, go here."}
{"text":"Beyond disgusting. Bad flavors, uninspired menu, taco not worthy of Taco Bell. Spoiled cheese. A waitress who lacked even the most basic knowledge and who has never tasted a single menu item. Brought my 3 item combo minus the third item. I had to catch her attention only for her to say \"oh yeah I thought something was missing when I picked it up in the kitchen. I'll get it for you now.\" These guys won't last long. Don't go by the phony Yelp reviews."}
