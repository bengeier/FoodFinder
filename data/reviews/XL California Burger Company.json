{"text":"Love the burgers! The fries are amazing too, they're not just salty, they have some seasoning! I love getting a bacon cheese burger with fries, I also get some of their awesome ranch for my fries! Sometimes I only stop by for their breakfast plates, they're really good too! Scramble eggs, toast, and some bacon!!!
Place is always clean and their service is quick, not as fast as some other places, but I can't complain because the food is always great."}
{"text":"Food is good when you don't have to wait for 20 minutes for your orders and then not done correct and threw drive threw I've gone there several times customer service getting worse every time the point of having drive through is to have your orders  done in a good time mater to get back on the road."}
{"text":"Just left from the drive thru, and it was probably the best double bacon cheeseburger I have ever had, and the fries portion was so large, I thought it was a double order. I will definitely be going back and telling my friends about it. Great friendly service too"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool ya!!
They have a lot more going on then just burgers. 

I got me the gyro and it was great.
I was hesitant on eating at a place with so many things on there menu as places like that tend to make so many different things mediocre and can't make one thing great!"}
{"text":"The outside and surrounding area seems a little sketch but I am glad we came in. Super friendly, clean and the food is freaking fantastic. Great price. Everything is made from scratch. We will definitely be back. New weekend breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The food is great and customer service is even better. They make you feel so welcome. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious...whenever you get it. They constantly mess up your order, always out of brownies (their cookies are stale), then use Grubhub to deliver, which sucks even more when they mess up your order. The driver can't just go back to fix it, the order has to be reentered and you'll be charged another delivery fee.

I gave XL California Burger multiple opportunities to change my mind about them. They failed every single time. Everything from missing items, to receiving smaller sizes than ordered/paid for.

The order that made me write this review was simple in nature but they found a way to lose a customer. I ordered a veggie teriyaki burger meal (fries and a 24oz drink), a 32oz horchata, onion rings, and a brownie. Upon delivery, I discovered my order was short the fries, stale cookies instead of a brownie, and a 24oz horchata. I went through Grubhub and the restaurant to attempt to fix this. Grubhub did their usual $10 credit but the restaurant insisted that they put fries in the bag.

I don't know if they are so overwhelmed to keep up with the demand but between their customer service and relationship with Grubhub, I won't use either of them again."}
{"text":"For quality and value you can't beat this nice clean eating establishment. I had their breakfast special and it was super good at a great price. The added bonus is the great service provided by the staff. I highly recommend this establishment for all the reasons stated above. They also have a great menu."}
{"text":"Just walked on on a whim and glad I did. Ordered the double cheeseburger plain an fries. Huge portion and wonderful taste cool 50 s memorabilia and kinda cool spot."}
{"text":"OMG, I haven't had a good Pastrami (a real) sandwich like this in years until today!!!
The sandwich is much better than the picture shows.
AND..... The onions rings, WOW!!! Yummm.
The portions are VERY large and worth EVERY penny!!!
If you leave hungry; there is something wrong with you.

Not to mention the Ranch dressing, soooo yummy; you'll never find a dressing like that in the grocery stores.

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and can thank Uber Eats as I didn't know they existed until today.

Thank you very much!!
Sincerely, HAPPY"}
{"text":"Nasty .. 8.00 for some sorry ass nachos with cheese from a can ,,, I even asked for real cheese (shredded ) some sliced hamburger cheese ,,, never again"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and fish and chips through Grubhub and the order took over one and a half hours...HOURS...to arrive. I thought of refusing the order but my dog got out and I had to chase her...I digress.  The food was cold, the fries were droopy, the fish was grease soaked and the onion rings were overfried.  I don't know who to blame for the length of the delivery, but the food was awful as well. Nobody wins here."}
{"text":"I saw the paid placement on Yelp at the top of my results and wanted to give this place a shot because it seemed like a local small business owner trying his or her hardest.

When I walked in, the cashier walked me through the menu and was undoubtedly trained well by the management to tout the various offerings that are \"cut in house\" and \"made from scratch\". However, it seems like the management and staff are placing emphasis on the wrong areas. 

1. If you truly do make all the sauces in house, why are they being refrigerated (thus killing all of the flavor and imparting a low-brow aesthetic to the whole experience)? I'd rather have a \"distributor\" condiment, served at the correct temperature, and replenished more frequently in smaller batches, than homemade BBQ sauce out of a refrigerator.

2. If you have taken the initiative to make all of the sauces in house, why are the fries from a distributor and not hand-cut? I'd rather have house-cut fries with a distributor sauce than vice-versa. Additionally, I don't know if this is a cooking oil problem (temperature, freshness, mix of things made in the same oil, etc.), but the fries had a bland grey-ish hue, rather than the golden/tan brown you'd see in other restaurants serving flash-fried fries. (See Lenny's for example, which uses \"distributor\" fries, but does them well.) The fries were also kind of dense and crumbly in an unappealing way.

3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, for $8, why is the charbroiled chicken sandwich *not* cooked to order? What is the point of having the facility there if the customer is given the entree long after it is prepared? I arrived before 11 am--which would seem an ideal time to get something grilled to order--and the chicken sandwich came to the counter roughly 2 minutes after I ordered it (indicating it was pre-cooked, as a raw chicken breast takes 8-12 minutes to grill over flame), was clearly not grilled to order, and was lukewarm. The chicken breast, like the fries, also had a grey and 'abraded' look to it, and was also dense and crumbly. There are plenty of places around the Valley that grill chicken breast to order at the $8 price point. It just seems a shame that a place that prides itself on having so much of the menu \"made in house\" would have so many issues in putting it together. I've honestly had a more aesthetic, and perhaps fresher, chicken sandwich at McDonald's--and for less than $8.

I might go back in 2-3 months and try breakfast, but it seems like this is not a lunch place, despite the name."}
{"text":"Never never order a pastrami sandwich it's soooo fucking dry old never never again thanks"}
{"text":"Best customer service and so many options.  Great food! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks. I got the King Kong and everything on it was cheap. It was made with a fake meat and old vegetables. My wife got a carne asada burrito with rice and beans and it was all process food that could be bought at any cheap store and it was horrible. Stay clear of this place. My kids could make better food then this place. I would have given this place no stars but 1 is the lowest"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to XL California Burger Company and I'm glad we came. At first glance this place looks run down, but that's a part of the aesthetic. Retro seating looks outdated but adds to the overall feel of the restaurant. The food is all we came for though and we were not disappointed; we ordered two cheeseburgers, a large order of friend zucchini and a small order of chili cheese fries. It was all amazing, we could not finish our meal and ended up taking home most of the fries and zucchini. The chili is excellent and has a slight kick to it. The fried zucchini is amazing and the burgers were incredible as well. I'll make sure to come back to this establishment to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Purely Awesomeness Excellent Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner!!!!Very nice customer service and a awesome cook I love this place"}
{"text":"Walked in.
Place smelled like sewer.
Although the cashier was friendly and greeted us kindly, I didn't feel comfortable with him being in the restroom for 20 minutes at the most, I didn't want him touching our food since he'd been in the restroom so long,  well I didn't complain, he gave me our food which was 'eh alright'
we were in the middle of our meal when that same kind cashiers who had greeted us nicely starts mopping the floor with FABULOSO (mexican cleaning product) OMG!!! My stomach just starting feeling sick, I felt like I was eating the cleaning product, I couldn't take it, but the Cashier was so nice I didn't know how to tell him that what he was doing STUNK!! 
So I threw away my half eaten meal & stepped outside to get some air, I almost could've thrown up right outside the builing. 
Tables were sticky,  it was humid inside. 
Place needs new dining room furniture, furniture too old makes the place look sad."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place has such poor reviews; this place was awesome. It's a ton of food for super cheap. The staff were all friendly and the place was clean. 

I got a ribeye steak, eggs, hash browns, toast, a breakfast sandwich, and a soda for $11. 

They have breakfast all day and a diverse menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. You definitely get your money's worth! Husband says the Pozole is good. It was a huge portion.  I had the chilli cheese burger, chilli was not very good."}
{"text":"Maybe the cashier was having a bad morning but service was rude and not at all friendly.  Don't mind that they got my order wrong but when asking for correction the cashier gave me the worst look ever.  Would definitely never come here again."}
{"text":"The first time going it was bad customer service unprofessional ,prices on the menu are different than what they charge you. (Didn't notice the 1\" fine print subject to change and no refunds) ordered a  carne asada buritto ,I should just got a bean burro very lttle carne asada in it ,and the wings were microwaved."}
{"text":"Mushrooms are really good.  But 8.50 for a pastrami on rye? I feel abused at that price."}
{"text":"This place sucks poor fucking service there employees don't understand english. They mess up my order three times. Making food took forever waiting almost thirty minutes for my food. My burger wasn't good at all horrible food wings were over cooked. Poor customer service and food im not eating there no more and i will let everyone know too."}
{"text":"I came for the pancake breakfast and my husband got the cheeseburger special. It would've tasted a lot better but seems like the oil they used is very old! At first I thought it was the ketchup but it was actually the fries. The cheeseburger wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed going to this place for a quick lunch until today. The two women who worked the drive through where so unprofessional, rude, inefficient, and got my entire order wrong. Not to mention it took them so long to get it done. The larger woman of the two was rude beyond words. I'm never coming back. Very unpleasant."}
