{"text":"We were hungry and didn't want to wait for a table at Sushi House a few doors down.   Grilled duck breast ($8 for 5 thin slices): It was overdone so it was dry and a bit tough.   Katsu don ($10): The rice was too burnt on arrival and it tasted a bit too salty. There was a lot of rice and not a lot of chicken.   Raku roll ($13): Their signature roll was small. Inside was white fish, crab meat and cucumber. The spicy sauce was good. We could taste the torched flavour (aburi)."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The ramen is not bad, restaurant is pretty quiet, nice atmosphere for chatting. Sushi isn't bad eithe. Price is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I went in as a party of 6, half of us got our meals at a decent time. By the time the three of us were finished our meal, the other 3 meals did not even arrive yet. When we asked the waitress about it, she told us the kitchen didn't even start cooking the ramen. Absolutely terrible.  The food was sub par as well. I ordered the unagi rice. The portion was tiny for $14.50 and the sauce lacked flavour."}
{"text":"When Raku first opened I went there pretty often. They have a very modern space and service is really quick. Their fish was always fresh and their ramen was amazing.   But as time went by it started to go downhill from there. I've had broth that wasn't fully boiled and fish that was not fresh. I haven't been there in a while so I don't know how they are doing but hopefully they're still doing okay."}
{"text":"Raku is probably my go-to ramen place.. only because it is near and has a decent price and quality of ramen.   My order was the shoyu ramen. It came with sliced pork, egg, fishcake, corn, and bamboo shoots. The ramen is a 7.5/10 for me. The sliced pork is tender and the egg is perfectly cooked. But the soup and noodles itself were not at all hot. It was more \"luke warm\", which was disappointing. I guess it was okay if you wanted to eat it all right away without waiting for eat to cool down. I have been here around 3 times and have ordered sushi rolls everytime. EVERY SINGLE TIME I COME HERE, it takes around 40 MINUTES after we've already finished our ramen for our sushi rolls to come. And I usually only order 1 or 2. I always have to follow up twice for them to finally arrive. And this is ALL. THE. TIME. (Not just on one or two occassions). This was quite a disappointment for me.  The sushi rolls are OK.. just like any other Japanese sushi restaurant.   For one bowl of ramen, one california roll, and one green dragon roll, we paid about $35. Not bad but the wait for the sushi was just way too long."}
{"text":"-- Izakaya (Japanese for bar) without liquor License is a joke.  I heard they are in process of applying for one.  -- None of the skewers are avaliable during lunch hour. They are only avaliable for Dinner session only.   Waited 40 mins and my Katsu Pork (curry deep fried pork) is still missing in action.  I left the place in frustration.  Before we go I sampled Wife's Ramen. Well.. it Wife original order Veg Ramen, and Chicken Ramen came. The soup base was suppost to be Tonkotsu  (Pork), but it came out semi-warm with only very light trace of taste of pork. The funniest thing is the chicken, it's grill chicken breast (maple leaf food style) with no seasoning at all.  The noodle are soggy.  Worst Japanse Ramen I ever had.   I get much better value at Kinton Ramen for 10 bucks.   Not recommended at this point of their operation.  If you want Izakaya fix, I suggest the one at JTown if you are hunting for Izakaya experience in the Town of Markham.  If you are looking for Ramen, I suggest Kinton Ramen in Downtown Toronto.  Raku Ramen & Izakaya is good at either \"ramen\" or \"Izakaya\" experience that it is advertising in."}
{"text":"Ramen is always good. Better than Ajisen IMO. Sushi was nothing special. Rice dishes were also pretty tasty. The service is nice and the whole environment is welcoming. My new go to ramen place"}
{"text":"For the price I was paying I was expecting a decent bowl of ramen, what I got was not that. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and some sashimi. Most of the reviews here had mentioned about the bad service, however I didn't notice it at all. The service wasn't impressive but it wasn't bad either. The noodles were really eggy and the soup was creamy but didn't taste like tonkatsu. Appearance-wise it looked messy, like they just chucked the the toppings in it as the yolk of the onsen egg wasn't as appealing as most ramen places. The food was really mediocre."}
{"text":"Raku ramen is clean and friendly service. Their ramen menu for $12.50 is a good value and very tasty! I also always get their chicken or beef terriyaki on rice :) Totally would come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for ramen but ended up ordering 5 other apps. Lamb chops were very delicious and ramen was very tasty"}
{"text":"Came here cuz my friend was craving for ramen. Since it's a holiday Monday, parking was scarce but the restaurant was somewhat empty.  I had the miso ramen ($8) with a side of pork belly ($3-4) and it lacked flavour... Nothing exciting really. The place was clean, even the washroom. No complaints about service. But the food was SO mediocre, maybe the rest of the menu is better."}
{"text":"This place will not give you \"free edamame\" when you check-in to Yelp. I showed the server my Yelp check-in asking her if this applies, she said yes and she never gave me my free edamame.   Small restaurant, they do have 1 private room which can seat around 6-8 people.   Came here with 8 friends and grabbed a table right in the middle. Their menu is actually very small, which I did not expect. There is choice of ramen, sushi, sushi rolls, snacks. They do have feature dinner for 2 for $55 it looked pretty decent includes soup, sushi, hot stone bowl to name a few items, did not opt for it tho this time.   Food is mediocre, the fish does not taste fresh and to be honest some tasted a bit sour. I ordered the sushi set. It was around $13.   Service was mediocre as well, they did not give us enough menus for group of 8, I think we only had 3 to start with.  What is good is that they provided us with tea and salad for all of us once we got seated so we could eat something right away.   As well they accommodated our request to split the bills. :)"}
{"text":"The food size is on the small side,we both order a stone pot dish and end up sharing one more ramen lol. But sure the food is great,totally coming beck."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and ordered a lunch bento with teriyaki salmon.  The salmon was overcooked. The rest of the food (rice, salad, miso) wad as expected. The kappa Maki that came with it was a bit warm.  Overall, value was there but food was very unremarkable. Place is pretty modern and clean looking in comparison to the other strip mall restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place . The only good izzakaya I know uptown Markham .  recommended. Great service ."}
{"text":"We recently heard of this restaurant uptown so we decided to give it a try. As we went in, the décor was clean and modern and fairly bright and the waiters are really kind. Menus didn't really promote any of their ramens.   There was really limited choice for their ramens and the food from the sushi bar was also limited.   Ramens were decent with noodles being not really that chewy. The pork bone soup soup was not bad but was a bit too salty.   Sushi wasnt really all that great. ( Too big piece of rice)  Not too bad of a place for their soup noodles (ramen, udon) but would not solely go there for their sushi or sashimi.   Prob will go back for their ramens and might try their curry."}
{"text":"Give you tea and salad when you sit in. Then when you want tea again, don't think about it. Ordered unagi don and my unagi was burnt! And when I want to pay for the bill, they ignore me. Thinking that I want more tea or something. I had to stand up and serve myself."}
{"text":"First off, really great service with friendly and efficient staff. The ramen's portion was just right. The salmon fillet was fresh and the soup base has a hint of wasabi in it which is unique. Greatly recommend others to check out their ramen and stone bowl rice. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for a new place to try for lunch. My husband ordered the sushi combo and I had the curry beef brisket ramen which clearly did not disappoint. The beef was extremely tender and broth very flavourful. I will definitely return for this dish."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was pretty good. I ordered the pork belly ramen with cheese, while my mom got the black garlic tonkatsu ramen. The pork belly was really tender and almost melted in your mouth. The soup was quite good too; it was flavourful without being excessive. I wish they had put more cheese in the bowl though; there wasn't too much and it was all in one place. Some mouthfuls were just melted cheese, which would be good for a pizza joint, but not in a bowl of ramen. Had a positive experience overall and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkotsu ramen today, delicious and really enjoyed it, would come here again to try the rice bowls next time."}
{"text":"Surprised with the low reviews. We quite enjoyed this place considering the price and portions. The ramen was tender and soup was flavourful. I had the black garlic ramen. Bf recommends the spicy version. Service was also pretty decent on a busy Sunday night. Will return."}
{"text":"We had lot of food on this menu. The ramen was poor. The soup was not hot enough and the noodle was too soft. The sashimi was so so. The tuna was still a little frozen. The cut of the fish was way off. Large square to be exact. The skewer was not good either. It was kinda burn on the outside. The only thing was good was the service. Sorry but this just isn't up to a Japanese standard."}
{"text":"Need some good Japanese after a weekend in Buffalo NY. Discovered this restaurant. I had the pork ramen. Great soup full of pork flavor, noodles cooked perfectly. Portion on the small size for $8. My wife had the sushi combo. Fish is average but rice is cold. How can you serve cold  sushi rice, great sushi rice is served at room temperature. Just leave it out easy. I would go back because the menu has both good ramen and sushi options to keep everyone in the family happy. But please leave the rice out and get it to room temperature."}
{"text":"I always come back for ramen. If you're in Markham come to Raku first before going to Ajisen. Broth is on point and their spicy ramens are wicked. The rolls are solid too, a bit small for the price but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant, but like the other reviews say, it's definitely not really an izakaya. Too many families and toddlers at the joint for it to be called an izakaya.   They do have a drink list now, but our party did not drink. Options for the menu were a little limited, but enough.  It was good affordable food for the most part.   We ordered the pork ramen, jalapeño-scallop sashimi sushi, takoyaki, sweet potato fries and don katsu to share. Ramen had good flavour and noodles had just enough bite to them to be al dente. Portion was a little small for a typical ramen. Scallop sushi was really yummy, not too spicy and really fresh. The Takoyaki was the best part of the night, very crispy on the outside and squid was not too small. Fries and katsu were a bit of a disappointment from the size and didn't have as much flavour as the other stuff.   It's worth giving a try when you're not in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"The ramen was delicious overall. One of their specialities is the cold salmon ramen, which is a different twist to the traditional ramen. The beef skewers also melt in your mouth. If you book in advance, order over $50, and pay in cash, you get a free half pound of salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Raku Ramen is one of the many ramen places opened in Toronto within the last 2 years.  Raku Reamen is located in Markham, very convenience for people that live in Markham and hate travelling to downtown on a weekend just to have a ramen.  The ramen here is not the best, but for the price you pay (around $8), it's actually not bad.  I also had their beef rice before which I did not enjoy much because it tasted very plain.  So if you are planning to come here, I highly recommend you to stick with their ramen!  As for their sushi, I never tried them yet and is not planning to, because if i am going for sushi, i would rather go to the other actual sushi bar instead.  Between the ramen places uptown, i would rather go to Sanoya at FMP for a slightly higher price or the ramen place in Jtown."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this restaurant. I ordered the pork belly cheese ramen, it tasted good and very affordable, recommended it! The ginger pork with rice is so good!"}
{"text":"this is one of my favourite japanese restaurants for ramen. honestly their soup base and ramen is so nice like damn. it's not too salty, just the right amount for you to be content with. i usually get the spicy ramen which comes with your standard corn, black fungus, egg and pork belly (im actually quite upset with the fact that they don't add bamboo shoots to their ramen anymore because they were my absolute favourite:( )  a little word of advice, don't get their cheese ramen. don't get me wrong it was pretty good but they give you so little cheese ..it's not even funny like I expected a lot of cheese considering what it's called and for its price like come on   RIP raku ramen and izakaya. you will be missed dearly .. :'("}
{"text":"Their soup base is tasty. I had their special black garlic tonkotsu ramen, and the soup was not salty where I would get in other ramen places. I hoped they had more meat in the bowl though."}
{"text":"My mom and I weren't sure where to eat, so we came here, from close by and decided to try this out.  She had a decent rice bowl and I had a bowl of ramen.  Came with a typical, bland, unimpressive salad bowl.  Service and setting was fairly poor too, considering we saw cooks and employees yelling and going in and out.  Food was slow, fairly salty and overpriced for a simple bowl of ramen that wasn't too brilliant.  Noticed another table complaining about their food having a piece of plastic from the packaging!  All in all, there are better ramen stores around, but this is an option if anything."}
{"text":"For an uptown Ramen place, I'd say it's pretty good.  First, parking at this plaza is notoriously busy. But when I left at about 230p, it had plenty of space.  This is in the former wonton noodle soup location and it basically looks the same with two doors, one from the outside of the mall and one from the inside of the mall.  I had the Tonkatsu Ramen and I'd say it's pretty good. I don't get all those fat droppings that some so desire (but not me). It had four good slices of char siu and a bit of something shredded. A half egg that was a bit overcooked. And the broth, it had good flavour but not too salty. For $8 it's a steal when comparing against downtown ramen places. For $8 as an instant noodle dish of course it's expensive, but I think it does have a lot more to offer than your instant noodle dish.  The Japanese curry stone rice bowl was piping hot as expected. I'd say it lacks a bit more sauce though.  The tea cups though need to go. They are way too hot to hold and I've heard from people with first hand knowledge there have been accidents with the tea cups being too hot.  I gave it a 3 because the service was decent and food was of good value. I would say it's definitely not as top notch as some of the better ones that I like downtown, but it's better than some others too. What this place has going for it is solid ramen for cheaper prices."}
{"text":"The environment was very clean and the waiter was nice and friendly. He was really quick to sit us down and brought us a salad and genmaicha tea before we even ordered.   We ordered the tonkatsu and miso ramen ($8). Both in which were pretty good considering it was made my Chinese people. The soup was definitely tasty and the pork was actually very tender!   I was surprised because not a lot of people were in there. Food was good. I would recommend to try it."}
{"text":"A friend of ours highly recommended us to try Raku Ramen few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  As always, we did a google and yelp search to find the location.  Surprisingly enough although we been to Kennedy Square a million times, it seems that it's tucked in the far south corner near Power King that we didn't realize it was there.  First thing I notice is for a Chinese run and owned establishment, its very clean!  Next to the Sushi bar there is a private room with a nice white stylish divider. Over head there are some neat hanging bamboo scrolls decorations which I thought was cool.  So once we got seated, the server immediately served us tea and small bowl of salad.  I thought it was nice that we got something to drink and nibble on while we look at the menu.  There were decent selections of Ramen, Sushi and Rolls on the menu but this time my wife ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I ordered the Spicy Ramen.  Unlike the popular Japanese Ramen Franchise (deemed nameless), both soups were flavourful which I believe in the Ramen World is most important.  As my wife described her soup was sweet, light and creamy.  My soup had the right amount of kick in the spice, good aroma and I don't feel there's much MSG otherwise I would get headache.  As for the toppings, the Char Siu was thinly sliced, the noodles was at the right texture and most impressive was the eggs were perfectly cooked (not just hard boiled).  Both of our eggs were soft boiled to the point were the white was set, the yoke was half set half runny.  The only thing I wish was they would add a little more for the toppings (ie:  Have two halves of one egg each bowl instead of just one half.)  Or if they come down the price of extra noodles to $3 instead of $5 I would probably think about paying extra.  Keeping in mind it's already around $9 each bowl.  But I guess in running a business you want to balance price with Quality.  I would definitely swing by again if I have Ramen Cravings.  In terms of service, it was OK as the food came out fast.  But wouldn't mind if they pass by to serve tea.  So for this I would've docked a 1.5 stars to make it 3.5 stars realistically.  But since I can't do half, I'll give them the extra half in hoping they read this post and give the other half of the egg in the next bowl."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly better than I thought. I came here for dinner with four friends out of convenience. I ordered a few things to share,  which came  to a total of $32 for two people. Meals come with complimentary salad.  Yam Fries - thick cut, soft inside, crisp and lightly salted outside. Doesn't come with any dipping sauce so I asked for mayo.   Curry Katsu Udon - surprisingly not bad. The chewiness/slipperiness of udon mixed with curry sauce is pretty good. The pork is juicy inside with a crisp coating.  Tonkotsu Ramen - noodles are hard and eggy tasting, soup is relatively light with salty/creamy taste, comes with corn, egg , wood ear, bamboo shoots. Just had a few bites of this, but for a Chinese place it's not bad.   Spicy Salmon Roll - Not spicy... but good portion of salmon  Tried a bit of takoyaki and it does have bits of squid in it with lots of bonito flakes. The rice comes in stone pot and looks quite large portion size.   Overall, I had low expectations and was hesitant to try this place, but it was decent."}
{"text":"I tried out Raku last weekend.  As the restaurant name indicated that it was an izakaya, I was expecting tapa sized entries.  This was not a correct assumption.  The noodles, rice and make rolls entries were of normal sized.  The grills dishes were big tapa sized - bigger than normal tapas.  Everything tasted fine/okay.  Nothing was distinguish.  The final bill came in at $32.00 plus taxes for 2 people, which was lower than we expected.  I think that this restaurant is not an izakaya, because the atmosphere did not encourage us to order any alcohol.  It can be regard as a competent non-AYCE Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch as we were in the Chinese strip plaza (Wong-Kok) located at Kennedy & Highway 7 in Markham. We picked this place since I was craving for ramen.   We had the Miso Ramen and the Salmon Bento box. The ramen was quite good and the broth was flavourful. It include few pieces of roasted pork, bean sprouts, sliced fish ball, and kernel corn. The corn was a little odd as I would have preferred some green leafy vegetables. The lunch Bento box came with 2 pieces of grilled salmon, 6 pieces of sushi (cucumber & salmon), salad, rice, and miso soup...everything in the box was quite good.  Food wise, it was good throughout but a little pricey for portion size. Service was friendly and attentive. Would I come here again? Yes as the ramen was pretty good but the Bento box is similar to other places."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the past week.    My first visit, I had their skewers, and are always on point, especially their wagyu beef, fatty, tender and very flavourful.  And their takoyaki is crispy on the outside and filled with tender squids.  Their imported Hokkaido uni is just to die for!  Their sashimi are thick cut and always fresh.  Second visit was during lunch, so I decided to try their ramen.  Ordered the regular pork bone broth, was it delicious!  The noodles was perfectly cooked, the broth flavour was so in depth, and I had to order the wagyu beef again as well.  Third visit was with my whole family, we had a big sashimi boat, almost all the skewer menu items, and ramens.  So I don't know what's wrong with people's reviews nowadays, when I go to a highly reviewed yelp restaurant, it's mostly disappointing.  When I go with my instincts and tried out this place, I've not been disappointed at all!  So people, read the reviews but don't get duped.  At least I've learned my lesson.  Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing visit Tenderous rib ramen for $9 - ribs were not tender at all. The noodles were similar if not worse than the stuff you can get from instant noodles. The spiciness level was from 1-5 and 5 being the most spicy. Tried level 2 spiciness and it was indeed very spicy. The Tonkotsu ramen was $8 and it wasn't anymore impressive. It came with thinly sliced pork which tasted bland and flavourless.  The worst part of the meal was the side order of octopus for $6. There were four slices. It was served on top of some noodles and soup. Did not like it at all. It had no real taste and so not worth the $6. It was so bad that I would not eat it even if it was free. Meals came with complementary salad.   At least service was good but thats the only positive comments I can give this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be adequate if you got hungry. Somewhere between my previous visit and the one last night, it lost it's way.  The tonkatsu ramen with a side of pork belly is now $13.50, and i guess has loads of MSG.  The Chirashi.. ugh. for $12.50, it was terrible.  Don't even waste your time: the fish quality is terrible.  As for the service, which used to be ok, for some reason last night, was slow as heck.  The place was not busy - I think there was 3 wait staff for about 9 tables, having to ask a couple of times for tea - really?  And the food service was much slow than usual; the chirashi came out after a few minutes, but the ramen was almost 10 minutes (after we asked them where was our order - I guess it was done and sitting there and no one bothered to bring it out).  I don't know what happened, but I just know I won't be coming back since it went from adequate to completely unacceptable on not just one but multiple fronts: food quality, service and price."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I've seen Raku numerous times in the past as I frequent the plaza this place is in, but never bothered dining here due to the reviews. They do promote their business very well on Facebook though, so I decided to give them a chance.  The entrance is a little weird to Raku. There's a door inside the mall, but that's actually not the entrance. The entrance is actually outside, right beside the main entrance.  It wasn't too busy when I arrived, granted it was around 8:30pm on a Tuesday. The menu has a mix of ramen, izakaya, and sushi options, but I wanted to try the ramen as I didn't feel like having sushi that night.  I ordered the cheese ramen, which was one of their specials not on the menu. Overall, it was okay. For $11 it's a little bit pricier than what I liked, but the fundamentals were there. The broth was quite good, however the cheese was lacking for the most part. The pork belly, unfortunately, was thick and overcooked, so it was quite difficult to chew. Definitely not the best I had.  Service was very good and one of the servers came back to make sure the food was good. I did mention the food was overall acceptable, but raised my concerns regarding the pork belly. They seem to be accepting of criticism, so I'll give them that.  I likely won't return as there are better ramen and izakaya places in Markham, but I wouldn't rule this place off if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Parking is a problem during lunch and dinner time. No MSG added."}
{"text":"The 2 1/2 star this spot got was totally spot on. Food wasn't bad but it was far from the best. The waiter/hostess forgot to give us utensils (chopsticks) and napkins to start. I ordered ramen and it wasn't what I expected..noodles were more like top ramen noodles and the side of pork belly was more like Chinese style pork belly. No pics needed as the ones already posted are accurate."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every visit there.  The cheesey pork noodle soup was great,  pork didn't taste great at all.  Seafood curry rice in stone pot was great, so we're regular ramen codes.  All three in my family enjoyed it and kept going back."}
{"text":"When I heard they are opening a new ramen & izakaya restaurant uptown a few months ago I was excited to try this place out. So I decided to give it a try today and it wasn't what I expected.   The decor is clean and modern, the seats were comfortably divided.   When I saw the menu I was a little confused. First of all, I don't see any alcohol options. Second, there's no Izakaya style food. Third, since the first two weren't offered I was expecting a larger selection of Ramen or emphasis on it. Fourth, there's no lunch special options.   Regardless, my bf ordered the Shio Ramen (pork bone soup base) and I ordered the Miso Ramen. It came with a soup and salad and the miso soup was extremely salty, the salad was standard. I tried my bf's soup and it didn't taste like much, mine didn't fair any better. The serving size is on the small size. The ramen wasn't chewy. The egg was overcooked. The corn, black fungus and bamboo were kept to a minimum. The chasu looked dry and tasted just as dry.   The bill came out to be just a touch over $18 for the two of us.   Before leaving the restaurant I had finished the whole cup of green tea they offered us. As I was walking back into the plaza I can feel my throat tightening up and its a sign for excessive MSG. I had to buy another can of Iced Tea and my throat was still dry.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place for its Ramen."}
{"text":"Raku ramen used to be my go-to ramen place uptown, it is owned by Chinese people, so technically not Japanese ramen (as the only other ramen option uptown was really Ajisen ramen at Warden and Steeles.  The tonkatsu ramen has a delicious broth and comes with 2 slices of pork, corn, a runny egg. The portion is perfect, you can add a side of pork belly, ox tongue for an extra $3-4. I recently noticed a price increase (from $8.50-10 to $10+).. for that price, I rather go to Kinton or one of the ones at Yonge & Finch where they offer fresh authentic japanese ramen.  The service here is always good, and all meals come with a small bowl of salad."}
{"text":"Is great food here. I ordered the Hokkaido milk ramen which is very nice. Love that it is not super salty so you can actually taste the broth. We order the hot stone bowl curry pork chop rice. It's excellent. One of the best in Toronto. The hot stone bowl enhance the flavor and smell of the curry. Get you want to keep eating more and more. We had fish liver as well. Don't expect it would be as flavorful as foie gras, but definitely a lovely little treat for the price."}
{"text":"The pork in the ramen I had had that unpleasant taste that alerts me that the meat is a little old and should not be served.  In Chinese, I hear most people refer to it as having too much \"pork\" taste.  I could be being too severe as this is my first negative review (I usually only review when I am excited about a place)...but it was for a make-up Mother's Day meal that I had brought my Mom here for.  And I get severely annoyed when the pork has this taste to it.  I shudder when recalling it.  The soup definitely was artificial and had MSG (i.e. the tongue got a little numb afterwards), though the contents of the bowl were very neatly prepared and presented in that very nice orderly Japanese way.  There is also a large variety of options to choose from in the menu, but I can't really comment too much as we only ordered the fried salmon belly to eat - which was a better food item to accompany the noodles with...than the yucky pork.  Just because of the pork I am reluctant to return, but if a large group of friends takes me back I will try to find love."}
{"text":"Surprised by the reviews here.  I've been here once only,  for lunch but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I would gladly attend Raku again.  In my party,  we ordered two bowls of the 1) extreme spicy garlic tendorous rib ramen (12$),  2) gyoza (6$) and 3) takoyaki (6$)    1) Favourite of the dishes ordered. If you like \"in your face\" big flavour,  you will love this. Can choose a level of spice ranging from 1 to 5 - 2 is average spice. I typically eat spicier than average and chose a 3 with no regrets. Heavy garlic. Ribs were amazing and everything I would hope for.  Braised to a melt-in-your-mouth texture.  Portion size is also respectable both for meat and noodles provided.  However, given that ramen really runs on the more expensive side of cost for a casual lunch,  it's competition in this price range approaches bento box cost. It was a heavy broth.  No subtlety needed here.    2) This was disappointing.  Some mysterious filling of questionable texture (IE I don't know if it qualifies as meat). Still, an adequate crust  and mouthfeel from the wrap and pan fry.  3) Not a stand-out takoyaki,  but respectable.  Not as springy as some other takoyaki.  Denser also, but good octopus in centre.  Bonito flakes, mayo,  and sauce were good.  The outer crust and texture was nice.     Side note: want to come back for their stone bowl rices.  Can't wait!  Not sure how the sushi/sashimi side of things would hold up to my expectations.  To be honest,  I doubt it will.  Their sushi counter is paltry.  I do want to check out some of their izakaya menu items, but really think customers should look to ramen or rice bowls for their first visit for a sure bet.  I note some of the poor ratings from other reviewers are for service. I also suspect the diverse menu may be hurting their business (too many opportunities to eat something they're not good at!)   TL;DR  Go here.  Expect average service. Order ramen or rice bowls if first-time customer; don't be adventurous. The spicy rib ramen is a standout and packs strong flavors."}
{"text":"Raku Ramen is a little restaurant within New Kennedy Square that offers Japanese food, including sushi and ramen.  At some point, the menu's prices have been tweaked a little.  Ramen used to be $8 for a bowl, but now it's $11.50 with no change aside from adding in bean sprouts.  The ramen itself is decent.  The noodles are reasonably good and I really do like their soup base (I usually get tonkatsu).  It comes with the aforementioned bean sprouts, little pieces of seaweed, mushroom, pork slices, corn, green onion and an egg, none of which are much of anything.  For $8, it was well worth it so I'm a little disappointed about the price change.  There's also ramen with spicey, miso and seafood taste if you so choose.  The appetizers have been changed up a fair bit.  You order them by piece so if you want small quantities of anything, they're worth trying.  The only problem is that if you really like certain ones, the cost can ride up pretty easily.  This does beat how they used to be formatted though so that's a positive.  I can't comment on the sushi because I don't eat it.  The service is generally really good.  The waiters and waitresses that are there are always happy to serve you and your meal is almost always quick to come out.  I've been here upwards of ten times now and I've only had one problem, which was minor.  A few quick notes: They do take the Vicinity Card (1 point per $1 spent, use 200 for $10 off or 500 for $30 off).  If you show them your Platinum Plus Member Card for Toyota (or most other car dealership), you get 10% off if you pay with cash.  I believe you can present both of these but I haven't done so in a while that I don't 100% remember.  In the end, Raku Ramen's food is decent but they have fantastic service.  I could recommend going there for at least a try and if you do like, I can vouch that they are very consistent."}
{"text":"I started looking at these reviews after my wife just said, let's eat here. At first, I was a little concerned, but we're here, so I'm just going with my personal experience here. As soon as we sat down, we were given the menu, tea, and salad. The salad dressing was perfect in its balance, and the vegetable were fresh. We ordered the beef tongue add appetizer. It was very tasty, but just a little too soft. Some may like the texture that way. I don't mind...but my wife prefer it to be a little more textured. My wife ordered the Miso Ramen. It w was very generous in portion, the soup base was good, but the bbq pork was just to fatty. I ordered the Stone Pot Oyaku Don. Though the pot was sizzling hot when it arrive, there was no \"burnt rice\". Disappointing. The fact that it was almost tasteless it's even more disappointing. Portion wise they are very generous, so keep that in mind when ordering. The service was acceptable, nothing bad, but nothing impressive, either. Will we return? VERY likely."}
{"text":"And so, I've came back a second time around with a couple of friends since we were in the area... so why not? :)  Told my friends to stay away from the ramen, which they did lol. I recommended them to try their stone pot rice, and they both loved it very much! Now I can CERTAINLY say that you can't go wrong with stone pot rice dishes :D #sogood #sofilling  As for me, I went out of the norm and ordered Curry Pork Katsu Udon.... eek. The udon was rather tasteless, and you can probably tell it is not authentic Japanese udon (if we're comparing to Zen!) On the other hand, the pork cutlet was pretty tasty... crispy layer and meat was juicy.  **Side note**: One of my friend actually ordered the Curry Pork Katsu Stone Pot Rice and it was SO MUCH BETTER than the udon.  I can't safely say that I would recommend the izakaya portion yet... (the baked oysters we also ordered were not quite up to par!) BUT I'm still a happy returning customer for now :)"}
{"text":"Bad experience compared to other Ramen restaurants. The servers were not clear in terms of what was included. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. They brought it out and I asked if it came with katsu (assuming the name) and they said it will be out separately. So I carried on. Come time for the bill, I was charged extra for the katsu.  Normally, I would not be too fussy about mistakes but they denied it on their part. Not only was the Ramen expensive to begin with for below mediocre quality food, the katsu that came out was one of the smallest portions I have ever come across. For a $15 meal, I expect at least one of either the quality, portion or service to be decent of which none were. I walked out completely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"My decision to return here for the 2nd time was definitely a big mistake.  I ordered katsu udon, slow cooked beef and the eggplant appetizer. The katsu pork was one of the smallest I have ever seen. To make matters worse, it was tasteless. No salt at all.  The eggplant was an even bigger disaster.  It was hard to find the eggplant under all the gooey unknown sauce.  I only ate it for the Benito flakes."}
{"text":"My go to place for ramen. Amazing fast service, the guys there are always welcoming. This place is definitely one of the best ramen joints I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Food: Tonkotsu ramen with tenderous ribs: 2 stars AAA beef, zucchini, Ginkgo, and king oyster mushroom skewer: 1 star each Uni handroll: 4 stars  Firstly, I like how they serve you tea and salad before you order anything. It's a nice touch especially if you arrived hungry.  There's no tonkotsu ramen with tenderous rib on the menu. I actually asked for the extreme spicy garlic tenderous rib ramen without the spice (FYI). In this case, the soup is just standard tonkotsu. Portions were pretty standard compared to other ramen places (small) and I got three small to medium-sized pieces of tenderous ribs. Meh, it was okay overall. Thought it deserved 2 stars since the soup wasn't too salty as are most places.   Most skewers are pretty cheap, but you'll find out why very quickly. AAA beef was meh, slightly chewy, and one piece was just fat. Zucchini skewer....it's zucchini soooo moving on. Ginkgo was...bleh, nothing special. The king oyster mushroom had nothing 'kingly' about it. They were actually really tiny. Not much flavouring on any of the skewers we ordered so I guess that's good since it's healthier???  Uni handroll by far the best part of my meal that night. Surprised that there was actually uni throughout the entire handroll and not just at the top for show. Uni was pretty good, didn't taste funny or anything. I'm a big uni fan so I may be biased lol.   My boyfriend got the regular tonkotsu ramen and he also ordered a side of extra noodles. Compared to most other ramen places, an extra side of noodles usualyl ranges from $1.50 to $3. Here it is $5.50, but you do get another full portion of just noodles and soup.  Ambiance: 3 stars The place isn't very big nor uniquely decorated, but it's a clean and brght dining establishment. Booth seats were comfy and there's a room for larger parties.  Service: 2 stars Service was a little slow even though the izakaya wasn't busy. It took quite a while for us to eve get the menus. Luckily, we didn't have too much issue with ordering and the food took about 15-20 minutes to be served, which was fine. Our waitress was overall pleasant."}
{"text":"I ordered cold ramen with salmon sashimi as the employee recommended. Honestly, this is my first time to have cold noodle in soup. Tasty and good to try it when Summer comes."}
{"text":"Raku is a new Ramen & Izakaya place that opened recently at the location that used to be Wonton Chai Noodle (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/wonton-chai-noodle-markham).  So if you are looking for some wonton noodle fix, you ended up have to settle for ramen....  The set up is really similar as the previous owner with a change of colour theme, fixtures and furniture.  Lunch serves from 11:00 - 5:00 pm daily. I would not call the menu a lunch special menu as the prices are similar to dinner pricing and with just less offerings and no lunch set. Sushi, rolls, sashimi on one page and Ramens, cooked food on the other side.  Tonkotsu Ramen ($8) serves with Miso Soup and Salad  - Small portion, I can eat 2 of those with no problem - The chasu though is nicely done with a great mix of fat and lean ratio and quite tender - The noodle has a good bite - The broth though is a miss as it lacks the savory taste, intense pork flavour and serves not hot enough - Toppings are minimum...   I will be back to try Raku as an Izakaya once they get their liquor licence. Maybe their cooked food and sushi/sashimi might be better.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Their ramen is arguably the best in Markham! Get the original tonkotsu ramen- it's super rich in flavour or if you can handle the spice, try the spicy Garlic one. They let you choose the spiciness 1-5 but beware, it's pretty spicy!"}
{"text":"Had tonkotsu ramen, and shared some sushi rolls with a few friends.  They all liked the sushi, but I found it a bit too ... domestic (put it down to copious use of mayo) The ramen was reasonably decent though. The pork was fine (today, at least!), and the broth was hearty. I would say a bit pricey for the location, but really it's on par for Toronto ramen. (It's the sushi that is too expensive!)"}
{"text":"Tried the wagyu beef skewer. So disappointing. I actually felt I needed to chew and for $6.40 it's way expensive for having a mediocre experience of eating fatty beef.   Then I tried one of my friends katsu Don katsu. The skin is pretty crispy but once I tried to actually taste the meat I thought it was chicken first. Then I remembered it is supposed to be pork. However, it felt like I was eating chicken nuggets.  Then I tied a couple of spoons to taste the stone pot oyako don. It's okay but not for the price.   Finally we had some grilled squid. It didn't taste too fresh."}
