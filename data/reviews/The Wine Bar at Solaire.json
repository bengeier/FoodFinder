{"text":"My husband and I visited the Wine Bar at Solaire and had a great time.  Wonderful place for drinks and the absolutely perfect place for a date night! Cozy, yet upscale atmosphere. The staff and owners are very welcoming and make you feel comfortable. We ordered an appetizer, Browned Queso Blanco, and it was amazing. This would be a perfect spot to rest after a day of shopping in Hudson at First and Main, or a great place to come with the girls. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place to come visit on a Friday night. Very friendly staff, including a very personable owner! My wife and just stopped for drinks, but tried the browned queso blanco appetizer and really enjoyed it! We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for a romantic dinner! The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was quiet and inviting and the owner is incredibly nice! If you want a quiet romantic dinner with great service and a good glass of wine this is your place. One of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of really poor wines. I came here years ago and liked the place a lot. Things have changed.  Sat at the bar. Ordered small plates food since real meals weren't an option. Very bad choices for dinner ( later I went to Luchitas mex rest in Hudson for a real meal)... ordered wine, got a substitution that was awful ( looked it up on the net and it's $6.99/bottle at Costco and very low rated) or $12/glass at Solaire. Tried a different glass. Also awful.  Finally ordered a $85 bottle just to get something drinkable. SO... after 3 \"small bites\" appetizers and numerous attempts at wine I spent way over $150 to have a very low quality meal and wine.  
This place has a huge amount of wine available by the glass... and about 90% of them are very substandard wines that retail for less than $10/bottle. 
I will definitely NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Only came because had restaurant.com gift certificate.  After we ordered all of our food and ate, we were informed that we couldn't use it for the 2 person meal. Apparently there was a disclaimer in 5 point font on the menu that you couldn't even read. The disclaimer was not on the restaurant.com certificate. Wine and food was ok, pretty pricey for what you get. Not happy and will not be back. Server was excellent,  establishment not so much."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for our Anniversary! Loved the muscles and our dinner was spot on. Atmosphere was grand and the service was spectacular!!!  Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here approximately 5 times, each time less impressed than previous visit.  Would have given 5  stars on first visit but. Now they seem to have less specials and less menu items.  On our last visit, they had no beer as beer cooler was broken, and wine seemed to be priced much higher than last time. They wanted $14/glass for a wine that retails for $14/bottle. Spent over $100 including tip for 2 people with a $25 off coupon. Will return but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Solaire is many things...an inn, a wine bar, a restaurant, and a salon/spa.  The only Yelp listing currently is the salon/spa so I'm writing one for the wine bar & restaurant to change that because those reviews are currently ending up under the salon Yelp listing and that's just not right.  My husband and I were out and about on Saturday night looking for somewhere to grab a bottle of wine and a bite to eat. We'd already had dinner so we checked out a few wine bars in the Hudson area.  One looked creepy, another was packed so we headed to Solaire.  

It's tucked away on the second floor above the salon and you enter from the side door. The stairway up to the second floor would scare off some but once you get upstairs, it's gorgeous. It's a cozy atmosphere and not many tables so I'm certain you'd need reservations but we just grabbed two seats at the bar.  Service was slow off and on during the time we were there. We ordered a bottle of wine but we were told it wasn't cold enough so they put it on ice. While I appreciated the effort, it would have been nice if they were prepared. I asked for water while we waited and we also ordered dessert.  My husband got the baklava and I got a chocolate cake with ice cream.  My husband said the baklava was as good as his grandmothers...a huge compliment! Mine cake and ice cream were also quite tasty. We enjoyed our bottle of wine but my husband noticed a bug in his glass.  The server took it away and said she'd remove the cost of half a glass from our bill as that's how much wine was in there at the time. We appreciated that.  One of the owners came up and asked about our dessert so we got to talking about his Greek heritage as my husband is Armenian.  He was great to chat with and it improved our opinion on our experience. We saw two servers there that night.  One was busting her butt while the other was lingering talking to someone I assume is a friend of hers at the bar next to us.

We got our check from the same server who dealt with the bug in the glass but she didn't take off the amount she said she would. I didn't feel like fussing over it as we'd had a nice time there.  It's a pricey place... For one bottle of wine and two desserts it was $60 with tip...and we got a cheap bottle!  I can see us returning for a special dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent boutique and traditional wines. Nice selection of interesting wines by the glass. The lamb chops were excellent. Very friendly service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable and genuinely friendly service in a sophisticated and elegantly designed space. The wine that was recommended exceeded my expectations and was a delight to enjoy while relaxing. Truly enjoyed the atmosphere, wine and appetizers. Felt the heart and passion in the family owned business. Wish I lived closer and hope the community supports this hidden gem so it is there when we come to visit."}
