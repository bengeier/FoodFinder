{"text":"This place was amazing! We'd received menus in our mailbox and decided to try it out and weren't disappointed. I got the chicken and waffles which were AMAZING and well priced. My friends got the fried shrimp basket which was also very yummy. Overall great atmosphere and i recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Rosie's is a charming restaurant with incredibly kind staff/owners. Love coming here. Breakfast is super cheap (under $6 including coffee) though my one qualm is that they don't serve potatoes/home fries. I highly recommend the veggie omelet or the pancakes. They don't get creative with their food but for half the cost of your standard brunch joint it's pretty fantastic! And you can't downplay how welcome the owners make you feel; it's a great experience every time."}
{"text":"We visited this place yesterday and I was hoping the food would be good. Let's just say, I'm glad I did not waste my money on the seafood dish because the jumbo shrimp was way too salty and didn't even taste like shrimp! The fried fish was over fried and very small strips. The wings were about the only thing that was good. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Rosie's is awesome! The foods really inexpensive and it is a family run business, which I love, that has been opened for as long as I can remember, they are absolute sweethearts!"}
{"text":"I've gone there three times now.

There's always a strange, strong smell that puts me off a bit, and can't place it. From the menu I expected typical breakfast food, but they put an Asian spin on it. It was good, but there was no jam, it was difficult to communicate with the server, and the table was cramped. I was asked to leave as soon as my plate was done as they wanted to give the table to a regular.

They won't have to worry about me taking up one of their tables again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Comfortable, unhurried atmosphere, with friendly servers and good breakfasts.  It's been a few weeks, so I don't remember the details, but remember thinking it would be worth a return visit.

edit;  Just went back (a few months later) and remembered a point I wanted to make.  Potatoes don't come with the standard breakfast, but you can add an \"an order of\" hash browns, which is a McDonalds-style pre-formed patty.  Once you've accepted that, it's not bad.  They also charge for coffee refills.  Including the hash browns and two refills, it was still under 8 bucks."}
{"text":"I went out earlier today for a bit of a late breakfast and was taken to Rosie's Kitchen by a friend who'd been there before. Although there's nothing really fancy about the place in terms of decor, it felt so warm, cozy and inviting. It kind of felt like being in a small town breakfast place, where the owners know the customers by name. I also love that they have an open-concept kitchen. 

I ordered the Rosie's Breakfast Special (I think that's what it was called), which came with two eggs, two slices of toast, coffee or tea and ham, bacon or sausages for just $5. I ordered my eggs easy over with sausages and was really happy with what I was given; everything was cooked perfectly, like what I'm used to getting at home. The coffee was nice too. They had a variety of other things on the menu (like bacon sandwiches! yum!!), all priced reasonably well. 

It was a little weird to me that you had to go to the back of the restaurant to get cream/milk for your coffee, instead of the waitress bringing out a small bowl of creamers. I didn't really mind getting up once I figured out where to go. The service was really good and everything came out pretty quickly; I definitely will go back next time I'm in the area. :3 Can't really beat that homey sort of feeling.

And yes, I can confirm that this place is cash only. But there is a bank next door with an ATM, at least."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle was great not burnt just right chicken was not greasy just right. Now I know where to go to get some chicken and waffle."}
{"text":"My first time here was an experience. I had never even heard of this place until listed as one of the featured restaurants for black restaurant week. It was a bit of a trip getting there being that it's deep in huntersville but once there everything was amazing. It is def one of those mom and pops that i loveeee  I order the fish burger with fries which was extremely fresh. My friend had a 2 pc fish plate and another friend had a burger with fries and none of us had any issues with the food. In the midst of us being there a pastor was there who ordered way too much food and offered us an extra dish of crab legs shrimp corn and potatoes and I love a low country boil. It was amazing like the rest of the food. The ambiance here was cozy and welcoming! The staff was very polite and made me feel like I was home"}
{"text":"After recommendation I decided to give this place a try. I ordered Philly cheesesteak to go. The hoagie was soft and warm, overall the sandwich was decent. I was greeted by a young lady by the name of Chelsea I believe. I only knew her name because she said it when the business phone rang. I will def suggest to hire someone more welcoming, the front desk represents and sets the tone for the business and this young lady wasn't very customer- service oriented. I do want to try to give this spot another shot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had a philly, loaded cheese fries and wings.  It was exactly what we were looking for and we will definitely be back for more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The ole bay shrimp and chili cheese fries is so freaking good. Everything I have tried so far is delicious.....Rosie's is Def giving seafood connection a run for there money on the shrimp. This restaurant is a hidden gem in the coulwood area. If you're in the area stop by.....I love it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place to open but 
I was so disappointed we got the fried fish super fishy I actually was scared to eat i, fried shrimp wasn't so bad and the wings weren't so good. I might go back here again but only for the fried shrimp"}
{"text":"In the first place, those of you who know me know I reserve 5-stars for truly exquisite places or events. A 4-star rating from me means I'm a fan, I'll be going back often enough to become a regular and that I'd recommend a place to everyone.

Rosie's was amazing. I got the big bacon burger with fries and it was one of the best burgers I've had. The fries were hot and crispy, and there were a generous portion of them.

My friend got a shrimp hoagie (the biggest hoagie I've ever seen) and shared a few bites with me. I'll be getting one of those next time! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and breaded in a light, crispy breading that didn't swallow the shrimp. If you like your fried shrimp to taste like shrimp and the breading be a style more than the main flavor, you'll love this.

Another person at our table got the fish basket and it was also truly good. HUGE pieces of fish and lots of fresh, hot, crispy fries. I saw one review that said the fish was too fishy. LOL!!! I understand what they mean. I don't like really fishy fish. This is real fish with light breading and truly flavorful. If you like fried fish to taste like fish rather than batter, you'll love this.

The only drawback is that they don't serve fountain drinks. Buy a bottle out of the cooler. No refills. But, if that's what they do to enable them to provide the quality and portions they do, it's a minor thing.

They only have about 4 tables in the whole place,  but chairs lined up along the wall. I get the idea they do more carry-out business than anything else. They deserve it. I'll be back again and again, probably carry-out mostly, but still. I'm really happy I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced casual diner run by a pleasant Korean couple.

Menu includes a variety of basic sandwiches and a $4.99 all day breakfast special.  Chicken schnitzel is quite good (modest in size,) served with a pretty decent side salad for $6.19+tax.

Homey feel with neighbourhood regulars and elderly (like the old school Bay cafeteria.)

The Bagel House nearby sells Montreal style bagels (with a discounted day old section.)

{"text":"My girlfriend and I sometimes come here for breakfast. Maybe once per month. The food is great, the prices are decent, the service is excellent, the place is quiet and relaxing. We could not asking for a better place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this little mom and pop restaurant. I was between appointments and didn't want to spend anywhere near $20 for lunch. 
Rosie's is the perfect antidote to the hoity-toity Restos that line this bit of Mt Pleasant. 
I ordered quiche with a salad and was pleasantly surprised with the large salad and the equally good-sized round of quiche.
The restaurant is frequented by local retirees (at least it was this visit). The cost for a filling, well made meal was $7.69 + bottle of perrier. All in at $11.00. Loved it. Maybe I'm getting old myself."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant even though this specific location has seen quite a few restaurants that have come and gone over the years however with the rave reviews I saw on their Facebook page I had to give them a try. I visited this restaurant on a Friday night and it was fairly busy given that it was a Friday (no one cooks on Friday right?). The place itself is small, there are about 4 tables if you want to sit down to eat so I really think this is more of a pick up your order and go spot. All the tables were full and a huge party actually came in which what looked like the intentions to sit down and eat however when they noticed that all the tables were taken they left. Now let's talk about the experience....I was able to order fairly quickly. I ordered the I Love Seafood (crag legs, shrimp, corn, potato, beef smoked sausage) and Chili Dog basket (2 hot dogs and fries). We sat down to wait because they were fairly busy (looked like only 2 cooks were in the back and then the cashier taking orders) and I knew this was not a fast food location. We waited for 30 minutes before our order was ready. To me 30 minutes is a long time (not to mention it was TGIF) so I was ready to go home. With that said I think they need to improve their wait time or next time I will just call my order in ahead of time. Now let's get to the food. I couldn't wait to get home to try a fry (like who does?) so I tried one in the car and it was hot fresh out the grease. So my mouth is watering all the way home....could we finally have a winner in this location I said to my boyfriend. I got home and first tried the hot dogs and they were very good. I'm funny about my chili but I thought it tasted homemade and fresh. My boyfriend had the Seafood platter but of course I tried everything and it was delicious. I haven't tried Seafood Connection yet but based on what I have seen from that restaurant Rosie's seafood platter is similar to what they have yet cheaper. Final outcome, I will definitely be back. They have some pretty good specials during the week too if you really don't want to cook but don't want to spend a lot of money. More restaurants such as this is needed in this area however they just need to work on getting food out faster and perhaps consider expanding their sit down area."}

I stumbled across Rosie early Valentine's day, looking to catch up with an old friend! As we walked in to this hole in the wall, we realized immediately it was a neighborhood place different from the surrounding fancy and expensive shops. 
What I like about Rosie's is that it has an open kitchen concept; you can literally see all of the ingredients and the food that is being cooked. On top of this, the portion and price make for a very good overall value. Finally, Rosie`s has a comfy neighborhood feel, and we witnessed a particularly nice scene when a customer presented the owner with a bunch of flowers! You definitely don`t see that everyday.

This being said, I can say I`ve consumed somewhat better and more creative brunches elsewhere. But if I`m ever wandering at Bayview and Eg(g!) early Sunday morning, I would definitely consider Rosie`s Kitchen.

Last note: CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at the number of 5-star reviews that Rosie's has received for breakfast. They cook their eggs in the microwave, and their bacon is quite often on the tough side. 

On the other hand, they have a cute little back patio that's secluded and quiet that would definitely warrant a visit, provided that you're not going for breakfast. 

I haven't visited for lunch, but we stopped going there because we found that breakfasts elsewhere were better."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place faithfully since they've arrived and it just doesn't deliver. Food is either as bland as fat free mayo or overloaded with salt. The location rotates business in and out like a revolving door and unfortunately I don't think this business will be an exception. I really want to support this place, like genuinely want to support them but I can't eat what they serve."}
{"text":"This place is fire.  The food is lit!!!! Get it? Lit...fire...anyway this place has the best quality food.  I l love the wings and especially the people."}
