{"text":"Great filling salads!
The atmosphere on the inside is very charming with casual mismatched furniture and the prevalence of unfinished wood.  The outdoor patio is a little biermrkt but they do serve beer, so.

I got the arugula & beet with added tempeh and found the salad a bit too salty.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, and I guess I can't complain about stinginess with the dressing... but maybe ask for it on the side.  

Also got the farmers market to go and it was great.  Cilantro dressing highly recommended.

Coffee was also surprisingly tasty.  Or maybe I just really needed it .."}
{"text":"Total waste of money and ripped off! I went there yesterday and ordered the chicken wrap for take out. I just took it out this afternoon and realized they charged me $4 for chicken and they did not add any chicken to the wrap wtf?!?!? Unbelievable. The portion sizes are extremely small for what you get too. I will not be going back. The food was meh! Will not be back. It came with potatoes and they were SO dry and tasteless. It seemed like they were old potatoes sitting out for hours. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Bad service, long wait for a table, huevos rancheros were dry and bland. Muy disappointing. Had to wait until my breakfast came to be given coffee and no refills. Bad breakfast, second time. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Plain, simple and good food. Every small eatery should be like this place. Everything we ordered had the taste that was worth the price and the freshness that warrants a repeat visit. The service was friendly and pleasant. The decor quirky and inviting. First tip, try the specials as they change regularly. Second tip, go!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to hit up the Junction on Sunday for lunch and I suggested we eat at The Beet. I'd been here a couple of times before and really enjoyed the food. The Beet offers a wide selection of salads, burgers, sandwiches, and wraps, almost all of which are made entirely from local and organic ingredients. For those of you who have restrictive diets, The Beet offers a number of vegan and vegetarian options, and all of their sandwiches and wraps can be made with gluten-free or multi-grain bread. 

Food - I ordered the Avocado and Tofu sandwich ($13) on gluten-free bread, which was served with a side salad. The sandwich was loaded with thick, creamy pieces of avocado, huge chunks of tamari ginger tofu, tomato, lettuce and vegan mayo. The tofu was expertly seasoned and incredibly flavourful. Overall, the sandwich was so delicious that I wolfed it down in just a few bites. However, when combined with the 16 oz. Beta Booster freshly squeezed orange and carrot juice ($8), I was well satisfied.

My girlfriend ordered the daily special, which was a breakfast sandwich filled with egg, bacon, roasted chicken, pesto, cilantro, and vegan mayo on gluten-free bread. It was just as delicious as my sandwich. She also ordered a juice - the 16 oz. Becca's Blend juice ($8), consisting of grapefruit, pear, and lime, which was very refreshing.

Service - We were promptly seated on the patio by our server after a table was cleared for us. We were handed menus when we sat down, and served fresh water flavoured with an orange slice while we browsed the menu. After ordering, our food took no more than 10 minutes to arrive at our table. However, we did notice that other tables appeared to be waiting a bit longer for their food to arrive. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about some of the menu options.

Price - The price is certainly on the high side, but well worth it for the freshness and quality of ingredients. Expect to spend around $50 for two people if you order juices or smoothies in addition to your main course. If you stick to water, you'll be closer to $30 for two people.

Overall, this is an amazing restaurant. We are already planning another visit back to The Beet soon!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice. Both times the service was terrible and they seems to constantly be out of things. This is not a huge menu so it's shocking how many things they run out of. The first time I was here there were no more breakfast sausages at 11am, they also were out of a number of menu choices. I had the granola. Good, but the portion was a joke for how much I paid for it. about a 1/4 cup of granola and a cup of yogurt and a couple berries. Their fresh pressed juice is warm and they don't even add ice to it. Unless you have to go here due to diet restrictions, I would pass."}
{"text":"I appreciate that there are lots of vegan options, but two out of the three times I've eaten here, I've been quite disappointed. 

On my first visit, I had an underwhelming and overpriced wrap (on a gluten free tortilla) that I wouldn't recommend, and on my second visit, a soup that was pretty good (the pieces of seasoned bread that come with it are AMAZING but can't be purchased on their own). 

What made me feel like I won't be going back was the purchase of a severely overpriced and very bland Mac 'n Cheese (it came to around $18 for a to-go container of it!). 

The staff have never been particularly warm.  Maybe I just haven't been ordering the right items, but if I'm going to eat lunch in the Junction I'll be going to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"It is a prefect place for people with food allergies.   Their foods  are very healthy and low sugar.  I highly recommend the blackbean burrito and the quinoa chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Sorry Beet, you've lost your way. 

Over the past year or more I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of food and service at the Beet. Yesterday it reached a whole new low, so I won't be returning. Here are some points that might help you get back on track:

1. Hire servers that care to be there, not servers that appear inconvenienced when you point out they forgot a portion of the order. \"I apologize, I forgot x from your order, let me take care of y from your bill\" is better than the \"oh, your mac and cheese didn't make it on to the chit\" we got yesterday. It didn't make it because you forgot, so apologize and try to smoke a little less pot on a workday.
2. Stop shrinking the salad portions! Salad is your bread and butter, stop ef'ing it up!
3. Wash your lettuce, for the love of everything holy wash all of your produce organic or not! Unwashed lettuce left me chewing on grits of sand. 
4. I understand that organics carries a price premium, however charging $11 for a glass of smoothie is offensive... two pints of beer offensive."}
{"text":"It's not cheap but it is totally worth it.  Yummy organic food. Lots of things for the omnivores or vegetarian  in your group .  My dad had the chicken.  It was very good and also organic and free range."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in servers/host- can't really tell who's doing what in this place- were unwelcoming and inattentive. 
The menu and food looked really promising. Unfortunately, after 10-15 minutes of not even being approached, we decided to leave. 
Recommendation: take-out only."}
{"text":"Meal was okay, but not what I ordered. They ran out of several menu items and offered nothing to compensate for giving me the wrong drink and meal"}
{"text":"A newish addition to the burgeoning Junction strip, The Beet offers a selection of simple and nutritious mostly local, organic menu items, created by pooling the culinary creativity of a naturopath and a nutritionist. 

Where things can't be sourced locally, they choose fair trade items. And the sustainable focus is apparent not only in the menu, but in the decor - tabletops are made from bamboo or pressed sunflower seed husk, and reclaimed furniture and decor can be found throughout. Lighting is mostly natural, and toilets have 2  low- and high-water flush options, depending on, well... you know.

Brunch is kinda nice - egg dishes, seed pate and veggie sandwiches, some organic meat sides, a few south american and asian twists. All baked goods are gluten free and vegan, but much much better than the usual paperweights that result from those kind of experiments in muffin making. And the coffee and smoothies are great.

The atmosphere is cheery and the staff friendly. All 'round it's a good neighbourhood joint, where you can hang for a while, either in the sunny main area, or on the lovely little side patio."}
{"text":"I have tried both the lentil burger and the Thai rice bowl, both were really good. My dine-in experience was decent. Service was slow but our waitress was friendly. I found the portions to be pretty small for the price and when we tried to order, a few items were already sold out off the menu at 2pm!

Despite these shortcomings, the lentil burger was one of the best veggie burgers I've had in a long time. I will go back for that alone! They also have a nice patio I'd love to try. I just wish they had bigger portions."}
{"text":"Low marks for the staff. Pretentious, over-priced and slow. Hearing the server say \"oh, I forgot about you\" when it isn't busy sums up several experiences I've had there. There's several much better places in the neighbourhood (Cool Hand of a Girl!)."}
{"text":"Such an unique place that serves food that is not just good for you but gosh darn delicious. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is a great go to spot for a clean, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Ok it's organic. But also an overpriced, stifling (no AC) and badly decorated place with mediocre food, small-ish portions and nice but unskilled service. But wait, it's so hip!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great ingredients and very kid friendly. Would give a five star but it is a bit pricey (although you do get what you pay for!)."}
{"text":"Love this place! great food, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"the food is five stars, no question. I love their menu and am willing to pay a touch extra knowing that their ingredients are responsibly sourced, fresh, and of the highest quality. never had a bad meal, nor have any of my dining compatriots. I also dig the atmosphere, and their patio is a really nice place to spend a sunny morning.

but I've never had a server actually roll her eyes at me before. and then go and do it at another table too. since the spring the service has been going way downhill which is too bad. I used to be a regular and would like to be again."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast wrap (a special) and my girl had the bananarama. Awesome food and cool atmosphere. Place is smaller so we had to wait a bit for a table. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has great food, but quite expensive for what you get and the service is remarkably terrible!
We went and the place was full (not packed but most of the tables were full).  We sat for an hour and ten minutes with increasingly restless children before food finally arrived (after we asked several times).   Each time we complained we were met with unapologetic apathy from the staff. 
Aside from that, beware the prices!  A $4 side of fruit consisted of four tiny orange slices, four tiny grapefruit slices and 4 tiny apple slices - in all probably 2/3 of one piece of fruit. My $4.50 coffee was mediocre.  Aside from that, the high priced entrees were worth 2/3 of what they charged (and would have been priced that way at any other restaurant).
This same restaurant with 20% lower prices and competent staff would have gotten a 5 star review but as it actually exists I'd recommend staying away!"}
{"text":"The Beet is my favorite casual/organic resto in Toronto.  Why?

It's well priced considering everything is fresh, local and organic.  

They cater to vegans, vegetarians, omnivores and gluten free 

Their daily specials are always out of this world delicious

Their coffees and drinks are scrumptious

They serve super yummy sangria.  And I've been around ;)

Their desserts are healthy, but yummeriffic 

Overall, I've been obsessed with this place since I discovered it about 2 years ago, when I was lost wondering the Junction area."}
{"text":"Wow! So many items and most of them gluten-free.  This is a great place to visit - especially when one person in the group is following a paleo lifestyle.    My new fav - the quinoa and mushroom burger.  It was delicious and very filling.  Also tried the sunrise citrus juice - refreshing!  I plan to go back."}
{"text":"This place could be great, the food itself certainly is. Unfortunately the owner is a terrible business manager and has no idea how to run a cafe effectively. The operations are so poorly organized it's impossible for the serving staff to manage the space, hence the many complaints about slow service. They try, it's not their fault. 

Perhaps most surprising from a place that has built its reputation around serving ethical food, the owner is also quite happy to break labour laws, hiring multiple servers for unpaid, full day \"trial shifts\" and never bothering to so much as call them back to let them know they don't have a job. This has become common practice in the food industry in Toronto, but it is definitely, completely illegal and one would expect a higher standard from a business that makes money convincing the public that they are committed to the social and ecological values surrounding organic and fair trade."}
{"text":"Awesome organic, healthy food. The steak skirt sandwich is pretty awesome.  This place is awesome for people who are gluten free, I love their gluten free baked goods"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for quite some time as I love their use of organic/local food. I have always found the food to be reasonably priced, very tasty and the atmosphere laid back and enjoyable!
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was their lack of changing up the menu/adding new items. The special at night is enjoyable, but I wish they created more new options for the day!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Beet for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has never failed to impress and satisfy me. On a cozy corner of Dundas Street West, this bohemian eatery dons art on the walls from local artists and a giant chalkboard where you can find their daily specials, desserts and a vast list of teas, smoothies, wines and beer. The service is pleasant and prompt and they bring you a bottle of water with fresh lemon as soon as you sit down.

The huevos rancheros is the best I've ever had. Their pico de gallo is to die for and the use of plain avocados instead of guacamole makes the whole dish fresh and simple. I find other places tend to weigh this dish down with too many added spices and salt.

The tofu and avocado sandwich is my go-to for lunch. Get the salad with it. It's full of greens, beets, nuts and seeds with a brilliant green coriander dressing. The burgers are great too, there really isn't a disappointing item on the menu. Each dish is crafted thoughtfully and considerately. 

I always feel energized after eating at the Beet, which is probably due to the food being local and organic whenever possible. Their organic coffee is spectacular and it's nice to take it out onto their patio when the weather's nice."}
{"text":"The food at The Beet is fantastic, with many options for meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans. It's not cheap, but given the quality of ingredients most items seem appropriately priced. Service can be slow (especially out on the patio), and the owner has been rude to me on multiple occasions when she's been serving food (ranging from correcting my pronunciation to very brusque service). Still, four stars for how tasty the food is."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very healthy.  Their soups are a special treat.   I always feel great after eating here.  As a bonus, in the summer they have the best patio in the Junction.  The restaurant has a charming eclectic quality and is family friendly - sometimes too friendly.

Star lost for noise level (high ceilings - small place - it echoes) - more accurately half a star lost"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing. Had everything to be a great place if it wasn't for the fact that getting a simple juice takes 35 minutes! And they will give you attitude if you try to hint to the fact that they forgot about your order. Waste of time. Lost my trip since I was gonna check some stores and by the time I got out of this place everything had closed. Boooooo to the beet."}
{"text":"Although my first instinct was to be turned off by how *healthy* everything was, the brunch was delicious!  I had the Huevos Rancheros and hubby had the brunch bowl (it was a special).  Portion sizes were definitely small, especially given the price.  Service was slow-ish, but relaxed... and so were we, so we didn't mind.  We bought the world's-smallest $2 cookie to take with us.  More like a peanut butter ball...

Overall consensus was that we enjoyed it, but wouldn't rush back.  It was a nice meal, but not anything we'd crave.  However, next time I'm having brunch with one of my vegetarian/celiac/vegan friends, I know where we'll go!

Bonus - they have a proper change table in the washroom (not just one of those fold-down plastic jobs... like an actual change table).  They also have a kids' menu that even has baby food on it.  Babies welcome!"}
{"text":"Sometimes this place is okay, but service is always super slow and the quality of food is uneven. Tonight was the absolute worst when I ordered a take out burger with cheddar cheese and avocado. When we got home I realized there was no avocado, the cheese was a weird lump of cold aged soft cheese rather than melted cheddar and it was served on a cheap looking whole wheat bun instead of the kamut bun advertised on the menu, which we've always had in the past. We called up to ask what happened, expecting them to just offer to remake the burger like most restaurants would. Instead they told us they would give us a credit for our next meal. Didn't even offer to make us a new one tonight or apologize. After several minutes of complaining it finally came out that they were just trying to use up these substituted ingredients. The final straw was that they offered to give us a kamut bun if we drove back rather than just remake the burger. Won't be coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"I love The Beet! Having a moderate sensitivity to gluten, this place offers me plenty of tummy-friendly options that don't taste like a sad piece of cardboard. My usual go-to is the Huevos Rancheros, but I've dabbled into a few other dishes and I've yet to be unsatisfied. The patio makes for a great brunch spot in the summertime, but like most restaurants with outdoor space, you may want to go a bit earlier when it's warm out to beat the Sunday brunch crowd."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but the food is excellent. Creative dishes using healthy ingredients, plenty of items there to please the entire family. Staff are great. Gets a tad hot inside in summertime; wear shorts/skirts. Breakfast is a standout."}
{"text":"Let me make this simple.  The best thing about the place is the coffee.  Second are the servers... all very nice people (a bit slow but might not be their fault... but well mannered and that means a lot to me).

The food is... ermm well I guess its ok - some things are a bit too pricey but the menu is well thought out with good options.  If you can afford to eat here and spend $25  on a wrap and a protein shake (tax and tip included)... well maybe you should give me a call!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere but painfully slow service. Luckily the food was so good it made up for the service aspect. The tempeh tacos, verde sandwich and buenos Dias wrap all made us want to return for seconds. Highly recommended if you're looking for healthy options"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always feel so good after leaving. Food is clean, local and healthy! The also have Great treats if you are craving something sweet without all the guilt. I always get the farmers market salad and my hubby is crazy for the lamb burger. Beautiful patio in the summer and kid friendly. I would eat here every day if I could:) oh and lots of gluten free options!!!"}
{"text":"I've had a great selection of meals here. My favorite menu item is the Steak Salad. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

The Beet is on the pricier side for the neighborhood and generally has small portions although they have very nice, fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is ok but but overpriced. The server was a bit snarky.  Had a burger, sweet potato fries, and a beer for $20."}
{"text":"is this the beet or is it the passenger .. whatever the case may be: an anemic burger with some limp greens and substandard bun for $18 .. a half pint of beau's for $7 .. come on!"}
{"text":"The vegan bbq wrap and tomato soup were excellent together. I would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago and had a pleasant experience. I came today with a group of coworkers and we were all incredibly disappointed.
We are a group of 6 and only one person (farmers harvest salad and a side of wedges) enjoyed her meal. The rest of us had a hard time finishing what we ordered(which is a crazy thought considering how tiny the portions are) 
The food is written up on the menu to sound delicious and innovative- however the end result seemed like very low grade fast food.  Over priced, nothing very delicious - very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here many times - and originally I liked it very much.  It was my go to spot and I would often take friends / family here.  It can be expensive (eg freshly squeezed oj) but accommodating for someone who has food sensitivities.  

That being said, I have been consistently disappointed over the past few months.  I've ordered takeout three times recently (two times too many) and the food is not worth the price.  They are becoming sloppy and the portions are inconsistent with what I would get if I sat in.  I have contacted them with my complaints before writing this review.   I guess business is good.  So,  I could do a much better job at home I realize.  Maybe something changed with the management...there is a disgruntled vibe..."}
{"text":"Do not go into this restaurant. Don't do it! Think about your mental health.  The service is awful. I waited 30 minutes for food. They offered it to me free of charge but still kept me waiting. I left without it. The people sitting next to me said that the food was not worth the wait. I told them that I would add their comment to my review."}
{"text":"A once avid supporter of The Beet, I have since decided not to spend my money there anymore.  Even when I was a regular customer, the service was slow, and the customer service was poor (I once got my eggs with a long hair in it - mine is short - and ended up waiting a very long time for a replacement meal that was not discounted), but I continued to go because the food was tasty and I felt it was important to support a local business.  The straw that broke the camel's back happened after I called in a take out order.  I went to pick it up, paid for it, came home, had my meal and went downtown.  I received a call from the restaurant hours later, informing me I would need to come back to the restaurant to pay for my lunch.  I was confused, as I was sure I had paid, and checked my wallet.  The cash I had used was definitely gone, so I insisted they were mistaken.  Only then did she back down and told me they only knew it was me or someone else, so it must have been the other person.  Instead of explaining this to me to start with, I felt accused of something I didn't do.  I never received an apology, and  I was irritated at the way it had been handled.  I wrote two letters of complaint; one to the restaurant's email address, and a week or two later to the owner directly.  Both letters went unanswered, so I've determined my money isn't important to them anymore.  I haven't been back since.

What a shame.  I hope at some point this restaurant is bought by someone who appreciates customers."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a small group of friends for brunch.

As mentioned before, it's a bit tucked away from the street, through a shared entrance with a TD Bank machine.

The food here is great! Several of my friends ordered the huevos rancheros and loved it. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with golden and sweet potato wedges. And as a lover of ketchup, can I just say how much I LOVE their freshly-made ketchup? I'm not sure what the flavouring/spice they use, but I love it.

There were also a couple orders of (*I* think) the chocolate quinoa cake. It was REALLY good. 

Decor is simple, and the waitress who served us was great. 

There's only one restroom (it's a small place, so completely understandable), but it's nice and large and clean!

I'd definitely return here."}
{"text":"Why have I never Yelped this place?  I've been a couple dozen times over a 3 year span. Perfect meal, perfect service every time.  I have food allergies (real allergies and anaphylaxis), they are so thorough. 
I love bringing people here, it's a crowd pleaser with good prices for the quality. Try anything, it's all good. It's hard to have a favourite when the specials are always great too.

Tip-use the bathroom, it's bright and homey."}
{"text":"Every time I go to a place in the Junction, I sing that song in my head that goes like this, \"Conjunction Junction, what's your function? Hooking up words and phrases and clauses.\" Why? I wish I could tell you. But, one thing I can tell you about is a lil place in this neighbourhood called The Beet, which is an organic cafe that serves up some proper healthy meals, juices and smoothies. All of their ingredients are certified organic and local. This spells out one thing in my mind: fresh. 

I've been here a few times before for brekkie and it never fails to jump start my day. The Buenos Dias wrap and Huevos Rancheros are muy muy delicioso (Welcome to Spanish class!). I also love how small and cosy it is, and the natural light makes it feel bright and inviting. As an added bonus, there's a patio. Since \"patio\" is my middle name, I tend to gravitate toward great little places that have them.

Next time I'm heading to the Junction and inevitably singing that little ditty in my head, I may just pop into The Beet and get everyone to sing along with me!"}
{"text":"Had the Roast Chicken Sandwich and a ginger carrot soup. Absolutely fantastic . Great quality ingredients, very pure chicken (I.e. Not that fake plastic chicken you get places), perfect portion sandwich (not small not huge). They also provide you with a good amount of chicken on the sandwich I.e. Not the thin single slice or two you'd get at other sandwich places. Not overbearing in salt, tasty not bland. Soup was equally very tasty. Will definitely go back. Would be awesome if this place was on a food delivery app."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The staff is friendly and the patio is nice in the summer. They accommodate dietary restrictions which is great. My favorite items on the menu are the avocado tofu wrap and the buenos dias wrap. They are so yummy, I cannot believe it. Very healthy too. They had a Morrocan stew as a special of the day. I just had to have it and I was glad I did. It was so tasty. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you want something healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the vegetarian/vegan equivalent of a speakeasy, except everything sold here is totally legal and it's not super hard to find - it's just neatly hidden into the back of what used to be a TD Bank.

The design is minimalist at best, but not in a negative way. Simple can, and in this case IS, better with a focus put more into a healthy menu and maximizing the smaller space. My one complaint about the size of the space is that the kitchen is located in the restaurant itself and with the ovens/stoves cranking food out it got super hot in there.

I was only there for a drink and I after reviewing the menu, I had to have one of their amazing sounding smoothies. After hearing the servers recommendations I decided on the 12oz Tropicana ($7). Made with fresh Mango, banana, coconut milk, and Agave nectar it was incredibly thick and delicious and the fact that it was topped with some cinnamon really tied it all together beautifully!

I can say with certainty that if I was a junction resident this would be a regular spot for me to get my healthy eat/drink on! Looking forward to returning!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely brutal.  You should get menus right when you sit down.  If you dont get them, it shouldn't take ten minutes.  You certainly shouldn't have to get up and go look for them yourself after ten minutes of wondering why someone who got sat after you already has menus and drinks.  When you do go ask for them, the resoponse from the surly waitress should absolutely not be to roll her eyes, say \"yea i'm looking for them too\" and then walk away with no other words.  A simple, \"hey guys we are running low on menus, give me a second to find one\" would have totally and completely fixed that situation.  the table of five sitting next to you, who ordered after you, should not get their food before you.  But I guess thats what happens when one of your three bored, empty, miserable watiresses forgets to actually punch your order in.  There is a difference between poor service because its busy and poor service because they just don't care, and the ladies at the Beet do NOT care. 

Having said that, the food is great.  The apple with cheddar and ementhal grilled cheese sandwich is awesome! Even the side salad was amazing, and I'm not usually impressed by garden salads.  The atmosphere is cute, the music is good, the menu is delicous.  I don't even really thinks its all that overpriced, but I was surprised to learn that our pitcher of sangria was $35.00.  In any case, its really too bad that the service is so awful, because I will definitely think twice about ever going there again.  Service is kinda pretty important when it comes to enjoying a meal out."}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time, but finally stopped in last weekend. Nice relaxed atmosphere.

We both had the Huevos Rancheros, which were fantastic. I was a bit skeptical about the serving size when our server put them down on the table, but it was perfectly filling without being heavy. 

The place has a ton of gluten-free options and I'm really excited to bring my celiac friends back to check it out."}
{"text":"This place is damned tasty and worth a trek out of the my neighbourhood, worth the trek north of Bloor, worth a short bus ride from the subway station. If I had a car or lived nearby, I would likely go here on a weekly basis for brunch. As it stands, I find myself out this way at least once a month.

The vegetarian options are so tasty and the meaty options seem to impress my friends. I don't find it significantly more expensive than your typical Toronto brunch (definitely more than a diner, but most places are) and that said, I am willing to pay for good food that is organic and healthy AND delicious. 

It can get pretty crowded so go early or be prepared to wait as I don't have any favourites within walking distance I can refer you to and it seems some people like to linger. Given the trouble I once had in getting FOUR people seated together, I would also not recommend going here with a group.

The service could stand to be a bit more attentive and friendly on some days, but other days, I find the service fantastic. Definitely worth checking out some time! 

Oh, and the coffee is also quite tasty."}
{"text":"I came to the Beet with some friends and had a really good time. The cafe is really small but the menu makes up for that.

The Beet is a really healthy vegan friendly restaurant. This is perfect for anyone who is either/both lactose and gluten intolerant. When I heard about this cute cafe, I had to try it.

The Beet has tons of organic juices and green smoothies. They also have a great menu. They have main entrées, breakfast choices, desserts and sides that can be made gluten and lactose free.

I was so impressed when I saw lactose free cheeses on the menu. This is the first time I have seen lactose free cheese on a menu anywhere in the city. Can you imagine how excited I was?

I ordered the Buenos Dias Wrap and it was phenomenal. I arrived at the restaurant not too hungry but I ate the entire thing because it was so delicious!  Substituting the cheese for the vegan cheese was the icing on the cake. It gave my wrap such an amazing flavour lactose free clientele can't experience at too many places in the city. 

Our waiter was really friendly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered the vegan Mac and cheese, the green lentil vegan burger and a grilled cheese sandwich I believe. All over, we all enjoyed our dishes. However, my friends daughter didn't really like the Mac and cheese. It might be because it was vegan and she wasn't used to that. 

We then tried the desserts and were really impressed. I tried the peanut butter cookie and it was delicious. I was so full at this point that I couldn't try the cake. One of my other friends tried the sipping chocolate and she really liked it.

The one flaw was this restaurant is so popular that they had run out of a few things by the time we got there. They no longer had potato wedges, garden tacos and one of the soups. The good news is this means everything is super fresh and made daily like you would expect at any good quality restaurant."}
{"text":"Relocating down the street to partner up with Passenger seems to have been a great idea for this organic cafe -- this new corner space is lovely and light-filled, with a large patio. The table sign here says that The Beet menu was \"designed by a certified holistic nutritionist for maximum benefit and flavour.\" Overall it does taste healthy. Since Veggielicious is on right now we tried the tempeh tacos (good) with a side of wedges (great), which came with a Tonica kombucha (we got mango, which isn't as good as peach) and a lemon tart. We also tried two sides: the Loaded Avocado (tastes healthy) and the gluten-free mac and cheese (only ok. Glad we did t order the bowl version!) Great music in here too!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 avocado with coconut rice for an app and the huervos rancheros for lunch! Great food and atmosphere. Highly recommend to anyone particular about fresh local, organic ingredients."}
{"text":"Once I got past the long hair in my breakfast bowl it was actually pretty tasty . I did like this place but some things did seem a little dirty eg. Coffee cups / the cup the cream was in . I will probaly go back again though to give it another try"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.  I just enjoyed their organic egg nogg latte.  Holy freaking delicious.  WAY better than any \"chain\" store holiday lattes, thats for sure!
My friend also enjoyed a tasty Americano, only 2.50!
The food looked great as well, but for now I'll just stick to my caffeine!"}
{"text":"Our little family of 3 decided to eat here after the Ex.  We wanted something light and healthy and this was a great spot!  The service was great!  The food was delicious and fresh and what I loved was their baby friendly menu.  They have a kids menu which caters infants to older children.  They also make good lattes which they source their beans from Merchant of the Greens.  We would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The menu is quite big. Had the beet juice with pear instead of apple (they had run out) and it was great. The huevos rancheros were sort of bland (had to add hot sauce). The vegan chocolate cheesecake was pretty good. 

Service was meh. When I asked for hot sauce the waitress forgot and I had to get it myself. When I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake it took the waiter ten minutes to let me know they were out. (At this point our waitress had forgotten about us entirely, I think).

Would probably go back to try the smoothies."}
{"text":"I loooove this cafe!

the ambiance is so relaxing - the music that was playing on the background throughout our visit was very nice and easy but at the same time somehow cheerful and happy.

tons of vegan options and everything is organic,

koodos to their smoothies! I had Omega energy or smth of that kind: banana + orange juice + flex seeds + chia seeds... I think that was the mix. it was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! and then veg sandwich with tofu and avocado and it tasted amazing and I ended up being sooooo full! 
I wanted to try their vegan cheesecake and some cookies and other desserts but there was just no space in my body to fit a tiny more food from this or any other place.

very cozy cafe + very amazing food!

p.s. side of reg and sweet potatos was amazing - their home fried sweet potatos are to die for!
p.p.s. I need to come back on a monday night to use their $12 offer = burger+beer!"}
{"text":"Delightful brunch place with a well appointed patio.  We had the Huevos rancheros with a side of kimchi sausages.  T was yummy as the eggs were cooker perfectly and the sausages were spicy and addictive.  I really liked the flavour combination and left feeling not super heavy with what I just ate.  Will definitely come back here again and try the other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Beet is one of those places I accidentally stumbled upon one afternoon while I was looking for food in \"the Junction.\"  I Went in and out of many okay looking spots before walking through the door of the Beet.  Well, actually you walk through the door to a TD ABM, the restaurant's just past it. Totally odd, but makes sense once you've seen it.

I've been there twice and loved my food both times.  Both times I was in a rush, and expected to do takeout, and both times I decided that I would stay after all, sit down, and enjoy the atmosphere.  

HUEVOS RANCHEROS were hot and gooey, thanks to a blessing of Quebec White Cheddar.  The avocado is super fresh, and the eggs taste market purchased.  

I also had the EGG SANDWICH which is served with some salad and fruit.  It's a gourmet sandwich that definitely delights.

The show stoppers at Beet are their SMOOTHIES.  I love myself some thick berry goodness. 

The prices are reasonable, the food is organic, and the taste...magnifique!  Please go and support local!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  We walked to the Junction from the Annex and were famished by the time we got there.  The food was delicious - we split the poutine and the quinoa special.  It came very quick, considering a saturday night and most tables were full.  They have wine and beer which is also a great plus.  All around great atmosphere, great service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I like the food a lot here. The breakfast being my favourite. 
But I'm not really a fan of the atmosphere. Sitting out in the patio during the summer was really nice, but inside, it's cramped and stuffy. I don't usually eat in here during the winter. 

Ive also tried the raved about mac and cheese. If you like and have experienced real cheese, it's not the same. I actually kind of like Bunner's version down the street. 

Its one of my go to places for brunch in the summer, until it's sister restaurant The Passenger opened up across the street."}
{"text":"Can't rate our lunch because we never got it. We went here for a late lunch on a not very busy day. Waited 20 minutes to place our order and after 40 minutes of waiting were told that their machine malfunctioned and we had to leave. We waited over an hour from sitting down to giving up. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Yeah this place is a keeper.  I went there for dinner last night with my BFF.  She has eaten there before and has loved everything so suggested we go for our catch up dinner. 

I was not at all disappointed.  I ordered the vegetarian curry roti and it was great. I wish there wasn't so much roti, but that's just cause I wasn't in the mood for it. It was a REAL dalpouri roti! Awesome!  The chickpea, kale and potato filling could have been a little saucier, but it had great flavour.  BTW, their house hot sauce is THE BOMB. So very spicy and delicious.

My BFF ordered the walnut, quinoa, mushroom burger. I had a bite. YUM. I will order that next time. Soo good. 

We also had the raw chocolate cheesecake. OMG, it was more like a mousse but it was so amazing. Cashew cream and almond crust. I am still thinking about it. Totally addictive. Great place, I will be back VERY soon... probably for brunch."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and very relax patio, quite patio despite that it's right next to dundas street 
Menu is good, and prices are not bad, I have been here several times. I would strongly recommend this place if you can't decided where to eat out in High Park area.
Don't forget to check out the bathroom. It's extremely clean, and very nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I really like The Beet and typically would have given them 4 stars for their easy-going cafe atmosphere, friendly service, quirky ATM entranceway, nice patio, and good selection of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivorous offerings to please everyone. 

My one complaint would have been: more beets please! I'm a Dwight Schrute when it comes to getting my beety goodness. One should not be able to eat here without initially wondering if they are sick when they go to the bathroom later... beet lovers know what I'm talkin' about! But really, past visits have not been as beet-alicious as I would have hoped. A few shredded raw beets on top of a salad just will not do. Even The Beet burger could be more... beety.

But that all changed last week when I happened to be in the area and decided to pop in for a solo dinner. Sometimes a quiet meal alone is a rare joy, and this was exactly that type of occasion. When I walked in, I was greeted by a friend who works there and informed that the special that night was none other than VEGAN MAC N' CHEESE. 

Now, as a kid who was raised on Kraft dinner and person who is now ethically veg and indisputably lactose-intolerant, hearing the word \"vegan mac n' cheese\" sets off fireworks inside my head. I was able to maintain my composure and ask for a menu to review before ordering, but who are we kidding, people? I wanted that MAC like a regular Mark Morrison.

Finally, another place in this city in addition to Hogtown & Sadie's is doing a vegan mac n' cheese and by far the best one as well! It was not just 100% Daiya but a nice smooth roux with spices. The flavour is not too overpowering or greasy. Really nice cheese to macaroni ration. Top marks. 

And as if they read my mind about the beet shortage, the special soup was a beety, smooth borscht with cashew cream.

The Beet, which has always been in my good books, moved to greatness on this night. They have apparently added even more vegan menu items, making it an easy choice for dining with non-veg friends. Their strong commitment to local and fresh foods continues to impress me."}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for a while. We finally gave it a try and although the space is gorgeous; earthy, fresh and welcoming, I was a little disappointed with the food.  It was just okay for me, not terrible. I've heard it can be inconsistent from some regulars so perhaps we went on the wrong day. I'm willing to give it another go but not eager to get myself back there. The food was tasteless for me. The dishes were either bland or overly salted which is strange when using a variety of herbs. I really wanted to like his place!"}
{"text":"Auto gratuity on take out?  Not cool.  Only ordered 4 entrees (total $70).  I'd like to have the option of gratuity for service especially when there is NO SERVICE during take out.  I probably would have left gratuity anyways during the payment process but auto adding for takeout on a relatively small order is just plain robbery and arrogance.  The food is expensive for the portions to begin with.  I will be avoiding this place simply due to principle."}
{"text":"Popped in for a coffee and snack while Heather was getting a mani/pedi down the street.

While I got a good vibe from The Beet and will likely return, a few things kept it from jumping into the 4 star range.  Foremost, it was hot in there... uncomfortably so, to the point even staff members commented (twice) on how hot it was.  It wouldn't have been a big issue -- I don't need AC to be happy -- if there were more airflow, but the layout doesn't really allow that.  So it felt kind of stagnant and stifling, not ideal when you want to relax.

Still, the coffee was very good, some of the best I've had in the city, and the vegan banana-choco muffin was fantastic.  In fact, hell, now that I think about it, it was the best muffin I've had in the city!  Not that I eat many muffins... but, man, it was tasty.  Highly recommended!

Outside of the coffee and muffin, some things of note:

*  Limited beer list (Mill Street staples), of which I never saw a price and wasn't inclined to ask.
*  Long list of smoothies, priced at $6 12oz and $8 16oz, as I recall.  They all sounded delicious, but it was a bit more than I was looking to spend on a tide-me-over, especially considering I had a smoothie for breakfast (and I make hellagood smoothies myself!).
*  Almost everything on the menu is organic.  This alone helps justify the slightly higher than avg pricing.  Not sure what the \"not organic\" would be, but I will suspect staples like pepper, butter, etc... could be wrong.
*  It has a patio, though not covered (only reason I stayed inside... I'm pasty and burn way too easily).  All other customers were out there, so I was suffering alone with the staff!  It bears mentioning that I saw plenty of delighted faces when these more fortunate patrons were biting into their various tasties courtesy of The Beet.  Makes me want to try items off their menu.

So, in closing, a 3 star... for now.  It's definitely on the list of places to visit when I'm next in the Junction, and I suspect it could easily push into the 4 star range.  Certainly all signs point to \"yes\" on that note so, even as I type, I look forward to a return!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's been happening to The Beet lately :(
I've reviewed The Beet before, it used to be one of my favourite places in the city and as a celiac person I always felt that I could safely eat there. Even though it's not a guaranteed gluten-free restaurant, they've always been so mindful of my allergy and the food never used to disappoint, as of late it's been a totally different story. 
I brought my boyfriend to The Beet for the first time yesterday and he ordered the bison burger, which they were out of, but they said they'd substitute beef. This isn't something I'd usually complain about, we live in a very high food cost world, but bison is a lot more expensive than beef (to my knowledge) and they still charged us $16 for the burger that came with 6 potato wedges plus the extra fee for cheese, I thought maybe that could've been absorbed in the cost of the meat difference. 
The service used to be great but now I find the servers always seem very scattered and inattentive and everything takes a while. Last time I was in, my salad took 40 minutes to get to me and ended up having croutons in it. I thought it was a one time sub-par experience but I'm worried things are changing at my once go-to place, I hope things go back to normal :("}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of brunch with a friend today on the patio at The Beet. I've been there for lunch and dinner before but this was my first time ordering from the breakfast/brunch section of their menu. They have a pretty small menu so I quickly decided on their huevos rancheros with a special request for my eggs to be more on the well done side. I'm pleased to say they were perfectly cooked upon arrival. I haven't had this dish before so I can't compare it to another restaurant but The Beet's version was really delicious by my standards. The layers of egg, cheese, avocado were freshly arranged on a soft tortilla and accompanied by a crisp side salad. I had coffee with my meal but they have a nice selection of fresh juices on their menu as well. Service was pretty good as always and prices are reasonable so I left feeling reminded of why I like this little restaurant so much."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk through the door,--the  aroma of fresh, mouth watering food excites the senses. My sister had the burger ( excellent) and I had the Vegan Thai Rice Bowl 15$,--it was very delicious and bursting with flavour and freshness. I look forward to trying everything on the menu. We ended our meal with the perfect vegan chocolate chip peanut butter cookie!!! Yum yum and yum!! An added bonus you feel good when you're done your food,--this is how food is supposed to taste!!! 5 stars for fresh food quality, inspiring flavour combinations, fun atmosphere, menu with lots of variety, and excellent location."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food. Cute, cozy patio. Service is inconsistent, some servers are very friendly and helpful, while others are on the opposite spectrum. Overall, if you want to eat healthy at Junction, this is your place."}
{"text":"I used to work for The Beet but long before that I was and continue to be a devoted patron. This place knocks my socks off with it's great and easy selection of fantastic food that never ceases to amaze me. The staff is just as kind and caring when you're a customer to when you work there, real class act people who are fantastic at there jobs. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great healthy and supremely tasty eating experience."}
{"text":"I've been about 17 times, & as much as I love the food, the service is GODAWFUL. We'd take a seat on the patio & typically wait 30 mins to even get water & a drink order in.
I hope they look at becoming a bit more organized with the way they serve tables... If this changed it could be one of my fav places to eat!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy having a healthy option like this in the neighbourhood. A great place to bring health-conscious friends or people with any sort of food restriction. 

The down sides: 
- They seem to raise prices every couple of months while reducing portion sizes. 
- Quality is not consistent. 
- Service is not consistent. 

I come here occasionally but would come much more if the experience was consistent. Sometimes I have a great time, but sometimes they forget your order or give you a latte that is only one inch full etc. If they could work out the organization of the kitchen and attention to detail this place would be a 4.5."}
{"text":"4 star food, service, and vibe.  Very vegan friendly.

The really good (4-5 star):
vegan beet soup
vegan wraps
service & vibe

The ok (3 star):
vegan tiramisu cheesecake -- little resemblance to tiramisu
vegan mac and cheese -- not very \"cheesy\", more like a light \"creamy\"
Both are 3 star mainly because they've been mislabeled.  Otherwise they would have deserved 4.

The bad (2 star):
vegan hot chocolate -- watery, no flavor.  Not unexpected, but I had my hopes up, especially since we were sitting outside in the cold as they were completely packed inside.

No complaints from anyone else at the table.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I used to love the beet....oh dear beet what happened! Last 3 visits a disappointment... Bad slow service, orders wrong then not up to snuff when they arrive ( an hour for my salad??) maybe it's new management not sure what it is but won't go back...which is a shame as hubby and I used to go regularly.."}
{"text":"The foods I have tried were the veggie burger, tofu n' avocado wrap and the vegan mac n' cheese. All were very delicious. The side for the burger was potato and sweet potato wedges. 

I've only eaten indoors and feel comfortable. Although I smell a lot of different herbs and/or spices,  it doesn't bother me. If your sensitive to smell you may not be okay with sitting in but do try the food for take-out !"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner at The Beet and have always found the food consistently great.
I really love their Huevo Rancheros ,Salads and the Skirt Steak sandwich!
I love that I get to eat a good meal that is healthy too!
The staff and quality are always consistently great and there is a nice patio to sit on during warm weather."}
{"text":"The place is definitely worth a visit. Food quality is excellent and the atmosphere is warm and cozy. Would be a interesting place to visit during the summer."}
{"text":"Had a difficult time narrowing down my choice, too many great sounding options to choose from. I ended up splitting the steak sandwich (which was tender and satisfying), and the buenos dias wrap ( added chicken) which was also delicious. I'll be back despite the slower service we had tonight.. She just didn't seem very efficient but, we weren't in a rush & she gave good recommendations. Food & menu will keep me loyal"}
{"text":"Good food and great location. Went for brunch and they great options for gluten free meals. We had the grilled cheese, the plant burger and the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Came back today and tried a brunch. The service is slow, really, but food is very very good. 

I find this place a bit confusing. When you come inside, the first thing you see is a TD bank lobby with an ATM machine, so you think you have gone to the wrong place. But it's their lobby, and you finally manage to go to their lounge. 

Their space is also messy, has a wall dividing it (I don't know why, makes it feel even smaller), they try to be an organic market, but they're really not - they only sell a few things on the counter, which is a mess. 

I'd suggest sitting on their patio, but today was raining and this was not an option - and probably the service will be even s-l-o-w-e-r 

Well, at least the food is good and healthy."}
{"text":"I'm home!!!! The food at The Beet is absolutely incredible. Fresh, vegan, organic, beautifully seasoned food priced well. How can you beat that? I ordered The famer's market salad. My bf, the carnivore at times, ate most of the salad! We ordered the huevos rancheros-ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh!!!! Freaking aaaahhh -maze -iiing. We also both had freshly made beet juice, which we drank out of wine glasses! How cute is that!! I ordered the tofu and avocado sandwich to go which was so good, it comes with the beet salad with an incredible dressing. The only downside was the service could do with some improvement. It's a little place on a corner but, charming all the same. I plan on returning here on my next visit to try some different items! Everything was Veggielicious! Your tastebuds will be doing the happy dance at The Beet. I wish there was one in L.A or San Deigo! *humph* :/"}
{"text":"Ordered two smoothies for my friend and I. They were tasty and we could feel every ingredient on our palette.  But for $11.00 for a 16oz I expect my cup to be filled to the top! Not impressed."}
{"text":"Very disappointing vegan kale ceaser . Dressing was bland and they didn't use a lot. The croutons were just sitting dry on top and not tossed in with the dressing. They were very hard and dry and also bland. Not appealing. Basically it was like eating kale with a bit of oil on it with dry bread cubes. And randomly with daiya cheddar added, which makes no sense. 

The service also wasn't the best. Our drink order was brought to the table next to us (they arrived after us and got our drinks). And then the server tried to bring that table their actual drinks, but they already had our drinks so she just gave us their drinks. I asked if they were americanos and she she didn't know what she was holding. After a quick check she said they were, but I don't think they were. And if they were americanos they weren't good. Very weak. 

Veggie burger was ok. Disappointing and dry side salad."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, extremely loud, very tight and squishy, small portions, extremely expensive, and average meal. I definitely do not recommend this place, save your money."}
{"text":"This is such a great neighborhood restaurant, I can't even begin to say how much I appreciate this place. It's very casual and cozy with lovely, warm staff who serve yummy organic food. What more can anyone ask for?"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for healthy food in the Junction! Reasonable prices and a great variety of vegetarian options in a cozy setting! 

I highly recommend the vegan thai rice bowl and the veggie burger, which comes with a side salad. The portions are a good size and the ingredients are so fresh and flavourful. 

There's lots of other great sounding menu options that I still need to try :)"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the TD bank entrance that leads you into the yummy goodness of the Beet.  This place is an adorably fetching little eatery, that kinda reminds you of your hippy friend from university, y'know, the one who had that eclectically mad charming kitchen and who would churn out those awesome healthy/vegan optional meals.

  Really though the Beet a nicely chillaxed and casual space, and I'm a little dissappointed we didn't get to sit and eat here as we only had time to do it take-out style and surprisingly the wait was very short for both mine and hubby's meals. 
 I'm docking a star though for pricing a la $32 bucks for takeout lunch for two?!  But I will say that my vegan Island Roti was really flavourful, filling and large portioned.
 Hubby did also really enjoy his Organic Fenwood Farms chicken roasted BBQ wrap with gusto.

 Also worth noting the Beet have an extensive line-up of smoothie selections, and they stock a good selection of organic local bevvies like the gluten-free Nickel Brook beer, and my new fave drink, the amazing Toronto based Kombucha Tonica, which is a lot like a wine spritzer on a green tea note.

 Yes, the Beet is pricey, but still I'll give mad props to the Beet for their enthusiastic efforts to support local organic growers and suppliers.  Overall, the Beet is a cool little Junction spot that offers a wholesomely tasty gluten-free and vegan friendly menu."}
{"text":"Expensive. $60 with tax and tip for tap water, 2 sandwiches, a kids meal ($9 for a peanut butter sandwich) and 1 orange juice that was 50% foam (maybe you need a slow press juicer). 

Was told that there were no potato wedges left but when I went up to pay, there was an order being plated that was piled high with wedges. 

Staff seems as though they couldn't care any less if you were there or not. 

Ate here two years ago and had the same experience. Went in hoping things had changed. They have not."}
{"text":"I like The Beet very much, not because the food is amazingly stellar, but because the coffee, the side patio and the concept are fantastic. The organic, local cafe has an interesting menu that will please vegans, vegetarians and carnivores (like me). I have enjoyed the huevos rancheros twice, they are fresh, but small, and on the pricey side indeed. I recommend the Beet, with hesitation, only because the price and the portion size are not always in sync."}
{"text":"As a meat eater this place is great place to go especially with my vegan friends. Had plenty of selection and the quality of food is exceptional"}
{"text":"The food was really good and server was kind and attentive.  Over 45min wait on the weekend for brunch though and the tables were really close together.  We could hear the entire conversation of the people beside us.  Try and go during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like my meal here. I was so excited when I looked at the menu and saw so many healthy and tasty sounding choices. But sadly my tofu and avocado wrap disappointed. The flavours weren't that great, and also I hate when sandwiches containing tomato get heated (perhaps just personal preference... but I find it just makes everything soggy). 

Positives: the side salad was great, the strawberry banana smoothie was pretty good, the decor was cute, and overall the cafe had a great vibe. I'm looking forward to coming back again and hopefully having better luck with the food."}
{"text":"Great healthy food in this up-and-coming neighborhood! I had brunch here and was immediately drawn to almost every menu item. They have a nice selection of juices, good coffee, cocktails, and everything served is high-quality food with an attentiveness to dietary restrictions and overall healthy offerings. Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The Beet is a fantastic option for a delicious, healthy take out meal. I haven't yet eaten in their new location (the old Passenger in the Junction), but can't wait to enjoy the patio this summer. 
Had take-away for lunch today. I called ahead and ordered for 3. It was ready as I walked in 10 minutes later. We had the BBQ chicken wrap, the steak sammie and the buenos dias bowl. 
My friends who had the wraps said they loved them! The bowl I ordered was huge, and I have left overs for a snack later :)
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Beet has a nice variety of yummy and healthy food.  They don't shy away from serving meat which is great as many of these healthy food places are also vegetarian.  
The space is kind of small so may not be the best place to go when you are with a lot of people.  
The staff is very friendly and helpful.  
The shakes are a bit pricey but delicious and they have a very nice selection of teas.  I took my Mom there for Mother's Day and we both really enjoyed it. 
If you buy something next door at the furniture store (Forever Interiors) he might give you a discount coupon, worth asking."}
{"text":"I was treated to a delicious lunch here & it was lovely.  Our server was calm, friendly, & informative.  My meal was so delicious.  It isn't the cheapest place to eat - but I felt so nourished.  It was a stress-free place to eat where we both knew we'd be well taken care of as far as options went."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of eating out for brunch.
We went to The Junction to get an early start on our Sunday activities, but we had to wait until the 10am opening.  By 10:15am the place was pretty full.
We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the Breakfast Bowl.  Both meals were delicious.
When the person you're with says, \"I can't remember the last time I've felt this full\", that's saying something."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for brunch on Sundays, particularly if you have friends that have all sorts of food sensitivities.  

The Beet is easy to walk past - the front entrance there is a TD ATM (from what I can tell, and from what people say, it used to be a TD bank?).

The food - every time I go with people here, I always seem to order the wrong things, because everyone else at the table is often oooohing and ahing at how good their food is!  Their vegan mac and cheese is no replacement for the real thing - the cheese tastes a little bit strange.  The quinoa/mushroom burger is actually good - it's the first veggie burger patty that I've had that hasn't crumbled to pieces, and the meat simulation is pretty convincing.  My fiance constantly orders the huevos rancheros and swears by them (plus the blue cheese walnut sausage).  For brunch for 2 people, it often works out to be around $40-$50, which seems to be slightly pricey.

As far as I know - no reservations, but the wait is never too long (and they typically call you so you can wander about outside.)

Also note: because the kitchen is in the same area as the dining area, all of your clothes smell like cooking smells after you leave.  

I like the local art that they put up on the walls as well."}
{"text":"It's the same thing EVERYTIME I go here. The service is terrible. The staff are off on their own planet. Left after waiting to even speak to a waiter. And I've done that in the past as well. They should just make this a take out joint and fire all the hipster idiot waitstaff."}
{"text":"The Beet is sort of hard to find - you have to walk through a TD ATM to get to it, but once you're inside, an exciting menu of take-away (or eat-in) specials awaits you! There is a rotating selection of daily specials like soups, stews and sandwich, both vegetarian/vegan and not. There's a small dining area where you can enjoy a meal or a drink and in the summer there's a bushel of organic produce for sale.

I've ordered the veggie burger multiple times and it's outrageous. It's a cross between your typical \"meat analogue\" burger and \"heartier\" vegetable-based veggie burgers. I think there are chickpeas and other beans in it, by the taste of it. It's served with a young greens salad, finely grated carrots, and of course, beets! Yum."}
{"text":"Pricey for the amount you receive, but the food  quality is good. Cozy nook for harsh weather days. Love their massive smoothies/drinks menu. Comfy vintage-restored laid back hipster ambience."}
{"text":"Put the breaks on quick when we saw \"organic\" written on the patio deck! Just what we were searching for on the last of our summer days! Although we didn't last outside due to the wasps, we very much enjoyed the atmosphere inside as well! I ordered a wrap and my mom got the vegan burger. Everything was amazing. Service was prompt and friendly and prices are decent. Two meals and a beer for 35$. Can't go wrong whe it'll it tastes that good!"}
