{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened. I finally got to try it today for brunch with a foodie friend and we were not disappointed! For my full review, visit: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/yummy-lebanese-brunch-now-available-in-downtown-montreal/"}
{"text":"I had a Chicken Taouk with Fatoush and hummus. The sandwich was baked in the oven. 
Also the hummus is real hummus and not a mix with tahini. Everything came out really good, first time I see this in Montreal.

Highly recommended to come and try it out!
Also a great coffee"}
{"text":"It's named after a coastal city in the Mediterranean, where I used to pass all my childhood summers.
The first time I heard about it, I bookmarked it on my list of recommended restaurants to go. When my friends proposed to go for a brunch I suggested this place.
When we arrived there, the manager greeted us he was very friendly and the waitress was really nice and cheerful.
He recommended us to share several manoushes; a Cheese and Turkey Roll,  
Meat Kafta and Cheese, Thyme for Cheese, Lahmajin, Chocolate Halewe, eggs in a pan and Halloumi. 
It was yummy! The manoushe dough was unbeatable!
Not to forget the delicious lebanese coffee in a rakweh!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place didn't turn out to be what I expected. I order the most basic thing on the menu \"zaatar manaouche\" and didn't even get it hot like it was freshly baked (not sure if it stayed on the counter for too long after being baked). And somehow it still took forever to get my 1 item order. And for some reason they decided to put tomatoes and olives in it when I clearly never asked for any. Considering the price they barley had enough zaatar on there. So it basically tasted mostly like bread. The place is so new and there is no indication of what the take-out process is as far as where to wait and where to go. And the staff doesn't tell you either so you have to guess or wait awkwardly around the place. I was really hoping to have found a place that I can just pick up a manaouche on the way to work for cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Je n'avais jamais fait de \" brunch libanais \" jusqu'à présent, c'est maintenant chose faite !

Je me suis rendue chez Jouney avec deux amies un samedi midi (lors d'une tempête de neige). Apparemment, l'endroit est souvent bondé mais ce jour-là nous étions les seules à avoir eu le courage de braver le froid.

Nous avons commandé plusieurs plats à partager : du hummus, des ufs, un manouche au thym, du labney, du lahmajin... c'était convivial et plein de saveurs ! Ils proposent également du café libanais ainsi que du jus d'oranges pressées, bref tout le nécessaire pour un brunch bien réussi. 

Petite mention spéciale au personnel fort sympathique qui nous a offert un dessert (chocolate halewe) à la fin de notre brunch."}
{"text":"As a lebanese this place is my absolute favourite manouché in town. It's not too heavy and full of flavour. Bravo for the cheese texture and recipe that is really difficult to master (I had long discussions with my friends about that).
This place gets a special place thanks to its brown dough that is out of this world taste wise, even better than the white one !
Also, usually I avoid the things that look fancy and made up like hummus with flavors but last time I was adventurous and I tried the muhammara one. Wow! A nutty taste, that is super good with their (surprisingly delicious too) crackers !
And for desert you should get the rice pudding, it's nothing like your regular rice pudding, it tastes like lebanon.
Just avoid the eggs they are nothing special... A little bland in comparison with the rest.

Ah, also super friendly staff :D"}
{"text":"An amazing Lebanese coffee in the heart of downtown. The environment is unique and original. It is a mix of Lebanese wood furniture style and the warm brick walls \"A la souche\".

If you need a coffee or a quick breakfast, I suggest you give it a shot."}
