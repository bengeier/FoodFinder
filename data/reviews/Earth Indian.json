{"text":"I ate there once,  and again and again and again. I just fell in love with the food. Nothing extra ordinary but so homely that you can eat there again and again. I always order for pick up,  bring the yummy food home and eat in the comfort of my house. One must try daal maharaani here."}
{"text":"Just had this and it was great! Delivery was super fast and arrived still hot. We ordered tikka chicken , butter chicken , pilau rice , naans and samosas. The tikka chicken came with green peppers and onions which I really liked and the samosas were really tasty. Big portions too!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Uber Eats. Got Chicken Tikka, Tandoori chicken and naan and one of the platters that came with a samosa and some other stuff. The platter stuff all tasted like it was really old and just reheated. The chicken Tikka was mostly just sauce and the chicken in it tasted dry and not fresh. The tandoori chicken was the only thing worth eating. Waste of $43 though, won't order from there again."}
{"text":"The best Indian place we've found north of Eglinton - they do excellent tandoori, and I've always enjoyed their Vindaloo. It's a family run place with a nice atmosphere, a pleasant staff that give you good recommendations when you ask. Also nice is that the food comes pretty quick.

If you've been to their old location, the new one is much better - and the food continues to please!"}
{"text":"We've tried many indian restaurants in the North York/ Thornhill area and this is by far the best!  Flavourful dishes with just the right amount of spice requested.  Good prices and not stingy with portion sizes and the amount of meat or paneer in each dish."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from Earth Indian but would not order from them again.

The Badami Murgh Tikka was so salty I had to wrap naan around it just to get it down. Really bad.

The traditional chicken tikka was very good. 

Naan was excellent, large portions. Steamed rice was same as anywhere else, perfectly fine.

One of the chicken dishes had oil/liquid seeping out if the container and the dish itself.

Food was not the type to entice a second try, unfortunately. However, other reviewers seem to like it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for here and I'm quite impressed. I don't understand why they don't have much reviews so I'm writing it.
I ordered Mild Butter Chicken, Spicy Paneer Makhani, Garlic Naan, Roti, and Gulab Jamun. 
Mild Butter Chicken is just good as I expected, nice buttery and creamy taste. It has huge chicken chunks even enough to share with two people. 
I wanted some hot kick so I made Paneer Makhani to spicy and it was the best choice ever. Paneer Makhani has Indian cheese, Paneer, in a cube shape and this is just perfect with spicy. I highly recommend this one.
The best thing about their curry is you can decide its spicy level (mild, medium, spicy)
Naan was just perfect nothing to complain.
Gulab Jamun, Indian dessert, was not bad but not my favorite. I don't mean it's not good.

I placed an order at the last minute of closing but they delivered to my house which was so kind. Food was all nicely packed, hot enough and the owner is friendly :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Indian food, and this is probably the best I've ever had!

I got a great deal on a set dinner for 2 through one of the many group deal websites (which I am addicted to for my sins).  Appetizer platter for 2 to share, 3 main dishes (2 meat and 1 veg), rice and excellent naan bread, and 1 dessert to share for $19!!!  Amazing deal, unfortunately you may never get one like it again for this particular restaurant.

Having said that, the regular price of $41.95 for this prix fixe meal (for 2 people) is just chump change when you taste the quality of the food.  My wife and I were blown away by all 3 mains, and the samosas that came with the platter were like little fluffy clouds of veggie heaven.

I don't really think any Indian restaurant I've been to does desserts the way I want them, so I'm not critiquing that part of the meal.  The Chicken Lababdar was \"die happy\" good, as was the Eggplant Patiala, and there was a healthy portion of rice and naan to soak up all the flavour.  Keep an eye out for this place if you are in the hood."}
{"text":"Good news for those of us North-Yorkers who are lamenting the recent closing of Cuisine of India:

Earth Indian Restaurant is tucked into the main floor of an apartment building on the north-east corner of Yonge Street and Cummer Avenue (immediately south of the Dodge dealership).

Their menu is very similar to Cuisine of India's - for example chicken lababdar & palak paneer, and they tasted great on our visit.  And the naan is also terrific (maybe a bit more butter than absolutely necessary, but still great).

And the portions are very generous.  Definitely in the take-home-for-lunch-the-next-day category.

Service was also very attentive and the premises themselves (once you find them!) are very pleasant. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Earth Indian last Sunday evening using Ubereats. My food was pretty good, I ordered Butter chicken, rice and naan. My butter chicken portion and taste was really good, but my rice portion was small and my naan tasted very flourly. I would definitely order from here again, except I wouldn't order naan"}
{"text":"First off: I've only been here to use up my coupons. 

To be honest, the location (a few blocks north of the Finch subway station, on Yonge Street) is out of the way for us downtown denizens. So I'd put off and put off and put off using those coupons until my trusty reminder popped up to say I'd better use 'em or lose 'em.

So, my friend and I thought it over, discussed the logistics of getting there on a weekday ... not gonna happen, she works too far away. And then we noticed we had the option of take-out! Problem solved.

So, on three different occasions (I had 3 coupons and the coupons clearly stated that only ONE could be used each day for take-out), we ordered take-out. Decided to skip the naan and biryani dishes since I had both at home. 

The first attempt: Chicken xacutti and lamb vindaloo. Both were perfect! The vindaloo (labelled as \"spicy\") smelled a little strongly of vinegar, and wasn't very spicy: even my friend who doesn't eat spicy food was only moderately zinged. The chicken was velvety perfection - a rich, roasted-coconut flavour (not coconut milk, this is fresh grated coconut) in a variety of spices. The verdict: A1 for flavour!

The second attempt: we wanted seafood. Ordered the bombay macchi (fish in a tomatoey sauce) and the Goan fish and prawns. The Bombay macchi was blah to my taste buds, but my friend loved it. The Goan fish and prawns reminded me of the xacutti the previous time - delicious!

The third attempt was the weirdest. Having seen the portion sizes on the first two attempts, we were sure there'd be plenty of food (in both cases, we'd had leftovers). So we ordered the Bombay Bakra (curried goat) and the Hara Chicken Tikka. This time, I was starving, so stopped at a little hole-in-the-wall Indian place near my house to get some naan and a vegetable dish: a good thing, too. The chicken tikka was just a few pieces, and the goat dish was about half the volume of the previous curries we'd ordered, although the price was about the same.

I don't know if it's just that that particular goat dish is a small serving or if they have changed the portion sizes for take-out, but both of us were rather disappointed with that particular order. Tasty, but certainly not filling.

I'm still rating this a 4 - the food is delicious and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that one smaller-than-expected dish."}
{"text":"Very happy with the friendly greeting and food quality. 
Great paneer, vindaloo and I love the Ras Malai. 

Today I tried something new, the Bombay Bakra, which is lamb in ginger, onions. Wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Great indian food, super nice staff, plus they always have nice indian songs playing in the store. I have to agree with the other reviewer, this is the best Indian restaurant in North York."}
{"text":"I am an Indian guy and am pretty familiar with different cuisines from India. 

I came down from Boston (USA) for a business trip and tried this place after reading the reviews on Yelp.

To be honest with you, This place is not good at all.. I tried many places in USA, this is worst of all. I have ordered Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Biryani. 


 Chicken Vindaloo is OK. I have specifically asked them to make spicy and hot. It was bland for me. Chicken Biryani was a disaster. I don't know why they have used raisins in Biryani!! Absolutely wrong. The thing that pissed me off is .. they don't provide any gravy or Raita with the Biryani. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM SEEING A RESTAURANT WHERE THEY DON'T PROVIDE GRAVY AND RAITA WITH THE BIRYANI. Above all, Biryani is spicy but doesn't give any taste.

Absolutely ridiculous.. 
Anyway, If you are not all familiar with Indian food and just want something Indian.. you can try this."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever with this below par restaurant and their super inefficient \"manager\" Chandra. I placed an order through a reputed website, which I have used for 5 years with no problems and they messed up my order. When I called back after not receiving the order for 2 hours, I had to call repeatedly for 20 minutes because no one picks up the phone in this restaurant. Finally a very confused girl picked up the phone and upon inquiry said \"oh the driver has left already and it will be another 25 minutes\", which is funny coz the restaurant is 5 km from my house. Anyways, I waited for 30 more minutes with no food in sight. I called back again, angry & frustrated because my 7 year old had been waiting for food for the last 2 hours. The lady on the phone was not apologetic,extremely rude and utterly dumb. She kept saying \"Listen to me...i dont have your order...call the website....if i dont have an order will I dream of making your food\", although the first girl said she saw the order and it was out for delivery. I was appalled at the \"manager's\" indifference. She refused to believe me, although I kept saying it cant be the website because the confirmation came from you. Of course, by that I time I should have realized that I was dealing with an absolute imbecile who had no idea how the whole process works. She hung up on me, saying \"call the website\". 

I called the website and they confirmed there was a mix up at the restaurant and someone messed up my order and advised the customer care guy from the website that \"it will take another hour\" for them to deliver the food. The guy gave me a credit for the hassle and said I will ask them to expedite, although I know that it is not gonna do anything coz they are a bunch of inefficient people running a circus in the name of a restaurant. 

So amidst all the chaos, my only hope was that the food would be good, at least edible. Regarding the food, the less said the better. The biryani was dry as if someone just threw some leftover rice in chicken curry. The lamb was tough and rubbery and the Tandoori Chicken looked malnutritioned.  

After all the hassle and ruining my Friday evening with these fine people I was treated to food which was worse than dog food.

This place is an embarrassment to Indian Food, but of course even if you tolerate the food, the inefficient staff is intolerable."}
{"text":"Good selection of Indian food. We arrived early for dinner at 4:40 pm, the restaurant only opens for dinner @ 5:00.  Place was empty for the start of dinner with the exception of one other couple.  Food was excellent and portions seemed larger than what I'm used to.  Butter chicken was a little more tomato-y than I'm typically used to,  but was still awesome with the basmati rice and garlic naan.  

Also remember to try cheetah DARK lager with your meal.  Would definitely recommend the restaurant for the quality of the food... give it a try."}
{"text":"I remembered this restaurant from the TV Show Restaurant Makeover, and I love the indian food here, I was sad to see Cuisine of India go away but I'm glad that we have this high quality Indian restaurant tucked away at the bottom of an apartment building right here in North York.

Food here is very flavourful and I agree with Brune B.'s review which states that the service here is neither fast nor slow, but I think good food that is made from scratch takes a while so sit back relax enjoy the ambiance and talk with your partner for a while when you are waiting for your food.

The menu is extensive and can be challenging to know what to order if you have never tried indian food before, but ask the server and he's more than willing to help you out to explain what is spicy and what isn't.

Indian food being as elegant as it is there are vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options here, you will have to work with your server to explain to them what you can and cannot consume and they will be willing to modify ingredients to your taste / choice of lifestyle."}
{"text":"Excellent indian food!  Definitely worth checking out.  Great service as well.  We hosted a private family event at their old location in 2011 and everyone loved the food.  They handled the occasion details very well and we were extremely pleased."}
{"text":"There are a few options for lunch diners from the $4.99 vegetarian combo, $5.99 meat combo, or the full out buffet for $10.99 

The menu selections change daily from what I've observed the few times I've gone. 
I welcome the change though. All the dishes has been consistently fresh. 

Sometimes it's curry goat, sometimes beef curry, sometimes they have a kidney bean daal, or today it was yellow split pea daal, sometimes pakoras, tandoori chicken or tandoori fish.

But you can count on thing... Butter Chicken and Basmati rice!!  Always a crowd favorite. ;)

The naan was a lot better this time around, it was soft and fluffy and the rice pudding dessert with almond shavings was also excellent! 

Like the variety and the quiet dining atmosphere here. This is now my go to spot for Indian in the area.

Suggest if you visit at lunch sit close to the windows, it's a lot brighter as I find it's a bit dim near the center of the dining room."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good Indian restaurant in North America, but this ladies and gentleman is a gem! What caught my eye is that they have a dish named 'Goat Amritsari' and if an Indian restaurant has a goat dish you know it's legit. So when i placed the first order with them I pigged out and ordered sooo much that my bill was a $100 and mind you this was only for my wife and I! The food was excellent and Earth Indian has become one of my go-to restaurants! A must try is the Prawn Balchao!"}
{"text":"Nan is very fresh and good! 

We had lunch buffet here. Other food seemed just ok for us. The variety is not that much.
Like the sweet potato dessert is good."}
{"text":"Hidden away from any restaurant area. But one of the most flavorful Indian food I have eaten. Always freshly prepared, lots of space and wonderful ambience. Perfect for those night when one craves good food in a decent setting."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Best lamb I have ever had. Clearly, one of the better Indian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Best naan in Toronto, buffet is a good deal."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I've had so far. The chef is amazing. Family run joint with a quaint spot enough for at least 20 customers. 

They do have some dishes that I haven't noticed on other indian restaurant menu's before so points for the originality.

favourite dishes
 - Peas, Mushrooms and Paneer. - delicious. The broth is creamy but not runny. Paneer is big cubes and plenty of bite in one spoon. 

- Saag with chicken - Ah-mazing!. The broth is made of spinach and quite flavourful with chicken pieces.

 The staff, always extremely friendly and now that we've become regulars we get to vote on what Indian movie they get to play on the big t.v. Huzza, we've made it to the big time!

{"text":"Today I ordered delivery. I was pleased that they took my order & delivered the food fast even before their normal delivery hours.
The food arrived very hot & fresh. 
I orderes garlic naan & butter chicken. 
I put 4 stars only that souse for butter chicken was way too liquidish, but taste was all right."}
{"text":"Fairly solid spot.  In search of a new Indian Restuarant after my move to Yonge and Sheppard area.  I have ordered the Daal (huge Daal fan!) about 3-4 times to go.  Also have eaten the butter chicken, and the chicken Vindaloo.  Not bad.  Not the absolute best Indian in Toronto, but one of the better Indian restaurants from what I see... Real Indian people who look like they know whats up seem to frequent here, so how bad can it be?!"}
{"text":"Having been in Toronto for over a year, I hated having to go all the way out to Brampton for good Indian food. This place was found by sheer luck.

Mr. H was looking for an Indian restaurant for delivery and came across this place. We ordered a Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka and some naan. The Butter Chicken is the best I've had and the fact that the Chicken Tikka Masala had a very distinct flavour of its own was commendable. It was also very tasty. Over time we tried their Samosa's (yumm!), Papri Chaat (awesome) and Lamb curry (yumm!). The place is now our go-to when craving Indian food. The have great combo option for dinner and I look forward to trying more items from the menu. 

Definitely try this place, it's authentic Indian food at a good price!"}
{"text":"I came here with my bf and another couple for belated bday's and just an all-around-get-together. For a Friday night (8pm), the place was nearly empty except for a group of 6. 

FYI! There is parking right beside the restaurant. It's accessible by entering a code to get the bar to raise (code is pasted right on the keypad).

Intro. When you walk in, smells of Indian food and incense hit you. Nice and warm for a cold, blistery night. It was pretty dark inside and the zen-like music did not do anything to get me excited. 

My friends and I decided to get the Dinner for 4 combo which comes with an appetizer dish (fried assortments of Pakora, Samosa, and Paneer) as well as 5 dishes. It also comes with rice and Naan. I initially thought the dishes were quite small and that we would not be stuffed, but silly me, we ended up having to take away the food. My favorite dish by far was the Eggplant, Cauliflower, and this dish from Goa (prawns) smothered in a rich, creamy, cocunt-y sauce. All the food was washed down with a bottle of Reisling, which was very reasonably priced at $28.

Generally speaking, nothing special, but good food nonetheless. I don't think I am an expert on Indian food as I wouldn't know what would be considered good, or otherwise. If you happen to be in the area (Yonge and Finch-ish) and you don't feel like Korean, Asian, or Wings, then perhaps you would want to try Earth India."}
{"text":"Great food
Friendly pricing
Fresh ingredients 

Friendly staff

Best value for money

Great choice for vegetarians

Chef GAGAN is amazing. I am coming each week"}
{"text":"The food's really good and pretty cheap. 
They do more delivery & pick-ups than dine-ins so the interior decoration leaves a lot to be desired. 
The eggplant lunch special is a delight."}
{"text":"Possibly the best palak paneer I've ever had.

BUT, the order took an hour an a half to be delivered to my house that is no more than 10 minutes away from the restaurant. When I ordered, I was told 45 minutes. 

It wasn't cold when it got here, but damn near close. Barely lukewarm. 

Also, if my paneer dish doesn't come with rice, please tell me that when I order - many dishes come with rice. I don't like the surprise of having no rice with my meal.

Their soup was fantastic too. Really, no complaints about the food, just the service."}
{"text":"Another one of our favs!  Food is excellent and quality!  Another regular for us until we moved out of area.  In fact we lived them so much we used them for our wedding reception (our second one as we had an Island wedding out of country in Jamaica). Only suggestion is their prawn curry use to be perfect and then it started to get over cooked the last few times I ordered.  Our fav's are the chicken lababdar and lamb vindaloo!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome..the good is great and they have combos for two that are of great value and had plenty of food for three! no buffet for dinner though..definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Had the tikka masala chicken which was great. The channa masala was very ordinary"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We ordered it for dinner and it was absolutely yummy! We tried the vegetable pakoras, vegetable samosas and butter chicken with rice and naan. All of it was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best indian restaurants i have tried in toronto. I always get my butter chicken and chicken tikka masala to go. The vibe in the restaurant is really dull and quite but the food is exceptional. They have delivery too but i think its just a certain distance. But definitely would recommend if youre a indian food fan."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food north York.  We order often and get the palak paneer , dal makhani, and chicken tikka masala.  My husband is from the South Africa and love every inch of this food. I'm Canadian born and adore all of the food.  Meets comfort food needs for the two of us. Will not go anywhere else for Indian in Toronto.oh and the Goan fish curry is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"these guys do a pretty good job with home delivery service. Please have them repeat your address as the delivery person keeps changing. Great indian food .. mutton biryani is my favorite."}
{"text":"long story short, amazing entrees overshadowed by crap service & crap appetizers .

now the long story . lets talk about the good first . the garlic naan . it was extra garlicky & extra greasy = extra yummy . possibly THEE best naan ive ever had in my life . we had the chicken lababdar & lamb vindaloo . both very very good & full of flavor . portions were huge . i had some leftover for lunch the next day . :)

now the bad . i had the mulligatawny soup since it sound interesting . bleh . i didnt like it but the bf liked it a little more than i did so he finished it . we also have the chicken pakoras for app . this, we both hated . wayy too overcooked, tiny pieces of chicken, wayy too much batter, it was almost hard to chew .

the service was pretty crap . the younger girl at the front who seemed like the hostess made it seem like she was doing us a favor and did everything from sitting us down to bringing (or more like forgetting) us our drinks w an attitude as if she does not want to be there and she was taking it out on us . Also, when i asked the server about some of the items on the menu, he just read the description of the item right off the menu . huh ? i know how to read, i just wanted to know more than what it says on the menu . when i asked him what he recommends, he just said 'everything' . nothing turns me off more . booo .

this place almost became one of my favorites AND i live by in walking distance . but we all know, almost doesnt count ."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Decor is nice.  The buffet is alright.  Serve with fresh naan.  I just hope they add more selection to the buffet"}
{"text":"With the power outage in most parts of Toronto including our neighbourhood this evening, we ventured out to eat someplace that had backup power and was open for business. Earth Indian which is in the next block to our apartment made the most of the situation by having candlelights even though they didn't have backup power they were serving 80% of the menu. The food was still as delicious as it is and service was outstanding. The chicken lababdar with the Butter Garlic Naan was finger licking good. Their food remains consistently top notch as was the service by the waiting staff who made our experience memorable."}
{"text":"Best to go here when not busy, as the kitchen may be a bit slow when they are.

Very delicious food.  Great buttered naan, excellent soup and appetizers, wonderfully hot vindaloo, and lovely madras chicken.  Main dishes come with rice which is nice as one does not need to order additional.  Very friendly and homey service.

Menu is not enormous but is quite long with a good variety of Indian dishes.  Decent list of vegetarian offerings.  Meats are halal.

We have only eaten in (note that the restaurant is very small) but they do deliver.  Not sure of the delivery area.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Friday night and craving some Indian food.  My wife and I have visited the previous location in the past and could you believe that they only moved only 200 metres north from the old location!  We didn't want to venture in our car so we walked it in the 15°C weather.

Getting to the restaurant, it is now smaller.  Whenever we drive by the restaurant, we can clearly see through the window if it is busy or empty.  Friday at 7:30PM, it was empty and we gladly took our seat by the window as the sole customers after we were greeted by the hostess/waitress.  There was a flat screen at the back of the restaurant playing an Bollywood Movie with Salman Khan which added to the atmosphere.

One of the reasons for returning was the Veggie Pakoras.  Not only are they totally crispy and deep fried, they taste great.

We wanted to get the full fixings so we ordered with Medium spice:

Vegetable Pakoras
Chicken Biriyani
Beef Jhalfrezi (comes with Basmati Rice)
Garlic Naan

Papadum (thin crisp Indian nacho-like chip) came out free as an appetizer.  Pakoras came out, 4 in total and we munched on that.  Good!

The food did not take too long, maybe about 20 minutes.  When it arrived, wow did it look delicious!  The Chicken Biriyani was a little different here.  It had chunks of chicken breast cubes made with the rice.  I am more used to the bone in dark meat but truly it was healthier and still flavourful.  The Beef Jhalfrezi was rich and saucy which had large chunks of tender beef, green pepper and onions.  The Basmati rice surely did compliment it.  The Garlic Naan was also a winner.  It had been brushed with butter and sprinkled with fresh garlic bits and parsley.  Excellent combination.  Wonderful!

The food was fresh and delicious and the hostess/waitress was nice and courteous.  If you are looking for good tasting, homely feel Indian food out of the busy North York core, look no further than Earth Indian!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here using Uber Eats. Over half an hour after the food was supposed to be delivered, it wasn't even prepared yet. We called Uber Eats twice to check on the status of the order, and in the end cancelled the order. We do not plan to order food from here again."}
{"text":"Was craving Indian food and looking for a delivery restaurant on a rainy afternoon. I came across this place and decided to try their tikka masala and lamb saag along with three orders of naan, original, cheese, and garlic. 

I found their naan to be crispier and flaky as opposed to doughy. The tikka masala which was supposed to be mild had a spicy kick but it was delicious. Lamb was pretty good too. 

Delivery took longer than expected but overall it was tasty and would keep this place on my delivery list for future Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"As this place was situated under an apartment complex with a completely unoccupied patio sitting area on a balmy summer weekend night, the first impression of this place was pretty bad. Despite the claim that they offer a \"fine dining\" experience, it evidently was not. The decor was all over the place, the tablecloth was covered by glass (probably to save money on washing them), and the napkins were paper rather than cloth. As expected of a place claiming to be fine dining but falling way short of that standard, the service was pretty terrible. The front of house and kitchen were both terribly understaffed - only one person to act as both server and host and two cooks in the kitchen. 

The server was either badly trained or simply too overwhelmed with orders to show his quality; it took him five minutes to serve drinks, another five to take orders, and thirty to get the food to the table. In the thirty minutes between taking orders and getting the food to the table, he didn't stop by our table once to check in on us, refresh our drinks, or alleviate some of our hunger by offering something that can be served as an appetizer. We had to flag him down to get a status report on our food, which turned out to be pretty good.

Even though the people in the kitchen were few, they were skilled. The fish dish that was recommended by an earlier review was spectacular, the lamb madras was really nice and creamy, the chicken vindaloo was just right, and the garlic naan was mindblowing. The portions were also generous - enough to feed a grown man and his wife and daughter, with extras to take home. The food was presented well... or so it seemed after being disappointed by the level of service received. Which really wasn't that good considering how the server basically gave us boxes to pack up our own food rather than clearing the table and packing the things we wanted to take home.

All in all, great food, horrible dining experience. Don't bother eating in. Just order the take-out."}
{"text":"My experience with this place is based on a delivery order from Orderit.ca and upon seeing the executive specials on Yelp, I think next time I will just swing by for a pick-up instead because I think the prices of their delivery services is inflated compared to their dine-in prices.  It also took 1 hour for the delivery to arrive and I was getting worried whether the food would come at all because I placed the order quite late at 10pm.

We ordered the butter chicken, vegetable korma and eggplant dish and a few sides.  I really liked everything, especially the vegetable korma.  The reason for the 3 stars is because my vegetarian friend found a piece of the butter chicken in the eggplant dish and that's a huge no-no.  There should never be meat found in dishes that are deemed vegetarian, that's not cool.  Upon seeing that this place is a buffet, it kind of makes sense that maybe the person spooning the dishes into the take-out containers got a little tired and was careless, but it is still unacceptable."}
{"text":"3.5

I was craving some Indian food and decided to try a new place.  This review focuses on delivery as that's what we got.

Pros:
Fast delivery

Cons:
Not as \"authentic\" as it could be

We ordered the butter chicken (of course), lamb korma and the xacutti chicken.  Placed the order at about 7:00pm and there was a knock on the door at about 7:30pm.  I've had pizza take longer to get to my place from a shorter distance.  The delivery guy was friendly and left before I had a chance to tip him.  I'm glad I caught him in time.  

The butter chicken was different from what I'm used to.  It's less on the creamy side and more on the tomato-y side.  I'm more a fan of creamier butter chicken but this one was still pretty good.  The main thing was there use of fenugreek.  They had by far the most fenugreek I've seen in butter chicken.  It really added to the texture of the dish and made it more enjoyable.

The lamb korma was the weakest of the 3 in my opinion.  It was a little more on the oily side than most kormas I've had in the past.  The xacutti was my favourite only because of the uniqueness of the dish.  I've never seen this dish on other menus at Indian restaurants. It's described as a coconut cream sauce.  You can taste the coconut, but there's also a lot of other flavours going on.  If you come here, definitely give this one a try.

Earth Indian will be on my list of places to go eat in for the future.  I will update this review accordingly when I do."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for here
Everything was so good!
We got the dinner combo - pick 2 meats, 1 veggie, 2 samosas or pakoras, 1 naan, 1 rice
For the meat, we got the butter chicken and beef curry
Both were really good (loved the butter chicken!)
The samosas were good too
The naan was fresh and delicious and a great texture (I also added a second naan - garlic naan, which was awesome)
The delivery was also very quick and the food was hot and fresh
We'll definitely order from here again 
The combo is also a very good deal but I'd recommend to add another rice or naan"}
{"text":"$7 for lunch combo. At first I thought this would be a great deal, but you are not getting much for this price. It's mostly rice, there was 4 pieces of chicken in my butter chicken combo and the sauce was a bit underwhelming. Salad was 2 small pieces of tomato, 3 thin slices of cucumber and a few pieces of lettuce. It's okay for a snack but not for a meal. It took 20-25mins to prepare it and the container they used left my meal warm (drove 5 mins back to work) but not hot as it should be.. their packaging has the no spill factor but not the insulation factor. I'm still hungry, and I don't eat much."}
{"text":"This place is relatively close to me so I've been here twice in the last month and all I can say is that I wish I bought more discount vouchers! I think I've been ruined when it comes to eating garlic naan bread anywhere else; Earth Indian has is figured out.

This place filled up quickly on both nights I dined here. It looks like they enjoy a steady flow of customers, which makes me happy because I'd like to come back in warmer weather and try the outdoor patio.  hint: please don't close anytime soon!  

Most of what I ordered here was exceptionally good, and you can expect to leave with leftovers. I'm a bit mystified by the decorating/renovation job, but it didn't distract me from enjoying more naan bread.

Bathrooms are always clean and very brightly lit. Not sure if the light makes a bit difference but that was my first impression."}
{"text":"I already liked this place, but their recent hospitality just made me love them. During Toronto's must recent Armageddon all the electricity went out in the North York region an many other places. My husband and I were starving and couldn't cook anything being that we live in a condo and have an electric stove. We called Earth Indian and not only were they willing to deliver amongst the deadlocked traffic, but offered to have us come into the restaurant for dinner. We decided to go to the restaurant.

When we got there, we weren't the only ones there either! They were delivering and serving other people as well. They set up candles for us on the table and the owner was cooking our food in minimal light. The food turned out great and it was quite romantic! They were so concerned to make sure our meal was good as well. Right as we were paying, with the one batteried powered credit card machine, viola! The lights turned on. 

Definitely recommend this place for their food and homely service."}
{"text":"I'd definitely return here. 

I really like the location and the ambiance of this restaurant. The entrance is not directly at the streetfront, so it's easy to walk by this place without noticing it. The interior is is dimly lit, and the decor is lovely. They were playing some sort of cool fusion music as well, which added to the lovely evening. 

Indian restaurants in the fine dining category are few and far between. I feel like many restauranteurs attempt but often fail in the face of  mom and pop Indian restaurants, whose flavour combinations and traditional recipes deliver great food for minimal prices. I can count on one hand the Indian restaurants in the fine dining category: The Host, Kama, and Mt. Everest. Out of these three, Mt Everest was the only one I was pleased by, until now. 

The food served at Earth is rich and delicious. The flavours are authentic, and the freshness of the food is evident. The service at Earth Indian was excellent! So good in fact that my partner tipped way above the expected percent. The standard papad with chutney was served at the beginning. After this arrived our main course. We ordered the vegetable biryani, and the Paneer Makhani, upon the recommendation of the waiter. The naan and roti were yummry. There was lots of saffron in the biryani, which I appreciated. Definitely worth a visit :) Great for dates!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for this restaurant - That's the fun part of groupon. Brings you places you would never think to visit. 

The food took quite a while to be brought out, and the inside of the restaurant was a bit dingy, but the food was delicious and the service was pretty good. We started with chef's platter (this was before I was diagnosed with celiac), then my fiance had the butter chicken with naan bread and I had some rice with veggies. Good portions and we both left feeling full. We didn't have dessert mainly because nothing on the menu appealed to us - but dinner was good!"}
{"text":"We actually stumbled upon this place when the restaurant we were originally going to visit was booked - and I'm glad we did! We were unfortunately the only ones there, but I'm not sure why it wasn't more popular, since the service was great and the food was amazing. We got some samosas and naan to share, and then we tried a variety of different main dishes - tandoori meats, curries, etc. Everything was delicious. I'd definitely recommend this hidden gem for all of your Indian food cravings!"}
{"text":"The price of the food was good but everything tasted sweet like my chicken tiki mandala which isn't supposed to be sweet. Ordered from Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Being from the US I don't get here often, but the three times I've been have been fabulous.   I get on a plane every Monday and off every Friday...in between there is always Indian food and I must say this is one of the best places I've eaten in all of North America!    

Weekend buffet was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"Fancy looking interior, well decorated, good wait-staff, and decent food.  I used to go here regularly for lunch buffet on weekends but they're restricting the days that it's offered on, so i'm not sure i'll continue going.  Food has been consistently OK, i've never had a bad meal here, but also have never had a great one. Nan is fresh, butter chicken is good. Food is pricey if you're not ordering from the buffet."}
{"text":"3.5 star!

Not much else to add to Vivek's thorough review. I would gladly go back to this place if I lived closer. 

Food was very good. The daal maharani dish that Janna S and I ordered was pretty sucky though. Please give that one a pass, it was very bland. 

The malai kofta and the garlic naan were freaking out of control. So good. Wasn't too oily but nonetheless, I'd still get pretty fat if I was eating this on a regular basis. Food was also nicely presented.

I'm also surprised that this was done by Restaurant Makover. The decor was just OK, so it must have been awful before."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it took over 2 hours and order was totally wrong when arrived. Apparently it was the drivers first night. Rightfully so, they refunded our 'not order'. Food was good though, even though I don't know what it was. Chicken korma and samosas I think."}
{"text":"A little hard to find as it's situated on the Northeast corner of Yonge and Cummer. However, I stumbled upon it when I was in the area and it's a really nice place. Service was great. The real kicker was that the ambiance is awesome. The food was awesome too (mind you I'm not an Indian food connoisseur). I had the palak paneer when I was there and it was super rich with flavour."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet Specials ($10.99) at Earth Indian is quite decent. 

We were first to arrive at 11:30 AM and we were hungry. The food at the buffet were fresh and hot... and we have the whole buffet to ourselves until the office crowd arrive at lunch! 

Tandoori Chicken was quite flavoured and moist.. the best item at the hot table. Curry Goat was tender but lack any spice..so was the Butter Chicken which has a really weak and watery sauce.

Naan tasted a little dry and burned lacking the fluffiness which I usually enjoy!

The hot sauce though is quite spicy... if you prefer a little kick to these non spicy curry dishes.

I think I will give Earth Indian a pass unless I am with friends that prefers less spicy food.. but if you do order a la carte, the spices level for sure can be adjusted to your preferences!"}
{"text":"The bhel and chaat were awesome. Nice to see these on a local menu. I asked for a chicken methi (fenugreek) curry and it was tasty! The staff cooked the meal quick as we had to take-out - but it was really quite good. Better than the average Indian restaurant and with a varied menu. Naan was great. Seafood on the menu and will try next time for sure. 
Good crowd inside shows it's popular amongst the locals. The korma was creamy and better than others I have tried - it's usually not a favourite dish. The lamb kebabs were unreal! 

We will be back :)"}
{"text":"We can here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. This place looks run down, but that's not even the issue here. Service was sloppy with only one girl managing everything (which is typical for a same struggling restaurant). 1 point off for service, 3 points off for food - food is awful, this is the worst Indian food I have ever had!!! Vegetarian food is disgusting- paneer makhani ( veggie version of butter chicken) was basically Campbell tomato soup with paneer dipping in it. Dal makhani was so watered down that the taste was missing. Paneer pakora was dry and looked like a kid made it. 

My Indian food is better tasting than this restaurant and I'm not even good at cooking! Needless to say, never returning again and wasting $60 for dinner."}
{"text":"Even though it took me close to an hour to get there, and I felt like I had ended up in a different country (there was even snow on the ground WTF), it was worth the grueling trek for Earth Indian. (My idea of grueling: take the TTC to Finch station; it's a ten minute walk North on the East side of Yonge.)

I was crazy late. My two dates, the lovely Lauren M and Janna S, were kind enough to wait, and we ordered almost as soon as I sat down. In short order we got malai kofta, daal maharani, lamb vindaloo, hara chicken tikka, and exactly three orders of garlic naan. The food was great: not too oily or heavy. The garlic naan was super-garlicky (a plus IMO) and the cylindrical malai kofta was creamy and flavourful. I wish the vindaloo was spicier but that is easily remedied.The hara chicken tikka (literally, green chicken) was the standout. Good spice level with in a hint of lime tartness. Portion sizes defeated us, and there was enough to take home.

Apparently this is another (victim of) Restaurant Makeover, but I can't say I thought too much of the decor. It appeared to be an Indian restaurant. Also, for some reason our server seemed positively afraid of us, but she was attentive and our water glasses never dipped below halfway. I would recommend this place, especially if you have a Metropass and enjoy subterranean transport.

Obligatory Title Pun: I would travel to the ends of the EARTH.

Menu Readability: Divided by type of meat/vegetable. Reasonable typeface.

Need to mention: They have a spacious patio out front.

What this place teaches me about myself: Have I never eaten Indian food outside."}
{"text":"Stay away! The delivery took two hours and when it arrived it was terrible. We called an hour into the order being placed, they told us it would take another 30 mins. 45 mins later they told it was going to be another 30 mins. Finally in the end, the food was terrible.  We called and spoke to the manager, he was extremely unapologetic and refused to rectify the matter. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"One word: FLAWLESS.
Backstory: My sister & I were starving on a Saturday evening and decided to try some Indian food nearby. However, we thought Finch/Yonge is primarily popular for Asian food and oh we were proven SO wrong! We searched this place up on Google and decided to give it a try, fairly impressed with the 4.5 overall rating it carried. 

Walk in, and you see a medium-sized restaurant nicely maintained and kept up with today's standards. The cashier's/waitresses welcomed us and took us to our table. Promptly took our orders later and the service was a 10/10 overall. 

Come to the food: It took them less than 20 minutes to prepare two items on our order and that created some suspicion as to would it be fresh, and we were proven SO wrong, yet again. Authentic Indian food in its truest form, I don't remember eating anything CLOSE to this since I last was in India! 

I highly recommend trying this place only for their food, if not for anything else. 

They kind of effed up on the payment by charging us another customer's bill, but that's okay as the store manager actively provided a refund with a receipt & charged the correct amount right after. 

Overall ratings:
Service: 10/10
Food: 10/10
Ambience: 10/10

Thus, the 5/5!"}
