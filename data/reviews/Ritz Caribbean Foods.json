{"text":"Came here on a weekend with friends and ordered the $5.99 lunch specials - we each ended up having one piece of each type of chicken (jerk, fried, and barbecue), with rice and beans, and coleslaw.  Rice was bland - there was only a small ladle of gravy, enough to cover maybe 1/3 of the rice.   The chicken was all pretty dry.  The jerk chicken was plenty spicy, but the spice seemed to overwhelm some of the other flavours.  Barbecue was really mediocre - bone-dry, chewy meat, with a passable (but dry!) sauce.  The fried chicken was the best of the three - crispy outside and flavourful , but unfortunately just as dry as the jerk. Service was quick, and the restaurant was clean.   That said, next time I crave Caribbean, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The prices went up up for the lunch specials but still a ok deal.    I go there once a week.   They have jerk,  fried and Bbq.      The jerk ia the best.   But they have a daily special that changes every day.  And yiu should try the honey bbq chicken.  It a bigger size than the regular lunch special."}
{"text":"For a basic white girl, I found the jerk chicken spicy AF.  Next time I will consider the bbq chicken instead as well as the reviews saying the food as mild - they were not written for me or by me. Still good tho"}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing this place since I moved from California to Toronto.  I needed goat curry in the worst way, but this place looked kinda sketch from the outside. I ended up going in one evening after work and ordering the goat curry, rice and peas and salad (or you can choose cole slaw) for ~$8. It was soooo tasty -- oh my.  And it was a giant portion.  Took me two sessions to finish it. Loads of meat, hardly any bone.  People, this rarely happens when you order a goat dish.  Since then I have tried the fried snapper, callaloo, potato salad and fried plantains -- all amazing. I couldn't possibly be more happy about this. Oh yummy. As a bonus, the women who work at the counter are extremely nice and will help you out if you have questions -- just ask. Its not a place you would go for a romantic date (or maybe you would -- hehe), but if you want exceptional food for a very reasonable price you need not hesitate to check out Ritz.  I'm slowly but surely learning that the best restaurants in College Park are the ones that look a little run down -- they've stood the test of time for a reason."}
{"text":"Came here for a cheap Friday lunch, place was rather busy and even though we ordered ahead our food was not ready and they didn't bother making it till we asked. The jerk chicken is chopped into small pieces, which doesn't look as nice as other jerk chicken places and was drier.   There was little coleslaw, and as it was thrown on top of hot chicken it was partially warm, not the most pleasing thing. Overall, considering it is pricier than Rasta Pasta, the quality of food is not there.  Last point, it was terribly loud inside, with a single harsh speaker blasting music while I was standing in line."}
{"text":"Haha my god I love the oxtail here more than any jamaican place I ever went to. I want more of this food than ever right now. They gave a little too much rice tho."}
{"text":"I got the small oxtail dinner yesterday and loved it!! So flavourful and tender! Nom nom. I like their jerk chicken as well."}
{"text":"nothing really needs to be said. this place trumps EVERY OTHER CARIBBEAN FOOD!!! so happy they are back open. even without the new renovations i still loved the place.  ** one thing i would say, some of the girls serving the food have sour attitudes."}
{"text":"Went in today and ordered lunch with a few co workers. The food tasted fine, but after we were done eating, we were disgusted when we saw the person handling our food picking his nose in the back. As if that wasn't bad enough, when we got back to the office we started feeling a little bit of a rumble down under.  Other than the eww factor of what we saw, there are so many better caribbean restos in Toronto. Cheap though!!"}
{"text":"this is going to be one of my go to places for lunch. best value for lunch special! very tasty , generous serving, place is clean.  I went back in the evening to buy more ( jerk, bbq and fried chicken are great) servers and cashiers are not as friendly i thought.. overall great food!! definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Tried the jerk chicken and BBQ chicken on a couple occasions. You can walk in and out with a $6 lunch in about 3 minutes so set your expectations accordingly. BBQ is on the sweeter side and jerk chicken is on the hot hot side. I found the BBQ to be more moist. Be careful of small fragments of bones."}
{"text":"There's not really a big market for caribbean food back where i'm from (Melbourne, Australia) and I was advised while in Toronto to be careful of dodgy Jamaican joints. I decided to try this place for my first taste of Jerk Chicken because it looked pretty busy - and it was sooo delicious!  The lunch special for 4.99 is filling enough for me (filling meaning I go lie down lol). Try the bbq chicken, I like it better than the jerk - absolutely must have it with their coleslaw :)"}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh. My favourite dish is the curry shrimp. Had everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Great Caribbean food spot."}
{"text":"Ritz on 211 Yonge St. is one of the best place for Jerk Chicken and fresh coleslaw in Toronto. The portion is generous for the price. I have been going there for several years and flavour is still the same.  I have tried the other 3 location in downtown Toronto, but none is better then this one. Customers service is not great and they have a high turn over of staff. I would recommend it if you want try Caribbean food."}
{"text":"I was buying dinner (take out) at this Ritz on Friday May 23 at around 5:00. A women in her forties or fifties was serving me. Before she served me she was changing the garbage right in front of me. I was waiting for her to wash hands before she serves my food which she didn't. Not only did NOT WASH HER HANDS, SHE ALSO PUT HER THUMB INTO THE CONTAINER THAT WAS MENT FOR MY FOOD. The price she charged me seemed high, so I asked her did the price of \"oxtail\" go up. She replied with attitude saying that the price did not change for a long time and mumbled \"STUPID\" which was directed to me.   What a horrable experience!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but didn't deliver everything I ordered, parts of my order was missing. It was a simple order with 2 meals"}
{"text":"Got a large jerk chicken. Not a lot of chicken and yet they charge u 11+ dollars. The chicken is dried and probably were previously frozen. The flavour is ok but u can find better ones in downtown.The service is alright thought not a clean environment. Oh well its yonge street. Won't return again."}
{"text":"I went for dinner by myself tonight and it was good. The oxtail dinner was delicious with the rice and peas and cole slaw. Being from the islands I can appreciate good Caribbean food. Will be looking to try their lunch special for sure. The dancehall music was live still."}
{"text":"I love this place! I been going to Ritz Caribbean foods now for 10 years. Good food, good vibes and good customer services."}
{"text":"They have the $4.99 lunch special, where they give you rice, chicken and coleslaw or salad. It is all packed into a styrofoam, square box. It was good, but the coleslaw was too sweet, like candy. The jerk chicken was tasty but very mild, to appeal to the masses. Rice was good, very moist. Filling, and indulgent, because it is sweet and fatty. But hey, for a little above 5 bucks, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken...best coleslaw...combine the two...best meal ever!   I come here every week for their special during lunch and it's only 5.99.  Try finding a good meal in downtown Toronto for that price...good luck.  I should try something else on their menu but I'm in love with the jerk chicken sigh."}
{"text":"Huge portions and great service! 4 stars if you're only dining in due to the dated decor, but this restaurant is the best for when you need a meal on the go. If you aren't eating 3000 calories a day then the small should suffice. The large is huge, you have been warned.  PS: try the plantain"}
{"text":"I'm Jamaican and used to my family's home cooking. I have to say I love the food here!  The lunch special ($5) with jerk chicken, rice and peas and a choice of coleslaw or salad ( I choose the coleslaw) is delicious. The jerk chicken is seasoned perfectly, and is extremely moist.  I've tried on other occasions the roti with shrimp and chicken: the portion size is huge and i find it difficult to finish (which is a good thing!). The curried shrimp is flavorful as is the curried chicken.  I would also recommend trying the fried dumplings (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) and the fried plantain is crispy, sweet and delicious.   The staff is friendly, and give generous portions.  I can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd have some jerk chicken for lunch. I found the chicken here very dry, and no gravy over my rice - maybe they don't do it unless asked."}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced. However the customer service tends to be hit or miss and, as others have stated, the hygiene standards of the staff are questionable (eg. handling food without gloves).  I would give the food 4 stars and the service 1.5 if I could.  During my most recent (and most likely final) visit, I was basically kicked out for eating some of my food from the takeout box inside the restaurant. I figured I could have some of my large barbecue chicken there and eat the rest at home. Apparently not, because that is against store policy even though there was no signage and no other customers present, which was the case at the time. Rather than berating me about how I was jeopardizing her job and essentially telling me I had to leave, the employee could have offered me a plate since she was so worried about her manager \"catching\" me with a to go box.  I get that the boss is trying to save money on containers, but I would've needed a container regardless.    I was willing to deal with the poor service until this majorly unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Good deal for your money- especially the \"specials\" at lunch. Very noisy- so if you want to listen to your own music or relax go for take out."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is authentic and delicious, the portions are reasonable given the price.  I usually have take-out for dinner after work and it feel like having a home cooked meal.  I tried it for lunch and I struggled to finish it because the portions were too big, I had the jerk chicken lunch special.  The reason I deducted a star is because there was a couple of times where the chicken was not as spicy than usual.  But overall the quality and taste is really good!"}
{"text":"I've had the roti 3 times now from Ritz and it's been top notch each and every time.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu but it all looks really good and I've seen many folks getting the jerk chicken so that must be one of their biggest sellers.  I got a chicken roti and added chana and collard greens, this was probably the best roti I have ever had (if not then it was top 3 all time!).  It was massive and could easily have been split or eaten in 2 sittings.  At $9 including taxes which comes with a side of either coleslaw or salad (it's gottsta be the 'slaw IMO) it's the sale of the century!  I am surprised to hear negative reviews about the service at Ritz, as I've always found the girls there to be very friendly, and they seem to enjoy their work, which always makes for a good vibe.  I just wish I worked near the Ritz so I could snag that lunch special!!"}
{"text":"First time eating jerk chicken and if this is the standard then I'm hooked!! It's amazing...you have to get in here and try the jerk chicken and coleslaw..a perfect combo of sweet and spicy. This place is a 10 in my book!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from South Florida...I stopped in to grab a few chicken patties, however I was given a beef patty (I don't eat red meat). I went back to Ritz Caribbean Food to exchange the beef for chicken. The manager insisted that the patties were chicken. I showed that the patties contents were beef. I asked for a refund. The manager then said that they do not give refunds however offered me a chicken drumstick...REALLY.  I declined the piece of chicken and told them to keep the money.  Needless to say, Ritz Caribbean Food will not receive a visit from me again. I was not happy about getting a beef patty or the customer service/resolution to their mistake."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY PLACE.  Jerk chicken is meant to be flavorful and a touch spicy.. although could use a bit bit more spicy, the staff are friendly and the food is delicious, I eat here once a week at least."}
{"text":"Ritz has some good Jamaica food. Some good classics and the people that work there are nice and alwaya have smiles on there faces"}
{"text":"Food is decent but their cheapskate portions and obnoxious staff are enough reason to never return."}
{"text":"The main thing I used to order when I worked nearby and ordered regularly was the lunch special.  A very strictly enforced special, in terms of the times they will sell it to you (I think it ends promptly at either two or three, no bargaining).  Anyway, you get jerk chicken, salad and rice.  A pretty hearty meal for under five bucks!  This place has the popularity of a fast food joint but I feel like they aren't necessarily running a production line that allows for that sort of service.  I know I have gone with my old coworkers in a rush to get back to work only to find the service unbearably so.  But mostly that's because the lunch special is pretty popular there, I think.  I have also had the roti there a couple of times and while it's not really close to my favorite roti in town, it's decent and probably better than anything you're going to get to eat in that particular part of town, which is very heavy on fast food chains and light on real satisfying food."}
{"text":"love their jerk chicken. Very moist and falling off the bones. I kinda like it more than the dry roasted syle jerk chicken served at most other places. They give you plenty of rice and salad too.  The large jerk chicken was plenty for two of us.  And their habanero pepper hot sauce was amazing!!! it goes sooo well with jerk chicken.  The only downside is the place is kinda small and not a fan of loud caribbean music. I would just do takeout."}
{"text":"I have tried the Ritz Caribbean near Yonge Station so I was glad to see they expanded north into the city. I went with two friends for dinner.  The food was adequate as far as Jamaican chain food can be but the service at the cashier ruined my dinner. I spent nearly 10 minutes with the cashier because I received wrong change. Normally, this would be a story of a dispute anywhere else because the cashier did not give back the proper change but here the cashier genuinely could not do simple addition and subtraction.  I was charged $6.10 so I gave her a dime and a 10 dollar note, which simply means I expected to see 4 dollars in change. Instead, I was asked to give another 80 cents! After I corrected her and said that was wrong, she then gave me back 80 cents!  I have no desire to return to act as a maths teacher."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good at all. I mean, I ate it because I was hungry but I didn't finish the white rice.. It was gross. My sister and I got there and they thought they had food but the didn't, so we had to change our orders completely. As we were ordering & waiting, a woman in the kitchen was scaling fish over the garbage. Now, every Caribbean person knows we either scale the fish over the sink with a bag or the garbage with an empty bag.. Anywho, she dropped the fish in the garbage and her face said it all. She called over another woman who was working in the back with her to come and pretend that she was searching for something by her. When she realized I could still see she \"quietly\" asked her coworker to shift her body so I couldn't see her pulling the fish out of the garbage. The thing is, I saw EVERYTHING. They couldn't fool me. The only thing good about this food stop was the ice cream I got. Their curry chicken just needed a little salt.. Curry should never have to be salted by the eater once it's cooked but I get it, cater to everyone. It's missing the authenticity of the Caribbean. Again, their ice cream was the best thing. Coconut ice cream, grapenut, and rum & raisin was SO GOOD."}
{"text":"This franchise location has now been taken over by their head office. Everything is either too salty or too sweet now. Very disappointing. Our whole office has stopped going since they took over."}
{"text":"First time I ever went into a Ritz.  I've never gone before bc of neg. Yelp reviews.  But i am happy to report that such neg reviews are completely unfounded.  While they may have been true once, none of what I have heard, occurred today.  I went for the jerk lunch.  He took a leg and thigh, perfect, I love the dark meat and then he put in another leg.  The female server then put in a super generous serving of coleslaw.  The food was very good.  I have been to Jamaica and I have to say the jerk here was a bit milder, but since a lot of white folk, not used to heavy spice, probably come in here, I would say the flavor was decent.  Spicy, not too spicy but also not too mild.  Rice 'n 'peas, good.  The slaw,was on the sweet side.  I am absolutely sure that there was sugar in it.  I personally prefer a vinegary, tart slaw as opposed to a creamy one.  Although the portion seems small, it was very filling and I was full enough before I finished.  I saw a man at the serving table as I was leaving and I approached him and said, \"you cooked the jerk chicken, didn't you?\"  He admitted to it and I complimented him on a fine job.  Everyone there was friendly.  Could be, that I went in smiling and smiled at everyone there and left a tip.  These small things make me and other people happy.  So simple, just a smile, doesn't cost anything."}
{"text":"Ritz is that one place that despite the bad service I keep going back b/c when the craving calls, no other rice and chicken combo from another restaurant can serve as a substitute. I always get either the rice and peas wih jerk chicken or with curried chicken, which come with a side of coleslaw (yum!) or fried plantains. In my opinion, it should come with both b/c the portion for either is tiny and seemingly getting smaller everytime I go. Not much can be said other than the obvious, their food is on point. There's a wide array of sauces and meats to choose from so I'm sure something to please all palate except the average vegetarian. The service on the other hand, pffffffffffff!!! The attitude of the staff is beyond stank. Sometimes they flat out act like you should pay for them to greet you. I don't want to blast every employee as I'm sure there are 1 or 2 that uphold a greater standard of customer service but I'd be willing to put money on the fact that 3 of 5 times, you will bear witness to a level of customer service well below average. What im trying to say is i LOVE the food but if only it could be self-serve.... Mainly for this reason, I give Ritz a meager score of 3 stars. Step up your game...your food being that delicious should not fool you into believing it is okay to treat your customers like they're intruders."}
{"text":"Another review for Ritz's lunch special of jerk chicken, rice and salad/coleslaw. For under $5, the portion and quality was fantastic.   The small storefront makes it far more conducive to simply ordering take-out. However there were enough available seats during the lunch hour for those more inclined to dine in.    I'm not a frequent Caribbean food connoisseur but the chicken was delicious and like a previous reviewer mentioned, the coleslaw was a pleasant surprise.   A great choice for a quick lunch-on-the-go!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Rotis, both bland and flavourless. The goat roti was mostly chucks on bone. Very disappointed overall. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is there ain't nothing better than a real Jamaican piece of fried chicken, oh and don't forget to throw some scotch bonnet sauce on that joint."}
{"text":"I went there because I wanted ACTUAL food and this was the ONLY place! So glad I found this place! I really think they should have a ORDER HERE! sign because I was confused at first where to go. Don't get me wrong, they ended up telling me where to go but it felt like I was being rushed to order. I ordered a small jerk chicken dinner and 1/4 fried chicken. Jerk chicken was almost on point (usually jerk chicken is spicy) the fried chicken looked appealing but the taste... no so much :( it was pretty dry :( Before I got to try anything, they accidentally dropped my food and I loved how they immediately fixed me a new one no ifs and/or buts! I'll definitely go back for their jerk chicken dinner but not the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place. Jerk chicken just falls off the bone. Roti is awesome too, very good portion.  Don't like sitting there but staff is very cool and friendly. I usually go here once a week."}
{"text":"We don't have Caribbean food often. Maybe for me it was even first time at Ritz on Yonge and College. Don't be afraid when you are a vegetarian to step in, as the busy kitchen women have lots of goodies and sides to offer you as well. We got the styro-box full of good home-cooked meal and you know that this is authentic. White rice came with red beans, on the side we had chickpeas, cooked spinach and cooked vegetables. It all came with a fresh creamy salad. We shared the box on a busy afternoon, when the place was quite busy, as people were eating their lunches in and taking them out.   Food was good, but nothing heavenly. It is good to try if you haven't, but if you are looking for a nice dinner with your partner, then this is not the place for it, as it is mostly lunch joint. Oh, the ladies were not the friendliest  and not very flexible, as we were looking for a substitution for meat..."}
{"text":"Every time my boyfriend and I are around the area, we somehow find ourselves at Ritz Caribbean. The raggae music, the jerk chicken, the vibe of the island.. OMG it's sooooo goood!!  The spice is not just hot but the flavour runs through your sinuses!   I find that their price is very reasonable.  A pound of jerk chicken to-go is only around 10 bucks!  We'd sometimes eat-in AND take out, too.  Get the boys to serve you. They're more generous with their portion size hehe.  Also, the jerk chicken is quite spicy.  Make sure that you're up for it!   (this restaurant does have TV but it doesn't really \"work\")"}
{"text":"I have been to all the locations downtown but primarily frequent the one across the Eaton's Centre. The food is great( I usually get the bbq chicken, soup or roti). The lady usually serving the food has a horrible attitude though. I don't do bad customer service I don't care how amazing your product/food is."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food but I find it's usually a little expensive for what you get.   Ritz was the perfect answer, you could get a small lunch special (7 days a week from like 11am-3pm) for $4.99; you would get some rice and peas with fried chicken or BBQ chicken or jerk chicken with some coleslaw or some plantain.   I have been to this location at least 10 times and I really enjoy the flavour of the food.    That being said, the last time I went I did not feel well, I thought it might be from something else but the same thing happened to a work colleague who I had introduced to Ritz also.    Needless to say, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Very tasty and authentic. The restaurant also plays amazing music :)"}
{"text":"My rating is only for the food. Atmosphere gets zero stars.  The chicken is absolutely awesome here. So tender and tasty it falls right off the bone. It also has a really nice and spicy flavor. The potatoes are nicely spiced and coleslaw is really good as well . Once I asked for potatoes instead of rice and they charged me $4.00 extra. Next time I'll ask about the price difference. Was well worth it though.   The customer service is okay. Not bad, not really good. Hard to explain.   For some reason on the weekends they let homeless people beg patrons for money while they're waiting to order, or sitting at a table eating. Staff just walks right by and does absolutely nothing to deter them from bothering you. I do have compassion for the homeless and mentally challenged, but I don't enjoy people coming up to me while I'm waiting to order and/or eating my food and asking me for money.  My last visit there, as soon as I walked in the door a very large woman came right up to me with a bag in her hand and was aggressively asking me to put money in it. She was right in my face and telling me that I had to give her money.I just turned around and walked out, and sadly I won't be going back. I don't mind buying a homeless person a bite every now and then, or helping them out financially when I can, but I can't afford to give every homeless person in the city money and/or food every time I want to eat out or get some take out.  I will be going to Rasta Pasta for my Jerk Chicken fix from now on."}
{"text":"Just discovered that Ritz has opened a location on Yonge just south of Bloor.   Went in today and it was PACKED. I ordered a Roti with a side scoop of Chana which I could barely eat half of. So delicious! The 4 stars is due to the lunch special $4.99 gets you rice, salad (or coleslaw) and chicken. (Or Chana I assume..)  Try their hot sauce, its great.  Regardless of the line, it came fast. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I found the employees to be very disrespectful every time I went in. First time the two young men were talking and laughing about patrons in the restaurant. The second time the woman was very curt and not at all pleasant. The food is good, but I would never go back because of the awful customer service"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the reviews from earlier patrons; I'm glad I did. I had a small jerk chicken with rice and slaw with a beef patty to top it off.  The chicken was delicious with just the right amount of kick for a typical Canadian. For a $9 lunch, it was extra appetizing.  I drove down from Northern Ontario where food diversity is considered Chinese food. So when I get a chance to visit southern Ontario, I make it a mission to try a wide variety of different foods. I'm truly glad I tried Ritz."}
{"text":"Extraordinary restaurant. Had lunch there today. I really enjoyed bbq chicken with peas and rice. Tasted wonderful, the chicken was tender, sauce was not too sweet and the coleslaw was excellent. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The service is prompt and the establishment is clean and well decorated. 5/5."}
{"text":"Not as good as the ratings it gets. Ordered chicken Roti: bland, watery. Roti was good. Hot sauce too much citrus"}
{"text":"Good location and food really tasty. Fresh cooked food. Love the roti, potatoes and plantain my favorites"}
{"text":"I love this place I've been coming here for years. Usually after work I'll pop in and grab either there Shrimp Roti which is amazing or their  fried chicken À la cart- Oh my goodness what a great flavor there crispy chicken has, I don't know how they do it -but it's to die for. There Jerk chicken is great as well.   A while back one of the servers behind the counter actually left me waiting while she chatted with her colleagues not even acknowledging me. Being a regular there I had never seen her before. I waited four minutes gave her eye contact and then I left.  I did call back the next day and spoke to the owner stated my case and he was very apologetic and said he had other complaints about the same server-he was very nice very understanding and his apology was enough for me. When I went back the following week the server was gone and I guess she was back in the kitchen because I did see her pop her head  out. Would  definitely recommend this place for great food and great customer service and I am still a happy regular customer with a smile."}
{"text":"When I went to Ryerson (just finished recently) for school I used to come here about once a week for lunch. The lunch deal was awesome, $3.99 for the jerk chicken (or BBQ chicken) with rice and peas and coleslaw (or salad) between 11am and 3pm.   I've been to several restaurants and takeouts for jerk chicken in Toronto - the next comparable one is the one at Gerrard Square. Anyway, even though I haven't been here in a while and as a Ryerson alumni now I still feel that this is the place with the best tasting jerk chicken at an awesome price. I know they opened a new location last year at Yonge and Shutter, the taste is not as good there. The one here at Yonge and College is the best. I have to come back here some day when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced. Better then alberts/ pats food.. but not as good for the oxtail. Location is good"}
{"text":"Mmm 4.99 jerk chicken, rice and slaw at lunch was as good as yelp reviews I read. I decided to stick around to eat it there to have as much scotch bonnet sauce as I wanted! Flavorful jerk sauce but it could be better. I'd come back to try more food for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not spectacular but price was great, staff were great and my hotel was across the street.  I'd likely eat there again if I was staying across the street."}
{"text":"Great food! Can't believe i haven't stepped into this place for so many years.  I walked by it all the time, and it looks a little ran down outside.  But once you've step in to try their offering, the food is amazing.  One of the best homey friend chicken i've tasted, fall off the bone jerk chicken and ox tail.  Its my go to place  for a good quick meal."}
{"text":"I ordered goat roti and that was my first time to eat goat roti. That was very delicious. It was big. It was $12, but it was enough for two people. I think Ritz has the best roti in the city."}
{"text":"I had been craving jerk chicken for a couple weeks now. I was out with my boyfriend and I had always seen Ritz and the crowd it gathers but tried it out tonight.  bought a jerk Chicken Lg with two waters for $13.00  The food was okay, yes it had the fall off the bone meat...but if that meat doesnt really taste like much it doesn't matter. The woman that served us had a thick accent...my boyfriend and I not being from the Caribbean had a hard time understanding.  We ate there. Music was good and the tables were fairly clean. Other customers that came in seemed to have a good relationship with the lady behind the counter. It seems like a place that keeps bringing people back I dont know I just feel like my quench for jerk chicken still isn't fulfilled."}
{"text":"Extremely rude lady at the counter serving, she stood there with her arms crossed grunting at us the entire time- this is the last time would go here. Bathrooms were disgusting and the rice was hard.  TIP: good customer service goes along way, improve your staff appearance and attitude and maybe hire some cleaning staff because your current staff are super lazy."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Ritz Caribbean  Cuisine: Caribbean Location: Downtown Address: 211 Yonge St Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 3  Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  *Food court style *Lunch special for $4.99 *2 in Downtown Area  Ritz is right across from the Eaton's centre and if you haven't eaten there, I am sure their colorful store sign caught your eyes once or twice. They specialize in Caribbean food and has super cheap lunch special, only $4.99 for lunch? I say that's a steal!!  To be honest, I am not too familar with Caribbean food since it's not very popular or easy to find in Vancouver. So I was super excited to see this place because I am always up for trying something new!  Once I stepped in, I was surprised to see the place so spacious. There were lots of seatings and if they wanted to, they could have squeezed in few more tables in.  I took my time checking out what they had behind the glass counter, and they had around 20 different types of food, varying from curry, jerk chicken, fried chicken to veggies.   They have very large menu with lunch and dinner specials. You can do dine in or take out.  I decided to go with the $4.99 lunch menu and got rice and jerk chicken. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken on top of the rice. Container looks small but it was actually quite filling.  Ordered: Jerk chicken & Rice 3/5  *Rice is filling and was quite spicy *2 pieces: 1 leg and 1 thigh *Chicken had lots of small bones which made it kind of hard to eat *Meat was falling off the bones *Can choose from coleslaw or gravy *Coleslaw was way too sweet *Perfect portion for lunch  Summary: For $4.99, I can't complain. Rice and Chicken was both decent. I am going back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Overpriced skilly.  The price is 30% higher than the regular fast food price. But the size is much more smaller then everywhere. Cheat with everything, size, quality, price. The place is just a fast food. Do not pay so much for this garbage."}
{"text":"Updated March 22 2017  I initially gave this Ritz a 5 star, but after our experience a few days ago, i have to downgrade.  The food is still great, but the service was horrendous. When we got there around 2pm, there was a short line, but the guy who was preparing the food seemed to be in some kind of hurry. While he is still packing the order for the person before (at times, even for the order 2 persons ahead), he tries to get your order. I thought he had a superhuman memory, but in fact, he got everything wrong. I ordered a curry chicken with fried dumpling and when he got around to actually filling my order, he put rice -- and i repeated that i wanted dumpling. He looked confused, but he fixes it.. then he goes ahead and puts curry goat! And i said.. uhm.. curry chicken. He looks confused again. Then he was about to put BOILED dumplings instead of fried and i had to correct him again.. and when i went to pay (which we had to wait about 10 minutes while my food is cooling on the counter, because they completely messed up the order of the woman in front of us -- NOTHING she ordered was prepared), i asked for my plantains (which it clearly says is included), and he said, oh it's not included, that's why i was confused when you ordered the dumplings. I told him that it's on the board, and he said it isn't. This goes on for a while -- anyway, in the end he gives it to me and charges me only the lunch special instead of the full price. My partner ordered the lunch special with jerk chicken, and they didn't even fill his order. We had to stand there waiting after we paid for them to fill the order (and i'd say 3 or 4 people have already ordered after him).   They seriously messed up almost everyone's order. A woman even left after ordering because she had waiting for her food for so long, saying she won't pay for this kind of service. I hope this is just an isolated incident since i really like the food... I will probably try again (the cravings are strong in this one), but if this happens again i won't go back.   ___ A long, long time ago, I stopped by to get the jerk chicken for lunch and it was pretty good -- nothing THAT special, so I never craved for anything from here.   On a cold night just a few days ago, however, my partner decided to go there to grab some food to go and I checked their menu and saw that they have curry goat and oxtail, so we got those with rice for one and boiled dumplings with the other. They were SO good. My favourite was definitely the curry goat, it was slightly spicy, the meat was tender and falling off the bones, and the sauce was rich and creamy. Perfect for a cold day! The oxtail was also really good. I'd only had fried dumplings before so I had no idea what the boiled one would taste like. The texture was strange to me at first (since when I think dumplings, i think chinese dumplings), but it grew on me quickly. It's very dense and sticky. Almost like a harder, more compact mochi (with no filling)? Either way, i seriously almost went back the very next day to get some more!"}
{"text":"This place makes really good food!   I usually get the BBQ chicken lunch special for $5.99. It used to be $4.99, but it's still a good deal for what you get.  The container it comes in looks small but they stuff it pretty well and it's actually a heaping plateful.    Add a large fountain pop for $1 (I think this is a summer special) and you have yourself a very satisfying meal.    This is my Friday lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Damn, I ordered a stewed chicken dinner with a piece of fried chicken and couldn't finish it in 1 shot.  It cost me $11 and it was enough food for 2 meals!  The fried chicken was nice and much more than I had expected.  Awesome crispy skin and still moist on the inside.  Awesome right?  I had to wait a bit for the stewed chicken so I got it fresh out of the kitchen.  The stewed chicken was tasty and it really hit the spot and definitely much more than I expected.  I ordered a small and if that's a small...really, I don't want to try to finish a large!  All your food is packaged in a styrofoam container so you can take it to go or eat it there.  The dining area reminds me of a greasy spoon diner.  It's not spectacular but that's the vibe it gives off.  I didn't try the jerk chicken or oxtail here but from the ratings the jerk doesn't interest me.  The oxtail is a different story though.  I'll be back to stuff my face!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!  The food selection is always delicious here whether you're trying to Jerk Chicken or the Oxtail.  Being Jamaican myself, many places have gotten it wrong, but Ritz is not one of them.   Definitely come here for the great food, however they are not really big on decor and ambience. Great spot if you're with someone else and you want a tasty, but quick bit to eat."}
{"text":"A good spot to cure a craving for some Jerk Chicken! I always opt for the lunch special ($5.99), which is an affordable offering of either fried, BBQ, or Jerk Chicken, served on rice and peas with salad/coleslaw. All of which I have tasted and can verify that they are tasty and will fill one up until the next meal. I find that this particular location seems to always be more generous with their portions and are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Ritz is always great if you're in the core looking for some Jamaican food. It's not authentic style, Jamaican food , it's more fast food tasting. None the less, it's better than the sunrise chain. Their oxtail is great, the bbq and jerk chicken are most and drop off the bone great. Rice is cooked almost perfect. Just a good place to get some west Indian food. Recommended."}
{"text":"Oxtail was just ok.  Wasn't tender enough; but was still cooked.  The jerk chicken was ok.  The bbq chicken was just ok;  it was like bbq chicken with some extra bbq sauce poured over it at the end.  Food was nothing to write home about.  Didn't really feel the love.  Would not visit again. I am picky. On the same level as other fast food joints."}
{"text":"Ya this place is pretty great and pretty good price. My only problem is the side salad they serve with their meals, mostly iceberg lettuce with a slice of tomato. Overall its worth trying."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Caribbean flavor, this place is a great spot to grab a bite.  This place is authentic with its flavorful and moist jerk chicken alongside of upbeat reggae tunes that I remember from my youth (Growing up in east Scarlem).  I like the loud music.  I feel it's part of the fun.  Prices are alright. The food isn't that spicy. But it tastes good.  Today, I opted for chicken roti with a fried dumpling and plantains for just over $10.  The roti comes in a small box, but it's really filling. Layered and airy roti stuffed with curry chicken and potatoes. The dumpling was alright. Nothing amazing, I just wanted something fried and able to sop up some of the curry.  Anyways, in the area it;s one of the only places that serves decent Caribbean food.   Also, their lunch specials are super cheap.    Sunrise is nearby as well, but I really wasn't impressed and told myself never to go back."}
{"text":"I have a similar story as everyone else where I stumbled upon this place not expecting much. However seeing the long line around lunchtime gave me hope that the food was going to be good. This is definitely what I would call a hole-in-the-wall kind of place where there's no fancy decor or nice silverware - it's just delicious hearty homestyle foods.  I got the BBQ Chicken lunch special while my boyfriend got the Jerk Chicken lunch special. Both were amazingly flavorful and delicious but I definitely preferred the BBQ chicken, especially with the extra scoop of BBQ sauce on top.  The chicken was super tender and loaded with BBQ goodness, the rice was perfectly cooked (although I'm personally not a fan of beans in my rice) and the coleslaw was crunchy and surprisingly sweet.  At Ritz you definitely get bang for your buck. For only $6 you can get enough food to put you in a food coma.  PRO TIP: Consider downloading the Ritual app so you can place your order in advance and skip the long line. The app also offers occasional discounts."}
{"text":"It's three stars because not everything here is always consistent, but if you have a craving it will do. I think sometimes things sit in the hotpan for too long. If you're questioning, curry chicken or jerk chicken are reliable options. Ox tail and goat can be hit or miss. Finally got to try ackee and saltfish and don't know if this is what it's supposed to really taste like because I haven't had it anywhere else before. It reminds me of an anchovy and silken tofu stirfry in a spicy butter-like sauce. This is pretty interesting given that ackee is a fruit. For a small person like me that's 5'5, the small combo is guaranteed to get me full."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was moist and flavourful. It was a pleasant surprise to get such nice Caribbean food in the Yonge and Eglinton corridor. Would definitely return for more great food and service!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I came here on a friend's recommendation and I was NOT disappointed. Our party of 3 arrived at 11:55 assuming we'd beat the rush hour but there was already a line forming at that point. No worries though, the staff here are quick and get your order in and food out into your bellies.  I ordered the lunch JERK special with a patty on the side. And I was smiling the whole way through my meal. What a treat. The chicken was spicy, but not to the point where I couldn't feel my mouth. The rice and peas just absolute perfection. And finally the coleslaw, well balanced between dressing to coleslaw and also a great way to cool down your mouth if the chicken is too spicy for you! And if you're up to it! Get the patty! It literally melts in your mouth.  The only warning I have about this place is make sure you have a nice place to take a nap after. Serious food coma! :)"}
{"text":"The line was atrocious. Yes, it was lunch time, but they should have more people working during peak hours. We waited close to 25 minutes to get to the front and they just ran out of Jerk Chicken. It would be another 15 minutes for a new batch to be cooked up.  The food is good, but my suggestion is go there before peak hours to grab your meal.  For Ritz, hire a few more staff members for peak hours and have all the food ready for the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"Eaten here a number of times. Mostly have the jerk chicken, rice and peas. Always the same. Always good.  Consistency is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Plantain chips are my favourite thing ever! My coworker took me here for lunch last year and we got the jerk lunch special. Daaaaaang mamacita! So tender, so flavourful and so cheap! The lunch combo comes with a jerk chicken thigh and rice and a drink.... all for $5 (that's cheaper than a venti latte). I've been back a few more times and usually around lunchtime there is a line going outside. (But they get through it pretty quickly since most of the food is already cooked) There is seating but usually it's full of high school students around lunch time so I bring it back to the office or eat on the benches outside (in the summer)."}
{"text":"I just came back from my second visit here and everything was great, if not better than the first time. The jerk chicken was legit spicy, so good it almost made me eyes water and the coleslaw was nice and sweet to balance out the heat. I finished my jerk chicken lunch special completely satisfied."}
{"text":"When I am Downtown,Ritz is my fav lunch stop on a cold and/or rainy day. There is a constant flow of hungry traffic is this little spot of Caribbean sunshine in the heart of downtown TO.  I find the staff is always friendly and the place is very clean.  Personal fav is the chicken roti with slaw, which I smoother with scotch bonnet sauce when I get to my table. mmm mmm mmm."}
{"text":"I have always loved going to Ritz Caribbean Foods for Jerk Chicken for the last year.  If anyone is wondering it is not authentic. I remember in Jamaica going to Boston beach and up on the road with the zinc roof these men all doing Jerk pork. This was in the sixties and seventies and eighties, but onto the real reason for this review. So, the jerk at the Ritz is not bad. Ali's Roti shop is a thousand times better and more authentic, but hard for me to get too.  So, for the last year I have been going to Ritz and I have found the staff really not friendly and I find that odd because most people from the Islands are very warm and friendly. At this Ritz they are quite unfriendly, but in the last month the staff seems to have change over and so I can only assume new management and this staff is downright unfriendly even hostile. I have been going less and less.  I was in there yesterday, May 31, 2017 to buy Jerk Chicken and rice and peas. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could please get some Jerk sauce over my rice. Which she did. Then I turned to go to the front to pay and I saw her put the jerk chicken on the rice and then when to pour the Oxtail gravy over the rice and chicken. Before I could stop her, she had drenched it in Oxtail gravy. I said to her oh no. I hate Oxtail, is that Oxtail gravy? Could you please give me a different set up. As we all know gravy when poured gets into all the corners so it is not possible to get rid of the flavour. She changed the take-out container and put new rice, but put the chicken which she had poured Oxtail gravy. I explained to her that I wanted new stuff because I hate the taste of Oxtail really and truly and.... She cut me off. I would not let her explain because I knew what she was doing and I would have none of it. My bad. So, I allowed her to explain and she said that not all of oxtail sauce... she called it sauce had touched the chicken and she was giving me the pieces which had not been touched by the Oxtail gravy. I can tell you that was an out and out lie. I watched her pour the gravy over everything. I asked for a completely new take out order and she can you believe said that if I was not happy with what she was doing I could leave.  That is customer service for you. Will not be going back. That is for sure. I will make the trip to Ali's roti shop."}
{"text":"First time at Ritz and I got the lunch special $4.99 for small box.  Came with rice and Coleslaw.  Chicken was amazing same as the Coleslaw.  Wasn't a big fan of the rice with beans.  It did fill me up for lunch so it was good for what I paid. Will come back for the Ox Tail  next time."}
{"text":"Got the large jerk chicken dinner with rice and beans and salad.  everything was nicely seasoned but the oxtail gravy didn't help the moisten the rice and peas, not to mention it took on a rather sticky texture and consistency.  I also didn't care for the fact that the food was borderline cold and the salad was limp and uninspired.  Still, the jerk chicken was tasty.  Not sure if I would go back though."}
{"text":"Very salty didn't taste like the stew chicken I am use to and the rice tasted like boxed rice, my boyfriend had the jerk chicken and loved it I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Looks like new owners have taken over and it does not bode well for diners. Today I went there for lunch and when it should have been the busiest with a long queue of people, there were maybe 6 people on the premise. Also there used to be a daily Chef Special...no more. The $6 lunch special is still offered. I ordered my usual small curry chicken with rice/peas & coleslaw. The curry was underwhelming, portion was half the size of the old picture below & at the same price. Needless to say I was not full after my meal. Looks like I'll have to get my jerk on somewhere else. Also the new staff was not very accommodating compared to previous workers."}
{"text":"This place has raised their prices & decreased there portions, I ordered the small dinner Jerk Chicken, container was half full extremely disappointing,  especially since it cost me $9.00.   I have been there a few times always received goods portions & there Jerk is decent.   Also they added too much pepper to the Chicken.  Noticed as well the line up was really short, now I can see why."}
{"text":"That $5 lunch special can't be beat if you're a ryerson student. That barbecue chicken and cloeslaw......blessed"}
{"text":"This was horrible. Went here today. Rice and peas was stale and dry at lunchtime. Curry was borderline inedible and the counter staff was rude to ME because THEY didn't carry hot sauce. Dude. This is a Jamaican restaurant and pepper sauce is 100% part of the cuisine. Especially to cover up the taste of this dry, bland meal. Never ever again."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The rice and peas are cooked to perfection. Jerk chicken is excellent and so is the oxtail. I work in the area so I am here very often. Great place and they are so friendly. I think it's the best food in the area!"}
{"text":"Is that Popcaan I hear? Yea it was Popcaan. If you dont know who that is...smh. The food was on point. I love jerk chicken. The rice was a little bland for my taste. But it was acceptable...they didnt have salt or pepper though which was weird? The chicken was mildly spicy.  I like my jerk chicken  grilled or bbq'd so i have a little char on it. Maybe this chicken was baked or smoked? The area the spot is in is really congested and no parking be aware!"}
{"text":"Classic Caribbean cuisine, went with my girlfriend and we ordered the curry goat and jerk chicken at the owners suggestion. He was really friendly and seemed genuinely delighted that we enjoyed his food and suggestions. The meal was delicious but perhaps just a tad salty. The goat curry was excellently flavoured and the meat was soft for goat. Jerk chicken was classic and delicious with some good kick. P.s. If you don't like spicy do not drink with ginger beer lol this is a two fold effect. But I love the spicy kick of sips on ginger beer in between, really great accent to the meal."}
{"text":"My coworkers introduced this place to me. I've never really had authentic Caribbean food before so I can't comment on that aspect, but omg the jerk chicken is delicious! I've had jerk chicken at various restaurants but they don't come as close as how good it is here! The joint is quite far from my work, otherwise I'd be eating this for lunch at least once a week. The service is usually below average but who cares"}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of Caribbean food. Great, flavorful jerk chicken, beef stew. Patties were soft and flaky. Nice spot for a quick meal. In and out in no time!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Caribbean and went to this place because it was close and the reviews look good. It does look good  I think I just chose the wrong dish. I'm a fan of the goat. So I expect some bone when I get - it's normal. But this was an incredibly abnormal amount of bone you can see the pic I'm only three quarters done. Pretty unhappy with the goat Roti but plantains were great. I'll return to try the chicken before I make a final call."}
{"text":"Ritz Caribbean is my favourite spot for quick sit down, or take away food. The roti's have so much flavour, and the jerk chicken dinner is always good too. Make sure you add their hot sauce if you like an extra spicy taste. Prices are fair for dinner, but super cheap at lunch."}
{"text":"Satisfied my craving for roti. I had goat with an extra side of caliloo to go with the coleslaw. Everything was good, staff was friendly, good portions for the price. I would recommend this spot. As an added bonus you get to listen to some forward roots/culture/lovers rock reggae while you eat. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunch specials you'll find in the city. \"Good bang for your buck\" comes to mind . Great deals. Good food. Fast service. You get your money's worth here without a doubt. There are a bunch of locations scattered across the city it's worth going atleast once for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch here and there and order a lunch special.  You can get either jerk chicken, bbq chicken or fried chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw for $4.99.  Not bad since they give a 1/4 chicken leg...they are all good.  Ask for some oxtail gravy on your rice to give it that extra dimension.  I always order a side of plantain ($1.25).  The texture and sweetness go very well with the savoury spice.  They aren't the friendliest staff...but they are fast and get the line moving."}
{"text":"I've had hit and miss experiences at Ritz and it was my first experience at this location. I love oxtail and this my default order but the portion size I got felt a little on the light side compared to other locations.   It didn't feel like great value for money compared to the lunch special for a lot less that I saw everyone else walking out with.   Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Every time I go the food is fresh and the staff is really  nice, courteous and professional . Great portion size for the special that  runs from 11- 3pm ( dont quote me on the timing)"}
{"text":"You know, I've been passing by this place for years,  looking in through the window all i could see was hot table west Indian food under heat lamps. It really didn't seem like a quality place. I broke down one day last week and decided to finally give it a try. I ordered a bit of the fried chicken and a bit of the  \"jerk chicken\"  Being west Indian, i have a fair bit of experience with this food and how it should be prepared. Simply put, this is mediocre west Indian fast food at best. Baked jerk chicken? guys c'mon, real jerk chicken is BBQ'd over allspice wood. Baking it, is pretty lazy, i mean anyone can do that... the chicken was way overcooked, greasy and just tasted blah, i could not finish it, it was kind of gross to be honest. The Fried chicken was a little better, but again, overcooked and very dry. it was fairly bland too. Their coleslaw was rather bizarre, it had the strangest flavoring that i believe was vanilla?!, i'm fairly sure thats what they used. that as well was rather gross too. If you've read this far, you've likely picked up on the \"Gross\" theme here. I think if you have never had west Indian food before, or your experience with this type of cuisine it is very limited or if you are really drunk or high or both, you may enjoy this food. But i can't say I've ever experienced such low quality boring west Indian food until coming here. It was really quite bad, i'm surprised this place has been around as long as it has. Save your money folks, this is place is not worth your hard earned money. The are many more, much better and less lazily made west indian food out there that is worth your money.  Spend it there, you've been warned."}
{"text":"I love this place! Extra points that it's right below my building For work making it the best grab at break food. There PlainTains and spice you patties are delicious and full of flavour. They have great lunch specials which satisfy the hunger and are a great bang for your buck:)"}
{"text":"The value for the food here is incredible. You get so much food for a reasonable price - $12 is probably enough for 2 meals for the average person.  I got the Jerk Chicken and Fried Chicken - no rice or salad. They really load up on the fried chicken, but the Jerk not so much. Nonetheless, it was still tasty and the fried chicken was probably one of the best I've ever had (better than KFC for sure!). The seating area is clean and modern (looks newly renovated) and the staff is helpful and polite. That in combination with good tasting food and excellent bang for your buck - I can't complain!  Overall I would recommend this to a friend and if you're in the area and want to try some Jerk Chicken, this would be a great choice."}
{"text":"I tried Ritz for lunch today for the first time. I had the roti, which was very tasty. Only complaint is it came in a container that was barely large enough for it, which made eating it a bit of a challenge. There are lots of choices on the menu; Ritz is a good place to add a little variety to your lunches. There is quite a large eating area for a fast-food type restaurant. You've probably walked by it a bunch of times... it's worth stepping in."}
{"text":"Good portions and the taste is well balanced. Meaning it's not over-spiced with pepper/hot sauce. It's busy,  which means the food is fresh. Service can seem slow as the patrons seem to come in waves.  One minute it's dead, the next minute the line is out the door. Only real draw back is the music. They blast it like they're in their own car. Often times patrons are yelling to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Ritz is a chain and I have been to their Yonge Street location plenty of times, so when they opened this location up closer to home, I had to try it out. My favourite is the jerk chicken,which has good flavour, not too much heat, and not too much of the cinnamon, allspice and clove flavours, which is how I like it. The fry chicken is pretty good too, and the goat roti has really nice flavour, but they put way too much potato  in it. The plantain needs to be cooked longer, too - it's still too firm. My real beef with this location is that they don't give you enough gravy on the rice and peas. Both times I even asked for extra gravy but there was barely any. The downtown location is better."}
{"text":"Really torn by this place.  The service is probably one of the worst I've experienced.  Very slow and disorganized - even when lines are short, it will take 3x the time it should.  They also make mistakes all the time with your order so you need to pay attention to what they're doing.  They have no napkins laid out - you have to ask for them and even then they act like you've asked for something unusual.  The service here probably deserves 1 star.  BUT, if you like jerk and curry goat and oxtail, this is probably the only place in the area to get it and the food tastes great.  I want to give this place 2-3 stars but that wouldn't feel right when I go there twice a week!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is always amazing. Their jerk and fried are my favorite. Their hot sauce, has a nice kick you it. You cannot go wrong getting lunch from here especially for what you pay. The value is amazing."}
{"text":"I always walk by this place when I get my haircut (shout out to Onyx Barbers) and never walked in. I love Caribbean food and decided to try it as I had some time before my appointment. This time I tried to their curry goat plate. I won't say it was terrible, it wasn't; but I also won't claim it was great. I've had better but for the price I paid, I was satisfied. I think the biggest selling point they have here is the price point, for which you truly get great value.   It's a small place with a few tables, not a place you go to with a large group but usually when you get jerk you wouldn't roll deep with a large reservation anyways. Grab your food, maybe a Ting and keep it moving as it's good for a quick, cheap bite; but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Like the below reviews point out, this place is only worth going to for the lunch special. The jerk chicken combo is delish and plenty of food for $6. The jerk chicken is so tender and juicy, it falls off the bone - just the way chicken should be cooked. The coleslaw is creamy and sweet, and the rice and peas are perfectly moistened by the gravy.   If you come here at lunch, you may find a long line up of construction workers, the office crowd, and locals but it usually doesn't get busy until 12:30. Come early to get a seat inside and enjoy your lunch break listening to some reggae tunes while you eat."}
{"text":"On my trip today I had the jerk chicken dinner. I ordered the small, which was plenty of food. For under $10, it filled up all 285 pounds of me :-) I enjoyed my rice and beans, but I do think that is hard dish to mess up. The only time I remember having rice and beans that I didn't like is when they were so gummy that it could have been used to spackle. The Jerk Chicken was super tender and well seasoned, but not spicy enough for me. They did have a few different varieties of hot sauce on the tables, go for the grace scotch bonnet its the most traditional flavor they had. If I were rating on my jerk chicken and rice and beans alone, I would have probably given closer to 3 stars. But there was one more component to my meal, the coleslaw. The coleslaw was amazing! I don't know what they do to make it as delicious as it is, but it should be illegal. Hello my name is Tim and I'm a coleslawaholic... the weird thing is is I'm not even usually a fan of coleslaw, but this stuff was great. If I were rating just off of the coleslaw, 5 stars. Hence the four star rating. I will be back, if for nothing else the coleslaw. Give it a shot, I am sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is usually good. I had the Jerk Chicken and it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great food if you get it hot and fresh! This time it was tasty but the chicken was barely warm but the rice was hot. The plantain was not ripe enough to be fried. Staff are friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Admittedly not the best looking food joint on the outside, but for a $4.99 lunch deal of bbq chicken, rice and coleslaw, it can't be beat. Don't let the tiny box fool you, there's actually a lot of food packed in there. I was satisfied with my meal and will return again. Had the jerk chicken before at a different location but I think I will stick to the bbq chicken when I'm feeling up for some Carribbean again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.  I've been coming here on and off for about 3 years now (I stared at it for the 2 years prior as I deemed it much too sketch to actually try).  But at lunch hours you get a healthy crowd of people looking for a great deal.  Your choice of chicken, with rice and side salad (leaf or coleslaw) for only 4.99! (used to be 3.99$ but price raised in 2011 to keep up with rent/competition).  The food is just the right portion for a full meal (right portion= You will be overeating by a little if you finish it).  I dont' know what it is about the coleslaw here but it's amazing.  I usually hate coleslaw but here I'll eat it and wish there was more. The rice is nice with some peas and red beans throughout and she'll douse it with delicious fatty stew gravy if you want. And the chicken is fall off the bone goodness.  All in all, you can't lose. This is probably the best location out of all of them in the chain."}
{"text":"I had the Jerk Chicken lunch special for $5.99 and it was pretty good, though the sauce was a bit spicy! I do admit that I have a very low spicy tolerance though so it probably isn't spicy at all to most people.  The chicken was tender, the coleslaw was decent, and the seasoned rice was good (not too oily but not too dry).  The portion size was average - they serve it to you in those standard square-shaped styrofoam boxes.  For its price, I would say I got my money's worth but I probably wouldn't come here too often. The food's alright but nothing spectacular. With so many great cuisines available downtown and some at even cheaper prices, I'd more likely \"try something new\" on a good day as opposed to come here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with someone who comes here often for lunch. I guess on the weekend they're not quite as busy because they were BLASTING reggae music making it a bit more difficult to place an order, not to mention dine in.   They had just put on a fresh batch of fried chicken so we opted for that as our protein, drizzled with ox sauce, rice with beans, and the coleslaw. For about $11.  The fried chicken was very juicy and flavourful. However, I'm not 100% sure how much of that moisture came from the frying oil. It's quite good, but very very greasy. The ox sauce definitely gave it a boost though and i might think about just ordering that as a dish next time. But back to the chicken, you get great portions, there were 5 or 6 big pieces that I knew I could never finish in one sitting.   The rice was fine, no complaints. But the coleslaw was differenttttt. I know a lot of people love it an I see the appeal too. But to me, it tastes like it was covered in sweet soy milk and mayo? And I love all these things but together with fried chicken? I'm not too sure. Something to be aware of, it's not your typical coleslaw!   Overall, not the best fried chicken I've ever had VERY good value. It has also intrigued me to return and try some of their other dishes to-go."}
{"text":"addicted. lunch special is a big portion of rice & beans, 2-3 pieces of chicken and a dose of refreshing salad for $5.00.tip; say yes to oxtail gravy. The festival bread here is hit and miss but if you have never tried it, try it. It is sweet so s good mini dessert.  will always go back."}
{"text":"Of all of the Ritz locations in Toronto the Yonge and Eglinton restaurant is absolutely the best. I've eaten at the one closest to the eaton centre and the Yorkville location on a few occasions and neither one is even close to as good as Yonge and Eglinton. Chicken is always fresh, delicious jerk marinade, fried chicken is also great, their soups are comforting and homemade different every day and the owner is very kind and charming."}
{"text":"This is what i'm talking about.  Good wholesome honest home cooked caribbean food.  I've searched far and wide in the gta looking for something close to my drumlin jerk in ochos rios.  While i'm still looking for that perfect jerk, ritz it's pretty fantastic!  Not only is the jerk awesome, the homemade fried chicken  dinner is delectable too.    Get your taste of jamaica here!"}
{"text":"Yummy char grilled Jerk. I live in the Washington, DC area and its difficult to find Jamaican food like this. Especially quality Jerk chicken without sauce. I loved it! Very good and inexpensive. Like everyone in Toronto, the staff was super nice and pleasant. The only issue is that there were no plantains that I saw available. That was a disappointment. There are too on Yonge street. One across from the Eaton Center and the further down the street past the AMC. We went to the location passed the AMC. I will definitely go back to Ritz when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Ritz is a fast food type of restaurant (and so are every other Caribbean restaurants I know). They have pre-made selections ready to scoop out into a container at your command. There are spaces for sitting and you can also get take out.   I had Jerk chicken once and also Ackee and Saltfish, both times with rice. I love their seasoning on their jerk chicken. It has a small kick but not overwhelming. You can't really tell what A&S is just from looking at it but it tastes just fine. It's my first time trying A&S. It's good but I find their ox tail and jerk chicken more savory.   My only real complaint is that they shouldn't chop up the chicken. It's fine to just serve me the whole piece of quarter chicken. The way they cut it, you might bite into bone shards. Also, I'm used to eating Persian rice or Korean rice. Persian rice is light and fluffy. Korean rice is round and a little sticky. I'm not too fond of the rice at Ritz but it may just be a personal preference. I find it a little dry.  Prices are alright. A large jerk chicken will cost you a little over $10. It comes with tons of rice and is about half a chicken. A small jerk chicken is quarter chicken.   I love to explore new cuisines. If you haven't tried Caribbean, I recommend Ritz as your starting point."}
{"text":"For $5, you get flavourful and good food! I haven't eaten in at the restaurant so I can't comment on it but their service for takeout is quick. Sometimes I pick up some jerk chicken for dinner before night class because it is so near Ryerson :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite jerk restaurant to eat in the city. The jerk chicken is very tender and flavourful with the bones easily falling off the meat. Their coleslaw salad is the best ever and accompanies very well with the meal. I've tried their fried chicken but not a fan as it was a bit dry and blend."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here back at my desk, supposed to being enjoying the goat roti that I ordered.  However it is not goat.  Its freaking chicken!!!  I'm half trini so I know the difference between the two meats.  I would go back but its a 10 min walk each way so I'm best off just writing up a review the passive-aggressive Canadian way.  Experience - the restaurant must be run by my university roomie because there is loud music blaring as soon as you walk in the door.  Almost every customer has to repeat their order 2-3x because the order taker cannot hear them over the music.  I ordered my goat roti, just like I did last week.  Last week's goat roti was good.  Better than Carribean Pot Luck's, but not as good as Mitzie's or my Grandmother's recipies.  Processing wise the roti ordertaker is not the food prepper. Just like last week I got all the way to the cashier who then had to turn and berate the guys to make my roti.    Considering I paid $13 for them to !@#$ up my order like a bunch of bumboclaats, I'm not going back for average roti."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Carribean food joints in Toronto!!  It's more a take-out food kind of place, I've dined in once and it's small and quaint but the food is spectacular!  I've had the Jerk Chicken, BBQ Chicken, Curry Chicken, Curry Goat - it's all good!  It's meat of the bone, filled with flavor good.  Mmmm thinking about it makes me want to go now!  Portion Tip:  They have a lunch special that is $3.99, for a small portion.  You get a slab of leg and about a bowl of rice with a side of coleslaw or salad.  The Salad is boring and kind of gross, but the coleslaw is good.  For dinner, I get the large and it's enough for 2 people, plus leftovers!!  Overall, it's great if you need lunch or dinner on the go.  The flavour is never compromised (when I've been anyways!)  One of the best I've been to in the city!"}
{"text":"With Bob Marley, Beres Hammond, Barrington Levy and the \"Cool Ruler\" Gregory Isaacs punctuating the airwaves, Ritz offers a laid back Caribbean vibe.  But don't let the mellow melodic music choices lull you into a false sense that these people are laid back when it comes to their food, as they are anything but.  The lunch special is an incredible deal, for $3.99 plus tax (before 3pm) you get jerk chicken, rice n' peas and creamy slaw.  The lunch special portion is not massive, but more than substantial for the price.  Ritz is simple consistent Caribbean food done well.  Great for short lunch breaks while working as the staff is diligent and effective in churning out orders."}
{"text":"I work around here and go here all the time for lunch.  The other day I noticed for the 2nd time now that they have cut back on the jerk chicken portions when you order the small or large.  The flavour is still there, but that's a deal-breaker for me.  I'm going else where for my Jamaican fare now."}
{"text":"This place is a little rough around the edges but the food quality and taste is top notch. Very authentic and home made tasting. The meat is tender and soft. Would be nice if they had more side options, currently they just have salad or coleslaw."}
{"text":"great food to sooth a hangover. The service is alright. There are known for their \"soul food\". But I wouldn't go as far to say its the best Jerk you'll find in the GTA."}
{"text":"When it's a cold day and the line is out the door, you know there is something special about the food, drinks, people, or all of the above. The jerk chicken and gravy is amazing and pairs nicely with the cole slaw which adds some sweetness to cool down your mouth from all of the spices. The lunch portion is $5 and is your typical small square styrofoam box which comes with rice and beans, choice of jerk chicken / fried chicken / potentially some other protein, and choice of salad or cole slaw.  Make sure to also try the delicious home made bottled juices - mango passion fruit, strawberry banana and many other flavors."}
{"text":"Really good Caribbean food downtown.  The prices are cheap for quality food.  The workers are cool and super nice.  The lines were long this weekend, but it's expected during Caribana.  The jerk chicken was moist, you can taste the coconut milk in the rice, oxtail and callalou was seasoned very well.  $5 lunch specials and also small and large sizes.  Def would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in a while and maybe 6 months ago, I would have rated it 4 stars but I've tried so many different Caribbean places that are heads and tails above this place.    The BBQ chicken is a bit too sweet and drenched in BBQ sauce.  I prefer my BBQ chicken to taste like chicken with bbq sauce as opposed to BBQ sauce topped with chicken.  As for the jerk chicken, it's not bad, decent spice, but when you order the small dinner, the chicken has a lot of bones and very little meat.  In addition, the rice, while edible, isn't the tastiest.    Will I visit again?  Probably not, unless I need a really really really quick lunch."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken and the BBQ chicken with the beans and rice. The chicken was fall off the bone tender. Jerk had just enough spice. I did take out. Small seating area."}
{"text":"Jerked for the last time. Ritz has a good Jerk deal for lunch (get your mind outta the gutter). 4.99 gets you the jerk, dirty rice and coleslaw. The portion is on the smallish side but it`s filling.  The location is convenient too, right at Yonge and College. The music is loud but jiving.   Their fried or BBQ chicken is quite good too. They do chicken right."}
{"text":"I like getting the jerk chicken or ackee and salt fish here. I really like the rice and peas!"}
{"text":"I hate to nag about services on Yelp. But I feel the need to do this, for I don't want to keep the grudge to myself. The food is still good here. Yet service really went downhill.  First, the owner is friendly but other staff members are not. Also as the line during lunchtime was usually quite long, they made mistakes on what dishes each customer wanted and gave me the wrong order. I just took it as it was since I still liked their food and I did not want to make a big fuss of it.  Things were alright until last time I was there. The girl at the cash register kept flirting with the guy in front of me. However when it was my turn to pay, she immediately switched to a cold face. She looked at me blankly, as if she wanted me gone asap. It seemed that she tried to limit her verbal communication with me as well, no \"hello\", no \"thank you\". Nothing. I had to ask for a bag too. If she had treated the guy before me the same, I would not be too upset - as I would just assume she was only not very happy with her job, or she was having a bad day right?.. Unfortunately it was not the case. I guess it is my fault for her that I don't have a \"better looking face\" but treat all your customers with basic respect please!  I will go to A&W across the street from now on. At least I can get proper treatment, and friendly smiles most times in addition to good food there."}
{"text":"I have been going to their Yonge/Eglinton condition and the food quality has been consistently good. Tried the barbecue chicken at this location. The taste was not too bad. However somehow I felt that it was not seasoned properly, since it was somewhat greasy and tasted different than all the bbq chicken I had at other Caribbean places. Hope they improve on it. The restaurant itself was very clean and service was decent."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special, which cost $6.77 including tax. The line was quite long during lunch hours but moved quickly. It was assembly line style and everyone was ordering the same lunch special. You get a choice of jerk, bbq, or fried chicken and coleslaw or salad. It all comes with rice. I had jerk with coleslaw. It was all very good and at the right temperature. The jerk chicken had the sort of heat that builds up and congregates at the back of your mouth. Originally, I thought the portion was a bit small but I felt feel full and satisfied. My friend (who is quite a big dude) wasn't too full though. I enjoyed everything and plan to come back for lunch again. The fried chicken also looked very good as well so I'd like to try that next."}
{"text":"Remarkably my first experience at a Ritz location. Usually get West Indies food on Eglinton W but had heard good things.   Got a small jerk chicken with rice & beans and coleslaw. Extra gravy on the rice. Small was a ton of food for $9.99. Easily could have gotten by on the $5.99 lunch special but no worries.    Jerk was fall of the bone and nicely marinated. Rice and beans were solid as well with the gravy. Got a small container of scotch bonnet style hot sauce on the side too, which was nice. Coleslaw was a little too sweet for me, as opposed to vinegary, but that's just my preference.   Staff was very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"When they first opened, I thought their BBQ Chicken was excellent.  I was going there every few days.   I went back two more times in the past two weeks and don't think it's the best anymore. I find the chicken too sweet now and they also don't seem very hygenic.  It's the same person serving/cutting the chicken and also acting as a cashier.  They don't use their hands to touch the chicken, but something just seems wrong with it to me.    I'd rather go to Tropical Palms down the street."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the $5 lunch special at this place. Very generous portion of rice, salad, and your choice of BBQ chicken, Jerk Chicken, or Fried Chicken. And the best part...YOU CAN GET OXTAIL GRAVY ON YOUR RICE FOR FREE!! If you're looking for a cheap place to get lunch definitely check this joint out."}
{"text":"Firstly, I give this place extra points because they offer seating where most Caribbean joints are strictly take-out.  The staff looked groggy and could use some Tylenol Extra Strength.(Was about to insert a different drug name but wanted to avoid any racist connotation).  I don't blame them since business is constantly busy.  Despite this drawback, their food made up for their mediocre service.    The curry goat was absolutely succulent.  The sauce had a nice texture to it; not too thick or too watery.    The Jerk chicken legs were super tender.  Its colour was nicely charred on the outside.   The rice & peas had the perfect amount of moisture to complement the protein.  Furthermore, it didn't have any thyme stems in it."}
{"text":"Ritz is no stranger to me. I've been to many Ritz locations across the city. To this day I have not found a franchise that makes it better than the one on Yonge and Eglinton. I ordered a large portion of half Jerk chicken and half Fried chicken (10.99).   The Jerk chicken is moist, tender and falls off the bone. For the other half of fried chicken, I wasn't a fan. The fried chicken was nothing to brag about. They slather gravy on the rice n peas. I am a fiend for coleslaw, and coleslaw here is on the sweeter side with hints of onion.  Employees seem to be very generous with portions.  If you're looking for a quick bite, go to this place. It's a hearty meal that you can't compare in price."}
{"text":"When I'm in what I consider the west end of town I enjoy this caribbean comfort food. The jerk is great, One of the better jerk seasonings in town...  The quality of food is good, but I should mention the quantity, it is a fair amount in a small portion.   In the winter weather there is no better place to warm up with some good jerk chicken and a refreshing ting.   BONUS....they had just installed a flat screen tv."}
{"text":"Yonge and College:  I have been going there for over five years and I can honestly say they have some of the best Jerk Chicken in the city. The lunch special (11am-3pm), which is now 4.99, is still well worth the money. With the special you can order the Jerk, BBQ or Friend Chicken, all come with Rice & Peas as well as a Salad or Coleslaw (go with the slaw). I have also tried the curry chicken/roti and was not let down.... As said, been going two days a week for five years and will keep going back.   There are other locations on Yonge, one at Yonge and Shutter (right by Eaton Center)... there was one closer to Yonge and Bloor, not sure if that one is still open. Anyway, reason I point that out is that the food does taste different and the portions are smaller at the other locations... just a heads up."}
{"text":"Beef patties ($1.25) are sooooo good!! 5.99$ lunch spacial is pretty decent as well. others are quite pricy consider the interior decor.  really good for grab and go. need cash for lower than 5 bucks."}
{"text":"A filthy rat-hole, and I mean that literally. THEY HAVE RATS HERE and in the Falafel place next door. In addition, you might notice that they have a green pass on the door. Look more carefully. It's marked \"CONDITIONAL\" You can look this up on the Toroto municipal website. Let's check their violations: - Operator fail to maintain hazardous foods at 60C (140F) or hotter (marked as a CRUCIAL HEALTH HAZARD) - FAILURE TO PROTECT FOOD FROM CONTAMINATION (marked as a SEVERE HEALTH HAZARD) - FAILURE TO ENSURE / PROVIDE FOR PROPER EMPLOYEE HYGIENE / HANDWASHING  - IMPROPER MAINTENANCE / SANITATION OF NON-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES / EQUIPMENT  In addition, they have rats in the kitchen. Not mice, RATS. To top it off, the place has received multiple complaints, but continues to blast radio from a blown-out exterior speaker, into the street. If you read this and still choose to fund this operation, you deserve to end up in the hospital with food poisoning and maybe rat babies growing in your intestines."}
{"text":"Great jerk.. Really good rice. Kicks ass, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ritz is a super small caribbean joint on Yonge Street. I went once at lunch, and the lines were out the door. I've never had caribbean food before, but I love rotis (indian rotis), so I figured there was a good chance I would like this place.   I ordered a veggie roti, they had it on their menu, but i didn't see any distinct veggie dish on their hot counter/building area.  The good thing is that their rotis are made to order, which is also a negative thing because they take a little while.  My veggie roti was pretty good, there was a lot of potato in there. They have bottles of hot sauce on the tables, everything there is mild, so if you like hot, you can dump a load in there.    The actual roti (the wrap itself) was amazing. I don't know how they make it, but it's like a layered slice of heaven.  Pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"Perfect spot near the hotel my friend and I stayed. The food was fresh and reasonably priced. The flavors reminded us of being on an island retreat. Don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"The environment is not on the classy side. Service is hit or miss and most of the time miss. The food is just okay but with the price one can't complain much."}
{"text":"Falling off the bone jerk chicken and oxtail.  If you shake it, it will literally ooze off the bone - so delicious.  Probably the best I've ever had in Toronto, NYC, Brixton or Jamaica.  It seems to be mainly the Yonge and Shutter location that is good though.  Their jerk chicken and the different gravies have a sweetness to it that is so delicious.  The cole slaw is creamy and the plantains are also amazing.  This place really hits the spot if you want some home cooked Caribbean food.  I've yet to have anything better.  The value and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Wow I really wasn't expecting much when I found this place due to looking for a easy cheap lunch in the Eglinton and Yonge area (can be hard). I got their very popular lunch special for $4.99. The restaurant was not crowded and had plenty of tables to eat at. I ordered the jerk chicken lunch special, it was very tender and the sauce was not too spicy for me and complimented the coleslaw and rice. What a great deal! Definitely a new spot for me to go whenever I am in the area again! I am one full happy camper!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my review. Since last visiting, I have notice some significant changes. The quality and quantity of the food has diminished. I use to love the slaw but now the taste and amount they add to the meal is pitiful. The amount of chicken use to be very generous but now it looks like a gnawed on bone.  I understand the cost to lease a commercial space in Toronto is expensive but I would be willing to pay a bit more for the same great food they use to make."}
{"text":"This place was my first time trying jerk chicken. Decent all around, but not outstanding. As with most fast food places, the freshness suffers, but the flavour is still satisfying. Service is minimal; pretty much what you'd expect from your typical fast food."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonable prices, lovely staff.  The only minus is that service can be a touch slow.  I've lived in Caribbean and this makes it more authentic but if you are in a rush, you may be frustrated here."}
{"text":"This doesn't even make it into the top 5 chicken roti's I've had in Toronto.  We're talking about dark meet all cut up and pre-mixed with curry and potato and the occasional bit of carrot (?), then spooned into the roti in a take-out container.   But the reality is that a curried chicken roti for $8 is a great lunch time value proposition, and for filling that need I'll still give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"4 stars based on the lunch special. $6.75 after tax gets you your choice of chicken (jerk/fried/bbq) and a side dish (rice & peas/fried dumplings/something else I forget) and a bit of salad (coleslaw/house salad). There are usually lines, but the lines move quick.   I find dining in gets you a bit more of the rice than when you get it to go, so if you want the extra filler ask for it on a plate instead of in styrofoam and save the environment in the process. The jerk chicken isn't my favourite jerk chicken in the city, but is adequately pleasing in an area of comparably boring food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always got something different..  but yesterday, I had the Jerk Chicken.  It was DIVINE. I got a small portion, which came with TONS of rice n peas, and the Jerk Chicken, and the lady was nice enough to put some beef stew gravy on my rice. It was amazing.  Lemme get down to it. The chicken was amazing.  Like fall off the bone sexy.   All that jerk spice.  PERFECT JERKY GOODNESS"}
{"text":"Ohhhh super delicious.  Just went here with my co-workers for lunch.  It has a good review on Yelp and it did not disappoint.  Highly recommended for some good Caribbean food.   Food: 4/5, I got the jerk chicken (small) and it definitely wasn't small and the chicken was just fall-of-the-bone juicy.  The jerk spice was quite spicy for me but tasty.  The rice was good too but too much.  I might get the special instead next time.    Service: 3/5, not much as it is more a take-out but the server was nice  Ambience: 3/5, nothing out of ordinary but nice small restaurant feel and easy-to-read menu  Price: 4/5, around $10-$15 per person.  There is large ($15), small ($10) and special ($7).   I would want to try the fried chicken next time - it looked very good from the buffet bar."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Ritz. Got the lunch special for cheap. The jerk chicken was pretty good but I didn't like the quality of rice they used for the combo. Overall, my food was good given that I only paid 6 bucks ."}
{"text":"Super cheap and I can see why people like it! When I was a veghead and worked @ yonge/queen, all my coworkers would go and the smell would drive me crazy because I couldn't eat it. Now as a macro-counting, protein-loving queen - yooo. I had to try it!  The line wasn't long, but I've seen it go crazy. There's always a seat to sit on, because most people tend to grab and go. I didn't know what to get to the line was moving so fast, but I just went for the lunch special like everybody else. Jerk/fried/bbq(?) chicken + rice + coleslaw. For under $6. Blasphemy! The portions are NOT that small.... it's a small box but made me so full. 3 pieces of jerk chicken, which were spiced nicely and tender. Coleslaw that I actually quite enjoyed because it was fresh and crunchy.. with a very unique flavour. This was the first time I didn't do my usual method of eating coleslaw (aka throwing it out immediately)! The rice was flavoured well with means and it was enough carb to keep me full for the rest of the day until probably 11pm?  Overall, very worth it. Service is short and blunt but quick."}
{"text":"It's all about the lunch specials!  4 pieces of jerk chicken with rice and peas and side of coleslaw -$6. I've tried Alot of jerk chicken, including Jamaica, and I think this place is on point.   Other lunch specials are fried chicken and BBQ chicken.   I'm told to always get your food in take out containers bc you get more!  Ha Place can get busy,  be prepared to wait in line.  It moves faster than you think.  Sign up for Ritual and I think you can get a coupon for pick up."}
{"text":"Do you know how badly I wanted to give this place 5 stars?  The food tastes like some type of God spread his cheeks and dumped a load of \"greatness\" on my plate.  I know that's intense but I'm not kidding.  The Jerk and BBQ chicken dinners are... immaculate.  All of the positive reviews about the food are accurate.  But I can't eat there anymore, cuz the negative reviews, are even more accurate. This place is just DISGUSTING and its not up for debate.  People only look the other way cuz the food is SO succulent.   I would advise against eating this on your lunch break. Liquid loads burn and make it hard to focus; this food comes out like lava. Clenching the anus all day...  The last time I had the BBQ chicken, I found a weird bean shaped clump in it.  I chewed this thing folks; it was in my mouth!  I spat it out immediately but I'm still haunted by those moments it spent on my tongue.  It was a nasty piece of rolled up paper towel! Broke my heart. I took mugshot pictures of the paper;  frontal and profile.  I was psychologically destroyed after this.  I also became violently ill with the flu the day after. My theory is, I caught the flu from the paper towel.  I called the Ritz cuz I just wanted to know what the paper towel was used for before it made a cameo in my lunch.  There was no answer.   And THAT's what keeps me up at night.   2 STARS!"}
{"text":"Compared to 450 Yonge... Young woman behind the counter seemed annoyed to come to get my order.  Servings small. Hardly any meat on the chicken bones. Sauce wasn't near as good as 450 Yonge. They had no coleslaw in my box.  The cashier didn't wash his hands when he handled food in the food area.  Overpriced for what I got."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of jerk places around the city and this is still by far the best. The jerk chicken is nicely spiced with a flavour that penetrates right down to the bone. Rice and peas and coleslaw are brilliant too. Forget about comparisons to portion vs price. When it's this good it just doesn't matter."}
{"text":"This location has recently gone through major renovation. It's new and clean.  While I suppose that's good the old place had character.   Gone is the flavourful skin, meat and bone that made their jerk chicken so much tastier above the others. No longer do I see sprigs and bits of spices in my meal. Rice and peas is average. The food has become the same as every other jerk place in the city. I am sad.   Service friendly, establishment clean.  3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken for take out. It came with coleslaw and bean rice. The portions were nicely generous and the food was actually very tasty. The slaw was sweeter than I'm used to but still nice. What I didn't like about the food was the way the chicken was cut. I'm not sure why they do that but the meat was chopped into small pieces which is ok but had shattered the bones and made eating difficult as there was little pieces of bone with every bite.   Food: 3.5/5 Price: 4/5 Service and atmosphere: NA Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"More 3.5? Don't let the interior fool you, it looks a bit dodgy but I thought the food here was quite good. I ended up ordering from regular menu, never been here but one of the customers in line was nice enough to let me know that you can do half/half when ordering. So I had 1 large dish with half jerk chicken and half BBQ chicken with sides of boiled dumplings and banana. They were out of fried dumplings at the time but the boiled dumplings were quite soft and tasty too. Overall, food here is quite yummy and would definitely recommend it.   I wouldnt bother with dinner special though cause I thought the portion was quite small even if its a few dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here after craving Jamaican stew as I haven't had it in awhile. I was actually disappointed by the blah flavour of the goat curry and rice and peas. There was no flavor in the rice. The portion wasn't what I thought. I got very little goat, rice and coleslaw for $9. I think I'll get better value at Jerk King or Indira's Guyanese Cusine."}
{"text":"The lunch special jerk is $4.99. Good for lunch. It's a small portion with 3 pieces, rice and peas and coleslaw. Tried the beef patty. It's only $1.25 but tastes average. The coleslaw is really good. The place is also clean and has lots of tables to dine in."}
{"text":"It's the kind of place you wish you heard of and got lunch at once in a while when you attended Ryerson, rather than afterwards. Their bloody savoury and juicy jerk and barbeque chicken certainly has bland campus food and College Park mall grub beat by a long sprint, especially when coupled with a $5 lunch special. Still pretty decent and cheap fast food at all other times too.  The cleanliness of the greasy-spoon-basics dining area isn't always up to par, and the music's usually ghetto-blasted loud. But Ritz mostly serves a takeout crowd. Your order is overstuffed with rice and coleslaw, and will have your tummy jerked full and your tastebuds dancing the moment you walk out the door.  It's not exactly the best Caribbean food in Toronto, but it's hard to complain about the value you get out of that warm styrofoam container in your hands."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a jerk chicken connoisseur, and I've been on a mission to find the best jerk in Toronto.  So far this particular location of the Ritz has my vote.  I've tried a couple of the Mr. Jerk spots, as well as Pat's Homestyle, and the jerk chicken at this Ritz blows them out of the water.  The other jerks tend to have more of a smoky flavour and are drier, whereas the jerk from the Ritz is ever-so-tender, with the chicken full of juices and ready to fall off the bone.  Every time I am in the area, I try to stop by and grab some."}
{"text":"For some reason, I really like this place.  If I want to get tasty food in a jiffy and I'm near the Dundas Square/Eaton Centre area, this is my go to spot.  The jerk chicken is fall off the bone goodness, and they are always generous with their servings.  I've taken guests from out of town and they always enjoy the meal here.  Perfect for a quick tasty stopover."}
{"text":"VIBE Fast food sans the polish of a typical North American chain. Think of the gawdy green tile and not-quite-unclean feel of a food joint you might pop into while travelling. Loud radio station advertising cheap calls to the Carribean.  SERVICE Long counter of foods ready for spoonin. Disgruntled Asian woman armed with large spoon stands at the ready (the Toronto standard).   ROTI $8  I was experiencing serious order-regret when I watched the roti skin get unwrapped from tinfoil and microwaved. This was filled with a huge spoonful of curry potatoes, another of curry chicken and a good dose of hot sauce at my request.   I sat down at the bar by the window to watch Yonge street passers-by as I dug in to the appropriately massive portion (appropriately because rotis are supposed to be massive.) It was suprisingly REALLY TASTY! I like my roti super spicy and a lot of places my roti ends up just tasting like hot sauce... not here. Spicy enough to make a couple of tears stream down my cheek, but the rich, saucy curry was the main event.   My only issue is with the roti skin... it was kind of dry and when the layers peeled apart I could see that the flour was clumping in weird bits. See the photo. Nat cool.  BOTTOM LINE Came here against what I thought was my better judgement, but it actually turned out to be pretty tasty... if it was cheaper or had a better roti skin you could call me a fan, but not quite."}
{"text":"Good lunchtime spot.  I am a big fan of the curry chicken and jerk.  The only downside is that the food tends to be really greasy and the rice is dry.  Overall, good tasting food."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 stars for me. Initially when I walked in and heard the music blasting I wasn't too happy as I could barely communicate my order to the people behind the counter. It didn't get better when I found out a chicken roti is like 8 freaking dollars but I must say it was mighty tasty and very filling. The roti's were nice and soft and everything was made well.  I'd probably come here more often if it wasn't as expensive but it's definitely a good place for Caribbean take out!"}
{"text":"This is no Alberts.  Slow to order, music is loud, food is bland and dry."}
{"text":"From the outside, Ritz's looks like a dump. But don't let that fool you, during lunch time, the place becomes a eclectic place filled with both blue and white collar types lining up for food. Why is it so popular you ask?  Three words: Tasty, Hearty, Affordable  For 5 dollars and change, you can get three pieces of succulent Jerk Chicken,a hefty amount of rice & peas, a slice of plantain and coleslaw. To top it all off, it is smothered with a tasty ox-tail gravy.   The chicken itself is moist, juicy and tender with a good kick of spice. It literally falls right off the bone making it easier to eat it with a fork and knife. For that extra quick, they do offer scotch bonnet pepper sauce on the tables if you are dining in .    Now, when you compare this to other places in the area, Ritz's definitely offers the most bang for your buck for lunch and leaves not only your tummy but also your taste buds satisfied."}
{"text":"New owners/management suck:(  Was a regular here.  Food was always consistently awesome.  Their old gravy was so flavourful.  Now they give you some oily drippings as their gravy.  They somehow cut the thighs extra short so you get less chicken, two pieces instead of 3 compared to other Ritz locations.  Not sure where or what they do with the other bit of thigh.  The hot sauce fills maybe 3 millimetres of the container which is a joke.  The rest is empty.  If you get the bigger size the just give you one extra leg and a lot more rice which is also a waste.  Their rice and peas is now really dry and undercooked and has no flavour but a lot of salt.  Jerk chicken used to always be hot and on point.   Now it's dry, barely hot and less flavour.  A couple times since they changed owners I have gotten rotten salad leaves in the salad.  On a note about staff.  The guy who regularly works at the counter has no customer service skills.  He's rude, doesn't even look up at you most of the time, doesn't give you a second to look at the menu or hot table before demanding your order.  He'll pretend to write it down then forget an ask two more times because he's trying to take multiple orders at once.  He'll sometimes just walk away from the counter for no apparent reason in the back and just leave customers in the lurch.  Their debit machine is down a lot of the time, and won't tell you until you get to pay.  Also chronically low on change as if they are running a lemonade stand.  Saw one guy get a roll of coins as change because they ran out.  Overall I'm sad this place had such a slide.  It's bad for the Ritz brand.  A lot of people use to come here.  Always a huge line that ran like clockwork.  They just killed a good thing:(  I hope the old staff found new jobs and continue to cook somewhere else.  They are missed.  PS I love Jamaican food, Ritz on College will be a good backup when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ritz is to jerk chicken as McDonalds is to the burger; you can't go wrong or right with it. It fills you up when you are craving for jerk but it won't leave a lasting impression for sure.  I do occasionally visit some of their nearby locations for when I am craving jerk (since there aren't many options for Jerk around the Yonge and Dundas area). The price for their daily lunch special is cheap but the portions are on the smaller side as well. For about $6 you will get one chicken thigh and about a bowl of rice and some slaw which leaves me feeling unsatisfied. I can't eat another one but at the same time I am not quite full yet. :("}
{"text":"Very good, will be definitely returning!   Good selection of food, nice hot sauces, and great prices for the amount of food you get (you dont feel like your getting ripped off)  Was a little annoyed when I went, they never had the dumplings or carnivals available, perhaps its to show the food is 'fresh'"}
{"text":"Beware when ordering the chicken roti, the flavour is tasty but you will spend a solid amount of time picking out bones and pieces of cartilage. The Yonge and Dundas location is a much better option."}
{"text":"Fast Food prices. Ritz is a great place to have decently meal in TO, I wanted to taste something that was unique to TO (Caribbean).  I had the Ox Tail curry with rice and peas, for $8.00 very good price, great flavors perfect spice. Also had Jamaican patties beef and chicken they were awesome for $1.50 each.  Will be back anytime I visit TO."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I wouldn't call this Authentic Caribbean food. Lacks flavor!   Giving two stars because service was good."}
{"text":"My first crack at Caribbean food in Toronto!  Not bad and cheap!  Filling and flavourful.  I really can't say too much because I only tried the one thing on their menu: jerk chicken.  I've never had plantains and oxtail before. I have to say, now I want to eat that with my chicken all the time.  In fact, i bought some plantains the other day so I could make some chicken with those on the side."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 because it is one of my go to for lunch. I go here on the regular and they never disappoint. It's filling and the lunch special is the best!   You can get fried chicken, BBQ or jerk leg, on a bed of rice and peas, topped with their sauce and a choice of either salad or coleslaw. The sauce is so good, I can eat the rice and that alone.   It's a hearty portion. I rarely finish the lunch special in one sitting. I mean, it's doable, but definitely a lot for what it's worth... Which is a very good thing. My coworker told me about this place and I'm glad she did.   If you didn't know, this is a franchise. I haven't been to other locations, but this one is solid.   After 12, this place starts getting a long line up. By 12:30, it's almost to the door already. Its always like this, at least whenever I go. All the food is prepared already, so it's a matter of landing the plates. It's a long line up, not because they take a while, it's just that they're that good.   The lunch special is $5.99, plus tax."}
{"text":"Looks like the management has changed since I've been here last. The food is not good as it used to be. So unauthentic. The rice and peas was tasteless. The salad looked old and was turning red at the edges and when I said I didn't want it. The cashier gave me a bad look like I was supposed to eat spoiled salad? The coleslaw looked like it was sitting out for days n run u belly so didn't want that either.....Won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"Solid caribbean food and quick!  I usually get the BBQ chicken with their amazing bbq sauce and rice, beans and coleslaw.    Subtracted a star since I'm not a fan of digging through bones (They give you whole chicken legs and thighs and just chop them up) but good overall."}
{"text":"I used to be such a fan, often getting my lunch here, and even got my kids hooked. More recently, since they re-opened after some renovations, they have consistently disappointed me. There's a guy there who is impatient, yells too much; I can no longer make simple substitutions; and more importantly, the food just isn't as consistent in quality or taste. Two weeks ago the jerk chicken was NOT spicy at all; today, it's burnt and I had to throw it out (no time to go back!). I go at least once a week and bring my kids once a month, only one person seems to ever remember or care for customer service. As much as I love the value, it's just not worth it any more. I will be looking for another place."}
{"text":"Just finished my small ox-tail lunch and it was delicious :) Hot, fresh and full of meat.   The staff was friendly and the place looked clean.   I'll be back"}
{"text":"Me and my friends went in for a Saturday lunch. No customer was at the restaurant at the time.  We ordered plates of jerk chicken combos and they were cold..  Taste: 2.5/5. It's not the best jerk chicken I've had. Other than being cold, the sauce was mediocre, also the coleslaw that comes with the combo is too sweet. Rice was also cold."}
{"text":"Super flavorful Caribbean cuisine! Loved their jerk chicken. The price is also very affordable. You can get a meal for under $10. Since the food is pre-cooked, it's very fast as well.  It's a great place to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood, perhaps before a movie in SilverCity. ;)"}
{"text":"Best you'll get downtown. Obviously Jerk Chicken or Oxtail are the go to orders, but the other dishes look pretty good. No huge complaints, better than the local competition."}
{"text":"The food here is good. There isn't much else in the area in terms of Carib, so I come here for lunch once in a while when I'm feeling like it. They have lunch specials which is good if you're looking to be budget wise, but it comes in a tiny box.   The oxtail gravy is awesome, be sure to add that onto your rice. The oxtain itself is tender and with just enough spice not to leave your lips on fire.  Only thing is I'd say it's a little expensive, but it's downtown so not sure what else you can expect. And always expect a line up all the way to the door, as the service here is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Awesome jerk/bbq chicken. Wish they gave more coleslaw."}
{"text":"After being told by my co-workers about the jerk chicken many times. I finally went to The Ritz Caribbean Foods. I found it a bit warm as the place is not air conditioned and a bit small. The atmosphere was nice and the menu had a good selection. I ordered the half pound of chicken (Two thighs) I dont know if it was actually half a pound as I was still hungry after. Apparently they use to give more than they do now, but what can you do? Besides these downsides, I found that the jerk chicken was delicious. To an average person it will be a little bit on the spicy side. If you can handle your heat you may find it mild but flavorful. The chicken fell off the bone and was moist. I would go back to try some of the many other options that they had. I would chose to get a side or some carbs with the meat to satisfy your hunger. I enjoyed the taste of the jerk chicken and would recommend this place to others to try."}
{"text":"Their soups are very good.  I have also tried the lunch specials including the jerk, bbq and fried chicken.  Very good food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I'm no Caribbean food expert, but my tastebuds tell me this is good.   I live about 2 minutes from Ritz, so I eat here a lot. It's cheap, the portions are huge and it's delish. Between my boyfriend and I, we've had jerk chicken, fried chicken, bbq chicken--all of which are always moist and so flavourful. We've also had the oxtail dinner, goat dinner and veggie roti. We've had better oxtail, but it's still yummy. I really have nothing to compare the goat or the roti to. Let's just say, if I'm not in the mood for chicken, I'll get roti and I'm glad I tried goat, but it's maybe not my favourite.   Most dinners come with garden salad or coleslaw. GET THE COLESLAW. I was skeptical at first because I find that coleslaw is generally hit or miss. This coleslaw tastes very fresh and, let's face it,  garden salad is boring!  I have no complaints about the music. Sometimes it's louder than others. I've never experienced it so loud that I couldn't order."}
{"text":"$4.99 Jerk Chicken lunch special (with rice and coleslaw) from 11AM - 3PM.  I would recommend eating in rather than take out as the portion seems bigger when you dine-in and you have access to the hot sauce scattered around the dining area.  The jerk chicken is well-spiced and succulent.  That's all you really need to know - you don't need to know about surly staff or the loud reggae they blare.  It's part of the charm."}
{"text":"hit and miss. had the fried chicken once and it was amazing. ordered it another time and the server didn't seem like she minded giving out the last two left over scrap pieces with the large my husband ordered. also, no coleslaw left at 7:30pm on a friday night, no hot patties, they gave me 4 from the freezer in a paper box. it was a little weird lol but hey great jerk chicken and goat curry.... of all the times i've been there i've NEVER seen the oxtail actually available. wonder if it actually exists tbh lol anyway just go for the lunch specials and jerk chicken. take out is a good option but ive placed ritual orders that have never actually been made for when i get there, they just wait too u get there and then make u wait for it anyway. ritual here is pointless lol"}
{"text":"Ritz has really grown on me. I like it more now then before. I usually get jerk or BBQ chicken. Heard the fried chicken and soup is also very good. Portions can vary depending if they are busy. They have lunch special till 3pm."}
{"text":"Ritz has several locations in the GTA and this one has several similar competitors in very close proximity. The location appears to be clean and relatively well maintained. They have limited seating and most of their business is take-out, typical of most Caribbean restaurants.  I ordered the King Fish dinner. Sold out. Snapper. Sold out. Not a good start. I ended up getting Curry Goat, Curry Chicken, Stew Chicken, and Beef Soup (for take-out).  The food was disappointingly below average. It lacked flavour and both chicken dishes were overcooked. The curry chicken was mushy and falling apart. The stew chicken was a bit stringy, despite being drowned in brown gravy. The curry goat was lacking seasoning and gravy. The coleslaw was overly sweet. Did I taste cinnamon in there?  The service can only be described as average (speed, efficiency, friendliness, menu knowledge, customer interaction).  I happened to visit the (single) washroom while waiting for my order. Although relatively clean in appearance, the toilet seat was broken and could not be raised. The handle was broken and couldn't be flushed.  Perhaps it would have been better to visit one of their competitors..."}
{"text":"Great value for money.  But the food and service can be inconsistent at times. Also, the beef isn't that great for various reasons. Stick with the chicken and I'll think you'll be quite pleased.  Recommended:  1) Chicken roti is big and normally the curry is excellent.  2) Large stew chicken. It's often enough for 2 people. The chicken is tender and easily pulls off the bone (you rarely need your knife).  3) jerk chicken special. not the best ever, but crazy cheap.  Plantain is unfortunately too dry 50% of the time."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to grab a hearty meal or a bite to eat on the run or before a movie around the corner. The food is all laid out in front of you to choose from. The service is fast and it's easy to see what is available or attractive at the moment and just go for it.   The jerk chicken is moist, delicious and just spicy enough to give a good kick. Always get a side of fried plantains, you won't regret it. I tried the boiled dumplings and bananas as the starches of the meal for the first time. I preferred the boiled dumplings, which are dense cakes of dough but still retains a good bite in the middle. The boiled bananas taste like a very starchy potato, which were not my favorite but interesting to try."}
{"text":"Lets start with the food. In the last 3 years, i have been here many times for lunch. The curry chicken roti is 5-star and worth the price. Consistently superb.  The jerk chicken and the special is not bad, but a little high-priced for what you get. Now the staff. Yes, the service is either a hit or miss or just ok. Then again, this is not a fine dining experience kinda place. Choose, pay, eat and have a nice day kinda place.  If you like good food and can bear the 30 seconds of ok service, then try the chicken curry roti. Watch out for the hot sauce. Its amazing but will start a fire in your pants"}
{"text":"Summary:  Even for a Caribbean take-out joint the curry beef roti is weak.  But if you're near the Eaton's Centre and enjoy blaring reggae-music this is a passable option.  Ups:  Decent price, location and portion.  Curry beef roti has tasty curry sauce that progressively gets better as you progress to the bottom.  Downs:  Stringy and dry beef.  The potatoes and carrots content was high compared to the beef.  Carrots in curry is inexcusable.    Full Review:  In my quest to find the perfect roti (West-Indian or East-Indian) my travels brought me to Ritz Caribbean Food on Yonge St. just outside of the Eaton Centre.  As you enter the colourfully decorated venue you will immediately notice the blaring reggae music, the spartan environment and cafeteria style serving area.  It doesn't exactly invoke thoughts of the Caribbean but it's serviceable.  Behind the standard buffet-type glass partitions lies the bevy of curries, fried chickens and other island-type fare.  A large sign above the servers displays a wide selection of their available meal options.  On ordering the beef roti, the bread itself is placed in a Styrofoam container while the beef is added on top first.  Then they add the generic curry sauce with the potatoes and carrots in it.  I don't know about you but to me carrots don't belong in curry as they tend to sweeten the taste and remove spiciness.    The first bite was disappointing as the dry beef on top doesn't have a lot of sauce on it.  The good news is as the meal continues down to the saucy bottom the enjoyment increases to a decently nice curry taste and a hint of a spicy finish.  Sit down and eat it in-store so the roti bread doesn't get a chance to become soggy.    At about $7 for roti it receives a 2.5 star rating at best in terms of value and taste.  And so my search continues.  Perhaps some of their other Caribbean dishes are good (my co-worker did not enjoy his jerk chicken dinner meal) but I don't feel the need for a return visit."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are so worth it. Yes the place is small and loud but it's really worth it for their jerk chicken. The coslaw is to die for. Just try it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went over Caribana weekend, and the long lines are very worth it. Everything was scrumptious except the plantains.  Had to bookmark this place for everytime I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"So I've lived right around the corner from this fast-casual joint, and I've noticed that it's pretty much always crowded -- especially at lunchtime. I found myself wandering around last week and the lineup inside wasn't too bad, so I decided to finally give Ritz a shot.  There was a sign advertising a \"chef's special\" of Boneless Jerk Chicken for $7.99, which seemed like a pretty good bet at a Caribbean joint. And at that price point, I was expecting a fairly substantial lunch (I was hungry, to put it mildly).  After I placed my order, I noticed the guy behind the counter shoveling some rice and a small amount of chicken into a decidedly small container, but I thought, \"surely they'll add more food to that.\" But aside from a far-from-substantial scoop of coleslaw, that was the extent of my meal. A meal that cost more than $9.00 with tax, by the way.  The tiny portion would've been acceptable had the food been tasty, but it wasn't. The rice tasted pretty much exactly like Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix, while the chicken was distressingly lacking in any flavor aside from salt. Spiciness was non-existent. The coleslaw was bland and unimpressive.  So color me baffled by this place's popularity, if what I ate was any indication of the quality and value of their offerings."}
{"text":"i've eaten here a few times. i love the stew beef. the food is really satisfying and hits the spot. beware, your body will hate you after eating a meal (greasy, not very healthy). but it's so yummy, can't resist it.  the restaurant is a little sketchy, not the cleanest place and the occasional homeless person coming in. but the food is pretty cheap and consistently good and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat.  Lunch special is always good only thing is the portion sizes are a little small sometimes.  Tell them to go easy on the gravy if you dont like too much salt:P"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was really good. The $4.99 lunch special til 3 pm is awesome! Comes with rice and peas or salad/Cole slaw. Ordered a side of plantains which were really good too."}
{"text":"I personally don't enjoy cracking my molars on spoonfuls of bone shards, but if that's your thing, you've found your joint here. My husband and I both ordered curry chicken roti, mainly because the digital menus were all broken so we just had to guess what options we had to order. We were smirked at when we asked for jerk chicken roti (we order this all the time at Jerk King so figured it was a thing...no?). Got two dumplings too. Carried it for five minutes home and then opened it up. First bite, bone. Second bite, huge bone. Third bite, potato. Fourth bite, bone cartilage. Mmmmmmmmm best $27 we've ever spent. Highly recommended. This is a knock off Caribbean restaurant. Felt like chomping through some warm roadkill. Fun times."}
{"text":"Ritz is one of those places that, whenever I pass it, I immediately think, \"Am I hungry? Is it time to eat?\" Because I always want an excuse to eat there. So very, very good...great food, fast service, reasonable prices. I have a Pavlovian drool response whenever I see their logo..."}
{"text":"Ordered through DoorDash:  - Veggie Dinner with Rice & Peas and Salad - Veggie Roti - Channa Roti - Plantains  Really delicious! It was mildly spiced, but flavourful. Vegetables were cooked nicely and great channa texture.  Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, and quick food! This is the ultimate combination for a winner of a lunch. The jerk chicken is the real deal and at $5 for lunch it won't break the bank.  Bored of jerk chicken? Try the BBQ chicken!  Only downside, after eating that much food you need a nice long nap."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving Caribbean food so we did take out here Saturday night. We got the large oxtail stew (~13), which came with fried plantains and the goat roti (~9). I'm a sucker for fried plantains (who isn't??), and they were delicious, although they lost some crispiness (completely normal if it's not eaten fresh out of the fryer). Oxtail was super tender, rice was good. The roti had bones in it, so a litle difficult to eat but still good. The scotch bonnet sauce is not for everyone, I'm assuming they purposely only fill the sauce container about 25% so that people don't get cocky and dunk their food in it only to burn their tongues off.  Service was very fast (most of the food are kept warm in hotel pans). I agree with other reviewers in that eating in is an experience to say the least. Good thing I live nearby!"}
{"text":"Food was so good, we came back twice during our 4 day visit to Toronto !!!!! U guys made our trip!!! Thanks so much for having us !"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and great food. Ordered the chicken stew. Chicken was very moist and falling off the bone and very flavorful. Really good portion for cost. Only thing would be would have liked a bit more stew/chicken for rice and salad ratio."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times and while the food was quite good (however, apparently the quality and portion sizes have diminished in recent months), the customer service was disturbing. The lady who took my order consistently treated me like an inconvenience, and the cook or helper was mean mugging me the entire time I was ordering. He greeted a woman next to me in line with a big, warm smile and then looked directly at me and almost snarled with an angry look on his face. There was absolutely no reason or justification for this behavior, as I was normal and pleasant. This made me feel very uncomfortable, even unsafe. Then when I sat down to eat, they turned up the music so loud I could barely hear myself think. Then a worker started sweeping around my feet as I was eating, and I was the only person in the restaurant at the time and the floor was clean! This is how they treat (some of) their customers? Shame on them!   Suffice to say I will never give this restaurant another penny, and I encourage others to take their business elsewhere, as there are many better options in this area, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is heaven! So damn hard to find a good Caribbean place outside of Eglinton West. I was recommended here by some family friends and I am so happy I came. I got ackee and salt fish, fried dumpling and fried plantain. The dumplings were like gigantic balls, amazing lol and the ackee and salt fish was delicious. Fried plantain was perfectly ripe :).  My stomach definitely thanked me from straying away from regular fast food. Another great thing was the place had a constant flow of customers unlike some other ghost town Caribbean restaurants. Only two things need to be improved; one: the place is called the Ritz lol it needs to look a little more \"Ritzy\", the place is just average, a little barren. Two: the servers need to be a little more irie if you know what I mean lol. One looked at me like she just didn't wanna be there lol. Otherwise, amazing place and ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is a huge line up for this place every day so I decided to try it since it must be amazing if so many people eat there. Now I think the only reason people go there is because it's probably the cheapest option down town. The rice was dry and flavourless,the plantain was soggy and the jerk chicken was terrible."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on a business trip in early June 2012. I was dying for good caribbean food and came across Ritz at both locations on Yonge St. The jerk chicken dinner was very tasty, chicken was moist, rice and beans flavorful and a huge portion I could not finish. I went back to also get the chicken roti which was okay. I've had better. But did not complain when I inhaled the whole thing.  I did not eat at any of the other caribbean restaurants to compare, but I did find Ritz to be of great value."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Its very filling and exceptionally flavourful not to mention nutritious and reasonably priced for what you are getting. Such a change from the usual and typical  food places in that area (ie; fast food, etc..)"}
{"text":"Their oxtail and chicken dishes are delicious. Just wish they didn't run out of plantains so fast."}
{"text":"Lunch special: Jerk chicken with rice and coleslaw for $5.99.  For that price, this is fantastic. Would I buy it at their regular price? Hell no. But it's among the best jerk chicken I've had in the city. I wasn't a fan of their fried chicken or bbq chicken, though. But the jerk is spicy, tasty, and a good choice for lunch.  4 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"My go to jerk chicken place. Use ritual to skip the line. At lunch there's always a long line for their great lunch special.   Spicy is spicy but I've had worse. Rice is good. Just a solid jerk chicken fix."}
{"text":"We stopped in because there was a line up outside the door of the restaurant at lunch time. The place looks a bit rundown from the outside but don't let looks fool you. We tried the goat curry, jerk chicken and beef patty.  The food was fresh, cooked with all lot of care and delicious!!!  All the food we ordered was divine but the jerk chicken was the best.  I highly recommend Ritz for anyone who wants a home-cooked Caribbean meal at a great value."}
{"text":"This is one of the fine establishments I have to thank for the extra weight I put on when I was working a soul-sucking job in the area.  I was medicating with food thanks to the abusive management the food at this place made life worth living.  I delighted in the lunch special which was a whopping $3.99 for jerk chicken, dirty beans and rice and some fresh 'slaw.  If I was feeling extra miserable I would go for a goat-roti.  It takes them a bit longer to make, but it's definitely worth the wait.  Don't be surprised if you find bones in the roti.  That's just the way they roll.  Now that I've broken free from the oppressive, abusive, and horrible job the only thing I miss about that time of my life are the hot lunches from this place.  I'll be back...  That goat is just too tasty to stay away from."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I love their jerked chicken and especially their oxtail with gravy.  Mmm... so flavourful and delicious.  I even like the coleslaw, whether it slapped on top or on the side (they mix it up sometimes).  The portions are large and are packed tightly into styrofoam containers.  I know it's good because although I do want to try out their other dishes, I keep coming back to the jerked chicken or oxtail because it hits the spot so good!  Yes, the place itself is a dump and I would never eat in the restaurant but this is a fast take-out place.  I come here every so often to get my fix.  At this price and speed, there is no way I'd ever make my own jerk chicken or oxtail stew at home (not that I'd know how)."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food and Ritz is a great lunch time spot to check out.  Pros: Good and Cheap lunch time specials Food is very well done  Cons: Expect a long line up during peak lunch hours  There are times where I just crave a jerk chicken or oxtail stew.  So on a day where I was off and had an appointment in the Yonge and Eglinton area, I decided to give this place a whirl. As soon as you walk in, you get a whiff of the smell of jerk, yummy!!  Then you notice the line up and you realize you will be tempted by this smell for longer than you would like, lol.  I got there at about 12:30, which was a mistake on my part.  I had the day off and should of waited till it wasn't peak lunch hours.  The line up was huge, I'd say about 25 people long at least.  Luckily, the line moves pretty fast. If you end up eating at Ritz, the line could be a problem as it gets right up to the tables where you eat.  You will literally have someone standing right beside you as you eat.  For some, that may be a bit unconformable.  Most people at lunch get the awesome Jerk chicken lunch deal for $4.99.  The chicken is chopped up for you as you order.  The \"gravy\" they put on is bascially the oxtail stew, YUM!!!  After finishing my lunch, I ordered some oxtail to take home for dinner.  That was splendid as well.  I'm always skeptical about chain places but that went out the door after my first bite.  In the end, this is a great lunch time spot.  I will definitely come here again if I'm in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"Awful. Food poisoning, and we got a big eighty dollar meal. Everyone was sick. Then they wouldn't return my emails. I would never buy from this place again."}
{"text":"Was recommend by my co worker. He specifically said the coleslaw was great. Walked 5 minutes in the rain during lunch rush to get to get to the location.   Busy place. Seating is available. Open cafeteria style layout. Ordered the large box, $12.00-ish. Got bbq chicken, jerk chicken, rice with beans, and coleslaw.     Got back to the office. Tried the coleslaw first ... I back up my co workers statement. It was great, had a hint of sweetness definitely on my top list when compared to other jerk places. The rice was well cooked, not dry. The chicken wasn't skimpy, easily came off the bone. Didn't have troubles eating with my flimsy plastic utensils. Everything was well seasoned, and tasted great. Don't forget the tiny -_- hot sauce containers, really kicks things up. It was worth the 5 minute walk in the rain.   Would recommend, good food I am a fan. Service could be better."}
{"text":"I ordered a small plate to go which consisted of rice and beans and a protein which I chose as oxtail.  This fed me for two dinners!  They were generous with their portions and their prices are really reasonable.  The oxtail was well seasoned with just a hint of spiciness and I would definitely recommend it if you've never tried oxtail.  They have multiple locations throughout the city so it's easily accessible."}
{"text":"Quick lunch here today - since I missed my breakfast :P  I'm usually always in this area (Yonge-College) and have never walked into this place - until today!   I had the chicken roti - which was a generous portion.  I think I ate half of it and it ended up going to my friend's hubby for leftovers.  I'm not the biggest eater.  The roti itself was made tradtionally with a chickpea base.  She heated that up and then stuffed it with potatoes, carrots and chicken. Chicken was tender and potatoes were perfect.  I don't know how people eat this on the go.  I needed a plate, knife and fork.  The curry was great with just a kick for spice. If you like it hot - there is more hot sauce to go around. Staff and friendly, and the hot is fresh which is always a nice thing right?   Service with a smile :D   I wouldn't exactly eat at this place - it isn't much to look at and the decor is just crappy and boring,  Looks more like a soup kitchen.   I'll pop in here again eventually because I have to try their jerk chicken... it's a must!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Disappointing!! Lunchtime queue was 30-man deep, but I don't know why. I got the Jerk chicken and rice lunch special which ended up being around $8. Rice was OK and neither bad or good. The chicken was bad. It was full of small bones, lots of skin and missing meat. The box they packed it in was small, but it ended up being enough food for me partly because they fill up the small boxes and partly because the chicken was grizzled skin and bone mostly. You have a choice of regular salad or coleslaw. The shop is loud, busy and crowded and makes the Eaton Centre food court seem peaceful in comparison. The man who took the order and placed the food in the container was polite and friendly even if they were so busy, which is appreciated. Lol @ the review before mine which says Ritz's fried chicken is better than KFC's!! What's next? A Honda is more fun and reliable than a Ford?? Winter is colder than summer? Canada is bigger than the Vatican?"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The jerk chicken is never dry, just tasty.  Really nice callilou greens.  The BBQ chicken is also great.  Servings are plentiful and very reasonably priced.  The only negative is the music, which is very loud.  Having said that, the music is also the real Jamaican thing, so it's less of a bother if you pretend you're on an island holiday."}
{"text":"You know I had to try a Jamaican restaurant ( fast food or sit down) in Toronto.   I know I got the abbreviated version of maybe the best of what Toronto could offer, but with a limited amount of time and lack of familiarity with the city Ritz looked pretty decent.  We ordered a small oxtail and a small curry goat the food was good the location was convenient and the service was friendly.   I straw away from any real critique because there was none. The food was standard and I can see why this location had a steady flow of patrons and a diverse crowd because you get what you pay for and that's a good deal both ways."}
{"text":"Happy I discovered this hidden little gem! The store is very small and has limited seating, but they do fantastic take-out. Their dinner combos are very reasonably priced and the portions are huge - good enough for two meals! You can choose your protein (jerk chicken, fried chicken, oxtail, curry, etc.), then your base (rice & peas, white rice, fried plantains, dumplings, etc.) and a side (coleslaw or salad), and the total comes to about $13. My favourite is the jerk chicken, it's extremely flavorful and they give you a very generous portion. Ritz also has one of the best coleslaws I've ever eaten, and it pairs amazingly well with the spicy jerk chicken. They also sell patties for $2 each - unfortunately they sell out quickly so if you go after 6pm they're usually out, but if you're lucky enough to be there early, make sure you grab one to try!   Overall an excellent place with delicious food. The staff, however, are not the most friendly and I never feel very welcomed there (hence the loss of one star). Don't let that deter you though - get some take-out and enjoy at home!"}
{"text":"Try the red bean soup!  So filling, yummy and awesome.  Add the scotch pepper sauce for a boost!"}
{"text":"It will do for Jamaican in a pinch, or a well-priced lunch special, but I find it average in comparison to other Jamaican food I've had. My go-to at these types of places is the oxtail, and it's not bad (a little spicier than some other places where I've had mild oxtail with no spice), but it's quite pricy and not so good that I feel the price is worth what I get. To be clear, the quantity is fine, but it just doesn't hit the spot as far as oxtail goes."}
{"text":"Dropped in to place an order on a large jerk chicken meal for take out. They were out of the beans and rice and had it quickly replenished. Chicken was cut in front of me so the juice remained within. Placed an order for a beef pattie and an order of plantain as well.   Jerk chicken was mildly spicy which I loved. The seasoning was fantastic and especially the caramelized skin. The beef patty just tasted like a regular beef patty frozen from patty king, nothing special. Plantain was delicious but had hoped to get more for the price. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Well priced here. There are a lot of veggie and fish options here too.  Rice and Peas are spot on and so is the hot sauce.  I would recommend getting the Festival (Cornbread) as a side. I'm still thinking about it.  They do use Ritual here, they need to work on it and how that process is conducted but otherwise yes I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not sure if this food came from the 211 Yonge Street or the 450 Yonge street location. One word: Terrible.  Ordered from UberEats tonight.  The shrimp in the roti was so overcooked and mushy that it was inedible and the curry was watery.  It was really only half of a standard roti and it wasn't even rolled properly.  The calaloo had a strange almost metallic like taste to it.  I had to spit it out and throw the rest of the dish away.  The Jerk chicken was a major disappointment as well.  Boring, mushy and had zero heat to speak of.  The gravy was watery and spilled out all over the inside of the bag and onto everything else.  Even the coleslaw, of all things, was a complete write-off.  It was overbearingly sweet and tasted like paste.  The cabbage in it must've been days old as there was no texture or crunchiness to it all.  Not sure about the chicken roti as my wife is still too afraid to eat it.  Complete waste of money.  Food obviously made by people who don't care about what they are producing.  Will never order from here again.  Safely can say this was the worst Caribbean food I've had in Toronto.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I ordered the goat roti for a Sunday lunch. It was pretty good. The only problem was that it has too many bones in it.  The service was friendly and quick. The restaurant was clean, but plainly decorated. I will go back because it is the only Caribbean restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness ... the curry goat roti was exquisite.  The roti shell was soft, flexible, silky and had the perfect texture, just slightly chewy but not stiff.  The curry goat and potato filling - hints of fresh thyme, just enough seasoning and a thick, luscious gravy.  This is my go-to place when I am in the downtown core.  It is so satisfying and every mouthful is a pleasure.  I love this place.  They have maintained the same incredible standards over the years.  I hope Ritz is around for the rest of my life.  Amazing place.  Good food.  Solid.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place in terms of afro- carribean food. Great people, very casual atmosphere, it's a little run down but the food is always decent. For the immediate area, which has seen a rapid surge in boutique resto pubs, it's nice to have something a bit more accessible especially after watching a movie or shopping in the area.  Food here is pretty clean which is more than I can say for most places serving the same type of stuff. I honestly wish they had more desserts and some liquor though."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but it looks like Ritz really took a dive on food quality. What was once a mediocre Jerk chicken plate has become pretty disappointing. Ordered the large jerk and got a portion of fried chicken on the side, and the meat didn't even resemble any part of the chicken. Just little bone-in overcooked knubs. Definitely on the no-go list moving forward."}
{"text":"Was walking down Yonge street and was in town for Caribana so I figured why not give a Caribbean restaurant a chance. So glad I checked out Ritz.  Ritz has a lunch special from 11-3 where you can get the special of the day for 4.99, the line was out the door when I arrived, it was right before 3 so I guess everyone was trying to get in right before the special ended.  I was lucky enough to try a variety of things, the first being the jerk chicken.  The jerk chicken was moist and flavorful with a nice kick without being overly spicy and was a quality portion for 4.99.    I also had the oxtail something that I would not normally try but I gave it a shot and it too was flavorful and delicious. Nice quality flavorful with decent size, I will say there was portion that were bony or grisly and and I don't know if that is normal with oxtail as I don't eat it often.  The oxtail unfortunately is not an item on special but is still affordable for 8 dollars.  I also tried a beef patty, that was just okay, the beef itself was flavorful but it was a little too doughy.  All the meals come with a protein, rice and your choice of a salad or fried plantain.  Definitely worth a visit if you're on Yonge street."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken at a reasonable price.  There are always long lineups here at lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the best fried chicken I had since coming to Toronto. Price is fairly cheap for the amount of food. Service is fast and casual, the staff are quite attentive."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times. 90% of the time, WORST SERVICE EVER. Obviously depends who you get, but most are terrible.   The food is good, it's the only Caribbean food in the area so it is convenient. However, expect the worst slowest and worst service. Came in for the special a few mins before 3pm ( it ends at 3pm), its a decent portion especially if you don't want to eat too much and still get through your work day. There was 1 person ahead of me, and they let another person get all chummy and work her way in line.... No problem.... But then 10 mins later ( deathly slow dithering service) deny people who have patiently waited for the \"special\". Just inane customer service. Sadly extremely poor service has happened a few times as they don't seem to care since its typically busy enough and they don't have to worry about sustaining business. Hopefully that changes.  Also portions will range depending on how you sweet talk them, so prepare to kiss ass to get more.  Avoid the beef parties (range from soggy to dried out and overheated, they've never been good). If you chance it, good luck!"}
{"text":"I don't like this location nearly as much as the Yonge and College one. Maybe because the portions are smaller, or because the service is not as friendly. Maybe both."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I want comfort food. I always order the jerk chicken, rice and beans, coleslaw and a side of plantain. I have never been disappointed with a meal from here. The service is great and efficient, and the food has been fresh. I have been to the Yonge and Bloor location as well, but it's just not the same. The food there is fine and the service is alright, but something about it feels off."}
{"text":"I go all the way from Scarborough to Yonge just to have Ritz's Jerk Chicken!  Their JERK CHICKEN is the BEST!!! I am not kidding! They have this promo every lunch (not sure if its $4.99) for a meal of Jerk chicken, brown rice, and your choice of salad. I used to get this discount meal before but my off hours from work is at 5pm.   The regular price is about $8 + tax. I love how soft the rice is and the amount of spices they sprinkled in their chicken. The meal is ginormous and I could not eat everything in the container.   i didnt know that Ritz has a lot of franchises around Toronto. Ill try the other location near Eaton's centre because its much more closer from the mall.  You guys should definitely give the jerk poultry a try and grab a drink cause youre gonna be perspiring from the perfect spices of the meal"}
{"text":"The portions are more than generous, the staff are knowledgable and friendly, and the price point is very reasonable.  The King Fish, Jerk Chicken, and Curry Goat are phenomenal."}
{"text":"I had an Oxtail dinner with of course, oxtail, and rice, as well as hot sauce that is made at the restaurant. I have not been that full in a really long time and it takes a lot to fill me up! Not to mention that, but it was a great first experience with oxtail and I am definitely going back to try some of their other food, too!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious foods!!! We had some desserts we'd never had before made of coconut. Everything served is pretty much true to Jamaican style dishes but healthier."}
{"text":"I've tried two items here-- the jerk chicken dinner and shrimp roti, which I both loved! Servings are plentiful and ingredients are fresh and packed with flavor. Coleslaw is a must as it somehow balances out the spices.. And don't forget to have some wonderful PLANTAINS! I think I may actually come one of these days just for 2 or 3 orders of plantains for snacks! I've only had meals to go and have never actually eaten here, but the tables look clean and well maintained for a small, fast-food style restaurant. Also despite the long line that usually forms over lunchtime, service is fast, efficient, and friendly. I'd like to try the barbecue chicken next time I'm here."}
{"text":"I ordered via Ritual - thank goodness I did because the line up is ridiculous at lunch! I ordered one of the Ritual member specials which was a large oxtail dinner with a choice of A) rice & peas with slaw/ green salad, B) boiled dumpling & boiled banana with slaw/ green salad or C) fried dumpling with slaw/ green salad. I opted for B as I love boiled dumpling and banana. Overall the meal was tasty but too much gravy was put in my take out container and it was spilling everywhere inside the plastic bag. Would recommend going there but use Ritual to avoid the line up!!!"}
{"text":"Full disclousre: I've never been to Jamaica, or anywhere, really.   So I can't tell you whether Ritz is authentic.   Lately, I've been questioning the notion of \"authenticity\" in cooking anyway.   What does it mean to be \"authentic\" when immigration and climate mean cultures continually jostle each other, and menus are determined as much by the ingredients that are available in one's new home and the local population's tastes as the desire to maintain traditions? Toronto is already home to several restaurants that capitalize on just those culinary and cultural mashups.   So no, I can't vouch for Ritz' authenticity.   I can tell you that this location is part of a smallish chain with outposts up and down Yonge Street.   I can tell you that service is cafeteria-style, with staff who rarely smile, but who answer newbie questions patiently and are particularly generous with the oxtail or curry gravy if you ask nicely.   I can tell you to avoid the bathroom in back at all costs.   I can tell you that $10 gets you enough food for two sensible meals; that the rice and peas (kidney beans, in this iteration) is always soft and fluffy; well seasoned with a nice coconutty sweetness. Perfect to sop up that magic gravy.   I can tell you to pick a protein, any protein; you won't be disappointed, unless you're the sort who likes their food so spicy it melts your face off (I lean that way sometimes). They used to make a deliciously vicious hot sauce available tableside. No more, it seems. A shame, since the sweet, mayonnaise-heavy cole slaw was a perfect foil.  An order of chicken jerked or fried brings randomly hacked thighs and drums (the best parts of the bird). The jerk is more depth than heat; the skin rendered to crispness, the meat stained by the marinade. it's ridiculously umami-addictive.   The fried version inspires eating by hand. No perfectly composed bites here. It's crispy and salty and juicy and good...the kind of chicken you'd want to eat in your underwear if that were a socially-acceptable thing to do.    So no, I can't tell you Ritz is authentic. I can tell you that I leave full and happy, and ready to nap at my desk.   Hopefully that's enough of a recommendation."}
{"text":"Had the Jerk Chicken Lunch special for $4.99, good portion and the coleslaw compliments the spiciness very nicely. Friend had the oxtail, generous portion as well. The interior is dated though."}
{"text":"Wow! Legitimate carribean food without robbing the bank. For $7 I got a veggie meal that came with rice, coleslaw, chickpeas and veggie mix. (I have no idea what it's called)  Very delicious and savoury, fast service and good quick eats atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ritz has been my go-to Caribbean for the longest time ever since I moved from Scarborough (shout out to Mr. Jerk). It also helps they have multiple locations along Yonge in the downtown core near Bloor, College, and Queen stations. They have daily specials, but I usually get the oxtail on rice and peas with coleslaw. The oxtail is rich and tender while the rice and peas has nice notes of peppery \"all spice.\" I believe you can substitute with regular rice and a green salad for no extra charge, but I love the way the creaminess of the coleslaw cuts through the spiciness and fat of the meats. Even when I don't get the oxtail, I like to get the oxtail sauce on whatever it is I am getting because it's so rich. For example, getting fried chicken with oxtail sauce, but last month, they said they don't do that any more. The small size dinner is a decent size for one person, but get the large if you're super hungry or want to share with another person. It doesn't seem there's much more meat though in the larger size, only more rice. Also keep in mind that if you get it in a \"to go\" container vs. a plate, they don't want you eating there, so make sure you can finish the food or be prepared to eat outside. Another pro tip: bring your own fork cause their cutlery is super flimsy and won't handle the thicker meats well. Overall, good Caribbean cuisine but I long for the glory days of Mr. Jerk."}
{"text":"It's ok but portions remain small and with more rice and breaded stuff than meat.  No particular expectations by going there. Staff is nice, place is a fast food type."}
{"text":"Ritz Caribbean near Yonge and College was the first place I was introduced to Jerk Chicken and since then it has always held a special place in my heart. Now that I'm living close to this location, it's my go-to place for when i'm hungry and lazy. They have a tiny lunch special for $3.99 that's enough to fill me (a 5'3\" asian girl) and they are open late for dinner. $7.00 dinner special.   The chicken is sumptuous and falls right off the bone. i also add the collard greens on top of the salad/coleslaw that comes with the dish for extra greenery.  I have yet to try anything else on the menu, and I don't think I ever will."}
{"text":"I usually pop in about 9:30PM for a shrimp roti after work. My favorite sever hands down is Mykhecia. She is always super friendly and always has a smile for me even if I get there at 9:50pm and she getting ready to close for the night. Her customer service is amazing and I really appreciate that after a long hard day. So thank you Mykhecia for your wonderful service and smiles and keep us the good work!"}
{"text":"This long lunch line up is worth the wait! Once they get to you it's super quick and the roti is perfect!! I always get a beef patty to go! Sitting space is limited during the week at lunch hour but any other time there's lots of seats. The rice is sooo good!"}
{"text":"I started my meal with a Mango Ice Cream--probably not the best idea in -20 weather but when you crave that delicious ice cold sweetness a girl gotta do what she gotta do   My main was rice and peas with goat curry, my favourite here at Ritz simply for the abundance of flavour and well goat, keeps you warm on a cold cold winter night in Toronto.  This place had renovated a year ago and has ample sitting areas and even some TVs, on last night was the World Juniors so sometimes a nice place to just sit, enjoy quick delicious food while watching your favourite team without being in a bar.  What you can't go wrong here is their Jerk Chicken!  So tender and simply delicious!  Give it a try if you're new to Caribbean food, it's worth the gamble!"}
{"text":"Yes the food is good and the people are nice but this is too much pricey for what it is! Jerk chicken with a small side of salad and some rice cost me 12$..."}
{"text":"I've been about 3 times to get their Jerk Chicken. The large for $10.99 is great value. They give you 2 quarter legs. The service isn't anything to write home about, but the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I just have to say the Ritz is a good time   Great (healthier) option for takeout in the area   Awesome lunchtime deal ($4.99)   Fast and friendly service   My only complaint is that sometimes my half lb chicken order is small, sometimes it's above and beyond. Kinda depends on who is serving, sadly. Minor, but this girl needs her protein!   I RECOMMEND- the jerk chicken hands down, skin and bones and all   EXTRA TIP- plantains are not always ripe/sweet so check before you order. They should be reddish/black, not golden."}
{"text":"I actually prefer the Yonge/Queen Ritz location despite the Yonge/College higher yelp rating, but both do just fine.   What can I say. For a franchise, this is great caribbean food. Perfect for a quick grub and usually consistent. I'm def a fan.   I RECOMMEND: The jerk chicken (duh) and the plantains (as a side order).  EXTRA TIP: The rum cake ain't all that.    Awesome awesome jerk."}
{"text":"This place is arguably better than the other locations because of one reason: portion size.  Ritual, or walk in. The portions here are noticeably bigger than their other locations on Yonge (College, Gerrard) and they're not cheap on the protein either. The people here seem genuinely nicer too. They do have this strange rule written that seats are for dine in only but they've never kicked me out when ordering a Ritual and staying.   As for authenticity, I don't expect it for most ethnic chains. Ritz is no exception. They cater to Westernized palates (generally this means adding a ton of sugar). Going to Jamaica and having real BBQ and Jerk chicken/pork was eye opening.  If you're getting lunch, Ritual is a must."}
{"text":"This place is cheap. Not that the food is cheap, the portions are cheap. The lines here are usually super long (can't blame them for their popularity) but they have such an inefficient way of handling the line. They should take a page out of Blaze Pizza and restructure how they take orders accordingly.  Also, what's with the cheapness on the protein?! Usually a single leg is cut into the drum and thigh. They used to do this (many years ago) and add another drum or thigh to give three, nice, meaty pieces. Now, often it is the older ladies admittedly, they chomp a single leg into 4 pieces and give you 3. What is up with that? Not only do they cut into the bone now, but bone shards are usually everywhere in your meal.   Probably won't be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Not good Caribbean food!!!! I've made better and I'm from New Jersey. I wouldn't visit this place ever again. Please learn the art of seasoning food!!!!"}
{"text":"Ritz's roti is comparable in price to other places, but a little smaller.  They have lots meaty choices to choose from, but aside from the standard \"veggie roti\" their non-meat choices remain quite limited.  Flavors are pretty solid and it's no wonder their Yonge street establishment is always busy busy busy!  The selection of specialty beverages is a nice touch and the deserts and cookies offered are moderately priced.  Overall, Ritz is a good value, but not of stellar quality.  You can do a hell of a lot worse, or better..."}
{"text":"did the $4.99 lunch special  choice of jerk, bbq or fried chicken  and choice of slaw or salad  comes with rice/beans and sauce optional  i did the jerk, it was pretty good i like that you can pay with CC  air conditioned but i did take-out."}
{"text":"Authentic island food made from the heart, with generous portions. Went for BBQ chicken and peas and rice ... would have had something curried or jerk as they looked great, And were big sellers, but I had a meeting afterwards.  Limited seating during the lunch rush, big lineup but the staff were very quick and organized so it moved along at a good pace.  Not a lot of authentic Caribbean places for lunch around the Yonge/Shuter area so it's a great option if that's your craving."}
{"text":"It used to be pretty good that I go occasionally usually close to 3pm before the end of the lunch special. I have noticed they stopped filling the chicken around 2pm, so if you go after that pretty much get a few dry pieces or no chicken at all. So technically like they ended the lunch special by 2pm? I have noticed they changed of ownership or management, now it is owned by Asian. Pretty disappointed, will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is really close to me so I decided to give it a shot. The vegetarian options are really limited, with the accompanying pictures being really hideous and unappetizing. I ordered the spinach roti which took ages to make. The portion was big (felt like it weighed 2 lbs), and it was sloppy and tasty. Comes with a little cup of hot sauce which was good because the filling of the roti wasn't discernibly spicy. Decor is no frills and vaguely Caribbean. Okay for the price."}
{"text":"The Ritz location on Yonge and College is a popular choice during lunch. Many people from students, corporate folk and just about everyone seem to drop by around the lunch hours which usually result in a line up. From 11am to 3pm, you can find the Jerk Chicken Special for just $3.99. For $3.99, you get about a quarter of Jerk Chicken, some bean and rice and your choice of either coleslaw or small garden salad.  I've been to this location many times and rarely get the chance to partake in the lunch special. Their prices aren't bad if you decide to head over for dinner as most of the food is pretty tasty. I have tried their roti and I would say for me it's average. But if you feel like fried chicken, then Ritz is a good choice if you're not in the mood for Jerk Chicken. On this occasion, I got the Jerk Chicken Lunch Special to go and headed home. For me personally, it appears that over the years the quantity for the lunch special has fallen but no worries, the quality is still there.  The Jerk Chicken is one of their most popular dishes and with good reason. I like the spiciness as its not overpowering and the chicken is almost always tender and juicy. When you get the bean and rice, they will normally ask you if you want gravy on it, you definitely want to say yes. It adds more flavour to the rice in my option. I always go for the small garden salad with Italian dress so I can't say much about the coleslaw. Although I have noticed that most of the regulars decide to go for the coleslaw over the garden salad.  Overall, I like Ritz. It's definitely more of a commercialized Caribbean joint. But I find it strikes a good balance between keeping it authentic in flavour and adding a North Americanized/Canadian touch to it. The Jerk Chicken special use to fill me, so if you're a big eater you might want to either order 2 specials or get a half Jerk Chicken to go. If you like Caribbean food or haven't tried it yet, I say Ritz is a good option for first timers. It always hits the spot for me whenever I crave it."}
{"text":"This place has the best lunch deal. $5.99 for rice and peas chicken quartet and slaw. The slaw is amazing. The rice and peas is great but the chicken is smallish. But hey for 5.99 it's delicious and a deal."}
{"text":"My lady was cravin some jerk chicken so she took me to this spot. She got a small jerk chicken plate and a pineapple soda. I got 2 beef patties. I thought the patties were decent but she is familiar with this place and thought they must be having an off night because it's usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken with rice and bean topped with ox tail gravy and a side of coleslaw was great.  It mixed well together and very filling.  I also had the Penut punch for $5 for a bottle.  The drink was interesting and should really be desert, very thick sweet with a hint of ginseng.  I was told that it was sort of a energy drink.    I was the first to walk in (1058am), and they were just setting up.  What killed me was that as I was eating, I noticed the counter guy drag out three 1.5 M long door mat and laid them from door to around the counter.  He arranged them nicely with his bare hands and then went back to the food counter and served eveyone else who came in without clean gloves and without washing hands.    I was disgusted.  Now I didn't know what part of the jerk chicken was from the ground and what is from spice.  These are tell tail signs of what is going on in the kitchen and although I really liked the food, I will never come back again."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Ritz Caribbean and I just haven't been a fan. The chicken is a little dry and they dont put enough sauce on the rice. If you want Jerk chicken go to Jerk King!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but good value for your money.  Chicken many ways and rice and peas and salad lunch specials will fill your belly"}
{"text":"The only Caribbean place in the immediate vicinity so I have gone several times. Good portion sizes.  Service is sometimes a bit gruff.  The curry lacks flavour and there is no hot sauce available.  BBQ chicken is probably the best dish here.  The jerk chicken can be a bit bland."}
{"text":"solid. lunch specials with jerk chicken are a solid pick, goat roti was excellent."}
