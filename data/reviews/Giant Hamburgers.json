{"text":"This is seriously one of the best burgers you are going to get, rivalling the top-end of the fast food chain and measuring up to any diner.  You can tell that the food is made with great care.  It's VERY informal, feeling like a 50s diner, and the staff is very friendly.  Burger looks medium-sized but does eat as a \"giant,\" and is excellent with the green chiles.  Chili cheese fries also had American cheese slices melted (not nacho cheese as someone else wrote) and chili is very good.  Reasonably priced for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Super small. Super old school. All the food we had was delicious and the malt was amazing. We will definately be back, the employees were kind patient. The only complaint i had was that its super hot in there cause of the cooktop. But will be returning"}
{"text":"Just ate at this restaurant and I was extremely disappointed. This is the first review I have written. I read reviews that were good, and I should not have believed them!  I ordered  the open faced chili cheeseburger and that was a mistake. I asked the waitress if the chili was homemade and she said no. She told me I should have gone with the bacon cheeseburger. Fries weren't the fresh cut kind and the chocolate shake was bland."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, and cheap! The cheeseburgers and fries were exactly what we wanted! We will be coming back for the burgers soon! The breakfast looked pretty good and the pies looked even better! Can't wait to bring my family here!"}
{"text":"I just had to try this place after reading all the positive reviews about it. We went here the other night around 8 P.M. Two of us had breakfast and the other had a burger. Everything was great !! all the reviews were right. You got to try this place out !!!! 
There was only one couple besides us in the place at this time of the night. Food was very good, lots of it, very reasonably priced. No problem getting breakfast at this time either. Burger looked and was told to be very good. 
Will I be back ?? 
You betcha !!! I've told my family to give this place a try. 
I only have one question about this place, when we went in, they took our order at the counter and we paid for the food, gave us glasses for self serve drinks, before we even sat down. Is this normal ? They did bring our food to the table. I saw the other couple take their dirty dishes to the counter. Is this normal for this place ? I don't know, but we did the same when we were done. Do you leave a tip ? again I don't know. I didn't notice if the other couple did or not. You usually leave a tip for the service. We left a tip. ( He did bring the food to the table.) But is this normal at this place or was it just because it was late and nobody was there but us. Please let me know."}
{"text":"The valley isn't known for its \"mom and pop restaurants\" or \"Dives\" as I affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast items."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now both times the burgers were great.  You get tired of the typical fast food burgers.. reminds me a little of lennys downtown just smaller.  the pies there look fantasic but have yet to try them."}
{"text":"When you're poor and you need a lot of cheap food, here's where you go. I have not yet tried the burgers, this is my go-to place when I am in the mood for breakfast at 8pm.

We get the triple breakfast with pancakes and chorizo and it stuffs all three of us silly and there is plenty for breakfast the next morning. How can you go wrong feeding three people for $11? It's fresh and really wonderful. Way better than IHOP or denny's or whateverthehellelse you go.

I will steer more business in their directions ASAP. Amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheeseburger and the chili cheese fries with onions. Disappointed with the chili cheese fries; too salty, small portion, not liking the american cheese topper.
Okay cheeseburger; good portion of meat but just very average.

Went to this placed based on all the good reviews. I'm starting to learn NOT to rely on these reviews as others may be limited to this area or their preception is skewed.  If you are from SoCal, this place is okay. It's definitely not a Tommy's Burger, Tom's Burger, Volcano Burger, or Johnnie's Pastrami."}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to eat at Bobs Burgers this is the place to go! Great food and amazing staff really makes this place awesome!  And yes their hamburgers are huge."}
{"text":"The woman who helped us out was extremely nice. It was a great experience as soon as we walked in the door. She did a great job of explaining what they had and how it works. I love the fact that all of the meat is local, pies made in house , and the potatoes are true Idaho spuds. The fries are delicious, the pies are incredible and the burgers; oh the burgers. They are incredible. Jammed packed of flavor and the perfect ratio of sauces and toppings. Bacon, cheese, egg, lettuce, onion, mayo, and mustard. Exactly what should be put on a burger. Sheer perfection. 

Tl:dr - Loved it, will eat again."}
{"text":"Its a good burger.  Not the best but certainly good if you like lots of pickles lettuce and tomatoes and i do so i enjoyed it.  Quaint atmosphere  breakfasts looked great  we will be back.  Its worth 3 and a half stars but not 4."}
{"text":"These are good hamburgers! They keep them right in front of you (behind the counter). Fries are crispy.

The ambiance could be better but the food is good."}
{"text":"I came in from Texas looking for a good burger joint naturally I turned to yelp and found this place. This place is amazing! Kinda reminds me of farmer boys in CA which is one of my favs. The burgers tasted fresh, no extra additives. Just lots of yummy- ness. Way better than smash burger, whataburger,  in-in out & even farmer boys. My new go- to burger place. My only complaint was the fries, but don't let that stop you from coming. My kids and hubby loved the fries I am just a bit pickier with fries lol. Their breakfast is amazingly good too, their biscuits & gravy are soooo good. & the cheesecake is amazing."}
{"text":"Tasty, Giant Burger (as the name suggests).  Really enjoyed all the plentiful tasty toppings.  Their buns definitely were not my favorite-dry, not flavorful.  Place is very dated as other reviews mention.  Several employees were friendly, one was just there.  Just had the burgers, so can't comment on any other food items.  Would have loved a smaller burger option so I would have enough room for fries or a shake.

Tips: Not all choices are on the menu board- look at the paper menu to the right of the register for additional options.  Their tap water is gross.  Buy a soda or bring your own water."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best burgers around. The breakfast is delicious also. The service is excellent. Highly recommend . And it's local. Forget the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. The food is great and priced right and made fresh when you order. Way better than all the fast food garbage you get nowadays and has an old fashioned diner feel."}
{"text":"I wonder if their burgers and dogs are better?

My friends suggested Giant Hamburgers, for their post PT run treat, after reading all the Yelp reviews. We got their around 8:30am and there were quite a few people. The restaurant itself is unassuming and looks more diner like.

I ordered the single breakfast and had them substitute the egg for just an egg white at no extra charge! You pay up at the counter which is kinda cool to me, no waiting for a check afterward. Got myself a cup of Joe which by the way was very good. :) Our breakfasts arrived and chowed down on the hash browns, egg, toast & bacon. 

Honestly, I just wasn't impressed. It was okay but lacking that true dinner flavor. I guess I just assumed it'd be like Matt's Big Breakfast or something. I think I'll stick to Liberty Market or Matt's for a tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"My cousin introduced me to this great place and I'm so glad he did! We went around 5:30 and the place was pretty much empty so I wasn't expecting much but boy was I wrong! 

We were greeted immediately and were given enough time to review the menu before we ordered. It was a difficult decision with all the possible combinations for a hamburger, not to mention the other breakfast choices. 

I kept it simple and ordered a cheeseburger with all the fixings and added caramelized onions. The burger was cooked right in front of me along with fresh fries. These fries were the best I have tasted in a long while! The burger was juicy, piping hot and dripping with cheese. The bun was fresh, warm and had a nice crunchy outside with a delicious soft finish, just like a burger should taste! 

Dessert was amazing! They had an ample selection of fresh, home-made pies, too many to list! The giant slices only set you back about $4 and is enough to share and get your fill with another person (that way you only feel half as guilty!). If you want to take some of the goodness home, a whole pie is about $12 so I thought was a fair price.

My entire meal cost about $13 which is pretty good considering I got a giant cheeseburger (pun intended), drink, fries and a delicious slice of pie! The staff was friendly and inviting, made me feel right at home. Can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Very good hamburgers! We went as they were closing and the guy already cleaned the grill but dirtied it for us. We really appreciated that he made us burgers even though it was basically closing time."}
{"text":"this place is a family favorite from breakfast to there jalepeno burger for lunch.this place is the best fast for in town the price is a bit high but im sure the price we pay is to cover that high rent he has to pay but well worth it"}
{"text":"Located in a very run of the mill strip mall. Awesome burgers though, tastes really fresh. I like that they don't skimp on the toppings. And grape soda!"}
{"text":"Came here 10 years ago and it was amazing then, just came back today on accident and its still amazing! I built my own burger and it was worth every extra cost on toppings. They dont hold back, order bacon and you get BACON! Old time feeling you dont get anywhere else in town. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Since I haven't lived in the valley for a long time I tend to rely on food reviews. When I find a good place I always try to comment. The burgers here were very delicious. They're not grilled and probably not healthy. Haha. The service was quick, friendly, pleasant.  The fries were crispy (not hard) just perfect--if you ask me. Very tasty food. It was exactly what I expected. If you're looking for gourmet, no, it's not that. But very excellent for a burger joint. I well definitely return and would definitely order this for my Midwest spring training family and friends after a game and beer drinking!! Spread the word!! This place has good burgers!"}
{"text":"Perfect burgers. Probably the best cheeseburger I've had in years. My boyfriend had the chili burger and loved it. The shakes are made with real ice cream and are fantastic. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Mouthgasm! Lol fresh ingredients,juicy meat,great fries! I added bacon, mushroom and grilled onions. So good. I forgot his name but older mex guy at counter shook my hand and was funny. I might go back Tomm...and next day after lol"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for breakfast food. My family and I have been going there for years. I love this place! A good selection of dishes. Breakfast or burgers, you cant lose."}
{"text":"Quite simply...amazing!  Granted, one might pass by this place without noticing, nothing fancy, but don't let that deceive you.  First and foremost, service - it was awesome.  I really wish I would have caught her name, but she was super friendly and helpful on our first visit.  I got the burger with Pastrami on it - yes, far from healthy, but worth every calorie!  My wife got one with a fried egg on top.  And we split the Strawberry Shake (YUM!)  I can easily say this was one of the best burgers I have had in the area.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local burger spots!
I have never had anything less than delicious here.  The burgers are a good size and the toppings are so fresh, I think that's what I like so much...fresh, crispy lettuce and tomatoes.  The fries should not be forgotten either though, sometimes they ask if my boyfriend and I would like to share an order of fries but there is no way we would ever agree to that!  
One of these days I will get to the dessert and try a piece of pie.  I just leave so full every time that I can't find any room for another bite.

The setup of the diner is a little awkward since they have two person tables right in the middle of the place but since it's a small space I can understand why they did that.  It's not like it stops the place from getting packed during the breakfast/lunch rushes either!

Other than that, I love the atmosphere. The staff is super friendly and the owner (Doug) makes you feel like family.  If you're in the area, it's a must stop-in!"}
{"text":"A place called Giant Hamburger, well, has giant hamburgers. And they are delicious, as well as the fries that come with them. Yet, the main reason that anyone should try this place is breakfast. I'm a hearty eater, so when I ordered the \"triple\" chorizo, eggs and potatoes, and 3 slices of sourdough toast, my belly screamed \"yay\" when they brought my plate. It was a mountain of food for a little over $8 and I would have eaten the plate had it been edible. Great locally owned business and I'm sure to be back again and again. I might even get a burger next time!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a hole in the wall not a chain kinda place. This is it. The people are super nice and make sure you're taken care of. The food is worth the price. Breakfast all day and PIE! Certainly coming back for more. I went around 11am and not crowded, I'm sure the lunch rush is different."}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers is a good hamburger joint; they serve breakfast also. The staff is polite and the food is good for the price. I would recommend this establishment. If you have not seen their commercial, go to youtube and look it up."}
{"text":"While the hamburgers are delicious here, I can't get enough of the grilled cheese. A perfect lunch -- when I'm not counting calories -- is a grilled cheese and hashbrowns, my favorite combination at this East Mesa strip mall gem. And if you have room, be sure to wash it down with a thick Chocolate shake. Lunch definitely won't set you back. Everything is extremely cheap and the eats will put you in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Went to this place on the recommendation from other reviewers on Yelp!  Service was excellent.  Burger was juicy and flavorful, comfort food at its best.  Fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  We were stuffed, but decided to try the Chocolate Creme Pie... this was better than expected... so much so we bought a whole pie for the kids.  We love Hawkins Burgers in Los Angeles, this is the closest to Hawkins we have found in the Valley!  This place puts any burger or burger chain in their place.  Great meal, thanks Giant Hamburgers, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special going on here. . Super expensive for what you get and frankly the burgers are  bigger at ANY other burger joint. Will not be going back ever."}
{"text":"The one star is honestly too much for this restaurant, I came here a while ago and there was a nice beautiful hair in my burger, truly disgusting will not be returning."}
{"text":"looking for a good hamburger place and came across with this place . Right when i walked in a nice guy greet us and guide us to the menu selection  . me and my wofe got the cheesburger plus sauteed onions and mushrooms  and some fries  ohhh my gosh what a delicious and fresh hamburger everything cut and make to the order  definetly will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the customer service. Doug was especially nice and friendly, made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the double breakfast and the biggest turn off for me was that they used American sliced cheese instead of cheddar. Honestly it tasted like something I could have made at home, only mine would have been better. My boyfriend got the chili dog and fries, basically canned chili with some chopped onions and slices of American cheese. We are willing to give this place another chance as we might just have to get the burgers. Liked the fries! A place with a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I eat out here with my family all the time. Great breakfast and biscuits and gravy. I don't really get why people are upset over getting charged 60 cents for using a card, please feel free to deposit money from an ATM and get an even larger service charge, at least that's my opinion. Also, just because it's called GIANT Hamburgers doesn't mean it's going to be giant, I mean do you expect your burger to be smashed at SMASHburger? Other than that, food is for sure worth coming back for. Very nice employees in the morning, can get a bit grumpy at night after working."}
{"text":"Nostalgic and family oriented, I love calling ahead for pick up too."}
{"text":"The staff was as nice and friendly as I have seen in a very long time.   They treated as though we had been there often.   This was our first visit. The cheeseburgers were delicious.   I am not usually one who craves hamburgers,  but I will crave that one for a 
very long time.   I needed many napkins as they were piled high with their toppings,  however not overly so.   Fries were perfect.   A bit crispy on the outside with tender soft inside.   The strawberry shake was thick and very flavorful."}
{"text":"I've come here before and felt satisfied but my last visit was disappointing. The burgers were okay and the fries were way to overdone. I won't be rushing back any time soon. Pies are a great deal though with lots of variety."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD! Their grilled cheese is the best! - on sourdough bread. The workers are super nice too. and their milkshakes are delish !"}
{"text":"What a nice owner! Pleasantly greets everyone and chats. Follows up to see how you like your meal. The first thing I noticed when I took a bite,  was that the food was hot! What a concept. Its so unusual, that you notice when it is. This cheese burger was fresh and tasty. All the items on it were generous in size and FRESH. They have add-ons that you might really want  like jalapeño, green chili or bacon. I  tried the fries and once again, Hot food, yessss. The decor just didn't matter. Kind of dinery. Normally the icky stained ceiling tiles would have bugged me, but this was just a really pleasant experience. Mostly because of the owner  and the fresh, hot food. Going back for breakfast which is served all day. Did I say this place is all about fresh? Oh, p.s. I almost missed it because it faces Lindsay,  not Broadway."}
{"text":"Yum. Good size portions. Fresh, clean, delicious. Love the fries, grilled cheese, burgers, pie. Thier coconut cream pie taste just like I make at home."}
{"text":"Normally I would give 4 stars but the other day, the wife and I went to eat dinner here and was really disappointed from the quality of service We got the gal behind the counter was taking our order and all of a sudden she leaves to go talk to someone that just walked in and then took his order while i was just standing there getting hangry when the good was ready she out it on the counter and said they your food is ready and walked away. The burger looked so good but I was missing my egg and baconsafe to day I think I'm going to find somewhere eles to eat after that day"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best cheeseburger I've ever had!!! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, fries were hot and crispy and burger was huge!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and the fries were delicious,  but it stops there ....  Being named Giant Hamburger,  the burger was not good not living up to its name.  Over cooked,  bacon was too tough and the meat was bland in need of seasoning."}
{"text":"Best burger in the valley 
Oscar and Fawna are the best. 
Low price good food great service.
Never had a bad meal and always welcome when I walk in the door
Don't get me started on the pie OMG!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been going here for years. We love everything they make. You have to try the pies. Not to mention the burgers and breakfast are always good all day long."}
{"text":"Came back again tonight with the son and daughter, had another perfect cheeseburger ! Son enjoyed a chili cheese dog that looked great ! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Om-nom-nom! I absolutely love this place. Super friendly staff, delicious food, great atmosphere. My friend and I always come here.
Breakfast- we order the double and a cheese omlet with pancakes. It's fresh and you get a little orange slice on each plate.
Lunch- cheeseburgers. it's a little messy but that's fine! The bun is fresh and the burger tastes great. The french fries are great too.
Dessert- the pies. ommmmm.......(excuse my drooling)... The cherry is fantastic, but the coconut cream pie is superb! Always fresh and delicious. I'm seriously about to go get some right now byeeeee!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure that these guys know what they do well and stick to it.  I had a giant hamburger and fries.  Good meat, cooked to order so it was nice and hot.  These guys take business seriously, but it was not rude or unfriendly - just matter-of-fact.  This seemed to help keep things moving, and as I was anxious to get my food quickly it worked for me.

The fries were fine - most importantly they were hot and fresh.  They were a little overcooked for my taste, but they were definitely crispy and I know many people who prefer them this way.  The burger and toppings were good, and big, and filling.  I would get this again if I were in the neighborhood and had a few minutes to spare for lunch.

This was definitely 3 1/2 stars, a rating Yelp does not allow."}
{"text":"This place is a 5 star diner because the food is what it is supposed to be, yummy comfort food, the service is far friendlier than expected and the prices are affordable.

The burger was too big for me to finish, once again living up to it's expectations and the crispy fries satisfied my craving. I didn't get to try a shake or the pies, but I will be going back. I loved the divey diner decor and staff uniforms, and the place was very clean. Great place to bring the family for an all american burger and fries."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place,  just one of the best classic burgers you can get in the state.  Fries and chili cheese fries are amazing as well.  It's your traditional diner perfected."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go against the grain here and recommend something on their menu no one seems to say anything about. The hot dogs.

What's that you say? Why eat the hot dogs at a place called Giant Hamburger? Because they use the best all beef dogs around. I don't know where they get them from, and quite frankly, I don't care because they're big and delicious. This isn't a shriveled up little wiener you find as a side item at most places, it's a big juicy 1/4 lb dog. Pair that up with always crispy and tasty fries and you have yourself a meal. 

I've also had their hamburgers and they are as delicious as they say they are, but the home style breakfasts are a favorite for us. Eggs cooked to order, sausage, bacon, or ham, on the side with hash-browns, OJ, toast, and an orange wedge to sweeten the deal. 

A friend took me here 6 years ago and I have become a regular ever since. Oscar knows us by name and is a great guy. Highly recommended.

It's cash only, and decent price for the amount you get. We usually get out of there for around $12-14 for the two of us. This place is built in the old diner style with booths, small tables in the aisles, and a counter lined with barstools. If you go in the off hours, it's generally easy to find a place to sit, but the place is usually packed during regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. 

(Side note: they'll make breakfast anytime of the day you want it. I know this because my girl had a craving for their french fries and french toast at 8PM one night... yeah. And she's not even French. ;) )"}
{"text":"The best burger & grilled cheese I've ever had! The place has a nice home feeling to it & I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So totally drove by this place everyday and thought to myself huh??..... I wonder how good their food is? Well let me tell you something. BOMB! 
 My wife had a cheese burger with mushrooms, jalapeños, and grilled onions
She loved hers. As for me I had a cheese burger with jalapeños, green chilies, and grilled onions and Mann it was so good! I even scraped the cheese paper to get the cheese. Everything on the burgers just tasted so fresh, even though we had showed up right before closing. The fries are perfectly crisp and the service was amazing and super friendly. 
  My wife and I will most definitely come back ."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you want a good, fresh burger. You can watch them grill up everything almost right there in front of you. The freshness and quality really shows. 

Their corned beef hash is badass, I'd get their breakfast more often but the hash browns can be hit or miss. Sometimes they're okay, other times they're borderline inedible, from the way they cook them or something.

The place is kinda dated, you can tell from the archaic way they go about charging credit cards, but if it ain't broke..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Don't let the name fool you. You want a great breakfast? Try their steak and egg breakfast plate or the biscuits and gravy. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Picked up a buddy, he recommended Giant Hamburgers, we stopped in, ate, went out, I dropped him off and went back to Giant. It's that good."}
{"text":"Great burgers and breakfasts...but the friendly folks behind the counter are the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good in-n-out burger as much as I do, you might like the cheeseburgers here. Good food, quick service, but not 5 stars for a few reasons: firstly, I didn't like that the restroom is two steps away from the packaged foods in the back. Also, while I was there, a customer had to ask that one of the cooks change his gloves since he had been touching the garbage can; it was only then that it occurred to the cook to change his gloves. Will I be back, despite the many health code violations? Definitely. It was a good burger."}
{"text":"They had really great customer service yesterday. Food was really good too, better than any fast food place around here and I can't wait to go back to try their other stuff! I didn't realize they have pies too! And breakfast!!"}
{"text":"ALL HAIL GIANT HAMBURGER

Friendliest staff in town and best burger in the State."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Highly recommend. Breakfast and lunch all day. Friendly, hospitable staff. Definitely my new go to spot to eat anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, I would definitely eat here again! Really nice place and friendly people"}
{"text":"Winnerrrrrrr. Excellent burgers here. I love that they heap on tomatoes and lettuce whereas most places skimp on both. Meat is never frozen per owner. Tasted great. Shake was just so so. Fries were above average but I still love McDonald's or in n out fries the best. But the burgers were the standout imo. Definitely going back here sometime."}
{"text":"Good burgers at an amazing price. 

My boyfriend and I had an awesome cheeseburger and mushrooms--which was huge and just homemade grilled burgers --fries and a shake, needless to say we couldn't finish it all! To top it off, the staff were all genuinely friendly and helpful.

We will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place could have easily had 5 stars. They brought my food out to my table. The fries were great. The burger was big...and that is about it had going for it. My meat seemed over cooked and dried out. I had a huge wedge of lettuce that I had to take off, it was so big. 

60 cents to use a debit card? Seriously? I can not believe that I just paid 11.00 for a bacon cheeseburger, frys, and drinks and then was charged to pay with a debit card. If the prices were lower than maybe I could understand the fee. 

At first glance the restaurant looks clean but as you wait for your food you start to notice the water stained ceiling tiles, and tremendous amount of bugs in the lights."}
{"text":"Love this place... Fantastic service, amazing food and everything you would want in a Mom and Pop shop! The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful. I came in because of the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time visiting tonight. Must say we will be back! Service was extremely friendly and accommodating to our party of 8 with little ones. Love to support these mom and pop business's. Burgers are big and tasty, fries seasoned and good. We had a fun delicious family dinner, def recommend."}
{"text":"the food here is awesome !!! these were the best hamburgers i've ever had in arizona !!! and the fries are fantastic !!!! crispy and hot - served perfectly!!!

excellent value for the money - i will be back  again and again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers!  Good fries, yummy shakes.  Nothing out of this world, but it surely beats any fast food burger joint!"}
{"text":"I stopped here For lunch and some of my crew came up with us. Super great food great service and the staff was super friendly. If you're looking for an awesome hamburger place this is it I would deathly recommend dry and hammers"}
{"text":"This is a good ol' fashioned diner with great food! A nice little hole in the wall spot and the ladies make the food \"just like mama made\". 
We had The Giant Breakfast, the double with French toast. The bacon was nice and crispy the French toast was soft and fluffy and my over easy eggs were perfect! Also got the steak sandwich. We don't like it when places try to make something simple too fancy. So this sandwich was perfect for us. Just a simple steak sandwich with tomatoes and lettuce.
Would definitely recommend and come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came across this place because I was looking for a place with eggs and some hash browns.This place does not disappoint. I ordered a double and it has 2 eggs and hash browns with a choice of meat. Not bad with coffee it was less than 10.00. Service is great which I like. They are very attentive. Decor is outdated but who cares the food is good and worth the price and you get good service. Keep up the great work. Next time in out this way again I need to stop by and try their burgers."}
{"text":"The food here was just ok. Burger was very sloppy, bordering on soggy. The pie was absolutely fantastic though. My largest complaint is that I was charged $64 for a milkshake here. The mistake was caught and voided but that didn't stop me from having my bank account locked down for 4 days. I'm sure it was an isolated incident, but it was problem enough for me to not want to return."}
{"text":"First off, their hamburgers are delicious and they definately dont \"suck\" as a previous reviewer stated.  Even their fries are made very nicely, and I enjoyed the food in sort of a greasy comfort food way. You know its not good for ya, but it tastes pretty darn good and hits the spot.  I dont give them four stars, because this resteraunt needs a complete dining room makeover. Its like eating in a cafateria, out of the late 80s. Very dismal, and the ceiling had water spots like it needed repaired for quite some time. Get some new decor, clean up your locaion - and u got one great hamburger joint."}
{"text":"We went to Giant Hamburgers last night for a burger fix. This was our first time, but will not be the last. I had the cheeseburger with jalepenos and it was very good. The fries were excellent and I would go there just for an order of these. I topped it off with the chocolate shake, and although this to was quite yummy, I couldn't do it justice as the burger and fries filled me up. My husband was very happy to finish it for me. He had the cheeseburger with bacon, fries and the strawberry shake. His comment was \" I will be back\" so I assume he was very satisfied with everything. Just a comment on the shakes, they are so thick you can do the blizzard upside down trick, and they will pass as my husband had to test it out. If your hungry for a burger fix, this is a place to have on your short list..."}
{"text":"My grandson and I were out and about yesterday for a fun Saturday and we went to the GIANT HAMBURGERS and had a hamburger and coke.   That hamburger is 3/4 lb of FRESH hamburger and all the trimmings.  IT IS GIANT !!   I could hardly get it all down.  But it was well worth the stuffed belly I had for the rest of the day.   I would suggest everyone come from miles around and get this burger.  I talked to the man there and he told me 3/4 lb and FRESH all day long.  They also have breakfast - I want to go try their omlettes, pancakes, french toast and burritos.  Pies and Cheesecakes - thick shakes and chili dogs and more and more.  I could go on all day.  The prices are excellent - I will never go to the other burger kings or elsewhere.  THIS IS MY HANG OUT NOW !!!  Try it - Chili - Sundae - on and on !!!
  TRY IT - You will NEVER be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a fan! Their food is great, their service is fast! I just wish you couldn't see the mess when you're sitting at the counter. The last time we went here it was really bad, dirty knives just out on the counter with spread on them, buns out of the bag just on top on things, no one was wearing gloves- I used to handle food and I know you don't have to, but maybe while you're grabbing globs of potatoes and your counter is visible to customers?"}
{"text":"First time in this spot with my spouse  and loved the classic dinner setting.the staff were super welcoming and friendly. Never got the chance to try the other items on the menu but had the chili cheese fries. As you can tell, everyone including me are suckers for their chili cheese fries.  Nice crisp fries topped with American cheese,  chili made with their beef burger patties and diced onions.  Simple but satisfying. I'd definitely have to return to explore the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"After hearing good feedback on this place we decided to try it out last Sunday. When you walk in its clear the place hasn't been updated for a while. It seemed pretty clean for the most part, just very run down and old. Clean but old grimy feel. The owner clearly isn't trying to spend any money updating the place. 

It was myself and my 3 kids 17,10,7 years old. I was kind of shocked at the menu pricing. A bit pricey in my opinion for a fast food type place. Burgers are good size but definitely not Giant necessarily. 1/3 pound patties. Anyhow, I was disappointed to see they don't have a kids size burger. Grilled cheese was $4!! That's not including fries either. Most restaurants you can get a kids meal with fries and drink for $ 4-$6. I was not happy. We ended up getting a single whole biscuit with gravy for $3.50 or so. Still over priced.  The big breakfast was like $11!!! Lol. I can get a big meal like that at Village Inn for $8-$9. Oh and don't forget a whole pie at $34.  Lol. 
Then you go to pay and they charge you like 60 cents to use a card. Are you kidding me?? My burger alone was almost $7 and you want to charge to run a card? It's called running a business, sheesh. 

We got our food fairly fast and all tasted pretty good actually. I wouldn't say the burger was better than anything I've ever had though. To be honest, In and Out or even Smash Burger, Habit are a tad better. And definitely the price is better. They use good beef as well. 

If you're in the area, it's not a bad spot and burger was good. But if your looking for Value with taste.  This isn't the spot. 

I'm thinking the place is more filled with locals that live nearby, they clearly haven't ventured out. This is no 4.5 star place! 

We drove from SE Gilbert and it wasn't good enough to return. Definitely not with those prices. And anywhere that charges to use a credit card, automatically loses my business. Cheap Cheap business etiquette. 

I hope the owner will give this place a face-lift and learn some modern times business ethics."}
{"text":"Been here twice in a week. I love my cheeseburger with onion and green chili. It's really like eating two burgers.  Good size and fresh. Very friendly staff. Wasn't ever really crowded but if you're just looking for a great hamburger, this is the place. They do have other grilled fare, but I like my old green chili cheeseburger the best. The have great pies if I ever had room I'd try one."}
{"text":"There's Giant Hamburgers and theirs Good hamburgers....these hamburgers are just Giant, NOT good. The interior definitely needs an upgrade as well."}
{"text":"Nothing to love more than a juicy perfectly made and classic burger. This little hole in the wall tucked in east Mesa is a great place for a damn good burger and spend less than $10. The breakfast, that's by the way served all day is also a must have item. If you're in the neighborhood dojt hesitate to try this place you will leave a happy person after you eat there!"}
{"text":"We found this place on a list of Top 10 burger places in Arizona, so of course we had incredibly high expectations. It was early afternoon on a weekday when my boyfriend and I stopped by, so it wasn't very busy. It must've been obvious that we were new to this establishment because the cashier (may have been the owner as well?) took the time to go over the menu with us, which was very nice, so we placed our order and took our seat to wait for our food. Immediately we noticed the decor was rather dated - almost like it had a hint of a 50's diner theme, but they didn't quite commit to it enough to complete the look, resulting in a bit of a drab style. Fortunately it wasn't too long of a wait, and the owner even brought our burgers and fries to us.

As for the food itself, it wasn't bad. I'm sad to say my expectations may have been too high, because while the food was decent it was still very average and possibly misplaced on that Top 10 list. The service was wonderful and we'll likely be back eventually since we live close by, but I've certainly had better burgers from places like Five Guys that also make their food fresh. Even the name, Giant Hamburgers - not even the biggest burgers I've had. As I said, not bad, just average."}
{"text":"Amazing service, genuine smiles and care! You can tell they are in it for the passion and not just for the money. Love love LOVE it here, will definitely be back. Oh, and the food was INCREDIBLE. you definitely get a bang for your buck!! Give this place a try, i promise you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cheeseburger! 
I stopped in this little unassuming diner in a strip mall in Mesa yesterday with a few coworkers. The place is tiny and we were lucky to grab one of the few booths they have. You place your order at the counter and then your food is delivered to your table. I had the cheeseburger and my coworker had the hamburger with fries. (We had to order what the place is named for.)
 It took a few minuets to get the food, but you can watch them cook it while you're waiting. 
The cheeseburger was divine. It had two slices of American cheese and any toppings you want. The bun was nice and soft and the veggies were fresh. 
I tried some of the fries and they were really good, nice and crispy. 
I am in this part of town every Sunday and I will be making this a regular lunch spot for sure! 
They also serve breakfast around the clock if you are in the mood for that...
If you plan on using a credit or debit card they will charge a $0.50 fee. Cash is the way to go here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The employees are super friendly. I am not a good cook and neither is my wife so we are always craving home style food. This place has it. The prices are fair and the food is defiantly worth the price."}
{"text":"Without the help of Yelpers we would have never found this place!  Everything made fresh...and to order.  The burger was great!  Wife's Gardenburger was the best she's had in a very long time.  She got jalapenos and they even had some kick (she thinks they were fresh).  

It's a bit of a drive from South Chandler, but worth it.  We will be going back again!  We both agree it is worth the drive out to Lindsey & Broadway for a really good burger that is not from yet another chain!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place we come here at least once a month. The burgers are done just right and don't come close to any nasty fast food meal. The is no doubt we will come to this place numerous times. If anything I have this place 5 out 5 because it's just amazing and down deep great food. I order the bacon burger which tasted so fresh and home made with a great kick of the best meat out there."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Prices. The gentleman that works the counter welcomed me back after only seeing me once before.  He seems to remember everyone and is a great host!  If the food isn't enough to bring you back, he will get you to come back!  Also, I recommend getting a milk shake to split as they are pretty big and just too good!"}
{"text":"Great hamburger, they truly are big and tasty. French fries big enough to share and the milk shakes are like homemade ice cream. Had the chocolate pie small size and it looked like a large size. Definitely worth the trip. Bring cash though. Extra charge for credit card."}
{"text":"Service is great and good large burgers. Definitely add green chiles to your burger.
Not a place you go to for the ambiance, but it will beat any fast food joint if it is a burger you are looking for."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since High School so let's just say the consistency has lasted well over a decade. Love this place and it's been the same staff for years. Get the double breakfast with Biscuits and Gravy.  So delicious."}
{"text":"We Love the burgers very yummy ..made right in front of you like a old school cafe. We love the very personal owner and staff and the place is always very clean."}
{"text":"Finally tried this little gem for a truly tasty  giant hamburger! Both of us decided on swiss cheeseburgers with grilled onions and mushrooms. Huge genuine homemade burger that was delicious! French fries were must as well! Maria and Oscar made our time spent here so enjoyable! We will most certainly return SOON!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at this place after I checked them out when they commented on a Twitter post of mine.  The food lived up to the hype and more. 

Will definitely be visiting again and totally recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I can't believe I lived in Mesa for 5 years and I just stumbled into this place now. So glad I did! Giant Hamburgers is better than any fast food or casual dining restaurant i.e. Chilli's, Applebee's, etc. The place is tiny with maybe seats to accomdate 30 or so people. It has the old school charm of a diner malt machine and all. Since it's locally owned it's staff is small, but friendly and attentive. Oscar owns that flattop grill like nobody else. The patties are juicy and cooked perfectly. I always get the sauteed onion and mushroom, swiss (sometimes bacon) added to my burger. So yum! My only complaint, which really isn't one, is the fact the burger and toppings are oozing with flavor that the bun, although buttered and grilled, gets soggy as you get halfway through eating. Nonetheless, it's perfection, but definitely not for the healthy eater. Their fries are so flavorful and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I have yet to try anything else, but I'm sure they make everything great. They even make pies for dessert! Obviously, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Burger was juicy, everything was fresh and well proportioned. Fries were cooked perfectly. Everything seemed reasonably priced given comparison to other similar type restaurants I've frequented. I do love good onion rings and wouldn't mind seeing that added to the menu. Also sometimes the \"special sauce\" is a good option for burgers (the thousand island type stuff) but I didn't see that on the menu. Each to their own. Customer service was courteous and attentive though I was not immediately aware I had to pick up my order and I was sitting at the bar for about 5 minutes while my burger and fries sat awaiting pick up.  I will have to come back to try a milkshake. Bottom line I'd eat here again. Will take half a star off for no onion rings but I can't so I'll rate them a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Giant hamburger has been my go to breakfast place for years. They have excellent service along with great food. I recommend the double breakfast, omelette, or the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Giant Burger's food is fantastic. The hamburgers are made with 100% beef and taste homemade. Their garden burger is made with a Boca patty that is grilled to heavenly perfection (you must try it with mushrooms yum!). Whichever burger you choose, it will be freaking huge. Their fries are cooked in canola oil and they are just the right amount of crispy. I had a chocolate shake which was big enough to share but I wouldn't dare share something so amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the hamburger buns. It's like they were steamed. After the bun touches a wet tomato and onion the bread becomes kind of soggy but still edible and delicious. I prefer a grilled bun so I will ask for a grilled bun the next time. Also their shakes are not very thick. However, the shakes do have an exquisite taste and the amount that you get for the price is awesome. Everything is reasonably priced! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My go to place for a cheeseburger. In the neighborhood, not far from home and I feel like I'm eating a homemade cheeseburger. They are HUGE and DELICIOUS. Also, make sure you don't leave without trying their homemade pies. I normally go for the French Silk or Apple Pie."}
{"text":"Was wanting a burger and thanks to yelp discovered Giant burger. The woman behind the register, who also cooks your food, is super friendly! The burgers are exactly what they say, GIANT. Packed with yummy deliciousness. Fries are yummy too. We were satisfied, would come back but it is out of our way. Hope we're in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Oh wow. I'm in from out of town and my mom, my cousin, and I came here for lunch. I had the chicken burger wrapped in lettuce, my cousin had the veggie burger, and my mom had the regular burger with an extra patty. All of us came out of there stuffed and more than satisfied. They have add-ons like green chiles, bacon, cheese, and mushrooms, etc. Not only was the food awesome, but the service was fantastic. Everybody was super nice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went in because another Yelper I follow recently left a great review. Excellent decision! I was a little put off at first by how small the place is but the cheeseburger I got was so tasty! Cooked perfectly and way juicier than what I expected. We came in around 1pm and the atmosphere was very laid back and chill. We really enjoyed sitting and talking while we waited for the food. Everyone working was very friendly too. A+ burger and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best burger I had in a long time! Nice people and had an old school diner feel! Will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Love this place. First if all, the guys are so very nice. Eager to please and flexible as possible with your order. The burger was excellent. Great balance of patty, bun and toppings. Fries were hot and crispy. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I drove 25 mins to this location after going to the Phoenix Zoo because of the reviews on Yelp. I would change the price from $ to $$. At 6.45 for a cheeseburger, I wouldnt consider that cheap. Fries were 2.25 and they were what I would consider medium size. The actual burger itself was pretty good. They have good sauces. Overall not bad, I was expecting more based on the reviews."}
{"text":"LOVE GIANT HAMBURGERS!!! You get a giant hamburger, diner style...you can get it without the bun (they call it the diet plate) if you are trying to limit your simple carbs.  The staff is friendly and fast.  They will cook it to your preference but it will always be hot and juicy!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since jr high!  Both the breakfast and lunch are amazing!  Burgers are juicy and fries are the best you can find!  Staff is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"Simple, yet amazing burgers. Unpretentious and thoroughly bullshit-free. If you want one of the best burgers you'll ever have the privilege - yes, privilege - of eating, Giant Hamburgers is the place to make that happen. Can't wait to go back and try a shake!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Hamburger I have ever eaten, I was looking forward to a giant hamburger, what I got was a substandard burger, it was a dried up burger with more lettuce and stuff, the fries were great, unfortunately to make up for a mistake on our drink order, they gave us 2 more orders of fries on top of the fries we already had with out \"Burger\". I could not judge the service as she was too busy talking to some teens that had dropped in and the cook.  I would not be back, Husband was so disappointed as well."}
{"text":"Burgers are GOOD, shakes are more ice cream than shake, spoon not a straw but good nonetheless. Fries are average. My wife says the pie and chicken sandwich are delicious. The location is outdated but ok, they charge to use a card so if you don't want to pay extra bring cash. 

The breakfast is pretty average nothing special really. But it's made in front of you like everything else here, so you know it's not microwaved."}
{"text":"I'm still full of this delicious old school edible greatness! An amazing staff with just enough snark to make it worth your while. Delicious burgers and shakes...the breakfast looks great as well (we ARE GOING BACK). Oh yea one more thing- APPLE PIE."}
{"text":"FAVORITE HAMBURGER EVER! Must go here. If you want a good, simple, home made, ma and pa burger this is the place to go. Affordable, and they serve brunch/breakfast. Will definitely be coming back! PLEASE go here!"}
{"text":"This was our first, but definitely not our last visit at this little hole in the wall burger place. The place is small, but clean. The woman that took our order was helpful and friendly. I had the Fiesta Burger and my hubby had the Bacon Cheese Burger both with fries. We both loved our burgers. Green chilies were fresh with lots of flavor. The bacon burger had really good bacon on it. Both had fresh lettuce and tomatoes, we order with no onion. Fries were perfectly crisp! Everything came out fast and hot. When we were done the man that cooked the burger Oscar asked how everything tasted. He was so nice and friendly. Oscar even gave my husband a nice hand shake and invited use to come back! It's the little things that keep people coming back and we will be back. The only negative was we were so stuffed we had no room left to try the milk shakes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!  I ordered the pastrami sandwich, and my husband and daughter ordered cheeseburgers with fries.  

Like some of the other reviewers, they hamburgers were not huge but they were much bigger than what you'd get elsewhere.  In fact, with fries, my daughter and husband could not finish both their burgers and fries.  

The only (almost) annoying thing was that I had asked for extra salt and the guy taking my order recommended that we add salt from the table cause he puts plenty of salt.  Well, he was right.  There was already plenty of salt, but I kind of think he should have just added extra salt.  Then I would have ended up with fries too salty, but the customer is always right, right?  lol

Pastrami was delicious.  I was not able to finish it.  Sadly, I was too full to try a piece of pie which a lady at the next table ranted and raved about.  The slices were modestly priced too!  

I will definitely head back.  I am trying to avoid fast food, and this place is a good substitute with fresh ingredients and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Loved it! There hamburgers are so good. One of my favorites. Also their staff is amazing very friendly and helpful. Good prices as well, I hate spending outrageous amounts on food and they are definitely budget friendly. I would definitely recommend them to anybody who wants a fantastic hamburger!"}
{"text":"Fiancé and I were on a hunt for a great burger place. I really wanted to taste the authentic, REAL beef in my burger. Considering I am 20 weeks expecting and my cravings are to be brought to meet it's full expectations, I went on a frenzy in hunting down the best burger joint on Yelp...and BAM, it's here.

Space is small, but it was cozy! We had a little trouble finding the location due to the display light being out of service. We almost gave up because we thought the place closed or was closed down. (We drove around the plaza being super suspicious). 

Like I said, I wanted to taste the authentic beef, which was served fresh, along with the lettuce, tomato. If we're in the area, we definitely don't want pass up on coming in."}
{"text":"First trip here, Aug 2015. 1:30pm. Ordered a hamburger with everything and an order of fries, no drink. Cost is roughly $10 per person for lunch. This is not a fast food restaurant, it's more like a classic diner serving a full breakfast menu opening at 6am.

The location is on Lindsay just south of Broadway. Easy access off Broadway and Lindsay. Limited nearby parking, lunchtime might mean you walk 60 feet to park. This restaurant is in the same building as Fry's and Subway.

After my lunch here I cannot understand why anyone would want to eat at Whataburger which sits about 200 feet straight north.

While I don't think mine lived up to the name 'giant hamburger' but it was very filling, the fries crunchy. The service is great. Inside the diner is small, maybe 20 feet wide 50 feet deep, booths, tables, and counter seats. It's a little cramped inside. The interior is dated but clean, maybe a little worn looking but clean.

Aproximate time from order to delivery was about 7 minutes. You order at the register and take a seat. The register is right in front of the grilltop, there is no signage. Menu hangs on the wall above the grille or take a paper one by the register. This place has no web site as of today.

All in all a great sandwich, good service, great value. I will be back especially because I go to Fry's just around the corner.

1/30/16: First time I actually dined-in. Got the hamburger, fries, drink ($10). Everything was great. It's almost too much food to eat in one siting. Service was great, the place was clean.
10/28/17: Been here many times now, but never had breakfast here. I still think this is one of the top five hamburgers in Mesa. You can't compare it to 5-Guys because its a totally different dining concept. But just in quality alone, it's near the top. I still think the place could use a good cleaning and updating the interior. I have never had a bad experience here. It makes me wonder why anyone would go to Whataburger which is only like 500 feet away with this diner so close and way way better. If you are a strict low-carb dieter, this is probably not a place to eat but they do offer a few menu items for you too."}
{"text":"Where have I been all my life?! I've always driven by this place and I had never stopped in... why? 

We were craving burgers on Sunday and this place popped up on my feed. I saw that it had great reviews and so we decided to try it out. 

The inside is small but there are plenty of booths and tables. There was nobody in line and so we were helped right away. 

We ordered two cheeseburgers and added mushrooms to both for an additional 90cents each. My friend had a bacon cheeseburger with all the toppings. (Lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, mustard) Oh and pickles on the side! We also ordered two small fries, one strawberry shake, and one medium drink. My total came out to be $35. 
 
We sat down and we were starving. The food took about 15 to 20 minutes to come out but we saw that they were making everything fresh!! The waiter then brought out our food and he made sure we had everything we needed. He was so nice. 

The food? IT WAS DELICIOUS. The burgers were so juicy, and yes they were GIANT. The french fries were so crunchy and hotttttttt. Mmmm everything tasted so good. 

The strawberry shake was the perfect way to end such a great meal. The shake was creamy and it even had pieces of strawberry, umm yum. 

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you ever want an old fashioned burger, this is the place to go. Nothing fancy, just old fashioned diner style joint. I'm going to have to try this place for breakfast next"}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers.  My friends thought I was joking when I asked if they wanted to meet up here one night.  Nobody could believe there was actually a place called Giant Hamburgers.

The food was pretty good.  The burgers were good, but they weren't anything terribly amazing.  The fries were awesome though, especially the chili cheese fries.  And the tiny bit of chocolate shake I tried was also excellent.

Just remember to bring cash - they don't take credit.  If all else fails, there's a Fry's right next door, so you can go over there and buy a pack of gum to get cash back."}
{"text":"Went here last night after months and months of just driving by and talking about going to Giant Hamburgers. A cool part is that you basically build your own burger with whatever you want on it. the waitress even hand-made thousand island for my husband. The burgers aren't huge but they are amazing and filling. I got a mushroom swiss burger and it had real hand cut mushrooms, not the canned crap you get elsewhere. The shakes are like a wendy's frosty, served with spoons, not straws. I would like real ice cream vs soft serve but it was still great and big enough for our family to share while we waited for the food to be ready. I don't know what people are talking about with the fries, they were great as well. We'll definitely be back. Just about $25 for 2 burgers, a (real beef, huge!) hotdog, shake, drink and fries. And we left FULL, like go to bed and fall asleep full. The only complaint I really have is about the air conditioning, it was FREEZING inside, I imagine in the summer that will not be a complaint anymore haha."}
{"text":"I got a cheese burger with green chile added. My burger was good but had some flaws. It had a little too much tomato and onions. I had three slices of tomato and a onion like at In and Out. I couldn't taste the green chile. I wasted 60 cents there. I think next time I'll ask for diced lettuce and onions with no tomatoes. I liked the fries. They were nice and crunchy. We had outstanding service. I felt the price was a little high. They rang us in at 19 dollars or so. With all that being said I'm probably go back and try a variation of what I ordered."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It isn't super close to our home, but when we are in that area, we would definitely go back again!!!! It certainly has a no-frills ambience, but I could care less after eating their burgers, fries and chocolate shake!!! We had a party of four people and every since one of absolutely loved Giant Burgers."}
{"text":"Very good burger & fries.  The meat is brought in fresh everyday, so I was told. Lady behind the counter sold me on a piece of peach pie. She said the fruit pies are made fresh daily. This place reminds me of an old school diner from back in the day. Think I will try the hash browns next visit. They looked really good and crisp."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp & I'm glad I did.
We are always looking for somewhere new to get a good hamburger. All 5 in my family really liked this place, the food & the service.
It's cute that the staff wear ties to make our burgers. We had 3 cheeseburgers, 2 hot dogs, chili fries, french fries & a grilled chx sandwich.
Portions were pretty big. The fries are super crispy. I appreciate that they sell small (1/6) of a pie slice & large (1/4) of a pie slice. We'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is great. The owner Doug is the best very friendly people. and the food is AAAA+++++"}
{"text":"They offer an awesome menu with good breakfasts and just like the name GIANT HAMBURGERS that are delicious. Love coming here."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely giant, well made, and extremely delicious. The best burger I've had in a long time!  Also the shakes are awesome and the fries are perfect! Seriously, you have to come here!"}
{"text":"Service was almost as good as the Food and the Burger was Awesome.  Had the Bacon Cheese Burger, and by the way the Fry's also Awesome.   Atmosphere was right out of Smallville USA, 1965, Nice Place with Good food, next trip, Chocolate milkshake with my Bacon Cheese Burger, hum - I think I'm getting a crave to return for Lunch today!"}
{"text":"Gross greasy slop. I will not be returning here. By the time I got my food the bun was soggy from the burger grease. Gross."}
{"text":"We'd wanted to try this place for a while. We went there for lunch and had a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. Everything is ala carte which makes it a little pricy (came to nearly $9). The burgers are OK, not bad, but not as big or as fantastic as I'd hoped. The fries were really good though...extra crispy. The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. We had our 9 month old and there weren't any high chairs that we could see, so it made it hard for us to eat (one had to hold her the whole time). Overall it was a nice place but not as great as I'd expected. We will try it for breakfast though sometime because the ratings on that seem to be pretty good."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place is amazing. My wife and I came here after hearing about it. We both ordered cheeseburgers with jalapeno and bacon and fries and we split a strawberry milkshake.

Everything tasted delicious and fresh. The fries were tasty and the burger did not taste frozen. The jalapeno was spicy and the bacon was crispy. The milkshake was made with real ice cream.

They were also super friendly and seemed to really enjoy serving us. 

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love it! Finally made it here! I have been seeing this place on Yelp and decided to eat here. The place is very very clean and tidy. It does remind you of a 50's diner. The service was awesome and spot on.
I had a single Burger with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and mustard, it was perfect almost too big, had to bring half home! Fries were hot, crunchy and crispy. Mom got breakfast and had the single plenty for her! She got an egg, lots of bacon, hash browns and toast with a selection of jellies. My husband got the Chili cheese fries, he liked them but felt the chili was salty. Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast some time. I will definitely recommend and go back. The pies looked awesome too but I was too FULL!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Old school diner feel with awesome food. They have the best fries and milk shakes all for reasonable prices. Their breakfast is awesome too. Friendly service goes a long way. It's definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"Awesome cute little resteraunte! Super friendly staff and one of the best french fries ive ever had"}
{"text":"First time here in Arizona, and wanted to get dinner so I stopped by Giant Hamburgers.  The service was awesome, Logan was friendly.  As far as the food goes, burger was Giant and delicious; I added an egg to it.  The fries are great too.  Definitely come back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I had a 'burger' girl friend of mine bring me in here a few months back because she swore to  me it was the \"best in town\". I was so skeptical. I was wrong. It is a great burger. It is big and it is very filling. I was initially turned off by the price but thankfully it keeps me from being in there all the time. Burger, fries and drink runs about $10. 
I have taken several friends in since, as well as my son. We all love it and all of us talk of 'when we get to go back'
This is a great place. It is worth it to stop in and try it. You will not be disappointed (just full)"}
{"text":"Was my first time here. Was close to close. The gentleman who was cooking had already started the nightly girl cleaning. 
They made my hamburger the way I lowered also made fresh fries.
Not many places would. Got to work took a bite it was very tasty and moist.
Definitely will be back. If only to try a piece of pie or cheesecake. They looked awesome."}
{"text":"Great small place with a great selection of food .The manager and staff are always willing to help .the bergers are large enough to share and they will cut your order in half.The price is reasonable.The lunch crowd shows up at 12 so get there early to get space to sit."}
{"text":"Oh man. I can't say enough praise about this place. What a great hidden gem! We got a burger, grilled ham and cheese, two orders of fries and two drinks and a slice of cheesecake for dessert. For two, it cost about 25 dollars! For the amount of food we got, I felt this was incredibly reasonable! The quality of the food was amazing. The burger was fresh and cooked to perfection. My grilled ham and cheese was so delicious and not overwhelmingly greasy. It's the perfect mom and pop place that's tucked to the side of Fry's. The service was great and the wait wasn't long at all. We went mid day during the week so I'm not sure of how long the wait is during peak hours. There was only one waitress working at the time we went. All in all, We will definitely be coming back and definitely recommending this place to friends!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. My burger had a gross amount of mayo that was dripping while my husband's had no mayo. The French toast was still soggy in the center like it wasn't done cooking. The French fries are pretty good. But I wouldn't return due to being overpriced."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Food was just average. Price for family of four was expensive.  $55 for 4 burgers, 2 cheese fries, four drinks, + tip"}
{"text":"Giant hamburger is by far the best burger place to get a burger and fries it puts all other places to shame good quality food I definitely recommend this place to any burger lover try it out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Saturday at 7pm, place is hopping. Nice and cozy. Always love this place. The new lady could smile more, but I understand hard days and only three people working. Got the cheese burger with bacon, jalapeño and grilled onions. Always tasty. Support the little guys and get over here."}
{"text":"The food was yummy! However, the burgers aren't \"Giant\", unfortunately. The service was great, there was a bit of a wait for the food, but they make it fresh. The fries were crisp and their chili cheese fries were yummy! We ordered green chili on our burger and it was disappointing, however being a New Mexican, they didn't have a fair shot. All in all we will return!"}
{"text":"A good burger with thick crisp bacon on a nicely grilled potato bun!!  Small town feel in the middle of Mesa."}
{"text":"After becoming something of a \"regular\" here, I feel my first review was a bit disingenuous. Put simply, this is my absolute favorite place to get a burger, ever. The entire staff is amazingly friendly, Oscar especially so (so much so I only really like going when he's on shift). 

Everything is made fresh, so it takes a bit of time, but the wait is well worth it. The fries are crispy and always come hot, and the burger is juicy and piled high with premium quality veggies. They use two slices of cheese, so everything comes out nice and gooey. I have trouble finishing even their single patty and fries.

They serve breakfast here as well, though nothing about the breakfast really stands out. Honestly, the cheeseburgers are where it's at, and you shouldn't bother with anything else (expect for maybe their homemade pies, which I'm always too full to try)!

My only complaint would be that the place is smallish, and pretty much always busy because so many people love this place. The bathroom is in the back of the building, and you have to walk through the kitchen storage to get there. The tables will fill up quickly as well, leading you to sometimes have to squeeze past other diners.

I have absolutely never had a bad experience here and don't suspect I ever will."}
{"text":"Excellent hamburgers made EXACTLY the way that you want. They also have great breakfasts.  Courteous and eager to please."}
{"text":"Have been here several times but always forget to leave a review, my wife & I enjoy coming here the people are great and very friendly and the hamburgers are one of my favorites with a big green chili added, have heard great things about there breakfast so will need to try them soon,"}
{"text":"We found this on yelp. Great burgers wonderful crispy fries. Fresh meat and all the fixings"}
{"text":"Crispy, delicious fries. Literal giant burgers with the perfect amount of cheese and all kinds of goodness loaded in between the buns. Added a chocolate milkshake to complete a state of classic food perfection. Visiting from PA, boyfriend bought a t-shirt, definitely would recommend.."}
{"text":"Not your ordinary burger joint! Super fresh ingredients you can taste the difference. I'm watching my carb consumption so they made it bun free, cheese free, and instead of fries I got a side of 2 egg whites. I know it sounds crazy, but it was so good, I'm having the same for dinner."}
{"text":"It was OK 
My husband enjoyed it :/ they ADDED WAY WAY TO MUCH MAYO!!!
The PRICE for 2 BACON CHEESE BURGER one with Avocado and 1 soda 1 water bottle and 1 order of fries wait for it!!........................
$22.00 NO WAY!!!!!WAY TO MUCH MONEY FOR THAT!! 
I believe they OVER CHARGED US (NO RECEIPT) the Lady didn't seem very friendly but the fry cook did 
Most likely I will NOT BE RETURNING!!!

Going to Macdonald's or In and Out is cheaper JIMINY CRICKETS"}
{"text":"I swung by this place for the fist time Saturday night. Had never heard of it but wanted something quick and tasty on my way to the park. I don't live in the same neighborhood so I'd really never seen or heard of it ever before. I rolled in there, had them make me a pastrami, swiss, Jalapeño burger and it was to die for! My girl got some pie as well that was good. I'll be back for sure and I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"If you want a great hamburger, go here.  They do hamburgers the way they should be done.  All the staff is great,  they bring you your food,  makes sure the food is right.  Great place for a \"time out\" from everything.  When you leave you will be full,  and feeling great, because the staff are just as amazing as the food.  Great breakfast as well!"}
{"text":"The burgers are GIANT and really good!  Love the service with a smile !  They also serve breakfast all day, which is a plus in my book...next time I stop there, I am having breakfast for lunch:-)"}
{"text":"This was our first trip and our 4year old said, \"Daddy can we come back here?\" To say its a winner would be an understatement! We enjoyed our very generous portioned burgers, nice crispy fries and Grape Fanta!!! The shakes were great too! The staff were helpful and personable."}
{"text":"We went another time and the lady wouldn't let us pay with a credit card even tho their sign said they take credit (and we paid that way before). This irritated my husband because it seemed like she wasn't listening. When our order came out wrong, it solidified it. We didn't have the order fixed because it seemed like a hassle.  We were tired and hungry after a very long day and weren't up to waiting. It was the evening if the heavy rains, so possibly that had something to do with it...?"}
{"text":"I have been to Giant many times and every time I try something different. Each and every time the food is great and the staff is very friendly always saying hi to everyone who walks through the door. So I wanted to say thank you to Doug and his staff for the great service and food I get every time I visit. 

Alan"}
{"text":"Trying new spots. ..just moved to area. Bright my sin to try guy place based on the reviews. Can't say if be eager to come back. Fries were hard and the burger tasted old,  wasn't hot. Sons burger was drenched in mayo."}
{"text":"The staff here is very welcoming and the food and prices are fantastic. I stumbled on this place because of their good reviews and I have a feeling I will become a regular because I just bought a house down the street. This place is easy to pass by because it doesn't have much curb appeal but trust me you want to stop in."}
{"text":"Take a look at the other diners' plates when you walk in, and you'll know you're in a good place. Do yourself a favor and order a burger. No ketchup, and it doesn't need it. Big portions. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Good quality and flavors. They even sell gourmet pies. This place opens at 6 am and has big breakfasts too. The north end of the parking lot is a little tricky, so be careful, and keep your eyes open."}
{"text":"We went for hamburgers at lunch time on a Sunday.  The place was packed.  Every seat taken.  You order at the counter and then find a table and it is a small place.  We sat at the counter with the kids and watched the food being prepared as we waited.  1/2 the people there were eating breakfast and it looked GOOD.  The sausage gravy poured all over hashbrowns looked so appealing to me.  Talk about a hangover breakfast!!

My veggie burger with american cheese, 2 kinds of mild chili peppers, sauteed mushrooms and all the fixings was fabulous.  All except the mushrooms which were canned.  Yuck!  I won't order mushrooms there again.

Everyone else had regular cheeseburgers and were satisfied.  

The french fries were so good.  We did not order milk shakes but will have to next time as they looks fantastic.

The price is very reasonable.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Oh My Burger!!!! So amazing  We had the GIANT Cheeseburger with GIANT Fries. Definitely coming back here.....maybe for their GIANT Breakfast"}
{"text":"Usually go for breakfast.  It is better than any you would get at any of the local chains.  The staff is very friendly and the service is good.  Each time I try something new, it is very good as well.  Try the chili/cheese fry's with onions, EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!
Love my Sunday breakfast at Dougies place!
Highly recommend Giant Hamburgers to everyone!!

Mike Ranahan"}
{"text":"Never had a bad burger here. When I'm in the mood for a home-style burger, this is my place. The quality of their ingredients is excellent and the staff is friendly and helpful. Try the shakes. They're fantastic!"}
{"text":"thanks fellow yelpers we went to breakfast this morning good food resonable prices i will have to try there burgers before i can give this place a higher rating"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews, but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday. My experience was very different. We went for a late breakfast. It's best if I summarize my plate. The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks, mixed in as they were. The hamburger patty was the driest, least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy, flat without any taste or salt. I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day. The service was nothing exceptional.  I thought the place would have some charm, but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner. It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else. Never again. It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing."}
{"text":"I've visited Giant Hamburgers twice in the past month.  Both times I've had a fantastic, tasty, juicy cheeseburger with the works and add two green chilies on top of it all.  The fries are the best I've had since moving to the Phoenix metro area.  Move beyond the strip mall appearance and have a great eating experience."}
{"text":"We will be back! Delicious food and great service! They even made a special pancake for my son because he just had his tonsils and adenoids out! Oh and the milk shakes are ridiculous! So impressed! Totally loving the diner feel!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there is nothing giant about these hamburgers... BUT that doesn't mean they didn't taste good. I just thought by the name of it, they would be significantly bigger than regular burgers. I give them props for using fresh veggies, however, the chili was way too salty. Fries were delicious. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very good burgers but service is just a bit slow. That's bcz they have only one cook so I don't blame them. Plus since every thing is cooked fresh, good quality food take more time."}
{"text":"We were in Mesa for an antique event and ready for lunch. We found Giant Hamburgers on Yelp with good reviews, plus we like local. For lunch we both had cheese burgers and fries....thank the you for hot, crispy lightly salted French fries and juicy, big hamburgers! Besides comfort food you gave us the best service. The employees were attentive, courteous and even brought me a knife to cut my hamburger in half. Hello, who does this anymore? As we left with smiles on our faces, the employees thanked us for coming. We will be back because your menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, how could I live in Mesa for well over a decade and not know Giants existed!  I absolutely LOVE their burgers and fries!!!    This place is worth trying out.  You'll probably get hooked and NEVER eat a fast food hamburger again.   Don't forget to try a slice of their HOMEMADE pies.   We had Lemon Meringue and Pecan, both were delicious"}
{"text":"Ran to Mesa from Florence because we had some things to do in the area and looked for a tasty place in the area to eat with the kids. Saw this place with the great reviews and decided to give it a try. We love small local places with character and sure enough that's what we got. We were greeted very nicely by a lady and gentleman and she reminds you of your grandma. Being that it was 130 on a Saturday I was expecting a crowd but there were still places to sit. 


The food was cooked fresh and the fries were fantastic. And when they say Giant Hamburgers they sure do mean it. My only complaint is the price as it was 50 dollars for 4 of us. But for a smaller place I know sometimes they have to charge more. Fun place if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the green chili's on the burger. Friendly people and quick. Reminiscent of the old diners"}
{"text":"Love this place for a morning breakfast trip. I always get the double plate. as well biscuits and gravy like grandma use to make."}
{"text":"This place has seriously bomb burgers. On top of that yes, their fries are just as tasty.  This little gem may not look impressive from the outside located in the middle of a strip off of Lindsay Rd by Broadway but inside is cozy with an old diner feel to it. 
I love to support local businesses, especially those ones with the same smiling faces behind the counter cooking and serving.  Don't miss this place if you're looking for a cheeseburger to hit the spot. 
Keep it up, Giant Hamburgers! You're definitely doing something right."}
{"text":"I have been a lucky patron to Giant Hamburger for nearly 10 years. It doesn't get any better. I have experimented with other burgers but they always dissapoint after experiencing this place. 

Probably the biggest competition for them right now is Five Guys. Five Guys is good. No doubt about that but Giant Hamburger easily beats them. 

Also, Giant Hamburger has delicious, flavorful and crispy fries that shadow most competitors.

I recommend getting a green chili on your burger. Just a thought. It isn't on the menu but they are happy to accomodate.

Speaking of accomodations. This isn't the most fancy place. It has 4 walls, about 10 booths but fancy is not the intent. This is a burger joint. The employees hardly ever turn-over. If ever. So they are all experienced and have great attitudes. 

Writing this made me hungry for another Giant Hamburger. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a second time this week. Today, tried out Giant Hamburgers breakfast menu. 

Ordered a high protein meal that included a juicy, rare hamburger patty, crisp bacon, fried egg over easy and juicy tomato slices.

Yup,  they nailed this breakfast perfectly! Great job guys. Thanks to owner, Marie for checking to see how my meal was. I plan on being back here again.

Hook'em!"}
{"text":"So, here's the deal... and I kind of feel bad for only two stars...
We went here for breakfast.  And the breakfast was okay.  It was... well... average.  I'm no cook- I'm a career girl.  But my breakfasts made at home KILL over what we got.  I was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.  It was a rare Sunday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we decided to monumentally Have Breakfast.  
I, of course, consulted my fellow Yelpers, who are generally the smartest, best, and brightest in the world... and having been to Giant Hamburgers for,well, a Giant Hamburger,years previously (which was FREAKING AMAZING) I thought that I could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.  Many Yelpers highly recommended G.H. for breakfast so HOW could we go wrong?  And off we went.
Between the two of us, we were able to sample a fair range of food.
Okay, so the toast was just cheap bread (think 2 loaves for $1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways) the eggs were very plain and bland... bacon was okayyyyy (and I love bacon with an unholy passion so it's rare that bacon doesn't blow my skirt up) but just cheap, thin cuts, not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.  I will say that I did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy, but I would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were pre-packaged generic, not fresh/hand-made.  
The staff there is truly nice, and I like the personal service.  Saying hello.  Eye contact.  Genuine niceness.  This was consistent with my experience there a few years back, and it hasn't changed.  This kind of services is worth BUCKETS of cred in my book.
What I *SEVERELY DISLIKED* was being the only english-speaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.  At one point, all the staff were speaking spanish, and after one older couple left, all of the diners were speaking spanish, and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of Guadalupe.  But without great food.  It was uncomfortable enough that we finished up, left some food behind, and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have. 
So, although I am a big fan of the Giant Hamburgers at Giant Hamburger... I just didn't feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did."}
{"text":"Best fries EVER!  Has that old diner feel including the kind employees. Haven't tried the homemade pies yet, but they look amazing."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Rob H. anyone giving this place a bad review lives in a negative world. I have been here dozens of times and I've never had a bad meal. The burgers are always fresh, never frozen and they are darn good. I love this place! It's my go to place when I'm craving a good burger. Oh and their chili cheese fries are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the diner feel! My son had a hamburger and it was huge. The kid who can eat anything was full 3/4 of the way through. But he finished his fries and proclaimed that this was another place he liked the fries at. I had a pastrami with Swiss on rye. It was yummy. The pastrami was heated on the well used flat top grill and had a slight crunch on the ends. Perfect. 

We came looking for pie for my son's class Thanksgiving Event. We left with a whole cherry pie and two slices to taste test, cherry and lemon meringue. They look great but we are both too full to test them now. 

The staff was very nice and attentive. As we were sitting at the counter watching them cook I listened to the staff call customers by name, and guests leaving were saying goodbye to them by name as well. I deem this a sign of a great establishment. Nothing says \"great neighborhood find\" like regulars that are treated like guests! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Everyone was friendly. All items in the menu were awesome. Yes, we tried all the items on the menu (including the pies). I wish I could take them with me back to San Diego."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I went out of my way to stop in, because according to Yelp, this is the best burger joint around. 
No. No it isn't. I got there at 2:30 in the afternoon. No one else was around, so it's just my order. I ordered two bacon cheeseburgers with fries and sides of ranch. The first thing that gave me pause was that they started the fries before the burger. So I knew the fries were going to sit around for a while, but whatever. 
Anyway, I get my food and reach into the bag to pull out a fry. I've still got a few miles before I will get home, so I figure I'll taste the fries while they are hot. Number one, fresh out of the bag that was just handed over, the fries were lukewarm. Number two, you know those nasty fries that look all nice and crispy and....fry like, that you bite into and discover it's all a big sham? Their fries are coated in some sort of preservative flavored powder that wants to be curly fry coating but isn't, and the inner fry is just a sad little impotent chunk of limp potato. 
That's ok, we've got ranch! 
No. No we don't. I don't know if dollar stores make house brand ranch, but if they did, this would be it. 
Ok. Fries and ranch are a wash. What about the burgers? Well, I gave the restaurant two stars because they are, in fact, giant. Giant slabs of what I can only imagine is meat flavored play-dough. The precooked bacon was put on the grill at the same time as the raw hamburger meat, so it was more like bacon bits by the time it hit the burger. The veggies were good. They basically put a small side salad on your burger AND they were good quality veggies, so there's that. 
TL;DR, if you are really hungry and don't care what your food actually tastes like, go for it. If you're like me and are just looking for a tasty burger and fries, do yourself a favor and skip this place. 
Side note: this restaurant wasn't so bad that I felt I had to leave a review to warn people away. I'm leaving this review because I don't think the 4.5 star average is anywhere near accurate. For what it's worth, the people there were really nice. It just wasn't a $25 lunch by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Very good cheeseburger with lots of veggies on it ($5.20) and a chocolate shake ($2.70) so thick that I had to eat it with a spoon. The burgers are very large. The food is 4.5 stars. They also serve breakfast. Be aware that their website does not list prices.

It looks like they only have one person working at a time, but the person on duty while I was there was very nice and made you feel right at home. Since everything is fixed from scratch it does take a little while for the food to come out. You pay at the counter and then the employee brings your food to your table when it is ready.

There are tables and booths, but they are very worn and the vinyl is coming off of the booth in spots and the table tops have very faded spots. There is some piece of equipment that is so loud that you cannot hear the background music/radio. So the physical setting is a little less 3 stars. Parking is adequate and close to the door. I would return for the tasty burger and shakes, but the physical set up is in dire need of a make over."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my!  I was in the mood for a hamburger today.  Doesn't help all those adds on TV about The Walburgers and we don't even have one here in town.  So I grabbed my phone pulled out the trusty old Yelp app and searched.  

Giant Hamburgers showed up with 4 1/2 stars.  We read the reviews and looked at the pictures and what can I say, that's all it took.  We jumped in the car and headed over straight away.  Boy am I glad.  It was delicious. I have to say if the burger was a slightly bigger more filling version of the famous In-N-Out.  I liked this better!   I ordered the cheeseburger with everything, fries and a small orange Fanta.  My husband ordered a double burger with grilled onions, mushrooms, jalapeños and cheese.  We both ate them so there wasn't a drop left.   The fries were nothing special but who cares when the burgers are this good.  

We wanted to try the pie but didn't.  Trying to watch what we eat after all the holiday eating.  They serve breakfast too and we plan to come back to try it next time.  We will be repeat customers it is delish!"}
{"text":"It was all right. Better than fast food chains. I was a little concerned with the cleanliness. The bacon was left out at room temperature for I have no idea how long. It was out before I came in, and it was still out when I left 15-20 minutes later. I'm not sure if it was being left on a refrigerated section of their grill (if that's even a possibility), or if they just leave their raw bacon out."}
{"text":"Breakfast served all-day.  Fresh ingredients, made to order, clean restaurant, and friendly staff. Excellent overall. Recently added avocado to the menu, so I had a bacon cheeseburger with avocado. It was awesome! The only recommendation I have would be that they season their burger with spices , even salt pepper and garlic would be a good start. Worth going and worth returning."}
{"text":"Located on the southwest corner of Broadway and Lindsey in Mesa, this little mom and pop diner is the perfect breakfast place.  Its SUPER cheap and quick and the people are always welcoming and friendly.  

My favorite is the \"giant breakfast\" with eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of meat and toast.  

I've had lunch here too, the burgers yes, are giant, and delicious."}
{"text":"Best hamburger around. be prepared to wait,as this is a small place. Worth the wait! Definitely a mom and pop place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh, fast, and delicious hamburgers . I love this little restaurant . Definitely has a diner vibe  with a little counter where you can sit and watch the chef prepare your food . They also serve breakfast along with chicken sandwiches , fish sandwiches , and hot dogs. My favorite are the homemade pies! I would recommend the chocolate and apple pie."}
{"text":"Service was bad. I went to the bathroom and OMG! I was concerned that the water in the sink in the kitchen area had been there for days. Went back out and ate what we had ordered and it was alright. Did seem Giant too me. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Are the burgers big - yes!  Are they juice and taste great - yes!  Lots of toppings - yes!  Are they better than most burgers in the valley - yes!  Do  they wrap them in a way to hold and bite into them without any goodies falling out - yes!  Is this one of the best burgers in our town - a big yes!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough great things about Giant Hamburgers.   I have been a regular at this joint for 15 plus years and in that time have never gotten a bad meal.  I have converted many friends to the Giant way!! The portions are large and the product is quality.  As for some reviewers who are upset over lack of kids meals or being charged to use your card...I say move on to your chain restaurants who cater to the \"kids eat free\" crowd.  I like that this is a locals place and that there are not 15 screaming kids every time I come in to spend my money for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love this kind of place. 
Unassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat.
The wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave.
The Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times) 
When brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from \"giant\" but a solid diner burger.
Fresh fries, nice hot, and crispy.
Hot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.

So hey buddy... whats up with two stars?
The burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)

Then I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it. 
Like greasy tears.

Perhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,, 
I wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me."}
{"text":"My wife was craving fries and a burger so we stumbled upon this place. It was... it was a diner that fulfilled it's purpose. The burgers were lacking in my opinion but the ppl behind the counter are super sweet and hospitable. I wouldn't say the burgers are the greatest due to lacking flavor but then the fries. Oh my the fries. I could order a few basket of those suckers they were that good. 

If I'm ever close by again I would most definitely order the fries, and maybe the pies. They looked good too"}
{"text":"Giant, no. Really good though. Fresh is the word I'd use for how it tasted. I agree with the reviews comparing it to In an Out. It's like that burger except 10 times better. The place is diner style, the people were very friendly. The menu is pretty big even though the burger is all I got."}
{"text":"Service-Friendly, slow, extra charge for debit card..........
Food-It was good, Very large hamburgers!
Restaurant-somewhat run down, mom and pop kind of place"}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients. The green chiles on the burger are magic! Fries were freshly made and crispy golden just like I like them. Shakes were very well done classic flavors. Definitely love this place."}
{"text":"Seriously the best hamburger Ive had in a long time. I came here 2x in one week it was ao good. Huge burgers. Good meat and buns. Fries and shake were perfect. Price is comparable to most hamburger joints like whataburger and five guys etc.
People working there have been very friendly and welcoming both times I went. 
The place is surface clean but as i sat there waiting for my food, i noticed the water stained ceiling tiles and dusty fans and lamps and stained walls. 
The owner really should put a little money and a little elbow grease into this place. If he did this place would look awesome and be nice to eat in.
But the food I had and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Extremely nice service, the food was pretty good, ordered a cheese burger with everything on it and chile cheese fries. The chile cheese fries were delicious! I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If you want a good juicy burger you have to try this place. It's worth the drive from Chandler for me!!  Great shakes, and breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast burrito and extremely friendly staff. I wasn't expecting it to be so good but I was thrilled and not disappointed at all. Thank you for your time and exceptional service. I look forward to returning here soon. Cheers."}
{"text":"Hamburger was really good. I had cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms. Fries are like anywhere else, they were the crunchy, thinner kind. Iced tea is really good, doesn't taste like water, ugh, I hate when that happens! They have pies, may have to try those sometime. I do love pie! Charging 50 cents to use my card is a real turn off. I mean, everyone uses a card these days."}
{"text":"Fuck this place and the owner!
Came to check this place out because of the reviews on yelp. My boyfriend was really excited to try this joint. We ended up spending like $30 on two burgers two order of fries one coke and a strawberry shake. I asked for the break down of our order to understand why it was so pricey. They pulled out a busted calculator, started adding numbers and said \"actually I should've charged you more\" and I was like okay.

I fill up my cup with soda the employee gave me and sit at our table. She then comes to give me my strawberry shake grabs my cup and says \"oh sweetie I'll grab you water\" I'm like okay. Pours out my soda and grabs me water ...
I was like WTF. I confront her about it she says oh I didn't charge you for soda and I'm like then why would you give me a cup?! And the bitch says it's the owners policy to do that, pleading she was just following orders. She could have easily just charged us for another soda, I mean seriously?! Did u not just see us pay $30 for two burger combos that we're whatever's. And then she says \"I don't need to deal with this for $10/hour\" but yet she sure does things in the owners bullshit way of handling the situation for $10/hr."}
{"text":"Giant Burger is a good+ hamburger.  I could never give it 5 stars, as it is a typical diner burger; but, for what it is, it is very good.

When I saw the cook slap the patty down, I automatically thought this was going to be a cheap, frozen, ground beef patty.  Wow, I was definitely wrong.  I asked for the burger to be cooked med-rare, and although quite thin, it came out as ordered.  The meat was definitely not frozen, I could sure taste the freshness of the meat with the fist bite.

Cheese options are limited (american / swiss).  Again, typical diner burger, just better quality. 

I recommend trying Giant Burger is you are in the mood for a standard, not fancy, high quality burger."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! We were wanting to eat somewhere with that small family feel for our mother's day breakfast and we got just that! The food was amazing! The staff was amazing! Doug came to our table and gave all three of us moms flowers and wished us a very happy mother's day! Not only did we eat there, but we left with milkshakes and a delicious pie! Thanks for making such a great mother's day morning for us!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal. The serving sizes were enormous, and the food was good, all for a pretty good price. Not the best burger we've ever had, but better than average. The diner was small, but clean, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and very good fries  Loved the chocolate shake.  We would absolutely come back when in the area.

We travel a lot and use Yelp to find great places as we go."}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for a hamburger, so I looked up burger places near us. We looked at the reviews and thought we would try it. You order at the counter and then they bring you the food. I can honesty say this is my new favorite place for a hamburger and will be bringing friends there. My husband wants to try breakfast next. Thank you for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Started coming here when we first moved to Arizona almost 3 years ago. It was just a small place we stumbled upon, but it did not disappoint. We still wander in here on occasion when we're craving a good breakfast. Oscar is always polite and happy to see us. The customer service is one thing that will keep us coming. Good food, awesome service, classic diner-feel."}
{"text":"Heard about this from the girl who read it in the east valley trib so wanted to try it out.

Now it's pretty hard to screw up a hamburger but this place is above average in terms of a good burger.  Everything is very fresh and I like the ample cheese applied w/o my asking - just a good 'ol American burger.

Staff very nice... interior very old school deco... kind of a dive but not dirty at all and wasn't an issue at all for us.

I've also heard rave reviews of their breakfasts so I'm going to make another trip back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast from giant hamburger, had the double, eggs were good , hash browns Krispy.

I would go back there again, and I will.."}
{"text":"Classic diner style meals, the burger was good, toasted bun, juicy burgers along with some bomb fries, what more could you ask for. Food was cheap and the pies were on point! Not bad for a small burger joint!"}
{"text":"Another happy visit to Giant Hamburgers on the books! We got to me the owner, Doug, this time. He seems like a really wonderful guy and after meeting him you can tell why every experience we have is great! I can't make a single negative remark about this place! This is mine and my boyfriend's favorite place to eat! The food is AMAZING, the employees will always put a smile on your face, and the atmosphere is laidback and a place to enjoy your food! I have to change my review every time I come because I always have something new and wonderful to say about them!"}
{"text":"Giant Hamburger has been a go-to place for years for my friends and family. I could almost swear that nothing has changed since I started going here, even the staff!
I typically like their omelette with cheese and some hash browns, toast, and a side of bacon. I can't begin to tell you how amazing their breakfast is!
Their cheeseburger is big and tasty and their French fries are thicker cut but deliciously crispy. All the way down to the self-serve soda fountain, it's perfect.
You could probably doc this place a star for cleanliness but their food is just too impressive to given 4 stars.
Giant Hamburger holds that special place in my heart for best breakfast and burgers in the valley!"}
{"text":"We went here today thinking this would be a good place because the reviews were so high. Absolutely not. We were all disappointed and now even more so because we all are throwing up including my 2 year old...."}
{"text":"This is the place I dreamed of opening when I still had delusions of grandeur of running a restaurant.  The counter, pie case, huge grill, and simple delicious menu.  It took me back to when i was working in a small cafe like within a millisecond of walking in the door with my wife.  We sat and spoke with Oscar (who was polite and great cook) and waited for our burgers.  Huge, juicy, and just a really good hamburger was exactly what we wanted with chili fries to match.  We'll be back, many times I'm sure as my hamburger critic kids will need to try them."}
{"text":"The service, food and decor are everything I hoped for. I felt like I was at a small east coast diner with my bacon cheeseburger with gooey cheese dripping off the sides, crispy hot french fries and huge chocolate shake."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to enjoy fresh burgers or breakfast! They staff is very friendly and they work very hard to make your order get to you as quick as possible. I enjoy this diner because it gives you that old school feel haha. Definitely will come again! Everyone should try their hamburgers and fries because it tastes so fresh! Definitely a must go to!"}
{"text":"Horribly rude service and phone mannerisms. I wont ever dine here."}
{"text":"My hubby came here first. And he told me about it. He said it was really good. And it was. I had a cheeseburger and fries. It was super fresh! And had such a good taste. I would recommend this place and I will most likely be eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"Charge 60 cents to use a credit card.
Really cute authentic restaurant, however Fawan was acting defensive and kinda rude when I asked simple questions. Honestly the food was alright it was the same stuff that you would buy the grocery store and put together for a big family picnic you just didn't have to put it together yourself.  I have the hamburger and the chili cheese fries and a strawberry sundae (because they don't have fudge)."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things about this little joint decided to stop in for lunch. Ordered the cheeseburger, fries n a beverage burgers were everything good, greasy, cheese consuming the meat, and unadulterated beef on a bun... (don't tell my cardiologist) portions were good sized ***not the tiny oh wish I had ordered the dbl it's so small I'll be hungry in 30 minutes burgers*** get what ya pay for too, generous fries endless refills on beverages. I love supporting local venues so this place is aces all the way around. Thanks for the great service n fantastic lunch. I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Food was awful not worth the price and there is nothing Giant about their food I rather go to mcdonalds.and they do not give receipts"}
{"text":"Easily among the best burgers I have had in a long while. Its a small hole in the wall place which is often the best kind. 

I got a cheese burger with bacon, sauteed onions, and mushrooms. IT WAS HUGE AND REALLY DAMN GOOD. Mother got the cheese burger with roasted peppers. She was happy. We split the chili cheese fries. Bueno! 

I'm glad mother was happy. When shes not, bad things happen. Terrible things..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ... Go to Smashburger! Women that work there are somewhat rude and impatient. Restaurant is FILTHY! floors, tables, etc are dirty and gross. Chairs have rips in them. 

Chocolate cream pie tasted like it was made from cool whip, not a chocolate pudding. Cheese on burger was that orange stuff that comes individually wrapped in plastic and has a shelf life of forever. Burger was nothing special. Fries were ok but not hot enough."}
{"text":"This is a hidden Gem. The food and service are dependable and always above average.  The total facility is always clean an the staff present a well groomed polite presence. They do have a $.60 fee for using plastic. It is family friendly seating can be limited depending on the time of day.  I assure that if you do have to wait the food will be its own reward."}
{"text":"Order the two egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns, in a cheese burger with mushrooms and an order of fries.
It started off the order by packing up to go even though we were sitting at a table and eating in. So they unpacked the meal but it onto plates and then brought it out of the table. The hamburger was good french fries were so-so. The breakfast was okay. We also ordered a chocolate shake which is very large, but the consistency of a Wendy's frosty. Overall I would say that the place was just ok."}
{"text":"Yes, Doug, my initial review was after the first time I had been at Giant Hamburger. I just tried it again today and I was just as pleased with the food the second time around. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't like the decor. But the second time around I liked the understated decor -- again it reminded me of those small burger joints along Route 66. On second thought I kind of like the retro decor, therefore I'm upgrading my rating. I rarely give five stars but this restaurant deserves it.

When I equated Giant Hamburger to the golden days of Route 66 I was speaking from experience. My dad used to drive my brother and I on that highway quite often for business. He knew just the right burger joints to stop at -- and boy were they good!. Over the years I forgot all about how wonderful those Route 66 cafes were until I stepped into Giant Burgers. Wow! It all came back to me!

I like those sweet middle aged ladies taking orders and making the food. They do a way better job than most bratty teenagers."}
{"text":"Great burger joint.  I got a cheeseburger with mushroom, swiss, and jalapeños and really liked it.  My boyfriend got a cheeseburger with regular cheese and jalapeños and liked it, but thought mine tasted a lot better.  The chili cheese fries had nacho cheese on them and were good too. It's set up like a diner, so it's nothing fancy.  Prices are good for the quality of the burger.  It's not expensive and I would say on the same level as In-n-Out in terms of quality and price, it just doesn't have a drive through.  The menu variety is what makes me like this place more than In-n-Out because they have hotdogs, pies, etc.... Also, the bathroom is basically in the back of the kitchen stockroom, so you get a tour of the kitchen and stockroom on your way there and it all looks pretty clean!"}
{"text":"Great friendly customer service! Good price for a delicious burger!!! Fries were okay....burger was amazing!!! Get grilled onions!! And ask for pickles"}
{"text":"As limply the best burger on the Eastside! Price is perfect and the burger is actually giant!"}
{"text":"Legit! Come hungry ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________"}
{"text":"Finding a true Burger paradise is difficult these days. I've driven by this place a few times, and last night finally decided to give it a try. It's a small classic diner, where the food is the star. I had the double cheeseburger with pickles, onion, lettuce and tomato. It was Divine!! The beef was fresh, well cooked and flavorful. The bun was buttered and toasted... Was so good!  The fries were great too. 

Oscar, our burger chef, was great. I can't wait to pay him another visit."}
{"text":"This place was pretty bad. The hamburger was dry, the french fries were the kind you get from the freezer in the grocery store, and the deco is outdated to the point it looks dingy and dirty. I am all for retro, but this is not the look they were going for. The milkshake was OK, but overpriced. We have plenty of better options for burgers out there, so I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It's simple breakfast food at a reasonable price!   Just went and got the double that I shared with my son because it's a lot if food and my husband ordered the triple!  Triple everything, eggs, meat, potatoes! Our whole meal with two coffees was $19.60! You can't beat that!  We have never had lunch but I'm Sure it's tasty as well!!! There is one worker that has been there for years (I assume he's the manager) and he is super friendly and always accommodating! The service is superior and the place is clean and very friendly! Go now what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Just went there again, another bacon cheeseburger, but this time I had an egg on top of it, over medium. This place really is the best, if someone wants a burger, or amazing fries, THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Well done Giant Burgers...well done!!!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, I mean best burgers around. The staff are really nice and friendly. I haven't tried anything here I don't love. Food is fresh and authentic stuff. Delicious pies too.
But the place can get over packed during breakfast rush or even during lunch time. The place is small and a bit divey but we always gravitate towards it when thinking burgers. Lol"}
{"text":"I made the mistake(??) of coming here two weeks in a row, I couldn't get enough of the food, and I paid the price in terms of the scale.

Now, back down from the few pounds I gained, I realize I need to enjoy this place in moderation. Oscar and Doug are the serious assets to this place, I am not sure if one of them is an owner, but they are both extremely welcoming and conversational. The place itself is on the small side, but they never seem to get swamped at any time so there is plenty of seating.

Onto the food, the hamburgers themselves are just as other people have pretty much described them: good backyard bbq quality. You get a pretty decent sized patty, the seasoning is light but adequate, they seem to want the meat to speak for itself. The combination of the two very thick slices of cheddar, extra thick/creamy mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, meat and toasted bun is one word: fatty heaven.

The hamburgers are served with seasoned fries, and they serve pies! There was no way I was having pie after that meal I ate, but I may try some next time. They do have delicious healthy options like chicken/Boca/Gardenburger/grilled fish sandwich. My only suggestions are to offer a fried fish sandwich and perhaps, a more true milkshake. Otherwise, this place is definitely on my list of consistent places, like Haji Baba's for example!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I have ever had hand's down. They are so fresh and you can customize them to your liking. The man who makes the burgers is the sweetest and kindest guy! It makes me very happy to support a local joint especially when customer service exceeds my expectations!"}
{"text":"Doug,

Yes this was out first visit but it will not be our last.

Matter of fact, now that it's on my brain i think we will go tonight for a burger and a milkshake.

Thanks for responding, 

Samantha"}
{"text":"All I can say is, Amazing!!!  I could definitely say that it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Unfortunately, not the ultimate best, but close. Everything tastes fresh and juicy. The staff was extra friendly and hospitable. I would definitely come here again.

Food= 4 Stars

Service = 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Really good food here! got a double mushroom swiss burger with avacado and everything and the cook came out to tell me how massive it was and to use both hands! awesome! thanks Giant Hamburger."}
{"text":"I have been going here since the 7th grade and now I'm in my late 20's. I remember seeing the commercial on TV when I was a kid with the trucker saying \"It's the best darn hamburger, I ever had\".  

The quality of this place has gone down hill since then. It's needs to be renovated.

Paint job. New Countops, New Chairs, New Tables, and definitely needs a deep clean. Floor is dirty, where the food is prepped looks dirty, and ceiling pannels have stains.

Another suggestion, mount a TV on the wall so customers who go in to eat alone have some entertainment while waiting or eating their food.

The prices your paying for their food isn't well worth the quality of what they serve.

Overall, owner needs to update Giant Hamburger and get this placed cleaned up. 

This place is filthy. View the pictures."}
{"text":"No frills. Really tasty. Scratches that Diner experience itch. 4+ Stars for on-target Diner expectations. Would have gone 5 Stars, but the lady at the grill kind of emanated attitude and a general displeasure with being there. The lady who took our order, however, was wonderful. So, just slight room for improvement on the customer service side.

Sunday 8:30 am... Darcie and I went for breakfast. I was shamefully and irresponsibly hungry. I got an order of Biscuits and Gravy, Hash Browns, and a Bacon Cheeseburger. I know, yikes. But it sure hit the spot. Both spots! The Breakfast spot and and the non-Breakfast spot. I felt a bit less guilty when Darcie got the BCB as well. Prices are reasonable, the tastiness is stratospheric. For the record, half my burger went home with me.

As has been mentioned by others. GH is petite. Arriving during peak times will require patience through the wait to be seated. Word to the wise: Sunday mornings before 9:15 are a sweet spot for seating.

So stop in and get your fix, soak up some all-biddness Diner atmosphere and Deliciousness.

Oh, and dear lordy, I have to try some pie next time. They look amazing. 

Thanks for being there Giant Hamburgers. Love ya!"}
{"text":"Solid biscuits and gravy. Respectable chili recipe. Very fast service and a casual, almost retro ambiance. An enjoyable experience overall and a pleasant respite from chains and the pace of modern life."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for a burger! Found it when i was in Mesa and starving and hace been back every time im out that way. Has thay old diner feel and i always stuff up on the burger and forget to leave room for pie!"}
{"text":"The omelets are by far the best. The Hamburgers are Giant!
Have the best fries.
Friendly Staff."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Huge. Fresh crunchy onions on the burger. Thick American cheese. Great fries. Good old fashioned grill and the cook wears a tie. Clean cut people working here. It's our new burger place. Can't wait to try breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my husband's favorite places when we come into town.  The burgers are delicious. My husband loved the vanilla shake and the fried were great too. We had chocolate cream and coconut pies which were both delicious. I liked going back and forth and taking bites from each. The people are friendly and helpful. A great, solid, hole-in-the wall joint."}
{"text":"The hamburger was made fresh right as I got there. The cook (maybe the owner, not sure) was so nice. He is the reason why I am giving this place a good rating. I came in 30min till closing and he was still very happy to cook and serve me. I was grateful for that since I just finished a long day of work and driving. The burger was big and very filling. I just wish I would have tried the fries. Next time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the folks working here are some of the most attentive and friendly people you will come across in Arizona. Also, the milkshakes here are dynamite, but as the name of this restaurant suggests, it's all about the burgers. This is where the experience was quite...normal. 

The burger was cooked properly but had little flavor. I ordered a Giant Cheeseburger with bacon, grilled onions, and grilled green chiles. The bun broke apart as it absorbed all the moisture from the condiments of the sandwich. The bacon was pretty good, but the chiles and onions were not quite grilled correctly which was disappointing. I also ordered fries and these were average as well. Despite this, the customer service here is so awesome that you just CAN'T have a bad experience. This place is certainly worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have the pleasure of saying that I've eaten here within the first six months of opening and have continued to visit over the years. Although I've moved to another part of the valley, I'm sure to stop in whenever I am in the area. The breakfast, burgers and fries are all to-die-for. I can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's like an old fashioned diner with counter service.  The waitress Fawna is always ready with a quick come back and the food is just plain good!"}
{"text":"Wow. A really classic hamburger. Truly honours the 50's burger. Kinda dinner lunch bar feel to it. Try it! It is excellent."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Marie helped myself and my husband pick out some pies and made our first experience here great. Thank you Marie for making us want to come back again just based on your customer service."}
{"text":"The food has always been great the few times I have been here. The staff has always been friendly and helpful as well. Although I can say I would agree with some of the other reviews that the restaurant itself is not always the cleanliest."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger is mouthwatering! Service and place is commendable. All the time, energy and money is all worth it."}
{"text":"Lots of hype. Nice owners. I had the stake burger, was probably the wrong choice at a burger place. I would give this place a second change for this reason only. 

In the meantime, don't order the steak. It's tough, chewy, and leaves much to be desired by taste."}
{"text":"1st time at giant 1/9/15 
Bacon cheeseburger, fries and coke.
It was the standard burger you eat in your neighbors yard at a bbq.
No more....no less. The fries were standard variety frozen.
It was ok.
Is it in the realm of 5 guys ? Not even close, but their prices are close.
2 burgers, fries, cokes- 21.50 + .60 Credit card charge
5 guys( rip off price) - 25.00

Sorry folks....for my hard earned dollars, In n out burger and freddies steakburgers
Are the winners in taste, value and price.
5 guys is awesome but a royal rip off."}
{"text":"The food and service is really good here. The ladies here are alway friendly.  They keep a smile on their faces and will hold a good conversation with you. My burger was good but I kinda recall them being slightly bigger. 
The gripe I have and the reason for 3 stars is, the ladies need to use a cleaner technique around food. I watched one wear the same pair of gloves to take my order, ring me up and turned around and cooked with those same pair of gloves on. Top that, with these same gloves helped make 2 more orders. After paying I sat down to wait for my to-go order and noticed there was a tray full of trash sitting next to this open container of butter. About 10 minutes later one of the staff walks by the items and without washing her hands or gloving up, picks up the tray of dirty items than see the butter dripping so she scoops it back into the container with a finger and proceed with making an over the counter drink. I was amazed at how comfortable these ladies were with these unsafe food handling practices. While I like this place I can't say I'll be back anytime soon! Yes I could have said something but took my food home and just prayed over it! Hey it builds character . 
I have to suggest maybe getting the square system (or something equivalent) as I was made to feel a bit uncomfortable about the process the staff use when ringing up an order. My order was rang up 3 times and not one of those time could I see what I was charged for. An itemized receipt gives customer piece of mind! Next, it would be helpful to the ladies to re-take the food handlers testing just a refresher! Being really kind or sweet is great and all but when you have person get sick from improper food handling...that's no joke! 
Hope you all get it together soon!"}
{"text":"I liked this place... because it's a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their \"5 to try\" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think it's funnier that I have been in \"Hall of Fame\", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance. 

You walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 15 tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes you're in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us. 

On the way out, we noticed the \"Yelp\" sticker on the door. Bonus points."}
{"text":"Went there for their burger and overall it was OK not Great there was not much flavor to the burger. You definitely get your money's worth on the size but quality was not worth it. 

The place is an old style diner with open kitchen to the dinning area. As previously stated a bit run down but that's not a big deal service is a bit slow only a few people working at a time and it will get packed. Give it a try you may like it I would prefer the What a Whataburger next door."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food, I'm glad I tried this place today. 
OPEN FOR BREAKFAST with a proper breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hamburger places in the valley! Oscar was so helpful with what we should order and was genuinely happy to be there helping us. The french fries were superb as well. Go check them out and satisfy your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place was voted Best of Mesa 2015! It's obviously a local and visitor favorite. It's located in a strip mall, and not very appealing on the outside, but the inside is cozy. There is counter seating and plenty of tables for dining inside. You stand in line, place your order at the register and they'll bring it out to you. As you are standing in line you see the case that holds the pies. Yummy!! Several different types to choose from. I ordered the cheeseburger. It comes with mustard, mayo, lettuce, onions, tomato and pickle. I ordered mine without mayo but added ketchup. I had american cheese. They asked about fries, but after seeing the size of the burger, I said no to the fries. We found a seat, and a few minutes later our burgers were brought out. As I took the first bite, I could tell that it is fresh(not frozen) ground beef. And REAL cheese. Gooey and oh so good! They butter the buns then toast them on the grill, which enhances the flavor of the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly. 
The service here is topnotch, and we certainly did not leave disappointed. 
There is an extra charge to use a debit/credit card, FYI.
Next time we visit here I might just order the fries, one of their famous shakes and a piece of pie, because you can guarantee we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my Mother in Law while on this side of town helping her run some errands. She asked for lunch and I looked at my Yelp app. Giant Hamburgers had good reviews and a cool name. I wasn't disappointed.

She had a hamburger and I had a cheeseburger. We both had fries and a drink. Our hamburgers were both fresh and piled with generous amounts of fresh tomato, onion, and crisp lettuce. The were very good and not at all greasy. The piles of tomato, lettuce, and onion reminded me of a country diner in the mid-west.

The place was busy but the service was quick. Many of the customers appeared to be regulars as the owner/lead greeted them by name. The folks behind the counter wore white shirts and ties and the whole place was very clean. Giant Hamburgers feels inside like a diner and the owner/lead was very attentive. When we sat at a table that had not been wiped (they were busy at lunch time) he came out from behind the counter between orders, noted our table had not been wiped, and wiped it down for us. While we were there he took orders, delivered food, bussed tables, and wiped tables.

The burgers may not have been creative but the ingredients were fresh and the food was good. Burgers came with catsup, mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce, and tomato. You could add bacon or peppers (we didn't) and the cheese was american cheese. The fries had some sort of breading that was not my favorite, but my mother in law really enjoyed. To be honest, the burger was so big that next time I'd skip the fries regardless. 

Giant Hamburgers stood out for fresh food, generous portions, and an awesome staff."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff ever! Best burgers and breakfast in AZ. yeah I know that's a bold statement!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Similar to Whataburger but better and I can't wait to go back and try their fries.  I was cheap the first time and just got the burger."}
{"text":"This place is like a top notch fast food burger joint. Pretty dang good burgers!

My sister and I ordered 2 cheese burgers , 1 order of chili cheese fries, 1 order of regular fries and 2 cokes ($25 without tip). Their burger was so delicious, you can taste how fresh and good quality their meat is. Their veggies like tomatoes and lettuce in the burger were also fresh. Their regular fries were perfect and crunchy. We didn't like their chili cheese fries that much but eh. 

The service was good, we both highly recommend this place the next time you're craving a big burger with fries."}
{"text":"Love it! I work near Giant and it's great to go for lunch. Ask for santa fe chili's to go with your burgers. Chocolate shake is good too and the employees are totally friendly. :)"}
{"text":"The service here is great and the workers are all very friendly. I got a burger with green chile. It was incredibly delicious and fresh but could use some more seasoning. I also had the chili fries which were not as good and the cheese was just a couple squares of Kraft American singles. Overall the food was really good and I will be back to try out their breakfast food. Also the burger was decently priced. It was definitely better than in n out!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The hamburgers are pretty big lol. Customer service is great. Their hamburgers are made in front of you sort of like at Waffle House. They are fresh and yummy. I almost couldn't finish mine because of how big they are but I couldn't let it go to waste haha. I
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Cool spot, great big (GIANT) burgers which are freshly made and delicious.  The giant fries are really good as well.  Give this out of the way spot a try!"}
{"text":"Well the burgers were big that's a given. But there was absolutely no taste or flavor at all. Everything on the burger all tasted the same and so did the fries. Prices were high and no combos. Two burgers and one fries and a drink $17. Nothing like Toms Burger in Cali."}
{"text":"Ok. This is by far the tastiest burger we ha e had on a while.  Don't let the decor fool you.  One rely good burger and fries. ."}
{"text":"A delicious burger spot. I got the double bacon cheeseburger and added sliced green chilies and grilled onions to it. The fries are fresh and crispy like beer battered fries. The staff was very friendly as well as accommodating, greeting  me when I walked in and goodbye when I left. I had one problem which was my fault, I added too much to my burger and it started to fall apart. The bun could not withstand all the meaty and vegetable goodness. Next time I'm going to get the same thing but with a single patty"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I came here for lunch with my husband and we were greeted by a few really friendly ladies. We waited in a short line and ordered two cheeseburgers, one with green chilis and one with jalapeño, plus a French fry, and two sodas. The total was about $21. We sat down and waited for our food, which came out after a reasonable amount of time. The burgers were excellent! They were very large, flavorful, and juicy. The topping-to-burger ratio was excellent, as was the cheese. The fries were well cooked and were more on the crispy side, so my husband was thrilled. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today. Service was outstanding. Ladies were full of smiles, great at verifying our order, bringing the food out, etc. The burgers were good too but there are a few other places I think I would choose to go if that is what I craved. Kind of a turnoff that they charge $.60 extra if you use your card because they already charge a decent amount for the burgers. Overall a 4 rating from me mainly due to the service."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't look like much from the street. It's situated in a strip mall with other nondescript stores around it and a plain blue sign that says simply GIANT HAMBURGERS. But after reading the reviews on here I knew we had to give it a try. So far we have only been there once but it was delicious. I know I want to go back just given how yummy the pies looked alone. I enjoyed my burger and the plate of chili fries my husband got were enough to satisfy us both and then some - we couldn't finish it. I'm happy this place is so close by for us to go and give their other options (including breakfast) a try sometime.

When I went I paid with a debit card and accidentally did the math wrong on the total plus tip. A really nice man (I'd assume he was the owner) came over to figure out what I'd meant to put down and hew was so nice! Definitely great service here."}
{"text":"Yum.  Just plain yummy.  Love the old 50's atmosphere.  White shirt and ties, reminds me of an old dime store restaurant .   Crispy fries, great burger.  Toasted bun, just plain good."}
{"text":"The name is misleading its small to average size meat patties with a bland burnt flavor it wasn't worth the $10"}
{"text":"Real Deal Old School!!!! Great Food, old time caring service.Very Nice staff."}

My girlfriend and I just moved her out here from San Diego and were craving a burger. Yelp led us to Giant Hamburgers, a charming old school place with polite service and incredible burgers. 

We told the owner that we were from out of town and he greeted us very politely and gave a solid rundown of the menu. We both ordered a standard cheeseburger as this is our normal first order at a new burger place to gauge the quality against other places. We also got the fries and banana cream pie. The gentleman who cooked the burgers also personally brought them out and instructed us how to eat them without having them fall apart, a very charming touch! 

The burgers were incredible, the meat patty on this thing really tasted fresh which helped marry the whole thing together. They put a nice slice of american cheese on top that is reminiscent of in n out (delish). The tomatoes particularly stood out to me too, I'm not sure where they source them from, but man were they sweet. The bun was very fresh which also cannot be underscored. The fries were golden brown and super crispy, definitely didn't expect the fries to be this good at an old school burger place, but wow these guys got it down. 

The grand finale was the banana cream pie. I love when a diner type place does a great banana cream and this did not disappoint. The cream was very fresh and the crust was nice and flakey. This was definitely grandmas recipe. Some of the best BCP I've ever had. 

Great job Giant Hamburgers. The gentlemen working the front today (chef and manager) were super warm and friendly which made our experience THAT much more enjoyable. This was better than any burger I've had in California and I can't wait to bring my family and friends from out of town here."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a coworker.  Took me a few years to be in the area, and try it out.  The place is quaint, friendly staff.  Almost everyone there was eating breakfast at 4pm on a sunday, but I was there for a burger.

Little strong on the mayo, but otherwise it was quite tasty.  I think the key to a good burger is not overthinking it, with fancy this or that.  slap a piece of american cheese on it, some lettuce/tomato/onions for crispness and you are in good shape.  I added some green chilis to mine.  

I won't be traveling from tempe all the way out here, but if I am in the area, I will definitely stop by if I'm in the mood for a burger.  Very friendly staff is always a plus too."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for grabbing giant hamburger at 9am!!!! When they charge for extra bacon? They give you a pile of bacon!!!!! Good solid hamburger that was indeed large like the name states. Kind of a no frills come and get your big burger from really nice people from behind the counter place. Sure they serve breakfast too, but I love that they'll let you skip breakfast and burger it up in the am!!!!!"}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers makes me nostalgic for small diners in NY.  The food is good and the people are super nice.  I ordered the single breakfast with burger meat which was decent.  Food isn't greasy like Waffle House which was nice. I did have the pleasure of having a bite of the cheeseburger - it was quite tasty.  Overall I'd say that the food is decent borderline good."}
{"text":"Rolled in with like less than 20 min to close and the staff here is getting me taken care of! Two hamburgers fries and a shake! Three in some chili cheese for good measure! Look forward to munching on this as soon as I get home! Smells great!"}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic! Thick, juicy, loaded with toppings, and it just melts in your mouth. The fries were also amazing, almost more of a seasoning on them besides straight salt. I can definitely see this being a good hangover joint or when you get those late night munchies. Give it a try, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing hamburgers!  Pretty sure the owner was working when we went and he gave the kind of genuine service that makes you instantly want to go back to a place without even eating the food.  Really want to try there breakfast."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here. Great tasting and good sized hamburgers! Were trying the pie today instead of French fries. Fun to have a piece of pie with lunch :)"}
{"text":"Going in this place had a five. The look reminds me of the kind of hamburger joint I grew up fequenting. 
 My wife and I each ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries. The fries were on point! Golden crispy yet fluffy and tender inside. Perfectly salted and served with little cups of ketchup. The burgers were of generous size. The bun was tender and yet held together remarkably and mysteriously well for a burger that size. The toppings were very nice. Veggies were really fresh and had a nice crunch. The bacon was thick sliced and cooked to a perfect crispy perfection. Even the cheese was excellent quality and very tasty.  The patty was well formed and of a size that covered the bun.  However it was extremely overcooked. It was dry and nearly flavorless. It took three cups of the really excellent coffee to finish my burger. 
I will be back however as the overcooked burger was the only issue I had with this wonderful little place. Im hoping it was a one time problem."}
{"text":"Great PIE - I know it's a hamburger place - granted their burgers are awesome, but the pie is AMAZING! :) Grilled cheese is great... just like home. Good old fashion diner."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for YEARS and I couldn't think of a better burger place!  Anytime I'm craving a fresh yummy burger, chocolate malt and frys, this is my go to!!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this a 4.5 if it was possible. Love the old school feel. Nothing fancy just good food. There's an employee by the name of Oscar whom caught my attention. Everyone was really nice but Oscar was working hard, happy and pleasant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a burger!"}
{"text":"Simple and Perfect. If your looking for a good burger like you use to have at cook outs or at home this is the spot. Pure beef, nice and tasty and simple. No fancy pants addons or spreads. My cheese burger with bacon, jalapenos, tomatoes and onions was perfect. Just what I wanted. Top it off with some very crispy and delicious fries and a REAL Strawberry shake and I was in heaven. 
We took home large slices or Lemon Meringue and Coconut Creme pies. Very good, though to be honest I only ate a few bits because I was still full 5 hours later.
You can't go wrong ordering anything here."}
{"text":"Not only really good burgers but also great breakfasts, especially their pancakes! Very nice staff and good service. Homey little place, reminds me of my favorite diner in college. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go out for a good burger for my husband but also offered more. Got the chili cheese fries, cheeseburger, and grilled chicken sandwich. All very good!

Prices are very reasonable for the simple, but quality food. I'm always trying to find hole-in-the-wall places and I'm definitely adding this place to the list!"}
{"text":"I just love this 'lil burger joint. My diet doesn't allow me such greasy-goodies so I only go maybe twice a year...bu I always look forward to it. My wife and kid were away and I happened to be driving by so I popped in for a double burger. Their burgers are fantastic (my wife likes the home made pies) Anyhow, sat at the counter and had great conversation with the counter cooks...great guys; great friendly service. I asked why the burgers were so good asking if was the seasoned grill and he said the key was they use fresh unfrozen meat and just salt and pepper. Simplicity that tastes it's finest."}
{"text":"Fee Fi Fo Fum
I smell burgers, fries and then some!

With a name like Giant Hamburgers, I knew I had to try this place out! I had a giant sized appetite (Jack and beanstalks were nowhere to be found though) when we walked into this restaurant. It has a diner feel in here, with booths and tables, main counter with grill visible to the customers, and a bit of a faded look to the decor. I definitely wanted something with hamburger in it but also wanted breakfast so I thought that getting a cheeseburger omelet would be perfect. I also added green chile because why not? I also shared some chili cheese fries. 

The omelet had multiple layers of thin crepe-like egg, folded in a neat rectangular package holding the filling ingredients. It was a bit greasy but hey it's a hamburger place I wasn't expecting a salad. The egg, despite being cooked in very thin layers, was very nicely cooked, having a soft light consistency. The hamburger meat and cheese in contrast, was very dense and heavy. In hindsight I think an extra added hit of texture in the filling (Maybe some chopped onion?) would have broken up some of the similar soft filling ingredients since the green chile also had a similar texture. After a while I had to stop eating the omelet primarily due to the cheese. It had a gummy cloying consistency and overly processed taste that I couldn't handle. I didn't care for the chili cheese fries which were too salty for my tastes, in addition to having the same squares of processed melted cheese on top. 

I have no doubt that the hamburger patties are fresh and good quality, and I thought it was cool that an all female crew was working here when I went. I do wish that some of the other ingredients matched the quality of the beef though, especially for the price we paid."}
{"text":"I came here last night February 25th for the first time. I heard great things about it. I ordered a double bacon cheese burger with a green chili and onion and lettuce. I ordered a side of fries and a piece of pecan pie for dessert.  

I ordered mine to go and brought it home. The burger was awesome. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was fresh Patties. I could not put that burger down to save my life. 

. The fries were not overcooked, but we're done enough. Also good. 

. The Pecan Pie was a nice touch.

I will surely be a repeat customer, having this place as a go-to favorite option of choice. Exceeded my expectations. 

And I'll be honest, I was not expecting much as I was taking a visual scan of the decor and  interior, but the food and service made up for it."}
{"text":"I had driven past Giant Hamburgers for years until one day my dad suggested we try it out. And I'm SO glad we did. It's become our go-to hamburger place. You can order your burger however you like it (bacon, cheese and mayo for me)... and their fries are some of the best in town. Nice and crispy!

And like other people have mentioned, the grilled cheese is quite excellent as well.

I don't know if I'd call the hamburgers \"giant\"... but I've NEVER left this restaurant hungry. Ever. And I make sure I always come in with a hearty appetite. 

Never had breakfast or pie here... but they have both. Maybe next time I'll try out some pie."}
{"text":"They are good hamburgers, nothing amazing, but still pretty good. Had a really cool diner feel to it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  love their chile fries.  i get tired of the large franchise chains and it is nice to eat at local establishment.  if you are ever passing by lindsey and broadway stop in and try it out you wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! very small place but great family atmosphere and the food is sooooooooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been gong here for years! I love the feel of the neighborhood diner and they remember us every time we come in even if its been a few months."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We live in way West Phoenix and we're in the area. A car full of kids we eventually got hungry and looking for a quick burger place. We were actually going to whataburger in the same plaza but we saw Giant Burgers look at some reviews and yep as everyone said they are really big burgers the fries are crispy and delicious. It taste like real burgers, homemade. My family ate all their food, we left very happy, full and will definitely come back. The guy there is very nice. He really takes pride in his work. Now to make the looooonnngg drive home full and sleepy :) Everyone needs a giant burger in their life. Lol"}
{"text":"Very cool place!

Originally 4 stars, but the service and friendliness makes it 5!

The burgers are better than average. Still like Fuddruckers, In-N-Out, and Harvey's Wineburger better. It might be that the bun was average or that the hamburger was well done (little dry)... Still great value though.

The best part about the place... Friendly staff. Hospitable is a better word. It was entertaining to see genuinely passionate restaurateurs working through a busy lunch. 

So even though I thought lunch could have been a bit better, I walked out very happy and will be back when I'm in the area to change up the burger a bit to hopefully equal the service.

Great job Giant Hamburgers!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I love Giant Hamburgers. The staff are great. The food was delicious and cooked to order. It's not fast food. It's much better than that. When you're looking for a great fresh cooked burger Giant Hamburgers is the place to go."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a burger joint for a late dinner, and thank God we stumbled upon Giant Hamburgers because it definitely hit the spot. I got the cheeseburger and added some caramelized onions and jalapeños to it. It was so simple, but the staff definitely somehow made it taste pretty darn juicy and delicious. My friend got a chicken sandwich and a chili cheese dog, and he didn't have anything but good things to say about them. The staff was also great - even though it was late and they were probably tired, service was impeccable. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"So it was 830 in the morning and we really wanted a burger! This place delivers! Want breakfast? Done. Want a burger? No problem! The burger was really good. A nice big patty, crispy bacon, and gooey melted cheese! Definitely worth stopping in and hit the spot! Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't mind driving 11.9 miles for a fantastic hamburger at this diner style restaurant.  I have eaten here several times and everything I've ordered has been fresh and delicious, and served by a lady with an amazing sense of customer service.  I've already decided to get my Thanksgiving pies here.  They look amazing and I always see someone buying a pie while I'm there."}
{"text":"First timer. Looking through yelp for a good burger place. This was reviewed high. This place brings back amazing childhood memories of sitting at the grill of a local bowling alley. Burgers cooked on a flat top. Lots of topping. Buttery bun. Messy as heck. Delightful. The lady behind the counter delivered our milkshakes and noticed my son's black eye. She was so concerned she sat down with us and had a fun little coversation with my boy. He's 5 by the way. I felt comfortable with her sitting down. Wasn't put off at all. Burger was great. Fries were great. Shake was great. Nice job folks. We're coming back."}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for a good burger, and Giant Hamburgers delivers.

It looks like a pretty straight-forward diner inside, but what they have cooking on the griddle is really tasty.  After a lot of spicy food for the previous few days, nothing else in the immediate vicinity sounded appetizing while my wife and I were driving through Mesa looking for a bite.  I found this spot on Yelp when it was miles off and seemingly too far away, but as we drove, we just got closer and closer to it.  We kept looking for something other than diner food on Yelp, and nothing really seemed like it fit our moods.  In the meantime, this place kept getting closer and closer and we just decided that a burger was the only thing we were in the mood for.

It was nice to have something so simple and yet so delicious.  It was a burger and fries done right.  I've had a lot of ho-hum burgers in a lot of ho-hum places and I was just really pleased to eat this yummy thing in a traditional-style diner.  Service was a little chilly at the register.  Not unfriendly, just. . .probably irritated at something not connected to my visit.  I didn't let that ruin my experience.  This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Reminds me of what a 60's luncheonette might have been like. Short order grill set up like Waffle House I suppose. 

BUT Just an ok cheese burger.  Bun was very fresh but patty was greasy and flavorless. Loads of iceberg lettuce, large slice of white onion and tomato. I won't be back, prefer the Whataburger next door. ....Although the frys were quite good! 

NOT worth $10.40 for cheeseburger, frys and med soda."}
{"text":"Great burger and it's huge, took half home and it was great the next day.  The cook is a fabulous gal and cooked it to our specs."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised....just found this place on yelp search...extremely tasty burger...fresh....big....really fulfilling...now i just wanna take a nap"}
{"text":"we were going to stop at five guys but have this place a shot seeings we've been driving past it for years... excellent burger.   had the single cheese burger with pastrami and green chili... Oh man it was good.    

the server was great too offering up suggestions as we must have looked new.. fawna was great and an asset to this delish stop"}
{"text":"My husband stopped by for Sunday lunch to go. He ordered a bacon cheese burger with fries, and a plain grilled cheese with fries for me.  It was nice seeing all the meatless options at a burger place.  They have grilled cheese, 2 choice of veggie burgers, breakfast without meat, etc. 

Husband said burger was better than In and Out!  Grilled cheese was great and so were the fries.   

All were perfectly cooked and very tasty. \We want to try breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding,  the burgers are big and fresh.  As good as zinburger at a fraction of the price and none of the attitude. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft inside. Very friendly service and great prices. 
The only downside is the lack of outside seating."}
{"text":"First time coming in here was last week and to my surprise, I was by myself when I showed up but that quickly changed as a rush of people came in. 

As far as the food goes, it was decent. Good hamburger. Good Fries. It has that nice little diner feel to it which is always good. The people there were super friendly. The price of the food seemed a bit high though for the reasons I am about to say. 

If I was going to tell ownership or management anything it's that this place needs an update. Bad. The guy who took my order added up my total with a calculator. I am a trusting guy but I can see lots of people having an issue. It also took them 20 minutes to get through orders for 6 people. Getting an Ipad in there with a card swiper would eliminate all that. 

Also, this place needs a cleaning badly. It's not counter tops or floors, but the hard to reach places are kind of gross and something like just replacing the ceiling panels would make this place way nicer cause they are disgusting.

I love having a nice diner feel with freshly cooked food, but the space feels like it is on it's last leg and some updates are needed badly."}
{"text":"Very much like Nation's Giant Hamburgers in northern CA. Excellent burger in a tiny little place."}
{"text":"So I always like looking for a good burger place, the best ones are the smaller joints but anyways so I go in order and I'm not greeted, no one really acknowledged that I'm there, so I'm like hey whatever I still want to try their burgers as I watch customers come in and it's not many they are greeted and exited a different way then I was, so as I dined in I watched and listened as ppl left, thanks have a nice day come back just a very pleasant exit and so I'm the only one in the place, so I pick my stuff up throw it away as I leave nothing, a simple bye would have sufficed minus the customer service the burger was pretty decent.. Yea two stars bc the burger was good that's it not the whole experience.. 

I was there on June 24"}
{"text":"Been going there for years, the burgers are great and the pancakes are too. Doug does a great job and Oscar is over worked.
Jim the barber here, thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"Best burger ever!! Seriously. I don't get burgers anywhere but here. Plus the staff is super friendly. Love everything about this place."}
{"text":"This place is honest to the man upstairs the best burger place in the world. The owner Doug is the nicest man that believes in kindness and serving people the way he would want to if he was the customer. Food is amazing and experience is just as great."}
{"text":"Wonderful tasting Old Fashioned Cheeseburgers ..Best I've had in many years!!  hot dogs, chili & pie's just  delicious .. Prices low while quality is just High.."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here today. The food was so delicious and exactly what we hoped for. Everyone was so nice and took care of us extremely well. We all got cheeseburgers and fried that were fresh and wonderful quality. The strawberry shake was amazing and out of all the pie, coconut was the best. Keep up the excellent work staff. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love giant!! Their burgers are always yummy and my husband is obsessed with their chili cheese fries! Their banana cream pie is a pregnant girls dream and they are always so sweet when we come!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Would never have thought this place would have the best biscuits and gravy, thanks to yelpers I tried it and holy freaking moly, amazing no need for eggs n bacon next time double order of biscuits n heaven for me please!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been coming here for 9 years off and on and introduced me to this place 6 years ago. We have never been disappointed! Always good prices and ridiculously amazing food. And I mean RIDICULOUS. Their pecan pie is off the hook and their grilled cheese, that's what I usually get, is always on point.

The boyfriend always gets a burger with fries, and as a burger connoisseur he would pick their burgers over anyone else's. It has an awesome old school vibe and the employees are always thoughtful and efficient. Best whole in the wall burger joint in Mesa, hands down."}
{"text":"This was really good! Tasty burgers, really yummy bacon! Husband added pastrami to his burger. He said it was really good. The people are friendly and helpful and funny. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent for both breakfast and lunch. Ham, cheese and mushroom omelette with hashbrowns and gravy is outstanding. Their burgers rival anyone's around. Recommended."}
{"text":"Redemption!  Just tried this place again. Great service by Doug.  Burger was great even tho it was on lettuce no bun and they even made methods and island for my \"side salad\"   Gave it bad reviews out a year ago. What a turnaround."}
{"text":"Good grilled cheeseburger, fries, and med drink...all about $12.  Give this small mom and pop place a try, won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Classic. Simple. Excellent ingredients. Like being transported back to the 70's. Must try if you enjoy the real deal cheeseburger. No hipsters allowed."}
{"text":"really liked the burger.  my daughter and I came for lunch.  had chili on my fries and wish I didn't cause they put slices of American cheese on top, but the burger was good.  Service was good. next time I go I will skip the chili on the fries.  the fries I'm sure are awesome."}
{"text":"I had a ham and cheese omelette and ice tea. Total $14.45.  For standing at counter like McDonald's...I don't think so.  Best of luck with the biz."}
{"text":"Wow the cheese burger and fries were exceptionally good and the service was awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These burgers are huge and the fries are like the old fashioned crispy fries I used to get at Burger King. But this place is way better than any fast food. Best burger I've had in Phoenix and Sylvia and the other workers were very friendly. Good thing this place isn't close to where I live. I'd be there every day. They have breakfast and pies too that I'll have to try another time."}
{"text":"I certainly enjoyed having lunch here,  the burger was phenomenal.  I had the pastrami burger with fries, and chilli.  The burger was a top contender for the best in the area.  I certainly would eat here again when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, great service, what else can you ask for??? Prices are fair, it's located on the corner of broadway and Lindsay tucked away in between a subway and a massage parlor. 

Thought I already reviewed this place before but here it goes...

I ordered a double cheeseburger w/ onions, jalapeños and bacon. Delish! Everything worked together in a symphony of flavor. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were crisp and fresh. My daughters got a hotdog each and both finished theirs in record time! Hubby got a plain double cheeseburger and he loves the charbroiled flavor. We called in our order and it was ready in 10 mins and no mistakes on our order. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Eh, nothing to write home about. Overpriced standard cheeseburger with about 1/4cup of mayo on it. Fries equally as good, I assume they are cooked in oil other things are fried in. Asked for bacon on one burger-an extra 2.50 for 3 slices of bacon."}
{"text":"We had a good time at Giant Hamburgers on national hamburger day! I got the cheeseburger with grilled onions (free) and mushrooms ($.80). It was suuuuper greasy! Almost too greasy for me. But it was delicious! The fries were decent and the atmosphere was meh. I don't know if I would return just because of how greasy the burger was, but if you enjoy that then definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. The hamburgers look amazing. I had a chili dog and it was also amazing.  The chili was really good. We tried lemon meringue, pumpkin and chocolate cream. All were good but the lemon meringue was off the charts. This place is kind of a dive but if you are looking for affordable home made food this place is good."}
{"text":"The food is great here. The hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and hot dogs arre all we have tried so far, but they are really good."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I was a little nervous about the place. Maybe I've been spoiled and accustomed to a nicely decorated burger joint...this is NOT that place. This is legit a place where someone had a vision, scrapped up restaurant furniture & threw it together to make the place work. The burgers look like something you'd get at your friends, friends uncle's barbecue on a Sunday, which made me nervous (I'm talking freshly torn off the head iceberg lettuce) but it was absolutely DELICIOUS! The kind of delicious where you text the friend that recommended the place while you're trying to not choke from putting half the burger into your mouth just to say kudos! I will definitely be back and highly recommend the place. P.s. The guy,whom I assume is the manager, was super nice too which made up for the wait time on the fries"}
{"text":"I have driven by maybe a 1000 times and have never stopped in...until today! 

As far as hamburgers go, they are top notch. My wife and I both tried bacon cheese burgers. The bacon was crispy and we asked for grilled onions. There was so much cheese it was melting off the side so you could scoop it up with a fry. I went all in today and also got a chocolate shake. Heaven! Lol

The place has a hole in the wall diner feel, the workers are very nice. I left over the top full which is great, but I dont think I can come back too soon or my scale may give up on me. A single patty was more than enough."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its not a whole lot to look at when you walk in but you def can't judge this book by its cover. I think its a husband and wife that own it, he cooks and she serves (from what it looked like) and they are both super friendly. He even opened the door for me.

Not just great service but the food was amazing too. I'm a bit of a chili cheese fry expert and these have to be in my top three ... And don't you dare forget the pie! Yummmm"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Just as the other reviews say, the hamburgers are fresh and big ( I might even say GIANT ). The chili fries are just yummy, I made a meal just from them. My hubby gets the cheeseburger with jalapenos and loves it. I am having a hard time getting him to try anything else. 
I am looking forward to trying thier breakfasts. 
And just to make everyone knows where it is at, it is actually facing Lindsey Rd, with the cross street of Broadway. Just behind the Fry's market."}
{"text":"Good... Slightly better than your average burger joint but lacked a bit of seasoning and only avg quality ingredients. Staff was nice and it's homey and casual. Will try breakfast some day. I didn't care much for the pies."}
{"text":"I love this place, and if you went there, you would love it too.

One of the (many) things I miss about Southern California are the (usually)Charbroiled Burger spots that blanket the entire area from Ventura down to San Diego:  Legends like the o.g. Astro Burger, Galaxy Burger, Douglas Burger, Tam's, etc.   These burger joints served awesome burgers, great grilled sandwiches (Patty Melts, anybody?), and almost always, a great, greasy breakfast on the cheap.  Oh, and they made their food proper.... American Cheese on all burgers and sandwiches, thousand island on the burgers, no up charge for grilled onions, yadda-yadda-yadda, you get the point.  Sadly, AZ seriously lacks in these types of establishments.

Enter Giant Hamburgers.  While their burgers aren't charbroiled, they're wonderful.  Their Grilled Ham and Cheese is out of this world (just remember to order it \"plain\" with only the ham and cheese on buttery, grilled sourdough... YUM!).  Try an open-faced chili burger, or maybe even a gardenburger, if you like retarded shit.  Their Chili-Cheese fries are a real treat, especially since they melt a few slices of American Cheese on top instead of that bullshit cheddar some places use.  Thirsty for something sweet?  Try a hand-made, uber thick shake.  Still hungry after all that?  Have a jumbo slice of homemade pie.

Wait!  What if it's 9am and your stomach's not ready for Chili Cheese Fries?  No problem, their breakfasts will surely satisfy any cravings you might have.  Sold as a Single, Double, or Triple, their egg combos come with eggs, hash browns, toast, and your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, hamburger patty, bacon, or steak for an additional charge.  Don't want eggs?  No problem, they've got pancakes and the best looking biscuit and gravy plate I've seen in years.

You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you as you're chillin' in 50's-style booths enjoying the music and ambiance of an old school diner.  The place is always busy and the staff is always very friendly, but not in an overly friendly, obnoxious way.  A Triple breakfast plate will set you back about $8 with tax.  Burger, fries, and a drink will get you for about the same.  They are more than willing to substitute or customize your order however you want it, usually at no charge.  

You will enjoy this place, trust me."}
{"text":"This is literally the best hamburger place I have ever been to. The staff is all super friendly and helpful. The burgers are FANTASTIC. They are fresh and delicious. This has a cute diner vibe to me. It's got good music playing all the time. My friend got hash browns and biscuits and gravy and it was huge! The food comes plenty. My pie was so good and was big. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing 10 years ago and it still is amazing today! Glad I accidentally came into this little hole in the wall joint twice in my life. I made my own burger which was worth the extra cost of toppings because when you order bacon, you get some BACON! Make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"You need to be a David to slay this Giant. This place has been reviewed by the Arizona Republic and has won the best burger award in Mesa 2015. It certainly makes my best burger list. This \"Giant Burger\" is fresh ground beef, not a pre-made frozen patty. It has to be at least 1/3 pound to start with. They use large buns to accommodate this monster with all the toppings.

I ordered the cheese burger. I substituted the regular cheese for Swiss cheese. I added bacon and mushrooms. There are several more add-ons I could have chosen from. Add-ons are an extra charge. This all comes with tomato, lettuce, onions, mustard, and mayo. When I got the burger, It was over 3\" high. It looked like one of those burgers they show on TV. You know, the kind that looks like a real hand full but when you get one your 3 year old could handle it. This was not the case. I had to struggle to get my hands around it without loosing any or completely squashing it.

The burger was cooked perfectly. The other toppings added to the perfection. I would have wanted a little more mustard and should have ordered catsup. (Catsup is on the side and has to be requested) I seriously wanted a piece of pie afterward, as they have a variety of fresh baked pies, but after eating half a cow I was stuffed. They also serve breakfast as well which may be worth trying. I can only imagine what their Giant Omelet is like. 

A couple things worth noting. They charge 60 cents for using plastic to pay with. The restroom is a uni-sex bathroom behind the grill and through the dish room."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after reading some of the great reviews and I must say it really was  good! I had a cheeseburger,strawberry shake and fries all of which were very tasty! The only downside it that it is pricey considering it's all sold a la carte and they don't have kid size portions. Other than that it's worth a visit if you're feeling a old school burger and fries type joint! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and myself went to Giant Hamburgers.  This place is very simple, but the hamburgers are good.  My wife liked the hamburger she ordered.  Be careful though in this place, as most stuff here is calorie laden.  Be aware."}
{"text":"Great  foods. I been many times
 Always fast service.   I wonder why they can't paint the walls and replace the water stained ceiling tiles."}
{"text":"I love these little diner style places!  I would always rather give my business to a local than a corporation.  I stopped in here last night and grabbed a Fiesta Burger with cheese.  It's a big burger with 2 grilled green chilis!  OMG! This is not 1st date food!  Burger juice and ketchup dripping off your chin and running down your elbow is not attractive unless you're into the whole 9 1/2 weeks thing....

I didn't order anything else, because I didn't want to have that miserable \"Thanksgiving full\" feeling, but it all looked great.  They were dropping fries, spinning shakes, and had a variety of tempting pies in the display window.

Great food.  Great price!  Love that you can get breakfast anytime, too!

Oh yeah!  They'll now let you use a debit card for a $.50 fee.  No more worries about not having cash."}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice old school diner atmosphere. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch place. Just wanted to clarify \"super cheap\" from other comments. It's basically $5-8. Cheap if you're on a work lunch, not necessarily if you're with poor students. Oh, and bring cash."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best spot for burgers and fries! The service is awesome, and friendly, and they even bring the food to your table. My girlfriend and I have been there at least a dozen times and have never had any complaints. If I had to pick something to complain about, it would simply be that this place is underrated, and needs more attention and more locations. 

Love these burgers!!!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast food, pie, how could you go wrong? I admit their burgers aren't the best I've had but  they are good and I'd get them again. I do have to admit that I lived in southern California for a long time, where burger spots like this were ALL over the place, and many of them were very good so it's probably an unfair comparison. 

What I especially love are their breakfasts. You can get breakfast for so cheap it's ridiculous, between $5-$9 to stuff yourself silly and everything tastes very good. The employees are so friendly. Service is quick, it's seat yourself and order at the counter. I'm really glad this place exists."}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers in the valley. Cooked to order after ordered and served hot. The fries are wonderful. The service is great. If you have never been,  you are missing a real treat."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews, we were expecting this place to be amazing. 

Let's start with the woman that took our order. She was very curt. Being my first time in the restaurant, I had a few questions, but she was not very helpful and seemed annoyed when I didn't know things (what comes on the burgers, how to order, whether or not they have certain toppings available). On the plus side, I found out that their meat is fresh cut from the butcher, no additives, and most of the pies are handmade in the shop. 

Food service was prompt. Decor was dated, but the place seemed clean enough. The lady that cleaned up our table was very nice. 

My husband wasn't very impressed with his burger. He said it was okay and the fries were good. His soda was flat, even after they tried to fix the machine. Kids liked their grilled cheese. I had a burger patty with a bunch of fresh and grilled veggies, no bun. I thought it was good. Everything was fresh and well-portioned. 

My husband got s slice of pie to go and enjoyed it. I wish I could eat ice cream, because everyone in the place was eating these huge milkshake things that looked awesome!

2 burgers + grilled cheese + fries + 1 soda = $19. Fair price, decent food, maybe we will come back sometime. My husband gives it 3 stars, I give it 3.5."}
{"text":"The only reason they're called Giant Hamburger is because Humongous Burger was just too darn long to say as you were shoving this giant burger in your mouth!  Not only did they cook the meat to perfection, the \"everything on it\" only makes it better (try the onions grilled!) Great meal and there is no question, Like Arnie, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think it went well.  The only black mark I would give would be on the time we waited (but this isn't McDonald's so there's lots if forgiveness). 

My hubs ordered the triple and I the double, no wonder the lady looked at us like we had two heads when we ordered fries. She should be thankful we didn't order that extra burger.. Our mistake, we ordered enough food to feed a small African village and could come close to actually finishing it.. Next time I'll take the hint..

Good value and good quality, I like the diner feel but it's a bit loud for my flavor, especially when the suspected \"lady of the night\" in the booth behind us was dropping f* bombs like it was her business, maybe it is, I don't judge..I love the occasionally colorful verb just like anyone else, just not at breakfast on a Sunday.."}
{"text":"This place was on point with service and food, the reviews are not lies. After a little intimidation at the order counter, the guy who took our orders eased up on us...I guess he figured out we were newbies.

We got the pastrami burger and bacon cheeseburger - YUM and YUM!!! The burgers had good flavor and were juicy! The pastrami was also tender and not super fatty which I LOVE!

We just got the regular fries and that was good - crispy and hot, plain and delish!

I ended up ordering a chocolate shake after we finished eating, and it was the first time I ever had a shake in a container...not a cup.Since we were leaving I had to ask for a lid and there was a cute set of cuts in it so you could put your straw through it - very smart!

I am going to try and make it back there on the next visit to Arizona, so worth it!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I expected a knock out burger. I went with the bacon cheeseburger which was apparently their most popular dish. Nothing about it tasted fresh. The bun was nearly stale, the bacon had no crisp and the patty.... oh man the patty was very reminiscent of the patties you would get at a high school cafeteria. I guess $13 for a burger and fries (no drink) set my expectations a little too high."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger, fries and a large drink. Was about $10.00 per person. Pleasantly filling large portions. The fries looked like Arby's fries. But they are extra large normal tasting fries. Very good tasting food. Might have to try chili or their steak for $5.10 next time. Yummmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Classic diner atmosphere and food. Perfect meal for nostalgia.  High quality beef and melt in your mouth taste. Great shake- one of the best I have ever had. Makes you feel like your back in the 70's. They have a good hamburger just not spectacular ."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what's so special about this place. They make a good burger but it's just a hamburger. We got the $6.45 cheeseburger x 3, two pancakes ($2.55), ham and cheese ($6.10), and a one egg giant breakfast. Nothing was overly giant. We didn't get drinks and our bill was $35. I thought that was kind of expensive. We also didn't get fries as it was 3pm and they were sitting under a warmer and didn't look that fresh. My average review probably won't hurt them as it seems others love this place."}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers is the bees knees. Absolutely amazing all around. Great food that is extremely filling and delicious. The staff was very kind and made me feel like a regular even though it was my first time. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a big step up from fast food for a little more money - but well worth it. No one in our party had leftovers. Shakes and malts were yummy and very filling. Lots of choices on the menu. Friendly and helpful staff. Would return. If it were a bit closer to my home, I'd be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Well, my wife had a hair in her shake sooo that is disgusting. Burgers were about a 3/5 and the fries were good and crisp. They gave us 3 bucks back for the shake and apologized. Overall it was too expensive, almost $30 and we could have went to Red Robin for that much. We were dissatisfied with our experience and won't be returning :/"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best burger place I ever had!!! I heard about this from a co worker! He told me it was family owned and has been there for years.. I'm a sucker for family owned food. It's always the best. These burgers are AMAZING. It's a big patty, never frozen beef, scrumptious tomatoes, and amazing chili cheese fries! Everything is SO GREAT. you won't regret it! Doug is also a GREAT owner- cares about his customers. I will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is a little bit pricier, but the value is there! I have never been disappointed in any selection I've had whether it's a burger, breakfast, or dessert. I also love the fact that this place is locally owned and everyone that works there takes great pride. They all act like a family and treat all of the customers the same. If you're looking for a wonderful burger joint, this is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes after reading the many good reviews.  what I found was good local hole in the wall that is somewhat over rated.
my burger was very dry - as the cook pressed down on the patties I kept screaming in my head PLEASE STOP!
The fries were very meh.  They were crunchy but had no character.
The best thing was that the ingredients were fresh.  While the patties were preformed they were not frozen.  They used plent of bacon so there was a piece in every bite.  The lettuce was green and crisp and overall it was a decent lunch, but over priced for what I got.  I probably won't make another trip back but if I lived nearby I would return rather than hit a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Fresh great tasting burgers and the milkshakes are real ice cream thick and delicious. The owners are very nice and you can call in your order ahead of time for pick up. Set up like a diner."}
