{"text":"A friend of mine and I stopped in to watch her boyfriends' band play and have a couple drinks and if it weren't for him playing I would've left. Honestly, never at one point have I thought \"Hey, I'd like to go to a cool bar tonight and watch some good music, how bout E-strings?\" It was just full of kids and I couldn't get a drink too quickly.

I've also heard some really terrible things about how the owner feels about talent so I don't want to support that. If I want to see some great bands, I'll check out downtown. If I want crappy mozzarella sticks, basic beer, loud music and out of touch owners? I'll come here."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a couple fiends. It was the fourth or fifth time I have been here to sing some karaoke, I love this place. My DJ Paul kicked major ass, I have been here for Redd and A.C. Too and they are always great. Bartenders are nice and quick, place needs a facelift a bit structurally but it's a real down home bar. Paul made my night, guy was really cool and helped me with everything I needed. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good hole in the wall"}
{"text":"This place was a blast. I met up with a few of my colleagues on a Tuesday and this place rocked. Cute staff with great attitudes, drinks where brought out quickly (always a plus) and even the other patrons where all in high spirits. I will definitely go there again and recommend it to all my peers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and to check out the karaoke. The drinks were terrible. Out of the 7songs, 5 were Disney show tunes. It was like being in a kid's clubhouse. Not going back."}
{"text":"Every time I move to a new neighborhood I look for a watering hole. Some place I can chill and eat and drink whilst getting to know my neighbors. The food here is fresh and delicious. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection. The staff is always friendly and people always introduce their selves and are willing to chat. This has become my new watering hole. I will keep on strumming the E-String!"}
{"text":"The Sunday night comedy show was fantastic!! The host Devon was amazing, and the performers were hilarious. Free entrance and drink prices were great, my husband and I will definitely back!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you have a neon sign to get the bartenders attention. Also not the place to play pool, only one table that has a reputation of braking and taking your money. In which the bar will not refund. Other than that the drink selection is that of a stadium and prices are of the strip. Not cheap. Plus it's full of weird karaoke people."}
{"text":"Great place to have some drinks, win at Keno, and hang with good friends. They've redone the whole place too..."}
{"text":"As a lifelong New Yorker now living in Las Vegas, this pizza is as authentic as it gets. Delicious fresh pizza, pasta and the arugula salad was so fresh and amazing. There was a jazz band playing when we arrived for lunch on Saturday afternoon. I'd definitely come back. I highly recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Im sorry but the kj (karaoke jockey) sucks. He puts people who pays more in front of paid customers. Wtf??? He said himself that whoever pays more gets to sing 1st.  Which is fuckd up cause we were waiting for 4 hrs to sing a song  (1) so if you  (kj) want to be that way.  Fuck it.  He works for tips.  Don't  fucken tip him or any1 that works at e strings. Get better  employees. Serious."}
{"text":"I love this establishment. Karaoke with great KJs every night!
Right now the rating is so low because the mica are FUCKED!! Get new quality microphones and you will get a higher rating"}
{"text":"jennifer and jannalee are the best bartenders ever.. not only did we have an amazing time here singing and dancing in the karaoke room but the drinks were strong and delicious !! this is most definitely going to be my new hangout!! cheers to a great time and the staff!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love love LOVE this bar. Jen is my favorite I'm always there to see her. Tim is an extremely close second (ask for his Bloody Mary's). Also the new young bartender is amazingly helpful and handsome to boot. Definitely the best bar in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars.  It is clear that the good reviews are from staff. The place is as inviting as a bee hive just hit by a stick. Hopecit goes under so something decent can replace it."}
{"text":"Been to this bar a few times it was okay went there Sunday night angel was a breath of fresh air to come to this light great customer service"}
{"text":"For a minute, I thought we were on the Strip. $18 for a pitcher of domestic beer?! Nope. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you drive past for years and keep saying one day I want to stop off and check the place out.  Well, that day (or night) finally happened.  But it took a Tower of Power tribute band named East Bay Grease to do it.  

My girlfriend and I met our friends in the bar the night of 02/28/11.  The bartender was cute, friendly and promptly brought over our drinks.  My buddy ordered scotch on the rocks and though he didn't complain, the glass was 100% ice with very little scotch.  I ordered a beer - $3.50.  Noticing ash trays throughout the bar, I inquired whether or not cigar smoking was allowed.  I was informed yes by the bartender.  I took out my Arturo Fuente and lit up.  A few enjoyable puffs and 5 minutes later, I saw the familiar whispering and gesturing.  The bartender came over and told me she was just talking to the owner who said cigar smoking was NOT allowed.  Gee - that's why I asked first.  Interesting that the owner himself didn't come up to me.  

Shortly before the band started to play, I asked the bartender to order us some spinach/artichoke dip with chips.  It never arrived.

I grew up listening to Tower of Power and I must say that this tribute band was spot on.  They played all my old favorites over the course of two sets.  I was totally surprised at the lack of people - I counted less than 20.  Despite the fact of the place being so cold inside, this was a totally enjoyable evening.  In my younger years, I used to frequent establishments like this all the time so it brought back some good memories.  I will also be on the lookout for more performances by East Bay Grease.

I noticed slot machines at the bar - but since they don't allow cigar smoking I'll have to gamble elsewhere.  But I will certainly return to watch more great music."}
{"text":"Second time here. I Always give second chances. FAIL AGAIN. If you're not a friend of the DJ they ask you to tip $20 to sing. Crap. Go to karaoke places on Spring Mountain. Better sound and better singers. People here sound like they're reading you a story instead of singing."}
{"text":"Late night bored and have a bit of courage, this place is one of If not the best place in town for karaoke. The food isn't bad either from their Buffalo chicken fingers and fries to their grilled cheese sandwiches the food is good enough to keep you around while you wait your turn to sing."}
{"text":"Fun to go Karaoke w/ friends ! Usually not a big crowd. But the crowd- yes that can be either a hit or miss. One time I went and it was all heavy metal songs over and over again - and IMO that was terrible. Another night, it was a bunch of country songs and a good mix/variety which was fantastic. Drinks are pretty cheap - I think about 3 dollars for PBR or draft budlight and ab 6 bucks for mixed drink"}
{"text":"Upgrade from my previous review. Its much better when you order a pie. I still hate bars, but would have no problem picking up a pizza ans makimg a special trip to do it.

Really good.

A go-to? Quite possibly. 

NY pizza people: it folds and drips the right way."}
{"text":"We came in to visit for a family birthday and birthday girl wanted to go to a karaoke bar, so I looked on Yelp to find a place to go....which is how we found E-String.  The bar is divided up with the bar on one area, a pool table in another area, and a nice sized room with a stage, monitors, and the KJ in corner.  

Seemed like they had an unlimited amount of songs to choose from.  This was a first for me at a karaoke bar, and it was really enjoyable.  They had a nice mix of people who can really sing as well as people who really shouldn't...but do anyway.

Prices were reasonable, and the service was very friendly. 

Two thumbs and five stars for this place!"}
{"text":"This is a hell hole! 

I was in town visiting some friends and this is the place they decided to take me. I always forget that not all places are created equal, but I give everything a try. And try I did. A few things through me off...

-There were minors in the bar. The bartenders kept warning everyone that if they were underage to leave because the cops frequent the place. Shouldn't someone be checking IDs?

-I spent $7.00 on and order of fries. They weren't even a good size of fries and they were under cooked.  If you're going to charge me that much for an order of fries I need them to jump off the table and slap me because they are so good.

-The karaoke DJ was obnoxious! he catered to the staff at the bar and spent the other time being pushy about people tipping him.

I'm a good sport, but I'd rather ride the bench."}
{"text":"Pizza and karaoke......!!!! No brainier! Been coming here many years. Hope it sarts to stay open later. Staff is so fun and entertaining. Laughed my butt off! Plus great food and singing.... What more can I ask for? My girlfriend and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"This review is just for the karaoke. I went a couple days before Christmas, and the vibe was so fun. Karaoke DJ has absolutely everything, good mix of performances, and happy hour starting at 11 means everyone had their liquid courage going. Bartenders were also super nice - one was nice enough to pour me a shot of water with my round of shots for my group. Overall, highly recommend for some suburban karaoke!"}
{"text":"Cool bar. Nice atmosphere! Food was superior to most bar food places in Vegas. Had a chicken sandwich that was excellent!!! I didn't expect it to be. Drinks are reasonable and they poured heavy!!! Bathrooms were decent Was there for a comedy night and had a good time with my husband. Will definitely go back. Didn't give it 5 stars because the booth we sat in was really damaged and was extremely uncomfortable.  But that was the only drawback of the place. It had a dive bar feel without being too divey."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time! We will definitely be back to this place a lot and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. My girlfriend is from Italy and gave her stamp of approval. Fun, clean atmosphere, with a super nice staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!!! AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY THE BEST I'VE HAD IN THIS AREA!!! I'm from New England and so I thought I knew who made the BEST pizza until now. This is our usual hangout for beers karaoke etc. but since they now have pizza I knew some day I'd try it... Last night at a we ordered the Sicilian thick crust and I'm glad I did! The entire menu looked amazing but this is the one we went with. Simply amazing... we'll be back!!! I would give this pizza a five million star rating if I could!!! GOTTA TRY THIS PIZZA!!! Also, the outdoor patio is HUGE and they welcome all fur babies!!!! We brought our dog (and I think he lived the pizza too!)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! First time ordering from them and we got the BBKing with garlic and pepperoni. Hands down the best pizza around. Love the New York style!!! Cannot wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday went there to watch the Royal Rumble ( don't judge!) and ordered the Duke pizza which is basically a white pie! It was delicious! I added pepperoni to it and loved it. The pizza is as close to NY/NJ as I can find. Only regret is no Italian sausage."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. Music too loud in the dining room."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Went for a friends birthday for karaoke. The karaoke guy AC only ever played songs from his friends and never played anyone else! When you went to complain he had a bad attitude and was extremely rude!!! It would have been one thing if his friends were good singers with crowd pleaser songs BUT NO!! It was musical theater (hello Ms Saigon) and slow jams. I wanted to slit my wrists!!! Never again. If I could give it negative stars, I would. I'm also calling the manager to complain."}
{"text":"So, I have only been here to watch the Battle of the Bands: A fight To Fame that my brothers band was participating in ( and won first place!! --sorry had to brag a little there..hehe). But, I never ate anything here that night. There is a dining area where the stage is, but for this event that whole room is full of ppl and the only place to eat is in the bar room, and that packed with ppl, and bartenders trying to fill drinks and orders and yeaaa, I wasn't in the mood to eat! 

HOWEVER!, the place is decent looking and clean. It seems like a good place to have a drink after work or something. From what I heard that night, the nachos were pretty good. I don't know how good but i heard good things about it. I don't think this review would be too helpful, but I thought I'd just write one anyway! Sorry if I wasted your time :P lol"}
{"text":"I love this place...I will be here again tonight for the comedy see you'll tonight...im here from Atlanta again"}
{"text":"This bar has been my home for 4 years. All my friends are here and the bartenders are awesome!! Karaoke is fun and they have a huge library of songs to choose from. Everyone should be at this bar!"}
{"text":"New owners. No longer bar food, just pizza. It is decent pizza, just expensive. Speaking of expensive, a shot of jager is $7!

Friendly bartenders keep me coming back. Pool tables, jukebox, shuffleboard. Cheap happy hours. Very smoky smelling. Cool Fender bar stool and rock paraphernalia laminated onto the tables. 

Karaoke brings in a big crowd, and bands and jazzy/r&b events seem to have a following as well. I think there is a trivia night as well. There is the normal PTs vibe of sports on tv and the keno/video poker. 

The booths need lighting near the steps as I've fallen over them several times. 

Large patio as well. Plenty of parking in back. 

They also have a vintage guitar store in the back."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, reminiscent of the New York style pizza you get in Little Italy and the great pizzerias around New Jersey.  The new award winning pizza chef takes great pride in his food, and he came over personally to see if the pizza met our expectations.  Of course, it exceeded them.  Our waitress was also great, wonderful personality and very attentive.  Highly recommend checking this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"The music/entertainment room here is fantastic. Food is kinda pricey and just EHHish. Drinks are average prices for the area, but the bartenders are cool and quick to take care of you."}
{"text":"Parking lot is a little sketchy, this place is for the older crowd clearly.  Went with my guy and he didn't feel quite welcome, said the joint was a bit rough. I didn't think anything of it, but there where some shady people hanging out on the patio where we were. We went back inside to the pool table area. In the next room over there was a karaoke thing going on, doors where closed so we could talk to each other. However people would constantly come out and leave the doors open so that the music and singer would drown the conversation. Place isn't bad but not the greatest place to hang."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Great Service!!! The style I like. All fresh ingredients. Everyone is super nice, try this place."}
{"text":"In a word: amazing. Had the basic New York-style cheese and pepperoni (Ziggy Stardust). The crust is light and crispy,  but still substantial enough to hold the cheese and toppings. And that cheese--holy wow. Real mozzarella. Thick and creamy and so good. Sauce is also great, and the pepperoni was perfect. The real stuff, not some crap from a restaurant supply company. After, the owner/chef, Don, came over to check how the meal was. (Ask to meet him; he's awesome). Final shout out to waitress Christine, who was also aces. You'd never suspect one of the best pizzerias in Vegas is in a dive bar in Henderson, but it is. Go there. Now."}
{"text":"Great live blues band...
We had a large group 50 + only one waiter poor guy, therefore slow service. He was good though.  Estring was warned and should have been prepared.  kitchen staff must have been overwhelmed as well. We just had chips and salsa. ..way too salty. They need happy hour special prices on food."}
{"text":"First time here and it's definitely an awesome local hangout! If you love music, definitely worth checking it out!! Super chill and laid back place to chill on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre bar, but a fab karaoke spot.

There's two main areas - a long bar with video poker and a \"restaurant\" with booth and table seating. There's also a couple of pool tables when you first walk in.

The bar area is on the smaller side. There's TVs and gaming. It's a typical Vegas bar. The bartenders are hit or miss on service. The beer offerings are decent.

The food menu is overpriced and contains the typical items you'd expect at any bar place. There's no actual service in the \"restaurant\" / dining area (at least during the week). You have to go to the bar to place your drink and food orders.

Of the food items, the most unique and tasty are the dirty wedges. Yum! Big potato wedges smothered in bacon, onions, cheese, gravy, and thousand island. They most definitely hit the spot after a few drinks. And they're a large portion, so there's plenty to share.

What is most awesome here is the karaoke. And they have it every night of the week! The KJ is probably the best I've experienced around town. The dining area is the perfect karaoke setup - there's a stage and everything. The screens are large and the next 3 singers are displayed scrolling across the bottom of the screen - so you always know where you are in the lineup. There's no songbook, but just ask the KJ for any song you want, he'll probably have it. And we're talking about obscure stuff I've never seen at any other karaoke spot ever. During the week, the crowd is on the smaller side, which means you can sing several songs in one night.

All in all, I'm a fan. It's got a dive-y feel without being overly grunge-y. There's a late night happy hour. The music theme is pretty cool. And the karaoke rocks."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! Delicious thin crust that melts in your mouth, and the cheese.....something magical! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Everytime I go it's super fun.. the karaoke is fun to do and the food is amazing for a bar themed establishment. I plan on going again pretty soon!!!"}
{"text":"In town and needed a place to watch Monday night football. (Go Giants!) This bar is really relaxed, and has an awesome vibe! Friendly, amazing staff and amazing pizza. Well done Chef Donny! Best place for a pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"Randomness walkin to a 9 piece brass band with crazy vocals.I couldn't believe that this was happening in in Vegas and on a wed. The bbq chicken pizza is sooooo good :) Beers offered small or large. :) great prices."}
{"text":"I want to say thank you E String! Karaoke was so fun!!  Wished you were open later. Its one of the only reasons why I come... Besides the fabulous  bartenders! There really isnt any other places like this around here. And the atmosphere has a great vibe. Will return... Its a must"}
{"text":"We came here for an event and my bestfriend and her band were performing for the first time EVAAAAAAAR! 
It was super fun... The bar service was great and good prices on drinks, however the servers themselves were difficult to come by. 
The mozzarella sticks were good too. :))"}
{"text":"I really like this place, not many like it, especially in Vegas.  The live music is hit or miss but the ambiance can be a blast with the right crowd.  Too much cigarette smoke in the bar -  they should be smarter that's where the slots are."}
{"text":"Best New York pizza  in town.  Chef Dani is donnie Is spectacular. Will go there again when I visit Vegas in December."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends and this place is a freaking dump. I get that it's a somewhat cheaper local place, but it's gross. The pool area is a joke and looks awful. The service was awful too. The bartenders were busy dancing with each other instead of filling people's orders or even acknowledging people waiting. Not ever going back here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local, quality, and honest karaoke bar in henderson, Estring on Sunset in Henderson is NOT the establishment you're looking for. In years past, the bar may have fit that description to a T, but that time has passed. 

Now, Estring is trying  (and failing) to offer the standard Vegas nightclub experience: high BPM music played much too loud -loud enough in fact to crackle the old karaoke speakers-, a low energy but pompous DJ behind an array of keys and knobs -that he clearly isn't terribly familiar with-, and booth reservation service -if you're friends with the owner, and/or leave enough hundreds as a tip.

If you're looking to have your group asked to move from a booth you've been sitting in for the better part of an hour so that VIP patrons can take it, or a head-ringing slog through poorly organized events that adhere to no real schedule, Estring may be the place for you.

If you're looking for the same great karaoke, talented KJs, and attentive staff you remember the place for... unfortunately, Estring is no longer for you."}
{"text":"Worst place to go! I've gone here twice and no one has carded me and then I went here with some friends well over 21 and they asked for id when we were going into the karaoke lounge and this girl with blonde hair and seam to be high on meth with this older lady asked for id. They didn't even look like they worked there, came asking for id's with their bags in their hands and then we left because my friend didn't have her id but she had other papers to prove her age, and they cussed at us telling us they'd call the police and we just acted like the bigger person and left because they wanted to start a scene. The service is rude and needs new employees"}
{"text":"It's been a looooong time since I've reviewed anything on Yelp, but couldn't resist sharing something so well-deserved. Went here last night because I heard they have a new chef specializing in NY style pizza. 

We ordered a plain cheese pizza which was amazing (5/5) and cheese ravioli (3/5).

Crust was deliciously thin in the middle with the outsides a bit thicker. It had a nice chew to it, without being doughy. Excellent flavor. Crust was good enough to dip into the extra sauce leftover from our ravioli. 

Sauce is a puréed San Marzano recipe. Perfect. Same sauce is on their ravioli. However, the cheese ravioli were just okay 3/5. 

Cheese was quality whole milk mozzarella. Perfect ratio on the pizza. 

The pizza size was either 16\" or 18\". Perfect. $17 for a plain pie and worth every penny. I highly suggest trying their pizza if you're looking for NY style. I'm a big fan of Carmine's Pizza Kitchen and Rocco's, but E String is now my favorite. My only gripe is they're closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and only open during dinner hours during the week with the exception of lunch and dinner hours on Friday and Saturday. Hopefully this will change."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. after i had directed an acquaintance to check this place out one night a few weeks ago, based on his opinion, i decided to check out this place on a friday night. its location is like in the middle of a housing community. the place itself and the decor and theme is good. The bar walls reminded me of hard rock hotel with all the guitars hung up. 

They had a live local rock band playing that night and of course i didn't know since it was my first time and just not even invited me. The place reaks of cigar and cigarette smell.. the place was stuffy so it didnt help the fact that i couldnt breathe. The place was real loud.. 

I would check this place out again if I went with a big group.. otherwise NO.."}
{"text":"First time here though I've always wanted to check it out.. came in at 9pm, no waiters/waitresses. Guy came to clean the table next to us, I asked if we could order from him he said yes but next time we should just go to the bar to order food and drinks, we ended up just going to the bar to order and find ourselves a table after.. KJ- karaoke Jockey was full of himself and his \"friends\" they basically took over the whole night. Usually if there are people in line to sing the KJ just let's everyone sings.. but NO the KJ had to sing in less than 2 hours he sang 3 songs and kept saying he has just been drinking so bear with him.. I didn't get a chance to sing since I never saw my song come up.. would love to come back maybe with a different KJ.. I hope management does a secret shop and see what needs to be fixed with this place.."}
{"text":"I am not usually one for writing reviews however with my experience last night, I believe it warrants a warning... Yes, Estrings  is a  busy spot on a Saturday night. So busy you are given a 4 hour wait to sing one song.. Wait what???? Well, yes. I have been here times before with friends and we have had fun experiences. Last night was a joke... My friends and I were excited for a night out and met up there at  10 pm. We put in our songs and started the night with a round of drinks ready for the evening.. Fast forward ahead 4 hours... My friends had left 2 hours into the night, 2 of them not even getting to sing their songs, we were watching and listening to others entering, singing,  2-3 songs then leaving.... As we waited and waited.. I got to sing 1 of the 3 songs within those 4 hours. Here is where the warning begins.... I approached the Kj about the long wait and he immediately got defensive. I asked him about others repeatedly singing while we waited and waited.. I guess we were not the \"IN\" crowd and he stated that it was such a busy night. I've been here times before on a busy night and had a great time being able to sing the songs we wanted. I then told him that I did give him a hefty tip. And then he proceeded to tell me that the men that sang many times gave him $40 dollars.. I asked, wait, I come in and drop more money and I sing more? He states\"well, that's how I make my money.\"...  \"I'm gonna stop talking now!\", he then rudely dismisses me. I put my hands in the air and return to my seat. He then proceeds to come to me and return my $10.00 tip,!saying he didn't need my money. I said that's great because I will talk to the owner and or write a review. He then rudely said, \" go ahead, I'm  the best DJ here and he'll back me up. Ya, you might be a great DJ, but what awful customer service ... I thought that's good, because I didn't  get to sing anyway, so he knew he didn't deserve my tip. I then went to pay my tab with the bartender so we could leave, I mentioned my experience with him and was met with yet another rude remark, saying, well go ahead and do what you gotta do to make us look bad. My reaction to that was \"what?? Why are you so defensive? I had great bar service!\" I told him. His demeanor changed as he tries to then shake my hand and asked my name... After that I decided he didn't have to know my name because they would probably talk shit about me later ... As I return to the Karaoke room, I see a woman, on stage, standing over a man who is laying on the stage, she proceeds to drop her pants in front of everyone showing her ass!! Full moon.. She repeats this 3 times !!!! Shut the front door!!! It is time to leave I say to myself...So, I have been their repeat customer about 4-5 times, but will never return.. Can I give any advice to the owner? Well, maybe teach your employees customer service!!!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"Don't be fooled by the humble location.  This is the best pizza I have ever had.  That counts some world class pies in New York and Chicago.  This is a real foodie experience hidden next to a poker bar.  Simple recipes prepared meticulously.  Check it out, LV!"}
{"text":"The food tastes delicious. Karaoke night was extremely fun. Just extremely LOUD. The prices for what you get are a little too much though."}
{"text":"I love the bar's cozy, friendly atmosphere and the regulars that hang out. This is the only bar that has karaoke nightly till 3 am or later, depending on the number of singers that are on rotation. Their song list is, by far, the most updated and most extensive among all the karaoke services at other nearby venues. AC was the KJ hosting Saturday night when I went there. There were about 50 singers in the queue, but he was very professional in handling the crowd and also demonstrated awesome technical skills with the sound equipment. (He made me sound good!!!)

 If you have a case of stage fright or need to do some \"vocal experimentation\", best nights to pop your karaoke cherry or get some practice down would be Wednesday and Thursday nights. Their excellent sound system makes them a popular hangout for professional and amateur singers - it feels like a free concert sometimes.

Their kitchen also cranks out great bar food and is open late on weekends. Bar staff are very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"So far, so good! Late night crowd is nice and fun. Bar tender helped personalize my drink with enthusiasm.
You can never go wrong with karaoke. Always a good time with friends!"}
{"text":"Some of the staff is wonderful! But there is one who has no customer services skills. I asked for a bloody mary, which he refused to make because he was \"busy\" (there weren't many people in the bar). He overcharged for my drinks. He handled me being angry about this so poorly. I've never had such bad service, to the point of calling in to complain...  He just had a bad attitude and was overall a poor bartender. 

Also, the sign says 3 doller well drinks, but apparently on weekends, they're 5. They don't tell you that til you close your tab and see your receipt. The sign says \"nightly\" not weeknights.
I usually like this place alright, when I'm just there for karaoke. But the bar side needs work. Like, new staff work."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports and have a beer, but the pizza was horrible. Completely burned on the bottom with barely any pepperoni on top. It was extremely greasy, even for pizza. Had higher hopes based on some of the reviews."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! Karaoke every night, sometimes live bands or a dj. Great pizza and other food too! I recommend everyone to come here if you wanna find a nice bar or pizzeria to go to"}
{"text":"Went there last night to have a drink after the rodeo.  The separate Karaoke room was absolutely terrific, great local performances, but had to leave when a couple of knuckleheads decided to smoke in the room rather than take their offensive habit outside.  I will go back, but hopefully they will post some rules."}
{"text":"I've always driven past this place & never really paid attention. The new white paint actually catches your attention. I decided to stop in for a drink. It's a Monday & I could use a pick me upper....They actually have a great menu. And not your average bar food. Felt more like a gourmet burger joint. 

I decided to get the Tuna Steak burger. Yup. Time to get out of my comfort zone. Why not. It's was absolutely delightful. Played a little pool & shuffleboard. Bruh, you can actually take pictures with the jukebox. I thought that was pretty awesome. Had a random date with me. Sooo, No, I won't be posting those pictures on here. Hell No! 

Bartender chic was very friendly. I remember she introduced herself. But , I don't remember her name. It's me. I'm the problem. The patio has seating too. Apparently, they do karaoke nightly & comedy on Sunday. Who knew! 

The burger hit the spot. I ate half. Took the rest home. I'm actually taking pictures in bed as I chow down. Ol gal got the Americana burger. She swears it's better than In & Out. I wish we ordered coffee. I wonder if she would have thought it was better than Starbucks. Just saying. I love In & out but I'll have to take her word on this since she finished hers. Didn't even offer me a bite....

This burger ain't gonna eat itself."}

{"text":"This bar has been my home away from home for the past five years.   Most times, the bar has a great sense of community,  good music, best karaoke around, great kjs, good priced food and beer, renovations are always happening to make the bar a better place, I've met great friends here and adore the place.  Most the bartenders are friendly and provide excellent service. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pizza here. E-String, which is under new management, has given Henderson a top level pizzeria. Last night, I devoured several slices of the Pepperoni while many others in the group enjoyed \"The Duke\". Two things really stood out to me. 1) the ingredients and TLC each pie had 2) the size of the pizzas. You certainly get great value in addition to some of the tastiest pizza around. I live in NW Las Vegas and will certainly be making the trek back to Henderson often. Next time you are in the mood for pizza, give them a try."}
{"text":"Last night was the most embarrassing and probably the worst experience I have ever had in all of the 15 years I have been living in Henderson. To clarify to everyone out there I have been a steady customer of E strings for almost 10 years. My daughter had even taken guitar lessons back when they had first opened. Monday night at about 9 pm. I had just gotten there and sat down when I asked the bartender of whom I did not recognize for a drink. This bartender stated loudly in front of all the customers there that I was 86 from there and refused to serve me. I asked whatever for?????? She stated that I was stealing tips from the bar.. Im like what ????? I was appalled at her accusation and as hard as it was, restrained my emotions and calmly replied to her that she must have me mixed up with someone else. She insisted she was right and continued to embarrass me in front of everyone. Inside I was seething and thinking to myself does anyone not train there bartenders in professional communication anymore. Now realizing her mentality and being a woman with integrity and one who has never taken anything off of anyone I demanded to see the owner.I told the owner how I felt about her behavior and about being accused and attacked when I had done nothing wrong. He told me I could stay and I did for a while because I did not feel I should just up and skeedaddle even when I felt damn uncomfortable being there after wrongful behavior. WORST DAMN EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!  I intend to go back and get to the bottom of her behavior with the owner but for today I needed to put this out there as I feel degraded and let you know about one of the worst experiences of my life."}
{"text":"They deserve a half a star for service...took 30 minutes for my burger after I reminded her twice...not happy. She gave me no napkins. It wasn't worth the wait. I'm from Chicago but I will be sure to let people I know in Henderson, NOT to visit!"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to post this review for fear of making this place too popular. But this is absolutely the best pizza in Las Vegas. Yeah yeah everyone has their favorite. But this is the best. And they don't even know It. Better than naked city and Joe's on paradise."}
{"text":"The kitchen is under new management and the food is amazing! The taste speaks volumes because its quality! I highly, highly recommend this place. Out with the old and in with the BEST in town!"}
{"text":"The band, Locomotives plays here once a month and it is hoppin.  There are two seperate places, one bar area and the other restaurant/lounge."}
{"text":"I used to come here on Saturdays for the Jazz for a college course I was taking but stopped because I started working on the weekends. Recently I went there to kill time on a weekday so it was pretty dead. Still, I got to meet a few people and have a couple drinks. I had the BLT and it was pretty good. 
I think I spent a little less than $20 for two Blue Moons and a BLT plus the tip.

Overall the place is nice. It's small, but not claustrophobic. The people who I'm assuming are regulars are nice and welcoming. 
Some of the booths could use a renovation, and the bathroom had a stall and urinal out of order when I went. 

4/5 will go again..."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! We celebrated my husband's 40th birthday here and had an absolute BLAST!! The food is amazing and the staff is on point!! If you haven't tried this place, you're really missing out!!"}
{"text":"They have live music occasionally.  It's a small room so it's obviously various local acts.  I happened to see a beatles cover band composed of high school students.  They were pretty good actually.

The food I've seen is pretty sub par.  I got a pizza once, it was thin and greasy.  Hot wings were really wet if I recall correctly.  Don't go here for the food.

The bar is in a separate area, thus the show I went to was an all-ages show which is nice.  Even though I'm well over 21 years old, I remember when I wasn't.  Its a shame to miss out on music because others are drinking."}
{"text":"The place is fun with a group of friends. It has 2 sections or rooms. The first is the bar area with a long bar and some tables along the walls. The second is like a dance hall with a stage. It was setup for karaoke when I went so not sure if they use the space for other things during the week. The drink prices were decent and everyone seamed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"Hey!!! If you wanna lose your buzz, AFTER tipping a bunch, to be skipped and hear the same people over and over... Go here. Good times. The Friday-Saturday KJ is awful. Nobody at our table got to sing, after tipping $5 each, and waiting an hour."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of a late night karaoke place. Food is good, crowd is chill, Andrea keeps your plates and cups full, & Brian works in the kitchen & will offer you bread if your drunk self needs to soak up the booze after the kitchen closes (my only criticism is their kitchen closes too early). A fun place to sing whatever karaoke songs you want. Hosts are cool... And if you can't stand karaoke, there's a separate bar/pool area (cue not suit). Fun local hangout."}
{"text":"This is dive bar karaoke at its finest. I've been to several karaoke bars in Vegas and E-Strings is my favorite by far. They start karaoke at 9 on every night except Sunday which is great. There's enough of a crowd that you don't feel like you're singing to yourself but the wait to sing is never too terrible. Cheap drinks. All in all everything I look for in a karaoke spot."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a drink if price is your concern. Food menu is slim and nothing was that good. We ordered:
sweet potato fries - good flavor, a bit limp, nice honey dip
onion rings - crispy, fried part fell off of the onions
spinach artichoke dip - liked the taste of it but there were HUGE artichoke chunks that were too big to eat

Popular place for karaoke, or at least it sounded like it."}
{"text":"My friends and I frequently come to e string for karaoke because we love the atmosphere and happy hour prices. Tonight, a Tuesday, we've gotten the biggest group of friends together to the place, only to be informed by the bartender that karaoke is only on thursday through Saturday. No notice, just walked in with a bunch of friends ready to sing and drink, and then the biggest let down I've ever had by an establishment in a very long time. Its hard to coordinate schedules with friends and it was the best to have the option for karaoke any day of the week. Now we're restricted. It is just such a bummer because I love this place and I would like karaoke to come back to every day. One star until then."}
{"text":"I hate to rate it so low but here's what you should know: The pizza is delicious... that's it. We don't stay because the place reeks of smoke. Based on the smell, I guess it's more bar than pizzeria. So we always take it to go. But service has been getting slower and slower. The last time we decided to get food here... it's been over an hour and we're STILL waiting. I was rooting for this place."}
{"text":"I love this place and my review for it is long overdue since I am a semi regular. I love coming here and just hanging out. They have a bar area, pool/dart area and then of course, my beloved karaoke room. They even have a quaintly lit patio area by the bar for nights when it is not freezing cold outside.
The bartenders here are friendly, easy going and serve quickly. The bar also has amazing happy hour prices, I think after 11pm or so? and the drinks are stupidly cheap, which is good and bad because it makes it all the easier to get shit faced, as I have a time or two here. 
The pool tables are tables with pool balls and pool sticks nearby. What else would you expect? They're only a dollar a game, but if you don't have quarters go get change at the bar. 
The karaoke room is where it's at! There are a few rickety tables (they literally wobble- I do not recommend sitting at one of said booths and slamming your drink/hand/phone/etc. down because you will most likely spill your drink everywhere as I have done a time or two). The booths are comfy but for the love of all things semi intelligent- please do not sit in one if you are there alone. Because if you do I am going to seat myself and my friends there with you because that's a fucking waste of room. The TV monitor things broke some what so now the audience can't follow along with the lyrics as people sing, which is great for when you casually change/fuck up the lyrics, no one will know! But the one the singer needs obviously still works. The KJ, Paul who is usually there, is the coolest dude. He's super nice, pretty funny, and does a badass \"Going to California\" cover. Definitely a cool guy worth over tipping. Other KJs include Redd, who is cool if it's still 1996, and Big Black Teddy, who is such a sweetie and a baller mofo for screamo songs, as well as any other things (he did Adele on Friday, even though no one wanted to cry at karaoke). 
All in all, great venue. Karaoke usually starts around 9:30/10pm after the houseband wraps up and it's usually pretty full of people on the weekends. It's always a fun place to go to though, whether to meet people, get drunk, watch other people get drunk, listen to karaoke-rs or sing yourself, it's a place to visit for sure!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delish, crust was airy and light.  Sauce was tasty and seemed like it cooked all day.  I do think it is over priced, sorry to say.  I just can't fathom ordering a pizza to go and paying almost 30 bucks out the door.  My family eats pizza usually once a week so probably not going to be a regular."}
{"text":"It's a cool bar drinks are fairly priced. Just don't gamble there the lady said you can only have one beer for every $20 you spend. Spent fifty bucks got two beers I could have bought a few more drinks  for fifty bucks but like I said it's a cool bar pool table everything like that"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you'd like to end up in the hospital due to alcohol poisoning. They won't cut you off. Ever. No matter how belligerent or near death you are. Kill yourself or someone else in a car accident? It's cool. As long as the bartender gets that tip money! 
If you're looking for a place to find girls past a level of intoxication that's safe, this is the place! 
Or a place with a bunch of drunk douche bags that should have been cut off hours ago, and are now fist fighting, this is the place! 
Safety is the least of the bartenders worries they just want your money , there isn't security beyond 12am , and the owners aren't ever around. 
Great place to make a snuff film?"}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night with a few of my friends for karaoke. I ordered a drink at the bar..a long island to be precise. The bar tender fixed my drink. After which I handed him my bank card. He got loud with me telling me the card machine was broken and I had to get cash from the ATM. I asked why he hadn't told me that before I ordered my drink. He grabbed the drink after I told him I wasnt going to get money out of the cash machine. He proceeded to tell me he was going to drink it after he got off work. Good for you buddy!!! The thing is I wasnt looking for a free drink...it was how he handled it that was bothersome. At least one drunk patron thought it was funny and laughed at me. Seriously...for a long island icetea in a freakin plastic cup. I hadn't been to this bar in 3 years because I moved away to a different part of town. I insisted my friends come join me there Saturday because it is a good bar. After my experience with the bar tender...we left and went to the PTs on sunset...we ate...we drank...we enjoyed karaoke and pool. The bar tender was great...for my $15 worth of happy hour drinks...I tipped him $25."}
{"text":"Good drink prices and a good layout that divides bar and showroom. The nachos are pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Local bar and pizzeria. Huge wall projector with adjacent TV's for sports viewing, accommodating to big groups. Live jazz and karaoke on select nights. Friendly staff. Pizza menu comes with a selection of 20+ options, to include a few vegetarian-friendly. Large size pizza came with 8 large slices at $24. Handmade, fresh ingredients, and flavorful pizza."}
{"text":"The bartender who looks like Newman on Seinfeld refused to give us waters after three different people from our party asked separately, and after we had bought three overpriced pitchers of beer. Thumbs down for service, but thumbs up for karaoke singers."}
{"text":"All the Bartenders are awesome to hang out with! The gaming is great, hit a royal here the first time I sat down. Stayed for the comedy show on Sunday, and had a blast!"}
{"text":"Live jazz every Saturday which is awesome.  1-4pm. 

The food is decent but can take an excruciatingly long time if the place gets busy because it seems they never have more than 2 people on staff at any one time. 

Service is hit and miss.  Not especially professional but it's essentially a tavern so you get what you get."}
{"text":"I have several friends who have been coming to E-String for years for karaoke.

I'm pretty die hard for one karaoke company here in town, so I don't venture out to other karaoke joints often...I feel like I'm cheating on a lover!

So Friday night, my fella and I were all excited to head out to karaoke, when we found out the place we wanted to go doesn't have karaoke on Friday nights anymore!  For SHAME!!
So we asked around, and I remembered that E-String has karaoke every night of the week.

When I got there, about 9:15, it was pretty slow, but by 10:30pm, the place was packed!  The bar and the karaoke area were completely full, and the queue to sing was about 30 people long!  I haven't been to a busy karaoke place like this in ages!

So, let me tell you about the KJ, Paul.  

He was great.  He's got a great system that displays the next 3 singers on the screen, as well as announcing who is next, that way you don't miss your turn.  
He has a HUGE selection of songs, including some Imelda May that is hard to find.  

Sound was good.  Not the best I've heard at a karaoke bar, but the acoustics in the room are a little wonky too.  

He was really fair with the queue, and like any host, if you tip, you can get moved up a bit.  

The bartenders were great.  Super friendly, and the drinks were strong, and pretty cheap too.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone, including the other guests, is so nice and welcoming.

I usually only go for karaoke, and my favorite DJ is AC. His nights are Wednesdays to Saturday's. I don't know what the other person is talking about, but when it gets really busy, the wait to sing a song can get up to over an hour. If you want to sing sooner, actually tip the dj. That's how the DJ makes money, and not many people tip well, so if you consistently tip nicely, you won't have to wait AS long as say the other people (like me) who don't tip at all.
And don't be an ass. Assholes probably have to wait longer than everyone else.

I'm only saying all of this as someone who's lived in Vegas forever and actually understand that people are generally nicer to you if you're not an asshole and tip well.

Sonny, the bartender is awesome too. I only met Jenn once but she's sweet and she made this delicious drink that I drank for the rest of the night and then I got really drunk.

Fun times."}
{"text":"This is a great locals bar with very fair prices on draft beers and friendly bartenders. Also the karaoke room is very fun and entertaining. The slots were surprisingly very loose and I ended up winning a good amount of money. Did not try the pizza because by the time I wanted to order the kitchen was closed but definitely want to try it next time.I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The new pizzeria inside E-string is phenomenal. The crust is some of the best I've ever tasted. So glad there's finally a good spot near us."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten there yet, but I'm looking forward to it soon...karaoke every night, but the follow the traditional scheduling of starting at 9 pm....I'm an old alticucker (Yiddish for person) and although I can still drive in the dark, I don't want to."}
{"text":"Wonderful karaoke bar! E-String has an awesome song selection, great drinks, and delicious food. E-String is one of our favorite places to go, whether just hanging out with friends, a birthday celebration, or even getting engaged! My now husband proposed May 2015 by singing to me and then asking me to marry him. All our friends and family were there and it was a wonderful night. E-String helped make it very special"}
{"text":"Andrea was very helpful and knowledgeable. There menu is mostly Pizza: so we got one! It was an overwhelming size at first, but we ended up eaten the whole pie! Definitely quality pizza made with amazing ingredients!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated so poorly at any local bar in my life.  We (my friends and I ) live in the area and like to have a local friendly place for all of us to meet in a centralized location.  Most of my friends love to sing karaoke, enjoy live music and we all love to dance and have a great time. Paul the karaoke host a great and amazing with the crowd. Jennifer has been a great bartender and always checks in with all her costumers. But TIM the late bartender has always been less the professional and straight out rude and disrespectful. We have actually seen him motion negative physical actions towards us many times.  We have even approached him about it, as if we have done something inappropriate. All of us are working professionals in other local businesses and some of us live in walking distance of this bar.  Sorry to say even after speaking to some of the other local guests about this professional behavior they said they just \"deal with him.\"  Well, we will not just deal with it.  WE WILL NEVER go back to this place and be sure to tell everyone we know not to go there either.  Bye E String Bar and Grill, we will take our business and self respect to one of the many local bars in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The words to describe this pizza escapes me, almost. The pies are a traditional NY style.  The ingredients are top shelf with cheeses imported from Italy as well as double zero flour. The meat choices are pepperoni or salami. Tomatoes are San Marazano also imported.  Pies are hand tossed to order, so pizza may take a little longer to come. Consider it a wise investment of your time the explosion info fresh taste that will roll over your palate. 

If you can't tell I'm a little in love with this, and by little if I had to choose between this pizza and my wife, it would be a choice I thought about for a minute or ten.  In the NY tradition the slices fold perfectly to make a delicious pizza sandwich.  

The service equals the pizza.  Our waitress Andrea was quick and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, anything she didn't know she asked the chef about instead of guessing."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool place with a whole mixture of different people. They have happy hour with good prices late at night. The jukebox is good and they have karaoke, which is always fun to watch!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings! I really like this place, karaoke every night. We went on a Wednesday and it wasn't to busy. Good service, would go back."}
{"text":"Karaoke here is a joke. Well, let me specify that the karaoke DJ is a joke. The system they have (electronic database with tons of songs to pick) is fantastic. Could be a great time. BUT, when you go up to sing a song, the DJ back in his little booth also has a microphone and does not hold back even the slightest if he wants to sing a long with you. It turns into a duet... Actually more of a song battle. 

If that's not annoying enough, He'll live at random times to go hang out in the bar area, leaving the people that were supposed to be singing stuck on stage looking like fools as they wait for their song to start. 

The bar portion is decent. They have Mirror Pond on tap which is fantastic. But I come for the karaoke, which means I won't be coming anymore."}
{"text":"Went to check out Bruce Harper's Big Band.  What a treat!  16 piece big band full of professional players.  It's not often you get to hear this genre live and it's such a refreshing change from the Vegas Lounge cover band that uses backing tracks.  We'll be back to see this band for sure!  The place was understaffed so I wouldn't recommend going to one of these afternoon shows hungry - it was at least an hour wait for our meal and another 10-15 minutes waiting on the check.  The server was friendly and apologetic."}
