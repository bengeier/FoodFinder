{"text":"Great little shop for bubble tea. They have many flavours and toppings. They also had Jamaican patties. Price is cheap, a regular taro slush with tapioca cost $4.75. They also only accept cash or debit and you get a stamp card to collect beverages to earn a free one."}
{"text":"Legit mom and pop shop specialising in juice, shakes and bubble tea. They have some exotic fruit on hand.   Their soursop shakes are great. My favourite is the soursop and mango. The sugarcane juice with a hint of ginger is a very good combo too.  My family and I come here every chance we get when we're all back in Brampton."}
{"text":"The owners are very sweet people, Raymond and Vanessa. The drinks are fresh, delicious and healthy. Perfect for warm days and after a work out. Most of the restaurants and fast food places in the plaza do not offer that many healthy options so Real & Yummy is a great alternative.  Although I have only tried their real fruit and veggie smoothies I haven't tried their bubble teas yet. I work at an academy a few doors down and all my students have raved how great their bubble tea are.  Prices aren't too expensive. If you buy a number of drinks you can receive one medium drink for free if you have their stamp card!  There is usually one server so there tends to be a line up, expect to wait a couple minutes. Luckily they have a TV that features YouTube videos throughout the day to keep you entertained."}
{"text":"This had become my favorite juicery in the Brampton east area. The customer service is impeccable and there's a stamp card system! I love that the vegetables are kept cold so you're not just paying for half a glass of ice and some juice but 100% juice. They even have options to add protein and such. Love it!"}
{"text":"So now that the place is running, customer service is gone. Asked for no ice, he still did. N when I asked for ginger n lemon juice to be separate in one cup he became a lil rude. So not sure what to say but not visiting again"}
{"text":"I have to agree with others that the owners are really nice people who are completely hands on and involved with getting a good cup of fruit juice or boba tea.  This place is outside central GTA so it's not convenient to most but for those in northern Brampton, this is a great spot.  The place is clean, sparse, and take out focused.  In addition to the typical milk and green tea blends, you do have the choice of pureed juices or even vegetable based ones.  I decided to verve from my usual favourite black milk teas and go all in for the fruit.  For only a $1 more than a large milk tea, I got large scoops of fresh mango and sour sop fruit blended up with a touch of condensed milk and then a nice big scoop of bubbles to go with it.    I would say my fruit drink was good... not watery at all and they kept the ice to a minimum so it was filled with more fruit.  I did feel the boba was a bit mushy so a touch over cooked but the fact I can get a big nice fruit drink for only $1 more is a great steal.  I think with the kind owners and great drink, everyone living beside the cow fields in Northern Brampton has a wonderful spot for boba drinks and juices (healthy or not!)"}
