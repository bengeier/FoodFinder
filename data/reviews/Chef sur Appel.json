{"text":"The moment I set food in the restaurant, I can tell It was one of those \"we sell cheap because it's cheap\" places that try to look student friendly by rounding up the numbers to look pretty. I entered with two of my friends and, being more experienced (and cheap I guess) than my two companions, I didn't order anything.  The guy was thoroughly disappointed by the quantity of the food for 10$ (3 chicken tenders and some fries) while the girl had to skip class the next day due to a ferocious battle with her intestines.  I swiped some the fries and they were soggy and tasteless.  Prices: 2/5 (not worth it for the quantity) Food: 1/5 (disgusting fries) Selection: 3/5 (average menu, nothing spectacular) Decor: 3/5, it's dirty (table was sticky too) and in a basement but I liked the drawings on the black board.  You're better off walking less and go to Charcoals or walking in the other direction and going to Poulet Bronze/King Kebab."}
{"text":"Burgers are the best so juicy and delicious  Lots of sauce and curly fries are just perfect If you check in they give you free sauce, what can be better"}
{"text":"Tiny basement resto/ delivery, just opened, still finding its feet.  The place looks a bit rough for wear, don't know what was here before; only 4 tables (2 tables put together in a row), the last can't be used because that's  where all the condiments are prepared and napkins, straws etc are stored in plastic bins.   I ordered a crispy chicken burger, which came with fries and a choice of ether water or a can of soft drink. I chose bottled water, the chicken was indeed crispy, servred  in a bun with iceberg (yuck) lettuce and tomato. This came in a paper-lined basket,with spiced mayo on the side. The food was good, not super, service surprisingly quick and the prices are all between $10-$13, comparable to most of the burger/sandwich joints downtown."}
