{"text":"The food was decent, but the service is absent. It took us 30 minutes to get waters, another 45 minutes to get our sangria, and another 1.25 hours to get our food. We had to ask several times for the items we already ordered. There were only 3 other tables filled in the whole restaurant. Wasted my time."}
{"text":"A nice comfortable atmosphere and the high ceilings made the room feel larger.  The eggplant with vegetables topped off a good evening out."}
{"text":"Service peu agréable. Au moment du dessert, il manquait la glace qui accompagnait, elle est arrivée 20 minutes plus tard sans une excuse de la part de la serveuse.  La nourriture était correcte mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Service: beyond awful Food : average if I am being nice  Went here for dinner with my wife. Unfortunately we didn't have dinner together since the waitress brought the wrong meal for my wife.  Rather than take both away the standard today is to offer a free dessert. They don't have a great dessert menu.  So I ate my grilled calamari by myself. Thick chewy with an average sauce.  And the ubiquitous pickled antipasto.  It was everywhere.  Finished my meal and it was my wife's turn to eat. She had raved about this ravioli dish. When I tasted it, I thought here insane.  And she wondered if she dreamt the last time she was there. Best of all when she was finished the waitress handed my wife the dessert menu and left the dirt plate on the table.  The charcuterie platter was average.  4 slices of average cheese. Some cold meat and some antipasto.  Want to waste your money, eat here."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday-restaurant had only 2 people serving.  They put stale bread on the table and 1 hour later our food was still not ready! We  left without eating! Waste of time- definitely a do not recommend!!!Amici is badly run restaurant! They ruined our Saturday night family dinner."}
{"text":"Great Italian food in Pickering. Ambiance is lovely, service is quick and friendly. They accommodated me by using my own vegan cheese that I brought with me to make the pizza I ordered from their menu. Good portion sizes and food was delicious. Very nice place, and prices quite reasonable. Definitely will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"A lovely restaurant with great food, wonderful waitstaff and perfect outdoor seating. The menu is in French, but if you ask nicely the waiters are very helpful in translating to English. I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and basil and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"It is really nice to have a scratch kitchen (fresh food prepared) and an Italian restaurant in Pickering.  About two years ago, I had dinner here and ate some veal and I really enjoyed my meal. However, my dining companions had less than satisfactory experiences so I thought ... let the review wait, try again. So I did it, and went there on my own for lunch. The waitress, observing that I was a single diner, thoughtfully asked if I would prefer a quiet table by the window or a bar seat. I chose the quiet table. Musing over the menu, I really felt like ordering gnocci, or a pasta dish, or arancini, but I decided to give the pizza a try. I was torn between the Funghi and the Amici. I asked the waitress for advice, and she said that the Amici is \"the popular choice\", so I went with it. Well, it was a bit bland for my taste. However, it was undeniably Neapolitan in style (goo-ey cheese middle with a nice pile of arugula, surrounded by a crisp crust), and the free bread that came with it gave me the opportunity to try out the oils that are at the table, which were really tasty. I now know that I am not the biggest fan of Neapolitan style pizza, and I should have followed my initial instincts on this and gone with a pasta. However, if you love Neapolitan pizza and a restaurant with a soothing ambience, then Romeo, here is your Juliet.  I will be back to try their pasta and veal selections. This is a surprisingly high-end restaurant (OK, pricey by Pickering standards, but on par with anything of that quality in Toronto) located in an obscure location opposite the Go-Train Parking and the Liverpool Exit to the 401. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"If you are looking to try a good pizza resto in the little Italy area then Amici is the place to try. This recently opened resto offers thin crust wood oven pizza. As soon as you enter the two floor resto one can't help but marvel at it's beautiful modern decor accented with a red theme. Along the walls are pretty picture frames with pics from different italian landmarks. Traditional italian music also sets the tone for a cozy warm restaurant.  This resto is perfect for a romantic date, special occasions or simply a night out with friends. Their portions are quite generous. We truly enjoyed their pizza's which were light thin crust and tasty!"}
{"text":"I wish  I could give it a higher rating, but it was overall disappointing.  No one really liked their food. I sent mine back. My father in law managed an Italian restaurant for years and didn't eat the pasta that came with his veal parmesan. We've had better at home. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner prompted an immediate review!  We came here with my parents to celebrate both Mother's Day and my Dad's birthday. The restaurant was packed, as one would expect on Mother's Day, but we planned ahead and had made a reservation.   I had toiled over their menu prior to coming. With so many delicious sounding items, it's hard to make a decision! I had my decision down to two items but when I walked in the door, I read the specials board and my pre-planning went out the window!!  I opted for the seafood special which was atlantic salmon and lobster tail with scalloped potatoes, roasted root vegetables and green beans with a tarragon cream sauce. Absolutely fantastic.   The salmon and lobster were cooked perfectly and the tarragon sauce was amazing. Both of these were perched on top of cheesy scalloped potatoes and surrounded with the vegetables.   The presentation was fabulous the flavour was fabulous and in fact, one of the best meals I've had in a long time.   Even though the restaurant was filled to the rafters, our server was quick, friendly and attentive.   Everything about our experience tonight was great and I know we will definitely back soon!"}
{"text":"The pasta here always hits the spot! The only problem with the menu is that there are too many tasty options.. My favourite is the manicotti di ricotta! My, my... And the service is great! I'm becoming quite the regular here to be honest. Don't skip out on dessert! Tiramisu with a coffee for me;)"}
{"text":"We found out it was Pizza Week in Montreal, so we immediately looked up places to try a pizza at. Amici happened to be right near us while we were in Little Italy. The restaurant is clean, well-kept, has some what of a upscale look to it. The pizza was decent, nice crispy thin crust. We weren't on a budget or anything, but I was shocked with how pricey their pizzas were in comparison to many of the other restaurants in the area. Also - not offering glass by the wine is a huge turn-off for me. Especially when your bottles are $40-60 (CAD). Other than that, not a bad place to stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good for a joint in Pickering! Many of these alike in downtown Toronto, but great food and decent service.   Wood oven pizza YAS. You can really taste it and the spicy olive oil they have at each customer table is bomb. Nothing like I've ever tasted before.  I found that during lunch time, the service gets quite diluted, but they are very nice and you can tell they are doing their best with the lunch rush.  I would recommend the pizzas and pasta; not too much that it will give you the post-lunch slump after going back to work, but enough it will keep you powering on til the end of the day.   I would definitely come here again for the food. Perhaps get more staff during the busy hours?"}
{"text":"HUGE ITALIAN FOOD FAN! (but who isn't...) I'm in Pickering fairly often and this time I was just hunting down something to fill that craving. Food comes in generous portions, but I think the price is a bit steep and the service was not so great.. The waitress serving the table next to us would look at us as we waved at her, and just made a face and walked off. But when she talked to her own table, it was all chatty cathy and \"omgosh\"-es.... if you're working in a restaurant, I'm not asking you to serve all the tables, but guests don't always know that you are assigned certain ones. You could just say \"i'll get your server\". I dont think I've ever been upset with service from someone who WASN\"T serving our table.. Our server though, honestly... she was MIA most the night.. Luckily the hostess comes around helping to set tables and she's happy to help us get some water & call our waitress on over. The servers seriously seemed to be struggling.. it's a full restaurant, plenty of staff... but seemingly no organization?   Anyway. onto the food. We had the pizza with goat cheese which we thought was very nice. It's a big size and there's a thin crust, so that makes me an automatic fan. I ordered the fettuccine with a pistachio based sauce. It tasted amazing, but I will say it was a touch salty and the oils were really heavy. If you're not someone who often eats heavy meals or uses much oil in their cooking, this might be a over loaded meal. But give it a try and see for yourself! Tons of my fellow Yelpers really enjoyed their experience here, so it might just be worth the trip for you. I would come back to try it again, but maybe not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal here last night. Authentic Italian. Don't be fooled by the outside, it's huge inside. By 7 pm there was a lineup out the door for a table. Lots of families but not loud. Servers were fantastic. I'm a carnivore and my wife is a vegetarian and lots of options for both of us. The house Italian vin rosso is much better than the Ontario vin rouge. The spaghetti and meatballs is delish and the gnocchi is really good too, although if you don't like the bite of Gorgonzola ask for a red or alfredo sauce."}
{"text":"This might have been the fastest sit-down restaurant that I have ever experienced in my life! We dined at Amici at around 7pm on a Sunday night. We opted to eat in the lounge, where a medium-sized group and a handful of other couples were also eating. The service was incredibly prompt! Right after we ordered our meals, the server came with some starter bread & butter (which was great with the olive oils/balsamic vinegar). We were just finishing our last bite of the starter bread when our meals arrived.  I ordered the Penne Con Pollo and it was very good. The \"red pepper cream sauce\" is more of an Alfredo sauce with little red pepper flakes. The grilled chicken and spinach make this dish great.   Overall, I would recommend Amici for a little taste of Italy in Pickering/Durham Region. My only critique is for this restaurant to offer more variety on their menu (pastas and pizzas are great, but if they extended their Panini menu past 4pm, it could be even greater.)"}
{"text":"I live very close to here but have never stopped in until tonight, for a quick dinner with a friend. We were greeted promptly and offered a choice of tables in the lounge or dining room. Both looked nice but we chose the dining room with its lower seating.  Our server took our orders and brought us some freshly baked bread. It was perfect with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I ended up eating most of it because I was starving!  My friend ordered the Fusilli Con Salsiccia (house made sausage, herbed tomato, pepperoncino, rapini, roasted garlic, olive oil). She said it was a little salty which I thought might have been the sausage. She took home half of it because it was a very generous serving.  I ordered the Lasagna (Layers of pasta, ground beef, mozzarella, asiago, parmesan and tomato sauce). It was pretty good and quite filling. There were no leftovers. I did say I was starving.  The ambiance was nice and I can imagine it getting cozier after the sun goes down. The service was good and the prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"My best friend from LA was craving for some italian food. She picked this place on Pickering which is off of the 401 near Pickering town center. This place on a Saturday is definitely bumping, so if you want a table make sure you make a reservation. We were a group of three so we didn't have to wait (less than 5 minutes). We ordered calamari for apps to share - super delicious and decently portioned. For our mains, my friend and I ordered pasta, while my boyfriend ordered lasagna! The pasta was a tad salty but it had great flavor and taste to it. My boyfriend said that the lasgna    was \"meat\" his standard (what a punny guy!) If your in the area, come drop by for some home style Italian food you won't regret"}
{"text":"Came here with my niece and for a restaurant in pickering it's pretty good.  The place inside has a pretty nice setup.    We got some free bread which came right of the oven. It was the bomb with the melted butter.  I got an avocado salad and my niece got a lasagna. Portions were good and food was good too.  I'd come back for sure."}
