{"text":"just tried this restaurant for the first time and I'm really impressed. food is very fresh and staff is very pleasant and informative. wife and I are very impressed. we WILL be back! portions seem to be pretty good in size. this is going to become a weekly spot for us!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants we have ever eaten at. Service was great but the food is even better. We had the Kalbi and the seafood tofu, both are delicious. The side dishes compliment the purple rice perfectly, we left there very happy customers, will definitely be back next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"It was delicious. Our waiter helped us get find good food. The tofu hotspot was good so was the Dumpling soup. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for home made Korean food, this place is IT. The taste is very nice and they claim they don't have MSG in all of their dish, which is true in the dish that we ordered. The price is a little bit pricey, but not too expensive. The place is setup like a cafe style, not like a restaurant. The condiments are all like home made. I love it. 

They just opened for 8 months at the time of the writing of this review."}
{"text":"excllent food with tradtional korean family run flare. tremendous service with home made condaments and real genuine service. rivals k-town food with affordable prices."}
{"text":"If you are looking for more authentic traditional Korean look no further. The Bulgogi marinate was amazing!"}
{"text":"Hadn't heard to much about this place and stumbled onto one night when looking for a place to eat.

It smelled pretty bad when I first walked in....but don't worry it's just the smell of daikon...which is a good thing. Only other people in the restaurant were Koreans, which gave me some confidence that the meal would be authentic. 

I was not let down. This place produces some great home style Korean cuisine. 

Banchan is fantastic. So was the tofu soup (I forget the proper name) and every other dish we ordered.

Surprised this place hasn't blown up with popularity yet"}
{"text":"This was a casual food spot. The service was friendly and attentive. I got the Kimchi pancake and spicy seafood soup. Kimchi pancake was deliciously crunchy and the soup was legitimately spicy (thank God). All the dishes had great flavors, everything tasted fresh, it was like eating a homemade meal. What was particularly endearing was that the chef came out to greet us and ask how the food was. You can tell she really cares when making your food."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews, I enjoy the food here. It's a clean restaurant, fairly priced, small menu, but you get some home cooking dishes only a Korean Mom knows how to make. I spoke with the chef and she told me she teaches cooking. You can tell because the food and flavors are well executed. I wouldn't say strong over seasoned, but simple, clean, and deliciously prepared. I will be back to try other dishes. Loved that the banchan included potato salad and the rice was multigrain rice (Japgokbap) good stuff!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Kkulmat? Well we wanted to try this place as soon as we passed by the first time.
After the first visit we've become regulars here and it's now our go to spot!

The favorites here are the old noodle and the spicy pork bulgogi!
And can't forget about their fried ice cream!
The girlfriend loves the cold noodles and says the Kalbi is amazing!!

10/10 would recommend for anyone to come here and try!
Their service is spot and everyone here is always so nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I took my dad here to get lunch. Hot pot bibim bap was amazing I got to excited too take a picture before eating it!"}
{"text":"I was there was my family a few weeks ago, finally had time to write a review. It's a nice little restaurant, the food was good, staff was friendly and courteous, and the price was competitive among other Korean restaurants. What I didn't like was how it was set up, it didn't feel inviting but my daughter wanted Korean food. We ordered 3 Bibimbab, that was delicious. Love the various kimchi, soup, and various small dishes of food served with your entree. The food was good. The menu is a little small but we knew what we wanted to eat. Overall it wasn't bad, good service and good food."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick take out order while still at J Karaoke. My friend had been raging about the mandu saying they are pretty legit and similar to what we had in Korea in spring 2016. We had arrived at like 10:40-10:45 and was told they were closed with last call being at 10:30. I took that as the kitchen was closed at 10:30 but i guess my friend took it was the dining room was closed and asked if take out was possible. They answered yes. 

We ordered 1 order of the mandu's - half kimchi, half normal pork. Each order comes with 10 dumplings. The dumplings came out in like 10 minutes. We took it back to karaoke before we ate it. The dumplings were nice and hot. The dipping sauce it comes is nice and balanced. Not too sweet/salty. 

The dumplings were nicely pan seared. Its nice to see someone do it properly and not deep fry the entire thing or steam it. The size were pretty good. Not as filled as what is made at home but much more than most places overall. 

I could easily eat a few orders of these dumplings. They are nice and flavorful. It's kind of hard to distinguish between the normal pork vs pork and kimchi but they were both equally yummy. The dumpling skin isn't too thick which is nice. I'd almost say they are more manufactured skins vs homemade. 

Would love to come back and try other dishes in the future"}
{"text":"Authentic and family run ... Mom cooks, daughter serves and husband brings out the banchan (side dishes). 

Very casual - not going for the ambiance, but going for food - easily some of the best Korean flavors in the states.  

Will be going back for sure ..."}
{"text":"Best home style cooking Korean food My family and I ve had in vegas:) highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, I can see that there is a bit of a discrepancy between the reviews. Maybe there other menu items are better but the BASIC stuff, like ddukbokki, ddukmandoo soup, al tang, and nengmyun were just..Ok. And when we went, no one greeted us, and the lady taking the order took forever to get to us, despite the fact that there was only one table there, who happened to be someone she knew. 

My cousins and I didn't want any of what they might call their specialty foods because portions were bigger so we ordered just everyday things and I don't think I'd choose to go back and probably would recommend other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"This place is very clean with authentic korean food! My husband and I tried the kimchi fried rice, pork dumplings, and kalbi...all were very delicious! I was afraid the kimchi fried rice was going to be too spicy for me but it wasn't at all! Didn't wanna share with my hubby at all! Also LOVED the mash potato side with walnuts and cranberry. Never had anything like that before and i couldn't stop eating it!!! Will definitely be back to Kkulmat!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Banchan was tasted homemade. Service was excellent! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hidden jewel in LV. Really authentic, home made korean food.   Definitely will come back.  Their fish roe stew was amazing."}
{"text":"I really hate to put a small business on the spot, especially on yelp because i do support a small mom and pop type of restaurants but i was very dissapointed with our food.
We got soybean paste soup  and it was such a disaster...it was so salty that i first  thought someone accidentally knocked a salt bottle into our soup.
 But i know the saltiness came from the soybean paste, not from salt, so it was very dissapointing.
I got a chicken stew which was on their special menu and it was good. So i think maybe their other food is not bad.
This place has 4.5 star but we were the only table on sunday 7 pm. Strangely empty."}
{"text":"Not like other places, this is a family run restaurant! All the food are so delicious. The service is also warm and sweet. I love their spicy beef soup, tonkatsu and rice cake! The portion size is so big that I cannot finish any of the dishes, so I take them home, and even the leftovers are still delicious. Highly recommend if you are craving for authentic Korean food!"}
{"text":"This place was really good !!! It is right next to sk seafood the Chinese restaurant. It took me a little to find it because google maps isn't updated yet with this restaurant. The portions are pretty big and shareable. I went for lunch with my boyfriend and his tofu soup was huge. I got the tonkatsu and it was good as well. The sauce comes on top and it isn't too sweet. I liked it. The side dishes were minimal, not too many. Two different kimchi dishes and a sour cucumber dish and some type of squash dish. The food is really good here guys! I definitely plan on coming back. The only reason I give four stars instead of five is because the menu wasn't that big yet. Not too much variety. Hopefully they get a bigger menu in the future!!"}
{"text":"I have been many many Korean Restaurants around the country and and this place its on top 3 list.
Me and my wife visit this place 2 times and both times we really like the food and the service.
I order the Mul-naengmyeon and taste was perfect. Many Korean places dosnt know how to make good Mul-naengmyeon.
Banchans where very tasty and high quality.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We initially came here to eat at the restaurant that was here before this but that place closed, and since every where else was so busy we decided to give this place a try. 

We had a party of 11 and it was clear that they are understaffed. Only one waitress in the front, and two ladies cooking in the back. Two more parties came in after us so they were all over the place. 

The waitress was very sweet and she tried her best but was very in-experienced. She took awhile to set up the table, bring out drinks and gave only 2 sets of sides (4 sides per set) for our entire party. 

We ordered 3 soups which came out pretty quickly, then one hot stone bibimbap came out then the other 6 took another 25 minutes to come out. 

Food is pretty good, tastes like other bibimbap, nothing unique. $10 for regular bibimbap and $12 for hot stone pot. 

Overall, food tastes good and service was decent. They just need more staff because the meal took almost 2 hours for just bibimbap and soup."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in town! Everything is very authentic, the chef always comes out to say hello to us, she's the sweetest woman! We have  the bibimbap every time we come and it's the best place in the city to get delicious authentic Korean food. Very clean, great service, we love this spot!"}
{"text":"This is arguably the best Korean restaurant in town. The portions are generous, fairly priced...and it's located at the heart of the city (minutes drive from the strip). I highly recommend it, for those seeking authentic Korean dishes."}
{"text":"This is a nice authentic Korean restaurant with good food, good service, and a full menu. It is impeccably clean and well-decorated. Great place to learn how incredible Korean food is."}
{"text":"Typical Korean. Which I really enjoy. I am so tired of Korean restaurants that sell BBQ. Don't get me wrong I like Korean BBQ, just not all the time. So if you are looking for a Korean restaurant from the old country, this it. Great service and lovely staff."}
{"text":"The food was very very good. The place is new so there is not much decorations but we decided to give it a try. We were not dissapointed with the food. The service was ok. You can tell theyre new in the business..We finally found a korean place just like the Hodori in K town LA. It tastes the same. The side dishes are few but you can ask for refill. We will definitely come back to this place.."}
{"text":"No Msg! Home made soybean and chili paste. Portions are enormous and the flavors are outstanding. We have ordered AL Jigae, Tonksu, and Jol Mandu. Except to have an empty stomach because the portions aren't like your typical Korean restaurants. We're talking 15+ pieces orncutlet, and and super size bowl for Jol Myun. The soup is outstanding as it has a thick soup base and the flavors kick in. No MSG. The side dishes are homemade. Mother cooking, feels like. Not a lot of side dishes however key point is simplicity (kimchi, potatoes salad, fish cake, pickle/kmichi) the owner is very knowledgeable in ingredients and  service. The food is at your table asap. She is proud of the food that is served and I can taste the flavors in each dish.

Very great!"}
{"text":"This place is family-run. I've enjoyed eating here 4 times in 2 months, and I really, really like their soondubu (I get it with beef, and *without* the dried seaweed seasoning on top). Their banchan dishes are very appealing and made with love and skill. The house steamed rice is a purple variety - just like the kind at the best Korean spots in Los Angeles.
 
The dining area of the restaurant is clean and roomy. No TVs, so it's not exactly a place to hang out, but it's a relaxing place to eat, catch up and talk with friends, and the service is great.

Welcome to Vegas, Kkulmat!"}
{"text":"Terrible taste... im Korean so I know how korean food taste like....this is probably the worst korean restaurant in Vegas. And their service was pretty awkward and blunt as well."}
{"text":"\"Because of your smile, you make life more beautiful.\" - Thich Nhat Hanh 

Heart-felt and made with love, home-cooked Korean food has a new home on West Spring Mountain!

Occupying the former So Good Cafe spot, Kkulmat is a clean, no-frills spot for Korean eats. The owners are two Koreans that share the kitchen responsibilities and knock out traditional dishes like Jjamppong, Bibimbab, Soondubu, Tteok-bokki, kalguksu, etc..

My love and I came in recently and really enjoyed the food.Their pan fried Mandu dumplings are made in house and worth taking note of...we had some in a Spicy Cold Noodle entree that were lovely. I also have a lot of love for the banchan. They brought out five items for us to share. They were all better than average, and I was a fan of the cucumber salad. Though simple, this dish paired well with the spicier items we were eating. The space is nothing to write home about though. Kkulmat reminded me of Island Style both in the approach to food, and also in setting, though Kkulmat is a little cleaner and more organized. This isn't a place you take a date to impress them, this is a spot you go for tasty, unabashed Korean dishes. 

It was slow while we were in and one of the owners came out of the kitchen...with a beaming smile she received our compliments, and I knew that this was someone's mom literally cooking for me. I didn't need to see her warm smile to know this, it was already evident in each bite of food, but the encounter accentuated the notion...and also cemented the fact that we will return for some more home-cooked style Korean food."}
{"text":"Not the best Korean food. Don't know why the other reviews rated it so high. Highly disappointed. Things were spicy but not flavorful. Maybe they haven't had really great Korean food to compare."}
{"text":"I believe this place is a hidden jewel. After a week of buffets, meats and rich desserts, we always go for Korean food to settle our tummies before catching our flight. 

There aren't too many Korean restaurants open for breakfast, breakfast being relative in Las Vegas, so after much searching found this little place. 

I've been leary about yelp's rating on food, since it's so political. Seems friends and family help get the ratings up because some of the places we've been to was only worth a laugh. 

However we were getting desperate to find a good place nearby when I read the review saying it was family owned and operated. GOOD CHOICE! 

Another yelper wrote that her bibimbap was good but not fancy. That's exactly what we wanted! Just a small FYI, bibimbap was originally just leftovers mixed with rice and gochu-jang. 

Anyway, it's a small mom and pop with clean open space filled with tables, chairs and window plants. A large open counter and the most smiley, sweet and efficient server. The menu is simple with pictures (for those not completely comfortable with Korean) 

The food is also simple, authentic Korean like my mom used to make. Every dish had their own distinct taste. The broth was deep and satisfying, we had yook-hwae jang. The price was outstanding, neighborhood joint range. Not the \"you're in Vegas\" range. 

All in all we will keep eating here for as  long as they are around and we keep coming to Vegas."}
{"text":"After work, i had a craving for tofu soup (which i always do ). Me and my boyfriend decided to try this new place. I must say they serve a very good kimchi which i even asked for a second serving. Tofu soup was good and tasty. We also had the steamed dumplings which you can ask half kimchi and half plane ones. Will go back to this place"}
{"text":"Interior is not really going with the business.
I'm guessing that the location was a cafe before
Anyway the interior really bothered me.
I had to see huge drawings of colorful tasty looking macarons while I was eating spicy rice cake, tteok-bokki.
And their price is on high side
BUT!
I've tasted Korean home food.
I ordered tteok-bokki and my wife ordered bibimbap.
Banchans were all nice.
However, servers were under trained."}
{"text":"When entering the place, some of the employees were nice and welcoming! I believe ordered the spicy seafood soup with ramyun! It was quite tasty along with some other dishes, but in all honesty this place was decent, nothing bad or extraordinary!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Just like a grandma who loves you and shows it through cooking food for you this tiny little restaurant has that same feel. Food is great, clean, ohhhh great place. Please come and support is place, this place is freaken great. Get the kimchi pancake damn it's good."}
{"text":"I came here for the hotpot bi bim bop (dolset bi bim bop) and it was excellent!  Nice mixture of ingredients in a sizzling bowl.  The chefs brought the the dishes out themselves and they kept cooking on the table.  I had the kimchi soup additionally which had lots of flavor and a tolerable spice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Best mandu (dumplings) I've ever had. It's a small place but service is great and food comes out pretty quickly. I wanted to try kimchi dumplings but they were out, so I had regular instead. Will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Thank you for Yelp ! We ended up trying this place out since the original place we went to was closed today but boy kkumlat did not disappoint ! We tried out their pan fried meat Mandu(dumpling) and spicy rice cake with ramen and it was so delicious ! The spicy rice was soft and chewy and has a good spicy kick. The mandu was so good we had to order another mandu ! They also make their mandus daily ! Yum ! We also order kimichi fried rice but we were so full we didn't even get to enjoy our fried rice.... maybe it will become our late night snack lol ! Our server was super friendly and fast. We will definitely come back again ! 

On Wednesday's their dumplings are 7.99 instead of 9.99 !"}
{"text":"Opened a couple of weeks ago, the Two lady chefs were gracious enough to visit our table and tell us their story and philosophy of their cooking. They are both from Busan which explains their culinary background. Their mission is to provide a home cooked meal without the use of MSG.  They are staffed in the back but only one of the chef's daughter was the sole waitress. This is their first outing as restaurateurs and it shows. What you get is definitely a family affair. 
Our party of 6 was seated but we had to help shuffle a couple of tables together.  
The food is on par with the other local Korean restaurants. However the shining star of the menu is the handmade mandoo dumplings. The mandoo did not skimp on the meat.  The soup as well was well stocked with large portions of beef. (However I didn't see any beef in the soup when I had takeout on my second visit. ) 
The sulang tang was equally generous on the beef. 
If you're in the mood for a down home, no nonsense home cooked Korean meal, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Kkulmtat Korean Kitchen doesn't have the popular BBQ griddles or smoke wafting about the room...what they have are clean tables, chairs, and two chefs in aprons cooking authentic Korean dishes...just like your mom's having fun cooking for you with her best friend.

We ordered
-Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup
-Spicy Cold Noodle with Pan Fried House-made Dumplings
-Kimchi Pancake 

The noodle soup had a clean taste with lots of seafood...I really loved the Udon noodles in it. My favorite dish of the evening though was the spicy cold noodles. The sauce for the cold noodles is Cho-Go-Choo-Jang, which is a red pepper paste with vinegar and seasoning. We asked for extra and covered all the components with this delicious and spicy sauce. The dumplings in this dish were almost perfect for my taste--the freshly prepared filling was the best I have had in Vegas.  The Kimchi Pancake was crispy in first bite but doughy and soft in the middle.

The banchan were better than you'd find in most Korean restaurants. I loved their cucumber salad and the julienne cut radish kimchi...two of my favorites. 

Kkulmat literally means honey taste, but in conversation, it describes something really delicious...and Kkulmat Kitchen stands by the name so well.  I will be sure to come back and try other offerings on the menu.

{"text":"This is a perfect little mom and pop restaurant on spring mountain. The owner was so nice and my boyfriend and I enjoyed our food a lot! We ordered the spicy tofu soup, bulgogi rice cakes, and a seafood udon. Everything was good, but it would be better if the rice cakes had a slightly thicker sauce. You can tell the flavors are very clean and tasted little of msg though (yay no dry mouth). The side dishes were also pretty good. The lotus roots had an amazing texture and the kimchi was also rich in flavor."}
{"text":"My bro was the one who found out about this place.. and I gotta say... I'm very glad he did! It's another Korean restaurant I can go to when I'm craving for something quick, authentic, and fresh.

Service was awesome and the staff was great. I didn't catch our server's name, but she was really nice. The restaurant itself is a casual sit down; not fancy at all. It is very clean and pretty spacious throughout. As for their menu, it is very simple and there's not much you can customize. I know some people prefer a more vast menu, but don't let a selective menu fool you. What I love about places with a very specific menu, is that you know they are the best at making just those items. ;] In most cases, they are chef specialties.

I have tried their spicy noodle bowl, spicy tofu soup, kimchi fried rice, and several other dishes. A must-try is their fried dumplings. They are homemade; and you can tell by the flavor and quality. You do have the option of ordering them steamed, but the fried one seems to be more popular.

I've became a regular here for good reason. I love authentic Asian food because, being Asian myself, I am pretty picky about how certain foods will live up to my expectations. So, if you are looking to have a casual meal that has authenticity, freshness, and flavor, I highly recommend this place. :]"}
{"text":"5/27/2017: The boyfriend and I were craving Korean food and decided to give this place a try after we found it on Yelp. I ordered mandu gook (rice cake and dumpling soup). My boyfriend ordered nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles). We also ordered a side of regular pan fried dumplings and kimchi dumplings. The waitress informed us that the dumplings are made in house. The side dishes were yummy and plentiful. We left full and happy. :) 

5/29/2017: We had to come back a second time around. I ordered the seafood kal-gooksu (knife cut noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the stone pot mixed rice (dolsot bibimbap). His meal came with a side of soup. Both of our dishes were delicious. We also ordered another plate of fried kimchi dumplings (it's a must!). The server informed us that they have daily $7.99 specials every day of the week. Wednesdays=dumpling day. Score! 

All in all, this place is a gem. Reasonably priced and comfort food. The atmosphere and service makes me feel like I'm home. I'll be back to order a plate of dumplings on Wednesday. I can't wait to try all the other dishes on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was really craving for some Kimchi Fried Rice while in Vegas and this spot was delicious!!! The workers were so polite and kind! They even placed our dishes nicely, so we can photography them. So sweet of them. I liked everything that I ordered here! Their side dishes were fresh! I ordered the kimchi fried rice and a bibimbap. The oxbone soup they give you with each rice dish was refreshing too! It was needed after a night of drinking. I love how they serve you the multi grain rice. So healthy! I'd come here again and recommend this to anyone in Vegas who wants authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"We had kalbi, pork tofu soup and yukgechang. It was all very tasty. Servers were very nice and place was small but clean. I would come back here definitely and try some others dishes."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and I'm glad I did. My friend and I both decided to come here for a late Saturday dinner. There were only a few people there that night. Probably why the lady working was very friendly and attentive to us. The place was clean and it had a nice, warm & homey atmosphere. The TV was playing K-pop videos which we didn't mind. Sorry no pics... but the food we ordered was unexpectingly good and we really enjoyed our dinner. We ordered the steamed dumplings , kimchi fried rice, bulgogi tteokboki and stone bibimbap. They were all very filling and flavorful. Side dishes was very good too- especially the spicy-sweet fish cake! I would have drank but they only had large bottles of Hite and Soju and my friend doesn't drink. It was worth trying this place and I will be back another time."}
{"text":"Today I ordered 4 different dishes for lunch to go for my staff in our office. Look what I got, 3 bowls rice in the  same box. The price are ridiculously high,$13 for a mandu soup that has not much of taste.
3 banchans in a tiny cup. 
It is not worth going back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant had amazing authentic Korean food. It is a super dive type of restaurant but don't underestimate the restaurant by its appearance, the food is fantastic! I got the spicy pork and it was great! Also try the fried dumplings, those were tasty! I am extremely satisfied with this restaurant and plan to come again! :)"}
{"text":"Tiny family style Korean restaurant. Decent size menu, simple decor and the servers are your usual Korean ladies. Didn't ordered much, can't really say how great the food was but from this one time I'm probably going to return to try more. Huge portions but kinda priced a bit high.  decide what spice level you want when ordering , I was smart enough to want less spice resulting in eatable food."}
{"text":"Truly authentic and delicious! My friend and I had dinner here last night.

The restaurant is quaint and cozy with TV showing Korean drama and music.

I learned everything is all made from scratch, fresh & tasty. The menu is simple with photos of each dishes. They are different from other Korean restaurant as they do not serve AYCE or BBQ but served homemade individual dishes which was exactly what I was looking for.

After we ordered, you are given 4 complementary side dishes. The food came out fast too.

We had Dumplings, Hot pot Bibimbab, Spicy Tofu seafood soup and Fish cake.

I personally love the Spicy Tofu seafood soup. The soup has octopus, mussel, tofu, shrimp and clams and an egg on the side to add it to the hot pot. If you like spicy I would recommend that.

The lady/owner was very friendly. Definitely will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I came here close to closing time and it's the perfect spot for late night food! The sides they give you are good and they are a great way to ease into your big meal. I ordered the bibimbap and it was really flavorful! However, I do wish that it had more meat. Overall it is a great establishment and their food is good and cheap!"}
{"text":"You might forget you're in the USA when you're eating this Korean food - the food here legitimately tastes like one of the common traditional Korean restaurants all over the streets of Korea. Talking to the owners - it makes sense. The family-owned restaurant features food made primarily by the front of the house's mother. She cooked in Korea for years making the same food she makes here. The kimchi is made from scratch and the dumplings are literally made by hand. While not EVERY single ingredient is made from scratch (like noodles), the flavors here are balanced and everything tasted exactly as expected.

Service was prompt and food came out surprisingly fast, but I can see how they can get overwhelmed if there was a large party. The front of the house speaks English quite well, so it is easy to ask about the food.

We managed to enjoy the Tteokbokki (rice cakes in spicy sauce with fish cake, onions, and cheese/ramen for an add-on), chicken Kalguksu (knife-cut noodles in a savory broth with veggies and chicken), and their pan-fried Mandoo (hand-made and filled with plenty of meat and some veggies). The mandoo here is particularly a star, with its crispy edges on the skin and an ample amount of filling. The Kalguksu was solid with a flavorful broth and good texture on the noodles and a good amount of chicken. The tteokbokki sauce was very good, though I didn't personally like the rice cake as much as some that I've had before. I prefer a soft and chewy tteok and this one had an oddly smooth outside layer to it. Still, it was decent and the other ingredients in the dish were well done.

It is nice to see a family-owned Korean restaurant that delivers on its promise of quality authentic flavors in its food. Can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"Another yummy Korean restaurant in Chinatown! This establishment is also fairly new and just down the street from TangTangTang. Dined in once and ordered takeout over the past weekend and both experiences were good. Tried the pollack fish roe soup, seafood udon, and seafood tofu soup. While everything is V good, it's not mind-blowingly good (not that most Korean food is...). The tofu soup is better over at Miga, but still tasty. 

They don't have a gajillion banchan's like some Korean restaurants, but their kimchee is DAMN good. Truly quality over quantity.

They're known for their handmade dumplings, but unfortunately, they all contain meat so I can't try :(

Our search continues for the best seafood tofu soup in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to have found a great Korean restaurant with very good soon dubu.  My husband had the cold noodles and he really enjoyed that dish also.  We look forward to trying more dishes in the future.  The restaurant is very clean and spacious.  From the outside, it looked like a very small space so we were surprised to see how large it was.  The ladies working there were all very nice and friendly.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Found a little mom and pop Korean restaurant in the China town area of Las Vegas. Best (real Korean) Korean homemade food I've ever had and that includes eating in San Francisco and Seattle. Great service as well! You won't be disappointed in anything except the pop Korean radio station that was playing. Lol...."}
{"text":"Come here if you want authentic, homemade Korean food.  The spicy soup dish we ordered was one of the best we ever had.  Their naengmyun is made from scratch, and it tastes amazing.  My boys ordered the kalgooksoo and cutlet, and both were inhaled the moment it hit our table."}
{"text":"Hello Auntie! Its like being invited by your cool Korean Aunts that prepared a delicious meal out of fresh ingredients. I first came across this family owned restaurant by chance with my sisters. We were formally greeted in Korean (-Hello)! Seated immediately with water and menus. One of the nice lady ask if it was our first time. She went over the Menu with us and explained about how they make everything out of scratch and recommended that we order their Mandu-Korean dumplings. Wow! The dumplings were simply delicious and consistent with flavors without being too soggy. They are available in 2 versions: Pan fried or Steamed. Both are delicious and great for sharing. Another item that stood out for us was the Kimchi Fried Rice, prepared just right without being overcook. The dish was seasoned and balanced with a good amount of heat. All meals are served with Banchan-side dishes. Each side dish was on point and lived up to being fresh and homemade. My sisters and I have been regulars here and never had any issues. Its been our to go place whenever we are craving for delicious Korean food.

Pro Tip:
-This establishment is NOT an AYCE Korean BBQ.
-Traditional Korean food in a casual family setting.

{"text":"I visited this resturaunt on a sunday evening around 7pm, and was suprised to see the whole place was empty. The food was average and somewhat authentic, but very overpriced. The serving portion here is probably the smallest I've seen in any korean restrauant. We were two adults and one child, average eaters, and needed 5 entrees. They offered just six side dishes. 

That said, our server/owner was extremely friendly. Moreover, I've not tried enough korean food in Vegas, so I won't do a comparison against local resturaunts. Will give 3 out of 5 stars based on US national standards."}
{"text":"Visited this place over the weekend looking for some good ole traditional Korean food. There's so many Kbbq places in town but not that many traditional places like this one...for when you just want some authentic Korean food that's not AYCE. 
I ordered the tofu soup with seafood. Now I didn't have too high of expectations for it since really tasty tofu soup is so hard to come by, but this one was delicious!! I didn't even realize I ate the entire bowl! Not the absolute best I've had but pretty good to satisfy an overdue craving. 
Hubby ordered the cold noodles. Although not his #1 in town, he still ranked it high up there behind the mul-naengmyun at Tangtangtang.
We also ordered the seafood pancake, which I thought was alright...It was good but just slightly soggy for my taste. 
I would definitely like to come back to try other dishes on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. A REAL traditional Korean restaurant that uses only the freshest ingredients made from scratch. If you see big brown pots on the side of the entrance, those are traditional Korean pots filled with homemade Go-Chu-Jang (spicy Korean chili paste) and Tang-Jang (Korean Miso), and Gang-Jang (soy sauce) fermenting and used in the various dishes on the menu. They're made from only the freshest ingredients, all natural, nothing processed. No MSG in this house. The quality of the food surpasses those fancier Korean \"fusion\" joints. Selection is simple but, everything we tasted was made with care and by the owner herself. Service was friendly, warm, and inviting. We loved everything we ordered down to the little side dishes (panchan). Their braised \"spicy\" short ribs (Galbi-Chim) was out of this world tender. They use the homemade Korean chili paste and you can ask to make it less spicy or no spice. Kimchi pancake was perfect. Crispy on the outside but soft, moist and tender on the inside. We like ours without the seafood. Just the kimchi. You can ask for that. Bone broth was used for the rice cake soup with Nori and generous pieces of beef that were so tender with no gristle. The proprietor is Sung Hee Choi. Give this amazing place a try. You won't be disappointed. Read her story on Las Vegas Seven. They did a full tribute on the owner and her story of how this place came to be. Quite the amazing history. She definitely takes pride in her preparations for quality, down-home Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch just as they opened. The space is very clean and open. Tables are not too crowded. I ordered the Jam Bong - seafood noodle soup. Their side dishes all tasted very good, i especially enjoyed the cucumber. The soup was a smaller portion than what I'm used to, but the broth was very tasty. They use a combination of regular seafood (whole shrimp, mussel, clam) and seafood mix. Seafood mix is normally a big no-no for me, but theirs did not take away from the flavor. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"The flavors were so muted. I've definitely had better Korean food at other places. Also, this place is a little overpriced for what you get. The side dishes are limited and boring. There are better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"I read the mixed reviews but I wanted some traditional style dishes instead of korean BBQ. After reviewing the menu I decided I would check this place out and get a bibimbop with some dumplings. 
I arrived about 630pm. There was an older Korean couple eating which gave me some confidence in choosing this place. It was never packed but a steady stream of folks coming in while I ate.
They only have 4 bon chon dishes but they are fresh and tastey. Food was great and the service was great. Will definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is not easy to find but it's totally wonderful if you look for simple and honest Korean foods.  The restaurant doesn't have English sign out so you need to follow GPS and its address.  Dishes taste fresh, simple, and can make one truly appreciate what real food tastes should be.  Price level is more than reasonable and the host is very accommodating for any of your special requests.  My lunch was simple and delicious.  It was a great pleasure!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chop chae, hot stone bibim bap, and the steamed meat mandu.
It came with 4 side dishes.
All the dishes were freshly made and healthy tasting. The taste was delicious. 
Friendly service too. Definitely will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing mandu in the west coast. I live in CA and, trust me, there are so many Korean and Chinese restaurants that sell mandu. But all I got were pre-cooked frozen ones but this place ACTUALLY MAKE MANDU!! And all employees are absolutely, AMAZINGLY KIND. I will come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Is all I can say about the food here. We ordered the Kalbi (Galbi), chicken Bulgogi and the steamed meat dumpling. Everything had such great flavor. The steamed meat dumplings are made with lean pork so they are on the dryer side if you are used to having juicy fatty dumplings. 

The Chicken Bulgogi has by far the best Bulgogi sauce used ever. I usually like to eat beef Bulgogi but I think I will be eating this shizzz more often.

The Kalbi (Galbi) is thick and juicy. Most places skimp out on that and charge the same price as this place. This one has about the same flavor as most good Kalbi spots so you are still getting your money's worth. Not to mention when you get the 12 grain bomb ass purple rice and side dishes they let you get refills on the sides you like a lot; huge plus on that by them.

Lastly the inside was so clean and the owners we super nice and made sure we were content and checked if we needed more sides."}
{"text":"Driving down Spring Mountain at the start of the stop by and try this incredible little cutie restaurant. I was immediately seated with a very friendly welcome and it's nice clean interior very affable and quick-service I ordered the spicy seafood soup and it was beyond spicy and the super hot they gave me the traditional sizes are also very tasty. I'm about to order the dumplings as they look delicious very pleased with what I've had very fast very friendly very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and it was so good. All of the staff are super nice and welcoming. Me and my cousin got the kim chi fried rice and tofu soup (both with beef) and they are so very delicious. The kimchi fried rice was not too spicy but the kimchi taste stood out a lot. Not only did it had the basic beef, kimchi, and rice but they included seaweed other yummy add ons. Same thing with the tofu soup, probably one of the better spicy tofu soups I've had in Las Vegas. 

We also got the dumplings and they were super yummy as well. They have a normal pork dumplings as well as kimchi dumplings but you can get them half and half if you want, the sauce that came with the dumplings fit really well with the dish. Will definitely be coming back soon. The food and service was wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was good too.It was a taste that did not put msg in the clean interior.We were so excited about our Korean food during the trip. I was so glad to see that it was so delicious."}
{"text":"My go to korean place for everythinggggg. This place has a legit korean grandma cooking so you know the food is authentic and bomb! She'll be out in the dining room at one of the tables rolling up dimplings. I've tried their kalguksu, pan fried mandoo, bibimbap, nengmyeon, and kalbi. All the dishes tastes homemade and are delicious. Their bibimbap is made with healthy rice tho (black rice I believe is what it's called) so it has a slightly different taste if you're use to white rice. It doesn't get as crispy in my opinion, but it's still yummy regardless."}
{"text":"Kkulmat () means delicious in Korean! 

I had bibimbab; with legit herbs, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a big portion of bulgogi! Oh and with purple rice*_* (Instead of plain old lettuce, carrots, beansprouts, and ground beef.) She actually forgot to pack gochujang with my bibimbab to-go, but I had some at home, so it was okay lol
Maybe she'll get me some more banchan when I visit next time. ;)

    I love to support local businesses. I want to encourage ppl to try these small restaurants in the valley. There's something special about these small restaurants, for me the comfort and the cozy vibe. (Big corporate-owned restaurants are nicely organized and reliable when it comes down to quality due to their popularity, but I feel they lack personal connection and uniqueness.) With that said, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Modern and clean environment, great service, servers will help you to grill your meat to perfection. Meat is fresh and of good quality."}
{"text":"I was craving some Korean food and just rolled the dice and happened to see this place while driving.  Ordered the dolsot bibimbop and I asked the server if they had dengjiang soup.  Wasn't on the menu.  She said yes.  She also told me she made the bean paste herself and brought it over from Korea.  All organic.  Delicious.  I highly recommend this place!  Ban Chan was simple but delicious."}
{"text":"I've alerts check out new places near me, I found this place last week so me and my friends decided to try.  I got bibimbab and my friends got toppoki. The bibimbab seem to be like regular not fancy bibimbab but the sauce is very delicious, they use quality ingredients like brown rice . I took my leftovers home cuz I couldn't finish it and it still delicious (unlike other places ) the week later I stop by and order a steam dumplings for take out, yes it's the best!! However, the side dish only for dinning only. The food more like homemade, simple and delicious. I'll definitely come back for the delicious food and delicious side dish"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had their seafood and beef tofu soup. This definitely is a mom and pop no frills korean restaurant that serves korean comfort food. Menu items include soups, cold noodles, spicy rice cake, galbijim and stews. The meat dishes are a tad pricey but other stuff on the menu is decently priced. 

The tofu soup was enjoyable. The tofu is broken up and not in big chunks like other places. It also comes with an egg. The flavor was good and they do have good portion sizes. They can also adjust the spice level for you. They also serve the soup with purple rice which I really enjoy. 

Since this is a mom and pop shop, service is decent. The older lady who is the waitress is not too attentive but there's a call button on each table to notify her if you need something. I'm definitely gonna come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We were driving through Vegas after a week of camping/cabinning in Utah and was craving some good Korean food. I was thinking Kimchi Jjigae or Oxtail dumpling soup. Most of the other Korean restaurants on Yelp featured Korean BBQ, which was not what we wanted. We wanted mom's cooking. Kkulmat was exactly that - it offers simple but delicious traditional Korean home cooking. We ordered two bowls of Rice cake and dumpling in beef broth and a kimchi Jjigae. Both were excellent. Very tasty, almost just like mom's (can't say it is exactly like mom's because everyone's mom's is always the best). The banchan was good too. The kimchi was tasty (not sour). The potato salad was one of the best I have had. Kkulmat made the rest of the long drive home easy. We recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Great service & food! The staff is very personable & care about customer satisfaction. Definitively give it a try if you want some homemade Korean food."}
{"text":"Another great Korean addition to Las Vegas.  The Mondu Soup was excellent.  Home made mondu, soup was hearty with lots of beef and rice cake., egg.  Ponchon was excellent.  
Service is good and friendly.
Prices slightly below the average for Korean food."}
{"text":"A taste of a Korean mom's home cooking!!!!! Side dishes are so fresh and made from scratch. Family owned and humble. Come here if you're looking for food made with love and care."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner and their dinning room was empty so my party got to chose where to sit. Just looking around it seemed like a plain environment, nothing stood out to me and the place was quiet. I seen an employee prepping food at the table behind us and another employee who was next to her took our order within 5 to 10 minutes sitting down. We ordered the Bibimbab, Grilled Croacker, and Dumplings. With the Grilled Croacker it came with a pot of purple rice, which was different to me but it tasted the same as any other rice. They serve unlimited side dishes such as kimchee, cucumbers, and potato salad. 

It took about 10 minutes for our entire order to come out after ordering and our server was really kind and persistent with checking up on us. She always ensured that if we needed anything to just let her know. She always thanked us and brought us any type of sauce we asked for. She provided us with an individual pitcher of water so that we wouldn't be waiting on it. It was a great experience. The reason why I gave this place 3 stars because there wasn't any \"wow\" factors that made me want to recommend or crave to come back. There weren't as much food varieties available, most of the dishes were easy and simple dishes you could make at home."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious Kimchi. I only got Pork katsu this time. I really loved the homemade sauce. Cutlet was not greasy at all. I found out that this chef does not use MSG. I will definitely come back to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a sudden craving for kalguksu one night, which lead my boyfriend to do a search on yelp for them. We knew that a lot of Korean restaurants in Las Vegas don't serve this particular dish -- why? We don't know. Not popular enough perhaps? However! Kkulmat showed up and their menu said they had a chicken kalguksu! Score! I've been meaning to try this place and now was the time! 

It's located where the old So Good Cafe was and you can't miss it because they didn't do anything to change the interior. So you'll probably see a lot of the old decorations from the old cafe -- macaroons on the wall and a coffee cup decoration on another wall. The tables and chairs all seem the same as well ...  But you don't need to be afraid because this five star review isn't dedicated towards their decorations. 

We came in for their food, hoping to find something warm and comforting. We were also hoping to find something other than the usual popular Korean flavors aka KBBQ. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share three dishes: chicken kalguksu (chicken noodle soup), pan fried mandu (dumplings), and tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) with cheese. From some of the reviews and tips on this establishment, the dumplings are made in house here and by hand. And you know what? That definitely shows. The dumplings were amazingly delicious. I wouldn't mind just getting an order to go for lunch during work days. They don't skimp on the meat and it is packed with flavor. The skin of the dumpling is pan fried perfectly for that crispness. 

The tteokbokki had really good flavor and they definitely give you a good portion! The rice cakes were really soft but they weren't that chewy. It was delicious. Though next time, I would've probably preferred it to be spicier. 

The chicken kalguksu is most definitely home made. The broth is very light in flavor and there is plenty of chicken in there! It also has zucchini and a few mushrooms -- they sprinkle nori on top and that gives it a lovely aroma. Definitely satisfied my craving! The only problem that I'll see is that the flavor of this dish may get muted if you eat it after the tteokbokki. So, if you order this dish, be sure to eat it before anything spicy or heavy in flavor. 

I would definitely come back to Kkulmat. I also hope that their business runs well because it's really hard to find Korean restaurants that home make their own stuff. Plus.. I'm in love with their dumplings! I need to come back to eat more!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute small restaurant with fantastic food and catchy Korean music! The owners are actually Korean and they seemed like a family owned business, which you don't see very often. They make every item on their menu from scratch and it comes in large portions. 
Service was great, he answered all the questions we asked and even recommended some items. 

Our orders come with the usual side dishes that you get when you go to a Korean spot, and the food came out in a reasonable time. 
Their homemade dumplings came out first, so delicious especially with the dipping sauce! The tofu soup w/beef was just as good, just the right amount of spice to it and even came with their style of brown rice ( purple rice). Kimchee fried rice was delicious and could feed two people,lastly the seafood onion pancake was perfectly cooked. Crispy in the outside but warm and soft on the inside. 

Will come back! Gonna try their fried chicken next time!"}
{"text":"This is worth freaken korean food i ever had in my life. The food was old and spoiled with out any taste of flavors. I feel shame that people like the owner of the restaurant open the place like to invite people to eat. I recommend any person not to go eat at this shatty restaurant. I am warning all of you not to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Yummy. Just yummy. Price isn't all low, but quality makes up for it.  The hand made dumpling was especially super yummy :)"}
{"text":"I think this is far the best korean food restauruant in Las Vegas. This is the closest to my mother's home made korean food. Makes me relaxed being away from home. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend and ended up really craving Korean soup on a Sunday afternoon. Sadly, when I started to yelp places, a lot of them were closed already. I then came across Kkulmat and decided to give this place a try.

This is a family owned restaurant and they actually treat their customers like family as well. Right when we walked in, we were greeted warmly and allowed to sit anywhere in the restaurant. The servers were all super friendly and smiled sincerely every time they came to serve us. We decided on the chicken kalguksu, kimchi pancake, and seafood udon. Right after our order, they brought out the sides, which were amazing! And unlike many other Korean places, they kept asking us if we would like more sides whenever one was about to run out. I was so focused on how great the sides tasted, I almost forget we ordered actual entrees. All of our order came out at the same time, and the granny of the shop was the sweetest of them all! She made sure we liked the kimchi pancake and would always check to see if we needed anything. 

In addition to amazing service, all three orders tasted amazing! The chicken kalguksu was very tasteful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. I also liked the huge amount of seaweed that they added on top of the soup. Many places will just sprinkle a little, but I liked that I tasted the seaweed in every bite. The seafood udon was also very delicious, however, i will say that it was a little spicy for me, since I can only handle mild. But if you can handle medium spicy, then I would definitely recommend it! Last, but not least, the kimchi pancake was amazing! The granny did an amazing job making that pancake and I wish I was able to tell her in Korean how great it tasted! I will definitely be back to try the homemade dumplings next time!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this place. I am absolutely obsessed with their mul naengmyun. Everything about the noodles and the broth is so refreshing. I have become a regular at this place. We come here every single night and tried most of their dishes. Everything we tried has never failed to disappoint us. They make their duk man du fresh so you must try it. Kkulmat is definitely a place everyone should try. The service is always amazing and they always make you feel at home. I'm glad I found this place."}
{"text":"This was very basic Korean food. The seafood tofu was ok. I've had better and I've had worse. Sides were basic which is really what I want and expect when I go out for Korean. The great news is that dinner for my husband and I came out to 25.00 after tip. I would not come back here again but it was good food."}
