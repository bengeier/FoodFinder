{"text":"With Great space and plenty of room to relax , chat, read or play around with your phone. The Cappuccino is alright , quite pricy for its size , this includes the health cookie as well . The healthy veggie cookie lacked some bite to it such as a kick of ginger or cinnamon , or maybe a bit of zest such as cranberries . Overall , another decent boutique cafe with a great location and inside space but on the higher end of the price scale . Welcome to the neighborhood :-)"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is just down the road from my condo so I thought I would give it a try. The shop itself carries a small selection of grab and go food and pastries.  My experience was an undercooked croissant and a less than impressive, poorly made, watery Americano. I prefer to support independent cafes but from previous reviews it seems as though my experience wasn't an isolate one so I will not be returning to 5 Elements."}
{"text":"I love the coffee and the service is always great! The patio is also a nice place to relax on a nice day."}
{"text":"Same as many other reviewers I was at first hesitant to go to this place after they had forced 7 Grams out of business. Finally today I stopped by and I have to say others are right. The display is full of unreadable signs as if you're in a touristy place and they are pushing things out to you. But that aside they just screwed up my order. I asked for a low fat no foam latte in a mug and I got a regular milk latte with foam in a to go cup that I wanted to avoid. The lady offered to pure my coffee in a mug but my issue was trying to avoid creating extra waste. The barista also wastes a lot of milk."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the old cafe that occupied the same spot and looked forward to the visits there.  This place while not as good as the old spot still gets the job done. Teas are by Sloane (pricey but decent for non blended versions). As for the my poison of choice the cappuccino here goes Latte art: Average Crema' OK Coffee bean reminds me of the old version which is fine.  The setup is virtually the same so can't complain there.  Overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is bright, beautiful, and friendly. We've looked all over for nice place to hang out and do some homework on our laptops. I think this is my favourite.  Nice food options and good coffee.  They have big work tables, power outlets and wifi. In the summer it's been nice to come here and enjoy the sunlight, the fresh breeze blowing through the open windows, and the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"At first, I didn't want to come here, after they forced out the previous business, 7 Grams Espresso bar.  7 Grams was a great spot, run by coffee-loving awesome people, and when I heard that they were being forced out so the owner could occupy and put in another coffee shop in it's place, that rubbed me the wrong way. Not cool to kill small local business like that.    After about a month, I went in on my way to work for coffee, thinking, meh, I'll give these guys a try. They jacked up the coffee prices (instead of 2.25 tax included, now you're looking at 2.40, plus tax for a medium coffee) and the coffee beans for filter aren't as good as before - Pilot coffee (what they have) is great, but the beans 7 Grams had before were faaaar superior.    The staff are a bit up-tight about pours - won't fill your cup to the top unless you ask.  I used to go to 7 grams with my to-go mug, pay for a medium, and they'd fill it up. These guys leave it 1/3 empty.  Weird, but whatever.     One day I noticed a vegan muffin on offer. Nice.  I asked the ingredients - was told, after the woman working the counter went and whispered with the owner about it for a little while, that while other things on offer are made in house, the vegan muffins are not made there and they didn't know the ingredients.  No offer to ask and let me know for next time, and they wouldn't tell me where they were made when I asked.  I found that very weird. The owner literally said 'there's peanut butter, banana, and oatmeal' (it was a peanut butter, banana, oatmeal muffin)  and then said \"I don't know what else is in it - muffin things\".  I was treated like some sort of spy for inquiring about something that doesn't seem like an outrageous question to ask a food service provider.   As it stands, this place doesn't hold a candle to what 7 Grams used to be like....which is too bad. 7 Grams was a great coffee spot, great for meetings, studying, reading, chilling with a great cup of coffee. Unfortunately, this place is taking itself a bit too seriously, and isn't really any of those things."}
{"text":"Regardless of some of the reviews, I liked the place. Friendly staff, multi layer coffee shop. Flat white was good, muffin was not fully baked (not good)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Flat white was good. Not sure what milk they used maybe skim from the last order since the latte art faded pretty quickly. Air conditioning that was a bit too cold for me on this warm spring day."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here because I used to come to 7 grams a bit. 7 grams was the cafe that was previously here (same location). From what I can tell, very little inside actually changed except maybe the ownership and staff. Anyway, I was hoping that this could be the cafe in this neighborhood that I could frequent more in the future instead of having to venture elswhere.  We got a cortado and a latte, both with soy milk. Despite it being fairly early in the day they were out of soy milk, so I asked that they swap it for almond milk instead. I got a stuffed brioche as well.  Interestingly the stuff brioche just had a little bit of topping at the top of it...there was very little topping and no stuffing for sure. When our beverages arrived, it seemed different. I initially thought that maybe the almond milk caused the drinks to taste different. After sipping my latte a little more, I could taste the almond milk in the latte, but the espresso was tasted sour. The flavours were two distinct ones and ended up being weird drinks.  I'm thinking maybe we just didnt' appreciate the beans that they were using there (?) or maybe it was an off day? So maybe I'll go back to try again another time."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff on Saturday afternoons, brought my friend here because I usually really like it here but the girl at the counter today was awful, I was embarrassed to have dragged my friend all the way up here :("}
{"text":"Nice quaint spot to set up your laptop and enjoy a coffee or expresso.  Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Incredibly expensive place. I ordered a muffin and a black coffee which came up to $7. The only perk of this place is that the downstairs has a nice atmosphere - it's relatively quiet and is a nice place to bring your laptop if you have work to do."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their Americano and the green tea latte is great to compliment your catching up with friends or studying for the next project/exam!  They also have sandwiches and pastries that you can try here. It's a coffee shop behind yorkville, not that busy and you can easily get work done here. Plenty of electricity outlets for all your electronic needs and they have complimentary wifi.  What stands out the most for me about this cafe is that there are plenty of space to sit, either lounge around by the fireplace or long communal tables to share with your group or private 1:1 tables along the other side of the wall.   There's two levels of the coffee shop so if you want a quieter and cozier place to study, you can opt to sit at the lower level of the coffee shop. You don't feel pressured to leave the coffee shop when you finish your drink and you can get a lot of work done!  LAST TIP??  Consider this as a meeting place with friends on research projects, discussing business plans, getting studying done or catching up with friends. The coffees/drinks aren't cheap though in comparison to Tim Hortons but it's better than sitting at Starbucks!"}
