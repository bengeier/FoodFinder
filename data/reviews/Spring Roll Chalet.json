{"text":"Spring Roll Chalet is a dependable Vietnamese restaurant, serving Pho, vermicelli noodle bowls etc. You line up to place your order then sit and wait for the owner to call your number when your food is ready.  Food is ALWAYS served quickly!!!  Food is also very tasty (the spring rolls are amazing!) and is reasonably priced for downtown Calgary.  Downside is it's great popularity for lunch - the line up can extend out the front door - and almost always has crowded seating.  Go early if you want to grab a seat...or for your own sanity, take it To Go!"}
{"text":"I come here to pick up lunch very often! #5 spicy sate beef noodle is what I get every time. Coming from Toronto I find it on the more expensive side ($10 for the pho) but it is really great. Line gets really long by 11:30-12 and I believe the place closes by 2pm."}
{"text":"Great little mom & pop style place with fantastic food. It is low key and informal but always packed over the lunch hour. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 2/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Came here a while back (sometime in November 2010) and decided to write a short review.  The look of the restaurant was dingy and instead of waiters you go up to a counter, place your order and seat yourself wherever you want until your order is ready. Only good thing about this place was that the food came out fast. The prices for noodle soups were reasonable at about $8-$10. My bf ordered their beef noodle soup while I ordered their spicy lemon chicken noodle soup.   My bf and I expected his beef noodle soup to be pretty decent pho seeing as how it was a Vietnamese restaurant but it was in no way authentic or plain good even as a noodle soup. The broth was bland and both of our dishes came out luke-warm (ick). The noodles were vermicelli instead of the typical wide rice noodles in pho and there wasn't even a lot in it. Definitely did not go well with the soup. My spicy lemon chicken broth was so bland and watery. It was like mixing together water + few drops of chili oil + MSG + grease. There wasn't a hint of lemon flavour and the chili oil did nothing to add to the soup. Such a disappointment! My only favourite part was eating the chicken which was considerable moist (probably from soaking up all that watery goodness *yum =P *) and fairly thick.   Overall, I did not enjoy this place very much and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've tried 6 or 7 other places in town and further out in Calgary, and this is hands down the best or at most, the 2nd best (which I'll write a review about later). The #5 with veggie spring rolls is ace. to be honest, the pork spring rolls are pretty stock, but the veggie ones are always crunchy and fresh and i love that sauce they give with it. I've tried other broths but i almost strictly stick to the #5, and I also love that it's extremely quick, but if you look in the back you can see everything is hot and steaming and they're doing it all on the fly, so you know it'll be freaking wonderful.   The reason it gets a 5 for such an unassuming place, however, is their service. They don't waste time with pleasantries and yet are not rude, and a few weeks ago i got takeout (which takes about 30 seconds if you slide in around 11/11:30), and the bag was poorly tied, and the whole broth bowl ended up landing on my foot a few feet from the door. I didn't analyze the bag, but I'm also pretty clumsy, so I can't tell if I was at fault or the tie. Either way, I just went in and asked for another broth and I was happy to pay for it as I was the one who dropped it. Not only did they apologize profusely, they redid my entire $15 order for i think $4 dollars. Even though the rolls, noodles and drink from my first order was totally fine, I just needed a new broth with the beef and sprouts.   Now I know for people who eat at corporate places, being charged at all seems outrageous because of how much chains pander to their customers, even when the customer is flatout wrong. The reason I love this place is they don't waste their time being insincere or anything, yet they never rush you out if youre slowly finishing yur food, and when they need to demonstrate some service like in my case, they do. Typically lower-end places especially if they have a good business flow, don't give a crap about things like this, so I found their service to be a sound balance between corporate ass-kissing and \"eff off, we don't need you\" mentality of smaller restaurant owners."}
{"text":"Fresh fast hot and delicious. Yes it's chaotic during the rush but this place is about the food, if I wanted ambiance I'd head elsewhere.   Try the Vietnamese stew soup - you can choose rice, rice or egg noodles. It's a rich, slightly thicker broth than sate. I've bee searching for that richness in a soup here in Calgary.... I finally found it.   Still looking for authentic spring rolls wrapped in rice paper vs egg roll wrappers served with crispy lettuce. Rolls here had substance and were tasty enough and definitely contained meat. Some places you wonder."}
{"text":"This place is popular for weekday lunch and I can see why. Get here before 11:40 if you can. It gets pretty busy and the orders get called out by the staff. Pay attention! Our orders (30-lemongrass chicken & 34-beef w/broccoli) were prepared quickly and tasted great."}
{"text":"Wow, best soup in the beltline/core. The broth is so full of flavor. The staff are so nice. The lunch line up is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Try the traditional beef satay soup. This place gets really busy so if you want to guarantee a seat, I usually get here by 11:30 at the latest.  The wonton soup and vermicelli bowls are also good."}
{"text":"Going to the Spring Roll Chalet when its busy is something of an experience.    Its definitely a mom & pop operation with mom usually taking orders and running the till and dad shuttling orders from the kitchen to the service area.  It all seems very hectic but what got to me was the amount of yelling.  When you get to the till you're yelled at \"are you ready to order\".  When your food is ready mom will yell (and quite loudly), \"number xx....READY\".  Entertaining for a moment and then quickly gets annoying.  The food is decent.  Very fresh but a little bland.  They're convenient, prices on the high side of average."}
