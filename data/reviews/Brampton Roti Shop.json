{"text":"Really Good Roti!

So it is quite hard to find an authentic roti shop, and this place is pretty much on the mark. It is in a pretty dive area, but most places like this usually are.

The chicken roti is really good, sometimes a bit watery but still very yummy! The doubles are really yummy and greasy! I have yet to try anything else there, but the stuff I have tried is really good! I cannot finish one roti on my own, the dhal puri is yummy even to eat on its own or dip it in curry!

I always call ahead and give it at least a half hour because they are always busy."}
{"text":"Best Roti I've had. The owner is very friendly. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5 years and they've always had great quality.  i wish it was a hair cheaper but no prob.  Perhaps I'm too white but medium heat on my roti was fire! But it was still awesome."}
{"text":"My new favourite roti shop. Great chicken roti. Great doubles."}
{"text":"In my quest for Roti around the world, this is the best Roti I've had since I left Trinidad in 1997! Buss up Shot roti bread is outstanding! Wish they had mango chutney and the curry potatoes were more chunky and had 'channa' - that would've given them an extra star or more. 
Owners-cooks are very friendly and the place is clean and nice - for a Roti shop. Would go back if around the area."}
{"text":"This place use to be the go to spot. unfortunately they keep shrinking my roti. I use to barley be able to eat 1. now I kill one and need some more.

this place could be a gem if they kept their size big. I wish you could explain to owner this, but she seems to be very narrow minded which is also not good for business."}
{"text":"Didn't have as good of an experience as these other two people but it's still tasty.  Ordered 2 doubles and a chicken roti and a banana drink to go.  Doubles weren't bad, a little soggy for my liking, but I'd get the doubles again.  The chicken roti on the other hand wasn't my favorite in the area.  Maybe I just got unlucky but I had alot of pink and gristly bits of chicken in the roti, I generally like to see at least some white meat but most of the pieces I got inside were a little gristly etc. for my tastes.  I much prefer the chicken roti at Vishnu's on Kennedy.  This one at Brampton Roti Shop is alot \"wetter\", more gravy I suppose where the one at Vishnu's is drier, but it's all about your own opinion..  Next time I go I'm considering trying the shrimp, but I often wonder if places like this have them de-veined or not."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Very convenient location. My favourite curry chicken. Doubles are nice too. The employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Had to update my review based on the past three times I've visited. This restaurant is making a classic mistake that most restaurants end up making after they've built up their clientele.

I use to love this place because their roti were so fresh and packed with chicken and potato. Now it's very slender, mostly sauce and has a day old taste about it. 

I will not be coming here anymore and am now on the hunt for a new place... Too bad.."}
{"text":"In terms of Doubles and Aloo Pie this was my go to place when I use to reside in Brampton! If I am ever in the area I do try to make my way out to the shop, but that doesn't always happen unfortunately. :( 

I see that a lot of the reviews are talking about the roti, but I can't comment on this as I have always grabbed doubles and aloo pie to go. I can say that the family does wear their heart on their sleeves and have always worked hard to prepare everything fresh, their a true Trini family to the bone!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Ontario for business, I always make time to drive out to Brampton just for a chicken roti from the Roti Shop. I was introduced to this place several years ago by a friend in Canada and have been going back faithfully year after year. The service is great and everyone there treats you like family. A \"must try\" in Brampton!!!"}
