{"text":"Cafe Social is a clean, comfortable and warm place. Great coffee, and the best apple turkey sandwich I ever had."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here at least three times per week and I absolutely love it!  They have an extensive selection of drinks that are always exquisitely prepared. The matcha is excellent, and I highly recommend the Resees mocha if you're feeling indulgent. The empanadas are some of my favorite around, with a crisp, flaky, slightly buttery crust that is to die for. The pastry selection is small but delicious, especially the giant cinnamon rolls. Best of all, the staff is delightful; they are very helpful and genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"I have found myself coming in everyday since the first Chai that I tried here! The service is always really great and the prices are super reasonable. They also have empanadas, pastries, and pizza from local restaurants.  It is also a good environment to study or get work done. I would highly recommend stopping by and checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Cafe Social is comfortable, clean, and a welcome addition to the Bassett Neighborhood. It is located in the Uncommon Building. From the outside I thought I might be looking at a beautiful lobby for the apartments, but as I got closer it was obvious that it was (also?) the entrance to Cafe Social.  I had a Guiso empanada and a pork tamale. The barista gave me the reduced price for ordering one of each. Score! They were served with red salsa and salsa verde. I preferred the green, a little spicier.   The real star of my visit was a drink from their holiday menu, the green tea chai latte. Smooth. Spicy. Delicious. I'm sad that this drink will only be seasonal.   Overall, a nice cafe to grab a snack and do some work."}
{"text":"I normally am slightly wary of cafes in apartment buildings, hotels, etc. but this one is so tasty! Their breakfast sandwich is inexpensive and so delicious. I will definitely be back. Also, their chai latte is so good. If you're looking for something very tasty for a very good price, check it out"}
{"text":"Great aesthetic! Lots of natural light. Great iced chai. The guy who works there is super chill. 5/5 would recommend"}
{"text":"This is a solid cafe. I've been a few times and it's always a pleasant experience! The coffee is great and they have decent variety of food considering the small space they have behind the register. Their coffee is fair trade and sourced from Colombia by the same family who runs the cafe... so cool! The empanadas are good; I recommend the beef one... I wish they had more stuffed inside, but they're still delicious for a filling snack. The choco chip cookie is average. The stand out food option was definitely the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The eggs were scrambled and fluffy (instead of plasticky, which so many breakfast sandwich eggs tend to be) the bacon was crunchy, the english muffin was dense and tasty, and the cheese was actually good quality! So many breakfast sandwiches are disgraced with American cheese. I'm not sure what type this was, but it was melty and delicious! Stop by here for great fair trade coffee and easy snacks. Oh, and it's a good study spot! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"You have to try their Mango Smoothie, Dirty Ice Chai. Matcha Latte with espresso!! Their specialty drinks are bomb!"}
{"text":"Order: 12oz dark roast   Probably one of the more bitter/acidic cups I've had in a long time, price point was not cheap either at 2.30.  Atmosphere was nice, barista friendly, but coffee was just burnt and not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Was sad to come here looking for a local roaster and find Pickwick had closed, but I still needed my coffee. I got a small regular latte, which was quite good. They use Torani syrups and subpar coffee beans, so they lost a star, but the barista was very good at what she did, which I've had a hard time finding in Urbana/Champaign."}
{"text":"Great tasting  coffee from the owner's sister's farm in Columbia! The baristas are very amiable and make well constructed, satisfying drinks. There are a lot of unique, original drinks I gotta try, but I'd definitely recommend the Mayan Mocha (if you like spicy) or the Yuzu coconut smoothie. They also have Manolo's empanadas and other pastries if you're looking for a quick bite. Absolutely love the vibe and open space of this place. This is a new place on campus and it's definitely worth a try! It's already one of my favorite spots to come!"}
{"text":"Cheaper than star bucks but tastes the exact same! Maybe even better! The lounge area reminds me of \"Friends\" from the the tv show but overall a amazing place to stop in with friends!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick small snack. I go there for their empanadas - they get them from manolo's and are extremely tasty. I've also heard that if you live in HERE Champaign, they also do free delivery if you call them. Definitely a place to try out!"}
{"text":"For the space it has available, cafe social does a great job. It feels a bit odd as it is in an apartment building lobby but make no mistake, you can get good coffee here. I've been here about 10 times now and every single barista is incredibly kind and informative. Two thumbs up. Downside is there's not great parking is you are driving to this location"}
{"text":"The seating is a bit odd, but that is the only slightly negative comment I have about this place. There are occasionally some people working on their laptops here, but the bar seating against the window feels low and somewhat cramped. It's a super convenient location for me, but I could see how parking would be difficult. I think it has a bigger goal of attracting foot traffic anyhow based on its location.  The baristas are really friendly, and the dirty chai with soy milk is da bomb. Their empanadas are pretty tasty too, and it's one of the closest tastes I can get to breakfast tacos in Madison if I don't make them myself (can I get an amen to breakfast tacos anyone?). They have a punch card too for drinks. This is, overall, a really nice spot for a quick breakfast, lunch, or caffeinated beverage, especially if the Uncommon (apartment complex where this is located) is one of your neighbors."}
{"text":"Great little place for coffee and a nice selection of breakfast and lunch items. Even has a few gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Cafe Social is pretty cool! It's a new coffee shop in the Bassett neighborhood which has been desperately needed ever since Electric Earth Cafe closed. It's in the Uncommon Building if you don't spot it right away.  I stopped in for breakfast on my way to work and was greeted by the owner (I think). Cafe Social advertises their use of Colombian Coffee beans and my iced coffee didn't disappointment. The barista gladly filled it in my reusable cup and I was on my way. Their iced coffee was considerably less bitter than other places.  I also got two empanadas: one egg one and one caramelized onion with feta. Now these were some TASTY empanadas, served with a side of salsa verde. They were from a local bakery called Violet Rose (which I had never heard of). They also have tamales from El Sabor de Puebla and I absolutely love their food. Since I got two empanadas, the barista mentioned the second one was a bit cheaper, but I didn't see that listed on the menu.  Overall, it was a great visit and I can't wait to come back to try more food. Two quick suggestion: figure out a way to make parking easier. There's no dedicated spots! Even 1 or 2 spots would go a long way. Second: work a bit on the website and add a mobile version. The Yelp page was really informational with menus, hours, and photos, but the website wasn't very user-friendly. I was looking for quick links like \"Menu,\" \"Hours,\" or \"Location,\" but had to dig through several pages to find that. I don't think their food menu is actually on the site."}
