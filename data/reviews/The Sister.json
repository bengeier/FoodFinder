{"text":"For my money, Mitzi's Sister is my West End go-to if I'm on Queen West or around Parkdale. I was just reminded of this the other night.  The other night a few friends of mine whom I eat nachos with wanted to meet up (seriously -- this is one of the things we do together). They are new-ish Torontonians and our thing is we try a new place every subsequent time we meet up (previous stops have included Bryden's, the Mugshot, Nirvana and Sneaky Dee's). I was near Queen/Ossington so I suggested the Cadillac, which became our plan. Upon walking by, I realized the bar was too full so I suggested we reroute to the Sister.  My friends loved it for its affordable prices and its outstanding (and reasonably priced) food, which puts most pub grub in the city to incredible shame. The nachos were excellent and unique; the haddock taco, which I have been known to venture far, far away from home for, was perfect as usual; and the poutine was, well, you get the idea.   Sure, it's easy to enjoy yourself at a place on a slow, drizzly Sunday with warm friends and cold beers, but it's the Sister's impeccable selection(s) and lovely service that will keep me coming back -- and which has. For years.   Long live the Sister."}
{"text":"These guys have lost their minds.  They hiked the price of their ho hum hamburger to $18.  In the heart of Parkdale?  This isn't the Park Hyatt guys and there are lots of places your equal within a 4 block radius who sell the same thing for half the price.  They won't be getting any more of my business."}
{"text":"Good prices, good service, fresh food.  The food options for vegetarians are excellent.   It's a great place for brunch or a hot meal and a relaxing atmosphere.  the weeknight deals are well worth it- check them out ahead of time. (particularly the tuesday nachos!) I have never even seen Nachos that compare to the Sister's. The homemade salsa, guacamole, and bean dips are outstanding quality and extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Not my favourite breakfast place (go to Mitzis down the street if there's room) this is a great evening place: friendly, bustling, good food, probably some charming musical acts later in the evening, and a decent patio in the summer. Chicken fingers are particularly excellent."}
{"text":"Great Pub, warm atmosphere, live music well presented and a real piano on stage!"}
{"text":"Apparently there's musical performances some times which are good?  Really, I'm just writing this review because one time I went I had the butternut squash soup with toasted pecans, and something else yummy in it, and while it was totally way too expensive, it was aMAZing.   And the back patio is cute and intimate, and the brunch is delicious.   Oh, and I enjoy the crowd that haunts it."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, food was good.  I've been to Mitzi's Sister a few times for brunch and had a pleasant experience....this however, has left a very bad taste in my mouth.  A girlfriend and I headed here one evening on hopes to eat and enjoy a drink or two. Walking in felt nice.....the atmosphere was relaxed and I recall the music being okay.  After sitting in the restaurant (which was only 1/4 full) for almost 10 minutes, I started to wonder if we were noticed by our server (name started with a T, ended in a Y), although she had walked by us a few times. Eventually, she came over and took our drink order. Asking what kind of beer was offered was a mission she did NOT want to tackle and she made that very clear.  After ordering and eating, all we wanted to do was get our bill and get the f%@! out of there. The food was okay....didn't blow my mind or anything but we both left with full tummies.  When our server realized she had made a mistake on our bills, she snatched them both out of our hands, turned around in a huff and fixed her mistake. We were in no way unpleasant to deal with and it was obvious the tables near us were afraid to ask her for anything.  I have worked in the customer service industry for years and have learned a lot. Even on my worst days, I would never be rude to a paying customer or make them feel like they were an inconvenience in any way.  I hope that this was just an unfortunate day for her.....maybe she just put her dog down or she received some terrible news that day. Regardless, if she continues to treat people the way she did when we were there, I would be shocked to walk by and see more than one table during her shift."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot for food and drinks!  It is a restaurant/bar and although the menu reflects that with the nachos, poutine, and wings, there are other delicious items from which to choose.  The braised lamb and sweet potato roti is unexpectedly good and the black bean burrito and blackened haddock tacos are far better than your average bar food. If you are in the mood for typical pub fare then try the Tamarind and Lime chicken wings or the Even More Twisted fries.   Also, on Wednesdays (I think) it's Kid's Day so if you're looking for a kid-friendly place to meet other parents for lunch/dinner, this is the day to come :)  Bands throughout much or most of the week."}
{"text":"on Wednesday, Jan 29th 8pm, ate burger with my kids.  should be a sign not to eat there when they said there are only 4 dishes to choose from: burger, fish/chips, nachos and grilled cheese. i'm a nurse and been off for 2 days now because of severe diarrhea and vomiting.  soo angry but relieved that it was not my kids or an immunocompromized person.  customers beware!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the fact that this bar is a block from my apartment and I am lazy  is making me up my rating here, but I am quite fond of the Sister. Good quality but standard variety of pub food - highlights include the fish tacos and the pulled pork grilled cheese. Great beer selection and average or slightly higher than average beer prices. Delicious comfort food specials (Sunday roast beef dinner!). Efficient but not overly friendly service. Awesome patio and great brunch menu. The decor is not great since their renovation and the ambience has deteriorated somewhat, but overall this is a good little neighbourhood pub and probably my most frequented bar in the city."}
{"text":"Try the lamb burger & sweet potato fries.... so good! I also like deal nights (one time I'm pretty sure I had 1/2 price nachos) and when they have concerts. Service is kind of surly, maybe that's just me... Decor is eclectic, interesting."}
{"text":"I had a burger here and it was good, but it was pretty far out of the way. The place is a cross between a bar, a pub and a restaurant which is really nice. I think it's about the same size as the Free Times Cafe.  The food was good, they had a weird beer that I tried: Apricot Wheat.  It's mostly the fact that this location doesn't have too much to do that I've given it 3/5 stars, otherwise it's a solid place. It feels like a College St. bar/pub after all."}
{"text":"We have favoured Mitzi's Sister as our go-to brunch place for about 5 years now, and it has been consistent over time.   I almost always get the French Toast - in fact, I can't remember a time that I didn't, but I'm pretty sure I've tried some of the other options like Huevos Ranchero and a sandwich of some sort. But I always love going and hearing what the French Toast flavour of the week is - it's different every time! Some of my favourites have been toasted coconut with key lime, and pomegranate with custard. Lesser favourites are any that are covered in chocolate - too sweet in my opinion. But no matter what, it is always satisfying.   My husband gets the Eggs Benny every time without fail too. It's funny - we don't get this stuck in a rut at other restaurants.... but here, we know what we love, and we stick with it.   Both come with their homefries, of which the recipe remains a secret.  Those alone are enough to keep us coming back week time after time.  The servings sizes are filling and generous, and proportionate to the slightly higher prices (but totally within reason).  We've been tempted to try their dinners, and have heard good reviews. But we seem to only find ourselves there for weekend brunches.   The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but they do brunch, and they do it well. Long live Mitzi's Sister!"}
{"text":"Just went here for a drink on a Wednesday night, so I can't comment on the food, but service was friendly and attentive.  It was a chill place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"The Sister, the new name for the former Tennessee Tavern, and most recently, Mitzi's Sister, is a fine improvement over the previous incarnations. The interior has been redesigned, but the kitchen is still quality controlled by \"Mitizi\".   The specials are not what they used to be, but I still find their food to be very good. In particular, I really like their Crispy Tofu which is only $7. This marinated, breaded, deep fried tofu comes with  your choice of two sauces, and usually pick their \"tangy suicide\" and \"spicy barbecue\". They are delicious, and the suicide sauce has just enough zing and hotness to really give the tofu flavour without burning out your taste buds.  I come here on a weekly basis, and it is my main bar in Parkdale. I come here mainly for the beer. They have a great selection of micro brewed beers on tap. I find I usually go for the Durham Hop Addict IPA or Neustadt Springs 10W30 Ale. I love hoppy ales, and I like dark ales, so these two beers fit that nicely.  If you are looking for a lighter lager, they of course carry Steamwhistle.  Not sure why all the negativity here in the reviews, but I really like this place, and it still has much of the old character of Mitizi's.  Now that the warm weather is here, it  also has a great backyard patio. I highly recommend this place if you find yourself in South Parkdale."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service of any bar I've been to, and I have been here nearly a dozen times.  Beer specials are good, food is average.  Nice place to have a few chill beers with friends, especially during the week."}
{"text":"Three stars or four, I can't decide...  Mitzi's is an institution that has been around for a century in various avatars. It is a must-visit place if you want to garner any respect in the community especially the hipster/west-end culture which I associate myself with. It is fashionable to talk about both Mitzi's and its sister cafe, and rave about this wonderful cafe in the heart of Parkdale. The SISTER cafe is located right on Queen Street west, between Lansdowne and Roncesvalles, and there are sufficient reasons to make a trip here and be more socially acceptable.  Besides earning social credit, I would also go to this location for their regular music nights. There is a small cover (I guess if you enter after a certain time) and bar food that goes great with some rock.  I wouldn't go for their pricey brunch..."}
{"text":"***3.5***  I just came back from yet another brunch at Mitzi's. This place is literally a 5 second walk from my boyfriend's house, so we have been here on a few occasions, mostly when we are too lazy to venture much further for brunch.   Some of the brunch items are truly delicious but some are lacklustre, and though the portions are HUGE, I find that some of the plates come piled with too many carbs. Sometimes I want a side of salad with my eggs and potatoes.   Today I had the fish cakes (made with cod) with poached eggs. It came with a mountain of home fries, and 2 HUGE and THICK slices of buttered sourdough bread. It also had some fruit on the side. The fish cakes were yummy and not too greasy. My poached eggs were perfect, and the home fries had good flavour. My problem with my plate was that I could only eat half a slice of my toast and about half my home fries. By the time the waitress took my plate away, I felt embarrassed to be wasting so much food. But seriously, who can have this many carbs in one seating?   My boyfriend had the ultimate hangover sandwich, which consisted of eggs,kimchi,garlic mayo and bacon on thick cut sourdough bread. His plate also came with home fries. I had a couple of bites of his sandwich and it was delicious!!! The mixture of the kimchi and the egg and the bacon - WOW!    When I came here last week I had their french toast (made with challah bread) and the topping of that day (their toppings change all the time) was caramelized bananas, graham crackers and whipped cream. DELICIOUS! It was just so damn good! Definitely the thing to order when they have it. My only problem was that the french toast also came with home fries. I don't know about anyone else but I don't particularly want to eat fried potatoes with my french toast. It just doesn't go. I left the home fries untouched, and once again I felt awful about wasting food.   I will continue coming to Mitzi's because its really convenient when I am over at the boyfriend's house to just pop in here for some brunch. And the food is good, however it just isn't mind blowing amazing. They would definitely get another 1/2 star if they started adding some salad to their dishes. Sometimes, I need some veggies with my side of artery clogging bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable brunch with interesting options and old standbys. Helpful and friendly staff were quick to turn down the music when we asked and totally relaxed about us sitting around talking after we'd eaten."}
{"text":"Sister to the popular Mitzi's brunch spot in Parkdale, this West Queen West spot boasts a fine mix of beers on tap and an eclectic roster of live music acts almost every night of the week.  Be sure to check out the decor on the walls - one-of-a-kind, handmade instruments that look so incredible, one can only hope they're actually playable."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but the terrible service ruined it for us. Portions for my meal were very small for the price, but for the same price other meals were much better representative in terms of value.  I had bought m'lady a voucher for this venue as a Christmas present, since I knew that she loved this place. We went there a few days before the voucher expired (yesterday), and wow what terrible service.  We sat down and it took forever for the server to come to our table. When she finally came to our table, she asked if we were there for the nachos. It would appear as though nachos as well as Keiths were on special that day, however their sign that's usually propped up in front of their venue facing people walking up & down the side walk was lying against the wall and therefore illegible. She assumed we knew what was on sale. It took forever for us to get our meal, and then when we were done, we had to ask the bus boy to get pack up the rest of m'lady's meal, get her a water, and the bill. He asked the server for the bill and she yelled across the room \"Are you using a Groupon?\" After answering that we were, she eventually left the bill on our table. The bill was miscalculated in our favour, so I left more than enough to cover the rest after the group deal and left. She was just standing around the bar throughout the majority of our visit.  I got a mushroom ravioli which was very small for the $13 price, where-as m'lady got I believe a rota for the same price. My ravioli was tiny, yet very tasty, yet m'lady's roti filled her plate very nicely with a salad as well as the actual roti which was at least 3 times the size of my entire meal.  All-in-all, I'd very likely return for the food, however the service was absolutely terrible. I've been to this venue before and I don't believe I've ever had such a terrible experience with the service, so I'd return to see if perhaps the waitress was just upset because of all the group deals she was getting that evening."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning, extremely hungover. This wasn't my ideal brunch place to go to at that time, but it was just around the corner from my house so I decided to give it a try. It was about noon when I got there and the place was packed. We got seated fairly quickly but service was very slow. They seemed to only have one waitress on for the entire restaurant. We were seated directly in front of a large window and the sun was shining in so I started feeling a bit more positive about having come here, that maybe everything was going to be okay, the food would be wonderful and I'd go home satiated and happy.   It took a very long time for us to get our meals. I got the Spicy scrambled eggs and he got the fishcakes and eggs, on top of that we ordered a side of bangers. He liked his fishcakes and eggs, but thought it was a bit greasy. I couldn't finish my scrambled eggs. They were supposed to be mixed with feta but they felt so creamy and thick that I couldn't stomach it. Everything was greasy and unsettling.   I did have a ceasar and they put in lots of horseradish as I requested. This drink was excellent. Best thing I had there, hands down.  My advice? Go for the drinks or the music, but keep the food as a secondary item."}
{"text":"Root vegetable roti FTW. Service was fabulous."}
{"text":"Great Reuben, friendly service."}
{"text":"I was at High Park to check out the cherry blossoms over the weekend and had skipped breakfast and lunch so I was starving when I got to The Sister for a late brunch (around 2:30).  Never been here before and when I stepped in, it looked empty. The guy at the bar said to take any seat, so I walked in and saw a few diners at the booths, they also have a back patio and I'm guessing there were more people eating outside. The space does not have the look or feel of a restuarant that does service before 5pm, it really is a pub.   I got the eggs benny and it was really good, or I was just very hungry cuz I finished it in about 15 minutes. I did like the peameal bacon and homefries that came with it.  Would try them again if I'm ever in the area... Which is very rare. Quick service, they could smile a bit more, but I was just there to eat."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch with some friends. The service was really great. Ordered the pancakes, or should I say, pancake. The pancake was small but super tasty!!!!! I found it a bit pricey for one small pancake and a few potatoes on the side. My friends ordered the hangover meal and eggs benny. The plates were huge and apparently the food was good. I guess I chose the wrong meal. I would return."}
{"text":"Apparently they didn't season anything the day I went in. The salad I had was so bland. I couldn't even taste the bacon bits, and the dressing was watery for a blue cheese. The ingredients weren't the freshest, and the coffee was terrible.   Music and ambience is where the two stars come from. I kinda like the hipster vibe. It's dank... I dig on that. Go there for the drinks, but unless you're getting fries, skip it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat. I've tried a lot of dishes but I keep going back to their freshly made chicken fingers and twisted sister fries (sweet potato and regular) with a side of homemade blue cheese dressing. It's my favourite guilty pleasure!   I agree that sometimes their service isn't the best but you just need to choose the time you go a bit more wisely."}
{"text":"I like the location of The Sister, however, it did not meet my expectations in terms of being a fine brunching experience.  The menu is lackluster and predictable.  The service and coffee were decent.   I was not bananas about the art that they were displaying (very subjective statement I realize) and the music was forgettable.  I ordered the huevos rancheros.  It was tasty indeed.  However,  the tortilla was shaped into a cone on its side with the fixings spilling out of it.  I could not help thinking about those cones they put on dogs so that they did not lick their stitches.... I would not rush back."}
{"text":"Great for a hangover....  There is not much to say about this place. The service isn't great, the deals are not something i'd come back for.  When you walk in it looks like a run down pub trying acting with an upper case menu.   The food a bit pricey, is delivered with presentation, and quite good.  They played african music which gave a chill vibe.  All i can say is the Nachos are average... and that its   Great for a hangover"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for brunch. My friends love this place and I find myself there often on a weekend. They LOVE the food. I find the food just OK. It's not bad, but there is better brunch out there. There is never a line to get a table and its never super busy. Food is prompt and there is never an issue with service but the food is just average. Prices here are normal. But again the food is just ok. The Caesars however... worth going for. Hair of the dog.  Oh and please Mitzi's staff... no more Regina Spektor at brunch. I'm nursing a hang over and would like to not feel like I want to kill myself in the process."}
{"text":"A fun spot that does decent food at reasonable prices. I have been coming here since it was known as \"Mitzi's Sister\" and have never had a bad meal.  The patio is great on warm days, and there are often live music acts here in the evenings.   As brunch goes, this place does great corned beef hash, great eggs florentine, nice pancakes with weekly specials for fruit toppings and even offers cod cakes.  This is also one of the only places in which I will order chicken tenders. They never serve crummy frozen chicken fingers. These are actual, lightly breaded (not battered) real chicken tenders."}
{"text":"Meh is right....Never mind the renovations that make it look like an even dingier bar than before in my humble opinion..  I also think that the food has been steadily going downhill for the past 6 years or so.  Ordered burgers to go, with an extra aoli sauce.  Did not get the extra aoli i asked for. No cutlery was provided. They failed to mention that the fries were half sweet potato fries which I am not fond of. I KNOW i could have gotten regular fries but forgot. A reminder would have been nice.  Also, the staff always seems SO bored. Or that you are one lucky bastard to have gotten them as a server. No smiles or any attempt at friendliness.   Whatever, I'll most likely go back just due to location but whatever, I won't be excited."}
{"text":"Cool place, the service started off rocky because nobody came to help us out right away, but I think they might have been short staffed for the night. As said, with the service starting off rocky, the server wasn't too friendly to begin with. He later warmed up to us, so it wasn't all awkward. Menu was decent. We started with a few burgers and some drinks. Drinks came reasonably quick, but as for food, when it did come, we were missing one of the orders. The servers were super nice about comp-ing the meal since they had forgotten, and it did come out pretty quickly. Food was good; typical bar food but better than some I have tried. Servers opened up to our group and were really cool by the end of the night. They had an amateur comedy night in the other room, which we weren't into. Would have been nice to have some light music on our side. Other than that, a nice place for a quick late night bite and drinks with the girls!"}
{"text":"(Originally posted Feb 8/12 for Mitzi's Sister and was advised to move this to the new restaurant page by staff)  FYI, Mitzi's has rebranded, the sign above the door reads \"The Sister\" but keep in mind, different name, same terrible service.  I popped by last night to grab a pint with friends and maybe buy some fries, but I genuinely wished I'd waited in TImmie's til they were done instead.  Firstly, the place was less than half full, very quiet and the server was actively ignoring tables. I was literally beside her asking to order and instead of saying \"Back in a second\" she turned around and walked off. So yeah, waiting.  I ordered a pint that was then delivered by the bartender (?) which was Beau's Lugtread, a delicious beer! They actually have a good selection of beers, especially local so I was excited. But that was preemptive, because it was flat. Gross.  She hasn't come by again so I decide to just head to the bartender myself. Seeing that I was headed to the bar she intercepted me and asked what was wrong. I told her it may be the end of this tap, it's flat, she gave me a bit of attitude and said \"You might as well order something else because another pint of that will taste just the same.\" Weird, I thought a bar would want to know when the tap was off (like Prohibition, who were SUPER NICE to me and made sure to fix the problem) I told the bartender and, as I thought, he asked \"Oh, which one was it? I'll check\" after getting me a second beer. Which was also flat.  At this point I felt like my night was a joke anyway, so I ate my fries, (which were delicious) paid my bill and went home.  Cue today, stomach grumbles all day long. Those delicious fries or the flat beer did me in. But this time, maybe my 3rd or 4th visit to Mitzi's Sister or \"The Sister\" might really be my last."}
{"text":"I like this place.   I liked it more when it was Mitzi's Sister. I liked the old bar and the darkness of the place.  I liked the booths against the wall and how busy it was on a live music night.   I had eaten brunch here numerous times before the reno to The Sister.  GREAT for a hangover, prices were reasonable and the kimchi breakfast sandwich is wicked. They also make a decent ceaser.  I live really close, and usually end up at Mezzrow's if I want a drink. IF I want food and a drink, I'll head to The Sister.  Recently I've had the blackened fish tacos, which were fantastic.  My bf had a reuben I believe, which he loved.  Their fries are delicious. Half sweet potato half russet.  We also stopped in last week and shared a lb of wings, which are baked btw.  We ordered the Moroccan dry rub which was AWESOME. A little spicy, you could taste the cinnamon, a little sweet.. and a great crunch.  During that visit we also shared the baked chicken sandwich, which we thought was going to be a chicken breast, but to our surpise, it was a pulled chicken sandwich. Delicious. Sweet and tangy, not too saucy. The bun was fresh and perfect for the sandwich. We were really pleased with the meal.    All in all, I'll definitely keep going back for the food. It's good, the local beer is a huge bonus and I just make sure I leave before the punk bands go on because it's super loud and no my first choice for a live music venue."}
{"text":"I went  to The Sister with my 2 kids and 2 friends from out of town on the weekend for brunch.  One advantage of The Sister is that it is large so we didn't have to wait for a table.  I had the hangover breakfast sandwich which was good and unique but very messy.  The waitress said they didn't have a kids menu for breakfast (really is it that hard to print out a few kids menus?)  but she said the kids could choose from pancakes, eggs or french toast.  My kids had the kids pancake which pretty small and came with a side of potatoes. My kids liked the pancake and would have eaten more but didn't like the potatoes which are a bit spicy and an odd choice for kids (although I liked them).  Again a kids menu would be nice since if I had known that the pancakes came with potatoes I would have asked for fruit or a sausage instead. Our waitress was unfriendly and seemed annoyed and our food took at least 30 minutes to arrive.  The place started to fill up while we were there and our waitress greeted new arrivals by barking \"we have no tables\"  when one potential customer asked how long a wait there would be she said they should look around and figure it out for themselves.   I doubt I will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Heather and I took my brother and his fiance here for a late dinner Saturday night.  We've had a few aborted attempts at trying Mitzi's Sister in the past, so were happy to finally make it in for a bite!  There were live tunes scheduled, and the opener was just tuning up.  There was a couple at the door charging cover for the show.  We had no intention of staying long as we had an early day ahead of us, and when my brother said \"ah, man, there's a cover charge\" the guy immediately asked if we were just there for food.  We answered yes, and he said something like \"no worries, then, come on in, just don't crowd the stage!\".   (We took a seat in the window, well away from the action; I like to think we helped make them look a bit busier than they were!)   So, points scored for being cool and letting us in FoC for food!  Anyway, we got situated and serverman came over looking a bit like a younger, hipper Weird Al, and that's awesome; so far the night's looking pretty good.  We ordered a couple poutines (regular and mushroom), chicken tenders, and I opt for the chicken wings (baked!).  I couldn't decide on the sauce, so Al recommended the Spicy BBQ and gave me some Tangy Suicide on the side to try.  Beer/drinks were had.  Weird Al was amusing in his chagrined admission that they were low on draft options due to renovations.  We dug his style and didn't let the lack of draft variety get us down.  Food arrived and man, those wings looked good!  If I was deeply bummed by the mediocrity of Duff's \"world famous\" wings, I'm deeply impressed by the out-of-left-field-awesomeness of Mitzi's baked offering.  These are tasty wings!  The BBQ sauce was excellent with some decent kick, and I'm pleased as punch.  At less than $1/wing, let me rephrase:  I'm pleased as a jab-jab-feint-hook-to-the-body flurry for the TKO victory.  (While I sampled the tangy suicide, it's... gross -- like really sour shrimp cocktail sauce, seriously.  WTF?  Oh well -- I pushed it aside and tried to forget its existence, which is easy to do because the wings were that damned good.  Whatever you do, don't get the Tangy Suicide sauce!)  Poutines were good.  Not remarkable-good, but good.  C'est la vie.  Chicken tenders were rather tasty, and I'm inclined to say they're the best I've ever had -- but don't put too-too much stock in that, because I'm not a fan of breaded chicken thingdoos and haven't really had broad experience.  These were enough to make me reconsider that, though, tasty as they were.  Finally, I'll close with saying that the same guy taking cover was cool enough to help a hardluck fellow off the street with his bag-o-change, trading for more easily carried (and concealed) bills.  While this may seem weird, I gotta say it gave me the warm fuzzies.  People can be pricks to those less fortunate than them, and Mitzi's vibe is decidedly anti-that mentality.  Doesn't hurt them to do that small nicety, but I'm sure it's a big deal to the man in question.  Good on 'em.  So yes:  Good to great food, drinks (fair prices!), cool service, positive vibe... yeah, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It is a 3 1/2 for me, but three seems to low.   I went to Mitzi's Sister for some beer with friends, they all ate before we arrived. The beer was cold, the service was pretty decent for having one girl running the whole floor. I liked the music, and I liked the dark  dinge of it...Unique Seating... Super Clean  Bathroom too... Good Dive Bar, I'm into it. Food Wise, the food they were putting out looked second to none, and the table of people we were with were raving about the Veg Burger, the Fries, the everything. I am returning here for food based on the incredible food review everyone gave.   TIP: Lots of Veg & Vegan Options on the Menu! Delish!"}
{"text":"Friends and I popped in here after a day at the beach slightly sandy (/haggard) with frisbee and towels in tow-- received zero attitude from the staff about our filth and cargo. How relaxed! We were lucky to snag a seat on their gorgeous back patio, which was hot and sunny, but dappled with shade.   Our server was perfect. Friendly but low key and very attentive. Water glasses were filled without us even noticing, but she joked with us while paying our bill and thanked us for coming.   Beer was affordable at $6 a pint, and they had an interesting special on tap that day, the name of which currently escapes me...something grapefruity. Yum.   Nachos were awesome. Fresh fried corn chips, huge pile of homemade garlic-y guacamole, delicious smokey salsa and refried beans, drizzled lightly with sour cream. There wasn't a ton of cheese, but it was enough and it was lovely fresh and gooey. Quality over quantity-- I prefered it to the typical load of overcooked chewy cheddar  found on nachos are most places! $15. Served with wicked poblano pepper sauce on the side, too.   Good spot. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars + .5 star for ultimate hangover sandwich !!  i actually got my wisdom teeth out a couple of days before coming here so i settled w something soft; french toast . the bf had the ultimate hangover sandwich .   my rating is slightly biased since im korean and absolutely loved the idea of kimchi sandwich for brunch . i dont really love kimchi per se, but when i was little, i used to love eating sauteed kimchi w bread . kinda weird, but it was my thing . taking a bite of that sandwich was a lot more than a bite of a sandwich . :)  my french toast was good but wasnt the best ive ever had . i really did like, however, of the idea of different toppings every week . oh, we LOVED the homefries . i think i secretly liked the homefries more than the french toast itself . and the sandwich .. oh the sandwich was absolutely delicious ! looking at the menu, my bf wasnt so fond of the idea of kimchi in a sandwich, but he ended up getting it anyways . he loved it . my brunch hater bf LOVED it !! i think this is the happiest ive seen him about brunch since the hoofs ! i did have a bite, had my mouth bleed and a piece of bacon stuck between the stitches, but it was worth it . haha :)   so thank you, mitzi's sister, for coming up w the UHS, reminding me of my childhood and making my day . :)"}
{"text":"Mitzi's poutine with lamb gravy is absolutely heavenly.  I little on the expensive side but if shared as an appetizer, totally worth it.  I also have random cravings for their sweet potato quesadilla.  It is filled with tasty bacon and sweet potato... with chipotle sour cream and guacamole on the side.  A filling and tasty meal.  Another favourite of mine are their blackened fish tacos.  This dish is served with 3 tacos brimming with blackened halibut fish, beans and pickled cabbage.  Mmm, mouth watering.  Mind you, this is a large meal.  I typically end up abandoning the flour tortilla shells and just eat the filling."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I haven't been here since 2007, but at that time it was my favourite brunch place in Toronto. Small, with a wait, but the oatmeal pancakes were worth it. And that's coming from someone that isn't even a pancake person. So, there."}
{"text":"Very high quality brunch/breakfast food.   Menu is short and consists of about four specials plus regular items.  You can order things like bacon or individual eggs a la carte though they are not listed.  Food was delicious and prepared with flair.  I felt the prices were a bit high, but quality compensated.  Atmosphere is more like a tavern (which it is!) than a breakfast place but servers are very pleasant."}
{"text":"Service is really slow here. I waited for over 25 mins just for takeout. Definitely not worth the wait. However, they seem to have live music Friday nites, so if you are looking for entertainment and food sit-in is probably a lot faster"}
{"text":"In my previous review, I wrote that Mitzi's Sister served \"meh\" food. This statement doesn't apply to their much talked about brunch. It was so good that two days later, I'm still remembering at how great it was. If you haven't been, do yourself a favour and go. You'll thank me later.   My friends and I met up on Saturday. Though a beautiful sunny morning, it was a tad bit too cold to sit out on the patio in the back and found a spot by the large windows in the front. Aside from having the gorgeous sunshine beam into the place, Mitzi's Sister is one of the best places to people watch. The cast and characters of the neighbourhood will perform before your eyes for free, and will help fuel great conversations. Oh Parkdale, don't ever change...   All of the reviews regarding the food are bang-on: our plates were pilled high and full of tasty awesomeness. My friends ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the spicy eggs with a side of order of bangers.   I opted for the Eggs and Fish Cakes. Recommended by our server, the fish cakes were the perfect combo of crunchiness on the outside and tasty and moist crab meat on the inside. Dipped in hot sauce, they were delicious.   It bears repeating that Mitzi's Sister serves an abundance of food per plate, and all fresh from the roasted potatoes to the fresh cut fruit.   My plan for my next visit at Mitzi's Sister is to fast the day before, thus avoiding the shame of leaving a morsel on my plate."}
{"text":"I met up with a group for brunch here yesterday. The atmosphere is comfortable/eclectic. Their brunch menu is fairly small, but I actually appreciate places that focus more on quality than quantity. As we were drinking coffee and waiting for our meals, we were eying the plates that were headed for other tables. Each one looked great, and it was clear that the kitchen paid attention to detail.   I ordered the eggs benedict ($12) with the hollandaise sauce on the side. I usually don't particularly care for the sauce, but I really liked it here. My only (minor) complaint about the dish was I had difficulty cutting through the english muffin. Overall, though, I was happy with the experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever wanted in a late-day weekend brunch spot.  Delicious food.   Giant portions.   Something involving this magical substance called \"Nutmeg Butter\" and French Toast.  Stellar music for a morning.     But the best thing is the human zoo known as Parkdale right outside the window....    So as I sit there staring at my gorgeous girlfriend, nutmeg butter oozing from my face, I get the chance to stare at transvestite maniacs speaking to themselves.  It is amazing.  Breakfast meets cool bar meets the discovery channel meets a short bus."}
{"text":"Wednesdays you can have 12 buck pitchers and even the shooters are cheap. It's definitely a place for cheap drinks. Oddly enough it was FULL OF BABIES - the pub, not the pitchers.   Wednesday night is not so empty and when I arrived with my friends there was only one girl working at the bar and serving the tables. This was a bit confusing. Then another servers arrived and things got better.   From the menu, the only poutine without mushrooms (WTF?) is the curry-based and it's sooo weird I wouldn't recommend it. Ask for the nachos, they're great. Or the lamb roti! HUGE, dude!   Overall, it's a totally ok place. I'm not sure I understand the baby thing."}
{"text":"I've discovered a new favourite for brunch, the Hangover Sandwich: fried eggs and kim chi, wedged between two thick slices of sourdough bread slathered with garlic mayo (mine sans bacon)!   It definitely takes me back to when I lived in South Korea. One of the few simple dinners I'd get was a fried egg, cooked kim chi and plain white rice. But DAMN, I never knew that kim chi tastes awesome with bread too!  The price tag on the food was a bit higher, but well worth it, since all plates come with fresh fruit and ingredients are top-notch."}
{"text":"Gord and I had some errands to run this morning so we decided to have breakfast out.   Driving along Queen Street W, I passed The Sister and then parked.  I'd heard good things about it.  We sat at the table by the window.  Gord ordered Fish Cakes and Eggs, with a side of bacon.  I ordered the P.L.T., minus the lettuce.  We both noticed that the potatoes were really really salty and way overloaded with herbs.  Gord tried to scrape off the peeling and eat the inside.  I tried dunking them in ketchup.  We both ended up leaving most of them.  Gord said his fish cakes were okay and found the bacon too salty.  He said the best part were the eggs and toast.  My sandwich was just okay.  I couldn't taste any mustard or garlic mayo.  The bottom bun was really really soggy so I ended up just eating the peameal bacon.  Our server, Scott, was very friendly and took good care of us.  We didn't enjoy the food, though, so won't be back for brunch."}
{"text":"The Sister is a low key spot to enjoy conventional, but unboring pub grub. There are wings and then there are finger lickin' Mado's pepper sauce marinated wings. Generously portioned crispy chicken fingers can be sided with half fries and half all dressed salad. Halibut tacos with spicy mango dressing is so colourful both in esthetics and flavour, it's like a fiesta in your mouth.  The beer list is extensive and even features cask ales and limited time offerings on their guest tap. Staff are friendly and very knowledgable.  On a quiet weeknight a while ago, my dinner date and I walked in to find a crowd cheering over a television. Surprisingly, it was not a sports game that was playing, but Top Chef Canada. Apparently, The Sister was the weekly gathering place for friends and family of one of the contenders to watch episodes ensemble."}
{"text":"I really liked the feel of this place; nice, open layout, just the right amount of dimness (I hate eating in the dark), and pretty spectacular french fries.  I had accompanied my friend on a task to research their chicken wings in particular, and though I'm not that big on the dish in general, their sauce (Maple Chipotle, I believe it was called) was delicious. I'm not sure if it was due to our table's light ordering (we split a dish amongst three people, but told her why we were doing it-- research, I told you), but the service could have been a little nicer, methinks. Three people, two glasses of water...but we didn't say anything.  Anyway, even though the time spent in here was a little on the hurried side, I felt sad about leaving before the requisite 2 hours or so (they have a bar in the middle of the room!), and want to go back and make up for it. Next time I'll order my own burger (which was very hard for me to pass up, as it looked hella good), and see if that helps."}
{"text":"Went here with my Groupon for a lazy Sunday brunch and I think I may need to knock this place down a star from my last visit.  I order the rancho huevos and orange juice. The juice was freshly squeezed which was appreciated and the food was not bad but the presentation with disgusting. My meal actually looked like vomit!  The service was also very slow.... we waited over 15 mins to get the bill and another 15 for the waitress to come back and give us change."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Atmosphere is a little dated but cozy.   There is a little bit of a musty smell that seems to go away as you sit...kind of bad to say you just get used to it..that would be my only complaint about the atmosphere. Service was friendly and efficient.  Food portions presented were good size portions and seasoned well.  They use Yukon gold potatoes for their fries...very tasty.  I had the bean burrito and it was delicious served with a side salad.  Must be quite a hang out on the weekends as I wanted a cider but they didn't have any ....it was a Saturday...may be worth checking out at night too.  Son had the burger...cooked nicely with generous portion of fries...and younger one had sweet potato fries.....again generous portion. For dessert (thank goodness we only ordered one as it was huge) had the apple cobbler...not too sweet and not funny like some cobblers can be. All in all a nice lunch (missed the brunch as we showed up after 3). Will definitely try to make it for brunch...all the reviews make it sound fantastic for that time of day!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for years (since it was Mitzi's Sister) and it's entirely possible that I just like different tastes now, but...old favourites...(cue music)...you've lost that lovin' feelin'.  I was at The Sister for a night of music (high fives, NXNE!) and some food.  I remembered the nachos fondly.  I boldly ordered them without consulting any others.  They were...fine.  I mean, chips and cheese and sour cream and beans while drinking beer goes down easy.  But they weren't special, they weren't worthy of my former battle cry \"off to Parkdale for some nachoooos!\".  The curry roti was also good-not-great, though the filling of curried root vegetables would be well suited for a wintery stew.  My favourite bite came care of the cajun halibut tacos: three soft corn tortillas, guacamole, mango salsa, and some (very) heavily blackened halibut.  Paired with a perfectly dressed salad creatively sprinkled with sunflower seeds, this was the dish that I'd re-order.  Our server was a dream, and it's no secret that I love restaurants with booths.  We hunkered down, ate, drank, listened to music...a good night.  Yelp note: without asking, and because we were eating communal-style over the course of the night, our server brought us split bills.  SO HELPFUL (did I mention that she rocked?)."}
{"text":"Look, I don't deal well with change.  & when they redid Mitzi's Sister, they changed a lot of what I liked about it.  I liked that it was a slightly less clean brunch place where we could go & perhaps linger over a NOW magazine.  It is still nice.  Too nice.  Now there are rectangular plates & different plating &... is it just me or did they raise their prices slightly?  Last time we went, we were surrounded by parents with young kids & strollers.  No thank you.  I realize I am complaining about what most people would view as improvements...but like I said - I don't do change very well."}
{"text":"I've been to The Sister on several occasions.  The staff have always been friendly with me.  The ambiance is kind of similar to a family style pub.  In the evenings they dim the lights and you have a candle on each table.  I'm not much of a drinker so I always opt to have a coca cola.  As for the food I've eaten the Spicy BBQ, Medos, and Tangy Suicide Wings.  Out of all three flavors Medos and Spicy BBQ were my favourite.  The Tangy Suicide Wings were okay something with the flavor didn't quiet agree with my taste buds.  I've had the Nachos that come with guacamole, bean dip, salsa and several toppings.  Even for the small size its pretty big.  The poutine here is my absolute favourite.  They use lots of gravy which I love cause I'm a gravy girl.  The curd is about as fresh as you can get outside of Quebec, so no squeak but I don't mind.  Also I always ask for the small poutine which comes in a very large bowl.  It was more than enough to fill my belly, and getting my second order of what ever I decided to order along with the poutine always ends up coming home with me instead of also being in my belly."}
