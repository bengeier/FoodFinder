{"text":"I had my choice between this place, Yours Truly and First watch. I picked Scrambler Marie because I haven't been there before....bad choice.   We stood at the hostess stand and several people walked by without even looking at us let alone saying \"hello\" or \"someone will seat you soon\" so we justs stood there for awhile. We were finally seated and offered coffee and OJ.  About ten minutes later (they didn't seem busy compared to how much help was walking around) our waitress showed up with coffee and juice along with another girl and they literally twirled around each other to set a pot of coffee on our table and the table next to us. She apologized for the wait and took our order.   I got the Mini Classic which was supposed to be eggs, bacon and a mini pancake, and my boyfriend got an omelet with sausage gravy (sounded gross to me). Our food was not good. It wasn't in edible or anything, just not good. And my breakfast was enormous with two huge pancakes......I don't know, having that much food in front of me is nauseating. I ordered the \"mini\" for that reason.  The waitress only came back one time during our meal and asked us how our food was, but she was facing the other table, and then we sat for a long time waiting for our check after we were done.  When we left, no one near the exit said goodbye or anything. I don't need anyone to kiss my butt or anything, but it was just a very unwelcoming place. And the food isn't worth leaving your house.   Stay home and have a pop tart, it doesn't say hello either and the quality is about the same."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Hostess that seated us was not pleasant. Menu selection was great.   I got there around 8:45am on a Monday. Not crowded at all. Waitress was very nice.  Took our order in a reasonable amount of time and food came out within 15 minutes.   Only problem with the food is it was warm - not hot. Part of my plate was actually cold. We were on a tight schedule, so didn't have time to let them remake everything.   I was very surprised that the manager didn't come to our table. They did comp one of our meals, but the fact that the manager didn't care enough to talk to us made a lasting impression on me.   I eat out quite often and whenever I've had a problem, the manager ALWAYS came to the table to talk to me.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back. Food temp is very important and a new restaurant should have been more attentive to this and spoken to me, considering they weren't busy and there were plenty of waitresses, so it wasn't because they were under-staffed."}
{"text":"My family and I went at 2:00 on a Sunday.  We had to wait about 5 min at the door for someone to help us, even though many staff members walked past us.  It seemed that since they closed at 3, the staff were more focused on completing their side work and going home, then dealing with customers.  After we were finally sat it took so long (at least 20 min) before we were able to order.  Once our food came 40 min after that, it was horrible, but the waitress never came back to check.  They forgot one of my daughters food, I had to hunt someone down to go back and check and get it.  By the time it came the rest of us were pretty much done.  My other daughter kept saying her pancakes tasted weird.  I flipped them over and they were completely burnt, like black, on the other side!  I had a burger done medium, and it was horribly burnt and beyond well done.  I can't believe they would let food out of the kitchen like that!  I had to go to the hostess stand to get more napkins and again to ask for drink refills.  A waitress never came around except to drop off our bill and kept walking.  I found a staff member and asked to speak to a manager.  The staff asked why and I told her my complaints.  She said I should have told my waitress, I explained that she was no where to be found and I had to seek staff to get our food that never came, to get napkins, and to get drinks. She went to get the manger.  After 10 min of waiting and being told she was on the phone and would be right out, our waitress appeared with a bill with 15% off.  The manager didn't want to talk to me and decided to take 15% off my bill was how they were going to handle customer service issues.  I will never go back to this place.  Even with the %15 off, our bill was over $40 for 4 people.  Terribly overpriced, horrible/non-existent service, and horrible food!"}
{"text":"Went to Scrambler for Mother's Day, 2017 and Father's Day (today) 2017. Guess what? SUPER BUSY. If you like the food, service and value...you wait your turn. Both days, once waited on, every staff member was very friendly and accommodating. Food portions are generous and all of the 8 and 6 respective orders came out just fine. For a REAL treat, come mid week when not quite so busy...it's even better! Thank you to the hard-working employees."}
{"text":"Just went here for the third time.  Prior two times were enjoyable with decent service and good food.  Today the service was just terrible.  The place was not crowded, but we were asked to give a name ?? The place was practically empty.  We were sat ... The host took our drink order and returned with silverware and said our waitress would be right with us.  In the meantime two other small parties came in. Were seated and ultimately waited on before we had our visit from our waitress... Only to be asked what we would like to drink?? We asked if she could take our food order.... Which arrived 20 minutes later sans pancakes?? I finally got those 10 minutes later after I ate everything else!   No drink refills ... No \"how was everything?\" .... Just one check ok? No ... I won't be back"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! That's about where it ends for this restaurant... Service leaves a lot to be desired. 4 years ago this place was awesome! Quick service and friendly faces. Anymore service is slooooowwwwww, the waiters all seem inexperienced (ours spilled coffee all over my dad's leg trying to carry too much at a time) and unhappy to be at work. The restaraunt is a little dirty overall and makes me wonder about the kitchen. If you're in the area and looking for a good breakfast/lunch I'd recommend driving to Yours Truly down the street at SOM and Wilson Mills."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  Customer service was very bad and when the food did come out, it was over cooked and looked as though it sat for a long time before coming to our table. Oh, and waited 10 minutes for coffee. Never again will I go there."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  Here's my list: 1.  Waited 10 minutes to be seated on a Tuesday morning at 9:45 2.  One order the eggs were wrong.  Second order the meat was wrong.  3.  Waited half hour for food to be brought to the table. 4.  Had to ask for napkins and utensils. 5.  Had to ask for refills on coffee and water. 6.  Waiter mistakenly used my credit card for someone else's bill then had to void that bill.   7.  Never had these issues before what's going on? Too many other places in Mentor to return here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent  lunch, had a burger and salad.   Their salad had very good a lot of flavor.  If you want your salad before your meal comes out, you have to ask, or it will come out with the meal."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how many people enjoyed this place. We were all excited to have a new breakfast place in Strongsville, much to our disappointment this place didn't meet our expectations.  The place is dirty, we found hair in our food, the toast was burnt to a crisp, the pancakes were raw in the middle, our server wasn't knowledgeable, we ordered our meals with hash browns and they told us it would be 30 Minutes Bc they aren't cooked yet. It's a breakfast place! Why don't you have hash browns?  I actually visited here a couple times to give it a chance before I left a review but since our last experience was so terrible I had to finally share. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Seated quickly on a Sunday morning, but waited over 45 minutes after ordering and never received our food. The waitress was un apologetic and tried to bring someone else's order over, however it wasn't the food that we had ordered. Eventually, a manager came out and offered to have our food made, but we had to leave at that point. Disappointing first (and probably last) visit."}
{"text":"Went in today corned beef and hash with eggs was great. Morgan who was the waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday morning. While restaurant was not busy, we waited at the door to be seated while help passed by numerous times.  Restaurant was very chilly, in fact a neighboring table asked them to turn down the air, which they did and it did get more comfortable.  When the food arrived both orders of potatoes (hash browns and potato chunks) were very cold and had to be returned.  Omelet was pretty good, but seemed to be very salty.  Corned beef Hash was so-so and also seemed unusually salty.  It had been a while since we were there (only went because we had a gift card to use).  It will be a longtime before we go back.  Also should be noted that when we left approximately 10 people were waiting to be seated.  A staff member was heard blaming situation on there only being one cook in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wait wasn't bad at all. Service was quick and our server Diana was very friendly and on top of our needs. Food was good. Toast is a little too crazy big. But I got the south of the border omelette and it was delicious. Cooked just right. Hash browns are tasty but a little on the too thin side. Prices seemed pretty reasonable for what we got."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this spot out for lunch recently. We were promptly seated and the hostess was asking us what we wanted before I was even in my chair yet. How do I know what I want to drink? If I am in the breakfast mood, then coffee and OJ. If lunch, then perhaps a soda. Anyways, we both ordered lunch. After nearly 45 minutes AFTER we ordered, our food came. I had the turkey and spinach flatbread. They literally gave me ONE slice of turkey deli meat on the flatbread which was actually pretty good, if they gave me a little more, it would have been very good. My wife liked her avocado and turkey sandwich.  Same issue there! Where's the turkey but they gave her practically an entire avocado on her half sandwich. Overall food wasn't bad, others who came in after us were served way before we ever got our food. The table next to us had some service issue and had the mgr come over to put the fire out.  In the wide cross section of restaurants in mentor, there going to die a quick death if Scrambler Marie's continue to run their operation, scrambled!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their coffee and their skillets! SOOO good. I always get Great service and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Customer service is a joke. Got my sides 20mins before my meal itself. I will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Went to this spot early Saturday morning.  Thought a bowl of oatmeal sounded good with a blueberry pancake.  What  I got was a tasteless bowl of cold oatmeal.....instant??  and a pancake that was raw inside.  The waitress was very nice, but just couldn't seem to get it right.  The coffee was weak too.  Everything about the meal and the experiences was poor and I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER GOING HERE AGAIN.  It also seems a bit pricey...you wonder how people can survive in the business serving this kind of slop.  It really bothered me."}
{"text":"Very rude waitress in the Strongsville location. don't think I will ever go back due to her behavior."}
{"text":"2nd visit in about 2 weeks. First experience was ok. Food was ok. Stood at the hostess stand and it was like bedlam getting a seat. Fast forward to today......very long awkward wait at the hostess stand. Finally got sat. Gentleman asked for our drink orders and never came back. We waited for easily 15 minutes. We saw lots of activity but no productivity. Lots of dirty tables with dishes as well. Servers seemed more engrossed in conversation than anything. Gave up and walked out. I give it 2 years."}
{"text":"Had to walk out yesterday 5 8 3016  Went in at 10:44 am. 3 managers talking. No hostess only saw 1 server. No one greeted us for six minutes. We left."}
{"text":"Tried it this morning and liked it. I had an egg white omelet, which was the same price but only half the size of my friend's regular omelet. Despite the inconsistency, it tasted good. The potato chunks were delicious, but my friend who has dined there before, said they are usually crispier and more well done. I read the reviews about the coffee, but I didn't mind it. Clean, good service, no issues at all. I'd happily go back."}
{"text":"Yikes! What happened to this place?  I would come here a couple times a year but haven't been in a while until last weekend.  The glasses were dirty, the service was sub par, and our food wasn't cooked.  My wife and I both ordered the manhandler skillet.  I thought it was a little odd that there was a mountain of completely raw onions in the skillet but I am not picky so I ate it anyway.  My wife's was ice cold in the middle and we had to send it back because she is pregnant. I thought maybe they just prepared them wrong because who wants to eat raw onions?  When the replacement came back, the meal was almost exactly the same(although not quite as cold in the middle).  There were no apologies, no attempt to win us over, it was just a horrible experience.  I am fairly certain that was the last time we will be going there."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Scrambler Marie's every few months, hoping that they will get their problems sorted out, but this time was a hot mess. The food is fine once the kitchen gets it right, but sometimes that takes three tries. So if you're patient and have low expectations, you probably won't be disappointed too often here."}
{"text":"Came in expecting more than what we got. After we waited in line for 20 minutes I was excited to test out a local breakfast restaurant. After having to ask twice for cream for our mediocre coffee and eating nearly cold food, I will gladly go back to a proven chain like Bob Evans.  Food overall was okay, but nothing to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Wednesday at 1030am, almost 35 minutes for an omelette.  Service was friendly, portions large, but omelette and hash browns were completely overcooked and tasteless.  I don't imagine they were seasoned at all."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast not only is it tasty but huge also the portions will have you taking a Togo box for sure. Not sure about the other food they serve but the breakfast is where it's at"}
{"text":"Service was poor. Food was poor. I never comment on any place I eat but this was a mistake to come here. Real talk."}
{"text":"A good but pricey breakfast. It's a clean friendly environment with a pleasant staff. Bacon is expensive!"}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend.  This was my 2nd time. The first time I was not impressed.  it was the first week they were open. I chalked it up to them working out the bugs.  I decided to try again.  Same results.  I got the South of the Border omelette, which was very good (and hot). However, the omelette came with hash browns, which were cold. Also, I got the biscuit with my meal, which was the worst biscuit I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The coffee is average at best.  I will probably try them again at some point, but right now I'm not that impressed!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I have ever had.  Omelet was greasy and coffee was terrible.  Fruit was dry and brown."}
{"text":"Our family breakfast place is FirstWatch, but it was closed this past July 4th, so we opted for Scrambler Marie's. The two places are very similar in many ways, including the family oriented atmosphere, the decor, the menu, service, pricing, etc.   The one big difference is the size of the portions, SM dishes are huge, seems like twice the size of FirstWatch. Service is decent, and the food was very good.  --------------------- From my better half...  wife disagrees! I give first watch 4 and scramblers 3. Although portions are bigger, and the two places are similar, the decor, cleanliness, newness, and first and foremost the quality of the food is better at firstwatch : ))) (Not to say food is bad at scrambler, but it IS better at firstwatch)."}
{"text":"Scrambler Marie's is a family favorite of mine.  Whenever we're in the mood to grab breakfast on the weekend, this is always a restaurant up for consideration.  The restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch.  The prices are reasonable, the food is good and the waitstaff is friendly.  When I visit this restaurant, I always order the South of the Border omelet.  The omelets come in 3 sizes, and I always order the regular menu size (small is $1 less, and monster is $2 more.)  The meal comes with one side and your choice of bread.  When my wife comes with me, she usually orders the pancakes and only gets 2.  The pancakes are as large as the plate and that's as much as she can handle in the morning.  The coffee is served in a similar fashion to I-Hop, where each table receives their own small pitcher and the coffee is always brewed fresh per table.  Each table also receives a carafe of water with lemon for the table to share.  If you're lucky enough to arrive/order at the right time, a \"blue plate special\" goes out continually through the day.  There is one blue plate in the entire restaurant, and the lucky person who receives their meal prepared on this piece of china receives a free meal.  I have yet to have a bad meal here, and have only had bad service once.  As long as the food continues to come out tasty and piping hot, I will continue to visit here."}
{"text":"We came for the 1st time in a Sunday.  Very busy but not a long wait. They also have call ahead seating FYI. The Harvest Benny was phenomenal and the \"side\" of pancakes that came with the Lite Classic was huge!  Servers were wonderful and food was great! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Our first visit in and as we walked in there were three hostess who greeted us. As one of the hostesses went to seat us, a waitress yelled at the hostess about how she needs to get a table. After our hostess sat us the same lady was our waitress. She was very aggressive in her tone and called us sweetie. She introduced herself as Jackie and that she was going to take care of us today (sadly). I ordered the berry nutty pancakes and my hubby ordered a meat market scrambler wrap. The food came out and I was surprised by the portions. The sizes were HUGE! The food was the nice family style cooking everyone enjoys. After asking Jackie for a box three times she finally came with one. When I thought she also could not get any worse she tried to cheat us on change back. As much as I loved the restaurants scrumptious food I would request any other server then Jackie."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Cleveland, Scrambler Marie's is a must stop for breakfast.  This franchise is part of a small chain of restaurants (most around Columbus) and very convenient to the hotels around Mayfield Heights.  For price and service, it beats eating at a hotel buffet.  I've read through many of the low ratings here, about cold and tasteless food, and in the 20+ visits to this restaurant I have never experienced any of the problems listed.  I have enjoyed their pancakes, french toast, omelets, and other breakfast dishes, and all have been topnotch.  This restaurant is located next to a bank (with a drive-thru) so getting to the parking can be a little challenging to some (follow the road arrows!  LOL!).  The restaurant is very clean and has numerous tables and booths to sit at.  You are greeted at the host stand and sat.  If you have coupons let them know upfront (they recently had a coupon which gave you access to 80s pricing which was delivered in a separate menu).  The wait staff is typically very friendly and attentive.  Like any other type of service, you may get the occasional server who is either new, having a bad day, or just not into the job, but there are enough servers in the place to get help from if needed.  When folks complain they are sitting for ten minutes and not getting any attention, it is their own fault.  Get up and say something!  And there is no excuse in this restaurant as there are plenty of servers!  As I stated earlier, I have enjoyed about everything on the breakfast menu (and have taken sandwiches to go).  The food has always been outstanding and served quickly.  Coffee comes in an insulated pot for self-service.  So when folks say the coffee is stale and cold, I am surprised.  With the turnover in tables the restaurant has, I find it hard to believe that hot, fresh coffee is not constantly being made.  Breakfast is a hard thing to mess up, and with the straightforward menu I also find it hard to believe some of the complaints in the low ratings against the cooks, unless the folks giving the low ratings are regularly dining at 5-star restaurants for breakfast.  This Scrambler Marie's franchise is a well-oiled machine and with every visit I have left with a full tummy and in a better mood than I entered with.  What more could you ask for?  And honestly, I have considered looking into purchasing a franchise as I am that impressed by this one!"}
{"text":"Horrible service . Horrible kitchen. Asked for chocolate chip pancakes and got chocolate banana. Forgot fruit, and pancakes. My friend asked for patties and got links. Bacon is burnt and  hash browns tasteless. Eggs were not over easy. Waiter brought out the wrong order,knowing it was the wrong order and just asked me if I could eat it"}
{"text":"Very disappointed at our experience at Scrambler Marie. It started out well - the hostess was pleasant and they had call ahead seating, which is always a nice option. But it went downhill from there. The food was subpar and the server was one of the worst I have ever had. With First Watch and Yours Truly in the same area with better food and service, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday Morning & walked right in and had a table ready with no wait! The staff was really friendly and the menu had a lot of great breakfast options to chose from aside from your typical breakfast items. I had the open faced croissant & instead of the diced ham substituted it for the chorizo and it was Delish! The pancakes were great and the bacon was perfect. Can't wait to go back and try an omelette or waffle!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place a lot. The food has been really good thus far, great portions on breakfast foods -that's all I've had there thus far- the coffee is 'meh', run of the mill food service coffee is really the only 'fault' I can throw in here. Service is really fast, friendly, courteous etc."}
{"text":"First off, this whole place smells like a dentist office. It's really unpleasant.   Glad I didn't have to pay for the experience since someone else picked up the tab. Not the worst breakfast I've had, but, it's pretty close. Had a party of 6, the wait wasn't horrible, but they won't seat until everyone is there. Ok, whatever.  Three people had coffee, and the rest water. Not sure why 2 pots of coffee was necessary to have on the table. In addition to the 2 pitchers of water there was the silverware and 6 separate glasses of water. Like, what?! The server just ignored the polite decline of seemingly extra items and just left them. Took a while to see her again to take our order. I decided on the South of the Border omelette.   Not a fan at all of how they make the omelettes, and it didn't help that it was well done. Gross. I prefer some density to my eggs so to speak, and here you will get the thin and airy type of omelette. It was really bland, extremely chewy like I was gnawing on rubber, and the cheese was even crispy. I bet the salsa isn't anything special in terms of being homemade. I ate half and gave up.  Tried some of other people's stuff. The bacon was a disaster. Chewy and cold. I call bullshit on the homemade bread pantry. My English muffin tasted like something I would get off-brand from a Save-a-lot grocery store.  This place is not worth venturing out to from here forward. I'm still glad I didn't have to pay for it. But I do feel bad someone else spent money on breakfast no one really liked anyway."}
{"text":"I agree with those who say this has gone downhill....used to love it there, but hadn't been there since last summer ....so told a friend we HAD to go there.Well, the service was pretty bad. And....my friend ordered a meal that was presented on an English muffin. The muffin was BLACK... it was so burned she dared not eat it...they took 20% off her bill when I complained ..BUT I ASK YOU...what chef sends out a BURNT meal to a paying customer ...? When I pointed it out to waitress she looked at me like I was such a pain...she sighed ...and then came back with adjusted bill. Never had a waitress who seemed like we were bothering her. Folks are right..there are better places. Their menu also took a \"nose dive\" in offerings .... so sad, I used to I love this place."}
{"text":"We have been here on several occasions and none of them have been very good.  Breakfast is pretty standard, but not up to even Bob Evans, which is always consistent.  The food was meh, service is ok, there are better options for breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in Scrambler Marie's. I used to go all the time in my teens; it was one of my grandparents' favorite breakfast places. Every time I went there, I had the traditional benny, but the last few times, it was just okay...nothing special like it used to be. I was there a week or so ago with my friends and ordered the traditional benny like I always do. The poached eggs were more like hard-boiled eggs and my english muffins were burned to a crisp - pitch black. Our waitress even told us the table next to us had issues with their food being overcooked (which, honestly, she shouldn't have told us, even if she needed to vent.) By the time I actually got to eat, my friends were practically done with their meals. Unfortunately, I won't be returning, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Admittedly we had a large group of 12. But  it took an hour to get all of our food. And two of he orders were wrong. And all of the orders came at different times. And the bacon was seriously undercooked. Once the.food came it was good. If you had a larger party coming to this restaurant I would not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"So I left 5 stars the first time around, but unfortunately when I came back here I must have gotten the short straw on servers. Our server was extremely rude to us. I waited tables for 13 years and as someone who understands the business, shame on you. I was so insulted by her rude attitude and demeanor towards us that I almost walked out while we were ordering. This woman is clearly burned out and needs to find another job or go on a long vacation. Probably won't be back. The prices are higher than competitors and the coffee is basically colored hot water. Very disappointed, especially after leaving a five star review and recommending this place to others."}
{"text":"My husband and I, we love to have breakfast in \"Scrambler Marie's\" every now and then.  However, we found another place which we like more and we hadn't been there for a while..  We stopped by today and were surprised that the place was not packed (we normally had to wait for a while to get a table).  The host greeted us promptly and took us to a table and asked about our drink.  My husband asked for water and I asked for a coffee.  Then our sever came to serve with a bottle of water and hot tea.  I told her that I order coffee not a tea, so she took it back.  I waited and waited but I didn't get my coffee till I have to ask for it.  My husband ordered an omelet ( Veggie delight) and I took one and one (Half sandwich and salad).  Omelet was fine but my dish was far from OK.  It was actually very dis appointed for me.  My sandwich was a bit mushy but it tasted OK.  My salad was not fresh at all, It looked brown from the top and I found some rotten leaves underneath.  Half of the leave in my salad plate was gone bad.  I completely stunned that they dare to serve their customer with such a food.  So, I asked my server for a new one.  If you think that I should get a good one this time, then you are wrong.  My second salad was bad again.  I didn't ask for a new one, I just tried to pick the bad leave out and put it aside.  However, our server noticed it and she insisted to change for the third one.  The third one was a bit better than the formers.  It wasn't fresh and had some bad leaves.  At this point, nothing can make me enjoy my food any more.  Then the busboy came and tried to took our plate while we still had few last bites.  I didn't understand why they have to be in a hurry to push us out.  The place was not packed and there were available tables for the new guests.  Our server was OK and tried to help us out but our feeling went bad at that point.  I will have to wait for some time to find my courage to come back here again."}
{"text":"First visit here on a busy Sunday morning. We were seated right away which was a surprise. Or server, Chantelle, was the best server we've ever experienced. Friendly, fast, always smiling.  The food was delicious and portions were generous. The atmosphere is a friendly, family type atmosphere.  We will be returning here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Just traveling through. Good breakfast choice, but the service was what made it most enjoyable. Jacqueline was so friendly and made us feel most welcome, it was like we were at her house for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went at 1:30 pm on a Tuesday and had a rude female server who would disappear from time to time to smoke cigarettes as I could smell it on her worse and worse. Food was decent but made our stomachs upset and the sides of bacon are way too overpriced"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here and they fucked up my order and Cathy was extremely rude and fought about how my friends order was messed up and the pancakes were too dry and I ordered extra egg and it never came."}
{"text":"Not a lot of good thing to say about this place.  Poor service, and disagreeable food.  My husband stated that accountants must be overseeing the quality control.  We both ordered fruit.  There were five pieces of fruit in small cups the melon was not ripe and still had a bit of rind on it.  The biscuit was not like anything, I ever eaten before, nor would I want to repeat the experience.  I asked for a cheddar cheese omelet.  They don't carry cheddar in the place.  The mixed cheese that I ordered  omelet was spongy and had a lot of cheese on it.  Husband order quinoa, it was dry.  It was like eating packing material.   In term of service. We asked for water,  it was presented in a carafe.  My husband promptly spilled it. (can't take him anywhere)  We asked the waitress for napkins.  She disappeared and didn't return. Perhaps she thought if we waited long enough it would evaporate. I finally got up and found some paper towels at the reception desk.  A waitress asked what I was doing. I explained that we spilled water.  The original waitress showed up a few minutes later with a handful of napkins.  The service was slow but polite.  The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Had to ask for coffee refills and we were served our meals without silverware.  We had asked five times for silverware prior to the arrival of our food and ultimately gave up waiting for it from the staff and got it from a table who was awaiting their meals. By this point our meals were lukewarm. Then we were served a bill that we paid but the last in our party of nine was stopped on her way to the door and was handed a second bill. The family members we dined with eat there often but will not do so in the future."}
{"text":"We have gone here to eat a number of time. For the second time, after the hostess asked what we wanted to drink, we waited more than 10 minutes for our server to come and ask what we wanted to drink. Food was cold & tasted awful, last time with hair in it. Server didn't care! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Food was bad, tomatoes on my burger were spoiled, I asked to change and brought the same spoiled tomatoes. Wafers were ok, not enough fruits and whipped cream. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. A little on the pricey side for the quality but it has a nice atmosphere. Portions aren't as large as most breakfast places and they have a littttle more of a variety, but I don't think they have anything particularly special. I'd always prefer to go across the street to Fifth Ave. deli for breakfast...cheaper and food is just as good if not better."}
{"text":"The food was average,the eggs Benedict was very salty,deli ham was used, sauce tasted out of a bag. The staff didn't know what they were doing. My grandsons fruit had dirt on the bottom of the dish. I will not come back.."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my boyfriend this past weekend. I liked the food but the overall service there was mediocre. We were told the wait was only 10 minutes, so we were all in. Then after awhile, we noticed that people who came in after us were getting seated before us. So I went up to the hostess after it happened 3x (also I want to note that we were inside the whole time, sitting right in front of them), I went up to them. The guy was like, we called your name and we went outside looking for you. I have no idea if he just whispered it or what, but we were sitting there in front of them the whole time. So I am not sure how we missed it. They then put us at a 2-top in the corner (literally in a back corner), and the table wobbled anytime you put something on it. The server came around like once every 10-15 minute, so that wasn't very helpful either. I got the Southwest border omelette, and I asked for the mini one, but it came out regular. I mean, I would probably go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get back there. The food was good, but the service was not."}
{"text":"Visited recently and the food quality and level of \"heat\" on the plate had improved to where it was when we first started dining here at weekends. The service was also faster and more efficient; so I'm assuming the manager/owner of that location must have changed staff in the kitchen in particular! Will return more regularly if the standard is maintained."}
{"text":"Strongsville really needed a good breakfast spot, and Scrambler Marie's hit a bullseye!  Came in on a Sunday morning at 8:00, just 4 days after they opened.  There was no wait and only a few tables were taken.  I was seated promptly and brought water and coffee.  Both came in carafes, with a lemon (nice touch) slice in the water.  I saw on the menu that their salsa was homemade, so I had to try the Southwest omelette.  Got it with hash browns (crispy) and sourdough toast.  Came out of the kitchen in about 5 minutes.  It was most excellent!  The salsa did not disappoint, with big chunks of tomatoes and spiced nicely.  Matter-in-fact, I got so wrapped around the salsa, I realized I didn't have any meat on the side so I asked for a side of bacon.  Had that on the table in less than 2 minutes.  Needless to say, the food was great and service was fast.  Coffee was fine, but not spectacular.  I feel like Jack Reacher when it comes to coffee.  He would have been satisfied, but not thrilled.  The water, on the other hand, with the lemon and a carafe full of it on the table, was great!  I was going to sit at my table and type this review, but realized a line had formed and people were waiting for tables...all within 30 minutes of arriving.  It may be due to the novelty of the place, but to be on the safe side, get here before 8:00!  Updated on 9/12/15...I was a bit generous with my first review as I recognized there were growing pains this place would have to experience.  I've read the other reviews about rude greeters and poor food quality, so I came back this morning to see if I should change my rating.  5 stars it was and 5 stars it is!  Even better than the first time.  The evil greeter was not there, the proud grandma was, and the food was outstanding!  Had the Ultimate Omelette this morning that couldn't have been better.  Service was friendly and quick.  Need to get back tomorrow to try the waffle."}
{"text":"Worst place I been to in a long time. The service was horrible. Took forever to get waited on. Coffee came out cold. No silverware to stir the coffee for over 20 minutes. We been done for 24 minutes and still haven't gotten our check. Crab cake Benny came out spoiled and remake took 25 minutes to something else. Took the crab cake off the bill but still did not make up for everything that went on. First time customer and last time customer!"}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday, August 30th 2014 around 1:30 PM, and this was not our first time at this restaurant, but this was the worst experience.  We were seated promptly and told the hostess that we received an email about the 1989 pricing special so we could receive the proper menus.  Our server Chantalle came and took our drink order. We then placed our breakfast order.  When I placed mine I had requested that mushrooms be put on the side, as my fiance is allergic, and he could share some of my omelet.  He then placed his order, asked for a side of sausage gravy and biscuits and ordered an omelet. Chantalle asked him what kind of bread he would like, then abruptly said \"oh you are getting sausage gravy and biscuits, you don't need bread\" He responded by saying bread comes with his omelet and he would like it.  He then asked her if the sausage gravy comes on the biscuits or on the side, and she said on, so I asked if you could get it on the side, to which she seem disgusted with  the request.  While waiting for the food to come out, we flagged down the manager to let him  know that my fiances pop tasted off and asked if he could switch to coffee, the manager said no problem. Chantalle brings the pot over with an attitude.  There was a young girl that brought out the order, as she was starting to put the food down, Chantalle loudly says \" there's not to be any mushrooms in that he is highly allergic,\" the server that brought out the food had a look of  embarrassment on her face, and Chantalle went running back to the kitchen.  While I am waiting for my food to come out, my fiances potatoes were cold, and tasted like they tried to recook them. Our server finally comes back out with my food and says there weren't mushrooms in it, but she had them remake it.  I had a small plate with his potatoes on it, and I told her that I didn't want to complain, but the potatoes were cold, and she literally yanked the plate out of my hand.  The manager came by to check on things, and we explained to him that my potatoes were the same way and swimming in melted butter. The manager apologized and brought me fresh, which still tasted like cold reheated potatoes. The manager took over our table, as our server never came back, we saw her walking through the parking lot and found out that she quit.  When the bill came out the manager took off one omelet, never gave us our 1989 pricing, because our server never marked the receipt as such, and we still had to pay for our meals, even though it was all around the most horrible experience we ever had, from the servers attitude, all the way to the quality of food.  Needless to say we will not be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Scrambler Marie's, I normally go to the Strongsville location. Today I was closer to the North Olmsted location so I figured that it would be just as good as the Strongsville location. I was so wrong. The service here is a joke, I get better service from a car wash. Everyone is rude, we were waiting in line to be seating and the hostess ignored us to help a customer behind us look for her sunglasses, when she came back from that the hostess and another server just stood there. We finally were able to get them to seat us. It took awhile for our server to greet us, but she was decent. We were not given silverware or napkins despite asking until after our food arrived. When we finally received it the gentleman just threw it on the table and kept walking, not even acknowledging us. My food was lukewarm at best and my husband had to wait about 5 minutes to get syrup for his waffles.   Everything about this visit was unpleasant and I will not be returning to this location. I highly recommend the Strongsville location."}
{"text":"Went for a late breakfast on Sunday at about noon and we only had about a 5-minute wait.  The place was pretty full, but it's larger inside than it looks from the outside so it didn't seem crowded at all.  They also have an outside patio area where there were several families eating.  It was clean and I didn't get that \"sticky-icky\" feeling at the table...you know what I mean, maybe the table wasn't cleaned properly, or there's syrup on the seat, etc.  Not at this joint.  One of their unique menu items is the \"bottomless\" pancakes.  I could never eat more than 2 or 3, so I wasn't going there, but if you love pancakes, this is the place for you.  They are huge...at least the size the plates they're served on.    All of a sudden we heard bells ringing and the sound of singing growing closer and closer when we realized that it was our servers bringing out our food.  Apparently, one of our orders ended up on a blue plate which translates into a free meal!  That was definitely a welcomed surprise.  So, you never know, if you get lucky and your meal is on a blue plate....it'll be F-R-E-E.   My wife and I both ordered the Classic breakfast: eggs, 2 huge pancakes, sausage (my wife said they were the size of brats; she got bacon) and hash browns.  We ordered my 3-year old the smiley face pancake.  It's 1 pancake with bacon for a mouth, whipped cream for eyes and a strawberry nose.  I also had coffee which I found to be nice and strong; strangely not usually the case at breakfast joints. Everything was great, but the hash browns were just ok.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy, soaked up the syrup nicely and were just great overall.  Maybe next time I'll try the banana ones or the ones with fresh strawberries and blueberries.  The kicker is that I did not finish my entire meal.....I usually finish everything, but there was just so much food.  With the free meal, the bill came to $14.  If the one meal was not free it would have been about $22.  Not too bad.  We'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"First time eating there today. Was very tasty! Nice friendly environment. We had the Traditional eggs Benny, Fiesta omelet, and for the little guy, had a Smiley face pancake! Pricing was reasonable, for the 3 of us was under $30.  Everything we ordered tasted  good! Will definitely go back soon so I can try their breakfast croissant sandwich!"}
{"text":"Eaten here on 4 occasions. Food is good, servers not so much. Sat on the patio which was filthy. Our food came out undercooked but was remade although slowly. Inattentive staff."}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast at the Scrambler Marie's in Canton, MI. I can tell you the franchise is inconsistent. My food was very salty and I was really uncomfortable, too many tables crammed together. I don't think I'd give this restaurant a second chance. Good idea for the area, poor execution."}
{"text":"Had a recent breakfast here with a friend, nothing special but a fairly decent breakfast spot.  I ordered a \"standard\" breakfast meal for me...two eggs over easy, bacon, hash browns (well done) and it also came with two pancakes (instead of toast).  To drink I had coffee.  The meal was sizable.  The two pancakes were on the larger side served with whipped butter and syrup.  They were dense and tasted good.  The eggs were a bit on the runny side of over easy.  The bacon was thick and crispy (how I prefer) but lacked in flavor.  The hash browns were less than well done, which was a bit disappointing.  Coffee was served in a pot at our table, so we could \"freshen up\" at our leisure.  My friend really enjoyed his meal, and although mine was decent this is not a spot I'd probably seek out on a regular basis given the food quality and the price paid (similar to pricing as a Bob Evans, for instance)."}
{"text":"The food is never consistent in taste or ingredients. The particular Sunday we were in, the table behind us had to send their food back twice because it was cold. Our server was not attentive and for as busy as the staff seemed, the restaurant was not even full.  It's nice to have a place that has healthy alternatives on the menu, but there needs to be more training for the front of the house and definitely more consistency in the kitchen."}
{"text":"It's acceptable since there's really no other options in the area, but the it's just standard fair.  It's great they give you a carafe of water, and pot of coffee, but they don't even pour the first glass.  The coffee is very weak, and watered down tasting.  The food was fine, standard breakfast fare, similar to Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! They were more than willing to accommodate our requests and were moderately attentive. Everyone got different things... But everyone really enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food. But the hostess slammed a pitcher of water on my table & walked off. My server was sweet but my food tasted old. Like they put it in the microwave too long, then let it sit to cool down, then forgot about it. Then gave it to me, it was disgusting  I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent! Good prices, delicious food, excellent service. Every time I visit this place I feel home."}
{"text":"Walked in and stood at an empty hostess stand for about 10 minutes. Restaurant was not busy. Nobody acknowledged we were there, said anything to us, or even looked at us. Multiple servers walked by during this time. We ended up walking out. Will never return."}
{"text":"I had seen some low reviews of this nearby breakfast place I wanted to revisit as every time I have gone there it is pretty busy which indicates good food and return customers. When I went today on a Friday at 11am it was busy but I was seated right away. Coffee pot arrived a minute later and ice water with lemon in a few seconds. I ordered their Benny. It came in 12 minutes and was very attractively served an a warm double plate. The home fries were hot and crispy. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly. Instead of typical Canadian bacon this came with shaved country ham that had been grilled before placing under the poached eggs. The table was spotless clean and I noticed that after each customer left the tables were sprayed with a cleaner and wiped dry. The only complaint I had was that it took me about ten minutes to get my bill as the wait staff was busy so next time I ask for bill when food arrives if in a hurry."}
{"text":"had breakfast today.   first impression was that the place was kinda drab. and, the floors were very dirty. while we ate there were usually a few people standing around the front counter. they could have been running a small vacuum.   the food was ok. i got the hash and eggs which was on the lighter menu (for smaller appetites) and it was quite big. the hash, particularly the crispy bits, was really good. i'd also ordered a side of \"potato chunks\" which i didn't care too much for - very salty. i couldn't finish them as i was quite full once i got around to them.   Danielle liked it a bit more than i did but agreed that the floors were filthy. she liked the coffee. i thought it was weak."}
{"text":"Good breakfast around 15$. Great service and an equal opportunity employer. Ryan is a hard worker and I'm happy to see they gave him the shot he deserves."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and we were seated fairly quickly for a large party.  I ordered the Mini classic which was two eggs, sausage link, potatoes and Mini pancakes.  The portion size was more than adequate.  The food was ok and I would return."}
{"text":"We had great service, the waitress was very attentive. The food came out quickly from the kitchen. Lots of options on the menu and everything tasted great! If we're back in the area for breakfast again we'll be sure to head back!"}
{"text":"Great Food, friendly service. We had a great monthly meeting in their side room."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised!  They leave a pot of coffee at the table and served water while we waited. Unlike Bob Evans or other local breakfast places we were met by our server within the first few minutes and breakfast was delivered within ten minutes and they were some what busy. Service was awesome!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Service was slow and unfriendly. Waitress was filthy with stains all over her shirt. My salad had rotten leaves in it,and my BLT had a hair in it. I noticed it before tasting so I'm not sure if it was good. The rest of our meal ,which was  a type of country scramble ,was mediocre and cost $16.00 with two ice teas @$2.50 a piece. I don't expect to see this place in business too much longer."}
{"text":"I want to give this a higher rating, but I just can't because I was very disappointed with my meal and the coffee.  The service is always friendly, and it is a very nice bright restaurant.  That being said, I only recommend that you go there with the intentions of getting a super filling, greasy meal and lukewarm old coffee.    I've had the loaded hash browns, which were great.  But on my last stop I decided to keep it healthy and get one of their omlets made with egg beaters and a fruit cup.  The fruit cup maybe had 3 grapes and 2 pieces of cantaloupe.  The omlet was very dry.  If I tried to eat healthily there again I'd just opt for egg whites.    They bring you a pitcher of coffee, which is great for my family, but I didn't really want anymore as it was lukewarm right out of the pitcher and tasted old.  I have heard they will be building another one in Mentor and I definitely plan on going back to give it another shot.  I love breakfast and we need more places here that serve it.  I just won't wear my skinny jeans."}
{"text":"Service and food gets worse and worse with each visit so today was our last visit. As you can see , in the attached picture , the food quality was poor. A piece of bacon , obviously microwaved, burnt in the middle and raw on the ends. The bacon was served with my  child's smiley face pancake. Service was even worse. When we showed our server the bacon she giggled and said \"oh\". Not even served water , even after we requested it. Not offered any drink refills, and waited more than ten minutes for syrup after being served the kids pancake meal. Nothing like making a child wait even longer to eat!! We ate our last meal there on Saturday morning at 10:30 . We also noticed business seems down as there are many empty tables and booths , but they have people waiting because there are not enough servers or trained servers that can professionally handle more than one table."}
{"text":"I've passed by Scrambler Marie's many times, and I finally got the chance to stop by recently. I was very impressed.   The food is a fine, breakfasty mix of (as you'd expect,) many egg dishes, omelets, pancakes, waffles, etc. All of it is served in a bright, positive environment and the staff does a great job of keeping up (and as busy as that place is, that's no small achievement:)  I had some eggs Benedict that was great, and my wife got French Toast that was just superb.  They keep the coffee coming and the food is really refreshing. I've read that people have had customer service problems, but I guess I must be visiting a different place, because I've been treated well.   The only thing that threw me was how BUSY they are. However, that speaks of how popular they are. Get there early if you can.   If you're in that neck of the woods, and are looking for a quick breakfast , scramble over to Scrambler Marie's and have something that's egg-ceptional:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Scrambler Marie's several times since the Mentor location was opened. Overall the food has been pretty good but the restaurant/service hasn't been anything worth mention. We went this past Sunday for brunch, were seated, orders taken, then we were forgotten. We waited for an hour. Our waitress did not ask to refill drinks, check in to see if we needed anything nor did she stop by to let us know that the kitchen was backed up or offer any explanation as to the excessive wait. We saw a family that was seated after us and served leave the restaurant, so we did as well and went to Panera across the street to eat as we were starving by that point.   We don't expect a lot from a chain restaurant, but this was unacceptable and we will not be returning or recommending. For the amount of our time that was wasted, we could have gone to Tremont for Johnny Mangos or Barrio's brunch (and paid the same price for better food); next time we will. There are too many other options in the area to drop the ball like that especially to local customers."}
{"text":"The service is good. Everyone is nice and polite and the food came out quickly. The eggs and bacon weren't bad, but also weren't better than what I could make at home.   The banana pancakes had granola in them and were huge.  My partner ordered corned beef hash. It was very salty but good.  I will return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just awful. I had the chorizo skillet. $9 for a pile of tasteless cubed potatoes with light cheese and little else...except for the old English muffins they served me. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible staff. I'll admit I haven't been there in over a month, but this was our favorite place in Mentor, and it's a huge disappointment in Strongsville. The waitresses have been pretty terrible. We are an everyday breakfast out couple and we expect kindness and not the feeling that everyone is freaking out."}
{"text":"I had gone to this location once before today, and didn't remember the food and service (management) being so rough. My boyfriend ordered a Club Sandwich and I got the Mini Classic with banana nut pancakes. The food definitely took a while, considering it really wasn't too busy, but we weren't in much of a rush so we didn't mind. When we got our food, I noticed I received cranberry pancakes instead of banana nut. She took them away and told me she'd bring the ones I ordered. While waiting, I ate my eggs and sausage link (a little too raw, in my opinion). The pancakes were brought over and as I was starting to eat them, I noticed batter was running all over my plate. The pancakes weren't cooked at all! I could've gotten pretty sick. By then, my boyfriend was done with his sandwich (which was basically 70% bread) and I didn't feel like waiting for my third round of pancakes. She told us her manager took off what a pancake would've costed ($.99) and I felt that was ridiculous. My meal was $9 and all I was able to have was two eggs and a raw sausage link. (Also, the couple of tables around me were complaining about undercooked food, as well...) I left extremely disappointed with management's decision and still pretty hungry :( I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been a patron at the Hilliard Rome Rd location for about a month. Great service every time. My last visit was my best. Stephanie was my server,and did an excellent job. Including good conversation. Ollie the Manager was very engaging as well as I told him about Stephanie. My steak and eggs with a bacon side,was prepared just as I had requested. Between rare and Medium rare. Patrick D."}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast.   Server was attentive not annoying. Pancakes are HUGE.   Not too loud.   Plenty of seats."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The service has definitely gone down. Went on a Saturday morning today around 10am with my brother. We were seated right away which was great.  The waitress was present but not super friendly. When we received our coffee, there was a few particles of old food stuck to my mug on the outside so I was concerned at what might've been inside the mug before she poured the coffee.  The food though, was good. Not great, but good. And it was plated nicely, it looked pretty good. It came out quickly. I'm not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast place - I wasn't expecting much. Food isn't too unique or anything, but it's pretty good. I've had the Meat Market Scramble Wrap and the Westgate skillet. The side of hash browns is a bit sad, though. Some people in my party can vouch for the pancakes and hot chocolate, although someone didn't like their Harvest Benny very much.  The service can be hit or miss, some servers seem much more attentive than others. It has noticeably improved since the first time I went, though, when it was fairly new. This place always seems a bit cramped, both the waiting area and the seating.  Anyway, I would probably eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it or be overly excited about it."}
{"text":"Service was great even with a crowded restaurant. Food delivered quick and accurate. Knowledgeable staff and most importantly, food was great. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, reasonable prices, never ending pancakes are great as are the sausage and home fries, very good coffee and excellent service."}
{"text":"I usually don't complain, but the food was terrible and it took over 15 minutes for anyone to come up and even acknowledge that we had sat down."}
{"text":"Food was not hot.  Taste was okay, but a little salty.  The one small bit of mushroom was not cooked.  That was all the mushrooms there was.  Had a breakfast skillet. Toast was burned on one side.  Used rest of gift card.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Made my 3rd visit to Scrambler Marie's on a Friday morning and had a great meal. We only had to wait 3 minutes to be seated. Our server, Riley, was excellent. He was friendly and attentive.   My husband ordered the spinach + portobello omelette with an English muffin + potatoes. I ordered the pastrami sandwich with fries. The pastrami was delicious. Some of it was charred, and I mean that in a good way: it gave it a wonderful, smoky, crisp flavor! The fries were excellent, much better than previous visits. Perfect crispness + I only has to add a little salt. The only \"problem\"? They give you too many fries! I didn't want to take fries home so I felt \"compelled\" to eat them all (I didn't!) - It's not really a complaint, Scrambler Marie's, don't change anything about your fries.   I like how the tables have the usual condiments like salt, pepper + ketchup, but they also have Frank's Hot Sauce, which I tried for the 1st time that day (with the fries)   Great job, Scrambler Marie's."}
{"text":"Scrambler's is a fantastic new business in Strongsville. They offer a large menu, and all of their products are good. The pancakes are huge, and they provide you with more than enough food. Scrambler's has call ahead seating which is helpful, but even just walking in isn't a problem; if you don't get seated right away, you will only have to wait 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere is better than Bob Evans. The layout makes it seem less crowded, and the colors make the restaurant more vibrant. Also, the location is ideal. It completely avoids the traffic in the center of town. Scramblers is worth your time, and I definately recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"The service was lacking to say the least. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. Not sure I would ever go there again when we are in town"}
{"text":"First time at the location. Food is eh.  Coffee served in carafe started out barely warm. It was about 11:30 during the holiday week so they were busy, but lots of empty tables just no one to bus them I guess.  My real issue was with the design of the entry and table layout.  If you use a walker or wheelchair, there's not a lot of clearance.  I saw one group with someone using a walker come up to the door and turn around and leave.  This location is fairly new.  Accessibility should be incorporated into the design, not an afterthought!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, impatient and inattentive server. Mediocre food not worth the price. Our server surprised us with a 50% discount on the bill. It was a nice gesture but I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey club, not only was I disappointed that it was on chabatta bread but instead of toast it had one piece each of turkey and cheese with 2 pieces of bacon, and the bread was hard. My friends eggs benedict were cold and the muffin wasn't fully toasted. Next time, it's a small breakfast diner for us."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast numerous times and have not been disappointed! Definitely will make this my favorite breakfast spot will try lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast/lunch spot!  I dropped by there with some co-workers and had the Sausage and Egg Omelet with some hash browns and a whole grain muffin.  The prices are a little high but you get huge portions.  This is enough for breakfast and lunch leftovers.  Additionally, many of the menu choices offer Half portions which is a perfect size for breakfast.  The in-house coffee is tasty and not ridiculously strong or bitter.  Stop in and enjoy!  I can tell you that they have a really large menu with a multitude of unique dishes.  I will try lunch the next time."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  My husband ordered the BLT with no tomoates. It had tomatoes. My hash browns and eggs were cold. We had the misfortune of being seated next to the server station near the kitchen. Missy, our waitress, was upset about an interaction she had with someone in the kitchen and let every server who would listen know about it. We had to hear several times how unhappy she is. Not a pleasant experience.  I will give it another chance. Fingers crossed we get a nicer & happier waitress. Oh and it would be even better if our order is correct (and warm)."}
{"text":"Won't be back. Waited 40 minutes for our food to come out. When we finally got our food, the French Toast was cold. Potato chunks were soggy. They forgot to bring out the \"mini\" pancakes our friend ordered, and when they did, it was way overdone. And I say \"mini\", but they were the size of normal pancakes. Go across the street to First Watch instead, maybe you'll get better food and service over there."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with a friend before a round of golf a couple weeks ago. My friend recommended it and said he'd eaten here before and it was good. Unfortunately, I can only review it based on MY experience.  We were seated quickly and had a waitress stop by immediately. She took drinks, quickly brought them back and asked if we were ready. We said we'd like a minute to look over the menu--she said ok and walked away. 10 minutes later another waitress came over and asked \"Do you want me to take your order?\"...apparently the previous waitress had either forgotten us or chosen to ignore us. No matter, we gave our pretty basic orders to the waitress. They were:   1. Biscuits and gravy, side of hash browns 2. Biscuits and gravy, side of bacon  A seemingly simple order apparently threw the good people of Scrambler Marie's for a loop. After 15-20 minutes our food shows up. The hash browns were warm, crispy and yummy. That's where the acceptableness ended. The gravy on the biscuits was legitimately cold--not lukewarm, not room temperature--cold. My friend's bacon looked like beef jerky. It was 3 pieces of bacon...they seemed like they had sat on the grill for 5 minutes too long and had burned and glued together. There was literally only one acceptable item on the table.   The manager came over and we sent it back. He still charged us for the coffee and hash browns--which struck me as sort of odd. Yes, I did eat the hashbrowns and drink the coffee. It was hardly worth the $5 for the experience I had and considering we had to then go play golf without eating, seemed he probably should have just cleared the bill for us."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast and I must be honest I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. It was packed but it didn't take long for us to get seated at all. The food was really good. I had pancakes and eggs. The pancakes were huge and delicious! I couldn't eat them all and had to take a to go box. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! The customer service was good as well."}
{"text":"Got seated and ordered coffee, no silver wear at the table  to stir and surrounding tables were dirty, waited for about 20 minutes for our orders to be taken all while making eye contact with our server and the hostess. After 20 minutes of no one coming to take our order we walked out."}
{"text":"Just your average breakfast place. Compared to Denny's , bob Evans , or the crappy Cracker Barrel. If I am really hungry or now that I am pregnant this place is great !!!!! Otherwise there is nothing special that stands out here !!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, bad coffee?!?  Went on a busy Sunday morning.    A 10-15 minute wait went quick.  We ordered the Farmer's Benny and a Crab Cake Benny.    Both a spin on the traditional Eggs Benedict.   We both enjoyed dish.  The flavors were well balanced and the portions were pretty fair.    The coffee on the other hand was terrible!    Way too strong and even asked for a second carafe hoping that it was an isolated pot that was sitting too long.   Nope.  Neither of us had more than one cup.   Odd for a breakfast restaurant to have terrible coffee.    Service was good and we'll give it one more try."}
{"text":"Price is high, food quality low. Ordered vegetable egg white omelette, but it was swimming in cheese.  The hash browns tasted like they were fried in week-old oil.  Inside is nice, but that can't forgive the bad food."}
{"text":"I want to like it as it does have a First Watch vibe and seems clean and professionally decorated as others have mentioned, but it's just barely ok. I got the American breakfast scrambled with the chunked potatoes. Eggs were good, toast was about 3 inches thick and required a considerably higher fake butter to bread ratio than was provided to be edible. The turkey sausage was the frozen institutional variety and the potato's were easily made last week and reheated each consecutive day in anticipation of my arrival. Service was prompt, but not all that friendly as he seemed to be doing all the jobs from seating, serving, bussing tables and running by the register. Pass on this chain unless your ok with just ok."}
{"text":"We have been here several times with our family and the food has consistently been very good.   We have had exceptional service all except for on one occasion.  We had a younger female server that treated us like we were a great inconvenience to her,  she had some type of attitude issue and we could hear her complaining about the other people she worked with in the dining room in front of a packed restaurant.  Had this been the first time we had ever been there I probably wouldn't have gone back. The other times we attended this restaurant the service was absolutely fabulous and we were handled with experienced servers.  Overall a good experience  at a restaurant Strongsville desperately needed!"}
{"text":"We had to wait over 20 minutes for coffee. The hostess asked what we would like to drink as she seated us and we asked for coffee. It never came. The waitress took our food order then asked us what we wanted to drink. Again we asked for coffee. It never came; however a table next to us received their coffees when they were seated after us. Our waitress walked past us several times without bringing our coffee. We finally had to ask for our coffee for a third time. She finally brought it three minutes later.  Our server then said our food would be right up and about 15 minutes later it finally arrived. Our table wasn't the only one to have issues. Another table received the wrong meals from what they ordered and then their bill was messed up too. The restaurant was not particularly busy. There was no reason for this poor performance.   My wife and I come here often, but with today's experience I will think twice."}
{"text":"If you want basic breakfast done better than you'd ever expect, this is the place. Newly arrived in Cleveland, was looking for a breakfast place for a husband who likes bacon & eggs and a wife who likes to be a little more adventurous. Scrambler Marie's made us both VERY happy.   Arrived Sunday at 10 to a 20 minute wait. Grabbed some free coffee and sat outside -- came in after about 15 minutes and barely sat down on the bench before our name was called. It looks crazy, but they know their crowd control.   If you order coffee - you get a carafe, if you order water - you get a carafe with a lemon slice ... anything else the staff was quick with refills. We never saw the bottom of a glass. Nice.   First, the Bottomless Pancakes -- special order with pecans, fresh bananas and blueberries. Will NEVER do that again -- because the first plate is a huge serving I could not finish. I'll go for a short stack in the future, but these were good - hot, light and buttery - with tons of perfect fruit. Standard fried eggs with bacon is elevated by their choices of breads and sides -- you pick what you want ... again, nice!   Had planned to check this place out, so I joined their on-line club and got an email welcome coupon for Buy 1 entree, get one free - but even without the coupon, the total bill was reasonable for the portion sizes, the service and the smiles. One last thing - the owners were there, keeping the young staff on point and even delivering our food. They also celebrated when a diner received a blue plate (which gets a 'mini party' and the item is free. Again, just lots of nice touches that really took everything up a notch or two. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love pancakes, so my rating is primarily based on this. I would say IHOP is much better tasting and nearby Denny's is comparable but way cheaper. Enjoy my fellow pancake enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"This is more of a general review. Out of the many times we have dined here only one time I was dissatisfied with the service. The restaurant was packed and service too slow. Other than that time service and food have always been good. I recommend the turkey burger and the spinach omelette (actual name of it escapes me but is one of the lighter options on the menu). I must agree with other reviewers as far as the coffee goes, very gas station like."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is subpar and the service was all over. We had three different people serving us at the same time, it was crazy. There was no organization. It took us about 15 minutes to get our water and they'll give you enough cups for everyone there and a jug of water. So the problem with that was that the cups were in horrible shape. There were egg remains in both and they reeked. When we got two more \"fresh\" cups only one of those was actually clean. The other again reeked of egg and was greasy. The food wasn't anything special, they make their omelets with egg whites which wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time after church.  Only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  I ordered the \"classic\", hubby ordered a sausage & cheese omelet.   Mine consisted of scrambled eggs (fluffy) potato chunks ( average) and bacon (very yummy) and two HUGE pancakes ( awesome, but I couldn't finish and I'm not some lil bird eater!). Service was decent, but I get spoiled by servers in the south.  They give you a carafe of water w lemon ( nice touch) & they also gave us a carafe for coffee.  Hubby said his omelet was good, but could have used more sausage.  He said the hash browns were good.  They were out of biscuits when he ordered, so he switched to an English muffin.  I think we'll come back again!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant server and the food is consistantly good. That keeps me comming back"}
{"text":"I get take out from here every now and then and have eaten in with my family.  The Foods been good as has the service. I'm surprised to see all the other negative reviews."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this place but had a bad experience today waited 35 mins for me and my daughters food, I realize today is Saturday , but I sincerely think the waiter forgot to put our order in. Hope my next time there it doesn't take forever, forgiving since this was the first time I've had to wait that long even on a weekend"}
{"text":"Scrambler Marie's is a chain breakfast centric restaurant...this particular one opened in a location that doomed everything else that ever dared set down stakes there.     I am on crutches so I ventured out of the house for the first time in 11 days for some real breakfast.  I was impressed at the front door.   James, a server there that trains dogs (some flair for the nametag) rushed to get the door for gimpy ol' me.   God bless him for the help.  My dad and I were sat and the server was on us like bees on honey.  And it was quite busy for a Wednesday at 10 AM.  Coffee came in a carafe, but it tasted a little...weak.  That was where the weakness ended.   The menu is vast;  I needed 5 minutes to peruse.  I got the \"mini\" all American;  Two eggs, scrambled, turkey sausage patty, fruit, and two pancakes.  That was the MINI.    Eggs were perfect, and had a little cheese in them;  you wouldn't notice it unless you were looking.  Just perfect.  The turkey sausage patty was a little salty for my taste.  The fruit consisted of grapes, cantaloupe, melon, pineapple and orange.  Not a whole lot, but enough to head off the guilt of the pancakes.  They have unlimited pancakes and french toast;  not available on this order but if you just order pancakes you get unlimited.  Crazy.  Overall it was clean, busy, and if they fix the coffee it'll be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We tried it out one morning since it was new to us and wow. It looked fairly sterile and like a cookie-cutter restaurant, but everything else is just flawless. We were seated immediately. They gave us our own carafe of water with fresh lemon, and one for coffee so we could help ourselves. I dunno why, but I really liked the fact that they did that. I wanted to try something unique, so I tried something called the Wisconsin scramble.  The Wisconsin scramble was a bowl of scrambled eggs, but it was like an orgasm in my mouth (sorry to be crass.) The eggs had three kinds of cheeses and sour cream. Sounds bad, but it was heaven! It came with a side of hash-browns, the shredded potatoes kind you see at just about every other breakfast place anywhere. The thing about these that made them special was how crisp they were! I have never had them like this, It's hard to imagine having them any other way though once I had the first bite. The meal also came with 2 large slices of wheat toast, which was a step below something form a bakery!   The waitress was incredibly attentive, and the food came out in lightning fast speed. 4 hours since I ate there and I'm still thinking about it. Portion wise, I thought it was perfect, I couldn't even finnish all my food. To swoon even further, the breakfast was a total of 6 bucks, very reasonable!  Next time I go back I think I'll try the botomless waffles, or pancakes that I saw on the menu. This place was safe!   5-stars! ** Apparently this restaurant is only open until 3PM, and is mainly breakfast chow as the name implies. There are some burgers and lunch items on the menu though. **"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes. Portion was HUGE. Not enough chocolate chips for the huge pancakes.   Service was okay.  Waited 15 minutes to be sat."}
{"text":"First time here, came in for breakfast. I have to say not impressed from the very start, first of all in the forties outside however it's freezing inside they still have the air on?? Took forever for someone to bring us our drinks even though we were asked when we were first seated. The server seemed frazzled and non apologetic when we explained to her that we were sitting here for a long time before anyone even came over to bring us our drinks or take our order. The husband and I both got skillet breakfasts, average at best. The moral of the story here is save your money and pick somewhere else to have breakfast or lunch- this place is not worth your the time or money. P.S couldn't wait to go outside and warm up from the frigid temp in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this because we used to go every single week because we loved the food so much but this place has gone so far downhill with the customer service within the past year. There is a new manager or dictator who you will find upon the hostess stand always yelling at the young girls. The young girls used to be so happy and nice and now I can tell they're upset because this lady (short haired older woman with brown hair) We asked for a booth there were plenty but we were seated at a two person table. Tiny. Uncomfortable. We could see several booths on the other side that were open and clean but she insisted we be sat in that specific area.By the way all their went up ! The food became of lesser quality and higher costs recently on their new menu !!!!!!!!! Can't say we will be back, and it makes me very very sad."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh......I love places with low quality food. The cold rubbery bacon, the pool of butter on which floated burnt hash browns, the made from microwave biscuit and the ambivalent service with a scowl makes for a remarkably disappointing first visit to this establishment. The only redeeming grace that helps to boost my opinion from a one star to a two star is their pancakes."}
{"text":"Also known as Scrambler Marie's. The hostess seated us at a rickety old table and the waitress kept coming to the table to take our  order only to interrupt herself to leave and come back again. Weird. They put a pot of coffee on your table. The restaurant is clean and well decorated and the prices are good. Food is good. I like the Americana that comes with a sampling of scrambled eggs, sausage, English muffin and fruit.  Fruit looked like it was cut the day before but edible. Hostess thought process on how she was seating seemed illogical. No worries. Decent breakfast for about 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Vegans beware. I joined friends and family here. Why did I have to spend a long time explaining to the server a vegan lifestyle?  But she still did not get cheese and milk. Never again"}
{"text":"This was our second visit since they opened and both times were disappointed.  Can only attribute it to whoever is running things.  We like Scrambler Marie's as a chain, but this store needs some attention.  We totally agree with a previous review about the coffee.  Like boiled water it's so weak.  On our first visit, my wife's French toast only cooked on one side and had very little egg in the mix; like eating moist bread.  Her hash browns were burnt black on the underside of the pile.  We didn't discover this until we got home as she got them to go.  On our second visit, I ordered the Farmers Son and had the most bland sausage gravy I've ever had...like wallpaper paste.  No flavor whatsoever.  As a side, I got some burnt, \"thick cut\" bacon that was like eating a stick of salt, with barely any bacon flavor.  It was of the texture of meat that's been over-done in a microwave .  What REALLY got me pissed is that I was charged $4.49 for that pile of pine bark.  I so much wanted to address these complaints with our waitress, but my wife felt she would take it personally, so I restrained myself.  I sometimes embarrass my wife beyond what should be legal, so this time I thought I'd stick to limiting my thoughts to Yelp.  I sure hope this store gets itself together, as they are so close to us."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey club wrap and got one slice of turkey, two slices of ham, and one slice bacon in a white tortilla. Weird since the description read turkey, bacon on a tomato basil wrap... I've tried at least 7 dishes hoping that it will just be that I've tried the wrong items.... French fry oil must be very very very old, inedible French fries due to the very old oil taste. Sad since French fries are my guilty pregnancy pleasure! All around very disappointing way to spend $10 and a lunch break."}
{"text":"I was nervous about going here due other Yelp reviews. Fortunately, our experience was ok.  I appreciated being able to get a table for six on a busy weekend morning. Waitress was very friendly and accommodating of us, considering we had two kiddos in two.  Food was what you'd expect. I had one of the French toasts - it tasted like I'd expected. I appreciated being able to add some fresh fruit as a topping. Bread was a little dry, but nothing to complain about.  In terms of chain breakfast spots, I've had better, but I'm hoping this experience is an indicator that they have improved on some of the complaints in previous reviews."}
{"text":"Never again. I wanted to like this place and have given them a couple of opportunities. Went to lunch with a co-worker. Greeted quickly, seated and asked for our drink order. The highlight of the meal was the large icy cold carafe of water with lemon. Waited, waited to order. Waited, waited for our food. Co-worker's order is missing the corned beef hash side, no syrup for her pancakes. Mine is missing the toast which I was assured would be right out. I ordered a chicken fajita omelet which is missing the salsa said to come with it. Waited, waited for my toast. Nada. Asked for my toast, waitress seems confused and goes, I thought to get it. Nada. Meanwhile I'm eating my heart attack inducing eggs with at least a pound of cheese on it. No toast, ask again. Finally get my toast, which I had asked for dry. I like to butter my own toast as restaurants seem to think you should soak them in butter until reduced to a soggy wimpiness. Guess what?! Toast is soaked to a soggy wimpiness. Which is a shame as it was a nice thick slab of grainy goodness. I'm not sure what is going on here. If the kitchen is f'in up, shouldn't the waitress at least ensure that the order is coming out complete? I'm starting to think that we are seated in the back corner where this waitress is because people will ask not to be seated there. She seems more interested in carrying on lengthy conversations with other patrons. I pride myself on tipping well, because you know, waitresses make minimal money. I don;t recall ever, ok, maybe once, leaving a crappy tip. In all honesty, I left a dot over 15%, which she trully didn't deserve. And...of course...we were late from lunch."}
{"text":"I liked the food here, but it's expensive. It feels expensive too, the portions are not as large as you'd expect and it's pretty standard breakfast fare. The coffee was good, but I wish the server had brought cream or sugar so I didn't have to steal it from another table."}
{"text":"Service was great and quick. Food came out fast and good. Would come back and would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  Crowded and a little noisy, but every table with a diner or two.  Highly recommend.  Skillet breakfast was very tasty.  Coffee carafe on the table, which was a plus."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal, and Scrambler Marie's has never let me down.  Compared to Bob Evans, I find Scrambler Marie's to be fresher tasting with a vast menu to satisify anyone's breakfast desires.  The omlettes are my favorites - especially the gravy train and the avacodo.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Kinda recommended lol  Overall it was solid enough breakfast. It has the feel of first watch, but with more cheese :) It was bright and clean. The food was ok, coffee ok, service was slightly subpar. I got a scramble and took half home, so I'd say value was good. Solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Great down home atmosphere.  The best French toast around, good coffee not the watered down junk.  Always the best place in Strongsville for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and got on Yelp and found this little gem.  A short wait on a Sunday morning and an awesome waitress (Patty) helped us with our meals.  Both meals were fantastic, hot and tasty!!  Both of us looked at each other and said this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. The service was fast, and the staff were all cheery. The menu had enough good sounding choices to make me have a hard time deciding. The south of the border omelet I had was very good, as we're the hash browns that accompanied it. Portions were pretty large, and the price was reasonable. I definitely expect to go back to try a few of the other things I saw."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Help yourself coffee and water on table was great.  Food worth the price - $7 for omelet.  Typical breakfast menu.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Had an appointment nearby so popped in for breakfast. Let me just say that I DO NOT LIKE EGGS so I was hesitant to try a place with \"Scrambler\" in the name. However, was nice to see they had many options on the menu not affiliated with eggs. I believe I got a Power Bowl which had quinoa, etc. It was pretty good. My server was a very young girl who was extremely nice & polite. The prices are a little high though."}
{"text":"To sum it up, the toast came after the meal was done. Completely disorganized. Couldn't give an estimated wait time for a party of 8. It would have been longer than the 45 minutes it took if we had not check up with hostess.  Bland food. Handed the plates to us instead of setting them down. Indifferent staff. Not apologetic."}
{"text":"They always have good breakfast here but the prices here are a little on the high side for what this place offers.  Very similar to Perkins or Bob Evans but the prices are significantly higher.  Other then that it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with our daughter and her husband and 1 year old grandson.  Took an hour to bring their food.  I never got mine until everyone was done and the little guy was beyond ready to go.  All the food was cold and didn't get several items we asked for. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The service here was great. We were seated quickly, and water and coffee pitchers are left on the table. Food was served quick, even though they were slammed. Everything tasted good, even if the sausage gravy was a bit cold. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The wheat toast was my favorite! Very fresh and fluffy!  The egg whites were pretty good too! I had them topped with cheese."}
{"text":"The place was packed when I arrived 10:30 am on a Saturday.  I'm staying in the area for a work assignment for the next six months and thought I'd try out his place that I have never heard of before.    I waited about 15 minutes then was seated at a very small table.  My #1 gripe about eating out alone is that I am seated in small, uncomfortable locations.  If the place weren't so packed I would have asked to be seated where I wasn't jammed in the corner feeling like I'm eating off a TV tray.   The service was absolutely excellent; everyone was friendly, professional, efficient.  The menu had a wide selection to choose from.  I settled on the Harvest Benny - eggs benedict with spinach.  The eggs were cooked perfectly; the sauce was a perfect hollandaise mixture. I opted for fruit instead of potatoes; the fruit was plentiful and fresh.  The coffee was OK.  I'm not a fan of being served a carafe at the table because it rarely keeps the coffee hot and it takes up space on my TV sized tray table but it was OK.  I must have been hungry because I ate all of my food and found I had room to try their pancakes so I ordered a kid size portion of 3 cakes...very, very good!   I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  I called in advance explaining we had six adults and two children.  We were a family rarely together and I wanted one table.  I was told it would not be an issue, and she would mark one table reserved.  So they seated us at two tables; back to back.  To try and correct the situation, I asked for the manager.  Ten minutes, and three requests later, a young man purporting to be the manager came by and said \"Hi, Buddy.  What's the problem?\"  I explained that I was very disappointed, and that we had sat long enough moving was not an option.  He said OK and danced away.  The food was adequate, when everyone was served their meal.  My son and his partner waited ten minutes to get their pancakes after the rest of us were served.    We could have gone to many breakfast places in North Olmsted, and I wish I had suggested another."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at this location before and I'm glad because every part of our visit sucked.  Service...terrible.  Never actually got our food until we complained and my plate was ice cold. My wife's eggs were cold but her underdone hash browns were piping hot -like they tossed them on the grill last minute OR microwaved them.  We walked out after being there for nearly an hour. Our shitty server was...well, shitty and stupid. We actually gave it more time than we normally would to get our meal. Left it all right on the table while the stupid server gawked at us.  I usually visit the one in North Olmsted and it's always great - this one.....noooot so much.  Now we're on our way to have breakfast. #hangry"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. The selection was amazing and the scrambler I got was out of this world delicious. Big portions and inexpensive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"When cooked right, the food is really good. It's your standard breakfast joint, much like Denny's or Bob Evans. Price for portion size is reasonable. The atmosphere of the dining area is colorful and clean. However, I don't eat in often, as I work across the street. So I usually get a carry-out; with which the wait times are just as reasonable as their prices.   Unfortunately, my actual experience with Scrambler Marie's food itself hasn't been so great. Several times I've ordered with high hopes, only to be disappointed with runny snot like egg whites, cold sausage links, and rock hard taters.   I might give them another chance, eventually. In the meantime, there are plenty of other places in the area to satisfy my taste for eggs."}
{"text":"Don't bother going to Scrambler's on Sundays. You'll stand for 45 minutes straining to hear if your name has been called only to be told they gave away your table 10 minutes ago.  Asked why a buzzer system isn't used, we were told people are too packed together for the buzzers to work. Recommend against spending your Sundays this way."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Breakfast galore, all you can eat pancakes, french toast and waffles. Yummy"}
{"text":"Has unfortunately gone downhill since opening. The wall next to us to was splashed with hot sauce, there was a fruit fly in the salt shaker, food was very greasy and service is sub par. Wish it was better since it is SO convenient!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!  Always a good sign when the place is packed!  Love that they leave coffee and water pitchers at the table  The sausage was incredible.   Nothing we had was bad.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day. Called ahead at 1020am for seating for 11am - arrived at 1105am. We planned on breakfast since many of us had to work today.  We were told 20 mins upon arrival for wait time. An hour later (1:40 minutes from initial call time) after several people went ahead of us, we sit down. The water glasses are covered in a filmy grime. No one will use them. Two of us worked in restaurants locally so we're not that picky. We get coffee, no silverware. One of us got it for the table, no spoons. Server was super nice. We ordered and the other server did not follow instructions. After 2 hours and 20 minutes from our initial call time, we finally have food. My omelette is burned and my hash browns (1/8 cup portion size) are also completely blackened and charred. Had to ask for cheese since the first request was clearly ignored. Another order of eggs was also completely burned. Scrambled eggs are hard to mess up but they accomplished it. They never brought Dad's OJ out with his meal. They double charged for a drink. It was an awful experience and we only went because Mom highly recommended it. The hostesses were terrible and way too young to be running the front end of a breakfast spot on Father's Day Morning. They also gave super dirty looks and attitude upon leaving the restaurant when we did not acknowledge their clearly forced and non-genuine goodbye thinking we had completely exited the building. Should waited 30 more seconds, girls. The only thing good about this place was our initial server Kylie. She was so sweet and deserves a better team to work with. I will never eat here again. Those of us that had to work today were late due to the incompetency of the staff. It's totally worth it to make the few extra minutes drive to First Watch. My regret of the day is not going there instead."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the family from breakfast.  The food was incredible. Especially the pancakes. They seem that have everything you could possible think of for the perfect breakfast/brunch. We will return."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly.  The food was fresh and very good.  Portion sizes were hearty.  Would eat here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is ok. I didn't hate it but I won't be back, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Scrambler. I was accompanied by my father, a breakfast enthusiast. We arrived 5 minutes before 10:00am and were seated right away. The restaurant is fairly big and has a great atmosphere. The menu has a LOT of options and thus, it took us awhile to decide. After much deliberation I ordered the lean and green omelette (low cal option) and my dad ordered bottomless pancakes, turkey sausage, and eggs. The food was so awesome. I will definitely visit Scrambler again."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there this morning - ordering a waffle and a side of bacon.  Took 25 minutes for the waffle to come out - I asked one of the workers to bring some butter for the waffle - she left to get butter and returned several minutes later to say \"the server will be right out with your butter.\"  The food was cold at this point and the waffle sent back.    Come on people - it's a waffle.....easy to make and get out... no excuse for the poor attention to service and will go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Fast and delicious 5stars. Definetly head and shoulders above the Marie Scrambler in Canton, MI"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. The food was awful. Couldn't even eat the bacon. Out of 4 of people, none of us finished our meal. Pretty tough to screw up bacon and eggs! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Since 9-out-of-10 Cleveland area Yelp reviews mention gluten, patios or some combination of the two Im going to write this quickly...before i puke..  I came here for breakfast and I was pleasantly suprised!  Had some sort of spinach, mushroom omlette and toast.  Asked for extra gluten and I ate it indoors. Every server/worker we came in contact was very genuinely cheery and outgoing.  Very refreshing.  With this being a chain and being in a strip mall in Suburbia this place really kicks ass.  They also have a coupon for a buy 1-get 1 free in the All Around Town book.  I know that coupons/dicounts are taboo on Yelp but I keep it gangster like that...  If your ever out in Mentor and need breakfast peep this place.  If they served booze it would get bumped up to 5 stars in my book.     \"I was seven before I realized that you could eat breakfast with your pants on.\"  ?

{"text":"The food is decent. Never have had a problem with the service. But I would like to see complimentary coffee and tea. It's probably their biggest profit item. $2.29 for a tea bag and some hot water? What a rip off. I'll bring my own tea bag and ask for the hot water next time."}
{"text":"Visited Sat. 11/21 for the first time around 1pm. Got seated immediately, which was great.   The food was good. I had the Westgate skillet, and my fiancé had the traditional Eggs Benedict. The skillets are a great size, and all around $9. Cooked to perfection, although a little lacking in the spiciness category. The coffee was hot and flavorless.  Will probably not return due to our server. She had the most lackluster personality imaginable. Was never welcomed or greeted. She arrived saying, \"Who gets the coffee?\"  Really? Come on, now. Also waited far too long for the check, and went copious amounts of time without refills."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow but the waitress was very nice. Our food didn't take very long and tasted very good.  Coffee was room temperature, water cups weren't very clean. Prices are fair and parking is accessible. Overall, ok experience."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I have yet to have a bad experience. They have a plethora of standard breakfast items, skillets, etc. If you can't find something to your liking on the menu, breakfast/brunch isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Well what can I say.  It must've been good if I am giving a five star review.  Easter Sunday at 645 am.  Treated like I was family at that early.  That can make anyone feel special.  Ordered the Corned beef hash and eggs with rye toast.  The food came out quick and perfect.  I could go on.  But I think I'll leave you with this final sentence.  You will not be disappointed in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I just tried this place the other day and I was very happy with their breakfast. I can see this place becoming my normal Saturday breakfast place. They were very busy and I've learned that are in fact a chain but it doesn't come across that way. The inside is very clean and it has a nice bright happy feel to it. Service was good and we were in and out in no time at all. I will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Cute place in Strongsville! We showed up on Labor Day at 10am and the place was packed, but we were seated immediately. Nice menu with lots of choices. I got the spicy egg and chorizo wrap. The chorizo was almost undetectable in the wrap but the abundance of spicy jalapenos made up for it! Boy, it was good and spicy! The stuffed french toast was also very good. I had the iced coffee which was just perfect because I usually only have my coffee drinks iced (why don't more places offer this?!) Our waitress was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place to have ANY breakfast!  The omelettes, pancakes or eggs are all fantastic!  This place is always hopping-that's the drawback-sometimes you have a wait and then the service is slow.  Don't bother with the lunch items either-they are not good."}
{"text":"The service was pretty poor all around and the food was sub par.  We put our name on the waiting list but watched others get seated before us.  After a while the hostess indicated that our name was never added to the seating list.  The server brought 3 of the 4 ordered meals out and stated she didn't know what kind of pancakes were ordered.  I'm not sure why she waited until all the meals were brought out to get clarification.  We had to wait to eat our meals, allowing our food to get cold, while the 4th meal was being made. I finally took a bite of my, now cold, meal to find it was burnt and dried out.  Looks like they took an old waffle and reheated it up. Overall an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Walked in and originally got placed directly in the sun when asked to move we got sat in the sun again because of server area. Eventually was seated at a table that was enjoyable to eat at. Ordered a skillet, it came out quick but for some reason food was cold. Seemed pre made. Service was mediocre and not friendly other than the hostess. Food over all was alright, need to put customer first."}
{"text":"The restaurant specializes in breakfast and lunch; however, they were out of pancakes today due to someone over salted the batter.  I ordered hot water with lemon and honey to drink.  My lemon wedges were brought to me on the top od a plastic soda lid.  I guess they were out of small plates.  It took 30 minutes to get my food (spinach and bacon omelete) and when I received it the omelet it was missing tomatoes.  I didn't change the way it comes on the menu, it simply wasn't made per the menu description.  The food was decent and the portions are large.  Good luck with anything else."}
{"text":"Tough to provide more stars. Quality of food has consistently gone downhill. Tried this location several times in last 6 months. Many other breakfast places close by that are far better for the same price.   They are busy, orders accurate, friendly waiter and staff, hot food, clean dining area, decent service at times with extensive menu choices, although the food is just \"OK\" at best. Blueberry muffins have no blueberries inside, potatoes bland, omelettes flat.  It is a shame as the location is great.  ."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place. Only been here once with family, but was completely unsatisfied with my meal. Others at the table also said it wasn't as good as their prior visits. They have decent coffee, with flavored creamer if thats your thing. They have ample seating, quick service, and nice employees. It's just their food that is not very good."}
{"text":"So far we have our drinks, the coffee is very weak and undrinkable, the juice and soda is very good and I love that they bring a carafe to each table for water.  I ordered the South of the Border Omelette, which was tasty and a bit spicy, which I like. The hash browns were ok, but the potato squares are amazing!! The service was neutral and I had to ask for refills."}
{"text":"I was super thrilled when Scrambler's opened up, as North Olmsted does not have many choices when it comes to a full-on breakfast.  After being a frequent customer here since their opening, I have to say that this joint is 'hit or miss' in terms of the quality of service and the food.  I've had some great visits here, where the culinary stars aligned and I walked out super happy, and some visits where I left scratching my head in dissapointment, followed by several uncomfortable visits to the 'porcelain god' an hour or two following my meal!  Today, my omelette was way overcooked, greasy, and tasted disgusting (do they use real eggs, or a poured egg mixture?), but last week it was perfect.  I'm thinking I should just go sit on the john now, so I don't have to rush (and risk an 'accident') when that special feeling strikes soon.  It also took us a long time to be acknowledged and to get our drinks, and to get our check.  If and when Scrambler Marie's can achieve a level of consistency for better service and better food, that will be great.  Until then, I will have to visit less often."}
{"text":"Hey Marie, we were pleased with breakfast. Met a friend here while passing through on family vacation. Wow has Strongsville changed in the last 10-15 years!!   We thought the staff was attentive and helpful. Ryan was bussing tables and took time to say \"have a nice day\" as we left. Marie's has a large menu!! Plenty of choices. Pancakes were good, and everyone who had an egg dish enjoyed it. Potatoes were bland, on the dry side. Probably frozen and heated up. I would definitely stop here again.   I think the only negative would be the unwelcome fruit flies at the table. I don't know what it is, but the flies always descend on us. Too sweet maybe?"}
{"text":"I went to breakfast with my mom and brother yesterday and when they picked me up, they suggested going to Scrambler Marie's. I admit I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but I figured you have to try pretty hard to mess up breakfast, so we went.        When we arrived around 8am on a Monday, we were the only ones in there. We were greeted right away and our server was very friendly. He immediately offered coffee and other drinks and came back with them promptly. I wouldn't say the coffee is anything special, but it did the job.        This would definitely be a great place to go if you're really hungry or really like pancakes and French toast. If you order a full order, they're bottomless. This is what my brother ordered. He ate one plate of stuffed French toast (blueberry was the flavor of the day) and then he got a plate to take home. I tried a bite and was surprised at how delicious it was. I usually think stuffed French toast is too sweet, but I enjoyed what I tried.       My mom ordered a veggie omelet with potatoes and a blueberry muffin. I tried the muffin, which my mom really liked but I thought was eh. I ordered a skillet called the \"manhandler\" which was potatoes with sausage and bacon and cheese with two eggs of any style on top (I went with over medium). It also came with 2 slices of toast (4 halves) which was a lot.       The prices were pretty reasonable. Everything looks to be between 8-9$ and they definitely give you a lot of food. Everything I tried was good, but as I said before, it's really hard to mess up breakfast. The restaurant was clean and the people were helpful, but definitely not overly friendly. The lady at the hostess stand didn't even say bye as we walked past, which I always find rude.       I would go back here if I was in the area and someone suggested it, but I probably wouldn't suggest it or go on my own. Very average breakfast place. I've had better and I've had worse."}
{"text":"Wait time a bit long! Expected with new places!   Server was slow to start! Had to get our own cream for the coffee.   Good was slow to come out!  Positive comment, the food was fantastic! Priced fair for portion sizes.   We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the food is above average and the service has always been good for me. The two marks they get taken off for are the costs of the items, which are pretty high for basic breakfast food and the actual meat products. Both the bacon and sausage are below average and very greasy. The one thing that they have on the menu that I keep going back for is the Crab Cake Benny. MMMMM! My kids also like the happy face pancake and I can vouch, saying the pancakes are legit. I will be back, but it isn't in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Very clean, comfortable surroundings. A good menu with many options. A bit pricey, but the food was good and portion sizes were generous. Staff was attentive. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. My boyfriend and I thought we would enjoy a nice breakfast on our day off, but it didn't start out very well. I wish I knew the name of the short blond girl that was greeting but unfortunately I do not. Needless to say, she was incredibly rude. I am a very polite person so I held my tongue but let's just say she should be removed from any hostess duties and put in the back...maybe wash dishes or take out the trash. She led the two of us, with two menus and two sets of silverware, to our table and proceeded to ask my boyfriend what she could get him to drink...and then began to walk away. Are you kidding me???? And when she realized she had forgotten one of the TWO people she turned back with no apology and an attitude like it was an inconvenience that I was there. Not impressed with her attitude. A hostess should smile and be polite...she did not and was not. And to ice her cake...if you're going to be the person everyone sees when they enter the restaurant, take a little pride in how you look. Ugh.  Anyway, the food was mediocre and could easily be made just as well, if not better, in your own kitchen. The sausage gravy was not impressive and my over easy eggs were not very well made and quite a bit runny. It's a good thing they give you a carafe of water because the glasses are tiny!!! The only reason that this review is getting 3 stars is because of our waitress, Adrianna. She was very nice and polite. Perhaps management should ask her to give some lessons to the short, sloppy, rude blond girl that was \"pretending\" to hostess today."}
{"text":"It's been open a little over a week and I've gone 3 times! Tried different things every time and super impressed with it all. The portions are huge so it's nice you can order smaller sizes if you need to. Everything tastes very fresh and much healthier than your typical breakfast joint. So glad it's close by, will be frequenting often!"}
{"text":"So far I have only tried the breakfast here. Today was the country scramble- biscuits topped with hashbrowns, eggs, sausage gravy & chives. Delicious. The wait staff is pleasant & I enjoy the brightly colored dishes. Will Definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 12:30 pm during lunch. The restaurant was pretty full, but there was not a wait to be seated. There were four of us.  Our waitress greeted us and got our drinks. It took her about 15 minutes to return to take our orders. We all ordered and it took about 20 minutes to get our food. This is a breakfast place, normally it doesn't take her long for breakfast items at other restaurants.   The food was average to good. Nothing exceptional. The prices were fair averaging $7-$8 per entree. The portions were on the large size. Drinks (pop) were about $2.25 which I find outrageous as a two litre is less than $1.50 at the store.  The service was slow, the food was good but not great, and the prices were average to slightly high. There was nothing about this visit that would compel me to return."}
{"text":"Scrambler's is by far my favorite breakfast place and frequent them (every Saturday and Sunday) in the greater Columbus area. This, however was the worst Scrambler's experience I've ever had.   It is a Thursday morning (I literally just walked out) and there were maybe 5 other tables, but 5 waitresses, and lots of things went wrong:   It took 10+ minutes and asking 4 times to bring flavored coffee creamer.   I ordered an egg white omelet with peppers, feta, and spinach, and the egg whites were running all over the place, and had onions and a piece of sausage in it (which wouldn't matter except that I'm a vegetarian).   My fruit cup had 1 piece pineapple, cantaloupe, and melon in it and was a very sorry excuse for a fruit side.   The waitresses were standing around the tables off to the side gossiping loudly and obnoxiously.   Very poor service, poor food quality, I would rather go to Waffle House...woof."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Much better fresh ingredients than our other breakfast go to's like Perkins or Bob Evans. And we were able to enjoy the nice weather on their patio! Prices were compatible too : )"}
{"text":"Cool little spot from the norm in the area. Fresh bright colors, good music (all accoustics today). Service is fast and friendly food is good and just the right portion. Lot of healthy selections as well, several quinoa choices if that's your thing too."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time. Ambiance and decor is much better than the one we normally go to in North Olmsted.  They were prompt to the table with water and coffee. And took our order quickly. I got the all American - 3 eggs, 2 massive sausage links, potato chunks and 2 large pancakes. My husband ordered some special with biscuits, gravy, eggs and hash browns all piled on top of one another.  Both were really good and reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Food is always good , the only thing is that the service can be bad sometimes. When I say bad, I mean by waitress being rude, like they didn't want to come to work that day and put all their anger on you for coming in or they just want to rush you to order when u just got the menu. Other then that, I come to a restaurant to eat so I'll give them a 4 star, since the food is always good, and there are more good service than bad service that I have experienced here ."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service. 2 stars for the breakfast. The food wasn't that good. Willing to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Not even mediocre!! Seats dirty, we were given a filthy nasty carafe of water....we didn't dare order drinks....should have left but my friend insisted this place was great on Yelp reviews...so reluctantly I stayed. It took nearly 25 mins before our order was taken, and there were only 4 other tables in the whole place with customers!  Thought it couldn't get worse....well it got WORSE!! I Ordered the Lean green omelette, well done hash browns & an English muffin. As you can see, hash browns far from well done, undercooked in fact....I ordered them well done!! The omelette was watery as can be, the bacon in it I requested was underdone, so I had pieces of soft gross fat lol through it that looked almost raw! Where the \"green\" aka spinach was.....it wasn't in this omelette that's for sure!! Only green bout that omelette was the cash we pissed away at this dive!! I Stopped eating it altogether! We won't be back! Pretty sure I became sick from undercooked pork or Slimey eggs!   Who gave them positive reviews?? Employees?? Friends or family of employees??? People with zero tastebuds???? Paid reviewers???? Your guess is as good as mine!!!"}
{"text":"With a party of 13 people just showing up on a Sunday morning after church they were extremely accommodating and got us all seated right near each other very quickly. The service was excellent and the food was great too!! Pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice omelette with friends on a Saturday morning.  Busy place; waited for 15 mins for seat.  Prompt & friendly service.  I'm bringing my husband back to try this place again."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a breakfast date before he had to go to work. We thought about trying this place before so we decided to since we were in the area. The atmosphere was bright and homey, an ideal place to start your morning. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken immediately. I appreciated that we were given a pitcher of water alongside our main drink orders. However, we weren't very impressed with the size of the cups for the waters. They were one step above a shot glass. Prices are about what you'd expect. We both got pancakes, mine having chocolate chips and strawberries. While I prefer to have my strawberries more sauce-like than fresh, I still found them enjoyable.   We both liked our pancakes, but I have two complaints about them. I don't like that they don't come with some sort of side, especially when I'm paying nearly $8 for them and 99 cents per topping. And while they're supposed to be bottomless, the size of the pancakes makes it pointless. If you get the full order (which is required for the bottomless option), you get three pancakes that are almost the size of the plate. Unless you have one heck of an appetite or multiple stomachs, it's nearly impossible to make to a second plate. My boyfriend ordered a side of hash browns with his pancakes. We shared them and I thought they were decent. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely edible. Overall, I'd come back here and try the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Located on mentor avenue in the plaza across from longhorn.  We were here on a busy Sunday morning and seated right away. Restaurant was clean and our server, Chantelle, was the best. Fast, friendly and thoughtful.  Food was very good and the portions are large. Next time we will share a breakfast because we couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Good food.  Affordable, friendly staff.  They give you a carafe of coffee and water which is great.  Parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"It seems pretty laid back. I was seated immediately, but waited almost 10 minutes for coffee and the cute server to take my order. If you're not in a hurry sit and enjoy the  tunes on Sirius. They have a wide variety of choices. I'm going south of the border. My order came quickly. The skin on taters were crisp and the inside fluffy and not greasy. The omelette was nice and spicy and cooked perfectly. Not a scorch mark on it. I'm very pleased. I'll be back. If they only had Buckwheat pancakes though."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast today. Service was fast and friendly. Food was good. If you're looking for a solid \"normal\" egg breakfast, this is a good bet. You're not going to find short rib hash or chicken and waffles, but you've gotta know what you're getting into right? I had a skillet of some kind that was very pleasingly heavy on the meat and cheese, and it's in my nature to generally want for more of those things.  The corned beef hash was good, the same style as Yours Truly, if that means anything to you (i like it, get it well done!). My girlfriends omelet was pretty solid as well by her report, though I didn't try it.  All in all a pleasant first time in a city that didn't even know breakfast exists until now."}
{"text":"First time at this place today based on Yelp rating. We were not at all disappointed. The food was fantastic and the potions are large.   The service was very good and the best part is they are very affordable. It's always a good day when my wife and I can eat, have great breakfast, be full and all for less than $30 with tip (20%).  The atmosphere is friendly the restaurant is clean and the menu is easy to read and pleasant to look at. We look forward to going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant with my fiancé almost every weekend. They have a wide selection of breakfast and lunch foods that are all very appetizing. They're usually very busy but you don't wait very long. The staff is extremely friendly - every server is courteous, fast, and attentive. It's a clean and very nice looking place. We've never had a bad experience at Scrambler Marie's. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"Saturday Morning 9:45am. Surprisingly there was only a short wait. Not a bad start. We got seated and our drink order was taken immediately.  Our servers name was Hannah. High Schooler who seemed to actually like her job. Very personable.  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy (because I'm a fat ass) and opted for the \"potato chunks\" as my side. Hanna our waitress talked me into \"loading them up with cheese, bacon and sour cream\" DONE. Food was amazing. Nothing left but an empty plate and half of a napkin.  Not a bad place for a corporate joint. Good service and hot food. I will be back"}
{"text":"I'm literally writing this review as I sit here waiting for the waitress to come by and take our order. It's beer over 20 minutes..... We have our drinks but no sign of the waitress. Lots of people standing around.... Not too busy in here for a Saturday morning. A customer ordered a to-go as we sat at our table and his food already bagged and ready! This is literally amusing. Hopefully the food will be good..... If we get to order."}
{"text":"Very average breakfast food. Everything came out quickly, but for a place that's based around breakfast I would expect a little more. I had 3 eggs, bacon, hash browns and wheat toast. I ordered the eggs over medium and they were slightly runny. Bacon ordered crispy and it was slightly chewy. Hash browns were cooked ok a tad under seasoned and then there was the bread, Jesus Christ it was the size of a phone book. Coffee was normal weak crappy diner style coffee. If you've ever been to a place where you walked away thinking \"I could easily make this at home\" this would be the place for that...Our server was very nice and attentive on the upside."}
{"text":"Our worst breakfast experience. Water that tasted like dead fish. Toast burnt on one side and not toasted on the other. Fruit that appeared to be sitting out for 24 hours or longer (which we didn't eat), and both of us sick for the next two days. Horrible dining room too. They seated us at a crappy table in a back room. Never again."}
{"text":"Went for first time on Monday at 1:00. Great service, waitress very friendly. Had eggs Benedict with chunky potatoes, the hollandaise was not hot,barely warm. Did not know there were smaller portions available, would have been enough. The potatoes were very good, also the hollandaise,didn't taste like any hollandaise I ever had before, tasted ok but not the same. Will go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good. I wasn't given a refill on water. My quinoa bowl was watery and had a hair at the bottom. Yuck."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I didn't eat there (not because I didn't try)  I arrived at 9:10 on a Thursday morning, 10/23/14. They were not crowded at all. I waited a minute or so at the hostess stand, I saw 2 people carrying a bunch of plates to a table. As soon as they delivered the plates one of them came over, said good morning, asked me how many people (1) and sat me, gave me a menu and asked if I would like coffee.  I said I would like coffee and a large ice water. She came right back with water and then I never saw anyone again visit my table.  I DID see 4 workers standing around and talking over by the kitchen...but nobody came near me.  After 10 minutes, around 9:23, I decided it was not worth it and left to never return.  So my rating was based on the service and not the food...I would have loved to try some of their French toast, but was never given the chance."}
{"text":"Great Service Good Food if you are looking for something different I suggest here. If you go away hungry it's your own fault."}
{"text":"Tried the Strongsville and North Olmsted locations of this restaurant. The food was delivered to our table COLD at both establishments. Food timing of meals to our table was off and coffee was not that hot. Prices are on the higher end. Was told our was most likely cold because they do not use heat lamps....so it must sit there for awhile if the wiatress is busy.  Will not ever return or recommend."}
{"text":"Good breakfasts! Though the skillet breakfast is better on paper than on the plate (well, skillet). It wasn't as cheesy melty as I expected it to be. So next time I'll get one of the breakfast plates, cause those looked real good coming out. Also, I was impressed that in the mini jams stand on the table they had apple butter - not something you see everywhere (Ok, so I notice the small things!). It's not greasy, like a lot of breakfast joints are, and has a real big selection on the menu, which in this case isn't a bad thing."}
{"text":"I really like this place but something has changed in the last 6 months food is alway being brought out cold. My bacon was cold again today (which I can kinda understand, a side of bacon cools down fast) but my hash browns were cold as well! And I even flipped them over and the bottom was even colder, makes me wonder how long they were sitting back there waiting for someone to order them. ?"}
{"text":"Great place for a simple breakfast. They have a nice menu, selections can suit every taste. The staff is friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is attached to the neighborhood I live in.  So we eat here all the time.  Located in a busy strip I saw others going into the Salon and Yoga place this morning while looking for parking.  At peak morning times it can be a challenge to find a parking spot.  The inside is laid out well.  Light pastel colors on the walls with decor.  Bright colored plates on tables.  It's warm and welcoming.  This morning I ordered the Westgate skillet.  The description reads \"Spicy chorizo sausage, jalapenos, green chiles, onions, homemade salsa and a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.\"  Anything that has cheese in it here comes loaded with cheese.  I swear I ordered this once and it easily had a pound of cheese on it.  No joke.  So I ordered it with light cheese.  That was perfect.  The chorizo has the consistency of Taco Bell ground beef.  The jalapeño, green chiles and onions with salsa taste like it came out of a can.  I ordered 2 over medium eggs that come on top.  Underneath the chorizo mixture are home cooked potatoes.  Those taste like the frozen bag variety.    Water and coffee are served in a pitcher and carafe.  Service is quick and friendly.  Everything arrived promptly and hot.  No issues there.  Overall this place is just OK.   The food quality lacks what I've experienced at other top notch breakfast establishments.  Only reason we keep going here is because it's so close to home.  I have literally walked here before.  Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way."}
{"text":"The crab cake smelled so bad.  Eggs weren't cooked all the way.  Service was horrible."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant was SO hot inside. I'm a cold person and I was literally sweating throughout my whole meal. We told the waitress and she said they turned it down but it was still so uncomfortable. Our food took at least a half hour to come out. Once it did my order was wrong and the food was cold. They also ran out of chicken for my mom's salad and forgot to bring out the bread that was included with it. Her salad also was not fresh. The waitress was really nice and apologetic but it was overall a bad experience. Not worth it for mediocre food and a bad atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my recent experience at this establishment.  The place was packed on Sunday morning, however we were promptly seated after only a 5 minute wait.  I didn't mind waiting because they have a self-serve coffee station in the lobby.  It's the little details such as this that will have me coming back in the future.  Our server was outstanding.  You could tell that she was a little overwhelmed by the large parties being seated in her section, but she always checked on us and was super friendly.    We ordered the eggs benedict and the banana crunch pancakes. As we waited, a carafe of lemon water and a pot of coffee were delivered to the table.  How awesome is that!?  There's nothing better than the ability to refill your own coffee.   You know that feeling when you get your coffee to the perfect cream-to sugar-to-temperature ratio and the waitress blindsides you with a top-off?  Gets me every time!    As we pleasantly waited for our meals to arrive, I hear someone ringing a bell.  My first thought is that they participate in that annoying \"happy birthday\" jingle.  However the bell, and our food, was approaching our table.  My first inclination is that my dining companion is playing a horrible joke on me.  This is not the case.  We actually earned a free meal because it is being served on a blue plate!  I love it!!!    I think we've just found our new \"go-to\" breakfast establishment.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience.  (Oh, and the food is really good!)"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for the first time today. It was more then a half hour before they closed and a girl came to seat us and the first words out of her mouth were \"we close at 3\" we said ok and a second girl came chasing her down the hall saying we are closed! You can't seat them! They seemed annoyed that were interested in eating there, so they don't have to worry we won't bother them again."}
{"text":"Kind of crazy during prime time Sunday breakfast. I ordered the Mini Classic thinking I would get small pancakes...they were huge!  I'm not complaining. But just an FYI. The coffee was not great tasting #bitter. But very nice to have your own carafe. I would go back, but try for off hours."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been here several times with my husband and we've never technically had a problem. The food is always out fairly quickly, we've never had to wait very long, and the servers have always been friendly. On top of all that, our food has honestly always been good.   So why the 3 stars? Well, I hate to say it, but this place feels extremely dirty. The water comes out in a carafe with lemons already in it. The carafe looks incredibly dingy, the lemons inside are always gross looking, and the cups stink. My husband and I always drink water when we go out to eat, so going to a place with nasty cups and water is a huge turn off. Next, the women's restroom is at the entrance to the kitchen. The kitchen entrance is open and you can see inside. I honestly wish I hadn't looked. It looked totally rank in there. The food, floor, counters, and employees just looked absolutely foul. It made my stomach turn.   After our meal and once we were home I looked at the reviews and pictures of some other customer's gross food and that just did me in. Like I said, our food was fine. Actually, it tasted good! But the nasty water and cups + the dirty kitchen + the Yelp pictures of moldy toast just really ruined it for me. I'm from Columbus and the Scramblers there are pretty well maintained, but sadly, I can't recommend this North Olmsted location."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of options for the lean and herbivore eaters. Bottomless pancakes are huge lol"}
{"text":"This is a very average breakfast place.  The food is OK, the coffee is OK. The prices are a bit high, I think, for what they offer. The service was really good. The nice thing about this place is that they do offer turkey sausage for breakfast for people who don't eat pork. That is a huge plus for me. Overall, there are a lot of options for breakfast on the weekends so this might not be my first choice, however, it wasn't bad and the location is convenient if you are getting ready for a day of shopping."}
{"text":"I love going to Scrambler's (aka Scrambler Marie's) with my family. It's a ste-up from most of the breakfast chains out there, and while not as cheap as a Denny's or iHop, it also is affordable.   The griddle items are bottomless, which suits my addiction to French Toast.   The breakfast potato chunks are heavenly, and I love how they bring a carafe of lemon water and your own coffee pot to your table.   Portions are generous and the service is always pleasant, regardless of which location I dine at  There's a reason that this place is always busy, despite the fact that they are only known for breakfast and lunch.   Give them a shot!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars, but don't think I can.   Eight of us met here for breakfast this morning. I was a bit surprised that it wasn't that busy at 9AM on a Sunday so we were seated right away.   Four of the eight of us ordered the mini classic which included two eggs. Each of us ordered our eggs differently. When we were served, they could not seem to get the orders right and had to send two back.   One in our party had to wait for the proper entree but was given the side of pancakes.   The food was really decent once everything was corrected and server was pleasant, but there are enough good breakfast places in the area so why would I come back here."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast, nothing fancy.  Bacon was cold, hash browns cold, eggs steaming.  I ordered the grilled chicken salad with corn and salsa.  Somewhat bland, but simple and fresh."}
