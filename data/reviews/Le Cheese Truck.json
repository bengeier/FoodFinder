{"text":"Yum!! Shared the Mac n cheese and loved it. I think the portion size was a tad small but it was very delicious and I recommend it :) PS - like them on FB for some special treats ;)"}
{"text":"Honeslty the TOTS are to die for!!!
We also had the classic wich was whatever it was a bit dry and wasnt cheesy at all.
The grilled cheese poutine was good. And tge reuben was so delish!!they make there own french sauce thumbs up!I love this place im so happy they opened an actual store! The food truck is wicked cool but its nice to know they have a location!"}
{"text":"I ate at Le Cheese Truck twice over the weekend while at Osheaga and it was excellent. They have awesome offerings including cheesy tater tots and deep fried cheesecake, but I opted for the sandwich of the day on each of my visits. 
The first was a combo of mozzarella, chorizo sausage and pesto. The second was mozzarella, roasted chicken, bacon and Dijon. Both were insanely good. My mouth is watering while I type. 
The guys running the truck really know what they're doing. They're polite, clean, and have really reasonable wait times. Best of all - they're not stingy when it comes to the cheese.
If you find yourself wandering and are lucky enough to run into Le Cheese Truck, you're in for a treat! :)"}
{"text":"Had the 1/4lb mac & cheese. The cheese was gooey  with specks of burnt cheese which made part of the mac crunchy. They added green peas and I think a bit of bread crumbs. Although I feel like 6$ is a bit much for what you get I was very happy with the taste."}
{"text":"Last summer I made the wonderful discovery that everyday a different food truck would be at Dorchester Square, right in front of my work. Queue me going maybe a bit too often to try out all the different food trucks. I'd say I tried every single one once, so a good 20 different food trucks. Now I may be biased because I love cheese, but who doesn't? This was hands down the best food truck out of them all. They have fried cheesecake, gooey grilled cheese, the most delicious mac and cheese I've ever had and so much more. I love this food truck so much that I have traveled on my own time to go get some of their delicious food because I couldn't wait til they'd reappear at my work. If you ever see this truck, don't hesitate. There's usually a long line but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Let's face it; childhood, or our idea of it is one of the snuggliest places you can sneak back to. This diner makes that visit not only easy but also rewardingly filling. Their classic grilled cheese sandwich has bacon in just the right proportion and is as flat and squishy as your memory of Mom's lunches. The Reuben sandwich had white cheese, pastrami, sauerkraut and a hint of hot mustard.  I wish now that my Mom would have developed that recipe because it really is that good. The tater tots are amazing; crunchy on the outside and dreamily soft and cheesy on the inside.

Enough reading about the place, go there now!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars: Discovered this food truck as we were wandering around Dorchester Square (they rotate their location daily according to guy taking our order).

Out of the 3 trucks parked in the area, this one had a huge line of people swarming so naturally that attracted us to it, to discover that everyone was jumping all over this for their grilled cheese. 

Classic Grilled Cheese - You can't mess up a grilled cheese, and these guys did not. I was just hoping that it had some special cheese/bread/element to it, but overall it's just a straightforward grilled cheese.

The tater tots seem to be something special here that everyone wants to get their hands on. Unfortunately they just ran out at around the 1:00pm when we stepped up to order. I'll be left wondering what was so good since everyone had a look of despair once they realized there was none left.

FRIED CHEESECAKE - Probably the savior of our meal. Battered and topped with a strawberry jam based sauce. 

They also offer Mac and Cheese too sold by the pound in small/med/large takeout style containers."}
{"text":"Just came from the Taste of Monkland street festival.  I heard Lori Graham on CTV last night, saying that there was a Mac&Cheese with bacon poutine waiting for her.  It stuck in my head all through the night!  So I couldn't wait to see if I could find this delicacy!  I got to Monkland just after noon, had to wait for Le Cheese truck to open, but I was #5 to order my lunch!  The menu said nothing about poutine(which is probably just as well), so I had the Mac&Cheese with bacon!!!  Not a word of complaint!!  I am now on a mission to find a comparable recipe so I can create the dish at home.  Then I was informed that they have a resto on Monkland!  We actually passed it on the way home.  Never mind the recipes, I've found bliss on Monkland!!!"}
{"text":"We we're walking along lazily the Annual Monkland Village Street Fair. A motley of food vendors with prevalence of equal denomination, both food trucks and stalls we're available. We had the 'Classique' grilled cheese. I love paper thin pressed sandwiches. Just enough cheese and butter to summarize a great meal."}
{"text":"First ever food truck! After a couple of years hearing about this concept I finally tried one! And this is where my exclamation points end...

First, hard to get the guy on the phone to pin point where exactly the truck was. On Victoria at the corner of President Kennedy,  south of Sherbrooke.
What he told me: rue du musee near Sherbrooke. ..

Secondly, slacker at the front of the truck mumbles and low talks, overcharge me; not impressed.

Thirdly, tried their watery tasteless lemonade,  their cheeseless mushy 9$ cheese steak sandwich (nothing like a Phily cheese steak...)

Very pricey, hard to find, uninspired food truck left me starving.

But at least a Phily Cheese Steak restaurant is opening in october on St-Viateur.  Hope they get it right."}
{"text":"J'ai eu la chance de goûter aux produits du Cheese Truck lors de la soirée de lancement qui a eu lieu au Lili & Oli. En gros, on aime le concept original qui est de produire un menu varié à base de fromage, par contre les produits que j'ai goûtés ne m'ont pas jeté à terre. Les tater tots sont en fait des boulettes de fromage frites assez ordinaires, le Mac and cheese était bien mais sans effet de \"WOW\" et le grilled cheese classique était correct, le mot classique étant bien désigné puisque well, j'ai pas nécessairement eu de coup de foudre. Peut-être que c'est parce que je suis restée dans les \"classiques\" justement, mais je m'attendais quand même à des saveurs moins prévisibles. C'était que le menu disponible au lancement, mais je sais que leur menu est plus varié habituellement, alors si je recroise le camion je vais sûrement leur donner une deuxième chance. En plus, il me reste toujours à goûter leur cheesecake frit, qui n'était pas disponible au lancement; j'ose espérer que c'est ce qui va finalement me charmer!"}
{"text":"If you a Mac and Cheese lover then you'll love it here. A little out of the way from the Center of monkland but worth the extra few blocks down. 
While we were sitting down and enjoying grilled cheese sandwich which I found not too greasy and a good portion. There was a take out order happening for a party. Great idea! And the Mac and cheese bowls are perfect. Also tried the tater tots.. Wow fantastic.. The potatoes and mashed with just enough cheese, fried to perfection. Don't pop the first one in you mouth! You might not burn yourself and not enjoy the rest :)"}
{"text":"I went there when the truck was parked on de Bluery and St.Catherine for the Just For Laughs Festival. 

I ordered the special of the day which was a roast chicken and bacon grilled cheese and I got a side of tator tots. It took almost 15 mins before the guy at the window came to tell me there was something wrong with their fryer and was unable to make the tator tots. I substituted with the gazpacho which really was okay. 

You`d imagine that there would be better communication with the staff for such a small truck, I would have thought the guy that took my order knew there was an issue with the fryer. Maybe not. I waited more than 20 mins for my order. That`s a bit much for a grilled cheese and cold soup. It wasn`t busy, at the time it was only myself and a friend who had ordered. 

I found they were extremely over priced for what serve. I think it was like $11. We`re talking grilled cheese. It was actually pretty good, my mother makes it better. 

I did reach out to them on Twitter to see what time they closed at and they responded within mins. I`ll give them that! I wouldn`t go back but I hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"If you like cheese, there's no doubt you will LOVE this truck. Had their mac n' cheese which was nostalgic and delicious then had some tater tots \"le Cheese\" style (could have easily eaten 50 of them, they were great) and my girlfriend got some deep fried cheesecake, which again, dangerous for the belly but so damn good. Overall, if you're looking for a quick and delicious lunch from some cool guys, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Le Cheese - a truck all about cheese and the different ways one can enjoy cheese. On my first visit, saddened by the Fried Cheesecake being sold out (more on that later...), I went for their special of the day - a fried onion, bacon and swiss grilled cheese. A nice size sandwich - the bread had a great grilled crisp exterior and the combo of onions and bacon gave a nice fatty sweetness to the sandwich. The swiss wasn't completely melted to my liking but honestly a minor quibble. Still a great sandwich.

As luck would have it, I got the chance to walk by Le Cheese again a few days later when I went back to a final go-through and they had the fried cheesecake still available. 3 mini pieces of cheesecake deep fried and covered with a strawberry coulis. The cheesecake itself was nice and the strawberry coulis added some sweet fruitiness. The batter really had no flavour to speak of but at least it didn't get in the way of the cake. A solid dessert."}
