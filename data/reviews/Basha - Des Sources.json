{"text":"Usually I go to Amir on Sources Blvd in DDO's Centennial Plaza, but for some reason decided to try Basha's, which is a few doors down in the same plaza. Bad idea. Upon entering, the place has that \"run-down\" feel, and doesn't exactly feel inviting. I placed my order and asked for both garlic and hummus sauce, but when I went to pay the cashier charged me $0.50 per plate for \"extra\" sauce, as I had 2 different sauces on my plate. I said the man who served me didn't tell me that that adding a second sauce was an extra charge, which is surprising since other places give both sauces without charge. They didn't care and charged me for the skimpy half-spoons of sauce. I can afford to pay $0.50 for extra sauce, but I didn't appreciate that they didn't tell me beforehand about this surcharge, and that they still wanted to charge me extra even though I was already buying 5 shish taouk plates! Once we tasted the food, it was not that great either; the potatoes were very oily, plus they don't put much chicken on the plate. They can continue charging for a tiny bit of extra sauce, because it won't matter to me as I won't be returning there. I would much rather go to Amir, which is a few doors down in the same complex. I've gone many times there, and by comparison, the shish taouk plate at Amir is delicious, and the employees are very friendly. Unlike Basha, they don't skimp on the chicken by giving customers more potatoes on their plates, and they don't charge extra for sauce!!!"}
{"text":"5 star dining for a fraction of the price. It is the best Basha in town hands down, same owners for years, quality ingredients and consistent. I go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Tried this place after my fiance raved about it. The food was pretty good. We got some chicken platters and the chicken comes fresh off of a spit and the rice and hummus was amazing. Service was very friendly and the food is all halal. Price was very fair as well. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative reviews I would! Absolutely the worst Basha I have ever been to anywhere!! The food is so disgusting, the chicken tastes awful, the salad was rotten, and when they ask you if you want garlic and hummus, they don't tell you that they will charge you an extra $.50 for chooses both (unlike any other basha that I've been to). They charge you an extra $1 for giving you a pita with your plate, and when I took the basha health plate, rather than coming with 3 salads, it came with two and i had to pay an extra $1 for another. All of this and their prices aren't even cheaper than any of the other Bashas! DON'T GO HERE!! IT'S SO NASTY!"}
{"text":"Best basha I've been to. Amir does not compare. Awesome food and staff is super nice."}
{"text":"C'est quoi un Basha? C'est un Amir mais en mieux organisé. Le traditionnel Pita Shish Taouk (au poulet) Shawarma (au boeuf) et Falafel (Pois chiche fris) avec sauce à l'ail, Hummus, Sauce Tahini (sésame). Navet mariné, piment, oignon mariné, tomate, laitue iceberg. Les vignes farcies, les salades de persils. Bon vous voyez les genre. C'est moins cher que Amir, entre 5 et 15$ le repas. À mon avis, super Pre-Drunk food. (bouffe pour préparé une solide cuite)."}
{"text":"The best meal I've had since I moved back to Montreal. People very friendly, place is very clean, the food is amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants really great Lebanese food. This is now the only place I will visit when I have my cravings. Thank you for making me happy...not an easy thing to do!"}
