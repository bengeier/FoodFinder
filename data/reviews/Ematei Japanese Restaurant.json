{"text":"Ematei is very close to my workplace. I don't visit this place as often as I should, but whenever I do I am never disappointed.  Lunch here is always packed, so arrive early! There is always a special going on either a sushi combo, udon noodle or a bento box.   Their chicken katsu curry portion is huge and very tasty. It will set you back $12.50 but it is definitely worth it!  I love the decor!   Simple yet elegant and the staff are efficient and super friendly!   Do yourself a favour by going to this Japanese own and operated Izakaya and taste the different."}
{"text":"Last night we had dinner at Ematei with our nephew and our daughter who recommended it. Based on reviews we had high expectations. The restaurant has a casual, authentic ambiance with lots of people celebrating the holiday season. My husband and nephew had Sukiyaki with a tray of fresh ingredients which they cooked as they ate. Their dinner was ready in about 10 minutes. My daughter had Chirashi  which arrived shortly after from the sushi bar. After more than an hour passed, I asked the waitress about my Salmon Teriyaki, a simple item to prepare. She rushed into the kitchen and informed me it was coming but there were many orders ahead. After 15 minutes more, another waitress told me the Thursday evening Chef was \"slow\" and suggested I order from the sushi bar. My choices had to exclude items that involved the Chef in any way (e.g., soft shell crab for Spider Roll). I chose Makisushi and California Roll. After another 10 minutes, the waitress returned looking stressed since the Chef had made my dinner and would be upset if I cancelled. So, I accepted the dinner. The plate had two slices of Pacific salmon which were overcooked and served with a dollop of uninspired potato salad. The Japanese love mayonnaise but this was not delicious potato salad. To compensate for the Chef's fiasco in the kitchen the waitress brought us a special dessert - oranges! My daughter commented that this was the standard fruit served at the end of Ematei meals. I cannot recommend Ematei, unless you are prepared to wait endlessly and do not mind accommodating an unhappy Chef, frightened waitresses and unconcerned management! Apparently, the other chef is fine. Be warned!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and suboptimal quality of food."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my coworkers as they said it was a good spot for some Asian cuisine. We sat down and were greeted with tea immediately. Everyone (the 5 of us) placed orders fairly quickly and received our complimentary salads and soups shortly after that. As we were eating our soups, my Manager and I were chatting and he looked down into his bowl to see something terrifying! There was a German cockroach floating at the top of his miso soup. We lost our appetites immediately and proceed to leave. It was horrible! We work close by, but unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"3 things I usually get at this place: Steamed Egg Custard, hotpot and BBQ duck roll with spinach. Price is a bit high. Staff are friendly but sometimes can be hard to get their attention. For some reason I like the dimly lit atmosphere, makes you feel relaxed without a lounge feel."}
{"text":"It's rare that a restaurant actually reminds me of the country from which the cuisine comes, but Ematei actually reminds me of Japan.  Hidden off of Queen West, it took me months before I finally stumbled in, but when I did I was greeted by a warm but dark and worn 1970s mock-shoji interior that feels like a number of the unpretentious restaurants I came across in Japan.  Decent service combined with very Japanese Japanese food--the nigiri is large slices of tender and fresh fish and wonderfully presented--make it a find.  It's not the best sushi in Toronto, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're nearby and have a hankering."}
{"text":"I will be so sad if this place goes out of business I have been coming here since I was a child and nothing has changed not the food or charming comforting atmosphere (even the wait staff? she still asks me how school is) It is never anything cool or new but always solid, dependable great authentic Japanese.it doesn't pretended to be a gourmet sushi place or a modern take on the Isakaya it is a traditional Isakaya. Every time I go I see Japanese tourists which I take as marker of authenticity. The sushi here is not the best but fine.....if you are craving straight sushi go elsewhere but their cooked food although nothing modern or innovative is completely on point and always hits the spot. I have never had a bad meal here and ordered almost everything. The kinpira is possibly my favourite. Also If you ask they will make you a large green salad with avocado."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for over a decade, I'm kind of picky about Japanese restaurants.  Ematei is the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Great food, friendly service and nice casual atmosphere.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants really authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. They have cute little plastic replicas of the sushi or lunch specials they have for that day at the front of the restaurant. Reasonably priced at $8-12 for a lunch set with miso soup and salad. Their standard hot green tea was delish. Tasted like matcha powder. Overall food was mediocre and some of their staff honestly had horrible service. Looked annoyed when we asked to order or get a refill of tea. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY AT LUNCH! If you want to stand at the front doors and not be spoken to for 10 minutes and when walk into the restaurant to ask about wait time and be barked at by the full-of-attitdue chef then feel free. We used to go a lot and didn't feel this kind of attitude but after three recent trips and the aforementioned experience - we will never go back."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to Ematei?!!?? This used to be THE preeminent authentic Japanese restaurant of Toronto. The sushi was not fresh, kitchen food average at best. 1 star!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here regularly for almost a decade.  It is a hidden gem.  Truly authentic Japanese and always delicious.  The prices are very reasonable for the high caliber of the dishes available.    I highly recommend the Katsu Curry.  I think it is sadly overlooked by most folks looking for more standard Japanese fare.     I think the restaurant itself could do with a light makeover, as it's beginning to show it's age, but it just goes to show that it has proven its cuisine has stood the test of time."}
{"text":"Has a restaurant ever sworn at you for complaining? Read on.    I really wish that I can give negative stars to this establishment. It is horrendous customer service and food! The owner or manager, this middle/old aged guy with white hair, was completely rude! We ordered California roll.We didn't like it and we wanted to return it or ask them to make us another one. When we talked to the waitress, she was very rude and actually laughed at us and then we asked for the manager. The manager came and he got really mad that we said we didn't like the California roll. It tasted really bad. I have had a lot of sushi in my life and the quality of that was really bad and I'm not even a picky eater. Something was really off about the California rolls. We said it was too salty, he said in a very rude tone \"this is not salty\" . And we said that we usually don't have fish eggs on it because most places don't make it with fish eggs. He said that it comes with fish eggs and that it is clearly stated on the menu. We said nope, it was never listed on the menu. Then he grabbed the menu violently and tried to look for the ingredients listed and then realized no ingredients were listed, only the name, and guess how he responded??? He said \"well you should have known!\" I'm like...do we look psychic to you??? We were not even rude to him and he caused a big huge scene in front of everyone. He said we are rude for saying that the food sucks. Hello we are customers! If we don't like something and is dissatisfied, I think we have the right to state our minds. He said that to eat our other foods, pay, leave and never come back. He also wanted us to pay without eating and never come back which is unfair. And then he slammed the menus on our table. We got so angry, we didn't eat any of the other foods we ordered because he angered us so much and we walked out the door after he totally embarrassed us and embarrassed himself. He said \"if everyone complains, how do I make money!\" He was so rude, didn't care about customer service, and only cared about making money. Very selfish indeed and very greedy. He had no customer service skills whatsoever. He needs to be fired or something. And this place needs to make better California rolls before charging someone $7 for disgusting tasting california rolls. He then said to my boyfriend to never come back and that he better not see his f*cken face again. I am serious, that's the tone he talked to us in and those exact words. And the whole time, we didn't even yell or scream. We remained calm. We were just trying to state our thinking and just because we complained, he didn't like it. He did not offer a replacement or anything. He just wanted us to pay no matter what. This owner is so greedy. Never coming back again. I'll rather spend my money on someone who cares about customer service rather than yell at them in front of everyone and is so money hungry. Rude guy, you will never have my business again. And I will make sure my friends won't go there either."}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on here but each time I go back the food seems to get worse.   - The short rib yakitori was stringy and tough; like chewing on old shoe leather. - The chicken leg yakitori was dry and devoid of flavor; it could have been chicken breast for all I know. - The ankimo (monk fish liver) was OK but not transcendent the way it ought to be.  The butter scallops were still good and I enjoyed the chicken katsu but Ematei is barely getting three stars after my last meal there. I hope things shape up soon!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, Ematei was the only spot in TO where I could find real Japanese people working in a restaurant that didn't specialize in sushi. It was probably the closest thing you could find to an izakaya in TO before the Guu clan came over from Vancouver. Unfortunately, the atmosphere isn't as fun and boisterous as an izakaya, so it's really just a regular Japanese restaurant.  They do have yakitori items on their menu but unfortunately you can't watch them grill the skewers in front of you. The food is authentically Japanese, but the quality of the food isn't as good as their new competition Guu. If you're frustrated by the long lineups and no reservation policy of Guu, give Ematei a try!"}
{"text":"Japanese restaurants are a dime a dozen in Toronto's competitive landscape.  Ematei fails to impress and, believe me, I was really rooting for it to become my new local grubbery."}
{"text":"Lunch special is very good value/quality here.  They usually have 3 lunch specials daily.  Combination($8.50), daily lunch special ($8.50), and daily sushi lunch special ($12.50)  Ordered the combination special today($8.50): Starts off with miso soup and salad.  Then comes the rectangular bento with a bowl of curry, mixed tempura(2 shrimp, 2 broccoli, 1 onion, 1 yam), and 2 pieces of pork katsu.  Also came with a big bowl of rice.    Ingredients are above average quality.  Very full after.  Also comes with green tea!  Very good price-quality ratio for lunch.   Highly recommmended for lunch."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from an actual Japanese run restaurant. I waited 25 min for my food and the restaurant was half empty. The food was ok.. I had better.   I would return to try other dishes and see if maybe it was just an off night the first time."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restaurant I have ever eaten at in Toronto. I have some experience with Japanese food as I travelled there some time ago, and from what I remember this is exactly what authentic Japanese food really is. Try a bit of everything and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here with my husband and some friends. Worst experience ever! Overpriced menu and nothing special."}
{"text":"After trying Chanko in Japan last year, we were craving it here in Toronto. There's not a lot of places that i know of in Toronto that offer this. We decided to check this place out. it's  has a small exterior tucked away off Queen street on St. Patrick St. It's a little dark in here and brings you back to nolstagic Japan.  we ordered a Chanko Nabe ($66.00) plus chicken heart skewers and chicken leg skewer ($2.00 each). The portion was very big and there was only 2 of us. I am fairly certain, it would have sufficient even for a third person. The soup was favourful, service was quick. We arrive around 6. It wasn't busy when we first arrive but filled up quickly. Even so, the speed of service remained unchanged. My only complaint was that the skewers were a little bland."}
{"text":"Average priced food. Cheaper than what most Toronto sushi place would be. Average taste, nothing amazing.  We entered at 7:45 and didn't get out till 10:13pm. Service was shockingly slow.  Problem is, the owner/cashier lady was really rude, angry, and ignored every table. They were short staffed and the staff clearly hated her, witnessing the way they angrily converse. It gives off a vibe where the owner pays these student workers next to nothing and expected the traditional 'work your hardest because that's how it should be' attitude. And she'll keep abusing her power because people are easily fooled by the unique exterior. And it's convenient for the condo/apartment residents in the area as well.   Slow service and food was just okay."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was lacking. Dishes were super slow to make it to the table for a weekday at dinner time. We were seated in a booth ish table. The place has strange decor that is dangerously close to being Chinese restaurant style but without all the personality.  Was the wait worth it?   Mostly. The soup stood out the most. So very delicious! Some of the rolls were alright, some were too small to remember.  Be warned their sushi comes with wasabi (horseradish actually, I think) already rolled up, so don't get surprised by the kick. It's actually kind of nice that way. Well proportioned!"}
{"text":"We brought my cousin who was visiting us from New York to Ema-Tei. The reason why we chose Ema-Tei was because most japanese restaurants offer only little dishes that are hard to share between a large group of people. But Ema-Tei's sukiyaki  serves this purpose perfectly. Also, it encourages interaction between people as you help people to add food into the pan and get what they want. This is what I always look for when dining with a group of friends.  Sukiyaki  :: The beef and a variety of vegetable came on a plate uncooked along with a gas stove and heated pan. Then, the server would place about 1/3 of the food on the heated pan and add the sukiyaki sauce into it. They were ready to serve when the sauce was heated up and the food was cooked. According to your own pace and preferences, you can slowly add the food into the pan afterwards.   It is highly recommend that you would share this dish with at least 3-4 four people even though it is intended for two (according to their menu). JW and I tried eating the sukiyaki once with just us two and we were very very full after that.    Although these were not the best beef, they were still very tender. The vegetable was delicious after absorbing all the flavour in the sauce. Generally, sukiyaki sauce is mix of mirin sauce, soya sauce, sake and plenty of sugar and hence its saltiness and sweetness. It is very tasty however it can be very salty after awhile. Therefore, we had to add diluted sukiyaki sauce to dilute the saltiness (given to us at the beginning). At the same time, we preferred serving the sukiyaki with rice to balance out the strong flavour. Overall, I really enjoyed the sukiyaki. However, it is noted that the sauce didn't taste exactly the same every time we visited Ema-Tei.   We also ordered sushi and grilled mackerel. They were well done and lived up to our expectations.    Verdict:  roasted!   Ema-Tei is one of the traditional japanese restaurants found in Toronto. We  like to visit it every now and then for their sukiyaki and curry! Also, it is not too hard to get a table when you walk in at 7-8pm. Therefore, Ema-Tei will continue to be one of our favourite places for some japanese food other than ramen and sushi.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/06/07/ema-tei-japanese-restaurant/ for pictures of the food i mentioned !"}
{"text":"uh if people come to this place for sushi or sashimi, it is a total miss at the point of the restaurant. Honestly, if one was going to make a special trip to this restaurant,  i would only come here for the sukiyaki, chanko nabe or the seafood one that you have to order a day in advance, those are their specialty. They are very delicious and truly gives a touch of home-like japanese comfort food and are rarely offered in downtown area. The rest of the stuff are only average, might as well hit another joint for.   yelp reviews really need to be a bit more insightful."}
{"text":"Really interesting selection of food. Had the pork katsu curry, chicken karaage, and miso soup on my first visit. Then I got the chawanmushi and chicken katsudon on my second. Lastly, I had the black sesame ice cream. Everything tasted really great and authentic! No complaints here. The atmosphere was nice and quiet too. Will definitely come back to try other things. :)"}
{"text":"Overall this place is fantastic!  Authentic Japanese food.  I particularly like their Tendon.  Price in general is a bit high.  But that's to be expected in downtown."}
{"text":"I had a tempra don. it was really nice and good portion. and not expensive!  I really recommend the restaurant! and taste like a real Japanese food!! I could enjoy dinner there!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Hands down my fav Japanese restaurant, the beef teriyaki was deeeelicious!! You want authentic this is the place! Excellent value! Am def returning!"}
{"text":"Ematei is a fun place in a quiet corner of the street that has apparently existed for over a decade. We came here with another couple, at their suggestion. I didn't know this place even existed and probably never would have had they not told me about it. There are plenty of tables, including a party room behind blinds where you sit on the floor and a big square party table in corner, too.  We ordered lots of food and drinks:  BBQ duck - crunchy skin, juicy meat, awesome Hotate scallops - delicious Black Cod with miso - classic and very tasty Spicy salmon & tuna rolls - I'm not a fan of any spicy mayo rolls but everyone else seemed to think they were good Gyoza - crispy outside, fresh and steaming on the inside Tempura veggies - very well fried - not greasy King mushrooms - excellent Shitake mushrooms - even better than the King Spinach with bonito - gotta put some greens in ya BBQ spare ribs - tender and moist  This is great Japanese restaurant with very good value for the money. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We were there late evening on a weekday so possibly not optimal but it didn't quite live up to other people's reviews. Some sushi better than others, salmon nigiri was best of those we tried. Staff very friendly though!"}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Japanese restaurants in Toronto. They have a great selection with the top selection being their hot pot. I would personally recommend this place to anyone who wants to have good cooked Japanese food. They do have some sushi/sashimi, their sushi/sashimi is nothing special. But it has so many great cooked dishes. It has tons of small dishes that you can order so great for drinking."}
{"text":"I took my parents out for dinner this week. We have been coming to this restaurant over the few years, but never wrote a review. So finally, here it is. Ematei is better than average Japanese restaurant. They do have good sushi and an assortment of cooked food. Honestly, it tastes like comfort food if you grew up eating things like udon and hotpot. I ordered the Bento Box. There was a variety of fish cooked in a broth, fried shrimp ball stuffed in a mushroom, 4 types of sushi, and lots more. It was too much food for me. A bit salty, but the seasoning was there. Another nice touch about this restaurant is they they actually have real Japanese people working at a Japanese restaurant. It makes the experience a bit more authentic. I just wished that they would change up their menu a bit so I can try some different items."}
{"text":"We arrived around 5:45 and waited 40 minutes for our food even though the restaurant wasn't very busy. While the quality of the food is decent, there was so much wasabi in my maki rolls and hand roll that I had trouble getting through my meal. It wasn't spread out, just a big glob of wasabi. So if aren't a fan of wasabi, definitely ask the servers to make note of that! Other than that, the food is good albeit a bit on the expensive side but the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friends. It's a tucked away place off of Queen St W but it gets packed. Make sure to make reservations at lunchtime or arrive right at opening.  I ordered the combination tempura special. It came with salad, rice, miso soup, mixed tempura, curry sauce and two small pieces of pork katsu all for an amazing price of $9.50, which is almost unheard of in the downtown core.  The tempura was light and flavourful and the portion size was very good.  The miso soup usually is forgettable at most places but I really enjoyed it here as the taste was spot on without being too salty. The pork katsu could have been a bit more tender but it was still nice.   My only other nitpicks were that the curry sauce was watery (not sure if it was supposed to be more of a soup or something) and it took a while for my food to come. However, the restaurant was very busy so it's understandable.   A visit here is definitely recommended. You get a lot of bang for your buck and you get a nice, quiet Japanese ambiance on top of that."}
{"text":"Good food but expect to have the worst service ever!! There is no host and the waiters do not acknowledge you ! The restaurant was half empty today and I waited for 20 minutes!  I left and checked in at queen mother where you are sure to have a better service"}
{"text":"Order the taKe sushi dinner. Mediocre really. Not worth $25. Honestly. I really think they can do better since this is a Japanese Japanese restaurant lol"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place, it's tucked out of the way on St. Patrick. If the Japanese restaurants in Toronto this one is a bit different. The facade you notice first, an old style, wooden decorated entranceway. The interior also is quite Spartan and simply decorated - forget the raucous spaces of Don Don or the elbow to elbow of most new sushi chains.  I always come back for the curry, noodle and rice dishes. In many Japanese restaurants, these are an afterthought, for a primarily sushi going customer base. But the rice dishes here are made with the same care and attention.   They've got sushi available, but honestly I go elsewhere for that. Ema Tei is a nice reminder that Japanese food doesn't have to be sushi to be done well."}
{"text":"I went here so many times and everytime I came here I ordered the beef tone. However, this time they just give us some shit that we can't even bite it! It was so overcooked!!!!!! I asked them to give me a new order but they said no. I asked them to take it back to my table and I would like to take a picture, and they said no, they already threw it. Not going to come here anymore!!"}
{"text":"Izakaya style - if I were a Japanese business person looking for a place to have snacky food and drinks after work, this would be the place.   The restaurant is easy to miss if you didn't know it was there.  It's larger inside than expected...but still cozy and dark.  The waitstaff is super courteous and nice. I felt welcome when I walked in.  I like drinks.  They had Japanese beers and I enjoyed my cassis and oolong tea.   We ate a lot of things including tempura, sashimi, rolls, katsu don, grilled fish, etc.   Standouts:  *Beef Tataki - Slices of beef sirloin, seared just over high heat but still raw on the inside. *Chicken Yakitori - They had several different types for tasting. *Scallops..buttery goodness..melt in your mouth.  A great place to go with a few of people to share different things. Portions are snack size. So, if you are hungry expect to spend a bit more...or you can order one of the boxes or entrees...but the other items are more fun.  Overall, a great spot and I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I came with my friends and got the nabeyaki udon. This place has interesting interior in that walls are decorated with kimono, old beer ads (Japanese), and other cool Japanese stuff, which added to the authentic experience. The food was alright, but the scallop and chicken piece were overcooked and became chewy. I would have liked to get some water when I got in, but otherwise the servers were alright as well. I'd say it's worth a visit when you're nearby, but considering the price range overall experience I am not in any hurry to come back again."}
{"text":"Overall: This place has such a cute Japanese vibe with wooden tables and tatamis in the back! Medium priced food that's quite authentic.   Location: On St. Patrick Street near Queen station.   Price: Each appetizer or small dish is around $7.5, the main bentos are between $15-20.  Food: I decided to get an appetizer and a semi-main mix just to try more things. I got the king oyster mushroom with butter which was delicious! It's so flavourful and chewy, but not too oily. The salmon roe ochazuke (rice with bonito soup) is very worth it! It was a great light, tasty combination to the butter mushrooms. I also got a plum wine which was very sweet and fragrant. The cold dipping noodles are very chewy. Overall I was very happy with my food selection!  Service: The main took about 15-20 minutes but they give you the drink and appetizers in around 10 minutes."}
{"text":"After an overdue visit to my once-favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto, betrayed is the only way to describe how I felt.  The restaurant looks like it had better days.  The once charming decor now seems negligent.  The server was very inexperienced, even though she tried her best (she spilled hot soup on one of our friends, and couldn't figure out how to tally our bill).  The food was not great.  I had a sashimi set which was not very fresh.  My friends had curry which was very obviously just instant curry.  I would award Ematei just one star, but for the memory of what it once was, I gave it an extra star.  There was a time when I would be willing to pay a premium price to eat at Ematei because I felt I was getting something authentic, but after my last visit, I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Ironically though, this may probably be the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Ematei is one of those restaurants that make you realize that there is more to Japanese food than just sushi and sashimi. Unfortunately, the current climate of the Japanese food scene in Toronto has popularized many misconceptions about what is authentic and not authentic. I think Ematei showcases common Japanese dishes that Japanese people would eat on a daily basis. Thus the food may be surprising and disappointing to many as I suspect many are too used to the pseudo-Japanese establishments run by Koreans and Chinese.  I've been here many times and every time I go there have always been other Japanese people dining here. All the waiters are Japanese and all the cooks seem to be Japanese. This is a good sign. You'll never find a Japanese person frequent \"Sushi on Bloor\" or \"New Generation\". That's not to say these other places suck (I frequent them too), but that many non-Japanese cooks who try to replicate Japanese dishes miss the core values and misinterpret the flavour profiles of Japanese cooking. And Japanese people are receptive to this as shown by the amount of Japanese people who go to Ematei but not other places. It's run by Japanese, for Japanese.  Authenticity aside, the food is excellent. I recommend getting their hot pots. Their chanko-nabe (a type of hotpot eaten by sumo wrestlers) can be shared with 2-3. It has a rich, hearty miso broth with an assortment of meats and vegetables. Their sukiyaki was also quite good. It is a soy based broth and they give you a two pots filled with different broths so you can balance the sweetness and saltiness of the hotpot to your preference. Like all sukiyaki, they give you raw eggs for you to dip your cooked meat in.  Not everything is perfect. Some side dishes can be a hit and miss and I think the ramen section is not really necessary. But regardless of some of these mishaps, I think Toronto desperately needs more places like this."}
{"text":"In Toronto, most Japanese restaurants can fit into one of these categories: sushi a la carte, ayce, omakase, ramen and izakaya.  This place was different since they also offered Japanese hot pot. Today, however I was craving udon which seems difficult to come by in this city. I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon which came with scallop, artificial crab, chicken and shrimp tempura.   The bowl of noodles came in a hot pot which was a different concept. The broth was extremely tasty creating a good balance between sweet and salty. The udon noodles were somewhat chewy and each seafood was cooked decently. The added condiments on top such as tempura crispies, seaweed, onions were a great touch. Overall a great bowl of noodles and soup.  Coming back in the future to try their family style hot pot and sushi."}
{"text":"So bad.... So very bad what a waste of money. McDonald's would have been better!! If you go keep walking the sushi is better at a truck stop. Main courses came before the appetizers. Some food was hot some cold. We where a group of 10 they charged us a 15% service charge which is fair however the did the calculations after tax I told them to fix it, they did."}
{"text":"I wished I never stumbled on their website while searching for sushi in Toronto. Their menu offers sushi or sashimi at a reasonable price so I decided to pay a visit. After ordering my sushi set did I settled in and looked around to see what other patrons were eating. I started to panic, nearly every table ordered sukiyaki, I grabbed my phone and turned to yelp for answers. Oh boy, now I wished I read the reviews before ordering my meal. Sukiyaki is apparently their best seller. Needless to say, my sushi set wasn't spectacular, the fish was meh and packed on a mountain bed of rice (I had to pick away some to make it portional)."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation. Someone told me that this place wasn't good, but another friend had suggest to try it, cause he was a fan.  As a result, I decided to give it a try. This place does not take debit and is not open on Mondays. As we walked in, we was greeted by the sushi chef. I was not sure what I wanted, so the sushi chef and another customer had recommended me a few dishes.   We had order take out: Ebi Shinjyo (shrimp meat balls), Grilled mackerel and eel on rice and came with mushroom miso soup,   The waitress, was very friendly and as we waited for the food, I could see a lot of the customer had order the hot pot, which smelled delicious.   I personally find this place cozy and based on my brief experience, I definitely will come here again and dine in to give it a shot and convenience.   The Ebi Shinjyo reminds me of those shrimp meat balls that you get at Chinese wedding or banquets, that come with the claw. It came with 3 and a deep fried leaf veggie which was delicious and something else I can't remember. I would say it is was good, but I still prefer the Chinese version ones, cause they are bigger and juicier.   The eel on rice, really hit the spot. the sauce, eel and rice was very satisfying. The mackerel was good, overall, I enjoyed it. It kinda reminds me of comfort food. Not amazing but still good.  As we left, people were asking if we had tried the place and if it was delicious. I presume this is sort of like a hidden gem that not many people know about.   Regardless, it does not hurt to try new things :)"}
{"text":"In my opinion (of which I have many!!), Ematei is one of the best and authentic Japanese restaurants in the city.  Tucked away underneath an office building and offset from the street, it is hidden away in an unlikely location on St. Patrick Street just steps away from Queen St.   I've been going to Ematei for years... probably from the time that it opened many, many moons ago.  Kaji of Sushi Kaji fame, I believe, was the chef who got the place going at the beginning and the staff who are there now have been there since I was a wee young 'un.  It is super consistent and one of the first places in Toronto to offer omakase.  Ematei's strength is that the dishes served up from the kitchen is on par, if not better, than the items from the sushi bar.  But the sushi is nothing to sniff at either -- fresh and uncomplicated, which is exactly what sushi should be (don't get me started on those mayonnaise and spicy sauce laden rolls that pass for sushi in this town).  We generally start with a bunch of tapas-like small appetizers of fish (like black cod or salmon neck or belly), tofu (like agedashi or hiyayakko), chicken (yakitori or karaage), stewed veggies and the like which are all shared.  And then finished off with a ramen, zarusoba, udon, or chazuke.  Ematei is like walking into a little slice of a Japanese izakaya.  It's longevity is a testament to the quality and consistency of their offerings.  Looking for one of the best and authentic in Toronto?  Definitely try Ematei."}
{"text":"This place offers more of home-cooking comfortness of Japanese cusine. Sashimi I've tried was so-so but considering almost every Japanese restaurants in Toronto ordering their fish from pretty much  the same suppliers, I assume it'll be hard to stand out. it wasn't awesome but it wasn't bad.  Sukiyaki was amazing though. very similar to what I had in Japan. for table cooking this is far by the best Japanese place I've been. (in Toronto) Black cod ... melts in your mouth. over all I had very pleasant dinner and will go back again for table cooking.  +this place hurts your wallet though."}
{"text":"We ordered Changko Nabe and it tasted decent. But the service was bad! Servers looked upset or something and gave us a dirty look! And I was eating the food but a server took my plate because there was a long waiting line. No one refilled our water as well. I wouldn't visit this restaurant again because of the bad service!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, bad food, no wonder the place is empty. We were there for dinner...their menu was confusing as hell and frankly had nothing that were appetizing. We asked the waitress who couldn't really speak English what was good...it took nearly 5 mins for her to understand and gave some generic suggestions, which I just did not want to follow. The salad we ordered was $8 and was supposed to have beef tongue in it. Well, it had little slivers of beef...but definitely was not beef tongue and tasted horrible. The rest of the food was nothing to write home about. Will not be retuning ever and I think they are closed to shutting down. I can see that the chef and waitresses have simply stopped trying."}

{"text":"Love this restaurant!!!!  Here are my favorite items: Beef tataki sea urchin sushi black sesame ice cre black cod roll"}
{"text":"I have no words for this place. Truly an amazing experience from beginning to end. Got the giant hot pot meal with family and we had a hard time finish it (3 of us eating 1)... The service is a little slow, but it was a full house and they don't seem to have a POS system (or at least didn't see one)... So they write everything. The waitress we had helped us cook the first part of our meal and then we cooked the rest throughout the night. Highly recommend to try this place though!"}
{"text":"i'm sure this place is better than 1 star, but let me tell you WHY i'm giving it 1 star.  i've heard great things about this restarant from a friend so one night, we all decided to go.  since i recently got back from Japan, my friend wanted me to go to a japanese restaurant that is actually owned by japanese people here in toronto.  with a HUGE craving for tonkatsu curry rice, i believed i wouldn't be disappointed (again, from the great things i've heard).  arrived at the restaurant and ordered my meal.  30 mins later the waitress comes out and says this....  \"sorry, we have no more rice\"    yes... you read that right!!  she said they were out of rice!!!  it was only 8pm *still some what dinner time on a saturday night*.  i'm so baffled beyond belief!!  how can you own a japanese restaurant, or i guess you can even say an asian restaurant and have NO RICE?!?!?!??!  it's like going to a bar and saying, sorry, no beer!  *sigh*  at that point... i wanted to just leave.  u don't understand how disappointing it was when you have this MAD craving for something, and you're missing out on the most simplest thing!  btw, the waitress' english wasn't that great.  she later did explain that if we wanted rice.. we'd have to wait another 45 mins.  at this point, i'm NOT waiting that long for my meal since i've already waited 30 mins.  plus my friends who ordered sushi, already got and finished their meal!!  yes.. they had sushi rice.. but no normal steamed rice.  anyways, i then asked the girl if the ramen was good.  of course she answered \"oishii desu!\" (it's delicious) ... i ordered it anyways.  soon after i got it and let me tell you folks!! do NOT ever.. i REPEAT.. DO NOT ORDER RAMEN at this restaurant.  worst ever!!  well... not WORST.. just in par with instant noodles.  infact.. it felt like i was eating instant noodles.  so ya... that explains why i'm giving this restaurant 1 star.   i will go back cause i'm STILL craving that tonkatsu (been 3 weeks now since i've left japan)  but if they're out of rice again, i might just fall on the floor crying.  NO RICE!!!  seriously!!! how?!?!?!? i'm still just as confused and surprised.  they totally dropped the ball BIG TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for the Sukiyaki!  that was the reason why we came here and it did not disappoint.!  could feed at least 3 people for sure!   quality of meat was very good as it had good marbling on it... highly recommend the agedashi tofu as well!  it was one of the best i've ever had...  also ordered spicy tuna roll, it was too spicy.. nothing special.. also got a miso soup.. was okay and nothing special... service and price/value wise was great!  seems like all the bad / poor reviews are from people that didnt order the Sukiyaki which is what this place is known for.. pretty much the majority of the tables got a sukiyaki from what i saw.. 100% will be back to Ematei!  THANKS!  WOOF!"}
{"text":"This is pretty hidden and I've passed this many times, looks very shady from outside, didn't even know it was a restaurant. Bad marketing?  Checked it out because of the reviews. It's a very nice and pleasant place. The sushi was really good as well, small bite size and not cold. It was good but nothing unique and for this price I didn't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Guess what: California rolls are not real Japanese food. Neither is sushi pizza or dragon rolls. Chicken or beef teriyaki is also not actually Japanese (authentic teriyaki is for broiled fish).  What is very authentic Japanese is the menu, the decor, the drinks list, the cooks and the waitresses at Ematei. It is by far the most Japanese place I've found in Toronto, and my opinion is reinforced by the number of expats who eat here regularly. In fact, it helps to speak some Japanese if you're ordering at Ematei since the wait staff is very much ESL.   Having spent most nights of the week in an izakaya (pub) during my stint in Japan, I was really missing the small dishes of comfort food and the homey atmosphere that don't get reproduced in Toronto's Japanese-inspired restaurants.   Some of my favourite Ematei izakaya dishes: aspara-bacon (asparagus wrapped in bacon, yesss!), butter scallops, mushroom foil, buta kimchi (okay, that's Korean), zaru soba, kabocha tempura and yakitori. I don't recommend the kani foil since it's not real crab. The unagi chahan (they call it 'charan' for some reason) is great.  Something awesome for winter is that you can reserve one of the tatami rooms for a nabe party, which is the Japanese version of a hot pot party.  Note: I haven't had the sushi at Ematei. When there are a thousand other places for sushi in this city, I like to order things that are less ubiquitous.   Bonus: Do you know what 'Ematei' means? An 'ema' is a small wooden wishing plaque that can be purchased at Shinto shrines. 'Tei' means shop, so 'Ematei' is 'shop for prayer plaques'."}
{"text":"Ematei is one of the few authentic Japanese style restaurants that I know of in Toronto.   I like their decor and mood, great place for a group of friends to meet, a date, or even a casual dinner with family.  I've only been here for dinner, and usually the prices are a bit higher and some things feel overpriced. However, the food is always delicious.  I have never tried their sashimi and sushi yet, but i see a lot of people ordering it as well as their hot pot items.  I have tried their: Baked oysters - Perfect BBQ Duck - Juicy meat, delicious flavor Curry Pork Cutlet - Lots of curry sauce for the rice, crispy Pork Salmon Roe Ochazuke - Tasty Salmon roe in a nice light tea broth, great for a snack or a small meal BBQ Chicken leg - well made, bbq sauce is great. BBQ Chicken skin - Crispy and delicious! Chicken soft bone - Crunchy and can't eat just one! Tonkatsu Egg Rice Bowl - Love the sauce that goes with it, its nicely made, filling and satisfying.  Also to add, their tonkatsu and egg rice bowl is also one of the better ones i've had in toronto region.   I try my best to try new items everytime I visit this restaurant, and try to not spend too much while I'm at it.  Definitely give this place a try, it is an enjoyable and cozy experience!"}
{"text":"I cannot think of anything bad to say about this place other than the prices are definitely high. But if you play with your order a little bit, the total bill won't kill you. Just don't try to order the whole menu.  My favourite dish from this place is definitely the raw shrimp. They are big and flavourful at times.  I often order their Chirashi Don. It is fresh and good value compare with some other joint. But today, i tried out the Ematei Ramen.  I tried to get more hot food this time around. I like the noodles and the meat. I was surprised with the butter added to the noodle. A cheap and easy way to add flavor to it.   i also ordered the Black cod head appetizer. That was the highlight of the day.   It just makes me to order maybe just hot dishes on my next visit. BTW. One of the reason that this place is my favourite after so many years is their giant menu.  Compare to other authentic Japanese restaurant, their menu is just massive. i highly recommend this place over the others."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at 7:30, arrived on time. I was told we have to wait because there are still people waiting. the guy who work both as a chef and a reception was rude af - 'I will get you a table when it's ready' just an order, no apology.  I mean what's the point of making a reservation?    We wait for 10 minutes and I started to complain and asking why our seats are not reserved. 'You want to keep waiting or you want to leave?' Said the same old man. Really? That's the attitude you serve your guests in a Japanese restaurant?    I Will never come back again and I suggest you guys be aware of that. Unless you are willing to pay overpriced food for below average services."}
{"text":"Came by on black Friday, where every restaurant near the mall was completely packed with lines going out the doors. We ended up trekking a block over in a particularly sketchy side street with little lighting and came upon this restaurant at the side of the road.  Upon entering, there were a couple groups waiting. The sushi bar was up near the front, but the chefs were busy behind the counter. No one was around to greet us, so we looked around and noticed a little notebook a bit further inside on a table. One of the chefs then shouted over to us telling us to just write ourselves on the list.  Some time later, one of the chefs came over with the notebook calling out our name, and one of the waitresses seated us.  I ordered the nabeyaki using, as it seemed to be a popular option in the other reviews. Because we ordered different dishes, some of us got some miso soup, while I received a piece of wood. Confused.  Later it became clear that I was getting a hot metal pot that was to be placed on the wood.  The pot itself was not particularly large. The images were definitely designed so that the dish filled up the entire frame, when in reality the diameter of the pot was about half the length of your disposable chopsticks (which is also interesting to see in this kind of setting).  Service was mostly nonexistent. Perhaps because it was a really busy night? I ended up taking out my water bottle and refilling my cup. Maybe I could have just flagged a waitress down.  The udon was alright. Nothing really stood out. They have a large menu so perhaps this was not one of the more interesting options, as tables nearby were all doing hotpot.  There were some issues with the other dishes at our table and the way the waitresses and even the chef handled it was amusing at best (maybe not for the one complaining).  Eh, I don't know. Maybe I need to come with people that are familiar with this place and/or the staff to get a better experience."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. The most disappointed part was the communication. We only had one menu for three of us and we asked our waitress for more menus. She looked very confused and asked me if I wanted a drinking menu. We ended with looking at one menu coz we failed to get her understand it's not convenient for three people to share one menu. Other things like, she asked if we were still working on the hotpot. My friend said yes, but she was taking the dish away.....One of us got really frustrated there."}
{"text":"I know sushi very well, but I don't know Japanese food all that well.  While sushi is a tiny sliver of what Japanese has to offer, I soon found out the rest of the cuisine at Ematei.   I can't say I personally loved it, especially since the bill reached 30$ (after tax and tip) and I didn't feel like it was amazing.  but I can attest to Ematei have 100% Japanese Staff and many 90% Japanese customers.  This little restaurant is nice if you know and can appreciate the full spectrum of Japanese cuisine, but I will admit, I am only in it for the sashimi and rolls (of which they were above average for Toronto, aka- not drowning the sushi in mayo or excessively battered deep fried grossness).  Yes, ematei is \"authentic\" and was suggested by a Japanese friend of mine.  I probably would only come back if somebody demanded I take them to an authentic Japanese owned and operated restaurant.  The food is good, just not great.  and more pricey than I care to spend for a few pieces of quality raw fish.  The menu has a variety of appetizer sized things that hover at about $10.  Then they have some nice udon and fried rice bowls (VERY glutinous rice) that range from 12-15$.  If you want sushi you can get 15 or so pieces for about 25-30$.   Nothing stuck out for me, although service was good quality.  The atmosphere kind of looks like its in a basement even when it is ground level.  No natural light here.  But the atmosphere is cozy and reminds me of sushi bars back home in Vanouver.  Even though there isn't really inspired izakaya type food, the menu and feel of the place is more like an izakaya than most of the mediocre Japanese places Toronto offers."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a good bowl of Nabeyaki Udon in the downtown core.  Sushi is acceptable too.   A little hidden, but that can be a good thing as there is less chance of a lineup during the lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"how do you know if the restaurant is good at making their authentic food of choice? you look at the restaurants' clients... and if most of them are of the same naitonality that the restaurant represents then you probably came to the right place.  that's a good example of Ematei. Most of the clients are expats from Japan.  the atmosphere is very quiet and inspires conversations.  there is a room at the back that can be split into 2 smaller rooms for 4 and 6 people. with a traditional low table behind wall dividers  the food was great with a whole vegetarian menu selection. some choices are unique or at least new to me. I tried rolls with tomatos and wasabi (ok wasabi was a surprise that I didn't really like) and rolls with avocados and salty plum paste - very refreshing and yummy. the prices are great too for downtown location and authentic japanese expereince.   it's very well hidden so you won't bump onto this restaurant randomly unless you are really looking for it."}
{"text":"Taste is goood, especially the sukiyaki (Japanese style hot pot). Though the restaurant may last for a time so the environment was not so good."}
{"text":"its a 3.5 stars at least.  The first time coming to this restaurant so really don't know what to expect from this restaurant. The look and feel made it look like it's authentic Japanese restaurant.  Since the weather today is quite cold so I really feel like having something hot and therefore we choose the Sukiyaki, the beef hot pot, and an order of Sushi just to see what the sushi is like. The service staff there are quite friendly and made me feel I am welcomed in this restaurant!  For the Beef hotpot, the portion is quite big but considering it is $68, looks about right. It's served with an iron pot and somehow, it made this hotpot experience a lot more appealing to me (yea, I am kinda wierd..it is just a regular iron pot :) ). This hotpot has a numbers of ingredient such as: tofu, mushroom, enoki mushroom, vegetables, onions, beef ... and it also come with beaten egg to eat with the hotpot food. The taste is what I expected for a Sukiyaki and I am not disappointed.  We also ordered one order of Sushi.. we got Hamachi sushi and it actually has fish taste to it! quite good! When I come next time, I will focus more in trying out their Sushi! As mentioned, will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"I honestly like this place so much because of their food. But the service, to be exact, their staff's attitude is not as good as their food. Probably because they are never short of customers, they honestly don't care whether you come or not. Every time you entered the restaurant, they asked you if you have made a reservation. But the truth is, they never picked up their phone!! Last night, I tried to call them like more than 10 times but nobody answered the phone! So I came early today at 5:40pm just right after they opened and they told me it is all full and we will have to wait 90minutes.  As always, they asked you if you made reservations. I was so pissed this time and I went to another restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"I try the Unagi-don, and some BBQ meat, the BBQ may be the traditional Japanese style( I am a Chinese, not the Pro for taste the Japanese food), but I do not like this BBQ because the taste not different between other BBQ in Toronto. The Unagi-don use the \" dry BBQ cooking style\" to cook it, for that style may be the best, but I do not like that style because it is too dry! I love the style is much sauce on rice!  In the end I order the pudding for dessert, taste so-so, just feel little dissatisfactory for this restaurant, the food not worth their price on the menus?"}
{"text":"Friendly japanese restaurant that puts out tasty japanese comfort dishes like ramen, yakitori, grilled fish, donburi. Sushi is decent but can be had better elsewhere. Stick to the cooked food. Lot of Japanese expats or businessman can be seen here too for homecooked dishes. I like the tempura-nicely fried not too oily, nabeyaki udon and beef sukiyaki is a treat too if find someone to split it with. They also do shabu-shabu too for groups of people! Decor seems very early nineties. ;)"}
{"text":"I thought it was excellent.  Once walking through the doors you feel like you've been transported into a japanese izakaya.  I was excited to bring my parents here to try some more aunthentic japanese food, as opposed to the chinese version we get.   They have a long long list appetizers ranging from grilled eggplant, to soft bone chicken, to hotate butter (yum), to soft shell crab. Prices were good ranging from ($3-7 each, hotate was more $11.95) and good quantities to share. You could build a whole meal out of these appetizers izakaya style.   I got the Omakase for $48. It was a lot of food, and good enough to share for 2 ppl + 1 to 2 appetizers.   It was delicious! Including Sashimi, soba noodles, black cod, pickled sardines, tofu, grilled eggplant, sushi and dessert among others (7 dishes). It was a good variety, however my dad did point out that the ingredients were not something amazing, but something common but dressed up delicately (i.e. miso tofu, jellies+ fruits for dessert).  I recommend this totally for a date. It's quiet and you can find a nice spot with shareable food.  There is also a tatami room at the back, good for larger groups.   The sashimi was quite good. you can get 6 pcs of your choice for $10.50 or get a meal out of it for $27.00 of a variety + soup+salad. Or an appetizer version for less.  It's really fresh, and of a great quality. I've had better, but I think it's quite good at this price point.   This is something different. Worth the visit!  So with all this food - sashimi app, 1 order of salmon sashimi, katsu don, soft bone chicken, hotate butter and omakase + small sake = iit was $40 a person and we were super full (3ppl)"}
{"text":"Authentic af and thus, really good and REALLY EXPENSIVE. Goddamn, does food add up quickly. Also, don't let the front of house fool you--it's like a clown car in there, with more room than you'd expect. It's basically a Tardis or the House of Leaves, but without the fanboyishness or pretension that comes with either, respectively."}
{"text":"I  had the sushi lunch special which was a roll with deep fried salmon, 5 pieces of nigiri, and 2 pieces of cucumber roll.  It came with miso soup and a small salad.  The sushi was disappointing.  The pieces were quite small and I was surprised that the fish in the roll was deep fried.  The miso soup and salad was light and refreshing.  Service was prompt and polite.  I will try again only because it's close to my office and it beats food court sushi."}
{"text":"I went along with 8 friends with 6:30 pm reservations on a Saturday evening and took the inside large square table.  We did our drink orders where one of them got Umeshu, and was asked if she wanted it 'On the Rocks' and she said sure.  Knowing she has had Umeshu before, she told me it didn't taste as good.  Do wait staff usually ask if you want it 'On the Rocks'?  Reading from a prior review that it is an Izakaya style and I got off work to go there, I got Yakitori apps (gizzards, skin, wings, meatballs, hearts).  Basically the 5 left-side items on the Yaki selection.  Salt or soya option, and my friendly waitress suggested salt, Arigato!  Aside from wings being 3 middle pieces for $4.50, I really enjoyed it.    I got the Soba as well, which is standard fare for any other Jap restaurant.  I tried a piece of Chicken Katsu, and it wasn't bad but I was admiring about 3-4 of my friend's shared Seafood Nabe and another friend's fresh looking Chirashi.  The whole group kept chatting it up, laughing maybe even bothering other customers from time to time and we eventually over stay our welcome when we just sat their with our empty tea cups continuing our conversations as the waitress brought over the bill and started to clean up around 9:30 - 10:00 pm or so.    I have to say the wait staff are awesome and I guess I personally enjoyed the traditional feel of the decor.  About 30min before we left, I told my friend there doesn't seem to be music, but then when we got up to leave we heard some Mexican music?  Anyone can confirm that?"}
{"text":"Though it was a little wait the sushi was excellent and highly recommend here. Have been coming here off and in for 30 years and it's always good."}
{"text":"I am only giving them one star because I am not allowed to rate them for 0 star.   1. Service: Worst experience ever!!!! Got a lot of attitude from them(waitress and a man that seems like the restaurant owner). We asked them several times to refill the water, they said yes and then just not doing it. When we asked for bill and the POS machine, we literally had to wait for more than 30 min!!! And when we got declined using the credit card due to accidentally entered wrong PIN number, the waitress refused to let us try again using the same card and even questioned if we have enough money to pay! RUDE! 2. Food: Food was ok, not bad but definitely not amazing. We had the sukiyaki(hot pot), it was just average. But be careful when you order water, every cup of water will cost you $2.  Overall terrible place to eat, will never come back. And if anyone is reading this review, stay away from this restaurant"}
{"text":"Tucked in from the hustle of Queen Street W. this place transports you to Japan. There is even an authentic samurai enclosed in glass here! haha. Also for a larger group you can get one of those private rooms where you sit on the floor with your shoes off. (Wear cool socks). The staff are very friendly in spite of the language barrier (Hey even more authenticly japanese). The food is cheap and it's really fresh and tasty.  I've read reviews here where people have recommended aspara-bacon.....I couldn't find it on the menu and the waitress was very confused when I asked for it. (I had a japanese friend w/ me who helped me out and still no luck) -but anyways the hotate (scallops w/ sauteed onions in butter sauce) was really good. The beef ribs are soo tender. If you get the sushi/sashimi combo they put wasabi between the rice and the fish so you dont have to keep applying your wasabi.   -Once the sushi chefs see that your a regular they treat you like old friends. That's pretty darn cool."}
{"text":"I'm like 3.5 stars? I really like a restaurant with some polish, and this place is a bit drab ... you can tell it's been around for a long, long time. I know I've been hearing about it for a while. It's worn around the edges. But it really does deserve that half star because the food is quite good and it's surprisingly affordable, though not necessarily *cheap.*  Plenty of seating. Quiet on a Tuesday evening. Very casual. The service is fine -- polite, some servers are more friendly than others, and could be a bit more prompt, but no complaints.  Two of us had:  - Gyoza ($6 for 5)  They gave us options of deep-fried or pan-fried, and we took pan. They were good -- again, not too greasy.   - Chicken soba - Tempura udon (2 shrimp, 3-4 veggies, including  a lettuce leaf ??? which was surprisingly good)  Noodle bowls ran something like $11-14. The udon was good -- thick, springy. The boyfriend thought the soba was thinner than he was used to, but he liked it. The broth was great ... not too strong, but clean-tasting and not too salty at all. It didn't feel .. industrial.   I just wish they had more carnivorous options for the noodles -- most were vegetarian. Still, that's what ordering a side of yakitori is for, right?  - A beer for him - A vodka and soda for me w/ lemon  They gave me a whole half lemon and a lemon squeezer! All their mixed drinks are pretty cheap. I wish they had a website, but if I recall correctly, mine was only $5.   We finished off with ice cream. They have green tea or ginger (two good-sized scoops a serving) for $2, or sesame (which is one scoop for $2 or two scoops for $4.50).   Our total with tax and tip was just under $55. Nice. They don't take debit, but they do take credit.  Thinking back to the menu, Ematei seems to charge for their food, not their drinks or desserts. I notice some other reviewers say their sushi is not worth the price; I did remember seeing somewhat high prices for the sushi.   Throughout the meal, I kept thinking how I wish I had ordered more food ... yet when I was done with my ice cream, I was perfectly stuffed.   Back when Toronto had far fewer options when it came to izakaya-style food, I can see how Ematei stood head and shoulders above all, especially downtown. I think now that Ryoji, Guu, and Hapa are in town, their impact has been lessened.   I may not be in love with the decor, but I'd still be back for their cooked food. They have yakitori skewers for $2 and a variety of other small dishes for $5-8. The couple right next to us had hot pot ... maybe I'll try that next time. Or omakase (still $48)!"}
{"text":"Has been quite steady for it's food quality. Service is ok too. Although last time gave me a huge steel spoon to eat a delicate chirashi rice dish. Pricy but quite fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing! Just went here with co workers for a team lunch and I didn't expect much thinking that it would be just another japanese restaurant on queen.  This place is spectacular! Highly recommended and will return to try other dishes.  Food: 4/5, I got the combination box with mixed tempura, pork cutlets rolls, soup-salad and rice. I'm glad I got this like my c workers but the sushi looked good too.  The rice is well cooked and tempura was nice and crispy and they were not stale like some other places around the area.  Service: 3/5, very nice but they could be more attentive with waters etc.  Ambience: 3/5, comfortable seating, cool dark decor and quiet enough and tables are spaced apart for good conversations.  Price: 3/5, very comparable to others in the area. About $10-15 per person for lunch and perhaps a bit more for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, ordered a few things it was not half bad and the price is a bit too expensive."}
{"text":"My first Japanese hot pot experience was AMAZING (and felt authentic)! I got to try the best miso soup base ever; it was super flavourful, rich, and shames every other variation of itself. We had an assortment of shrimp, chicken, beef, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, meatballs, and udon. It was more than enough for the 3 of us. We also ordered chicken karaage (fried chicken) as an appetizer, which was nothing special, but still tasty :)"}
{"text":"The beef hot pot is really enough for 3 person, we had a lot left with 2 person. You can customize the taste of your soup base. They have a wide choice on drinks. The service were nice, but they seem don't speak English well. Gonna try their sushi and other stuffs next time."}
{"text":"Ematei is a classic Japanese restaurant in the city. I feel like I go to it once in a while every year or two. Definitely the dish(es) people get are the Japanese hot pot, more specifically I believe people lean towards the sukiyaki. It's funny cause the reason why my friends and I go to this place is actually for their Japanese curry. It's relatively cheap and a palatable dish. My suggestion though when coming on a weekend is to make a reservation. The wait will definitely test your patience if you don't. I've also had the sushi (because I feel I need to try sushi at any Japanese restaurant) which is executed relatively cleanly. Note that all sushi has wasabi in it."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and I think it is better to make a reservation or you might need to wait for a long time. Sukiyaki is good, it really has enough beef for 3 people (me and my female friend couldn't finish) I would definitely recommend their fried tofu (pic 3, can't remember its name), it was so tasty that we wanted to order another plate"}
{"text":"My family and I tried the omakase late last year. Additionally, we ordered the hotate butter, nabeyaki udon and pork katsu curry - all of which were a hit. I personally loved that Ematei offered warabimochi! Although nothing mind-blowing to the average visitor, this brought back memories of summer days in Japan. Ematei makes good food with good portions and is fantastically priced. It was only $30 (incl tax) to abundantly nourish a hungry group of 5.   The omakase included: Miso Tofu Meat Sashimi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, white fish) Sushi (tuna, salmon, eel, fish roe) Black cod Grilled eggplant with a custard-like toppin Scallops Zaru Soba Fruit with jelly"}
{"text":"The hot food here are really the stars - although, I have not tried the sushi, so cannot speak to that. On various occasions, I've tried the bento box with fried chicken (the skin is nice and crispy while the meat is tender and juicy).  The cold soba noodles dipped in sauce is also nice - the tempura bits and finely sliced green onions are a nice touch (and delicious).  The seafood udon bowl with raw egg was delicious and tasted like something my mother would make me if I was sick (a la chicken soup for the soul), although I do wish the pot was just a tad bigger with a bit more noodles.   The only dish that fell a bit short for me was as curry special with chicken and veggies. Although the flavour was good, the two tiny pieces of chicken in my bowl was disappointing, and I would have preferred the veggies (turnip and carrots) to be cooked longer in a curry dish.   I have only been here during lunch hours, and it is always packed. I will aim to come back to enjoy the dinner hot pots, as they look amazing.   I agree with the previous reviewer that this is best Japanese place I've tried in all of Toronto.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced, with an atmosphere that is inviting and cosy."}
{"text":"Ematei is one of the few a la cart Japanese restaurants hidden in the downtown core.  Consider this place is just around 10-15 minutes walk away from the financial district, coming here for a lunch or dinner is not a bad option.  The decoration of this restaurant is nice, however, the inside is very dim and I personally do not like dim places, so I wasn't a big fan of the environment.  Food wise, I had been here 2 times, once for lunch and once for dinner, and both times, I thought the food was decent.  Sashimi was fresh and the sushi was well displayed in the dinner sushi combo.  For the price I paid, the combo already came with Eel, Salmon Roe and Uni, which are considered as higher end sushi and I am happy to share they were fresh and tasted wonderful!   Service wise, lunch time they are super busy so don't expect much service, but dinner time I though the waitress was very attentive and kept checking with me if I was having a good time.  3 solid stars for this restaurant!  Only negatives I had was the dim environment and the slightly higher than average price."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a Japanese restaurant tucked away off Queen St. W., I could tell Ema Tei was a great find the moment I stepped in. The waitress bowed as she welcomed us and led us to our seats. The restaurant was long and rectangular, with a few private booths and two for group dining booths in the back with floor cushions for a more traditional feel.  Service was attentive and the food arrived quickly.  The \"mystery\" white fish sashimi tasted like sea perch, luscious and soft. Presentation was average, the slices could have been thinner and cleaner. There was a hint of ammonia in the aftertaste, but Toronto isn't exactly a fishing village.  The eggplant appetizer was drenched in a delicious house sauce, although the eggplants themselves were quite runny.  The BBQ tuna roll was delicious, although it seemed that they skipped a few steps in making the sushi rice. The sushi rice had not been cooled long enough, and the vinegar-to-rice-to-sesame-seeds ratio was off.  The giant roll really was giant. It was bursting with half a dozen ingredients, including salmon roe, avocado, tobiko, and egg. When I say bursting, I mean it literally: it was hard to eat since the ingredients kept falling out. While the roll ranked low on the authenticity scale, it ranked high on the value scale.  The katsudon arrived last. It was aromatic and mouthwatering: a huge bowl of rice topped with katsu strips, caramelized onions, scrambled eggs, and green onions. It made me wish I had ordered less so I would have more room for it.  All in all, this is definitely a place worth returning to."}
{"text":"The Suriyaki was really good! But it is kind of big so it's better if you have at least 3 people to order the Suriyaki.   The eel was great too! Overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Best Sukiyaki in Toronto indeed. Unadon (grilled eel rice bowl)was so delicious! This place was a little bit crowded but cozy. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic Japanese food. They have great nigiri sushi and fresh sashimi. I'd recommend the tuna rolls and Chirashi Bowl. Their grilled fish are also great and I also love having their steamed egg custard on the side. My favourite is probably the Nabeyaki Udon - I haven't had better udon in any other restaurant in Toronto/GTA - the broth is just absolutely fantastic. Their hot pots seem to be what they're popular for, but I've come here several times and never felt inclined to order it even though the entire restaurant is filled with the lovely smell of the broth when you walk in. Will definitely have to stop by again to try it."}
{"text":"This was a nice a spot. Friendly staff. Food was good. We had the nabeyaki? Udon. It was Delicious. It was also reasonably priced. I wasn't a fan of the decor, but hats less important. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Came here several months for a family event. Got several sushi items plus the hot pot.  1) Service was poor. Waitress seemed like she didn't care about us and rarely refilled our drinks.   2) Food was decent. It wasn't ultra high quality and for the price you pay, Jabistro or Japango are much better quality. The hot pot had a nice soup base but it was very expensive. I'm not sure if this is normal for a Japanese hot pot but you're essentially paying for the soup base and fresh ingredients. Not worth it in my books.   I would not come back here as there are much better jap places that have amazing sushi and service."}
{"text":"Sukiyaki is best for special occasions or for a celebration , which is perfect for my birthday and the cold weather ! This is about $80 If I recall , it is pricy but way more than enough for 2 people ! I feel like 3 could eat It ! I also had sushi and miso soup (will post more photos soon) prior to this . This Nabemono also comes with 2 dipping sauces which contains raw egg yolks (I'm sure it's pasteurized eggs , it's safe !) and 2 rice bowls !  The sukiyaki includes handful amount of beef, and lots of delicious vegetables! It doesnt seem much but as said , it's a huge portion and enough to feed 2-3 people !  The waitress presents the platter along with 2 bowls of rice and 2 raw egg yolk dipping sauces ! The waitress then places the meat first with the portable stove turned on , and then adds the rest of the ingredients carefully,  Sukiyaki would initially be beautifully organized as shown , as presentation is quite the key to it , not much like how many of us just dump in our food haha !  The waitress adds in warashita (broth which contains soy sauce , mirin, sake , and sugar ) from the coffee pot they provided and water as well to dilute it slightly . As shown , this is basically Kanto-style Sukiyaki ! After all that youre left to deal the rest yourself so destroy it while you can! The broth tasted very sweet ! Its not like the other kind of traditional hotpots , since I'm the type who's obsessed with spicy or tomyum . I ate with a girlfriend of mine and we were totally stuffed !! There were still small leftovers we couldn't finish off as well. The  vegetables were fresh and so was the meat ! It's a thicker cut than your typical shabu shabu /hot pot meats. Service was perfect !  For $80, its totally worth it ! This is one of the only places thats popular for Sukiyaki , I've seen many people ordered it as well , along with some udons or Chanko Nabe (another kind of nabemono/ hot pot, like sukiyaki but with udon and some seafood ). I would like to try MeNami's sukiyaki one day , and probably other places that might offer it ! In the end , it was an amazing experience and hope to return with friends for the tatami room !"}
{"text":"Ematei is a real hidden gem! Even though I gave it a 3-star rating, I still consider it a gem because of how authentic the look and feel of the restaurant is! ( Also it's really hidden, and I've walked past the restaurant without realizing there was one). Reminds me a little bit of my time in Japan. The wooden walls and deco were on point!  I had the lunch special, which was the Sukiyaki.i thought it was just meh, but that was also my first time  trying it. Perhaps, I'm just not a fan of the dish. I still thought that the presentation was great, although they could add a little bit more meat. But for $8.50, I really didn't expect much.   I'd definitely be coming back to try other things like the curry dishes, Udons and sushi. Will update my review then!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Ematei. All the dishes were delicious and authentic. I especially liked the black cod. \"Americanized\" Japanese food is nice in it's own way, but this was a welcome change of pace."}
{"text":"Trying to figure out what to eat for dinner last night, my friend and I ended up at Ematei.  He mentioned an \"authentic Japanese restaurant\", so I decided to check it out with him. If it wasn't for him, I would've definitely overlooked this place.  It's like a hidden gem on St. Patrick.  It was a Monday night, so not many people were in the restaurant - so we quickly got a seat.  A little dark on the inside, it was a little quaint place, and fairly relaxing.  There was quite the selection hefty - so it took us forever to decide what we wanted.  Not only that, my friend and I decided to share the food among us both.  So that a bit longer.  The waitress quickly brought out a small appetizer that contained pickled vegetables for us to start.  Using my trust Yelp app for the BlackBerry - I got to see the other reviews to see what everyone else recommended.  So here's the food that we got from most recommended to the least (however, all dishes were great!): 1) GRILLED BLACK COD: This was absolutely delicious; had a little buttery taste to it, and the fish was the smoothest I've ever had.  Definitely a recommend! 2) HOTATE BUTTER: Butter scallops with carmelized onions in a sizzling dish.  I was so amazed by how the flavours worked together.  I never had buttered scallops before, so I have nothing to compare to, but it was better than the hotate carpaccio that I had a Guu Izakaya. 3) ASPARA BACON: I like bacon, I like asparagus.  'Nuff said. 4) MISO SOUP: Not your typical miso soup - they added some enoki mushrooms to give it more flavour.  Loved it! 5) BEEF TONGUE: (Forgot what it's called on the menu).  Just a bit too chewy for my liking.  I think they added a bit of pepper on it for taste.  Overall, a great experience.  A bit on the pricier side -- I think it was about $50-$60 for those dishes in total."}
{"text":"As many of the posts indicate, Ematei is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants in Toronto. It is izakaya style, meaning small plates are served here for sharing.   I've been here a couple of times now, but the last time I went, I got some serious food poisoning!!!!  I had their sashimi and sushi for the first time when I got sick, so I am guessing that this was the problem. :(    Unfortunately that left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) and I will not be coming back to Ematei............"}
{"text":"I'd give 0 star if I have the option.  I haven't been here for two years and I now remembered why. Overpriced food with really poor food quality.  I have ordered a variety of items on the menu like yakitori, grilled fish, grilled meat, tempura, fried sexy caramari legs, eggplant, shiitake butter and sushi.  Yakitori - dried and chewy, salty Grilled salmon - very dry Grilled PC tonge - overlooked and salty Tempura - dry Fried caramari - dry and chewy Eggplant - taste ok, not outstanding Shiitake butter - really salty Sushi - same quality as other chain restaurant like ichiban. So not bad not surprising either.   Need I say more? The food is generally overly salty and dry which is all I can say.  This will be the last chance I'm giving them for sure. There are just too many better restaurants to choose from in downtown."}
{"text":"Food is always decent.   Had a horrible server this week. Went it at non-peak hours. Lots of tables. I asked for a specific table, and the watiress said it was for 4 people only. I looked around and told her there's nobody here. One of the chefs overheard and apologized and let me sit where I wanted. She was horrible, she didn't even offer the warm towel afterwards and just asked another server to take my order."}
{"text":"I have not been here since about 5 or 6 years ago and I am still a fan of it. I tried their conch soup which they placed a very hot soup inside a conch shell and allow you to hold the conch's end to pour into a small shot cup to drink from. Very creative way of eating the delicacy.  I also ordered the Botan Ebi ($20 for 5 pieces) sashimi and I have to admit - for the price you pay for is very good and large piece. Other places easily charge $7 (ie. JaBistro) per piece so I definitely think this was worth it.  Sashimi platters - they do not have any platters but rather set dinner instead. Though on the pricier end, I feel that I can go to other places that specialize in the sashimi cuts (ie. JaBistro) than to come here for it instead - and like said, it is pricy as well.  My opinion is that if you love botan ebi like I - this would be the best place to go. A lot of people also come here for the Japanese style hotpot but for sashimi type - I would reckon to go to JaBistro instead."}
{"text":"Steady as a rock. Uni special, also deep fried crab. Cold sake traditionally served , smooth and floral.Tongue and chicken hearts salty and wonderful Muted polite service can morph into sophisticated guidance( familiarity can bring more than contempt)"}
{"text":"Overall I had a great experience at Ematei. I came in for Friday dinner and thank goodness my party got reservation beforehand, because when I arrived at 6:30pm for our table there were already tons of people waiting at the door for a seat.  Environment: The restaurant is located on St. Patrick street, which is a small street in between Queen and Dundas. It kinda felt like a small alleyway.  The restaurant itself is fairly large and has a nice Japanese vibe to it, with colourful paintings and decor on the wall. There are some private tatami rooms for large groups, and I'm fairly certain you have to call ahead to reserve these type of rooms. In the tatami room you're supposed to take off your shoes and sit on a cushion on the tatami covered floor.   We didn't get a tatami room for my group, but instead we got a large table outside for our group of 10. I think the table can actually fit a lot more people, possibly up to 15, as we didn't fill up the seats on the other end. Though my problem was that there was a random hollowed out space in the middle of the table that didn't seem to serve any purpose, which made the table wider than it should, thus making talking to the person on the other side more difficult.   Food: My friends recommended the hot pot at Ematei, but since none of the people I went with wanted to share one, I ended up getting their Nabeyaki Udon, which I guess had similar ingredients of the hot pot. The soup was very flavourful and I really liked the udon. The bowl tasted very authentic, similar to the udon noodle bowl that I tasted in Japan. I liked how smooth and chewy the udon noodles were, which was significantly different than the stuff you get at the supermarket. Meats wise there were very much of it, even though there was a lot of variety, but I still got full from my meal since I'm a small person, but I don't think many people will feel completely full from just getting the Nabeyaki Udon.  I did not try any other dishes so I can't comment on those, but just seeing the stuff that my friends got it seems that the portions are quite small here, given that the price is slightly higher than other Japanese restaurants nearby on Dundas West and Queen West.   Service:  I find that most of the servers at Ematei were Japanese/had Japanese background during my visit. This isn't necessary a bad thing because the servers were very nice and very attentive to our requests. However, I did find that the language barrier made it difficult to communicate with them sometimes, as their English wasn't very good. It was difficult to understand what they were saying and they had difficulties understand us as well. I feel bad saying this, because they were genuinely nice people, but to me I'd just rather be getting average service from people that I can communicate with better :/"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant and its decor. I think its a gem.  They have lunch specials on display as you walk in past the bar. Specials change periodically and range from $8 to $12.  My last visit, we were seated in a rectangular wooden table with an opening in the middle. Waitress explained in Japan they put sand inside and charcoal to light a fire. I thought it was cool!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the food was good. however, service was slow.  And waitress seems blind, can't see ppl rise hand"}
{"text":"Going for sushi with my boy M is like tradition now. We were looking for a new place to try and a friend recommended we check out Ematei. More of a Japanese izakaya than sushi place but it fit the bill.  It's a bit off the beaten path but easy to find. I like how the chefs counter is right at the front when you walk in and they of course greet you warmly.  We came on a Tuesday evening right after work so we had no trouble grabbing a table but by the time we left, the place was bumping. The inside is well decorated with Japanese traditional outfits, posters, maps and artwork along the walls.  Menu is massive, almost daunting with all the choices. A LOT of people were getting hot pot, which seems like a very popular choice here. If we had more people, I would have tried the sukiyaki ($80.00).  - Complimentary salad and soup - both were pretty standard fare but helped starve off the hunger pains while we waited for the main dishes.  - Gyu tan salad ($6.50) - the grilled beef tongue was excellent.  - Ikageso karaage ($7.00) - ikageso was probably our favourite dish. Perfectly battered, crispy, crunchy. Delightful.  - Yam tempura roll ($5.00) and spicy salmon roll ($6.50) - M's favourite rolls that he always orders whenever we go for sushi. Both were tasty!  - Enoki foil ($7.50) - shocking that they didn't try to make the foil into a swan shape.  Inside, there was imitation crab and lots of enoki. The sauce underneath was sweet (from the onions). This would have been perfect with some rice.  - Sashimi dinner ($28.00) - 15 pieces of sashimi; salmon, tuna, ebi, tako, yellowtail. I wasn't sure how the sashimi would be after reading some reviews but we were both satisfied with everything. The pieces were properly cut and everything tasted fresh.  - Wafu spare ribs ($10.00) - sticky, tender, moist.  Next time I'll pay closer attention to their daily specials (you see them when you first walk in). Everything was well executed and I'd be happy to come back again to try more things. Japanese hot pot nex"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Ematei is somewhat hidden on St. Patrick Street, but not enough to the point that it's a well known establishment that gets very busy during lunch hours.  I decided to try this place after looking around restaurants on Queen Street near my workplace. The outside is extremely traditional and reminds me of those Japanese houses from the feudal era. The inside looks more modern, and while the restaurant looks big...there's really not a lot of seating area.  You can see what the specials are as you wait in the waiting area, as they are displayed up front. Their specials are actually quite affordable and are among their popular items in the restaurant. I went with the daily special, which on the day I went consisted of 3 salmon sushi, 1 butterfish sushi, 1 imitation crab sushi, 6 tempura rolls, and 2 tempura makis.  Normally I criticize sushi restaurants that overdo on salmon sushi, but the salmon quality in this restaurant is actually better than many other restaurants I've been to. The other sushi pieces, however, were mediocre at best. The butterfish sushi was okay, but the imitation crab sushi fell apart too easily for my liking. The tempura rolls and makis were decent, although a bit soggy for my liking.  Service was good. Even though I sat by the sushi bar (away from the waitresses), the sushi chef was more than happy to take my order and get the bill for me once I was done.  I'd be interested to see how the specials vary in this place, but overall I wouldn't be quick in returning here as nothing really remarkable stood out."}
{"text":"We came here for sushi (our usual spot was closed) and maybe that was our mistake. Most tables appeared to be having hot food. We tried the spider roll, salmon cheese roll, negi Hamachi roll, spicy salmon roll, and spicy tuna roll. I'm not a big fan of spider roll but that was the best roll of the night. The salmon cheese roll was surprising as it was baked salmon and melted cheese but it's still not my cup of tea. The negi Hamachi was not memorable at all and the last two spicy rolls were pretty boring and basically just to the point. We tried the fruit pudding and it was not good. It tasted like fruity perfume flavor. And someone else at the table had the green tea ice cream which they said it was just okay. Luckily this was our second dinner because it would have been a sad first one."}
{"text":"Such an unassuming place!  Try the eggplant miso dish and the grilled squid and don't forget the ginger ice cream.  Great place to take the family"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 5 stars for food. Hands down the best Japanese food in Toronto. I needed to give this place justice because I saw there are a few reviews that rated this place horribly. Every restaurant has bad dishes and those reviewer just don't know how to order well at authentic Japanese restaurants.   This place is basically my boyfriend and I's cafeteria. We always come here for their lunch special (only available on weekdays) maximum you will spend $15. I recommend their chicken katsu curry (lunch menu), Udon (Tuesday today's special), and all their sushi specials, today's specials  (curry beef stew especially) Combination specials are good if you like fried Japanese food like karage (fried chicken) and tempera.  During dinner there are a few must orders:   - Seafood hotpot - comes with jumbo Shirmp, chicken balls, udon, other seafood that I don't remember and vegetables in a heavenly delicious broth! - Sukiyaki (Japanese hotpot) - comes with raw thinly sliced beef, and a huge variety of vegetables. So good!  The hotpots are pretty pricey around $60 but it can serve up to maybe 4-5 people.   - bbq pork fried rice (soo delicious. so much better than Chinese fried rice!)  - yellow tail sea salt seasoning  (there are two options. Not the neck one. The normal one) - California Roll. This may seem typical sushi but Ematei's California roll will blow you away. You will never eat another shitty California roll from anywhere else. This California roll has caviar is just rightly salted and as combines with the shredded cucumber, crab stick, rice and seaweed it is just and orgasm in your mouth. LOL maybe it's just me but the taste was pretty awesome.    Okay, there are bad things too. Sometimes you have a wait a little while for dinner because they are packed on weekends. And sooo sad that they are not opened for lunch on weekends. In conclusion, love this place, favourite restaurant in Toronto, and I recommend this place to all the Japanese cuisine lovers!"}
{"text":"This is a traditional Japanese Restaurant. I enjoy certain items that most people stray away from such as tongue and chicken hearts, which are cooked to perfection. There sushi is very fresh. The Junmai Kimoto cold sake is a nice a compliment to my meal on a hot summer day.  I recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"The Salmon used in the salmon teriyaki was dry garbage! Which Japanese restaurant serves potato salad with salmon teriyaki? Senseless Ematei, of course! Customer service does not exist here. The waitress does not know which fish is used in the sushi specials! I would gladly give minus stars if possible. Avoid this craphole!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously Japanese. Felt like I was transported back to Japan with the atmosphere.  They have an extensive menu including everything from Japanese curry and donburi to ochazuke to sukyaki. Of course they have the usual fare of noodles, sushi and tempura, too.   I think anyone who spent some time in Japan would feel right at home at this place. They even have an extensive menu of sake - though you only seem to be able to purchase cold sake by the bottle.   Worth a shot. I'll be back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Only tried sukiyaki(hotpot) and tempura and I have to say I am a little bit disappointed. Not as fresh as I imagined."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the sushi/sashimi here for a while so I can't comment on that yet.  The other kitchen food (bento boxes, donburi, udon, etc.) is much better than what you'd get at an average Japanese restaurant, but it's a bit more expensive as well so it balances out.  The hot pot here is fantastic, I would've given this place four stars for that alone.  The establishment is quite spacious and is family-friendly (in case you have a baby stroller or something)."}
{"text":"This place was okay in my opinion.  Not some place I'd rush to again, but it was decent.  I ordered the Una Don (grilled eel on a bed of rice) because it is one of my favorites and an excellent yardstick by which to judge a Japanese restaurant and here it was pretty bad.  But it might not be their focus...I mean they may specialize in the snacks and not care if their meals are lower than ordinary.  They also didn't have but one kind of tea - \"green tea\"  - and the waitress didn't know anything about it (although the menu also had oolong and I don't know why she didn't mention that when I asked what kinds of tea they had).  The atmosphere was good and if I wanted to kick back some umeshu with some homesick Japanese pals then this is probably where I'd go instead of the trendy and no better quality sushi joints that dot along this part of Queen St."}

{"text":"Ematei is one of very few authentic Japanese restaurants in Toronto. They are located under an apartment building and the interior is authentic as well.  I have mixed reviews with the food here.  First off, Sushi/Sashimi here is not that great. For a mid-to-highend restaurant (as they are fairly pricey), their fish is mediocre. However things take a turn when you order from the kitchen (not from the sushi bar). Like Teriyaki, Don buri, Don katsu, shabu shabu are all very authentic and tasty.   Their lunch menus are the best value though, they have this 'combination' where you get some tempura + teriyaki + rice for $8.50 and it's just what I want.  I would take my gf out on a date here."}
{"text":"i can think of better individual places for sushi, ramen, onigiri, grilled fish (shioyaki), etc., but ematei does everything quite competently and the prices were reasonable (i went for lunch).  i'd choose this place over a chinese/korean-run japanese place any day.  the service was fast and friendly and from my experiences in japan, the atmosphere was authentic."}
{"text":"We were looking to find a great Sushi spot near Queen street and did a  quick search and saw that this spot  was ranked high on both TA and Yelp. We were expecting to be wowed ...and to find a new spot to add to our on going hunt for good sushi in the downtown core. We did a walk in on a Sunday night at 7 p.m without any issues.  Sadly I didn't read through the reviews, had I done so  I would have realized that this a spot for cooked food and not sushi and sashmi.  The rolls were were tiny, with not much flavour. The sashimi was mediocre and definitely the smallest slices we've encountered anywhere. Our group of 5  adults and one baby left the place highly unsatisfied. They are baby and pram friendly but try not to sit near the entrance to the bathroom as a slight pee odour permeates throughout that end. Service while cordial was not friendly and was extremely slow. They did provide a high chair for us though, with a smile.  Cost wise we found it to be pricey for what we got. The $30 bento box for one person did not have much at all ( we would have preferred to pay $25 for an all you can eat at Sushi D). 6 pieces of maki (very tiny ones ) were $10 and the thin sashimi slices  were $12.  Sake was cheap at $4 for 6 oz. For the total cost you would get a better experience and fresher fish at Ki."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant. It has a wide selection but can be a bit pricey (~$15). But they do have a daily special for each day of the week (mon-fri). The restaurant design is looks really authentic too."}
{"text":"Ematei is a restaurant that I have been going to ever since I can remember. This restaurant tucked away under an apartment/office building is an unassuming Japanese restaurant that really can deliver. My main problem is when I see a group of people go into this restaurant and order the sushi, this is not what Ematei means to me. Ematei is an izakaya restaurant meaning that you go there for COOKED FOOD, this is what is good there. When I go to Ematei I have a couple staples that I have to get, the Sukiyaki, which needs to be shared and the Unagi don which I would debate is one of the best in Toronto. This fairly priced restaurant is the perfect place to visit when you are really hungry but don't want to drain your bank account. Now remember get the cooked food, dishes like their soba, ramen, katsu, etc all of these are their specialty. I have always loved Ematei and will continue to return to this cozy izakaya any time I get a chance."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Location is convenient & easy to get to. The décor is pretty boring compared to some of the more modern Japanese cuisine restaurants downtown. But it's a nice, quiet spot. No standing in line for three hours at this place! Food is a bit pricey, but I don't mind that once in a while since the quality is good. They do take out too, if you're not inclined to stay & eat.  P.S., I'm a non-drinker so I always answer not sure when asked if a place serves alcohol. *grin*"}
{"text":"Friend took me here that works nearby. He really likes the place and I can see why. Staff was very friendly. Food was very good. A little pricey but that is to be expected for the quality and downtown location.   The atmosphere felt very authentic. Really made you feel like you were in a little piece of Japan. I liked it."}
{"text":"I've walked by this restaurant a few times and I finally decided to try it after reading all the reviews. I was actually really excited to try this place after reading all the nice reviews. However, i was disappointed by the quality and taste of the foods.  My friend and I ordered curry chicken, sukiyaki don, fried croquette things and the dinner came with miso soup. Out of the items we tried, the miso soup was the best tasting of them all. my friend's curry was really watery and she wasn't too impressed. My sukiyaki don had a strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on , there was very little beef in the bowl and the vegetables weren't that great either. I really did not enjoy the taste of the sukiyaki don. The fried beef croquette were bland, but the oil was fresh and not too greasy. Overall, I really didn't think the meal was any better than a cheap stir fry meal that I could have gotten at a food court. Also, we received almost zero service. We had to wait a long time before getting the bill because the waiter was nearly not present. Maybe my opinion will change after trying or chanko nabe or some sushi dish? i'm not sure, maybe i'll check it out next time i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Authentic hot pot was tasty and great. On a cold night. E beef tongue was also especially good.   The physical space however needs a revamp, clearly they have been there for a long time but haven't updated anything throughout the years."}
{"text":"I probably should have read reviews before going here because I was totally taken by surprise of the lack of the \"usual\" Japanese cuisine. I have never heard of this izakaya.....now I have and I'm better for it.  Once you can wrap your head around this type of cuisine it is worth experiencing. I ordered some sort of box (which I thought would be a bento box), and there was nothing similar about it (not even the shape of the box). Inside I had this aspara-bacon, some black cod, a whole shrimp (why can't the heads be removed?), some vegetable (was it even a vegetable?), another fish (was it fish?) with some weird bone structure, and pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi.  Final assessment: Different and not regrettable. I for a while I felt like I was not in Toronto (maybe it was because there were no windows or natural light). I think people should give this a try if you are willing to think outside the bento box and experiment with the traditional type cuisine us Torontonians are not used to."}
{"text":"I don't think I really got the full Ematei experience because it was just the two of us and we just ordered a couple of Entrees and an appetizer, but the food from what I have tried was very good.  It wasn't very busy on a Wednesday night and the reservations we made wasn't necessary, but as the night got on, the place got busier.  For appetizer, we got the giant roll, which was, well giant. My friend got the tempura udon, which she say is her go-to food there. I got the suki-yaki don, which had all the things you would want in a sukiyaki but in a bowl with rice.   The price was reasonable, about $12 each for the three items we ordered.  The key about this place is that it's not your typical korean or chinese ran \"japanese\" restaurant. If you want go for a pure, unhyped japanese experience, go here. There's no one going \"BEST WHATEVER OMG\"--it's all all rolls, it's not all sashimi, it's not all japanese tapas--just good old authentic japanese dishes."}
{"text":"Ematei is a great traditional izakaya.  The place is authentic Japanese with a nice variety of menu options (from sashimi to yakitori to household food items).  It is my go-to Japanese spot when in town."}
{"text":"Ematei is one of the authentic Japanese restaurants. Compared to other Japanese places in Toronto, their strong points are Sushi and Fish-grill.   Matsu sushi set is classical sushi set where you can understand how one piece of fish is different from another, especially in texture---Forget about those Chinese/Korean sushi places with over-fabulous rolling and decos.  This is what good, authentic and safe (a real story) sushi should be.   My favourite hot dish is their cod fish dishes. The waitress told me they no longer serve grilled black cod fillet (gintara-yaki) (~$15), but you can try grilled black cod neck w/ radish (gintara kama daikon) ($7) instead. The portion is smaller, but the fish is samely good. My feel is that the raddish matches fish well.  If you are not sure what to eat, try bento box.  Their donburi and tempura are just so-so. Never tried their curry yet."}
{"text":"I had a katsu don. Overall, it tastes good. Sauce tastes perfect. Little too much rice though. I wish the chef would have put the egg on top of the rice around the fried pork just so that it'll keep it crispier. Thought too much juice/sauce at the bottom of bowl but considering the amount of rice, it's ok. (If you'd finish all the rice.) I would have given 5 stars if 1) less rice/juicy sauce, 2) crispier fried pork."}
{"text":"Worker drones of the area will be pleased there is a brighter food star amid this corner of Queen's onslaught of subs, burritos, and pitas.  Ematei is tucked away just up the block and is so inconspicuous that after three years of working next door I only noticed/tried it on a colleague's recommendation.  It seems plenty of other proletariat are in the know, because there can be a wait if you saunter in mid-lunch hour.  You'll pay more here than at Sushi Queen down the block, but the difference in quality more than compensates the marginal price difference.  The atmosphere feels authentic, and the staff are Japanese.  I stick to the sushi lunch with sashimi ($15), and the quality is always good--the sashimi is cut thick and is fresh, and the sushi is pre-loaded with wasabi like it is in good old Nippon.  Unlike many low- to mid-priced sushi places, they try to add a reasonable amount of sesame dressing on to the standard-issue iceberg wad that comes with the miso.    If it's a Friday (or an annoying day), I'll grab a pint of Sapporo to accompany the fishies.  The service is good but not over-friendly, and the ambience is dark but cozy--it's refreshing respite from fluorescent Microsoft Outlookery."}
{"text":"First off I lived in Japan for 5 years so the way I review Japanese restaurants, It's on a bit of a sliding scale. So believe me when I say that this is the most authentic Japanese experience I have had in the city! Starting with the fact that it's almost a hole in the wall that you have to hunt out with a map much like any place worth it's name in Japan. This is a very good start.   The Service: is super friendly, polite and the kind of helpful that i have only experienced in Japan. This is in no small part because most of the staff are direct from Japan, Students or working holiday visa and everyone speaks Japanese; as such this really solidifies that sense of even through your in the middle of Toronto you can feel that while at Ematei you are in Japan.   An example of this is while sitting down the waitress noticed my \"One Piece\" T-Shirt and we proceeded to talk about our mutual love for One Piece for the rest of the night,  all in Japanese by the way.  The Food:  As well is as Japanese as it gets. It may not appeal to some people who have never experienced \"Real Japanese food\" and may not be aware of the subtle flavors and textures that really make Japanese cuisine what it is. The Tempura is among the best i have ever had but the sushi is limited what you can get being a land locked city such as Toronto.   The only thing that's not very Japanese about this place is the price. Though not overly expensive is still far more that i would expect to pay in Japan. Thus i am quickly reminded that I am not in Japan in fact and that this is what you pay to get this kind of quality in Toronto.   I highly recommend going for lunch as they have reasonably priced lunch menu sets that would boost this place to well above 5 stars. But as such i will give this place an enthusiastic 4 stars! 4 and a 1/5 if i can."}
{"text":"We went to Ematei for dinner on saturday, it was an okay experience.  I think the restaurant has been overrated from the other yelp users.  But then my standard for Japanese restaurant is usually pretty high and maybe it is not fair to Ematei because I just have an amazing meal at Inakaya just the day before.  I thought the two were being compared from some of the reviews here, but now I can conclude Inakaya is definitely a much more authentic japanese restaurant then Inakaya.  You can get a much better deal at Inakaya, for example for the same $25 sushi combo, the selection of fish that I got from ematei are just mediocre stuff, nothing come out screaming.  However for the same price, you can get toro, unagi and really fresh hamachi from Inakaya.  Overall Ematei is just ok, I gave it a 2.5 due to the soso service that i have received."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant in Downtown Toronto has a great deal for lunch! Sushi special is $12.50. It includes 3 pieces of salmon nigiri, 1 piece of shrimp nigiri, a crab nigiri, a crab tempura cut roll, and 2 pieces of avocado cut rolls. Today's combination includes a trio of curry, shrimp & vegetable tempura, and pork katsu with a bowl of rice for only $8.50! I loved the combination a lot. For a cheap price, it doesn't come in cheap quality! It was delicious. Both the sushi special and combination come with a bowl of miso soup.  Due to its central location, parking at the meter is $3 per hour!"}
{"text":"This place serves authentic Japanese food. I've been there 4-5 times.  Ematei is kind of in between Izakaya and Ryotei style. Many small dishes like Eringi mushroom saute, grilled chicken, butter fried shiitake mushroom, tempura are good. Sukiyaki hotpot was also really delicious. Sushi, however, was good at a first visit, but wasn't afterwards. If I want to eat sushi, I'd definitely go to other restaurants that specialize in sushi. I'd say this place is good for sharing tapas or hotpots with others."}
{"text":"Great udon! Ordered the nabeyaki udon and the broth was very rich. It includes crab meat, enoki mushrooms, chicken, egg, tempura shrimps, scallop.   Definitely coming back for seconds. This place is authentic so if you want something like this then you need to come here.   Staff was nice and service was fast."}
{"text":"Hidden Japanese place that I would recommend getting a reservation for ahead of time. If not, make sure you WALK IN, and write your name down on the wait list.  We waited for an hour before getting seats on a weekday evening. The inside is quite large and you wouldn't expect that from the outside looking in. Food was average, I've had better Japanese food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Plan ahead. It's full.  Tempura Shrimp were some of the best I have had.  Delicate and yummy."}
{"text":"Very nice environment with a touch of old Japanese interior design. Felt at Japan while dining! It's a hidden gem that the front of the restaurant looks okay. The food was good. Tried Eel roll and Salmon Handroll. Must try I'd Salmon neck. Big portion but good price!!! Only $5.50. I will go back for that for sure"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to have lunch, and the staff were extremely rude. We were told to wait 20 minutes for a table and when we decided to do takeout instead, we were very rudely told to \"just wait\". Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"least favorable Japanese cuisine in the town. Two people had Japanese hot pot, sukiyaki. The ambient is more pleasant than the food. Sukiyaki is a little bit pricy for 70ish but more than enough for 2 people. The beef is 100% from Costco clearance sell.( super rubbery  after  1 min in the pot) mushrooms are dry and dull. The grilled chicken breast is a total disaster as it taste bitter."}
{"text":"True rating = 0 star. WORSE Japanese restaurant EVER!!!!!! I ordered grilled pacific salmon dinner for $19.50.  It came with rice, miso soup and salad. So, here's why i rated it 0 star: The salmon was dry and hard to dig into.  When i told the waitress that the fish was over cooked, her immediate response was a defiant \"NO!\"  I insisted that it was and would like a replacement, she went to the kitchen to consult with someone and came back saying that it's Pacific Salmon.  Unlike Atlantic salmon, it's harder.  I told her that i had lots of Pacific Salmon before and this issue is with the cooking, not the texture of the fish.  She then went away again and an older guy came to me.  I showed him how tough it was to cut into the fish and he told me that it's pacific sockeye salmon, and they are all like this and he walked away.  He didn't want to replace the salmon, nor did he offer for me to order something else that a decent restaurant would do for their customers.   Also the waitress didn't even bother to refill our empty cups with water. Poor attitude from the staff and poorly made food.   Terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"Came for sashimi, but promptly realised that all the tables around us were eating sukiyaki (Japanese hot pot). Guess we'll have to come back to try those!   ATMOSPHERE: It was quiet. Dark interior sets an intimate/romantic mood. Close to the hustle and bustle off downtown Toronto - so location is great.  SERVICE: Good service. No complaints here.  PRICE: Mid to high price for this type and quality of food.  FOOD: As I mentioned previously - I think we learned too late what they're known for. Oops! But for the raw fish, it was nothing impressive or fancy. No large variety of fish provided. For that price, we prefer sashimi from many other restaurants (Japango, Wow, Konnichiwa) much better.   We also had tempura appetiser and nabeyaki udon. Both were good. Worth their cost.  Overall, fair. But for this price point I expected better sashimi. Would be interested to give them another change, and try one of their sukiyaki sets in the future."}
{"text":"Four of us went on 2013-09-04 for dinner.  My Japanese friend recommended this restaurant.  We were not disappointed.  We order a few interesting dishes.  The food was excellent.  My uncle who was a chef said the food was good.  We ordered the Gyu Tan (beef tongue, $7.50), Gindara Kama Daikon (black cod neck, $7.00), Nabeyaki Udon ($13.50), Matsu Sushi dinner ($27.00), Nasudengaku (eggplant with sweet miso sauce, ($7.50) (our favourite), Una-Q Roll (BBQ eel, $6.00), Spicy Tuna Roll ($6.50).  We were very happy with all dishes. I would have never eaten a fish neck before but the it was worth the risk (our waitress recommended this dish when we asked for a recommendation).  Please have a look at my photos associated with this restaurant."}
