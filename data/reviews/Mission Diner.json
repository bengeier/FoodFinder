{"text":"Read the reviews and was a little nervous about give this place a try, but I am glad I did.  We had to wait a few minutes for a table but was acknowledged pretty soon after arriving, multiple times. Once seated our waitress was very attentive. Coffee was constantly filled, helped with modifying the menu item so we could get exactly what we wanted and checked once order arrived to make sure we were happy with our order.  It a diner and the food is decent diner faire. The service was exceptional. Got to say that I was impressed and will have to go back soon."}
{"text":"Have never been in here before but we were looking for a new place to grab breakfast and decided to give it a try. We came with a big stroller and everything that goes along with that. The lady working helped us through the door (strollers can be hard to maneuver) and told us to sit wherever was comfortable. The gentleman who was working suggested the back table in the corner \"because some mom's with babies sometimes like the privacy of that table.\" What an incredibly considerate person. (Thank you, by the way, for being so open and understanding of breastfeeding mothers. It's appreciated.)  After perusing the menu for all of 2 seconds I ordered the Blackstone Eggs Benedict on gluten free toast. It came in about 10 minutes.  This meal was glorious. It has avocado, bacon and BRIE! The coffee was delicious and service was just right. We will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Friggin' delicious food. Good coffee. Only downside is their manager insists on playing vaporwave.  Recommended for anyone who likes breakfast and slowed down Diana Ross songs."}
{"text":"Well here is the issue, the place, service and prices are adequate. The food was at least decent, menu was even mildly interesting for a breakfast kinda place. The issues were this, the ketchup on the table was rancid, which is pretty insane makes you wonder what else is going on there. On cue, was brought some rye toast with mold on it, yes mold. Full blown green colored mold on the crust, most disturbing with this is that the \"chef\" would of had to handle this bread and look at it several times before serving it. Sooooo it just makes you wonder what else is going on, once again trying to feed people literal garbage...that sucks"}
{"text":"My thoughts about the \"new\" Mission Diner are pretty much the same as the person who reviewed it in early February. Ate breakfast there for the first time today. Service was fine, prices were fine, portions were fine, but nothing was outstanding. I'm celiac so a lot of the menu items weren't an option for me, and as a result, I didn't look over the menu too closely....I'm sure others could order a more interesting breakfast than my standard 2 eggs with choice of meat, and hashbrowns. They gave me a good serving of nice fresh fruit instead of toast, which was very much appreciated, but otherwise, the breakfast was pretty unremarkable. The scrambled eggs weren't too greasy, which was nice, but the hashbrowns were overly so. My sausage was butterflied, so I don't think I got a whole sausage, but I appreciate that they use Spolumbo's because they're good quality and gluten-free.  Would I go back? Yeah, if I'm in the neighbourhood and craving a big breakfast, but I don't expect I'll go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"We went to mission diner on a whim before going grocery shopping. Needless to say they didn't disappoint. We thought it would be extremely busy considering it was a sunday and the last time we tried to go, you couldn't even get in to door. this time it wasn't busy at all so that made us happy.   We were greeted and told to sit wherever we like and our server was prompt and friendly. She asked us what we wanted for drinks, but failed to tell us what the daily specials were.He got a diet coke and I got a pomegranate mimosa,which was really good.   Food- He got a fondu sandwich, fancy name for grilled cheese. Good blend of cheeses and grilled perfectly.  I got a montreal benedict, basically a smoked salmon benny.Eggs and were poached perfectly however the hollandaise sauce made me a little weary because it was being to separate and become chunky. We both had the in house has browns, there were absolutely delicious!  We were even more entertained by the little blip on the back bottom of the menu. ( When you go, be sure to read it.)  We will definitely back."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here over the weekend, keen to try the \"Neuveux Nellies\"  In a word: decent.  I had the Blackforest Eggs Benny (ham, brie, avocado, whole wheat English muffin) and it was actually quite good. I don't usually stray too far from the classic eggs benny but this is probably one I could get used to.  The potatoes, however, are kinda, well, ew. Sorta stale, look crispy but aren't (I'm not even sure how that's possible) and oddly spiced. Since this particular dish is heavy already, I'd prefer to see fruit with the eggs benny rather than strange potatoes.  Overall, the coffee was fine, the service good, the price decent and my stray from the classic eggs benny did not go unrewarded.   I'll probably go back (sans potatoes).  T."}
{"text":"If your here for a hearty breakfast, try another place. Mission diner is good for people who eat like birds who have fat wallets.  Food quality was okay, but we will never go again."}
{"text":"Simply over priced and the food is average at best. With Reds just down the road you would think that would make them kick up there game but nope. Stick to the basics guys. Good service good food and fair prices. That's a diner. Learn from your competition. Sad cause you're only a block away."}
{"text":"If you are what you eat, then maybe I'll become the Yelp King of Calgary.     Normally a small place like this will either amaze or disappoint.   I would normally expect a 3 by 5 experience from a place like this but given that it was in the Mission district I had higher expectations of at least a 4 by 5.  Service was a clear 5 by 5. Food a 4 out of 5. Overall a 4.5 but minus 0.5 for reasons below.  I am glad they delivered on the expectations and my wife and I will be back for sure.  We were immediately greeted with a genuine and positive server who helped us to our table immediately.    He was by our table often enough that we never felt neglected.   I like to drink a lot during my meals so I almost always order two beverages to keep me going, because servers are only by enough to refill one drink.    Not here...  BOTH my water and coffee were kept topped up!   Meals came correctly and promptly.   Food was bang on.   I ordered the King's Breakfast which came with 2 eggs cooked how I like, 4 perogies, sausage, hash cubes and toast.  Everything was hot and cooked the way I like.     The downsides were cleanliness of the washroom, and a coffee stain on the table that needed a wipe.   The honey in the condiment tray had granulated but they made up for that with real actual Nutella.... YUM.  For these reasons I would take off a half point."}
{"text":"Great menu and service.  However, the meal was cold.  After I sent it back, half of it was still cold.  Cold and soggy english muffins - mmmm."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had the Mission breakfast - poached eggs on toast with avocado and sauteed mushrooms. Quite tasty, however I wish they'd use free run eggs - the yolks were only a light yellow and didn't have a great/organic flavour, so that was a bit of a turn off. Otherwise not bad."}
{"text":"'Nellies with Pearls'  Welcome to Mission Diner (good ridence to the nasty Nellies on 4th)  Not a lot has changed as far as the menu goes. You can still order a scramble or have your banana pancakes and the price has stayed the same. (low-reasonable) The positive new change is they have taken the 'nasty' out of this 4th street location. I didn't feel like I was eating at the mustard seed. The place is clean and a fresh coat of paint has gone along way.  For Breakfast I ordered 2 eggs, toast and sausage.  I had a couple concerns...   Where was the whole sausage? I recieved what looked like 75% of the butterflied sausage.  The breakfast also came with, what tasted like,  the passed down 'family secret' Nellies breakfast Potatos.... Yuck!  My friend had ordered the Eggs Benny and commented that the sauce was quite good (above average)   Pros:  Location Clean (you don't smell wierd when you leave)  Cons:  Service  Potatos   All in All this place is great if your in the area, but hasn't left me craving to come back."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this a higher rating -  but unfortunately I couldnt look past some things.  So first lets start with the good.  The food. I have been there 3 times and the food has been consistently good. As a vegetarian, I appreciate a tofu scramble on the menu, and they make a good one.  The portions are plentiful and the food feels homey and comforting.  I havent  had the coffee, but the price per cup is $3.75. Too much, considering the food prices are not exactly a bargain. It may be bottomless coffee, but come on folks...  Ok, here is the primary reason I havent been thrilled with the place.  Everytime I have been in there the table has been dirty, the condiment bottles dirty and the service frantic.  I know that it is a busy place on the weekends, but the manic nature of the servers can be a bit much. The restaurant itself has packed alot of tables into a small space, and while I understand it from a business perspective, it can feel cramped. Its not uncommon to have a servers bum in your face while standing at the table beside you.   Ive lived in Mission for a few years now, and while I love the convenience of this quaint neighbourhood I hate the pretension.  Hipsters, laptop users, people talking on phones loudly, blah blah blah, you see them all at this restaurant. I will go here again, but not on the weekend."}
{"text":"Small-yet-busy, Mission Diner offers up classic favourites and modern flavors at a reasonable price.   The outside isn't much to look at, and the inside is pretty plain too, but the food and the service are next level. My boyfriend and I dropped in on Christmas Eve for lunch, and were surprised by how busy it was for a day when the streets were so crowded.   I opted for the Mushroom Swiss burger with a cream of celery soup. Both were fantastic, and the homemade soup was hearty and hot: perfect for a cool day. Our server was friendly and totally on top of things, and the coffee cups never got a chance to empty. The Blackstone Benny that my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic (recommended by our server) and I didn't even get a taste...he devoured the whole plate.   Great experience overall, and I'll be back again soon, and with more friends next time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this past Thursday and it was excellent!  The service was fantastic and the food was even better, the best breakfast I have had in Calgary.    I had the veggie omelette and it was loaded with vegetables, and my cohort had chocolate chip pancakes which he was equally impressed with.  My partner and I generally go for brunch every Sunday however we are planning to go here tomorrow instead.  To top it all off the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We sat in the wrong section; there are only two waitresses and we got the bad (new?) one -- we watched as she brought the wrong food out to three tables. The wait from the time we placed our order was over 30 minutes and the restaurant wasn't full. Ben loved the pancakes, I had the breakfast BLT and, strangely enough, it was lacking in flavor and the toast was borderline burnt. Not an awful experience, but I wouldn't recommend it (there are much more reliable brekkie options in YYC)."}
{"text":"I am sadly disappointed with Mission Diner. I live in the area and am kind of obsessed with breakfast, so this may be a harsher review than it needs to be. But five stars, people? This 'aint!  To start, the coffee (which was steep at $3.75) was awful. Bitter and stale, I asked for another cup and was brought the same stuff. I thought it might've just been a bad swig at the bottom of the pot, but it was not, I'm afraid to report.   The service was the same as it was at Nellies (the restaurant that it replaced) - casual and cheery, but now with the new paint job and phoney attempt to \"clean up\" the joint, it felt insincere and awkward. I also noticed the same kitchen staff populated the place from the old Nellies (which is fine, I liked Nellie's despite their press-exaggerated health-code issues) but odd.   The food arrived and it was sub-par. The menu was extensive, but nothing struck me as super appetizing. Their omelette options were either unoriginal or perhaps a bit over-priced. I got the Tex Mex Chilie omelette in the end and wasn't overly excited or disappointed in it. I give the omelette about a 5.   My pal got a fruit bowl and asked for no cantaloupe, but she got cantaloupe in there somewhere.  Overall, I don't think I'll go back there unless I've got a serious omlette craving and am too lazy to walk the extra 5 blocks to Nellie's Cosmic Cafe on 17th Av & 9th. (Don't judge me, it happens.)"}
{"text":"It was really packed when we went on a Saturday afternoon during stampede.    The mission breakfast was great, avocado and mushroom Benny on marble rye.    Also the bacon Caesars were awesome.    The service was slow, but understandable.  What was really great was the owner bought our breakfast because it was slow and that was super nice she noticed that and did that for us.    Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars! Nearly perfect!  We were surprised to be seated straight away as this was Sunday Brunch-ish, and everywhere else had line-ups out the door.  We had fast, über friendly service. I ordered the eggs Benny with bacon, brie, and avocado. The server noticed it was sans bacon before I realized it, and whisked off the kitchen to remedy the situation. It was delicious and different, which I appreciate. My bf had the King's brekky, with perogies! Yum. Perogies with sausage, eggs, hash browns and toast. It was choice!  It's minus a half star for missing my bacon during assembly, and the fact that the table next to us came after us, and received their order before us. I was a little miffed as I was starving!  Our server/manager also hooked us up with our coffees to go! I thought this was brilliant, not only because we were about to saunter down the street, but because it also frees up our table for another patron. Excellent idea.   The manager was super bubbly and friendly. She chatted up most tables  and made us smile!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mission Breakfast. Great portion for a great value. Coffee was great, not bitter. Went at 11am on a Sunday, and lucky enough to get a table right away.  Service was fast and attentive. Will go back again to try other things on the menu."}
