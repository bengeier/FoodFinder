{"text":"Stale decor, its like a cafateria bar! Bartenders are rude, machines are tight and food over priced! No good feel place here, dont go!!"}
{"text":"Good to see a decent restaurant in this location where the old Cavalier was. Friendly service and adequate menu. We each had a meatball sub which was excellent. Strong recommendation if you're looking for three-star food at two-star prices."}
{"text":"Checked this place out a couple of nights ago...wasn't impressed...it's a weird bar looks like they don't get much business the bartender was rude & uninviting food is overpriced i'd rather go to mr Gs across the street..at least their bartenders don't alienate their customers.."}
{"text":"Love this Bar.  Rob is a constant professional and we go out of our way to come up here just to see him.   The drinks are good.   The only thing that they need is Food.  Again Rob, Rob.  Come see Rob."}
{"text":"This place used to be The Cavalier and it was empty for a while. Happy to see it open again. Stopped in on 7-5-15 the staff was pleasant and the drink prices were good. 2$ for a cold pint of Old Vegas Tavern Lager ( Might have been Pabst or High Life ) Video poker machines are good didn't win but didn't lose my money instantly. The decor is really nice with pictures of classic Las Vegas entertainers and places. I will definitely be back to try the restaurant. The old Cavalier had great food until the smoking ban made them shut the restaurant. I hope the Old Vegas Tavern can come close to it."}
{"text":"Had chilli dog and got food poisoning. Sick for 3 days"}
{"text":"Terrible service  Inattentive staff Slow food service  Broken machine  Staff refused to give owners phone number to tell him how they are killing his business"}
{"text":"Played some keno here last night.Machines are tight.Bartender was pleasant enough.Didnt ask us to sign up for anything.No big deal.They did  a real nice job on the remodel.We might come back to try the food."}
{"text":"They just opened yesterday. So far so good!! The bartender was super friendly and the beer was cold (so were the machines) but hey...they just opened. :D  This bar used to be the old Cavalier. Since they remodeled it, its super clean with a contemporary flair. Lots of super cool old Las Vegas pictures on the walls. The kitchen wasn't open yet but we will definitely be back to try it out!! The train that goes around the ceiling of the bar is pretty cool. Welcome to the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Have been exploring my new neighborhood for good food, drinks and cigar friendly establishments.  Found this place and came in for lunch. They don't have food until 4pm but everything else was great. Bartender was great, beer was cold and love the memorabilia on the walls. Guessing the food will be great, I'll be back."}
{"text":"OK so let's start here. Soon as I walked in I was greeted by two very nice people. Then I seen the lounge area to dine in and I was very impressed. If you wanted to take a nice girl out to a bar have a drink and maybe eat this place by far best bar food ever. The fries were fucking sooooooo good I'm still licking my fingers. The onion ring are fucking a trip! Perfect cooked. Where the onion doesn't slide out. Well done great job. I got some short stack ribs and I need not say anything. But this place is by far the best bar food dine in experience and food quality you can imagine. I will be here very often my new to go to place. Fantastic place!!!!!!!! Servers great!!!!! Bar tender great!!!!!! :))))"}

The train going around n the bar was pretty cool ad well we will definitely  be coming  back . Thanks again Rob for being awesome ."}
{"text":"Kaitlin (spelling?) out bartender is awesome. Drinks reasonably priced. Appreciate the free food on football nights and free shots with PATRIOTS touchdowns.   Why only four stars? Please for the love of all that is good in this world, make that damn toy train stop squeaking. I almost climbed on a chair to dismantle it myself. I have been here 90 minutes and it's only halftime. I am not entirely certain I won't take it down before I leave. Please make it stop. Please."}
{"text":"Great local. Bar and food and awesome service as well as loose machines and good decor this area of town badly. Needed this"}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Super Bowl. It's a Patriots fan bar. Cheap drinks and they had a free buffet at half time. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place got Chad in the kitchen now the food is amazing you got to come down and see Kim during the day Lindsay and the evening Scotty at midnight all the way to 8 a.m. I love the wings tossed in a little mild so good make sure you come down and see Michelle also Keno is popping"}
{"text":"I've never been in here til tonight. 3 ladies were leaving all smiles, I walked in the place was dead. there was a man near the door. another guy at the end,and a couple. I said to the blonde bartender is there poker she said tomorrow,,,,i asked her for a menu she rudely placed it at the end of the bar,and I said i'll take it over here I\"m gonna play keno. she asked me what would I like to drink, I told her iced tea. She copped a attitude and rolled her eyes at me. she came back with the glass dumped it said the tea was bad what else would you like. coke!!! I also asked for a philly steak to eat here one to go. No salt on the fries. The cook came out very politely asked if I needed anything else. when he left I asked her if I could get a tray napkins and silver ware. when you order food I don't think it should be asked, it should just be given out of customer service. Than I paid. this whole time all she did was play on her phone and didn't give a ratz ass who was there and what they wanted. she stated she just came back,and I told her why. you shouldn't have came back to your job your a f*** B***,and that is being lightly!!!! I see why the place is DEAD with no Customers!!!! She is probably part of the problem. so if you are the owner seeing this you need to check your bar out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to say this straight out, with one small change this place would be a 5 star, no doubt in my mind.  Okay, so this used to be the Cavalier, it closed a while back, sat empty for a while, then was bought and remodeled. I used to like the Cavalier, it was old Vegas, the food was good, the prices not bad, but it was badly in need of an update and I guess the previous owners didn't have or want to put the money into it.  Anyways, that's the history lesson, as we live close by I figured it was time to give this place a visit, as there were only 2 previous reviews I went in with a pretty open mind.  I like the remodel, nice and clean, i'm not sure the name matches the look of the place, but hey it's a name, who cares.  The food  The wife ordered a Caesars salad and meatball sub, I went with the short rib, heck if a place is going to be brave enough to put it on a new menu, let's see if they can fall flat on their faces.....  They didn't, oh boy they didn't, seriously, it's good, no that's an understatement, I would put the short rib up against any in town, the chef (who was the chef at Portofino inside the Desert Inn) can cook, oh boy he can cook.  The meatballs were excellent, the salad was great, but those short ribs, dear lord, if you like short ribs, get in your car and get over here.  The one negative, if you've read my reviews, you know by now I HATE US foods/Sysco products, well I ordered french fries with the short ribs just to see, and yeah, they are US Foods frozen crap, a chef with this obvious talent should be able to put out home made french fries, if not for that this place would get a 5 star review from me, the service was excellent, the food great, this is another place that deserves the support of the Yelp community."}
{"text":"Totally cool little bar.   10 min from downtown....tons of parking and Caitlyn pours a cold yummy drink and is s totally funny chick...check it out for keno and drinks !!!"}
{"text":"I came here because I heard stripchezze was serving food at the bar, couldn't believe what I was hearing so I had to come down and see what it was about. Turns out the place is awesome and the biggest plus of the entire thing, you can get the same yummy food sitting at the bar as you would hunting their food truck down!!! Winning!!! Staff is friendly, great drink prices and as always the stripchezze food is mind blowing and the girls are super fun and nice. So happy that this exists. Definitely won themselves a new regular. Five stars!"}
