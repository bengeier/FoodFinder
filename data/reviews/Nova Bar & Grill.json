{"text":"We ate here one of the first weeks it was open, and it was fantastic!  Our party had a mixture of food, and nothing fell short of being delicious and unique.    The menu has several different options, so if you don't think you would like Argentinean food, there are other \"Americanize\" options.  I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for something new and different."}
{"text":"ATe here last night on the patio.. it was nice people watching too. The food could have use a little more flavor but the staff were really nice and the inside was fab!! The empanadas were great really great"}
{"text":"Excellent food from an Argentinian run group. Authentic. The contemporary atmosphere is quite nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!    When I first entered I got more of a nightclub type feel, so I decided to take my chances. I'm so happy I did. The service was fast and the waiter was very attentive.   I didn't order drinks but I was tempted to order the \"Argentini\". I did however order the Churasco. The price was extremely reasonable; and when the waiter came out with the plate I was very pleasantly surprised. The steak was incredible. A huge portion and was cooked to perfection. I couldn't eat the whole thing.   If I'm ever in Cleveland - I would definitely go. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, everyone I encountered was extremely friendly. The food is wonderful...especially the empanadas :D   Check out their happy hour as well - great drinks for great prices !"}
{"text":"Ok so I went here for the first time on Saturday night, had a Tequila Sunrise and it was very good, its not like other places on W6th that dilute your drink and all you taste is the juice. Friendly prompt service, relaxing atmosphere and great music. I will definitely be coming back to try out the food."}
{"text":"This was my first but definitely not my last visit to Nova.  It has a very fresh upbeat atmosphere with great decor.  the empanadas are the best I've tried with the perfect shape and consistency, a crunchy NOT oily outside with a delicious filling of your choice of chicken, beef, or spinach (my fav)! the menu is actually a great variety of food with not only Argentinian fare but also Mediterranean inspired foods as well. Overall I loved this place and felt extremely welcomed by the owner and employees.  I wasn't planning on dessert until I saw \"the cake\"  This had to be the most delicious cake I've ever had.    I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Fun new restaurant on W. 6th street, next to XO but with tastier food and much much better prices and acoustics. Friendly, while still inexperienced, servers and a modern atmosphere that still manages to feel cozy due to low lighting. The empanada appetizer is a must have and only $6. The pastry is light and crispy and the filling is a tasty mixture of either chicken, spinach or beef with a traditional Argentinean mix of herbs. We tried the chicken and the spinach versions. The chicken was our favorite. Delicious! The Nova Picada appetizer was a disappointment. A handful of bland cheese cubes tasted store-bought, next to OK salami, cured bacon and 3 toasted slices of baguette, was not worth the $10. Skip that one. For entrees, we tried the Florida snapper and the grilled skirt steak entrees, each under $20. Both were cooked perfectly and served with either mashed potatoes (Mmmm garlic) or deliciously seasoned fries and a side of tasty vegetables. Marta, the Argentinean owner-chef came out to greet us. She was as humble and charming as the food itself. Nova is definitely worth trying. The menu could be more bold, in fact we wish they would be more adventurous with the combinations, but the food was overall delicious and the prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Definitely more nightclub than restaurant.  Good empanadas.  Grilled chicken pizza was not good.  Rubbery crust, the chicken wasn't grilled (more like poached which I don't like), and lackluster \"queso fresco.\"  And if you don't like red pepper flakes don't order it.  Bar service from Natalie was the saving grace of the experience!"}
{"text":"I brought a buddy here to watch the Cavs game one night, and enjoyed myself.  We ordered the wings and a pizza to split. They advertise \"unique\" wings, and they are different, I thought they were a little too salty for my taste, but my buddy loved them. They have some sort of dry rub on them. Interesting part is that they came in all different sizes...with one wing being as small as my thumb! The pizza we got was the cured meat one. I really loved the pizza. It wasn't like any other pizza in the area, and the cured meats were a welcome addition. Overall, the food was good, but for two guys, the quantity was a little smaller than what we expected.  I didn't order anything special other than a dortmunder, and my buddy just drank bud light so I cannot say much about the drink menu.  The real highlights here were the service and atmosphere. The bar definitely had a euro feel to it, and they played techno/dub step/trance music. Service was fantastic, bartenders were very nice, and our food was delivered promptly."}
{"text":"Service was great, I mean really great. Attentive and really acted as though they cared about us being there. Menus was solid, a solid good and great combined. Wine menu was Argentinian reds and whites, and beers on tap (according to my date) were perfect...a fab selection of ales. We both had steak...Argentinian style, and it was perfectly made, and I won't even mention the carrots that were delicately mixed with fresh garlic. Mouth watering.  This is def. a place for a fun date and/or a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"So so good!! The decor is minimal, but contemporary.  It's not the best atmosphere, but the service and food definitely make up for it.  The service is fast and attentive. The bartenders always make sure that your drinks full.   Their happy hour is such a good deal with $2.00 drafts and discounted appetizers. Their Argentini martini is pretty good- slightly sweet, but not overwhelming with plenty of liquor.  Additionally, they have a fairly large selection of drinks and beers on tap for a small bar.    I LOVE their grilled Argentine chicken wings and chicken empanadas.  We literally had 1 order of Argentine chicken wings and 3 orders of chicken empanadas during the course of 1.5 hrs.  The empanadas were melt in your mouth delicious, especially with the mayo sauce that comes with it.  The chicken wings are crispy with a light bite/heat to them, especially with the blu cheese sauce.    I'm excited for the next happy hour visit and to actually try their regular food, stay tuned for an update!! :)"}
{"text":"Saw great reviews and decided to check it out.  Maybe it was all the good ratings that made us believe we would have a wonderful experience but it was less then adequate.  There was nothing on the wine list that matched what they had in stock.  They had no (zero) Malbec in stock and offered us a cab that turned out to be really awful (and I'm not a wine snob - I can drink everything from the best to a Walmart brand).  Food was just ok.  We had empanadas that were fine.  Shared  $30 plate of mostly meat (Parrillada ) that was just ok - low quality meat made a bit tasty but somewhat greasy.  Not sure if we just happened to order their worst stuff but I cannot give this anything higher then 2 stars.  I'm just glad I went there with my special someone and we made the best out of things.  Server was very accommodating and helpful."}
{"text":"Our dinner was amazing!!  It's brand new, and I was impressed with the food and service for being new.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great service, inviting atmosphere, and delicious food at reasonable prices....what more can you ask for?  Do yourself a favor and try this amazing gem of a restaurant...incredible!."}
{"text":"This place used to be called the west 6th grill and it sure cleaned up nice. It's a lounge so don't expect the typical crazy bar scene. Sit down, have a martini and chat. I went here on a Friday night so it's great to have something like this in the neighborhood if you ever just want to have a place to just chill without those crazy drunks around if you know what I mean.    The decor was really nice by the way. Neon pink and blue lights were the first things I saw by the bar area. It kinda looks like a place you can find in the bigger cities like New York. Later to find out, this also is an Argentinian restaurant during the day. So that's a must to try and heard their happy hour specials are great as well. Nice comfy sitting area in their dining area as well as the bar.   I'd come again to just chill or if you're looking for a place to pre-game, come here because they know how to make their martinis/drinks here!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The food is phenomenal. I've enjoyed Milanesa since I was a boy and aside from my mom's, it ws the best I've had. Potatoes and salad on the side were very good too as were the empanadas. Extremely impressed. The downsides are the motif. I don't know if it wants to be a club or a restaurant, judging by its decor. Drinks were good. And for some reason there's a video camera directly above you as you enter the men's room.. kinda strange."}
{"text":"This is a typical lounge except that it has great argentine food.  The Milanesa was great.  The chicken was good. I'm heading back for the more."}
{"text":"Nova is a great place for a late night diner or just hanging out with friends. The food is great and the service is fast and the appetizers was half off. On Wednesday night from 8pm until 11pm they have salsa classes with Roberto Barboza. Nova is my fav place for diner and meeting friends."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews, I was surprised Nova was not busier. We visited on a Thursday around 5:45 and were the only people there, so we got a great table on the patio, overlooking West 6th St. The best part of it all was that it was happy hour, meaning that all martinis were $6 (normally $7-9) and appetizers were half off. We were planning on getting drinks and appetizers anyway, so it was a great bonus. My martini and my bf's manhattan were excellent. We started with a sampler of the empanadas, which was one of each kind: spinach, beef, and chicken. Especially at the happy hour price of $3, these were amazing and are a must-have. The bf liked spinach best but I liked the chicken the best. For our main courses, I had a portobella grill sandwich and my bf had a steak. Both were excellent and were served with soft and flavorful pommes frites. The entrees were reasonably priced as well, $12 and $17 I believe. To say I would return is almost an understatement, as we returned the next day to grab another happy hour martini after having dinner nearby. The happy hour runs until 8, so don't miss that. Service was friendly. This is definitely the kind of place I would insist someone visit when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome place with very authentic Argentinian meals.  We had great service and I loved the atmosphere.  This may be the best restaurant in downtown Cleveland"}
