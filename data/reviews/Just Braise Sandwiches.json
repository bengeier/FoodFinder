{"text":"The right ingredients put together in yummy sandwiches on fresh buns. Fries are crispy and delish! Tucked away behind the new fortinos."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative food, friendly staff, reasonable prices. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup was flat and flavorless. Poutine was okay and kale salad was amazing. When asked if we liked the food we told them soup wasn't great. First girl didn't say anything. Second guy came and asked and he offered us another soup."}
{"text":"Overall Impressions: 4.0 stars and a welcome addition to North Oakville. Stopped by this new restaurant while visiting in town and I highly recommend trying it out. I know I'll be coming back next time I visit Oakville. I mostly frequent Asian joints in the GTA and this place lives up to the type of food I'm used to out there.   Food: I tried their pulled pork sandwich with a side of kale salad. The sandwich was delicious. The pork was tender and juicy. Coleslaw topping on the sandwich was crunchy, refreshing and overall the flavours mesh very well together. The bun was fresh and soft. It had a good meat to bun ratio. The kale salad had some nuts and raisins with a light citrus dressing. I liked how the salad wasn't drenched with dressing that was overpowered everything.  Service: The service was great. The cashier was welcoming and helpful with the menu and selection. It's a clean restaurant and nice inside. They have a handful of tables (seating 2-4) so probably not ideal for huge crowds. I see it being an ideal takeout spot. My friend and I ordered, grabbed a seat and we were served quickly within a few minutes. A few people (including the owner?) came by to ask if we were happy with the food. I enjoyed the vibe here!  Parking: It was easy to park in the large plaza space. There's plenty of parking around."}
{"text":"Calling all ex-Montrealers! Miss your poutine? Gotta try this place! Really really hits the spot! Fries kinda reminded us of \"Belle Provence\" just little less greasy. Great service, clean, quick and food bursting of flavours! Love them! Got a gift card for my friends right away!"}
{"text":"Great soups, sandwiches and poutine. Highly enthusiastic staff but prices were a bit steep. Perfect comfort food for a cold wintery day."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and my favourite sandwich spot in Oakville. Definitely a good time for a quick bite or working lunch. Their portion is just right and price is reasonable. Like it so much it is conveniently located close my home."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious!   I really liked the chicken karaage sandwich but not the kimchi poutine but that's just personal taste.   Otherwise, it's a really cool spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Unique flavours. Poutine with braised beef and beef Banh Mi are a must try. The ambiance is a bit out of touch with the food. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite quick lunch places in oakville right now. I had their fried chicken sandwich and the kimchi sandwich. Both were amazing with the right balance of spice and flavor. The bread is perfect as it doesn't get soggy but holds all the flavor for a perfect bite. If you try anything at all, try the tiramisu milkshake. Best. Milkshake. Ever.!!!  I'm addicted. I have dreams about that stuff."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are so good! Fries too!  Really cute place, super friendly staff and great quality ingredients. Nothing like this in Oakville. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Such a big fan of this place the first time around. Can't go wrong with the pho banh mi burger that's for sure. The just karaage order was good up until I dined in. The second time when I sat down to eat here, it seemed as if there wasn't enough fried chicken - only literally a handful of bites, and that already cost me $4.95... why did it seem so little for the cost the second time around, but when we got it to-go, the bag was filled. Not satisfied with the second visit because of that stale, and stingy experience. The first time around I also ordered the kim chi fries. Not a big fan of kim chi but decided to give it a go. It was definitely generous in terms of portion sizes so I will give them that.  I'd probably ask for the just karaage to go next time if I had known they wouldn't give so much in the dine-in experience. Willing to give this place another shot and order a milkshake."}
{"text":"Stopped last Friday on my way to the Ti-Cats game for the first time and am so glad I did. When I walked in, I was immediately taken care of and got a great explanation of the different items on the menu. On the advice of the girl behind the counter, I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich along with Kimchi BapÂ poutine. Absolutely phenomenal meal! The sandwich was huge with a solid roll that provides the base to hold all of the pulled pork and slaw goodness inside. The poutine was great with crispy fries paired with the spicy sauce. Can't wait to go back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 10 out of 5. They have exactly what I want.   Killer sandwiches, fresh cut nicely fried fries, and crazy thick MILKSHAKES!  There is so much thought put into every item, and it's all quality.   BEST SANDWICH PLACE IN THE GTA."}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5  An exciting sandwich experience unique to Oakville! I'm not typically a big fan of sandwiches (definitely not my go-to food) however, I really enjoyed the interesting menu options that Just Braise offers! Definitely an Asian-fusion sandwich place done right. Glad to have this option available close to home instead of trekking to downtown TO (and brave the horror of traffic and $$$ parking).   Taste: 4/5  The sandwich buns are DELICIOUS! I brought my family here to try and everyone commented on how crisp and interesting the sandwich bun tasted. We ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork and Pho Beef Banh Mi flavours - both were bursting with flavour and paired nicely with the sandwich. The beef and pork were braised perfectly, with the right amount of tender and juiciness. I preferred the Pho Beef a little bit more as I felt like the Pulled Pork was a little saltier. We also ordered a side of BBQ Poutine. I wasn't super impressed with this one as I felt like the flavours here didn't mesh as nicely and again, also too salty. Other than that, I'm still interested in trying out the rest of the items on the menu...not to mention their really cool milkshake menu!   Service: 4/5 Service is fairly quick and customer service is great. We grabbed a table ourselves after ordering and the food was delivered right to our table. I also asked for coriander on the side instead of paired into the sandwich and they were able to accommodate this - SCORE! They did make a small blunder in serving us regular poutine when I ordered the BBQ Poutine though. The chef (?) apologized when I informed him and corrected the order in a good amount of time (i.e before we finished the rest of our food). He also came by to check up on how everything tasted as well. Kudos to the Just Braise team for delivering an efficient and pleasant experience!   Ambience: 4/5 Decor is nice and modern with a good amount of seating space. It gives more of a quick dine and go feel.   Heads Up:  - Located in a large plaza with ample free parking  - Available for take-out!"}
{"text":"It's quite delightful that the choices for Banh mi sandwiches is getting better in Oakville.  Just Braise is a must try.  Sandwiches are served on a round kaiser style bun instead of the long sub type most commonly used.    The bun was fresh and had a interesting bubbled crisp outer shell.  We ordered the beef and fried chicken.  Both were excellent.  The spicy mayo on the fried chicken really made it POP.  As sides we had chicken soup and fries.    The fries are the best fries I have had since forever.  They reminded me of Five Guys fries but without all the oil.  The location is very cute and clean.  I did take out but would not hesitate to dine in.  Message to the owner..please please please get on skip the dishes or Uber eats."}
{"text":"We went there around 5pm on a week day. ordered kimchi beef sandwiches. The portion is too small for the price. The buns were stale. Hard to chew. Overall is pretty okay. Non-Asian people would probably be happy with it. But it definitely need some improvement on the flavour."}
{"text":"Great concept! The sandwiches were tasty. The bread (buns) was fresh, chewy and perfectly toasted. We ordered the banh mi and the karage with a side of poutine. The fries tasted funky and we wouldn't order them again. They sell cute, yummy treats too. Nice and modern decor. Small place but we were able to find a seat during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Joy. Joy. Joy.  I remember at summer camp growing up we were told to choose joy even when things weren't going so well. Well, thankfully coming here was a time that was really easy to choose joy!   On this particular day, joy came in the form of a Coffee and Cookies milkshake from this lovely place. I brought five of my high school boys I coach here. One of them eats kosher so I had to run across to the large grocery, Fortino's, across the street so I unfortunately didn't order a sandwich. When I got back from the grocery store my milkshake was ready. Wow. Yay. I'm not sure what else to say. This had to be the best milkshake I've had in a very long time. Their milkshake flavors are the best I've ever seen. They have one that is Tiramisu!   My boys all got the pulled pork which they loved. I saw on the menu they used kimchi in many of their sandwiches and it turns out they make their own kimchi in-house! How cool is that?! I ordered some of the kimchi to go and am actually eating it right now. I figured it would be fun to eat the kimchi while I wrote the review!  Also! I met the owner, who's name is also Patrick! He was beyond kind and it's clear that he runs the best business. The other woman who worked there, Sarah, was so nice and made our visit a lot of fun even though she to make a lot of milkshakes. I left with a huge smile on my face and an amazing milkshake.  I will definitely be back whenever I'm anywhere close to this place. Amazing! Thanks Patrick for the wonderful visit to your establishment! It was certainly easy to choose joy that day!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!! The best thing ever!  I've tried the pulled pork, pho, the fried chicken, and the poutine! Plus don't miss the ricotta balls!   I need one closer to me! Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Had the karaage sandwich today with poutine on the side, absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a full 5 stars and this place does deserve all stars because the sandwiches are bloody delicious and the service is quick and friendly.  I came here with a lot of high hopes and this place lived up to it.I ordered a Pho Beef Banh Mi sandwich which was so so so tasty.The bun is perfect and fresh so is the meat and the tops.I love the sauce used on it.But what got me a little thinking was this sandwich with tax is close to $9.I mean it's an expensive sandwich and definitely not too big.  Secondly I feel they need to add a kids menu on their menu I mean I don't want to spent $12/13 on a meal for a kid without a drink.They should introduce small sandwiches or maybe half sandwiches as a part of the kids menu.  Overall I loved what I ordered and I do look forward to coming here many times and trying their different signature sandwiches and poutine and sides.  I would love to congratulate the owner for brining this amazing concept in Oakville and kudos to the team for delivering such fresh and divine sandwiches."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Everything was made in-house and they give generous portions!   We ordered the pho beef banh mi, karaage, Kimchi Bap Poutine, and meatloaf taco sandwich. We enjoyed every bite and everything.   I will definitely be coming back. My new go-to sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 8/10 Drink: n/a Service: 9.5/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 8.5/10  I came here finally as it was one of the neighborhood places I had yet to try. It offers a bunch of Asian fusion sandwiches, something you don't find often (especially out in Oakville)  I ended up picking up the karaage sandwich to-go. Awesome flavours! I really enjoyed the flavours of the chicken and the toppings that came with it matched it perfectly. That being said I wasn't really a fan of the bread. The exterior of the bread was great but the inside of the was a little too soft personally and reminded me of plain white sandwich bread.   The service was great and very polite. They didn't leave us waiting long.   The decor is pretty sparse and could use a little more decoration. Also not what you'd expect from a sandwich shop, but it does make it feel like a place you could stop by and have a coffee and study/work.   Valuewise, it's reasonable compared to other alternatives like burrito or hamburger shops, but it offers something a little more unique.  I think this is a great place to stop by and have a sandwich and coffee, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop on my \"eat out\" rotation. I've tried many items with my favourites being the Kimchi Beef sandwich and Chicken Marinara sandwich that I go halvsies on along with the BBQ Poutine with added pulled pork. If I'm on my own I really enjoy the Pulled Pork sandwich. A note on the poutines... I like them as they are (have tried the BBQ, Kimchi and Brekky) but the BBQ and Kimchi poutines are more like loaded fries than a traditional poutine. No cheese or gravy. Personally, I like it better but then I'm not a gravy fan.   Bottom line: The buns are always fresh, the ingredients are delicious and if the food wasn't so good I would have room to try one of the amazing sounding milkshakes they offer. (So far I haven't been able to resist the savoury options). You won't regret visiting."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Oakville let alone anywhere north of Upper Middle but the city just doesn't attract true artisans and people looking to break free from the norm, luckily this small sandwich shop is just that.   It is by far one of the best sandwich shops west of Toronto, and by far the best in Oakville. Luckily for me it's close to my kids so I can stop in for a quick bite before or after seeing them.   Located in the Longos plaza the owner has taken what you expect a Canadian shop to have, chicken sandwich, pulled pork, and beef, along with some poutine but instead of leaving it boring as most places would do he has added an Asian and I would say Japanese twist to each of his menu options and made an amazing fusion that is full of flavour and deliciousness in each bite.   You have to try the Fried Chicken (Karaage) or the Beef + Kimchi along with Kimchi Bap poutine, don't forget to also have one of their amazing milkshakes I would say the Tiramisu one is to heaven, but you decide"}
{"text":"Finally got out to try this place today.    Was delicious!  My family of 4 tried 3 different kinds of sandwiches ( 2 of us had the Beef Kimchi)  plus bbq poutine.  All awesome.  And shakes were amazing.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. A real burst of personalized flavour in this part of franchise-heavy suburbia.   I went here with friends to a small and clean dig. The chalkboard menu and decor don't do enough to shine the sandwiches a bit better. I wish we had some music playing at our visit.   We all ordered different sandwiches, Karaage, and a poutine. My kimchi sandwich was delicious with just the right amount of the spicy cabbage. The meat fell apart. The bread, as bland as it looked, had a great rise and crust to it. The sandwich did get cold rather quickly though.   The karaage was okay. I would have liked a bit more seasoning (maybe something similar to a furikake taste) but really, fried chicken is life.   Our poutine was delicious with the right amount of gravy and cheese curds, but we were taken aback to find four hairs in it. The server apologized, made us a hairless, fresh poutine, and even complemented us with these amazing cookies fresh from the morning. The chocolate was so soft. Yum. That's service.   Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the sandwiches. You folks are doing it right."}
{"text":"So I went back sooner than I thought! LOL. This time I got the Karooge sandwich which was amazing! I did pay the extra to get double the meat, but I don't think I will next time as the sandwich was overflowing with the Karooge (a great thing but figured the original would be just enough meat as well)  I also had the ricotta donuts and they are just amazing! The taste kind of reminds me of funnel cake but times 10! The flavor is so good (especially for someone who isn't a dessert person)  And once again the customer service was great!  So glad I found this place! Sending all my coworkers there asap!      Just came across this place since its close by to work. Had the Pho Beef Banh Mi and a side of Karooge. The sandwich was so good, could have used some more beef (which you can get for an additional charge) but the flavors were amazing. The Karooge is pretty much fried chicken pieces and they were so delicious! If you get them as a side, they don't give many pieces, you could eat these as a meal if you order maybe 3-4 side orders but again they tasted so good and comes with a side of spicy mayo, I'll most likely get 2 orders of these next time.  Apparently they're ricotta donuts are supposed to be amazing! I will def have these next.  I also liked the fact that the employee came out of the back to hand deliver me my food. It was a nice touch to customer service.  Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 4.5/5 Decided to give Just Braise Sandwiches a try, since it's right in my neighbourhood. The menu items are asian-inspired and unique to Oakville. The Karaage Sandwich and Beef + Kimchi were very good. There were a lot of menu items that caught my eye, such as the Kimchi Bap Poutine and Tiramisu Milkshake, and I'll definitely be coming back to try them.  Food: 4/5 I ordered a Karaage Sandwich with a side of fries, and a Beef + Kimchi Sandwich with a side of Karaage (fried chicken bites), which came to about $25. Love having the option to order Karaage on the side with my sandwich, which was the same cost as a side order of fries.   Both sandwiches were very well balanced in flavour and texture, and the fries are fresh cut fries. However the Karaage Sandwich could use a few more pieces of chicken.  Service: 4/5 Very friendly service. I was having a hard time deciding what to have (because everything looked so appealing) and the girl taking my order was very patient with me.  Atmosphere: 5/5 The restaurant is quite small and seating is limited to about 15 seats. The inside has a modern-industrial look and is very clean. I arrived at around 12:30pm on a weekday, and there were only 4 other people inside, all of which were taking their meals to go.  Tips & Recommendations: -Karaage Sandwich highly recommended -Try the fresh cut fries! -Lots of parking available -Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious!! I've been a few times and I'll definitely be coming back!   I've tried the Pho Beef Banh Mi, Karaage, Texas Chili, Kimchi Bap, and Chicken Marinara sandwich. Everything tasted amazing, very flavourful. The portions are generous each time, I leave there happy and full.   I've also tried a few of their milkshakes. The Strawberry and Blueberry shortbread milkshakes are so yummy!! Also, so very filling! The shortbread is a nice touch. I've also tried the Oreoeoeo. I can't wait to try the others!  And lastly on their menu, the sweets. The mini brownies and fried ricotta donut bites are a must! Even if you're full from your meal, take it to go! You won't regret it!  The service here is excellent, quick and efficient. They bring the food to your table while you wait. The owner will also take the time to come out just to have a chat and to make sure you're well taken care of!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. We got the pho beef bahn mi sandwich, all day breakie poutine and beef + kimchi on kale instead of a bun. They had some yummy sounding milkshakes which we didn't get to try.  Will definitely need to go back again"}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we had here when staying at a hotel nearby for a night.   The poutine, our first ever was definitely the best of any we had during our trip.  The sandwiches had a lot of flavor and the children could.not get enough of the tiramisu milkshake."}
{"text":"Second time eating here in a week and I think we're hooked!   Karaage sandwich is amazing, and the Tiramisu milkshake is highly addictive.  Today I ate the Meatloaf Taco Nite and it was full of flavour and juicy.  Im definitely going back this week to try another sandwich.   Awesome food and service."}
{"text":"We tried the kimchi beef sandwich and the pho beef banh mi and both were delicious. Fries were excellent as well. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here from Richmond Hill with high hopes and this place lived up to it. This spot is clean with nice decor and two big washrooms. The menu is pretty simple but versatile with a lot of asian fusion options for the dishes. I ordered the Chicken Karaage and the BBQ Pulled Pork with a side of All Day Breaky Poutine.   Both sandwich's were delicious and tasted amazing, the buns were also freshly made. The All Day Breaky Poutine was literally the best thing ever. Eggs and sausages with fries have never tasted so good, it was a great combination!  There were so many other things on the menu that I would have liked to try out but I was way too full (their smoothies look awesome). I will for sure be back for more and I highly recommend everyone to try this place out if you happen to be in Oakville cause it is a great option."}
{"text":"For a small seating area, I was surprised it had 2 decent size washrooms. The place looked clean and modernized. Decided to check it out due to high ratings -again.   The menu is limited but at least one doesn't have to think long. Sandwich and a side will cost you $11.50.   The sandwich buns were crispy and interesting to bite into. A lot different than most of the bread out there. Too bad it's not whole wheat.   We ordered the beef and chicken one. Disappointment came in the braised beef stew which came practically cold. I had to ask them to heat it up. Unfortunately it wasn't even warm the second time. Really?? A soup is supposed to be hot no matter the season!! Sorry, but that's the honest truth.   Verdict: For the price, I could eat somewhere else and my tummy will be content."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw their sign advertising \"braised meat sandwiches\", and the wait did not disappoint! The pulled pork was succulent and tender, the karaage chicken was crispy and delicious, and their poutine is next level! I Honestly can't say enough good things about this place. Price is right too at 8$ a sandwich or 12 for a combo. Safe to say I'll be coming back often. They have an \"all day brekky\" poutine with sausage which sounds amazing as well."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing sandwich spot. Unique sandwiches for a ridiculously reasonable price. Here's the fried chicken sandwich I got called the Karange. It's delicious and I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The braised beef was excellent and was on a very fresh bun. I had the soup on the side and wished I had room for desert."}
