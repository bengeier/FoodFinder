{"text":"Located in the food court on the 2nd floor of the Pacific Mall. Very pedestrian food at restaurant prices. Sat at a sticky table in front of the establishment. The food was not good, in spite of the name. My daughter got an upset stomach and felt nauseous after drinking the soy milk that came with her food."}
{"text":"Came here for house special soup noodles today. The miserable woman served me. Usually, the food is good, so I'm willing to overlook her rudeness. But today's noodles were soft and I could cook them better at home.  So I will not be returning anymore, I can overlook her rudeness for good food but not for bad food."}
{"text":"Food court kiosk found on the second floor of the Pacific Mall. In the same area of Beard Papa. The foods are bland and the BBQ'd pork looked downright disgusting to my round eyes, although CUTE! Chinese Girl thought the more disgusting parts were delicious.  \"These huge BBQ'd pig veins are good for your skin.\"  Really?  Portions are large and each order came with soup and a cup of sweet soy milk."}
{"text":"I used to come to Good Taste Garden a lot for its congee breakfast specials.  Then it changed ownership.  Then the congee breakfast specials disappeared. Then I stopped buying from Good Taste Garden.  So this wonton noodle lunch was a re-acquaintance of a long lost friend.    The wonton noodle ($5.49) was expensive based on the competition nearby in Market Village.  It had 4 wontons and some vegetable.  It looked good in picture, but boy, the ingredients inside the wontons were going bad.  I could really tasted it.  If the food is not fresh for a Saturday lunch, probably the busiest meal of the week, I can't imagine the food quality of a dinner on Tuesday, easily the slowest meal of the week.    To be fair, the rice noodle was fresh and tasted acceptable.  I would walk to the wonton noodle store in Market Village to satisfy my craving next time."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but I always *try* to get a HK milk tea from this stall when I'm at Pac Mall.  The tea has a strong flavour and it's only $1.25!  Sometimes when you come too late in the day, it's no longer available 'cause they don't make any after they run out.  Despite not having dined here, I am quite surprised by its low rating 'cause it always seems hoppin'!  Their prime, corner real estate at the upstairs food court could also contribute to its busyness."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and ordered rice roll with dough stick and beef rice roll. It also came with a side of vegetable and soup. They were both pretty good. Hubs ordered the beef tripe lomein. It has lungs and tripes and looked gross but he liked it. I was afraid to eat it! I ordered the pork and salted fish rice casserole. Had to wait 30 mins for this because they were making it fresh. I loved it. The rice were nice and crispy! Service was friendly. What I didn't care was that the food court and restrooms were icky. We got turned off when it was time to throw our garbage away. There was a bucket with a strainer so we can spill our soup out and the strainer would catch any food left over. Ick!"}
