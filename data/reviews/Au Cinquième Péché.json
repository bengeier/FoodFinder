{"text":"Excellent food, expertly prepared, specially the Ris de Veau (sweetbread). Everything we ordered tasted great, (onglet, the fish of the day, beef tongue, gnocchi Poutine, octopus appetizer) and they were all presented with fresh accompaniments and delicate combinations. Service was also excellent. My husband and I went twice to this restaurant and it's becoming one of our favorites in Montreal."}
{"text":"Délicieux et service impeccable! Ne pas manquer le phoquonaille.... Les pétoncles sont délicieuses et non congelés  Le vin est issu de la cave du patron se laisser guider. Il manque juste un confessionnal pour le pêché de gourmandise!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Cinquieme Peche last night with a friend.  As we were strolling in the Mont Royal neighborhood, it started pouring heavily.  We ran into the first place that looked reasonable, mostly to avoid the rain.  Our lack of planning, as it turns out, paid off.  Cinquieme Peche is a small, highly imaginative French brasserie serving a limited amount of starters and entrees off a chalkboard menu.  For our starters, we had the seal (yes, the kind that clap and do tricks) tartare and a lobster broth with scallops, mussels and pancetta.  The tartare was interesting, the meat itself is fairly bland but the texture was pleasant and went well with the capers.  My lobster broth was subtle but pleasant.  As for the mains, I had the filet served with broccoli rabe, escargot and gnochi.  An unexpected combination but was perfect.  My friend had the sea breem, seared on a pan and finished off in the oven.  It was served with artichoke puree and roasted fennel and a light tomato sauce.  Outstanding.  The owners, two brothers, are from France and have been operating this restaurant  for 7 years now.  Although it is expensive, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"ACP is situated on the famous St. Denis street which has lots of bars, nightclubs and restaurants on it. So a restaurant has to be special in order to stand out from this huge assortment of eateries, and ACP does exactly that. First of all let's be clear about the price tag that is associated with this French cuisine \"gastronomie\" experience. You'd easily end up paying around $90-100 per person (aperitif, entree, dessert, coffee, tips and tax).   The decor is good in a rustic way. There's no printed menu, all the available items are written on a blackboard which covers more than half the wall adjacent to the counter. The waitress who served us, very cheerfully and patiently, explained in detail all the ingredients in the menu items we chose and how they were cooked and would be served. Although the item list is pretty limited, they have chicken, mutton, beef, fish and veggie well covered. I chose escalope de veau as my main dish with coquille St. Jacques as the entree. Both these items were very delicious. The veal escalope was served with green beans and roasted tomatoes with a chef's speciality creamy sauce. Although the portions are medium sized (you won't expect big portions in a French restaurant anyway) they compensate it with giving you a lot of bread and butter that you can have with your entree or even with your main course.   We ordered Margot 99 (I don't remember exactly) to go with our order and it was sublime. I chose mousse au chocolat as dessert and an espresso to go with it. Needless to say that the dessert was excellent as well.   The only thing which would stop me from going back to this restaurant is that it's very pricey. Apart from that it's a very good place to eat with excellent decor and ambiance. Oh and if you'd like to have a digestif, they serve cognac/grand marnier as well. Just don't drive after all these Margots and Cognacs otherwise you'd be paying about the same price in traffic tickets to SAAQ hehe."}
{"text":"I've been to Au Cinquieme Peche three times, first time for Taste MTL, 2nd time with my roomie during Burger Week and 3rd time with my friends for a farewell dinner.   Service is excellent and the waiter gives good recommendations. Their fish of the day dish is always good (I had a trout once and it was very nicely cooked, very tender and juicy). Their foie gras terrine / mousse (depending on what they have on the menu that day) are highly recommended. Their pulled pork burger is really delicious too!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. I was extremely surprised. We had the seal, asparagus salad, lamb rack, and scallops and they were all well cooked and tasted great. The ambiance was very nice, and our waiter was extremely helpful- literally one of the best waiters I have ever had. He translated the menu to us (which was only in french), made recommendations, and was extremely nice and provided impeccable service.  The only downside is that contrary to what we were told when we made the reservation, you can only get the tasting menu for the whole table- you can't just have part of the table order it. We were a bit disappointed by that, but all in all we had a great time there."}
{"text":"Definetly one of the best in town. The chef is inspired, and the waiters are the most knowledgeable I've encoutered in this town."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my friends let me pick the restaurant for our last night in Montréal. I came to Montréal for a foodie trip, but unfortunately I couldn't eat at many places because the nature of the trip changed, but I digress.   I always say that I love to eat out and definitely love to eat at places that remind me about how quality affects taste so much. After carousing & looking for a great place to eat without blowing my friends' budget, I found this little gem. I booked it immediately. I will preface this review by saying that I love to eat, but my knowledge for food is just growing and I'm still learning to be a proper foodie, so I apologize in advance if this sounds a bit amateur.   I had a little bit of a slip up when looking for the restaurant. The map in Yelp directed me otherwise, so always follow the address! (That was definitely my fault.)  When we arrived, I told them that I had a reservation and they knew me by name and had us seated. The decor was rustic yet minimal, which was a nice touch. I believe that somehow it added to the food. Yes, I am all about the ambiance.   Our waiter was incredibly nice and explained to us almost every little thing on the menu in English, which was great.   For an appetizer, I had the cheese mousse, which was delicious and unexpected. Reminded me a bit of the texture of mascarpone, only maybe a bit lighter and much more packed with flavor. I also liked that they gave us a delicious bean dip that I particularly liked and it was devoured rather quickly by my table.   I ordered the veal sweetbread as a main course. I liked it, not really knowing what sweetbread was. (Don't worry, now I know.) The only qualm I had was that it was good if you ate it while it was still warm. Unfortunately, I'm the type of person who enjoys socializing while I'm eating so it got cold and it wasn't as good. But still, I recommend it, just don't let it cool. (Which is a recommendation for a lot of dishes all around the world anyway.) The texture was great; crisp outside, soft inside. Sometimes, I crave it.   For dessert, I had panna cotta which was decent. It wasn't something I'd really write about nor was it much of a standout. What I has gotten didn't exactly resemble panna cotta but it sure did taste like it, with little mini fruity balls garnished on top. (Sorry, I'm writing this months later. And am only recalling things from memory.)  I would have rated this five stars except that towards the end of our meal, the service left a bit to be desired. I was with good company though, so it didn't really matter as much as we has all the time in the world & we're not too fussy of a group. Well, at least, I'm not. In the end, things started to take lot longer to come out than at the beginning. But if I could rate this a 4.5, I would."}
{"text":"Toute une expérience !!! Tout y est délectable, les plats plutôt complexes sont exécutés de (4) mains de maîtres. On s'y sent chouchoutés et privilégiés. On s'y est arrêtés par hasard un soir d'automne et c'est définitivement le meilleur qui nous soit arrivé pour une soirée romantique. La cuisine est belle, chaleureuse, de saison et surprenante, le service est impeccable et de très bonnes suggestions. À vrai dire tout y est meilleur, des grands classiques aux desserts de grand-mère tout semble revisité avec créativité, finesse et simplicité. On goute à de la fine cuisine sans prétention. Ses frères sont de vrais artistes. Je recommande fortement !!! Mais malheureusement, c'est dorénavant fermé... RIP"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a MUST TRY in Montreal. It has very few, but good reviews. Read about it in one of the blogs. We decided to give it a try and we can't believe the type of food they serve in such a simple but quaint little place in Plateau Mont Royal. The severs were very nice to explain to us in English all the items in their chalkboard menu. We have tried more formal dining places than this restaurant, but the food they serve here easily beats the more expensive stuff we tried in those, sometimes pretentious, places. It's THAT good. I had the tiramisu for dessert. It looked like a deconstructed version but it tasted wonderful. The price was very good for what they serve. Presentation and service were excellent. This is one place I will definitely go back to when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"I keep looking for a secret combination of keystrokes that will unlock a sixth star for me to bestow upon this gem. Up up down down left right left right A-B-A-B start! Damn!   Au Cinquième Péché (The Fifth Sin = Gluttony) evokes an immediate Pavlovian response: Just uttering the name brings an ear-to-ear grin to my face and I immediately start salivating.   I've been here at least a dozen times over the past five years and take anyone who is knowledgable or passionate about food here for dinner.   Classic bistro fare refreshed with expert touches coupled with seasonal, local and frequently organic ingredients. This is the stuff dreams are made of for a northern californian transplant. Truly exceptional cuisine by any standard, knowledgeable and warm staff, well-curated and reasonably priced wine list, great drinks, intimate interior, terrace...this restaurant has it all.   Wine and three courses = $60 - $75 per person (tax and tip included). In NY or SF, it would cost you almost double.  Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fun dining in a laid back atmosphere, Cinquieme Peche is a must-try. They serve lots of local, organic ingredients in their dishes and the result is a delicious, interesting, and exciting dinner experience.   Most of the dishes contain meat so vegetarians should be aware. My boyfriend and I don't eat red meat or poultry so we ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu - the sweet potato gnocchi - and the only fish option on the menu - the striped bass. Both were delicious and creative. The gnocchi came on a bed of kale and mushrooms with a light sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. The striped sea bass came with the most delicious puffs of cauliflower puree that almost had the consistency of marshmallows....(very, very good). It was also served on a bed of vegetables and grapefruit which worked very well... As an appetizer, we had the smoked salmon which was smoked right on the table with a tiny smoker. We thought that was pretty cool. The salmon was fresh and it was some of the BEST smoked salmon I've ever had.   For dessert, we shared a chocolate and date mousse with chocolate cookie crumbles on top.   We asked the server for a wine recommendation and she recommended a delicious bottle of organic wine that went perfectly with our meal.   The service was impeccable. Our server was so nice and really attentive even when the restaurant became really busy.  The stars of the restaurant are definitely their meat dishes however. We saw some of the other (meat) dishes coming out and we were so tempted to try some meat dishes that night. If you are a meat eater- you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner while in Montreal to partake of French food with a Montreal twist.  The restaurant had a relaxed, warm atmosphere.  I had the seal smoked seal appetizer.  It was amazing, like buffalo meat but with a hint of the sea   For the main course had the Sweetbreads and a taste of the beef.  The Sweetbreads were very nice to try.   The beef is the type of dish you come back for and recommend to your friends."}
{"text":"Every bite was very flavorful. I had the cheese mousse small plate (comes with beet & cheese squares), as well as the cod entree. Both were absolutely delicious and full of different flavors (the eggplant sauce and the tomato bites on the cod entree complimented the dish just great). Nice friendly service too, besides the long wait for the main entrees. We sat at the bar so we got to watch all appetizers & desserts being made which was entertaining and mouth watering!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Here for an extended stay this year, and might find something that beats this amazing little spot (now located on St. Denis around the corner from its original location), but I doubt it.  Their veal sweetbreads remain a favorite - beautiful flavor and texture, a slight golden crust on them that provides a small crunch before getting into the perfectly cooked meat, which is soft and sublime. I have yet to have better sweetbreads, anywhere. Especially one that is balanced so perfectly as this one, which features roasted mushrooms, exceptionally smooth parsnip puree, and seasonal accent veg (Brussels sprouts leaves, or this time, with fiddlehead fern for spring), all with a delicious sauce.  For the first time, also tried what apparently has become a spring/summer feature on their menu: seal. Served 3 ways as an appetizer - smoked, dried, and as a nicely kicky spiced hard sausage. I'd never had seal and didn't know what to expect. I anticipated oily, maybe. But the meat, rich and brick-red, is delicious. If you've had bison, it might be closest to that, but as prepared here, think bison sausage. The plate was essentially a charcuterie, with delicious, lightly pickled veg such as baby fennel.  The salmon with lobster ravioli (main) was a terrific blend of light and rich, topped with shaved fennel, with the ravioli accented by licorice (a nice complement to the rich lobster). The pork terrine appetizer was like the most decadent head cheese (one of my favorite things in this world when done well), with a swath of fois gras running through the middle. It was served with cooked pears and grapes, not quite a compote but on its way - a nice play of sweet and tart with the rich terrine.  Dessert, too, was no exception. I should have taken a pass, the meal was already so rich, but they pay the same attention to the last course as the others. A chocolate and Espelette pepper ganache was served with a perfect grapefruit and basil granite. If that sounds rich, the cheesecake was richer - infused with chicory, which maybe got buried in the cheesecake - and served with cooked, spiced prunes.  The service was again above and beyond friendly and attentive, even at their busiest (and I went on a Saturday night). That's been my experience every time.  Thank goodness they didn't move far. I'll be back in the coming weeks as the season and menu change."}
{"text":"Fine, inventive, surprising and delicious French cuisine. They use the finest local products and even the waiters are very knowledgeable about the origins of the products and the complex ways in which they are transformed in the kitchen. It was an enlightening and delightful experience.   That's what cuisine should always be: constantly re-invented by a smart and passionate chef."}
{"text":"Hands down incredible. Every time I go.   Don't even bother looking at the wine list. Every time we go, we just ask for a recommendation to go with our meals- and I'm always blown away by the variety, quality and price (as in the cheapness) of what they bring out. Always super polite and helpful as well for both the wine lists and the actual daily menu.   The food is consistently inventive and amazingly delicious - everything from seal, to fried veal brains - elk to duck. All done perfectly and in ways I hadn't expected.   Definitely a solid must go-to place. The neighborhood is great for a drink afterward as well."}
{"text":"I experienced an extraordinary evening here when at a conference in Montreal.  Our group reserved the entire restaurant for the evening, and were treated to a small bites menu with 20 amazing tastes.  The offerings ranged from a mascarpone mousse with grapes and walnuts to date streusel with duck confit to duck heart tartar to smoked seal.  Each was exquisitely prepared and beautifully presented.  The atmosphere was wonderful too -- a rustic basement room with wooden floors and stone walls.  Staff was pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Yes, they have organic/special order wines that you'll have never heard off, and their menu is written cutely on blackboard. The atmosphere is great, albeit loud, but the service was attentive and despite the size of the place it feels like a family affair where everybody's just a friend visiting.  But the food was mostly just Meh. Sure, the phoqonailles (seal slides) was strong and quite tasty.  - The seal mergez poutine was also excellent, through it underplayed its sauce and it felt like a little plate of random things more than a poutine.   - The duck heart tartar with foie gras shavings was underwelming, and I could hardly taste the duck.   - The prime cut of beef was very simply prepared, cooked medium unless asked, and was served with some of the best dauphines potatoes I can remember having.   -The seabream (la dorade) was the most average meal of the evening, and the ris-de-veau was barely batter.  As a Quebecois expat just in town for a couple days, I miss the Montreal restaurants and try to make the most of my trip here. DC just isn't even close when it comes to good meals.   Perhaps my mistake was that the night before, I went to Le Club Chasse et Peche for dinner. Both meals ended up costing about $175-200 for two, but as I was paying and kept thinking about the meal from the night before I ended up feeling a little frustrated.   I guess in the end, it's one of these \"been there, done that\" following Anthony Bourdain around. Once is enough. And I can cross off \"eating seal\" from my foodie bucket list."}
{"text":"Very original menu. We had the seal platter, which was astonishing. I expected bland and fatty meat but it was quite the opposite. It tasted different according to each way it was prepared. We also tried the Gravlax of trout, the asparagus (perfectly cooked), and the \"poutine\". For main courses, we had the waterzooi with scallops, the magret de canard with foie gras and something else I can't remember. The wine recommendations were spot-on and the service was enchanting. It was also not as spendy as I expected it to be. My one disappointment was that it wasn't dressy at all (despite what it says in the description). With such a sophisticated offering, I'd like to see a more elaborate décor and clientèle that don't come out in hiking sandals."}
{"text":"Q:  How do you follow-up from Au-Pied-de-Cochon dinner 30 minutes ago?  A:                                        Au Cinquième Péché                                               -=[The Fifth Sin]=-                                               otherwise known as...                                                     ~GLUTTONY~                                         55555     55{3.5}55     55555                        Au 5ième Péché continues the pleasantness of wonderful services in Montreal. Truly unexpected to the point of skepticism prior to the Joy of being served upon. Beyond knowledgeable, absolutely charming, English bilingual service everywhere. Professionalism that leaves my Hometown service staff something to be desired.  Saumon fumé Minute (Minute Smoked Salmon)  Clean and simplistic with added sensory playfulness in presentation. Fusion in concept, bringing Japanese elements to a Canadian classic. Light scent of Smoke permeates from metallic contraption to our noses. Sashimi, both visually and texturally with essense of Smoked Salmon.  Ris de Veau (Veal Sweetbread)  Noteable as the Chef's Piece de Resistance we forego the Canard dish. The Sweetbread itself is fried to the classic technical specifications. It relies on the crisp Pancetta as textural contrast support to the softness. The sweated Vegetation beneath was delicious enough to stand on it's own. Observation alone reminds me of styles from the American South.  Cheesecake aux Pruneaux (Cheesecake with Prunes)  You've read correctly, Prunes!  Prunes!  Prunes!  Did you take a step back? Considering the factor of my Friend's health from luxurious rich Montreal intake. Best to keep her health regulated before she overdoses again in Toronto. The compote with whole pieces give a chew Apricot-like with the flavour of.... Remember when you first had the taste of Prunes?  Yeah~"}
{"text":"Excellent service in a laid back environment. Octopus salad is amazing: tender meat with refreshing chilly sauce. Calf sweetbread is something I still haven't figured out what it is but it's good. Duck leg (daily special) is awesome: crispy on the outside and tender inside. Desserts are surprisingly good especially Paris Lille."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, carefully crafted, beautifully presented, paired well with wines...it was a great dining experience overall.  The restaurant was recommended by our Canadian host.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful, and our waiter suggested a salmon appetizer and veal sweetbread entree.  The sweetbread was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I can't say enough positives about the dining experience here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the truly great meals I have ever eaten. Service was impeccable and the food utterly sublime. Highly highly recommended"}
{"text":"Cute resto on St-Denis, rustic feel, the menu is written on the board. We had the ris de veau, the elk, oysters, their insanely buttery brownie. Service was great and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic place with very good (though possibly a half-step short of amazing) food and excellent service in a rustic casual atmosphere, this is it.  The beef tongue and hanger steak were the best choices at our table. The veal sweetbreads were better than average, but you could probably do better elsewhere. The oysters were fresh and had a delicious vinaigrette with them.  The service here is excellent. Our server took great care to explain the menu in detail, refill wine glasses, and make suggestions.  In a great food town, this is a very good choice for the money."}
{"text":"I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars, but the food here is exceptional, as is the service.  We are from Portland, Oregon, so food is part of our culture, and we are used to good food.  The atmosphere is very charming, rustic and feels very comforting.  The restaurant is not too big, so you are sure to get personalized service.  The waiter came over to us immediately, and told us about the food of the day specials, and took our order for drinks.  The service was just right.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  My husband started with a tomato salad.  The tomatoes were organic and multi colored.  I am not sure if I had ever seen a green tomato.  He said it was delicious.  The portion was good sized and he ate it all.  I had the cold melon and lobster soup, with a whole bunch of deliciousness and lots of lobster.  For the main course, I had bison with cooked peaches, roasted onion puree.  The bison was cooked perfectly.  I'm not sure if I have ever had bison before, so didn't know what to expect, but it was perfect.  My husband had the fish of the day which was sockeye salmon with fresh vegetables and mussels in a liquid mussel sauce.    For dessert we had the fresh homemade almond cakes with fruit and also the chocolate tart.    A good time was had by all.  I don't know when I will be back in Montreal, but I would definitely come here again if I am in this city."}

{"text":"Thank you Food Network for encouraging me to be more daring when it comes to food; Thank you 5ieme Peche for providing the opportunity!  As an appetizer I had Duck Heart Tartare. That's right, RAW duck heart.  It tasted a lot like Beef Tartare with a little special something.... Delicious!  As a main course I had Sweet Breads!  I have had these many times; this place made them very well.  Creamy and silky on the inside, beautifully crispy on the outside!  5ieme Peche regularly serves \"organ meats\".  Many people are grossed out by the idea of eating animal innards but truthfully they are quite underused and unappreciated (especially by us \"spoiled\" Canadians and Americans).  Once you get passed the idea of eating \"guts\" you will truly appreciate and enjoy them!    5ieme Peche definitely is the best place to explore!"}
{"text":"Première fois dans ce restaurant, pour la St Valentin ! L'attente est donc un peu plus élevée, bien que l'endroit figure dans le guide mixeur, qui se trompe rarement sur l'excellence des lieux qu'il présente...  Pour le 14 février, un menu unique de 5 plats : l'amuse-bouche potage potiron - coco suivi d'une première entrée : rochers chocolat noir / foie gras (excellent !!!). Pour la seconde entrée voilà du saumon gravlax en sashimi avec edamame, et nous poursuivons avec le plat principal : un morceau de cerf très tendre sur purée d'oignon.. Un délice ! Et enfin, pour terminer en beauté un pavet choco-citron tout simplement divin... Les plats sont assez proportionnés pour ne pas ressortir \"gavés\" et pour profiter jusqu'au bout (même le pain est excellent d'ailleurs...)  L'endroit est intime et cosy, et la carte des vins riche et variée. Je tiens aussi à préciser que le service a été impeccable et rapide !   Je recommande donc fortement cet endroit car j'y retournerai avec plaisir pour voir ce qu'il en est le reste de l'année :)"}
{"text":"My Au Cinquieme Peche's dining experience is just complete opposite of Au-Pied-de-Cochon's.  I called twice regarding my reservations and my calls were always answered promptly by a nice gentleman who is exceptionally accommodating.  I love ACP already right when I walked into this cozy, rustic farm house setting... with no menu aside from what on the board. The same gentlemen being our waiter offers to take my jacket... yes please!  The vibe here is laid back and no people rushing around... the setting is intimate and quiet with mostly locals...Service is attentive and sincere... definitely not a \"tourist\" scene. I like that!  ACP's menu has limited choices but what we ordered seems to all nicely plated, prepare with care with the local ingredients.  Saumon fumé -  $11 - \"Smoking\" Salmon Sashimi nicely presented on a smoking vent  Ris de Veau (Veal Sweetbread) - $31 - Deep Fried Dumplings Stuffed Sweetbread  Cheese cake et confiture de prunes  - $8 - I never really like plums.. but this is delicious... tart of the cheesecake goes well with the light sourness of plums  The staffs are just so knowledgeable with every aspect of the menu and wine list... This is one of the time I enjoyed listening to my waiter goes on and on about the ingredients and the preparation of each dish... (the accent yes!!)  Au Cinquieme Peche is just a perfect ending to my weekend in Montreal.. and one of the place I don't mind a repeat visit... Really, they have \"seal' on the menu..."}
