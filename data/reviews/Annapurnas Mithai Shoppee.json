{"text":"Great sweets, specially Ras-Malie. And the Samosas are big and fresh. You pay more then Samosa king but these taste way better. You get what you pay for :)"}
{"text":"been coming here for years and I always depend on them for the best south Asian sweets - I'm vegetarian and they also make amazing lunch food to eat in or take out... and the owners are always friendly!! and where else can you find sugar free burfee?! :)"}
{"text":"Samosas are definitely the best in Toronto! Rasmalais are ok...but as great as I thought it would be going by word of mouth reviews from friends. Owner could spruce up his behaviour a bit. Courteous and polite and respectful of his customers."}
{"text":"Take out samosas were amazing ! We will totally be back for more... they are the most flavorful with a sweet spicy chutney on the side.   Jalebis were good, soft and crispy, but could use more flavour."}
{"text":"We've been visiting Annapurnas Mithai Shoppe since the early 90s, or well, as long as I can remember. They are very well known for having the best Indian sweets in the East side of the city and are inundated with South Asians during Diwali each year.   They also have a decent array of Indian food available for lunch or take out and they make a mean Channa Bhatura. The place is pretty clean for a semi-take out restaurant. They have a few tables for eating-in but definitely don't expect waiter service.  Service - 1 star Food - 4 stars"}
{"text":"I was craving mithai and didn't want to drive to the airport so I dropped in here. The sweet selection was limited and not cheap, at $5 for half a pound ($10 for 1 pound, I guess). Half a pound gave me 5 pieces. I chose 2 kinds of gulab jamun, khoya barfi, sugar-free barfi and milk cake for my DD. The gj were very heavy with syrup and a bit dense in the centre. The other items were sweet but had little/no aromatic spices.  Guess I'll have to head out to the airport and Sweet India for my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This is a nice place if you are looking for Indian snacks and sweets. The Samosas and the Pakoras are something that you'd enjoy but are pricey. [7$ for a pound of pakoras]. The service is okay but you don't really care because most of the time you are in a take away mode. I wish they served some nice masala chai too!"}
{"text":"Quality food. Unpretentious service.   Bit pricy  when compared with Mistaan. Eg. Samosa $0.85. Veggie Thali $8.75. Can of coke $1.25.   But food is great and spices well balanced."}
{"text":"Great samosas, nice vegetarian lunches and awesome burfees.  I love this place.  Clean, friendly and well run.  They have a small di e in area but mostly for takeout."}
{"text":"I've been coming here to get samosas and mithai for a few years. I found this was one of the few nice samosa places in Scarborough. A bit pricey at .80 cents each but worth it. I always call ahead to make sure the samosas are freshly fried before picking up and the owner always seems offended when asking. The service definitely needs improving."}
{"text":"Interiors of shop are pretty shoddy, but the food is pretty good. Samosas, veg thali and besan ladoos are very good. Am pretty much a regular there"}
