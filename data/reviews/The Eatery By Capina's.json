{"text":"Always can't wait to go back!

Crazy good food and also the two couples who run Capinas are very personable and friendly, enjoy chatting with them while they prepare our food.  Love to support the little guys!

Our new goto place in Inglewood!"}

{"text":"Been here three times now and this review is long overdue.

If you find yourself wanting something quick and tasty, but better quality than say Via Cibo - you need to go to The Eatery by Capina's in historic Inglewood.

The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great and the owners/staff are friendly and you just feel like you're at home being served by grandma.

The portions are large and filling (trust me, I eat a lot).

I've had the traditional \"Spaghetti N' Meatballs\", the \"Sicilian\" and most recently the \"Porchetta Sandwich\".

The \"Porchetta Sandwich\" was AMAZING.  It's everything that you can hope for in a sandwich.  Moist, tender and flavourful meat with a bit of arugula and your choice of roasted red pepper, caramelized onions or marinated artichokes on a toasty Italian bun.

Definitely going to keep coming back here for lunch and dinner.  The place is small and there may be a wait to get a table, but well worth it.

Go here now!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carbonara and did it through Uber eats and when I got it, it tasted like dust off of a shelf and had absolutely no flavour. It had no spices and the noodles were rubbery and the sauce was all on the bottom runny like diarrhea. It had no cheese and the dust taste was so obvious it was like a book shelf from the depression. Then my partner ordered the meatballs and spaghetti and it tasted sour. It was all mushed together and the cheese on the top was the cheap shredded cheese.  The meatballs tasted like water and had no flavour. This restaurant is horrid and tastes like it's owned by whites who have never took a cooking class in their life. I would not waste my money here I would have rather ate sidekicks and ravioli."}
{"text":"Solid place! Stopped in towards the end of Stampede on the way out of town back to Edmonton. Great place and really friendly owner. Had a burger and a porchetta sandwich. My husband enjoyed the porchetta and while I didn't mind it I much preferred the burger which I thought was great. Huge portion of fries which were fresh cut potatoes and very enjoyable. Looking forward to the next trip to try out some of their other Italian specialities including the Polpette or meatball sandwich. Good job guys and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food was good, a little greasy for my liking, tables a little cramped, and greasy. I would rather eat out of a plate than a skillet even if they are quaint.   I think the cleaning agents they are using are softening up the lacquer because the tables are all a little sticky.  This joint is about as unpretentious and friendly as you can get which might explain  why even the kitchen looked like it needed a wipe down when the cook seemed to be the only one in there working.  The restaurant was was empty the entire hour we were there.  Too bad because you can tell at least one of the owners loves this little restaurant. The lady wasn't very friendly; kind of winced when I didn't order a drink with my meal and did not make us feel overly welcome or even show any appreciation when we left."}
{"text":"I was looking for a unique place in Inglewood to grab some lunch with my teenage son when we stumbled upon Capina's.  The menu is extensive with many interesting options.  The food was delicious but most importantly the service was excellent.  The owner is friendly and attentive and the food is well priced.  Definitely recommend for lunch in Inglewood!"}
