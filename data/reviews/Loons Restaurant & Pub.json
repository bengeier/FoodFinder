{"text":"Absolutely loved the patio. Probably one of the best \"hidden\" spots in Roncesvalles. Organic beer options on draft and a good crowd.  Definitely more than what I expected and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service is ok.
Wings are ok.
Burgers are ok.
Fries are great.

entertained a few people from out of town for a meeting there... on several occasions... food was at best ok.

It's a white trash atmosphere, have been several times but tired of it after bringing several people from out of town and so-so food... not worth the 5 min drive from my office.

i noticed the place is for sale on mls.ca... must be for a reason!"}
{"text":"Had the special for lunch. Soup and Sandwich. Doesn't sound bad right? Well I got a thin fat filled peice of meat, some mushrooms then two slices of bread. With a side of spilled chunky chicken soup. The meat was chewy like a leather shoe. I had a flat coke to loosen up the meat that I was chewing. Awful. If at least had one slice of cheese or a peice of onion for flavour or at least some fizz I would be happy. Just drink the beer you can't mess that up."}
{"text":"Great food. Get the pulled pork poutine! And comfortable, laid back atmosphere. I will be back for brunch (and the patio in the summer)!"}
{"text":"Alas, something about Loons doesn't quite click. I've been here both for an afternoon beer, and an evening, um, series of beers, and while it's not a particularly bad bar, somehow it never stands out for me.

The food is fine, although they can't compete with the prices of the ethnic eateries further down Roncesvalles; they also have standard bar deals like tall-boy specials. The patio out back is quite spacious, so definitely head through the bar to there if the weather is nice, as the interior seems a bit gloomy even during the day."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night for trivia night. Had the burger and pint special. The burger was not great, pretty basic. The fries were good. There was about 6 groups for trivia night. Unfortunately the MC was disappointing. She didn't seem to understand the material and by the end, she was rushing through it like she had somewhere else to be. I expected better. She didn't really seem to get the vibe of trivia night."}
{"text":"I went in when it was not busy, and was completely ignored. There were a few people at the bar getting attention, but the two staff people purposely did not acknowledge my presence. After about ten minutes I left. There are lots of good pubs out there. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very reasonably priced, and great service. Loved the pulled pork poutine and sriracha wings Can't wait to go back again in the summer when the patio is open! Definitely worth the trip to Roncy."}
{"text":"The food was completely average, my 14$ quesadilla had a slice of the tortilla missing from it, having only three pieces even though it was cut in quarters... probably eaten by one of their inept staff members.

We wanted to go originally because of them having a  Golfen Tee Golf machine, but probably should have skipped it and gone to a classier restaurant like McDonalds

I ordered an additional order of sweet potato fries because of the tiny portion of food guven in the original order, and that ended up being 8$, to which when we asked an explanation about, the incredibly rude waitress said \"they are so expensive because,\" (and i am not joking) \"they are not home made.\" I literally rolled my eyes fuether then i thought possible. She then had the nerve to say that WE were being rude, which is hilariously ironic. Apparently they are not allowed to tell customers that their sweet potayo fries are more expensive than they likely are at Harbour Sixty steak house because \"it might imply that we don't think they can afford them\" 
 Which in turn is almost insulting becausr I am not missing any teeth and actually wasn't wearing my Walmart hoodie on this occasion.

If McDonalds is too far out of your way and/or you can't make it to the soup kitchen then Loons is the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"Love the patio. Absolutely no service. A coworker and I waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge us. She did when we were leaving. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food is ok,  but you're really going for a drink on the amazing patio and to be surrounded by a bunch of other people doing the same.

Never had bad service in multiple visits but it might be a different type of place in the off season."}
{"text":"Not great food, warm beer, nice patio, but the waitresses need to work on their professionalism (no super short skirts please). I'd say why, but I don't want to embarrass anyone. 

Not really worth your money, but if you're walking in to watch a game and have a few drinks, this place will do fine."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful patio with lots of tv screens and it is a nice, comfortable environment with clientele of all ages. Food is just pub food so don't expect gastropub or any other fanciness. Its low key, affordable and local. Enjoyable and relaxing  for the days you can't cook, don't want to cook or when you are tired of drinking beer on your front steps and need a patio. Lol!"}
{"text":"- small and standard pub in roncy with a shuffleboard
- nothing special, but nothing terrible about it.
- didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great place for a quick bite or date night. The sweet potato fries are kickass."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and kindly warned me that my burnt hamburger would not be replaced anytime soon, because the chef had disappeared. My fault really; I walk into this dank interior with a vague memory of a well - seasoned burger on an afternoon now long ago. That was then, this is now. The people around me seem to know that the mini pitcher happy hour is the reason to be here. You can huddle over your brew and relive the glory of 80s rock while trying to decipher the scrawls knifed into the table. I'm wondering; does that baby's mother know the babysitter brings him here?
Hopefully just an off day."}
{"text":"Slow service, bad food, and floaties in the drinks. 

I came here to enjoy the back patio on a beautiful and sunny Sunday afternoon. My friend and I were greeted by the slow server about 15 minutes after we seated ourselves. We were parched so we asked for water (and beer). Unsurprisingly, only the beer arrived and there was no mention of our neglected water. 

I ordered the poutine which was clearly described in the menu as containing \"cheese curds\". My pet peeve when it comes to poutine is when its made with shredded mozzarella, as it was here. News flash: that is NOT poutine! That is just an order of cheese fries. False advertising.

On top of that, both of our drinks had weird floaties in them but our server was far to absent for us to mention this to him. He finally came back around when we were ready to pay our bill but the credit card machine was broken so we were advised to go pay at the bar. No apologies for the inconvenience.

Customer service? Or self-service? Not coming back here. A disappointing waste of a nice space."}
{"text":"The Loon has a shuffleboard! The great game of shuffle-boarding brings me back to my youth where i spent hours on my grandparents board.
The Loon is like many pubs in the Polish hub...OK. 
Now they have a great multi teared patio out back which is great for hanging out in the summer. The wait staff is not afraid to stir up it - as we once had a debate over how the Loon was our national animal. She claimed it was the Beaver?! But it's nice to have a pub where the people have personality!
They have some good live music on some nights, and they always have beer. So its on my list of places to drink beer! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Loons Restaurant came highly recommended by my fianc√© who sat on the back deck earlier having a beer. He was meeting with friends slash colleagues and said it was a great spot. 

Definitely true. Has muskoka chairs out back and tv's in a few corners to catch the jays game. Low key group of people. 
Limited servers on the back deck and got the sense that many were finding the service slow. Aside from that, the samosa, the turkey avocado club, and the pulled pork sandwich were solid. I'm fries obsessed and the Loon's fries are great. 
Easy to find parking as well."}
{"text":"Ok, ok.  Maybe dropping Loons to two stars was a little much.  I was being pouty about Bleucheesegate... and while it's still thin and not bleu cheese but sour cream mixed with milk... that still shouldn't deter you from going here.  Not that I ever intended that.

Because, seriously?  Loons' wings are among the best in the High Park/Roncy strip, and maybe even among the best in the city.  Large pieces, excellent sauces.  Even their \"mild\" has a rich flavour that's rarely found elsewhere, and I'm a suicide (or worse, \"Loony\", fan).

But the best addition to their menu has to be the pulled pork sandwiches. Nom nom nom..."}
{"text":"Amazing pub it's one of the best in the roncie patio its really cool so is everything else that they serve and do ..!!!"}
{"text":"A dozen beers on tap and most of them good local craft beers at the right price ... King Pilsner @ $5.00/ pint. Friendly service, good food .... Oh ... and
... THE BEST DAMN PATIO ON RONCY ... PERIOD!!!"}
{"text":"Before Gord and I saw David Wilcox, we had supper a couple blocks south at Loons.

We split an order of pita bread and hummus.  I could taste chilli powder in the hummus, which I found odd.

Gord ordered Fish & Chips.  He wasn't too crazy about it and wouldn't order it again there. I tried a piece ... though I liked the texture of the batter, all I could taste was oil.

I ordered medium wings ... apparently they are $8 on Saturdays.  They were okay, not great.  They were overcooked and it seemed like they'd been sitting around for a while (they were warm, not hot).

So not a great meal and we won't rushing back.

Justin was our server and he took good care of us."}
{"text":"Had lots of beer here and I got really drunk!
The atmosphere he was so much fun, people in the bar were singing and the patio in the back is just fantastic. One Irish chick was having so much fun she tried to lite up a smoke at the bar!
Some old guy got up out of his chair (he was playing cards) and started yelling at them. She eventually needed to be carried out the front door by one of her friends, that just shows you how much fun Loons can be!! 

I will come back here for sure! It's a really great place and I don't think too many places like this exist in the city anymore, swing by this summer with your friends and rock the patio. I know I will. Cheers!

Notes:
-Clean Environment 
-AMAZING atmosphere
-Very friendly staff
-GREAT prices on drinks and food
-Near the subway station / Street car stops
Can't say anymore great things about this place"}
