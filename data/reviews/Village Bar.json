{"text":"3.75/5, Very good burger, good fries,and fun low-key, \"Ma-and-Pa\"-esque atmosphere.   Pros: +Really good burger--great even, but not in the same tier as burger greats (to me) like In-n-Out, Little Big Burger, or Freshness Burger.   +Really, really chill environment. Maybe chalk this up to there being more older familes and even retirees, but when golf is on a big screen and on mute over coldplay and the like, you know it is chill. Perhaps the limited space (parking and physical) contributes to the homey atmosphere as well (pro or con, see below)  +Friendly barstaff, which goes with the chill environment. Not afraid to ask how the burgers are and interact with their patrons, many of whom know the people by name (and vice versa).  +Quirky tables with unique \"centerpieces\" that are collections visible under the glass top of the table.  Cons: -Limited selection of drinks, not a full bar. But then, this isn't trying to be a full bar.  -Food selection feels very limited. A burger, a hot dog, fries, blocks of cheese, that's about it. Now, if what little food you DO make is FANTASTIC (like Little Big Burger does, with only one kind of beef or veggie burgers and one kind of fries), that is understandable and completely fine. But, if you are only great at one thing and the rest is average...well, you get the picture.  -Food quality, other than the burger, did not impress us beyond average (see above).  -parking was adequate, but I was a bit worried. There are maybe 10-12 spaces, which is pretty much how many people would fit inside the pub, but if you want to eat here when it's busy/without parking, it may not be convenient.  -Must pay with cash, as they don't take cards. They have an ATM inside, but it is a negative.  OVERALL:  Definitely worth stopping in for a burger and fries at least two to three times to get a well-rounded experience. As the barstaff are eager to point out (and is on their sign), they were rated by the Travel Channel as one of the top 100 best places for burgers in the U.S., and while the exact rating in that top 100 isn't referenced, that should tell you, at the very least, you're going to get something good.  The negatives, while a few and do add up to losing 1.25 stars to me, shouldn't detract you from trying it out. Definitely better than most other options in Madison!  If, after two or three times, you find it growing on you, you may like it enough to become a regular (and they definitely know the regulars' names around here, feeling like a little like \"Cheers\" except maybe an older crowd)"}
{"text":"Great place.my dad took me here when i was a kid.living in titletown now...miss the burgers big time.william b. Moore.hi mark!"}
{"text":"I have to compare this burger joint to my home town Lions Tap:  the fries are better here,  the burger patty is good and on par but lacks condiments and choices of doing a double or adding bacon which would add a bunch.  They only accept cash so credit cards are not an option."}
{"text":"Have been eating cheeseburgers with fried onions and french fries here for about 20 years. They also have excellent smoked brats and make a mean steak sandwich. You will find many regulars here from the neighborhood and the city (a former governor likes to drop in to play gin rummy). It is a pleasant, low-key place. I now live 1000s of miles away but try to drop in when I am in town. Ate there last month and it was just as tasty as ever."}
{"text":"Burgers are killer! Beer is cold. Great place for lunch after a round of golf."}
{"text":"As everyone else has said, great burgers. Fries are ok.... Could be crispier.   Wish they sold onion rings though.... :-/"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Madison bar none, which is crazy because the grill is tiny and manned by one person.  My dad grew up in the neighborhood so i was basically at the Village at least once a week stuffing my face with cheeseburgers on hard rolls (which is the best way to order them btw trust me) and fries.  Im only 23 so i cant really speak on the beer since i havent been there for a few years (i live in CA) but i know its cheap, local and most likely delicious.  Plenty of TVs to watch Packer, Badger, Brewer and Bucks games, plenty of cool old bar decor as well which gives it a homie feel to compliment the fact that the bar itself looks like a home.  Its right across the street from Glenway too so its the perfect place after a round of golf.  Super kid friendly, my fondest memories as a kid was having the ability to walk up to the bar to order for myself and my family without being questioned, the bartenders are AWESOME.  Its a local bar that is filled with local people who are as friendly as they come in Madison.  This is authentic Wisconsin tavern food at its best.  I love everything about this place.  Walk in, eat, hang out and i promise you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great small bar and grill. Seat yourself and order at the bar. We ended up with seats at the bar. Bartender and cook were both cool and friendly to chat with. Loved the simplicity of the menu. Ordered the Brick Cheeseburger and fries. Yum, yum, yum! No frills. Just a tasty burger. I've lived in Madison for close to 20 years and can't believe I'm just finding out about this place. Bonus? Not pricey."}
{"text":"Small older building with limited seating serving typical, average bar food.   Burger is very average, and served on a small plate.   You can easily find a better burger that this one."}
{"text":"Had an unpleasant experience at this establishment. Overheard vulgar language and racist remarks from the staff behind the bar. Should have walked out-won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Friendly service, moderate prices,great food, and its decorated really well with a lot of Wisconsin teams memorabilia, beer decorations, and the tables are amazing, they have glass as the top and underneath is all sorts of cool knick knacks and souvenirs"}
{"text":"This undoubtedly has a great atmosphere, and I especially like the random decorations underneath the glass on the tables.  I would give their regular burger two stars. Cold, plain bun, ashy patties. They have much better burgers on the menu, though, so order something with some more pizzaz to it. The fries are exceptional. Five stars, easily.  I don't like how everything is so plain. Sure, it's good food, but it's too normal for my liking. You get disposable plates and plastic utensils, for crying out loud. I get that it's not a fancy Italian restaurant, but spruce up the look a little bit.  I go here for the atmosphere, not the food (excepting the fries, winka, winka). You can easily get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good burgers and friendly service.   \"Kitchen\" is just a nook on the side of the bar.   The menu consists of 7 sandwiches,  sirloin, cheeseburger,  hamburger,  brat, pork chop,  summer sausage,  and chicken breast.   They don't do lettuce and tomato, only pickles and onions (raw or fried).  Try the brick cheese with your cheeseburger or cheese plate.   Very homey setup with family - friendly service.   Tip: you must order at the bar!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, tried a couple brick burgers with fries, they were killer. Top notch, we were directed there on a burger recommendation and it proved 100% accurate. Additionally their brandy old fashioneds were very strong and tasty, service was excellent and the atmosphere was very comfortable and familiar. They have large windows that offer a nice view and a lot of bright natural light, which is unique for a neighborhood tavern setting."}
{"text":"Cool local bar vibe but the burger left me wanting more! I love the well seasoned grill in the window and the bar itself! Shoulda stayed in Sauk City for lunch today (in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar. Decent atmosphere, cheap beer and burgers. They do not accept cards though, bring your cash.  There's a Pokemon gym right inside so collect your poke swag while you're here."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself as a bit of a burger connoisseur - yes, such a thing exists! I will search far and wide (though, I'm not sure that's the actual expression) for a great burger. I've heard many a tale of the great Village Bar burger, that uses the power of steam to cook their burgers. But it is a mere dive bar, surely you don't mean that a cash only location such as this has mastered the art of frying a burger. Aye! I have tasted its divine glory! Now, a burger that can make me feel like I need to write in the style of a medieval knight on an epic quest must mean it's a good eat (I hate the medieval theme so much - it just happened, I'm sorry).  Back to the burger. I don't know quite how to describe the 'moistness' of the actual patty - it wasn't that it was 'juicy' because often juicy means messy. No, this was something else, burgers can easily get dry if you cook it too long, this patty was far from that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Top it with cheese and place the pickles on the side (thank you - didn't realize I needed to ask without pickles, glad to see they weren't served on my burger) and I think I just enjoyed what everyone has been raving about.  The Village Bar - you a quite a vintage little place aren't you? I'm not particularly fond of dive bars, but they had so much classic memorabilia displayed in the table that made for a nice little search and discover during my wait for food. They also have plenty of tvs (even some flat screens) to watch the game of your choosing. I must say, I was annoyed that they don't take cards, though I'm sure my review won't be changing that anytime soon - at least they have an ATM accessible inside the bar.  There is just something about that burger that will have me stopping in again and bringing friends as they stop in town for a visit. For that reason, and that reason alone - The Village Bar has earned all five of my stars that I have to give."}
{"text":"Good burger just need more Heath inspection awareness.  No hand washing between dropping raw meat and fresh veggies.  Gloves would be nice."}
{"text":"We are from Michigan and were in town for a college basketball game and i used Yelp to find something for dinner.  SO happy I decided to give the Village Bar a try! BEST burger i have had un YEARS! Great atmosphere, like a neighborhood pub with awesome collectors decor. A MUST see & taste if you are in Madison!"}
{"text":"Remember Mr. Martini's bar in Bedford Falls?  Sorta like that without the Italian accents.  A snug little neighborhood bar with nice waitstaff. Big TVs behind the bar mean you can watch the Brewers or Packers but the sound is kept low so you can still talk.  The brick burger is awesome.  The fries are hot and crisp. So basically is the best publike bar in Madison.  No drink frat boys. Family-friendly for sure. Cash or local check only... but there's an ATM that charges 2 bucks. Take cash.  I grew up in California,  where the bars were more like Nick's bar after George Bailey never existed.  This place is a treasure.   Funny thing is I don't even drink and I still feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Awesome, small quaint place. Homey feel and a very friendly staff. Don't expect anything fancy. Your choices are hamburger, cheeseburger, brat, chicken breast etc. But what you do get is fresh, delicious simple food. Even their French fries are tasty! Definitely would go back especially on game day. A must try!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best burger I've had in Madison (I've had people say Tony Frank's is better, but I disagree).  There is a very strange beer selection here, as well, with some standards like PBR on tap, but no Rolling Rock or Coors in the place at all.  They did have some craft beers on tap though.  I went on a Monday to watch a football game, and it was a great place for that.  I'm a big fan of the ambiance, and I could see where it would be REALLY good for someone who actually knows about football and gets involved in games, since I didn't know enough to dispute calls the refs made."}
{"text":"Very simple menu, this is a bar with a small menu of food options BUT their burgers are cooked to perfection and tasty. If you're craving a beer and burger this is a good place to go. Cash only."}
{"text":"Let's be clear: The menu fits on a 4 x 6 index card on each table, and hangs on a classic dive bar sign with letters that are poked in grooves. You can count choices on your fingers, unless you're a machinist.  The burgers come out on small styrofoam plates, and if you want a knife to cut it, that comes in plastic. Wipe your mouth with 3 inch cocktail napkins. This place is not fancy. I order a Bergoff Dortmundear lager. It is one of six smart tap choices.  The prices were low, the cheeseburger and fries exceptional, and service friendly and sincere. You can see the cook work behind the bar, and he hand delivers food with pride. They use quality ingredients.   The place is busy, with most eating and above 30. There's easy parking, and it's a Madison classic Swing by for a burger."}
{"text":"I have deep roots here. My grandfather took us to \"the gum store\" when we were kids And it has been a family hang out for 70 years. When I come to town it is on my list of best places to eat.  Best burgers in town. Keep it going!"}
{"text":"I mean come on, it's The Village Bar!  Does it really need my review, a mere mortal who's lived in the Westmorland neighborhood for a brief 18 years?  I truly have nothing bad to say, why bother!  Cozy, friendly and a bit grimy, this classic tavern makes golfers from the nearby Glenway golf course feel as welcome as the group of mommies from up the street.  You can still see a slight cigarette smoke haze but that adds to the relaxed ambiance.  Embrace it.  Drinking is the primary goal here but let's face it, the Village burgers are legendary.  The small menu (if you don't like it, head to your nearest Applebee's) is easy and tasty.  I've always stuck with the classic cheeseburger and it's never let me down. Fries are great too.  The \"cheese plate\" is kinda sad if you're expecting some fancy schmancy assortment of speciality cheeses, not happening here. Enjoy the saltines and cheddar cheese squares!  Great beer assortment (some craft/some classic), awesome old fashioned's and a good variety of tunes on the jukebox complete the experience here.  Bring cash or expect to hit the ATM - credit cards not accepted!"}
{"text":"This is a great \"taste of Wisconsin\". The bar is the traditional Wisconsin style with New Glarius on tap and always a game to watch. The staff is friendly and welcoming.  The food is so delicious!! The brick burger is juicy and cheesy. Although they lack high chairs my children loved it!  Every table has memorable inside and they enjoyed looking at them."}
{"text":"A Madison icon - this place is quintessential Wisconsin - the best of the home state culture."}
{"text":"Much a-do about nothing....  This pretty much explains my thoughts on the Village Bar.  Since my first time included an awkward \"Its not you, its me\" conversation (Just a tip: Wait to have this conversation after you have eaten vs. before ordering to avoid awkward silence), I have been back a few times to see if it can deliver what people have been writing.  And....it can't.  Yes, it is a nice neighborhood bar.  Yes, the bartenders and crowd are a decent and friendly bunch.  But no, the food doesn't elevate itself from just being \"bar food\".  If you are in the neighborhood, stop in.  But if you are truly searching for great burgers, try any of the 5-10 places that do it a whole lot better."}
{"text":"It makes no sense. There's nothing about the seemingly ordinary village bar that would lend itself to crafting a mind-blowing cheeseburger, but my mind has consistently been blown. They're wizards & warlocks in front of that flat-top. They say that the burgers are all beef, but I suspect that there's a little unicorn meat added into the grind. Soft bun, melty American, fried onions, juicy unicorn, and the cold PBR on tap make me even semi-enjoy watching a Packers team not starting Aaron Rodgers.  Endorsed!"}
{"text":"Everything it 'oughtta be.  Perfect Wisconsin tavern in a great location.  The food is a great value - very tasty grill fare.  The staff is always friendly.  We feel comfortable bringing our small child here in the dinner hours (not like we'd feel bringing her to, say, some bar on campus.)  Perfect place to have a beer, watch a game, or just grab a quick dinner."}
{"text":"... i grew up in the neighborhood, The Village has great cheeseburgers and classic bartenders that one simply has to experience 1st hand to fully appreciate.  I haven't lived in Madison for a good 15 years now, but whenever I do get back there, consuming a Village cheeseburger is on 'the list' of things I do when I'm back.  Same goes for hittin' up 'The Little Store/Joes/Regent Coop' for some aged cheddar to fly home with ... and a steak at Smokies.  If you are a card player, ask the bar tender at The Village for a deck of cards, they'll have at least one to lend ya.  Long may The Village keep doin' what it does ..."}
{"text":"Madison's Village Bar, in the westside Westmoreland neighborhood, is the best bar in the universe. Madison is chock-full of great bars, but this one is really head and shoulders above the others. There is nothing else quite like the place. I went to college in Madison in the early 2000's, but I never knew The Village Bar existed until a couple years ago while I spent a year living on Madison's far west side. The number 6 Metro bus that would take me into the Isthmus goes right by The Village Bar, a quaint house-shaped place in a quiet residential area, across the street from a municipal golf course. After gazing at the classic red neon sign above the door a couple times, I decided that I had the check the place out. The food (mainly burgers) is simple, but very satisfying. My regular order there is a cheeseburger with American cheese on a hard roll with grilled onions. It is my favorite burger in town. But ultimately it isn't the food--or the idyllic, ultra-Wisconsinite surroundings and ambiance--that brings me back to The Village Bar. What makes this place my favorite bar is that it is the friendliest bar I've ever been to. And I go to bars a lot. On my second visit to this place, the staff had already begun treating me like a valued regular customer. And most of the patrons you meet there just automatically consider you their buddy. It's like the friendliest private club in the world--except anyone can join any time for free. If you are looking for a bar in Madison where you can spend a relaxing afternoon among some new friends, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar in town. No frills, phenomenal burgers, great chicken sandwiches. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I came for the burger-  After viewing a few years old episode of George Motz's \"Burger Land\", a co-worker and I stopped in for lunch one day.  Really, just a small bar with a flat top behind the bar.  Nothing any more special than you would find in countless Wisconsin small towns.  Something must have brought George here...  Enter the \"Brick Burger\"  Soft bun, smallish patty (Hand formed?  Not sure) and covered in a huge slab of Wisconsin Brick Cheese.  The burger itself seemed pretty standard.  Some salt, some pepper, and a hot grill.  3 stars for the burger-  4 stars for the messy, cheesy glob of Wisconsin Brick Cheese melted on top- Yummo!"}
{"text":"Great bloody mary & burgers. Friendly place.  Enjoyed brats& fries too! Service good but you have to go to bar to order."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and friendly service. Best burgers in Madison. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a good local dive, especially if you like golf. At the bar, you literally overlook the Tee Box at Glenway. Burgers are OK, fries are very good, beer is ok with a good selection, and they have friendly folks tending bar. Very limited food menu. I suggest a second fryer for Friday fish fry and fish sandwiches.  I would give them one more star BUT they never wash their hands!   The guy/owner working the grill will grab raw meat, then cooked fries that fall on the grill, then serve drinks, then handle money, then cheese, raw meat, serve a beer, re-stock condiments, make change, grab a bun, shake your hand, wipe his brow....you get the point...and never wash his hands. I'm not even sure if they have a hand sink at the food station...I'm sure code requires that they have one but I've watched closely twice now and haven't witnessed any hand washing.   Lately, I stick to bottled beer and spend my dining dollars elsewhere.   Check it out and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"I love the Village! It's a great neighborhood bar with even better burgers! They have a bunch of tv's for all the Packer, Badger's, and Brewer's games which is great too. It's a cozy, friendly and a truly classic Wisconsin bar. It is cash only, but they have an ATM in the bar."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burger I've ever had and great service to go with it. Get the the brick burger!!"}
{"text":"Visited Village Bar for a cheeseburger and fries on a Saturday afternoon with a party of two. It's a friendly neighborhood bar, where food is ordered at the bar and made to order.  The burgers were simple and delicious, and the fries were fresh and crispy. Two cheeseburgers, fries, and two Cokes was around $15.  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Brick Burger!  As in, the thick slab of soon-to-be melted gooey-ness cut straight from a \"Brick of Wisconsin\" Cheese!  \"If I new nothing else about you at all, that would be enough\"-A Knight's Tale!  But let's get down to why we are here... gastronomic bucket list... also known as, Chowdown Countdown.  Watch the YouTube video!  Who throws ice on the grill?  Oh yeah... anyone who knows how to \"steam-fry\" (is that a word) a moist delicious burger, that makes people travel from all over the country to this non-credit card taking dive bar!  If you really want to get in good...  you can sit at the bar and talk football!  Although the Packers are obvious, a lot of good Cleveland football was discussed in this bar as well!  Let me tell you something... Burger, Cheese, Salt & Pepper-... everyone else is just covering up their own inadequacies!  5 STARS!Pickle on the side"}
{"text":"The name couldn't be more fitting-  a small bar with a real village setting.  And the food is exactly what you expect for bar food-  burgers, brats, steak and fries.  I went for the brat and fires-  delicious.  I have to comment on the tables too-  they were glass display cases filled with all kinds of toys and memorabilia-  just a very cool setting.  I really enjoyed our visit here."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, excellent summer sausage sandwich.  Burger is one of the best in Madison.  The owner mark and the staff are great.  We will be back this is a must go to destination while in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood tavern that serves up some amazing burgers. It's all I've ever eaten here, and I actually don't know if they serve anything else... I never look at the menu, I always order the same thing.  If you're here to pregame before a Badger event, get a Bloody Mary, they're very tasty here."}
{"text":"Nice up-north, classic Wisconsin atmosphere. The bartenders are always really friendly and good to chat with. Brick burger with fries is consistently good. You might be a little sleepy afterwards though."}
{"text":"This is such a good place for lunch!  The staff is always so friendly and helpful.  The highlight, of course, is the burgers.  It is a flavor explosion!  I was just having lunch with some co-workers, we just finished eating, and decided to have a few beers.  It's the Thursday before Christmas, any work we have to do can wait.  One drink has turned into, lets just hang out all day!  Since our supervisor was with us, none of us cared.  We were having a great time, then Hank walked in.  He was with a group of his co-workers.  He was wearing a dumb Christmas sweater, but appeared to be sober, for once.  They sat next to us, I was sitting right across from him.  I looked right in his beady, bloodshot,eyes, and he looked right back at me.  I was not in the mood for trouble from him.  I got up and went to the men's.  I stopped at the bar on the way back, ordered us another round, and I ordered a round for Hank's table.  When the drinks got there, instead of being grateful, Hank yelled, \"What the heck is this!\"  Everyone turned and looked at him, as he scanned the room.  I stood up and raised my glass.  \"Merry Christmas!\"  Everyone in the place toasted, except Hank.  When everyone sat down, Hank stood up, raised his glass and screamed, \"Happy Hanukkah!\"  No one toasted with him, and he got mad.  He sat down and just started crying.  His group of co-workers acted like they didn't know him.  Finally he just put his head on the table and was sighing really loud.  Every once and a while, he would look up, and holler, \"No one loves me!\"  I was glad to see how responsible the staff was.  They did not serve him anymore.  He was ruining the mood in the place.  I recommend Village Bar.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Real clean. I was comfortable having my 2 young boys there.  The menu is very limited,but it is just a bar. The burger was better than the steak sandwich. The portions are not huge.  The clientele is mature and educated. The plates are a bit annoyingly tiny."}
{"text":"When looking for a restaurant on yelp, I think most people are hoping to find those special gems.  The village bar is a perfect example of that.  Sitting adjacent to the Glenway Golf Course on the downtown-west side of Madison, this little shack of a building holds a fun sports bar inside.  It literally has the appearance of an old house, with the same door you'd expect if you were going to visit relatives.  The interior is pretty typical for a country-style bar; you've got a few TVs, some small tables, and old men arguing about the Packers.  But therein lies the Village Bar's charm.  What truly makes it shine though is the food.  If an award should be handed out in Madison for best bar food, the Village Bar is a sure bet.  Their burgers are some of the best in Madison, with that nice homemade taste as if it were fresh off the backyard grill (and still dripping with grease).  They're small though, so you're not getting your typical half-pound bar burger with giant bun, you're getting something to make you want to come back again.  They come with some crispy fries as well, so make sure you slather on that ketchup and mustard and come hungry.  Furthermore, the Village Bar is a great place to come after a round of golf at Glenway, grab a beer, and watch the game.  It's a comfortable atmosphere, and while you've got sports fans around you, it's not like an Old Chicago style place where it's packed and rowdy.  I remember watching the Bucks playoff run here when I was young with my Dad, and it was one of the most exciting places to be as everyone was a true sports fan.  From the good sports talk to the run-ins with old friends, it's hard not to fall in love with the place.  And who knows, you might even run into a celebrity as Jerry Seinfeld came here on the recommendation of his staff when he was visiting for a show.  There is a reason for the missing star though.  One thing the village bar has never been good at was service.  Their bartenders are very blue-collar, and while this might fit in with the environment I sometimes feel awkward when simply trying to order my food.  And the clientele is basically everyone's father, so if your not part of that clientele you might feel out of place at times.  Still, don't let that stop you from coming in and scarfing some delicious dogs and burgers while you watch your favorite team."}
{"text":"Great burgers and atmosphere! A Madison original. I must stop if in the area. Family owned by a good dude. Dump the chain bars and go to a real pub..."}
