{"text":"If you live in or around Angus and you like sushi then here is a All You Can It Sushi restaurant . I've been to many sushi establishments and this one is above average, great service , the food was fresh and filling, wasn't coming apart in pieces and good bite size pieces not those huge ones that barely fit in your mouth. I live in Alliston so believe me this place will beat out the sushi restaurants in Barrie , plus it saves me the drive. 4/5 stars. Well worth it and cost is the average price."}

{"text":"Wow. Ordered delivery and was threatened by the delivery lady.....  I paid at the door exact change, and the lady who delivered said \"that price didn't include my tip\" assertively.   I was surprised at her tone and said \"okay, that's my discretion\".   She said back: \"you better remember for next time\".   I liked the food, but will not be ordering delivery again. And probably will not visit the restaurant."}
{"text":"A really delicious variety of sushi from this AYCE sushi restaurant. The interior decor leaves much to be desired, but the food assortment was really good. Some sushi could have used a little more spice or flavour but overall we were happy. However, $25 per person was steep for the quality of this sushi. Also, the menus they gave us only had weekend pricing, so we assumed it would be less money for a weekday service."}
