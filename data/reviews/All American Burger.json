{"text":"By far the worst experience I have had at any fast food place.  Took them 20 minutes to cook two burgers because the chef could only do one party at a time. There was no line in front of us. The second chef just stood there staring at me with a stupid look on his face and all he did was pick up the tray and hand it to me.  Never again."}
{"text":"All American just opened up and let me tell you. Amazing! Had the chili dog with fries and a small soda. Price is affordable and the service is 5 star! Every employee there was smiling and happy to be working. They have tons of options and they make recommendations on the fly. Great burger place. I will definitely be coming back next time I visit Metrocenter Mall."}
{"text":"All American Burger at Metro Center Mall:
Really Good! I had the Texas BBQ Burger- It was really Tasty- Fries were good to. We Love the name ! I wonder if they realize that's the name of the place Brad works at in fast times at ridgemont high? Only thing that could have made the place better?
If  Spicoli was there- LOL :)
No shirts
No Shoes
No DICE!"}
{"text":"I was at Metrocenter the other day and decided to give all American burger a try. I didn't have much cash so I tried the all beef hot dog and a medium coke. The hot dog was good and finished off my coke half way through it. I went to the counter and wanted a refill.  The girl behind the counter informed me that I can only get a refill if I got the value meal. I asked to talk to the manager and he confirmed this. So for a nickels worth of soda they have lost a customer for life plus I am telling everyone I know about the incident. I hope the owner reads this. Her employees need a lesson in customer service. All American burger won't be getting another dime of my money!"}
{"text":"I was a little hungry this morning and this burger place caught my eye in the food court. I ordered the Jr. Deluxe burger. It was really good! The cashier / cook was extremely friendly."}
