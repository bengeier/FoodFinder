{"text":"Wandered in during a Sunday evening walk.  (I'm a big fan of cider and the boyfriend humoured me even though he's a beer guy.)   Drinks:  The selection of ciders seems to be nicely curated.  We shared a flight, and I found some new favourites - the Shiny Whiskey and the Revel  Liquid Gold Dry were both great.   Food:  I had the beet salad (totally on point, not too large, with a nice balance of sweet and salty, and perfectly dressed.). The boyfriend had the burger and said it was good - I didn't taste, it so you'll have to rely on hearsay.    Service:  okay.  The server was a tiny bit distracted by the large party of a dozen or so at the back of the restaurant, but we didn't hold that against him.    Overall:  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have had the Cider House on my bookmark list for a while now.  Had the opportunity to visit it last night.  Great to see on a Wednesday night that it was operating a full capacity with people coming and going all evening.  That's always a good sign.  I am not an cider connoisseur so a well informed bar keep was helpful in making my choice.  The cider menu has an intriguing range that I would like to explore on future visits.  Also loved that it is an option to order a flight to sample different ciders.   We both enjoyed a dry cider that was not too sweet and had a light refreshing flavour.  The choice on the food menu was \"meh\".  My companion had the \"Blue\" salad which was a nicely sized portion and well enjoyed.  I had the chicken wings.  I enjoyed that fact that they had been brined and so the meat was nicely moist.  I ordered them sauced and though the BB! sauce was made in-house I enjoyed them but wasn't wowed.  I will definitely return to try other ciders and because I love the Roncesvalles area."}
{"text":"Cider House has been open about a month and already it's mobbed by the destination dining crowd. Office birthday parties, etc, which is good for them but they don't really seem up to it. Server was worked off her feet, providing good but minimally friendly service. I had a Pommies on tap which was fine but I probably would have enquired about something more exotic if I hadn't felt so rushed. Ordered a seafood chowder which was fresh but almost completely bland - more milk flavour than seafood. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"After an uneven start (some of the bad reviews are from that time) the Cider House has settled into an excellent local restaurant, especially if you like cider.  The burgers are great, the cod cakes are fantastic and the Indian style poutines are delicious winter fare."}
{"text":"Great place ,enough said ! Try the fish cakes, to die for. The  burgers and pull pork are so very good . Daily soups are good & filling,the appetizers ,big enough to share. Been there four times and was truly pleased every time.! Flights of cider to try , a great variety to help find the one for you,& it s fun! Warm and friendly atmosphere,nice waiters that that on the ball,who know the menu and always tell you the specials without having to be asked,(friendly & professional). Definitely give this place a try, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to check this place out, as cider's my choice drink. Verdict: nice! Just had a flight (4 5 oz. glasses) of cider; lots to choose from - sweet to dry - and barkeep had suggestions to suit preferences. The menu fare looked tasty; maybe next time for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Want to love and support it, but can't (yet).  We went for Valentine's Day. This was a great night to wow the neighbourhood as a new place.  Not enough servers, very on/off service. No special feeling at all - just another bar night.  No offer of a dip for wings. The food was very salty - especially the Caesar salad with no croutons and the chopped up addition of radicchio.  After two drinks, both my husband and I woke with splitting salt/additive headaches and won't be going back.  Love the concept, but they need to change a few things to succeed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cider menu changes regularly. However, VERY disappointed they got rid of their chicken wings from the munu. No word of a lie, they were the best in town. PLEASE bring them back!!!"}
{"text":"It was fun to try the different ciders, although that's not my beverage of choice. Ordered the clam chowder as a starter and was heavily disappointed - super creamy, oily, heavy tasting with a few pieces of clam and chunks of potato. Majorly lacking in any kind of flavour. I ate about 1/4 of the bowl and it was lukewarm by then and was kind of grossing me out. Followed that up with wings, which are normally a safe bet at a pub type place - they were 'meh', also oily tasting, not very hot, and also bland. My friend ordered the chickpea/chana masala dish and said it was 'fine' but again, lacking in spicing and flavour. Feeling is that without a better menu and better tasting food, this will be in/out of the hood pretty fast. Cute inside but so are the other restaurants in the area. Get a new chef!"}
{"text":"Rustic atmosphere and we didn't have any issues w service.  The waitress was trying her best and treated us pretty well.  My major gripe- this place bills itself as a craft cider bar and so their focus on cider should be their main selling point but it looked like they hadn't updated their tap list in months.  They were missing some key players in the ON cider scene too- No West Ave offerings for e.g.  This place has potential but it's a crowded market place. If the owners are reading this review please put some effort into presenting your products w some attn to detail so that people coming to your establishment aren't dissapointed.  I'd give it a second chance and if I saw that they actually cared about their offerings I could see myself there regularly."}
{"text":"Very dive bar esque. You'll see that once you walk through the thick black curtains at the door. My partner and I love dive bars, so +1!  I came here on a few occasions, trying the cider. There seem to be a lot that I didn't like, to be honest. But that's just me. Perhaps my taste buds aren't familiar with ciders other than the ones in cans, sold at LCBO.   I recently had the hot mulled cider with -wink- a shot of whiskey in it. It was really amazing and delicious!Especially with the whip cream and cinnamon on top. Yum! It reminds me of Harry Potter for some reason . Perfect on a chilly day.   Let's talk food! Every time my partner and I were here, we were blown away by the food.   The cod cakes are to die for. I would eat this over a burger, any day. It's flaky in a good way. The tartar sauce and pickled stuff (?) Really compliments the cod. Oh lord. Am I salivating while writing this review? Maybe.   The winner of the meal was the smashed potato. Presented as a side, it's unbelievable how its called that. It's super filling. Although I could eat 2 of them and be full. The potato is cheesey and fluffy on the inside. But crispy and delectable on the outside. 10/10 would order again !  Channa masala was delicious and complemented the rice. I wasn't a big fan of the naan, but my partner was.   The salad was okay, in my opinion. I like a more tart vinaigrette. I digress, the leafy greens were fresh, the shallots added a nice flavour profile, and it was good overall."}
{"text":"Very nice comfy atmosphere. The staff were friendly! Great selection of ciders and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not a cider drinker but the cider house has made me one! The butter chicken poutine is to die for. I have so many friends that are always asking when we're going g back to the cider house - everyone loves it! It can get a little slammed on Friday nights but I'll keep going back because it's such a treat. The ambiance is so warm and comfortable and the music they play is always fun and often a conversation starter."}
{"text":"I will try to make it brief: - Ciderhouse = cool concept - Nice atmosphere - Friendly servers - OK bites - average prices for the type of establishement and location  ...but on the downside, the selection of the ciders went down rapidly. Meanwhile, the quality of the selected ciders is questionable. It seems to me that people come to this place mainly because of the \"trendy cider cool place\" and that is keeping the business alive.  The question for the owner is if they want to keep it as a social hub under the flag of ciderhouse or work on it to get people who actually come to drink unique and tasty ciders."}
{"text":"Great find in Toronto! Wish there were more places like this everywhere. Lots of awesome cider choices. Kaleb was very helpful in answering questions, and helping pick out ciders for flights. Got to meet Kyle, the owner as well. Very knowledgeable and friendly. If you find yourself anywhere near cider house, definitely stop in. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I simply love coming here. This restaurant specializes in various ciders with over 20 ciders on tap. They also have delicious flights along with regular beer. The food here is amazing. Last time I came here, I ordered the pork schnitzel and ordered 2 flights of cider. This around we order a poutine flight to share and we also ordered cider and our main dishes. This time I decided to try the butter chicken with rice. Food came out relatively quickly and I have to say, I was ecstatic about the butter chicken. Hot and delicious, it was quite good. The portion of the dish and the amount of butter chicken they gave was very satisfying. It was an excellent dining experience. Overall, a wonderful place to enjoy good food and cider. Definitely a favourite place for me now and will definitely be back soon!! Highly recommend this place if you want to try a variety of cider and enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"Wife was super excited about this place; she loves cider.  I was keen to try the Clam Chowder. They didn't have any.  Was planning on following that up with Beef Schnitzel; only chicken available.  The chicken was great! Unfortunately I had to share it with my wife as she deemed her butter chicken to be close to inedible. I had a spoon of it, very runny sauce.   The ciders were a hit, but virtually very little else was."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best butter chicken.. also great service I can with the whole family and we all enjoyed it! Fresh food"}
{"text":"Had the wings with their homemade sauce, tasted like watery salsa. The poutine with peas was bland. Took over 30 minutes for meal to arrive. The waitress did work very hard and mentioned that there would be a wait. Will not be returning, overpriced food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Good Friday and was pleasantly surprised!   The ciders were plentiful and the food was delicious. I got the chicken schnitzel with smashed potato, and Cesar salad, and the beef gravy. The schnitzel and the gravy were delicious, real gravy just can't be beat. The smashed potato was meh, but the fries (that the other people at my table ordered) were AMAZING! The Cesar salad had real anchovies in the sauce (which it's supposed to and I loved, but is definitely an acquired taste). The chicken and the pork schnitzel were great and huge! The burger was also really tasty! The fries has some kind of spicy seasoning on them that picks them up beautifully, but they're perfectly fried and hot when they get to you.   Now let's talk about the restaurant in general. No one greets you when you walk in as you seat yourself after a couple moments of awkward waiting. The menu and the chalkboards are not accurate, and they have ciders that are no longer offer, or offer brunch until 3 pm (but then inform you that they've already stopped brunch when you ask for it...IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO DO IT, DON'T OFFER IT!!). The waitress did not seem super knowledgeable about the ciders and couldn't really recommend anything.   By far, the best cider was the whiskey one, with the port and the Canadian berry coming in at strong seconds. The blood orange one is gross...DO NOT ORDER.   I'll definitely be back for the food and the drinks, but would love if they changed up the service!"}
{"text":"Amazing cider!  I asked for a recommendation (I prefer fruity but dry cider) and our waitress suggested the mixed berry cider. It was delicious and a great suggestion. My partner loved the whiskey cider; it definitely had an underlying whiskey taste to it if you're into that kinda thing. They have flights here which come with any 4 ciders; again the waitress made some good suggestions based on our tastes.   The service was good, everything was clean, and the atmosphere was relaxed. There are big windows in the front, great for people-watching. The only sad thing is no patio! I'll definitely be back for the tasty cider though."}
{"text":"I love exploring new ciders so this was a great place to be!  The server explained the ciders to me in general terms, no indepth information, which I prefer.  The flights are 4 5oz glasses for $11.  I asked the server in which order I should try the ciders and sadly he had no clue.  My husband a flight of beers. The food was okay.  The butter chicken was average and my hubby said the chicken wings lacked the bbq flavour he expected with the sauce.  I'll be back to try more cider but will probably skip the food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for craft ciders.  Lots of variety, many of which I had never tried.  Highly recommend the Whisky Cider, by far the best one! I gave it four stars because I found the food to be meh for me. Their butter chicken was almost like a pub style, it was a bit greasy for me."}
{"text":"Tasty food, excellent roster of ciders, but service was in the weeds. Will definitely need to come back to reassess (and enjoy another flight or two)."}
{"text":"The cider house rules!   I'm so glad I loved this place so that I could make that very, very clever joke.   We had a great time here. The server was friendly and super attentive. I was a little put off be the previous bad reviews, but I thought the place was cost and the staff super warm!   I'm a big cider fan but my boyfriend is not. We both LOVED the entire flight of ciders and chose two very different, but equally good, full-sized ciders to drink after. I HIGHLY recommend the whiskey cider which is 11% alcohol but goes down smooth!   I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the vibe here! The service was great, all the servers and bar staff were attentive. Flights were perfect to check out their selection- I found a few ciders that I'll be buying in the future."}
{"text":"Meh. I had higher hopes for this place!! I'm a huge fan of cider and it's great that they offer a wide selection of local cider (their caramel cider is fantastic), but the overall experience just doesn't do it for me.   As a new bar, the staff isn't overly attentive or even excited about the choices they are offering. I love when I go to a bar (I'm thinking of a place like Indie Ale House) and the server makes suggestions of what to order, talks about what's new, etc. There's none of that here.   Also, let's talk about the food for a minute. Tried the caesar salad once ...so salty!! How do you mess up a caesar salad?   I really do want to love this place ... Roncy is one of my favourite neighbourhoods and a bar like this has so much more potential to offer! I hope you take these comments to heart."}
{"text":"Four of us met to try The Cider House out for dinner on a Friday night just over a week ago. It was filled with people but we were told that a table should be available in the next 20 minutes. We waited in the doorway and after 10 mins we noticed a free table. After waiting we also noticed no one was cleaning it up! One of us approached a waitress & we were able to finally grab a seat. Two of us ordered French onion soup to start but the onions weren't caramelized; they were still tangy! My husband & I both ordered the schnitzel & it was so fried, it was a very dark brown colour and extremely dry. Portion was huge though and good value for the money. Now if they could just make it taste good... The other meals weren't much better but the shrimp were okay. I felt badly for the waitress as she was working alone with help from a man who appeared to be the bartender? This just isn't someplace I'd try again as I was disappointed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"Too small place for that amount of people. Casual. Nothing special xcept Good amount of ciders choice!"}
{"text":"ONLY COME HERE FOR THE CIDER. There's a bomb elderflower/lavender (I forget which one) cider that is a must try.   But the food is horrible. It's totally edible, but still horrible Got the chicken bacon club with a poutine in the side, and at first bite you can tell the grill has not been cleaned in a while. The burnt flavour and crispy bits that clung onto the chicken and bacon overwhelmed any other flavours that the sandwich contained. The gravy for the poutine is watery, and you're lucky if you get yours warm. Of a table of 4, three of us got poutines and only one gravy was hot, but not hot enough to warm the cheese curds. And looking back, we all took out food home despite coming in ravenous."}
{"text":"Great cider selections! I ordered the chicken schnitzel and it was a bit dry but the mushroom gravy and Newfoundland fries were tasty! My friend ordered the chana and I do think, perhaps, if you're craving Indian food maybe go somewhere else and just stick to what this place specializes in, which is cider  The service is pretty good as well. They were well-informed and relaxed. Although having a physical disability I wish they had an accessible washroom. Drinking cider or any alcoholic beverage and having to worry about your bladder at the same time is not fun lol but I would go back for the cider. I hope this place becomes fully accessible by 2025. Please see: \"The path to 2025: Ontario's Accessibility Action Plan.\""}
{"text":"The first thing is that I am actually not a huge cider fan... the first is always great and the second is too sweet.  The second thing is that I am now.  We put ourselves in the hands of the server and got a whiskey cider and Pinot noir cider, which I will admit I didn't even know existed.  A fantastic start the the night.  The space is warm and cozy, loud enough to feel like it is happening but not so loud that you can't hear your dinner date... who is patiently waiting for me to finish this review.  The Caesar salad was perfect.  The butter chicken was everything you want butter chicken to be.  The lost star (4/5) was that naan was basically a warmed up pita.  Come here, ask for recommendations, have a flight, and a great evening."}
