{"text":"Guess I will never know, dropped by today and it was locked up. Curtains laying on the floor and no furniture in sight, must have folded like so many ma and Pa businesses that can't survive in these economic times, or they made their money and that was that, now living the dream in the Caribbean.."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try n support a local restaurant.......and I was so disappointed. Sorry not worth the money."}
{"text":"Is this a joke?  Chicken is tasteless, soggy, and seasoning is terrible and shaken on. The fried breasts were BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS!!!!?!? I couldn't be more disappointed. This is all going in the trash."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the fried chicken was amazing!!! The greens were really good as well. My husband had the cat fish the pieces were a very nice size and seasoned to perfection! I highly recommend Yolas if you are looking for a nice Cajun food place!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken. Great recipe. I can't wait to go back. Highly recommended.  The team was very helpful and courteous. The best fried chicken I've had since eating in the south, and actually better."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! We order $30 of food and had to throw it all away!!! Very greasy and over seasoned!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for the first time today and let's just say I was not disappointed. The owner and staff were so polite and friendly. The ambiance is that New Orleans feel and the food...Ordered to go, the three piece fish, jambalaya, red beans and rice and fried zucchini. Portions are great and the food was extremely satisfying. They are off to the right start!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!! Great atmosphere and very friendly fun staff. I highly recommend the um....... EVERYTHING!!!!! Everything I tried is sooo gooooood! Go there you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Wow! This food is fantastic! We had the fish delight, fried chicken, okra, dirty rice, and beignets. Delicious and served hot. Great flavor!!! Service was outstanding! You owe it to yourself to try it. Really hope they make it!"}
{"text":"Our first and only visit won't be back. This place is not reminiscence of Naw'lins or Louisiana and the great food found there. Dark and dingy. Got the chicken and we can do better at home with my own Cajun spice mix."}
{"text":"Food was horrible we had to throw it away ...Chicken was dry, chewy and inedible. Fries and Okra were cold and also not good, again we threw them away. I was really hoping this place was going to be great.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing food! wish I had this food back in southern california! Sean was extremely cool/friendly! talked a little basketball made me feel right at home.  Good Portions, Good Pricing, Great Owners. Wish them nothing but the best! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But the food was horrible. The fried zucchini was mushy, the chicken tasted like it was cooked in really old dirty oil that also had a bit of fish taste in it (im sure its because the old oil has been used to cook fried fish too many times before changing it and cleaning).  One of the only times I threw my food away. Need to go try the Cajun chicken at copper basin now."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and my kids really enjoy it too... Everything is super flavorful and delicious:) way better than bland KFC and Walmart chicken..."}
{"text":"Just spent $30 on a carry out order that was disgusting. The chicken was extremely greasy, the cajon fries were limp and seasoned so much they were inedible, the crab cakes lacked crab and should be called bread cakes, and the best was the peach cobbler. The ice cream was on top of the peach cobbler in the same plastic container! It doesn't take a professional chef to realize the ice cream is going to melt and cause everything to become a soup like consistency. This was a carry out order!!! We were so disappointed because this could have been a great restaurant. Looks like it will just be another restaurant to go out of business in San Tan Valley."}
{"text":"This food is OFF THE HOOOOK!  I came in to an empty restaurant during lunchtime.  I was concerned it was empty, but right away the guys who were working were so sweet and welcoming, even asked me if I have any song requests!  I ordered the spicy fried fish, red beans and rice  and garlic bread with a lemonade.  The fish was perfectly cooked, flaky and juicy with a thin crispy coating and a nice sweet heat on the spice.  Can't wait to come back and try more!  Please support this amazing local place :-)"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for fried fish. I've been here twice and have received excellent food both times! We did go into the evening for a dine-in experience.  I feel the need to respond to some other reviews, because reading them actually had me pause a little before returning for a second visit. #1 If you eat at McDonald's on a regular basis, you probably do want to skip this place. Your palate most likely isn't refined enough to appreciate the subtle nuances of the Cajun spice blend, or the fact that the oil in the fryer is a perfect match for the style of food prepared.  I love their fried okra here! It's the best I've had, but the reason that I really appreciate it, is because it's lightly coated, and you can still tell it's a vegetable that you are eating, and I actually enjoy the flavor of vegetables.  The coleslaw is fabulous for the same reason. There is actually more cabbage than sauce. The sour and sweetness heighten and enhance the vegetables rather than just trying to cover them all up with mayonnaise. #2 If you want hot crispy fried food, don't cover it up! Do you know why your McFries come in an open McPaper McBox? Because fried foods get soggy almost instantly when they are steamed. If you are going to have take out, don't call it in too early. Don't let it sit in a closed box. It will get soggy every time.  I really enjoyed hearing blues music for a while on our second visit. I think that if they played jazz and blues music exclusively it would improve the experience, but other than that I can't find much else to improve upon based on our two visits."}
{"text":"We wanted to try their chicken, so we stopped in and picked up a two piece with red beans and rice. The beans and rice were good, but the chicken lacked flavor. By the color pattern on the chicken it looked as though someone shook on some Cajun spice and fried it up. I hope they can improve their recipe and survive. They're in a tough location, tucked in a back corner where the old R&R Pizza used to be."}
{"text":"The Beignets are a must. These are the closest thing to being in New Orleans that I have ever had. Sorry for no pictures they were so good that we all ate them up before thinking about taking a picture."}
{"text":"enjoyed my meal here but sorry to say they have gone out of business"}
{"text":"We have a new local restaurant to support.  Yola's is at the NE corner of Hunt Hwy and Bella Vista tucked in the corner where the R//R Pizza used to be. It had only been open for about a week, so not yet busy.  Walking in it is a very open space with simple New Orleans Madi Gras decorations.  Sean is the front of house and is wonderfully nice, helpful about the menu and eager to please.   We ordered the 3 piece chicken, you can get regular or spicy, we ordered spicy and you get one side and a biscuit, we chose cajun fries and then ordered an extra side so we could try the red beans and rice.  This is very good, homestyle food.  The flavors are very much Louisiana, so very different than any food you can find around here, so if you are looking for new flavors this is the place for you.    The three piece chicken was a breast, a thigh and a leg, but you can order any piece you want.   The outer crust was crisp, hot and wonderfully lip tingling spicy (and I love spice ), the chicken meat tender and falling off the bone.  The fries were good, thin and spicy, and the red beans and rice very smoky, rich and laden with ham hock pieces as it should be.  I mentioned to my husband that if you were in Louisiana and went to Grandma's house for Sunday dinner, this is exactly what you'd get.  They also have okra, sweet and spicy coleslaw and peach cobbler.  They also give a 10% discount for our military and FD, so very community minded as well as good old fashioned food!  Prices are very good ($7.95 for the 3 piece meal), restaurant is clean, staff is so friendly and owners are local.  It's the perfect business to support!"}
{"text":"The fish was amazing...The Cheesecake was also great..I did not care for the peach cobbler..something was just wrong with it but everything else was amazing. The staff was very kind. Alex you are amazing...you are the main reason I come in...your smile and kindness is amazing. Your food is out of this world and soon the line will be out the door!!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm finishing my food. I ordered the 2 piece mild chicken with red beans and rice. Amazing! I am not a fan of fried chicken but this place is great! The beans were so good and the chicken fell right off the bone. The girl at the front (I forgot her name, sorry!) was super duper nice which is refreshing. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Place to eat! Alex was super friendly and helpful! The chicken was delicious and you could taste that it was made to order. The Crabcakes where awesome too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the two piece spicy chicken, fried okra, and red beans and rice and it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was amazing just fell right off the bone and seasoned to perfection. I can't wait to go back and try some different things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service. They also offer a law enforcement and military discount."}
{"text":"I Just spent over 60.00 here to feed my family of five and now I'm in the Jack in the Box drive thru. Everyone tried their food they ordered and won't even eat it. Think I'm not telling the truth?? I have receipts to prove. Prices were high but I thought that if the food was good it was with it.  Terribly disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the mom and pop places to eat! My favorite was the crab cakes but everything is great!!"}
