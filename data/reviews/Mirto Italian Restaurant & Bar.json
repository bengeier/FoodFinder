{"text":"Went with a group of friends on New Year's Eve, it wasn't busy yet the service was bad. There were enough servers for the amount of guests that night, however none of them really wanted to make our dining experience a memorable one.   The food was okay; their pasta was too hard, sauce was too salty. The bread for starter was cold and it wasn't even fresh. My point is, if you're not gonna put all effort into serving something, you might as well not serving nothing at all. Don't do anything half-assed.   The ambiance was good, I liked the atmosphere the restaurant and its decoration was giving. The servers weren't pleasant to talk/interact with.   Didn't ruin our New Year's Eve but it was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"My all time favourite Italian restaurant.  Delicious food and wonderful service.  Carlo and Tony are superstars.  We usually order pastas (love them all) and desserts, which are fresh and delicious.  Prices are great and I always leave happy. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We were using our voucher from BuyTopia which was expiring soon. Our pre-fixe 4 course meal for two. I'm not much on the ambiance side, usually my focus is more on the food only.   We both got the salad...One caesar and one arugula. Both standard and definitely half portion if someone was to order their regular price option.  We had the vegetarian fusilli pasta and bolognese pasta. Both were cooked well and the portion was half size as well. Fusilli tasted better in my gf opinion.  Our mains were the striploin cooked well at medium but with too much fat, it seem I only got half of actual meat. Gf got the salmon which is alright, but not the best.  Dessert we chose red velvet cake which is a bit dry but its alright.   Service on a friday there was two servers. One didn't seem like wearing proper uniform. One would just take the food away quickly without really patronizing us. I guess eating as a discount guest you get second class treatment...  And they automatically include the tip in the bill and give themselves the 15-20% rate regardless of service. Its alright, good thing its a chance to see what they offer which is just, 'Meh'."}
{"text":"Tucked away smaller restaurant location.The restaurant was not busy when we arrived and the decor of the restaurant leaves something to be desired.   Come hungry to this location as the portion sizes are generous. We used a Groupon deal so had to choose from their Groupon 4 course menu:  I had the arugula salad (good), my partner had the caesar salad (ok) The pasta dishes and steak were really tasty The tiramisu was to die for!!   The service was slow, however it let us enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace without feeling that we needed to rush on to our next course.  We have other locations that we enjoy more, so would only return again if we were in this area of the city."}
{"text":"Ended up here after viewing the hopeless lineup at Terroni's (at 5.45 be forewarned).  Very similar menu and style.  Food was quite good, I had the gorgonzola pasta and it was very nice, subtle and not too overpowering.  My friend ordered the veal chop and everyone at the table did a double take...a number of Fred Flintstone, brontosaurus jokes were made.  Suffice to stay it was sizable and was reportedly tasty as well.  I agree with the comment that service was a bit erratic and didn't give you that warm, well-fed jovial feeling typical of Italian restaurants.  We chalked it up partially to our early start but perhaps it is more chronic.  I would recommend as a good choice for theatre goers as an alternative to that other italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a BuyTopia.  Ordered Cesar salad, penne, and salmon with Tiramisu for dessert, something gave me Food poisoning, I was very sick about 4 hours later.  Not very pleasant, will obviously never go back.  Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"One of my last holiday lunches with my workplace family, we decided to go to Mirto. Located on Toronto Street in a restored historic building with very high ceilings and a Victorian interior, Mirto provides a welcoming and comforting place for folks to dine. There are 2 large rooms and one room can be used as a private dining area. Antonio, one of the co-owners, greeted us with gusto, he is one of my colleagues' hubby. Throughout the walls on the restaurant, patrons may notice signatures of Toronto celebrities like sport stars Kelly Gruber and Cito Gaston and even the Queen of the Nile has signed the walls of the resto. Their menu specializes in blended Italian comfort cooking with pastas, pizzas, entrees and chef specials of the day. Their freshly baked foccacia bread was very well received at the table as we were hungry"}
{"text":"No problem if a restaurant is closed to the public on a Friday night for a private event. But if someone calls to make a reservation and is disappointed, then you better pull out some customer service skills and make sure that someone wants to try to make a reservation again in the future. That phone conversation has turned me off from this place and I haven't even tasted the food."}
{"text":"It is the second time I visited this restaurant.  I almost order the same plate.  First the mussel is so juicy and tender, and then comes the Seafood pasta that tops with lots of seafood.  Of course I won't miss the Tiramisu.  Don't expect a very high class service.  It looks as if it is a family owned restaurant.  Just blend in and enjoy the good food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Carlo, who looked after us, has been in the area for over 20 years. I have arthritis and cannot manipulate some dishes. I had a craving for lamb. It was a special last night! Not all restaurants with take it off the bone for you. I cannot manipulate meat dishes  when my hands are having a bad day. Chef. Hats off to you. It was amazing. Thank you so much for my rack of lamb, presented off the bone. Fresh vegetables cooked but firm and roasted potatoes. What's not to love?! We had such fun. My husband usually brings clients here for lunch, but it was a first time for dinner. Great wine list. Fabulous special selection. Perfect menu selection. Our table had veal marsala (hubby), rack of lamb(me) and the ravioli special(my sister). Penne arrabiata was shared.We started with Gamberoni fra Diavolo. Wow. Just, wow. Put it on pasta and it would be my go-to each and every time.  I look forward to returning to Mirto. Carlo spent 8 hours painting and decorating earlier this week. Well done Carlo."}
{"text":"I finally went to Mirto's a couple weeks ago to hear music and it is ok. There are many fantastic Italian places that make great food. The prices are relatively high here, portions are kind of small for what it is. I couldn't justify going again, except maybe to hear the band again."}
{"text":"Went in here after dinner at Carisma last night for dessert and coffee. It was an impulse decision and I am so happy we decided on this cute little place!  Don't let the odd entrance fool you! Once you're inside, you are instantly welcomed by the warm lighting and kind ambiance.   The staff are super friendly too, which is always nice to see.   Our order: 1 Pc of red velvet cake - So fresh and delicious! 1 Pc of Creme brulee cheesecake - Super rich but yummy! 1 Cappachino  1 Speciality coffee w/ liquor   I give it 5 stars and will plan to come back for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and the place was practically empty - we were there about 90 minutes and including us there were only three tables seated at any one time and only five in total. I expected it to be slow, but not dead. At least the service was decent as there was no way the wouldn't be able to keep up.   You expect a good Caesar at an Italian restaurant - not so much at Mirto. No romaine lettuce and only a passable dressing. The cheese was pre-grated. It was disappointing. Next up was the rigatoni - extremely salty! I like salty, but this was too much. Next was the chicken which was pretty good.  Desert was good.   Decor is nice, but run down. Presentation of the food was very good. Looks like they're struggling and cutting corners where they think nobody will notice. Decent value with the Groupon, but won't be going back - Mercato down the street is a better bet."}
{"text":"Well I never write a bad review unless it is worthy of it, I am a positive person, and my experience with the owner last weekend has made me so mad that I have to explain my review.  The web site states \"We offer outstanding personal service in a friendly & welcoming environment.\"  and this is as far away form the truth as it can be had. The food was excellent,  however, you know when you go to the washrooms and they are dirty (which I would not let my dog use), it reflects usually on the food or the management....   Well now I understand ...  I met the owner, who is really full of himself and after my conversation with him,  and with no satisfactory resolution, I will NEVER eat here and NEVER recommend anyone to his place..... If you want to be abused and dis-respected.  then this is your place... Shame on you.  You treat me and your unpaid staff the same way no idea who raised you like that, but set an example.  Note to all artists,  do not play here, he does not pay for your services provided."}
{"text":"My dining partner asked me to meet her here at 5:30 pm on  a Tuesday.   I work up the street. Strolled in. Big burly white haired man looked at me cockeyed. Oh well - I say I think I have a reservation for 5:30 pm. he said nope nothing on my reservation list. He said \"are you paying with a groupon, because if you are I cant honour that without a reservation.\" I said I don't know because I was meeting someone who had planned it. He then said there is a problem with their gas line and no grilling could happen and only the salmon was available for a main course.  Anyways I was told where to grab a seat, and pointed at where to sit. I sat down. Waited. My dining partner arrived and sat down and said she had called earlier and heard about the gas line issue.  Big burly man arrives with water and stale bread. Another woman shows up puts on a servers pouch and starts to take our order.   I had the fusilli pasta with light cream sauce, salmon, arugula salad and TM.  Food was okay but I could see frozen veg were used. I ate it all because I was starving after work.  Would not come back here, service was null, and food was lower than average. for a $70.00 cost and valued groupon, with two glasses of wine, I still owed them $50.00.   I left feeling unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with co-workers and had a wonderful experience.  The place was not super busy, has very friendly service.  It is not super noisy so you can enjoy a nice conversation with company.  Most importantly the food was excellent!    Our group had a variety of mains such as artic char, various pizzas and pastas, and everyone had glowing reviews.  They were also able to cater to one of my group who is a celiac.  However, I'll focus on my dish - I ordered the Fettucine Pescatore (Seafood Fettucine), and it was delicious!  The pasta was clearly freshly made and done perfectly el dente.  The seafood tasted like a fresh catch and they didn't skimp on the quantity of clams, shrimp, mussels, and calamari!  The pasta was done in a tomato base that was bursting with flavour.  Put all this together and you get an excellent meal.  Price is reasonable ($25 for Seafood Fettucine).  Will definitely return to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! This place was awesome!!  Quiet because its summer and the locals like to eat outside (its in a busy downtown area) but didn't bother me any... It was my birthday dinner.  4course Italian dinner... They set the bar for any other place I go. The waiter is down to earth and very conversational- I love that! The place has a very welcoming feel, not stuck up.  The chef gets 6 stars!!! Tender chicken full of flavor and the bolognese sauce.. Amazing!   I wish we lived closer!!!"}
{"text":"Going to Mirto was a great experience! Staff is friendly and the food is delicious. Their Bistecca is incredible and the tiramisu melts in your mouth. I will be back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta.  The starters and mains are all good, but the pasta is amazing, made from scratch and done to perfection with outstanding sauces.  Great place to take your special someone out for a nice dinner in downtown TO!"}
{"text":"Great experience - food was fantastic, easily the best pasta I've tasted, and made from scratch. Excellent service, myself and my partner were made feel truly welcome. Probably the most friendly experience I've had - Carlo and Shauna were awesome!  Will definitely return, looking forward to our next meal here! (Pro tip - the drinks are excellent too!)"}
{"text":"Food here is not good, there is no flavor in the food. Terroni is just down the street, it is a MUCH better place to eat. The service and atmosphere are good so that's why it has a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Mmmm. This place was absolutely great. I got a groupon for $65 (I think right now it's $59) for a 4 course meal for two (primi, pasta, entrees and desserts). It was definitely worth it! The vibe of the restaurant is very genuine with dim lighting setting a more romantic feel. The service is impeccable. My only complaint is that every time we received a dish, they had to ask us who ordered what which was a little tiring. For the primi, I got the casear salad while my boyfriend got the arugula salad. These were simple but good. My boyfriend got the penne pomodoro whereas I got the rigatoni mirto. The penne was superior by far and I would highly recommend it. For entrees, we got the pan seared salmon and grilled striploin. The salmon was to die for, cooked perfectly and seasoned lightly but effectively. The medium rare steak was delicious although not as thick as anticipated. And finally, for dessert, we got the tiramisu and a chocolate cake slice. SO yummy! Both were delightful. I would definitely come here again with the groupon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The portions are huge and quality outstanding.  Cool music adds to the relaxed atmosphere.  Definitely a must try. Fun and friendly service. LOve it!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and the place was empty, the service is substandard and the food is average at best. Had the mixed antipasti plate which was basically a selection of cold cuts from your grocery store and the main course rigatoni with meat sauce was overcooked and without flavour. The espresso for desert however was very good.  Consider spending your time and money at a different place in you are in for food, for an espresso it has my recommendation."}
{"text":"Great food. Service could have been better. A great place if you are looking for good food away from crowds. On a Friday night this place was more or less empty."}
{"text":"After a thoroughly disappointing lunch earlier in the day in Oakville, Mirto completely stepped up to end the day on a high note.  I had the Carpaccio de vitello to start and while there was plenty on the plate it left me wanting more it was so good. Then came the linguine gamberoni and wow it was good! One of the better tomato sauces I have ever had with perfectly cooked shrimp. Then cheesecake with a creme brulee topping. Amazing.   Incredible service thrown in with a couple aperol spritzes made this an all around fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the penne alla vodka takeout.  Pasta was great, sauce was good, prosciutto was lovely.  However, the cheese on top was most certainly Kraft from a green can and it literally ruined every part of the dish that it touched.  For an \"italian\" restaurant to not even have real parmigianno reggiano or at the least some grana padano to grate over the pasta is just shameful.   For the price ($18) you might as well go to Terroni around the corner and get a real italian experience, without the cheap cheesy kraft-in-a-can after taste."}
{"text":"I was on my way to give a great review about how great the customer service was and how the portion sizes were great when my stomach started hurting. If you are using a Groupon, I hope your stomach can handle it. I am speculating it to be the house made Tiramisu seeing how a yelper had a similar experience down below. Can't imagine going back again. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Small Italian restaurant in downtown core. Food seems to be home made and decent. Service is lacking though."}
{"text":"Absolutely best food i've ever had. Wonderful atmosphere and service. Everything was timely, hot, and delicious! If you are in Toronto and looking for amazing Italian food at a decent price you should try Mirto."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. At first, I was nice, left a mediocre review on Groupon about how the service was great and the dessert was very good, but the food was bland and to just be aware that with Groupon you get a limited, specific menu.  Rather than taking the recommendation gracefully, management responded, \"With your expensive taste and high standards why are you buying Groupon.\"  All I said was that the food wasn't terribly flavorful and that some people like milder tastes, just not me.  I guess some people just can't handle the truth.  Go elsewhere, somewhere where the management isn't immature."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to the Mirto by accident.  Looking for another restaurant and asked for directions.  The owner gave directions and was so friendly, and after looking at the menu posted outside the door.  I said we should be come back tomorrow.  Went back last night and experienced a wonderful meal in a very friendly atmosphere.  My wife loves PENNE ARRABBIATA and loved this one.  I choose the RIGATONI MIRTO with Bolognes sauce.  Both had just the right amount of sauce.  Both were great and food came piping hot.  The chefs take care in crafting each dish, you can watch as they plate the items if you are sitting in the right spot.  The two gentlemen who were out front looked at each dish as it left the kitchen.  How much better can it get.  Noise level very comfortable.  Nice food, service great, and enjoyed our last night in Toronto!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is so underrated. We had absolutely exceptional service at this restaurant. The staff members are so delightful, and really made me feel like I was with family eating a homecooked meal! The owner frequently visited our table to ask how we felt about the food and truly went above and beyond to make our meal perfect.  The food is solid. I wouldn't call it innovative or unique, but rather very traditional and comfortingly familiar.   The pasta was fresh, and the fixed price menu we enjoyed was more than filling!   The homemade tiramisu is a must-try and was a highlight of the meal.   The wonderful service plus good food and lovely interior made for a great date night! I only wish that the front entrance, washroom area, etc. was a bit more visually appealing. But otherwise, it's great."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best.  The service is not great and their attitude is unbelievable.  We had a Groupon for this place and left a comment saying the food was nothing special that you can't just cook at home and they responded  'If you are such a good cook why don't you just stay home.\""}
