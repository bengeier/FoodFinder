{"text":"Hours posted say they open at 7 however they were still closed at 730 - walked there while my car was in service down the road.  Two stars due to not being open, will update if I try them sometime they are open."}
{"text":"Great place! They have 68 sandwiches to choose from and you can change them up if you'd like. The staff is friendly and professional! The breakfast burritos are so yummy! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here, we live kinda far but since he works near by we decided to make it a little date. Service was amazing & quick. I believe I got the #27! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Good sub... great people. ..got 63.. With Italian dressing.. really made a flavorful sub.... will be back."}
{"text":"Working down in that industrial part of town leaves me limited options for lunch. This place can make a good sandwich. Their bread is almost always super fresh and delicious. They have a huge variety of sandwiches to choose from and fresh lemonade. I would caution everyone to stick with the deli meat sandwiches.They use a store bought patty for the dishes that call for chicken breast, such as a buffalo chicken sandwich, and it isn't very good."}
{"text":"Bread was stale today. I have eaten here before and it was muchbetter so I don't know if I just hit bad day or something else changed? Well i may give another shot in a month or so cause owner was very understanding. At the end of the day its not about nice ;but, it certanly does not hurt!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesnt have 5 stars average.  I love this place.  Ingredients are always fresh, and the sandwiches are made perfectly.  Better than subway by a longshot, and one of my favorite places to stop when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place after a year driving by it. Glad I did! had their Philly Cheese steak. Meat was a good quality sliced very thin. Great taste, people there were very polite. You just need to get their during the off peak hours. When they are busy it's very hard to find parking. But it's still worth it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Service is excellent and they have a wide variety of sandwiches, hot and cold.  Will revisit again in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped in on vacation from California. Awesome sub, friendly environment. The staff is awesome. Friendliest people you could ever meet. Had the Spicy Italian on White Bread. Great taste with the softest bread in town...Thank you all for the delicious lunch."}
{"text":"this is a place by my work that I eat at from time to time (over the past 12 years), mainly cause it's convenient!  the food is decent, but not great.  the menu is really odd, instead of a build your own sandwich menu they have 60+ (yes, 60) pre-made ones, and the difference between some is only something simple like mayo...   if you want a sub and are in the area, it's worth a stop, but i wouldn't go out of your way for it"}
{"text":"I've been eating here on and off for about 6 years and the sanwiches are always great.  Even with new owners (which I think at this point they aren't that new anymore) the food quality has not changed. I've never gotten one bad sandwich from here. The service is always fast and friendly.   The one drawback is the parking. They are in a tiny plaza with a few other businesses and the parking is very slim.   Lunch time is very busy, probably best to call ahead and place a to go order.   Not much else to say about this place. It's a small sandwich shop with great food and service."}
{"text":"They gave me a sub that the bread was smushed flat. Whoever is making the subs is having an angry day. I won't return. Didn't notice til I got back to the office and I'm pissed!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat for lunch. Subs are pretty good. A little salty on occasion but good. This was my 2nd time there and I will be back.. my only complaint is the charge for a refill on the drink...."}
{"text":"My new favorite sub shop!  Great sandwich's and a friendly staff make for an excellent lunch time."}
{"text":"Great subs a big variety to choose from or any way you like it, great customer service they are awesome great subs, great prices and great customer service can't go wrong my favorite place only thing wish they were open on weekends other than that awesome."}
{"text":"Great subs, fresh bread and terrific macaroni salad with a drink all for under $10. Guy at the front was super friendly and welcoming despite it being close to closing. Will definitely be back for more subs..."}
{"text":"ive given them several chances to keep me as a customer..no luck...im sure they are good if youre craving the basic of the basic,like a cold ham n cheese.but anything else is heated in a microwave,all the ingredients are canned or from a jar.its close to $9-$11 if you want chips and a drink.i will no longer be going there as the meats are bland and for $7.50 i can get a philly cheese steak from a better shop like Philidelphia Sandwich Co...i will include a pic of the sandwich i just ate.#26..i was grossed out by the mushrooms from a jar that the sandwich included.i picked them off and later picked off the mushy red bell peppers."}
