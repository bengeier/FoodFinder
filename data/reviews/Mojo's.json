{"text":"Just found this place in Fountain Hills neighborhood, not in the main business area. Great place. Reminded me of the small town, neighborhood pizzeria's back near Phila.   Pizza, calzone, and Cannoli were just like back east. Friendly staff, clean intimate location. Highly recommend for great food, quieter location to socialize with friends"}
{"text":"Got the Hot Wings , Slice Sausage Pizza and a small drink was $7.50 with taxes. Lots of cheese, toasted to perfection slice of pizza. Wings were fresh and meaty. Waiter was nice an polite always asked if we needed anything. I can't say enough about the pizza it was awesome."}
{"text":"We had the fortune to eat at The Hills (formerly Mojo's) in Fountain Hills, Arizona
I shared the Pesto Pizza with a friend and it was the best I have ever had. On a prior trip out there I had the Eggplant.  I was tempted to get it again (and again, and again) but was glad to try something different. My husband had the pasta and ate every spec on his plate.  I am excited to go back and try something different.
The service was excellent and very friendly.
Just outside of the main part of town - well worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"New Owner !!!  And it is wonderful..It's a family affair. .And we wish them all the best ..!! Wonderful addition to FH..My husband has lunch here at least 3 times a week and always Great..!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the wait staff, food and atmosphere will go again for that small neighborhood feeling. Highly recommend to those in Fountain Hills, Rio Verde areas for a close place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in fountain Hills.  I've lived here for 25 years and this is the best pizza place since the old Volare's.. The zeplolis were delicious. I've also had the lobster raviolis on a separate occasion and it was great."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here with my wife.  We started with ice teas (didn't see it listed on the menu), fresh tasting and served quickly.  I had the lasagna, one of the best I've ever had!  The couple at the table next to us saw it and said how good it looked and the gentleman decided to also order it.  My wife had the eggplant parm, she liked it and said while it wasn't greasy it was just a tad dry but good.  Both dinners came with salad and bread.  The salads were very good, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, black olives with a choice of three dressings.  The bread was the only real downside of the meal, warm but tasteless.  No room for dessert but we will be back.  

I saw the pizzas being ordered by other tables and they looked good and I didn't see any leftovers at those tables!

The two young guys serving the tables while we were there were very attentive to all the customers and very friendly.  Both thanked us and wished us a good evening as we left.

I would not hesitate to recommend Mojo's as a place to dine at."}
{"text":"Extremely difficult to have a successful business of any kind in Fountain Hills. This is one we'd like to see be around for a long time. The owner's old school. He made sure to say hello and thanks for supporting his efforts. We had a fairly large cheese pizza (NY Style) and Wings for $20. Definitely good enough to make us want to go back. Good atmosphere, great pizza and great service."}
{"text":"We came to visit my family in Fountain Hills and left with a smile after having Mojo's pizza.  The white pizza with mushrooms +,  was great.   Thank's Bob for the positive review.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Placed an order several days ahead for a 3 ft chicken cutlet hero which was a big hit. The owner Jimmy made 2 dozen Zeppolis, on the fly (as I needed dessert, ) when I picked up the hero. Needless to say All was great nice to have true Italian food in Fountain Hills.  Nice job Jimmy and family. Thanks again."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a great lunch here yesterday. Good fresh salads and shared a mushroom, onion, arugula pizza with a balsamic reduction. It was excellent with great crust. Thank you."}
{"text":"I am just not a big fan of cooking so I decided to take my two year old son on a walk and try this place out! I am so happy I did. They are apparently under NEW management. The food was pretty great! We had a calzone! 

What really made the night was the whole staff as a whole, I assume it was the owner who offered to switch the TV to cartoons for my son... so we sat in the dining room and watched spongebob while we ate dinner! (It was slow...) The waitress, Jamie, was so wonderful. Probably some of the best service I have had in my life! We will definately be coming here on a bi-weekly if not weekly basis! 

Give the resturant a try one last time before you write this place off. New management is doing fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"Great Pizza,  I would rank there pizza in the top 5 in the valley.  Great customer service.  Have ordered several times in the last 2 months and even when they made a mistake the more then corrected the problem.  Thanks Keep up the Great Pizza"}
{"text":"I like Mojo's - I like them a lot. They're clearly making an effort to go beyond the basics and it shows

The antipasto salad is HUGE! Plenty to share among 2-4 people. Effort is taken with the presentation in making little rosettes out of the meats and cheeses, and I'm always a sucker for giardiniera. I wish they'd change out the canned black olives for better ones - it's a small thing, but I think it would make a world of difference

Moving on to the pizzas...they're good! VERY good! The white pizza is a solid 10! The blend of garlic, butter, ricotta and mozzarella works incredibly well. It's rich, flavorful, the crust is chewy and it's all very, very tasty. I wish the crust was a little more crisp, but I'm assuming it's deliberately not, in order to achieve the New York fold thing

I've also had the chance to try two of the house specialty gourmet pizzas. The first was the Shrimp Fra Diavalo, with spicy sauce. The sauce is amaaaaaaazing! I tried to pinpoint exactly what the heat source/taste was and still don't know, but it's wonderful!!! Usually pizza sauces marketed as \"spicy\" don't live up to their names - this one does! It is absolutely heat-spicy, but not so hot as to lose all the flavor to the heat. I'd buy jars of that sauce alone and use it on a lot of things! Hell...I'd buy jars of that sauce and eat it with a spoon! The shrimp on the other hand were a little disappointing. In other restaurants, shrimp is often overcooked to the point of never-ending rubbery chewiness - the shrimp on my pizza were on the other end of that scale, and weren't quite opaque enough. I'd actually like to see a different way of introducing the shrimp to the pizza - maybe saut√© them in a pan first to get a quick sear and a little bit of caramelization around the edges, and then toss them on top in the last minute of the oven, just so they adhere to the cheese. It would take a good pizza - and make it a GREAT pizza!!!

The Funghi pizza, on the other hand, is a complete success!!! The sweetness of the mascarpone in the cheese blend, is offset by the earthiness of the roasted mushrooms and onions, the peppery notes of the arugula, and then finished off with a hit of acid in the Fig Balsamic reduction. Again, I'd love a teeeeeeny bit more crispness in the crust, but it really is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful pizza!

On my last visit, after seeing many people mention them, I tried the Zeppolis for dessert. Served piping hot in a brown paper bag filled with powdered sugar...they're a fun way to finish a meal. And, as with the antipasto...it's a VERY generous serving and much more than one person can tackle on their own. Again, as a personal preference, I wish there was some sort of acid offset to the sweetness (lemon...raspberry...), but hey - when has fried bits of dough, rolled in sugar EVER been a bad thing? Never, right?

Overall, like I said - I like Mojo's! I like them a lot!!! And I'm not alone, so I have my fingers very tightly crossed they stay successful and become a staple in our little town, for a VERY long time to come!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza used to be very good here from what I've heard but I guess they changed something about it. It wasn't very good at all when I ordered it. I also got a meatball sub and all the meatballs were a little cold even after the waitress said multiple times that they had JUST come out of the oven, there's no way in the world that was true. It wasn't the worst of places but certainly won't be going back. They said that they are famous for their meatballs but they really just aren't that great."}
{"text":"This great little pizza and pasta place has a new owner as well as the BEST pizza in town. We had the NY style thin crust with extra cheese and it was amazing. The price is right for good quality pizza with real, fresh mozzarella cheese. They have other great Italian dishes as well. We tried the Antipasti salad and loved it. The owners son Vinny is very friendly and accommodating. They also have a nice bar area with big TVs for sports fans. They are family friendly and you feel like their family when you come here. We'll come back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York City and I know pizza. This isn't the best pizza I have ever had but it's one of the best I've had in Arizona. But that isn't exactly saying much since I've had a whole lot of horrible pizza experiences in Arizona so far. Rosatti's, Grimaldi's and Pisa Pisa are way better and are easily the best in Arizona but this spot is walking distance from my house and it isn't horrible and for that reason I give it 4 stars. I've only had their cheese pizza and cheese bread so far, both were alright. It helps that this place is right next door to a liquor store too. I must admit the day I got pizza from here I was drunk so next time I try this spot I might have to change my review since everything tends to taste better when I'm drinking."}
{"text":"Mojo's is a quaint pizzeria tucked away north of Fountain Hills. The new owner Ken introduced himself right away and took our order. As families came through with kids he'd make ballon animals for the kids and engage in friendly conversation. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. We ordered the special - 18\" Sicilian pizza with a dozen chicken wings (BBQ & Spicy) for $20. We paid extra for additional toppings. The pizza crust wasn't too thick and the crust was baked to perfection. The tomato sauce had the right amount of spice and zest sprinkled with just the right amount of cheese. The chicken wings were meaty and the sauces tasty. To end the meal we decided to take home a Pecan and Almond Joy Pie made by a Pie shop in Mesa. These were rich, but delicious. It's obvious that Ken is passionate about making Mojo's THE neighborhood pizzeria. It's always great to see owners playing a big role in engaging with their customers, taking the time to get to know them and providing them with the best culinary experience. Our total bill came to $33 which was very reasonable considering the amount of food we ordered. It's great to have Mojo's close by and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I love Mojo's! The food is clearly made fresh and in ample portions. My friend and I went and were able to split the lasagna between us quite easily. It was clearly made from scratch and reminded me of home. For dessert we got a cannoli that like the lasagna was delicious and quite big, well worth the calories! All in all we were more than satisfied and will definitely be back. Great food, fun atmosphere and good looking guys for the trifecta girls night out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Nice quiet atmosphere and nice peoples. 

I was born in America, so I know a thing or two about pizza. Lol. 

We had the garlic bread with cheese and tomatoes and a 16\" pizza with pepperoni onions black olives and half jalape√±os. I'm pretty sure this was hand tossed. It'd be nice to see the pizza kitchen but you can't. Anyway. The crust was real dough which is nice. So many places don't use real pizza dough these days. Pizza was hot and the ingredients were fresh.  It's nice to have real food once in a while. 

The place is a little pricey but worth it.  I almost dropped another star
Because of the price. But it's probably a fair price considering what you get when you buy say, little caesars."}
{"text":"The first couple of times there the food was great. I ordered a pizza to go, and when I got home it was burnt. it was too much trouble to go back and get a new one so we threw it out. I decided to give them another chance and ordered a pizza again. I was told it would be ready in 35 minutes. After going to pick it up 40 minutes later, I had to sit and wait another 30 minutes.  I was told that the dining room got busy and they had a lot of orders for pizza. I guess dining in takes priority over take out. I will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Pretty close to New York but then I have been out here so long."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious help in the decor department. It looks like a very low budget mom and pop place.

The food was actually not bad. We ordered pepperoni slices (tasted potentially pre-made), mozarella sticks, and hot wings.

The sticks and the wings were pretty good, they were fresh and hot. The marinara sauce was average.

The ice tea I ordered literally looked and tasted like instant ice tea, no bueno.

The best part - cheap."}
{"text":"This is so much more than a Pizza place.  I've been to every Italian restaurant in Fountain Hills and not one has had food that tasted this full of fresh flavor.  I would call this an Itaian Restaurant. They have a great selection of wine as well. Not to mention fresh pies and cannoli.  If you are looking for great taste, this place is it.  Its my new favorite."}
{"text":"The food has greatly improved so much I love it there every one there are so friendly and the chef Charlie is always coming up with new items for guest to try the Sunday brunch is AL ways a hit they have a wonderful salad bar and there breakfast buffet is always served hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I love Mojo's! I live in FH and it is hard to find places I really enjoy with a vegetarian diet. They are very flexible on their menu. They've made me yummy cheese-less veggie pizzas and the eggplant parm wedges without cheese are to die for! They've also made us spaghetti eggplant (instead of meatball) with eggplant in little pieces. I could eat here everyday if I could afford it! The hours in the summertime are wonky because fh is so slow during the summer. Can't blame them for that."}
{"text":"NY/NJ Italian comes to Fountain Hills!
Best NY Style pizza in Arizona!!  Under new Ownership! Run don't walk to the great little Neighborhood Gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and pretty much a tasteless sauce. Cheese was not even melted on the top. Service was good and atmosphere was nice. Need to work on the quality of the food and it would be a nice little place to eat."}
{"text":"Born in NY and raised in NJ so I think I know pizza.Until tonight the only thing I have tried was their pizza.and it is always great! Great crust and reminds me of the east coast.Eventually I'll try some of their sandwiches because they hit it out of the park with their pizzas.Unfortunately I tried the breaded mushrooms tonight.Over breaded,mushy and just plain awful! The mushrooms tasted like they were way past their prime.It was a togo order and the ranch dressing included with my shrooms was placed in the container with my shrooms and was hot by the time I got it.Nobody wants warm ranch dressing,maybe consider packaging the dressing separately....or not offer breaded fried mushrooms on the togo menu because they arrive mushy ."}
{"text":"The service was great but as a Chicagoan I took three bites of the pizza and lost my appetite. The crust is thin but flimsy not crunchy and the sauce was nonexistent while the cheese was heavy and gummy. Also, the top was so greasy I soaked a napkin with oil dabbing it before trying it. The wings were middle of the road but better than most in the area."}
{"text":"Mojo's is a hidden Italian restaurant in Fountain Hills. Sort of odd location, as it's tucked in residential area in modern-day suburbia.

My parents are ga-ga over their thin-crust pizza, so we all agree that we will dine here last Sat night.

I order a side salad w/a side of Ranch as well as a Hawaiian calzone. Not to piss-n-moan but the following went down:

-Side salad showed up drowned in Ranch. I let it go, that's fine.
-Took forever to get our dinner, but calzone showed up and looked great. I broke the \"bread blister\" on my calzone, and a weird watery liquid weeps out. Ham juice - wtf??
-Take a bite of the calzone - taste nothing but yeast - raw bread dough. I visually inspect my calzone and confirm it was undercooked. I send my meal back.

The server was very apologetic and helpful. She took back my calzone and brought me a slice of pizza. By this time, I was so hungry, I would have been ecstatic w/a stale Saltine."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner and it was great! We have been driving by it for months and finally stopped in. We got the caprese appetizer, garlic knots, margharita pizza, cheese pizza, and a calzone.  Everything was awesome. The actual restaurant is adorable and the owners son Vinny is a wonderful person. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"We called in to have a pizza delivered and we were told the delivery guy called off. No problem, we will pick up. Thirty minutes we were told. We came in thirty minutes later to be told the kitchen was a little backed up, it will be another five minutes. We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited. 30 minutes went by. At no time did anyone offer us an explanation as to what was taking so long. Finally, a customer walked back in, returning a pizza. I knew right away what happened. They gave our pie to the wrong guy! We went up to the counter and confronted the gal. She admitted that it was her fault, and that they were making us a fresh pie. Why not tell us that up front? We would have ordered a drink and waited. In the end, no attempt to appease with a discount on our next order. In fact, the gal got kind of snippy with us when we confronted her. The pie was good when we got it home, but they should have been honest with us from the beginning. They should have attempted to take care of us while we waited, or offered us something on the back end for our troubles. Completely mishandled!"}
{"text":"Ordered again on Monday and forgot to update. Last 2 orders have been pepperoni pizza. This time we changed it up and got sausage pepperoni. 
gasp... yeah, we lead a dull life
I gotta say we LOVE that it's sliced sausage instead of those little meat blobs that may or may not be hamburger, you can't be sure. So much better taste when you get the sliced sausage.
Not disappointed at all! Love this pizza. So glad it's near our house!"}
{"text":"Disappointed and we will not be back.  We thought we would give MoJo's another try.  I called and spoke to the lady on the phone.  I asked about the ravioli and lasagna entrees.  She said you get only 5 jumbo ravioli in the entree and last week when I called the man said there were 8 not sure who is correct.  She also stated the lasagna dinner was enough to feed two people.  I asked about the salt and said the pizza was almost inedible last time because it was too darn salty and she said the chef makes the sauce in the morning and a new batch a sauce can not be made for a customer. so much for the customer is always right.  So, the lasagna was awful not enough to feed one person very very thin not even one inch thick and inedible way way way too salty. The frozen lasagna in the grocery section tastes better and is way thicker without the added salt. The pizza was also inedible and way way way too salty, I threw it away.  I really expected this place to taste better and have better quality of food.  There pasta is NOT made from scratch they buy it, this might make a difference.  Maybe the chef can learn that lots of salt does not add but take away taste. The off cuff comment from the hostess about making a new batch of sauce for customers was odd and pretty much tells you, this place they do not really care about the customer or there concerns. 
 Maybe one day, Mojo's will be worth the drive but not right now unless you like over salty inedible low quality store bought pasta...I am not a fan"}
{"text":"Coming from NY it's difficult to find decent pizza. Mojo's was the closest and best we've found. Great home made crust. Found out it's made fresh every morning. Not to thin were it falls apart. Plenty of toppings. Can't wait to try other items on their menu. This is going to be our go to pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"The NEW Mojo's... NEW Ownership.. thank God !  So great to have such a good restaurant so close by.  Outstanding Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna.. The Pizza was very good also.. fresh made from scratch dough.. The owners son is one of chefs and is culinary Institute trained.  Svobatelli.. I sure hope I spelled that right.. just come close and they'll know ..  WONDERFUL little clam shaped, flaky pastry with a mascarpone cheese filling that has a hint of lemon.. Absolutely delightful with the chocolate drizzle and powdered sugar..  speaking of powdered sugar.. Order the Zeppoli's.. OMG.. not since walking down Broad St. in Manhattan have I had such Zeppoli's... So simple but so yummy..  Very Reasonable prices.. Very good service and great decor.. made me feel like a real neighborhood Italian Eatery in NY/NJ.  They're building their wine list... This location has seen many restaurants come and go in short time..  This place is so good.. it has got to stay...  We're doing our part.. we've eaten there 4 times in the last 2 weeks.. (plus take out pizza)  what can I say.... we're fans for sure.."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and we intend to go back.  The first time, my daughter and I split a pizza and my son had a sandwich.  All of the food was incredible.  The next time we went we had burgers and although they were good, they were a bit too thick.  They took a long time to prepare and then were a bit underdone.  I highly recommend having the pizza, it is one of the best I have ever eaten.  The sandwiches are also good, and the burgers would be good if they were a bit smaller."}
{"text":"Nice folks here, and while I was a little surprised at the bill, I was able to eat left overs for days. Wow. 

We visited when the place was kind of empty--sad because their food and servers were decent. We'll go back. 

PS--Ftn Hills might have restrictions against it, but you really should look into doing something to light the parking lot. It's pitch black and dangerous for older folks."}
