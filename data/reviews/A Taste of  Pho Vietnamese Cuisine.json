{"text":"I went again this past weekend since I was at Market Village and this time I was quite disappointed in their pho hence the new lower rating. 

I order the Pho Dac Biet (special) again and the broth was slightly above average, tendon was nice but the noodles were still slightly undercooked but what really disappointed me was the quality of meat they use, it's of the lowest quality and covered in fat, every single piece."}
{"text":"Hello Pho from BKK

I love your food and store.
The store, food, access are clean. Actually, I think this V restaurant is  one of the cleanest  V restaurant in Toronto, Markham, and Miss.
Love pork with lemon glass.

Never try Pho here, but my gf likes it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!  The only pho restaurant inside Market Village, I found the food to be yummy, decent prices, nice decor, with friendly staff.

We ordered :
2 for $10 special  (Pork Chop with Rice and medium size Pho Special Noodle Soup)
Tuesday special for $5.75  (Hue Style Beef Noodle Soup)

Loved all three dishes.  The pho was yummy with flavourful soup base, pork chop with rice was well done (though a bit on the dry side), the Hue style beef noodle soup was spicy and delicious.  Price was just right.  This is a Chinese owned pho place but is much cleaner than other Vietnamese restaurants and specials are cheaper!

I have been here a few times and will return again when I'm in the mall!"}

We popped in here when my boyfriend and I decided that there weren't any good vegetarian selections in the food court. When I looked at the menu, I realized that the prices here are better than what you'd normally get sitting in a noisy crowd in a mall.  The boyfriend got a veg bun, our friend a small rare beef pho and I ordered a curry vegetable and tofu with steamed rice ($5.95). Strangely, my dish had absolutely no curry but it was pretty yummy. The tofu pockets were marinated in soy sauce and the rice was garnished with green onions, which I love. I am not a fan of bok choy, but the veggies that I got were super fresh and cooked perfectly. 

Three mains and an appetizer only came to $25 after tax! Great deal and comfortable seating. Staff here is amazingly polite and will actually smile at you, especially when you make your white boyfriend close the bill in Cantonese.

BONUS: Vegetarian 'fish' sauce available here and it was so yummy I poured if all over my white rice!"}
{"text":"A taste of Pho just opened up this Monday at Market Village and I so happy that I can include this FTR in my Pho-bruary!

The restaurant is nice and chic with comfortable booth seatings on the side. (I am so into booth seatings!)

I ordered the House Special Noodle.. medium ($6.25) I am glad I order the medium as the medium is smaller than what I get at Vietnam Noodle Star for a small. Not only the noodle is less, there is hardly any meat... The beef ball is mini balls..   I was still hungry after I eat the whole bowel! (I really feel like a pig!!!)

The broth is nice and hot. They put quite a bit of herb inside includes anise and cinnamon. The noodles is the dried type. Not bad as it was cooked well. (I am still hungry!!!!)

I ended up ordering an extra spring roll ($4.25). Small 2 little spring rolls.. crispy, tasty, the way vietnmanese spring roll suppose to taste like! (I am still hungry!!)

The servers are really nice and friendly. I did make a comment about the size of the Pho... 

Cash and Debit Only!

No lunch specials!!

Compare to other Vietnamese Pho places in the area, this place is more expensive since the portion is smaller. I am not sure if I going to come here if I want value! (I am hungry already 2 hours after my lunch!)"}
