{"text":"Best burgers in Charlotte! The meat & buns are delicious & fresh and they have unique burger options (as well as traditional). I love the TNT burger, but the Hangover & Pimento are great too. They also have fabulous fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. I can't think of anywhere that has burgers or fries that are good as Bang Bang."}
{"text":"Not exactly worth the price. The burger was just ok. The fries weren't that good. There was stuff floating in the tea. The only good thing was probably the onion rings. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have to say, not bad. I'm kind of a picky burger guy but these were actually pretty good. The burgers were nice and juicy the fries were piping hot and the service was quick. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pimento burger is to die for!! Went for the first time last week and had to go back the next night because it was just so good!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best Burger's I've had since moving to the Charlotte area.  the Cowboy burger paired perfectly with A NoDa Hop Drop and Roll.

Go out of your way to find this place. One of the best bang for your buck burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Burger bowl is the best for me.   Very good source of beef - no hormones etc and I think grass fed.  I go there at least once a month or so."}
{"text":"on arrival, the restaurant menu looked a little confusing and then you figure out that it is $9.5 for a single pattie burger and then $12.00 for a double.  this price doesn't include fries or a side.  the sides are cheaper $1-2.00;  there is a side named brocolli and garlic oil that I had to ask what it was because the name sounds like a condiment or dip. the burgers were amazingly tasty and tasted flame broiled.  the bbq chips that I had were on the mediocre side.  all in all, I would go to Five Guys instead if I am going to pay that kind of money and would get a better burger."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service as soon as I stepped in the door. I ordered the TNT burger and it came out great. The bread they use for the burgers is locally made and is so delicious. I just got a water with my meal and I couldn't even drink it hardly. It tasted disgusting. I'll come back sometime soon and try a new item for sure."}
{"text":"Glad I decided to try it. I visited based on reviews and was not disappointed. The gingham style burger was great.  Really good beef with a nice different flavor than a typical burger. Fries were also really good. Service was prompt as well. If I was in town longer I would definately go back for more. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My first time at Bang Bangs and I just had thee most amazing burger ever. I tried the guacamole burger and I look forward to trying all of the rest.  This is a must stop in Charlotte North Carolina. Thanks Bang Bang, you made a regular outta me."}
{"text":"Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods, this is a great meeting place and of course, burger joint. The staff is knowledgeable and the owner is super cool. They served a free in-house BBQ potato chip appetizer while we waited. My friend got the Bang Bang Burger with their signature Bangburger sauce on the side with sweet potato fries with some kind of maple sauce. I got the Seoul burger with kimchi (of course) on a gluten free bun with hand cut fries. Both dishes were to die for. I had a little bit of everything (but for a bite of my friend's burger) and could have eaten ALL the fries and chips on my own. Even the beer recommendation paired with my slightly spicy burger made perfect sense. The only thing they (or rather, the private supplier) will need to work on is the oopsie bread, aka gluten free bun. I know they're hard to make sturdy enough for a heavy wet burger. I'm just thankful they have the option at all."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person, but this is my second time having the Gangnam Style at Bang Bang Burgers. It tastes really good with the pork belly.  Their homemade sweet potato chips taste great too. I used to think that burgers are plain fast food with no taste and nutrition values. Bang Bang Burgers with grass-fed black Angus beef and real butter buns from local bakery (Duke's Bakery) has changed my view on that.

This is definitely a place I will bring friends to."}
{"text":"Truly insane burgers. Lots of very unique options to choose from. Hard to decide but they are all dope. Also the presentation is nice which is a bonus"}
{"text":"We had an awesome first experience. The food was fresh, quick and good. We were stopping mid afternoon for a snack, and wanted to share a burger & fries. Without us asking, they brought us the burger and fries already separated on 2 trays. Nice touch! We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Stopped here after reading reviews while in town for the day. It was delicious and lived up to the reviews. I had the guacamole burger and sweet potato fries which were both delicious! Lots of food for the price, makes me wish I lived much closer!"}
{"text":"This is out favorite burger joint! I haven't had anything that I didn't like. For the vegetarians this place is really good as well since they have a black bean burger with quinoa on top that is really good! So this place is great for meat lovers and plant lovers. I have never have a better burger!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of watching this place grow from an empty restaurant with humongous but still delicious burgers to a bustling establishment with much better portioning. It is one of the unquestioned heavyweights in the Charlotte burger scene, and rightfully so. Every visit warrants a standard of quality that I've never seen falter. I suggest the cowboy or TNT burger with the hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Very good food quality. Great menu. Great friendly service. Get the double patty if you have an appetite."}
{"text":"This place is solid! Love the grass fed beef option.   At times the burgers can be a little rare so if you don't like that be sure to ask for medium well. Highly recommend checking this place out. And the fries are amazing, be careful"}
{"text":"First time here and was looking forward to it based on reviews on yelp.  Great flavors with the pork belly burger and TNT burgers, arugula/asparagus salad and pickle appetizer.  Broccoli and garlic had minimal seasoning and I would pass.  

My only complaint was that the single burger patty was so thin (smaller than a mcdonalds single burger party) that I really did not taste any burger flavor.  This is a shortcoming as if I truly want to taste the burger I would have to go elsewhere or get a double burger.  The flavors of the other items were great - just add a bit more meat."}
{"text":"This place went above my expectations. It looks like somewhere you'd pass up on if you didn't know that it had great food! 

It's got nice comfy booths and tables with comfy chairs. The set up is simple. The menu is simple. A simple menu has perhaps allowed them to focus on what they do best. The burgers were amazing! 

Each burger is cooked to order, with simple ingredients (hand made pickles were my favorite topping). The flavors were perfect, they tasted so fresh, down to the tomato and lettuce. They also have an array of simple sauces that come with certain burgers, or you can request on the side, they pack a lot of punch! I think they were homemade? They were so yummy. 

I loved the sauce that came with the Bang Bang Burger, and the BBQ with the Cowboy Burger was amazing. They topped the burgers perfectly. 

The fries were also great! Though I had to put a little extra salt - they were nice and crisp. 

Nothing was overly greasy, burnt, or undercooked. I dare to say it was a perfect meal. 

I can see the complaints about price over quantity. I agree it is a tad over priced - but luckily for me I left full and happy. Maybe opt for the double if you're super hungry ( though I suppose this doesn't help with the price predicament). 

Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely we back. I was so pleasantly surprised. Thanks yelpers for convincing me to try!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to take my family for a quick afternoon lunch while out running a few errands. They had basic burgers for the less adventurous in my group and some more exciting ones for those of us who like to try new things. I really love that they use Duke's Bread. He's a lovely local gentleman who I get my bread from at the farmer's market. There was also a specialty burger using Olde Mecklenburg Brewery beer for beer cheese. They have to local draft selections, as well. It's order at the counter style so it can be a quick in and out if needed. The fries were great!"}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers, this is as good as it gets.  I'd been meaning to drop by but got the chance when a loved one was in a nearby hospital.  As delicious as hospital food is, I needed a walk and something good.  To put in perspective I was exhausted and anything would have probably been pretty good, but WHOA.  I got the Hangover and WOW!  Some folks throw an egg on a burger and declare it fantastic.  It enhanced  the burger sure, but it was the meat.  Some claim to have the meats... They do.  Clean, lush, seasoned, perfectly cooked. I don't care where it's from.  It's the best pure burger out there.  The bangbang sauce works well with the fries.  I can say it has been a while since I got FRESH hand cut fries done right.  If you're going to bother do it right.  They did.  How eye opening was a simple late dinner of a burger and fries?  I was back the very next day.  This time I gave in to the lure of the pimento burger.
It had fried pickles.  First time ever I had a fried pickle that was worth a damn. They made me like them and educated me to the fact that they don't have to be overcooked over salty pucks.  I'd like just a side of those sometimes.  Other people swoon over them but they should let BangBang convert them.  
 
I was more than pleasantly surprised and try to recruit as many diciples as possible to this semi hidden gem in Elizabeth.  Atmosphere is relaxed and not quite as divey as my regular haunts. I can take the upgrade. Service was fast and friendly.  It all pales compared to that burger."}
{"text":"Ordered two single burgers, fries and onion rings.  Bill was almost $28!  The burgers are literally the size of a McDonalds small cheeseburger. Sad t say,  McDonalds is just as good.  I do not know why this place was crowded as it is clearly nixed for life."}
{"text":"I had the black bean burger and quinoa salad side last night and it was absolutely delicious. I loved the flavor of the burger, the spices, the swiss was great, and the flavors in the quinoa salad was incredible. I love when places like this offer healthier options that are very yummy! I loveeeee their regular burgers too....I was just wanting to be \"good\" that night...and it was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers, the best onion rings and fries in Charlotte.  If your after a burger check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate there while in town for a Hornets game and the burger was delicious. One of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Grass fed beef, guacamole burger.....yum....!  Remember to order the eggrolls and quinoa salad.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Food was great however within 5 seconds of paying asked to switch to grass fed beef. They would not do it. Sadly the place is great just wish they would honor a health  conscience consumer."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and fries! Got the standard bang bang burger and sweet potato fries. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors and combinations. It's a lot of food to! I loved the pimento cheese burger it was so good! The fries have seasoning on them also which is a plus. Everything was so good I wanted to keep eating even though I was full."}
{"text":"Another awesome encounter at Bang Bang, went on free side upgrade night and got hands down the best onion rings in town! Went with Morgan's  recommendation of the special burger and it was amazing. The other cashier(Davontaè I think his name was) was also super friendly. I love the atmosphere of this place too. All the workers definitely have a sense of family and it shows in their teamwork. Great food, awesome staff, and just an overall amazing place. I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is right in my hood, we waited for many months for it to arrive with some delays on construction.  I want to love it cause I can walk there.  My kids have eaten here quote a bit and like it.  Here is my assessment of the pimento cheese burger:  The fried pickles had so much breading I could not taste the pickle, took them off the burger after the first bite - there are a lot of fried pickle in Elizabeth, so if you are going to do them they better be right.  I would have like some more pimento cheese, it had mostly melted off the meat when I got my burger.

That being said, the burger is delicious...I want them to get the other things right, I want this place to stay.  Fries, also, are very good, I mean close to five guys good.   Taste and seem homemade.

Fix the toppings guys, I love this place and want to be walking to it ten years from now"}
{"text":"They say the best burger in Charlotte and I believe it. Couldn't decide what to order because I wanted to try everything. Excellent."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents, keep in mind that they are older people and their first reaction to trying the brugers here was \"I hate to say it, but these are some of the best burgers that I have ever had.\" We loved it and we know you will too!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food was fantastic. The volume was lacking just a little. 
Tried the cheeseburger egg roll (small for the price) and the hangover burger (better quantity) the sweet potato fries were great and I'm not a fry person.
Some of the best hamburger meat I've had in that type of restaurant.
I wouldn't go often but will definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations from seeing the other reviews.  My wife and i had Bang Bang burgers.  They were  expensive at $9.50 for an order at the counter burger and did not include sides.  I had onion rings at $4 and wife had fries $2.  Burger patties were good but small and on the dry side.  Bang Bang sauce was spiced up 1000 island.  Fries and rings were very good, but small portions for the price.  Overall it was underwhelming and over priced.  There are better burger joints in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are frequent Bang Bang customers, we love this place and the location is perfect for those special days at the comic book shop. The Guacamole and Hangover burgers are absolutely perfect, pair that with some sweet potato fries with maple dipping sauce...I'm drooling over here!

The portion sizes on the burger are completely adequate, I've never left hungry."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great burger place in the neighborhood! I have eaten there a couple of times and really love it! The house sauce is so yummy!!  I thought the staff was very warm and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers... Casual place, order at the counter and have a seat, burgers delivered within 5 minutes, cooked medium, fresh crispy hot fries. I got a double Cowboy, knocked it down no problem, my wife got the Brie Burger. No complaints at all..."}
{"text":"I had the Hangover, more than just a fried egg slapped on a burger... I love the creativity. Home made fries and good burgers leaves no complaint about the food. Service on the other hand left much to desire. The gentleman who took my order seemed annoyed to be at work and wanted nothing less than to be done with me as soon as possible. I work in a restaurant with a similar counter service so I understand the need to keep the line moving but I was the only one in line. I will return for the food and hope to have a different server, or maybe he will have a better day."}
{"text":"A family favorite. We take all our out of town friends and visitors here. Just wish they had the sauce in pumps!!!"}
{"text":"Good grill taste,  we'll seasoned, good consistency and nice char, coupled with a firm but pillowy not-oversized bun made this the best cheeseburger I have had in Charlotte (by far) and perhaps the best I've had anywhere. Fries being fresh cut and crispy made it the perfect well balanced indulgence. The integrity of the burger itself prevails here so the idea is to use as few toppings and sauces (ie ketchup) as necessary so that you can appreciate the quality of the burger. And it works- beautifully! Please come to South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The Service was very good.  The food was the best Burger I have ever eaten and the Onions made the meal perfect."}
{"text":"I love burgers and I eat burgers very often. But I didn't think their burger is good nor deserve 4 stars on Yelp. 


The service was really good..they are very accommodating and friendly. 

It's a self order then they bring you their food to the table. Good Casual seating. 


The food was really disappointed. 

The bun greasy and soft from the inside
The meat taste like cooking gas 
The fries  was so greasy 
Nothing I liked even the other orders my friends ordered.

I ordered bang bang burger the sauce is so sweet and the other sauce is sweet I think it's a vanilla yogurt. 



I wouldn't think I will come again and wouldn't trust Yelp unless making sure of some average reviews."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have eaten. Went with a burger with fries Gouda. Excellent beer. Fast service. Really worth the bisit"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  This is the best burger in town, and if you will believe that I'm not exaggerating, the best burger I've ever had.

The menu varies, but it does have permanent burger combinations (and a couple non-burger options).

My faves are the guacamole burger (think this is a permanent option) and the apple compote burger (relatively new).  But, seriously, any burger is going to taste fantastic.

I've had the regular fries, sweet potato fries, and house-made chips as a side, and theyre all great.  PRO TIP: get the regular potato fries and ask for the maple dipping sauce for them. The maple sauce usually comes with the sweet potato fries, but, damn, they are bangin' good with the regular fries.

Make this place a regular spot!  Actually, don't. That means I won't have to deal with a crowd ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been several times and always order the Hangover Burger with fries. Fries are seasoned nicely. No need for salt! The burger is a big, juicy mess and I love it. They serve on a wooden board which is charming. Monday's they have free side upgrades, which is great."}
{"text":"A great place for awesome burgers and sweet potato fries! Was going here once a week for a while until I got e. Coli from a medium cooked burger, it's delicious just be careful!! A locally owned place."}
{"text":"I actually did not get a burger here, but did try a slider once at a festival and it was fantastic. The menu is small (I like places that do a couple things well, instead of bunch of things mediocre - Thanks Bang Bang!) and I was just looking for a quick snack.  Their onion rings are super yummy with a nice crisp to the batter and thick cuts of tender onion.  Really hit the spot, especially paired with a cold, local beer.  Service was friendly and fast and the restaurant was clean.  The employees are quick to clear up the next table, which is great since this is a limited dining area. Parking is a B---- in this lot.  Very limited spaces and I'm told to be very cautious where you choose to park, as they definitely tow.  Oh!  Get the Bang Bang sauce.  On everything.  you're welcome ;-)"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in Charlotte! I had the Gangnam Style and it was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a kick. Not too big either. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Excellent burger! Toasted bun and patties were just the right size. The BBQ chips were awesome. Reminded me of my hometown favorites - Grippos. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in years, high quality everything. FROM THE BUN, to the fresh veggies, TO THE MOST JUICY AND TENDER MEAT. The quality of the meat is excellent, the cows are grass fed, which really makes a difference in the taste of the meat. My boyfriend had 2 BANG BANG BURGERS,which is their classic. I Had the Guacamole burger which was just delicious. Decently coming back. Also they have very high quality beers which really kicks in with the burgers."}
{"text":"Had a burger craving for weeks and knew I wanted to try this place from how great their reviews looked. So I'm sad to say I wasn't impressed. I had the guacamole burger, medium well, with fries to go. The presentation was very good, and I appreciated the ketchup and ranch being placed in separate containers. The care and attentiveness of the staff was great as well, both on the phone and in person. But, the place is difficult to get into and out of in that strip mall, and there was hardly anyone at their place. The burger wasn't as amazing as I'd been lead to believe, the patty had no flavor, the guac and ranch/onions did add an interesting flavor but not enough to hide the flavorless patty, which I guess I could understand if you don't want too much coming at you, just different tastes I guess. The fries just plain sucked, I wished I'd substituted to quinoa. Not bad if you're in the area and don't want burger chain, maybe trying one of the other burgers will be better??"}
{"text":"I was let down by my burger. I ordered the Gangnam Style burger and regular fries. For the price ($10), I expected it too be AMAZING. Not so. The patty lacked any flavor whatsoever. Also, there wasn't enough of the 'Asian\" topping - slaw, sauce and mayo - to really add any flavor to the already bland burger. That being said, the toppings were DELICIOUS and if there were more, I think it might bump the rating up a bit. 
The fries were typical, nothing to write home about. To me, this burger was not worth $10 except maybe in size. 
I would return ONLY if some friends or family wanted to come here just to be social."}
{"text":"The burger and fries are talked alot about this place so i decided to give it a try and was not dissappointed..  I got the cowboy burger with some fries and it was great.  the severs were awesome as they explained everything on the menu.  I had my food EASILY within 10 minutes, hot and fresh.  I will be going here again."}
{"text":"So my first time here and heard it about this place from my great aunt, the burgers where f***** AMAZING!!!!!! The cashier guy Devonte I think was his name was so helpful to me and my wife, he broke down the menu to us and was very informative offered a suggestion to try the burger bowl , I was a little hesitant at first only because I thought it was a bland salad but it kicked ass!!!!!! The staff and food here is off the charts hands down best burgers in Charlotte!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. Always wanted to try this place but never had time until a friend came to visit and felt like having burgers. Did not want to grill so decided to come here! great choice!"}
{"text":"We got the Cowboy Burger and the Portobella burger. My boyfriend LOVED his burger said it was delish and would eat there everyday. I was not as excited. The ingredients were fabulous and the taste was probably one of the best burgers we have had of recent. But I got the portobella burger thinking it was a portobella cap as the burger. I do not like hamburgers really and that was a slight  disappointment to realize that it was just a few mushrooms on a patty. My boyfriend gladly ate my patty. I wish we would have eaten there because our fries were cold, but that is to be expected in togo orders. The menu is extremely limited. The food is good though all in all just wish there was an actual portobella burger, not a burger with mushrooms on it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than Bad Daddy's,  but the fact of the matter is that when I took my first bites, there was not a moment when I said \"Wow, what an awesome burger!\" It was good, def better than average. Just not great."}
{"text":"If you want a quick, casual restaurant with delicious burgers, this is the spot for you. The Gangnam Style burger is my favorite - it is a Korean style pork belly with a cilantro onion slaw, soy vinaigrette and gochujang mayo. It's sweet, a little spicy, and sooo good! It doesn't feel heavy so I can eat it without feeling guilty (or super full). They also have build your own so that my fiance can eat his basic bacon chili cheeseburger. Their chips (with a light bbq seasoning) and fries are also delicious."}
{"text":"I believe Bang Bang is the best gourmet burger in Charlotte and possibly my favorite anywhere.  As an avid CrossFit athlete I get their burger bowl with an awesome burger on top of salad and fresh vegetables.  The sweet potato fries are awesome and mouth watering.  When I want to cheat, their swiss mushroom burger is out of this world.  Some time ago I met the manager to ask about their beef.  I can't remember exactly where it comes from, but there's a deep history here as well.  The taste says it all."}
{"text":"Great food. Salad was very fresh with good quality ingredients. Bbq house chips excellent. My daughter loved her grilled cheese and fries.  House ranch was very tasty. Service was great and staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Based on their $10! black bean burger... Overpriced, undercooked and bland. The fries were just grease sponges. My gfs black bean burger was just as bad. The toppings themselves were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"By far the best veggie burger in Charlotte! Amazing service and be sure to order the sweet potato fries with maple sauce! 
Also, the owner, Joe, is always there to make sure you have a great experience. The ambiance is fantastic and I hands-down vote this over my old favorite burger place in Dilworth."}
{"text":"These burgers are awesome! My nursing friends and I walk from the hospital once a month for a treat from Bang Bang. The staff is always friendly (Hey Mike!), the menu is priced well, the portions are plentiful and don't get me started on the sweet potato fries and that maple sauce! My only wish is that the smoked gouda burger was a regular on the menu, it's sooooo good; I doubt you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"The burgers at this joint are GREAT! I ordered the Guacamole Burger and the everything was cooked to perfection, down to the corn salsa! They give you a heaping portion of fries, and they're sauces are great! The maple sauce for the sweep potato fries was excellent. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere. I had the cowboy burger and my wife had the bang bang burger and we were both very pleased. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, it was pretty quiet compared to the usual burger place. The Gangnan Style burger was really good, the Korean style sliced pork went surprising well with the burger patty, it was really tender and juicy. The service was quick, I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"My meal was amazing. I got the Pimento burger, and it was actually better that at the places in Plaza-Midwood that are known for selling a similar burger. Everything was cooked perfectly and the onion rings were great. I would eat there two times a week if possible. Some may be turned away by a $9 burger but stay and eat!  Nothing was greasy which did not leave me feeling gross  or bloated or lethargic. The staff is also helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I can definitely say the Hangover burger is one of my favorites that I've ever had.  The fries are unfortunately some of the worst, they are hard and crispy and taste like hardened oil, I honestly don't even taste potato.  One of the coolest parts of the restaurant is that it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" by Guy Fieri, and right when you walk in they have a sign that says \"Guy was here\".  Overall a great burger dive but I would recommend getting something other than fries for your side."}
{"text":"Hands down, this the BEST burger place in Charlotte! The customer service is over the top and the quality of the beef is the best we've ever had. Their selection of gourmet burgers really 'wowed' us--but the meat itself is just so juicy and flavorful, keeping it simple is beautiful. 

Chef Joe makes this place awesome and we loved talking with him; he even gave us free samples of their hand-cut sweet potato fries with maple syrup/sour cream/mayo dip, and BBQ chips to try. This is the first place we'll take family and friends when they come to visit us in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite burger. I would hate to oversell this place, but my god, the quality of their burger patty is something I have never had before.

I'm typically not a big fan of burgers, because I feel like I have had every burger possible. False! This place makes burgers fresh, and you can tell. Indescribably good burgers, and their sides are great as well.

The best burger place I've found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Burger I guess. Not much better than a Big Mac. 

Service was pleasant and attentive   Food didn't arrive together. 


Not worth the cost to me."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Charlotte. Everything tastes great and is always fresh. I always get the hangover burger and it never disappoints. Their sweet potato fries are amazing and the sauce they serve with it is so tasty. Of course I always get the cheeseburger egg rolls for an appetizer, and that Bang Bang sauce is of the heavens."}
{"text":"\"Mmm this is a tasty burger\" definitely describes this place! It was our first trip to Bang Bang Burger and we were very satisfied. I went with the chicken club sandwich ( I know, when you go to a burger joint, you should go with a burger), and it might be the best d@mn chicken sandwich I've had. When given the option, I always put malt vinegar on my fries and here it was a home run (almost as good as Thrashers in Ocean City, MD)... my wife got the Gouda burger and she said it was awesome! We both look forward to our next trip to Bang Bang Burger. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"They have good $5 burgers. Problem is they charge $9 for them. Really small burger too. Good, just not worth it."}
{"text":"Was is the area this evening and decided to give Bang Bang Burger's a try.  It did not disappoint me.  Very tasty!  I ordered a Bang Bang Burger, Sweet Potato Fries and Cheeseburger Egg Roll.  My FAVORITE was the Cheeseburger Egg Roll!!!"}
{"text":"For today's review we headed south of Charlotte to the Elizabeth neighborhood. This neighborhood was named after Elizabeth College, a small Lutheran women's college founded in 1897 and is now the site of Presbyterian Hospital. Bang Bang Burgers is tucked into the back corner of the Twin Oaks Shopping Center, our second visit here. Dora here. So many cool looking restaurants in this area to tempt us along the way! 

Service was speedy. The Fried Pickles appetizer appeared within minutes. The fried pickles were worth the return visit, a combination between a dill and sweet pickle served with a homemade ranch dipping sauce, cut into spears with heavy batter. They had to be one of the best fried pickles that I have ever tried. Dora here, The Best. Fried. Pickle. Ever. Sweet and sour warred on my tongue. Why don't more places fry sweet pickles? 

My Bang Bang Burger was served with American cheese, lettuce, tomato and their famous Bangburger Sauce while the onion rings were also served with the Bangburger sauce for dipping. The burger was moist, ample size, and charred well. The onion rings were good but I preferred the Maple dipping sauce that came with my wife's sweet potatoes fries.

Dora's Cowboy Burger was served with sharp cheddar, bacon, and a smoky BBQ sauce while the sweet potatoes fries came with the lick-your-fingers-delicious maple dipping sauce. Dora here. Burgers are my go-to, and this burger was OK, not great. It was missing drip-down-your-chin juiciness. Presentation was beautiful, and the fries were sweet and moist. They would have been great on their own, but the maple dipping sauce rocketed them to awesome. 

I would rate this establishment 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's as good if not better than Bad Daddy's or any other burger place in town. 
The cowboy burger and hangover burger are amazing."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good and so cheap! Fresh ingredients and good service. Definitely gives places like five guys a run for their money."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town, and they have the award to show it! The pimento cheese here is to die for and and goes so well with with their burgers. Salmon blt was just as yummy. Can't say the same about the fries- thinking it was just a bad batch but they were literally inedible."}
{"text":"Suuuuch a good burger! And to my surprise, their gluten-free bun was really good. Like, actually good, not just good for being gluten-free. Also, the cheeseburger egg rolls were adorable and delicious."}
{"text":"There was definitely different choices than you'll find elsewhere, the only reason we tried it was because of Diners, driv-in's and dives, Guy said good things about it. The real experience though did not live up to the hype. Way too expensive , and greasy burgers and fries, I actually got sick to my stomach from the amount of grease. When you get burgers with a lot grease, that means it low quality ground beef. To spend what we spent on two burgers, two fries and two drinks, not worth it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the Seoul burger and he had their special bacon pimento cheese stuffed jalapeño burger.  He also got the sweet potato fries with maple sauce.  Everything was delicious, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  Staff was super friendly and they had a great selection of local beers.  Can't wait to come back and try the pimento burger!"}
{"text":"Wish it were closer. Stopped here tonight for dinner with the family. Everyone loved it. I had the bang bang, my son the cowboy, wife had a burger bowl with the upgraded grass fed beef and daughter had the cheeseburger egg roll. We had BBQ chips as an appie. All aound solid. Good local beers too. I am a medium rare guy and was at first disappointed when they said medium was a low as they could go. I asked for as close as I could get to medium rare. Gotta tell you, they got close. Juicy, reddish, and tasty. Fries were excellent. Bang bang sauce is like a spicier Russian dressing. If you aren't a kid person, avoid Tuesday as it is kids eat free night. We didn't know and just stumbled into it. Eorkwd out well since my faughter ate free!  Would go back, and recommend to anyone in a heart beat."}
{"text":"If you are really hungry get the double-stack, if not go with the single or you will be taking home half your burger.  Burgers are good though on the pricy side.  I do wish I would have seen the chalkboard when I went there with the kids, as I would have really liked to try one of the other burgers.  But no worries, we will be back."}
{"text":"Every single time that I've been to Bang Bang Burger it hasn't fell short of delicious. The Hangover Burger is by far the best burger that I have ever eaten and the sweet potato fries make a great compliment. If you're ever in Charlotte, it is a MUST. Support local!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Very low key and friendly. Fantastic gluten free buns I swore were not. Sweet potato fries were delicious too."}
{"text":"I ordered a Cowboy burger on a gluten free bun with garlic broccoli and I thought it was great. My mother ordered a Bang Bang burger and loved it too. This is definitely a place I'd try again."}
{"text":"Vinimos en familia desde miami . Déjenme decirles que es una de las mejores hamburguesas que me he comido . Divinas .
Pedimos la seoul 2.0, hangover, cowboy.
Para mí las más ricas la cowboy con las cebollas en aros .. y la hangover. Se lo recomiendo a todos a parte tienen cervezas artesanales divinas ."}
{"text":"The burgers here are the best in Charlotte. My favorite is the Guacamole Burger with the sweet potato fries. There black bean burger is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My girlfriend took me and said it was one of her favorites. The burger was decent...though the patties were nothing special and were kind thin. The bacon was really good. Nice and crispy. The BBQ sauce was meh. What really brought it down to 2 stars for me from 3 were the fries. They tasted really off. Like cleaning supplies almost. Very unappetizing."}
{"text":"Exactly what i expected from a 4.5 rated place. Burgers ranged from 8.5-10 for single quarter pound varieties and 12-13 for double patties. The beef and portions were great and I didn't feel too gross after the meal.

The hand cut fries were generously served and hit the spot. Also the potato chips were the best I've had, and incredibly thin.

If anything the burgers may be a little small if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Don't order online! I ordered and paid for my order online. Once I arrived my order was ready but they said they didn't receive my payment even though the money was taken out of my account. They then informed me that they \"didn't know where the money goes to\" even though I ordered online directly from their yelp account. I have have done this MANY times at many different restaurants in the area and have NEVER had an issue. After going back and forth one of the employees I had to pay for my order once AGAIN. Both payments were taken out of my account. The burger was decent, but not for 24 dollars. Not sure if I'll be back. 

It appears that they took down the online ordering link since that encounter , but I feel that nothing was done on their end to address my issue."}
{"text":"Really a very fast and delicious option.  I went with their run of the mill burger more or less but am excited to try some of the more exotic options on my return.  Superb food, prompt service, nice clean restaurant, everything I expected!"}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend for dinner after work. The lady who took our orders was very informative and friendly. I ordered the \"Gangnam Style\" burger and it came with a side of fries. Burger was juicy and the flavors were on point, but kinda small and needed more veggies or toppings. The fries was perfectly seasoned and crispy. They also sell local beer there which was an extra plus. Kind of on the expensive side for a burger and Noda beer it costed me almost $18 bucks."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good veggie burger in Charlotte that didn't come directly from some freezer box they bought at the grocery store, and I finally found one.  Well done Bang Bang Burgers!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. Great, unique burgers  and awesome fries"}
{"text":"I really wish we could do 1/2 stars.
The burgers we very good. we both really enjoyed both the mushroom swiss (her), and the Gangnam style (me). The burger itself had great beef flavor, something that seems hard to find lately, and was cooked perfectly.
The Gangnam was not spicy, even though the menu said it was. Actually, no heat at all!
The sweet potato fries were good also. The only complaint is that we felt it was a bit pricey for the size of the burger."}
{"text":"Try the Bang Bang Burger with a small Patty with cheese with fries. The burger was very average and no way the price worth it. Brooks burger is just as good but better consider the cost"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty burger!  The beef comes from Pat LaFreida, possibly the most famous butcher in America.  The burger itself is very well seasoned and was cooked perfectly to the requested temp - medium well.  I had the special of the day, the Carolina Panthers Burger, which was topped with sharp cheddar, pulled pork, BBQ sauce, coleslaw, and fried onion strings.  Each component was done well on its own. My wife even commented about how good the bun was.

The french fries were also fantastic!  I hate undercooked, soggy fries and these were thankfully the complete opposite.  There are few things better than a perfectly crispy french fry.

The restaurant is smaller than it should be.  It's a fast-casual setup, but maybe a little too casual. The back hallway was crammed full of supply shelves but they were tastefully covered by black curtains. The men's room also seems to serve as a storage space. There were CO2 tanks, a ladder, and other similar accoutrements.  I understand the need to store these things in plain sight but it will be nice to see this place at its full potential in a proper restaurant space one day."}
{"text":"\"GREAT burger but overpriced for a small portion. Load up on the side of fries if you're looking to be full(er). 5-star for flavor, 3-star for price to portion\" 

You order at the counter and there are a variety of burger options (for vegetarians and omnivores) although some additional toppings are limited for vegetarians (i.e. The Seoul burger which has bacon fries kimchi and no option to remove the bacon). I got the Quinoa Black Bean Veggie Burger with a side of the Quinoa salad. 

Everything about the burger is amazing. The sauce is on point with the cheese and the sweetened pickles adds a nice flavor to it. The BUN is the best part! It's so soft and fluffy. No complaints at all on how it tasted. Not too salty either. 

I'd say the only downside is that for $9.5 you get a burger the size of your fist. It's small...and at Cowbells you can definitely get larger portions for about the same price. I'm not sure why it's that expensive for a veggie burger (not using organic ingredients either) but would consider lowering the price. I hesitate on giving it a 4-star because it's just so good. 5-star for the flavor, 3-star for the price to portion ratio."}
{"text":"I debated giving Bang Bang Burgers five stars, but I think there's a bit of grade inflation on Yelp. Okay, there's a LOT of grade inflation on YELP. Let's say it's a solid four and a half stars. Since it was my first time, I ordered the Bang Bang burger cooked medium. It was tasty and their special sauce is, well, special. The hand cut fries were excellent. Service with a smile and a fair price. If I could give four and two-thirds stars, I would. I'll definitely go back. Maybe after sampling some of their other burgers, I'll add another star."}
{"text":"Our favorite burger place in Charlotte, and it's not even close.

A fantastic regular menu, with the options of gluten free buns for you gluten free people and grass fed beef options as well.

Get the sweet potato fries! They are tremendous. 

Thumbs up to these guys for their weekly specials. Not only are they creative and almost always home runs, but they release a detailed video on facebook with a nice production value to boot."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Burgers is SO yummy! I love that it's so close to our house in Elizabeth. The burger bowl is delicious, really everything is! We have been here at least a dozen times and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"The meat is the star!!...amazing burgers high quality ingredients, and all of the sides are amazing!!...Top 5 burgers in Charlotte without a doubt!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! My food was delicious. I got the chicken sandwich it was fresh, and they were sure to not put on the toppings I requested off. My sister got a guacamole burger and loved it. The burgers comes medium cooked so be sure to ask how you want it done. The sauces also complemented all the sides perfectly. The seating is first come first serve, and you must order before sitting. However, there were plenty of seats available."}
{"text":"It was delicious! I got the grilled salmon burger with sweet potato fries and maple dipping sauce. The sandwich was perfect and large, and the sweet potato fries were tasty and a generously sized portion. The maple sauce was fantastic as well. It is a little pricy for a burger restaurant, but it was worth it. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. Highly suggest the hangover. Good people, good beer, and the best bread"}
{"text":"Gangnam style burger is incredible - ask for it well done.  Gochujang Mayo is amazing (ask for extra so you can dip your fries). The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is sometimes the pork belly on top is under cooked, much better when it's crispy!  Also, it's kind of a buzzkill when you hafta pay for extra condiments which make the meal you're paying for better.  If a burger with a tiny bit of Gochujang mayo versus one with a decent amount makes the burger that much better you shouldn't have to pay extra."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a burger in Charlotte!! Everything is fresh, full of flavor and for great prices! I like to try different and creative burgers. This place has a variety of not your everyday burger and I love it!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what folks consider a good burger but we went based on these reviews and all I can say is What??! 
Supposedly a specialty burger place should not serve frozen \"meat\" patties the size of a sausage on a massive dry bun. We were surprised to see thin little thing we could buy at local store. 

Sure the presentation was cute with fries in basket and paper & if you like drowning your burger in \"hip\" toppings, then great. But if you want a good burger with real, hamburger, keep it moving! Didn't even have mustard except mismatched packet of Frenchs and Heinz. 

That's not to mention the strange service from a little hairy guy who forgot our drinks when we went to table...or all kinds of personnel rambling in and out of kitchen and sitting around. Really don't want to see food handlers roaming about in and out.

You guys go ahead and have at it; we will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Charlotte. The service is quick and friendly, the food is delicious, and the presentation looks great. They use good quality beef which makes for a fresh, juicy burger and the bun and toppings are also good quality and just right. The handcut fries are great too. This place nails it."}
{"text":"Homemade goodness in the gangnum style burger! It is a savory combo of pork belly and burger, very filling! The sauce was just a tad spicy and the flavor enhanced them. I got the sauce on the side and added it as I wished. The sweet potato fries were good but needed salt. I liked the flavor of the burger and the staff was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at bang bang ever since the \"coming soon\" sign was hanging! I read some awesome reviews and it was set in my mind that I just had to try it! 
Today I killed the curiosity and decided to go in- I ended up ordering the bang bang burger. Let's just say it wasn't what I expected.  It was good, I love that it's grass fed beef and all but flavor was really lacking with this one.  I didnt look into what bang bang sauce was, but its thousand island dressing..... not even what I imagined! I would've told them to hold that mess! 
I'm also going to agree with a few others and say that a lot of bread comes with this smaller portioned burger patty.  
It was sort of slow while I was there-  so maybe that explains the boring attitudes from the workers, the cashier was friendly though! 
Im not rushing back,  slightly disappointed :("}
{"text":"My husband and I just are there (TNT Burger & Cowboy Burger) and it was amazing! The meat was cooked perfectly, the bun was soft and the fries were *amazing* Their presentation was great too! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"After seeing Bang Bang Burgers on Drive-ins, Diners and Dives, I decided to give this place a try. I brought along a friend, another burger junkie, to get his opinion also. I ordered the Pimento Burger, he ordered the Bang Bang Burger. We both ordered their advertised \"fresh cut fries\". I'm a huge french fry junkie and never pass up an opportunity for fresh-cut. 

The service was friendly and the we waited less than 10 minutes to get our order. The burgers were very good. The buns were awesome. The 3 star rating is from the awful fries. They may be fresh cut but they just weren't the type of fresh cut that appealed to me. Apparently they use some type of batter that makes a thick coating on the fry making them too crunchy for my liking. There was no potatoey taste.I could only eat a few. Now, many people may like that \"style\" of fry but imo, Arby's has better fries than this place. When I think of fresh cut fries, I think of Five Guys, Thomas St Tavern and a handful of others that I like.

I plan to revisit BBB but next time I will get the Onion Rings. They looked better."}
{"text":"Right now, at this point in time, this might be one of my favorite burgers in Charlotte. I hesitate writing that as I live for burgers but this place really made an impression on me. To start, the lady that took my order was incredibly helpful, and that pleased me. I must have looked confused because she chimed in with some of her favorites, some great options, or letting me know that I can create my own. So, thats what I did. 

I created and ordered a double, bacon, swiss, avocado, and mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. As I read on the menu, and what struck my fancy, is that the burger meat is from the \"highest quality, Black Angus whole muscle cuts of short rib & chuck, produced by NYC's own Pat La Frieda!\" I like that they are conscious of the meat they are using. I don't know if it's where the meat came from or what, but it was delicious. It was very very juicy and flavorful and I had a hard time putting it down and breathing during my bites. Also, I liked the toasted bun and the fries were so good, not soggy or cold and the perfect compliment. 

The amount of food was more than decent and the presentation of the food was cute with the little cutting board and basket of fries. It also came with the 'bang bang' sauce, which I didn't use on my burger but did dip some of my fries in it and it was good but I wouldn't want to take away from the burger by using it too much or pouring it on top. 

The other menu options look pretty tasty, I have to try the pork belly burger, and the other specialty burgers all look appetizing. I will say, food and service is a 5 for me but the place itself is probably a 4. It's on the smaller side and is an order upfront, get your drink, sit down and then they bring it to you, smashbruger, type set up - but smaller. When I've gone there were only a few people and still felt myself having to consciously maneuver around, so I could only imagine how it would be with just a few more people. If you like burgers, this is a place to go!!"}
{"text":"GREAT SPECIALITY BURGERS. They have some amazing burgers. I got the special which was a artichoke burger. It was great. I got mine cooked medium which actually turned out to be medium rare which was fine for me but needs to be noted. The atmosphere was great but I can see searching being a problem."}
{"text":"This is my third visit. Location is very busy and could use more seating. I saw more than one party leave because there was not enough seating at the time they arrived. Burgers are great, fries are even better. Lots of good local beers too! Get here early to get a table for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Great Tasty Burger!!!  Different and interesting topping combinations, toppings/sides that really take your taste buds on a delicious trip.  I got the Hangover Burger.  Could not say one bad thing about it, and it was so good I ate the onions which I have always taken off on other burgers.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. The fries and bun deserve one full star alone. 

I am still in search of the perfect chargrilled burger. Bang Bang was recommend...so I thought I would give it a go (again).

The customer service was great, especially considering that we arrived less than an hour before closing. The cashier encouraged us to take our time and dine in.

I ordered the Bang Bang burger sans tomato and lettuce...well done. When my burger arrived quickly I wanted to believe it was due to great service. So, here's where it gets tricky. I fully understand that a burger cooked to an internal temp of 160 is considered well done, even if it's still pink. Ugh, I know that, but I am not a fan of it. I get it. It's angus beef and you don't want to overcook it. Yet, there's something about the \"a little too pink\" patty that gets me every time. 

However, the fries were perfect...really perfect. The bun from was a great pair, which was from Duke's Breads. And, they serve Fanta (while I'm not a fan of the history of this drink it is delicious). 

I'm still in search of the perfect chargrilled, but Bang Bang definitely provides a few things that invite me to return."}
{"text":"Success has changed you, old friend. I've been going to bang bang burgers for quite some time now so I've tried just about all they have to offer. But lately something is different with the burgers. They're not cooked the same, the meat doesn't taste the same. I truly believe they have changed their source to lower quality to handle the higher demand they've received recently. This use to be one of the best burger spots in town now I rank it close to the bottom and after my last 3 disappointing visits I'll sadly say I won't ever be going back. I'd truly rather a Wendy's burger over this now which is as sad as it sounds. You used to be great, what happened?"}
{"text":"Service was great. The girl at the register was very nice. Food was amazing. I'm not much of a burger fan but I had the cowboy and it was delicious. The bun was delicious the bacon was cooked perfectly. The onion rings made it complete. My hubby got the hangover. He said it was perfectly cooked and tasty. He loved the bang bang sauce. Definitely will recommend anyone should stop by"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely AMAZING!!!! I had the Salmon Club with fries and Bang-sauce. It's a cool place to grab dinner with your friends or family. Very open space and lots of seating."}
{"text":"Place has so many great reviews, I had to see what it was all about. I had the standard burger. Very good! Fries are tasty too! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Burgers are delicious.

That sauce is the nectar of the gods.

My only qualm is - if you're going to charge like $10 for a burger, I feel like it should feel more sit-downy.  

But, hey. Overhead's a b***h.

Do your thang bang bang."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Burgers seems to be a hidden little gem. It's a shame that more people don't know about this place! The burgers are unique and damn delicious and the staff is super friendly. 

So far I've had the TNT burger and Apple Compote burger (which is now my new fave!) The Apple Compote has an awesome blend of flavors including Apple compote, creamy cow's milk cheese and bacon jam. Yes. Bacon jam. To die for. And every burger I've had has been cooked to temp; never overlooked. Bonus: The homemade fries are also pretty dang good too. 

I promise if you try Bang Bang, you'll be adding this place to your list of trusty burger joints in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, cool people, and I loved my burger! Did not like the fries or sweet potato fries. Only reason it was not 5 stars. The burger had great flavor - I had the TNT - and I liked the setup. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Good service. Will be back to check out the pork belly burger. Definitely go for the double burger if you're a dude. Homemade pickles are good, on the sweeter side though."}
{"text":"Updated: I went in craving a burger and this was amazing!

Ok, so I am not a HUGE burger fan so this place probably wasn't going to get 5 stars out of me. But for what it was, I enjoyed it. And I think my husband was in pure burger heaven. 1 serving of fries was enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger what a surprise, and where very pleased. The fries are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  From the customer service to the food, everything was excellent.  We were treated so nicely by the various employees we came in contact with.  Upon telling them it was our first time, they were excited to recommend various items and explain the menu.  While waiting for our food, the cashier brought us out sampler chips just because.  After the short wait for our food, we were once again happy about the delicious food.  I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the TNT (single) with sweet potato fries, my wife ordered the Hangover with sweet potato fries. Flavors were on point, juicy, great grilled flavor, cooked medium just like we ordered. You can tell the it is quality meat. Fresh brioche bun was excellent as well. Toppings were good, cooked properly, but the small quantity reduces the amount of flavor they add to burger. Sweet potato fries were tasty, they come with maple sauce that looks like marshmallow fluff. Fries could have been a little more crispy, sauces were great ( we ordered an extra side of chipotle ranch as well).

Service was good, food was prepared quickly. Place was about 1/3 full. Several people sitting and handful were in and out getting to go orders.

My one qualm was the size. The burgers are not that big. For $10-12ish dollars for a single patty (add $1-2 surcharge depending on what side you get) I wasn't really full. I'm sure the double patty would take care of that, but it cost 3 bucks more.

Bottom line, one of best burger patties I've ever hard, solid toppings, great bun, ok value due to size of burger and small amount of toppings. We will go back, but I still give Bad Daddy's the edge."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Loyal to local breweries. My favorite is the standard Bang Bang burger. The sauce is delicious and the fries are amounts my favorites."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much that I went twice in one weekend. The bean burger was the best I have ever had. The fresh cut fries were an added surprise that made the overall meal amazing. I love the special toppings that are on the burgers too. Will be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Two stars because it was not as advertised.   The burger patties are the size of Burger King's.  They are not grass fed beef so you can only cook them medium.   And, they are small.  My bread was also dry.  The pictures and descriptions of the sides are also deceiving.   The edamame side is mostly sweet potato.   The picture shows mostly edamame.  Not the best burger in Charlotte.  No wine.  Some beer.  No waitress.   It's a fast food joint."}
{"text":"A better than average burger joint- had the Apple compote burger which was unique and tasty. I had the bbq chips, which were nothing special. Total was about $12. As good as it was, I think I'll be going to Five Guys/Smash Burger for an equally good burger at a much better price."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for lunch! BEST BURGER EVER! It was soooo freaking delicious and the service was so fast! We ordered the double Bang Bang burger all the way and when I saw I will be back again very soon! I mean that! I thought Smashburger was the best but this right here beats it! Great food!"}
{"text":"We used to be Bang Bang regulars so this is a sad thing to write but recently the quality has tanked. Seeing our local place getting recognition on a TV show made me so happy at first but I guess it has its downsides.

The burger patties are much smaller.
The menu has changed to be more expensive (fries no longer included) 
A few old fav burgers are just gone

Twice in a row we got UNCOOKED fries. Not just soft, I mean literally inedible. Made me sad because I love their fries. 

The uncooked fry experience was just super gross. Not sure if we will go back for a third try which is a shame because this place was great."}
{"text":"This is a very casual eatery. Order up front and sit down at a table with a number. My husband got the gangnam burger which was pretty good. Whatever sauce they had on it was flavored well. I got the mushroom and onions which fell a little flat. Not too flavorful and overall pretty greasy. Our 15 month old did love her grilled cheese sandwich but I felt like that was pretty greasy and a little overly burnt. And there were a few flies hovering around and some mustiness to the air. I suppose for the type of place it is I shouldn't expect that much. The servers were friendly and everything did come out promptly."}
{"text":"I am in love!! Basically shake shack in Charlotte. Well, minus the shakes. 

Today was the 2nd time eating from this place. First time was takeout that the hubs picked up. And there it was, my delicious shake shack type burger made with Pat Lafrida beef!!! 

Today when a co-worker and I were talking about where to grab lunch I quickly thought of this place and off we went. 

We were greeted by a super enthusiastic employee who explained all the menu (wish I could remember his name!), the beef and the general awesomeness that is this place! 

I ordered the hangover burger and it truly was burger perfection. We had a little issue with the ketchup bottle exploding all over the table and the same employee as above quickly helped clean it up and then the owner came over to make sure we were ok and we started talking. 

He was so passionate about his business that even if the food wasn't to die for I would go back just to support him! But that won't be an issue sine I'll be back again and again since the food is bangin'! (Sorry- I couldn't resist)."}
{"text":"Had a bang bang burger, fries, and a beer.  It was everything I hoped it could be, and more.  Burger was done to my liking, and the homemade roll was fantastic."}
{"text":"Get the grass-fed beef upgrade!  It's worth it.  Very reasonably sized burgers.  Fries come fresh cooked wrapped in paper.  

Like Five Guys but higher end and not as big.  Trying to keep them top of memory for when I want my next burger fix!

Warning: the booth in the far corner is stupid cold!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. Went for the first time today after hearing all the hype and it lived up to it. Service was great and the food was incredible. This will be my new go to burger place"}
{"text":"Its a really good burger. We had  a few choices in the area and decided on the Bang Bang Burger. I thought it  was pretty good, Nina got the  hangover burger  it look good but a little too much for me. Stop on by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to try this place out on a particularly icky rainy Sunday afternoon. Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. 

We tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.). 

So final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff! salmon burger and the sweet potatoe fries with maple sauce was delicious! Salmon was fresh, juicy and flavorful.  In my opinion this place is better than big daddy's.  Im looking forward to going back to try the veggie burger!"}
{"text":"The customer service was fantastic and the sweet potato fries all on there own were delicious. I thought he burger was average, I ordered the Cowboy.  I did not really understand the Maple sauce. I saw a review that said the Maple sauce was a must with the Sweet potato fries so I ordered it. It looked like maple syrup but tasted nothing like Maple it was runny and had very little flavor. But again I would like to emphasize the customer service, great people good fries, average burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally made it for lunch. Actually this was my 40th bday lunch as well. She got the original Bang Bang with the sweet potato fries and loved it. I had the Cowboy burger with regular fries. The BBQ sauce for the burger (served on the side so you can control the amount) was truly amazing. The burger was delicious. I saw they have 1/2 off local beer on Wednesdays so I plan to come for that soon. The ONLY negative mark is that it is a little bit pricey. However as hard as it is to find a good burger that's ok."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Used to love this place, but haven't been back in a while, and in the time that's passed, they changed their menu and now it's just like other random burger places. The green beans, salads and delicious homemade potato chips and homemade ranch are gone, and the prices are higher. It's way too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite burger spot to stop in and get something quick! They have recently changed their blue cheese crumbles into and blue cheese sheet. Or some type of fancy blue cheese. But I don't like it and it has completely ruined my normal go to spot. This is still an awesome burger spot as long as they have all the same ingredients on the burgers that you like I would suggest them. But for me unfortunately it's just not the same. Hopefully they bring back the crumble"}
{"text":"I will definitely return. Well organized, relatively friendly staff and good burgers. I like my burgers thicker than their standard offering (yes I know I can order a double) but the overall results was very good. Good fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"I love this place so I'll give them 5 stars, but I'm super bummed because the only reason I love this place was for the Seoul and Gangnam style burger which are no longer on the menu. Please bring it back!!"}
{"text":"We really didn't like this place. I had a salad with a patty thrown on top. And it was the driest hamburger I've ever had. My Love had a burger and he also wasn't impressed. I'm trying to figure out what we missed."}
{"text":"Took a friend visiting from out of town here. Burgers were better than 5 guys which we love. So juicy and flavorful. It's a small place so expect to wait for a table but it's worth it. Gluten free buns get 5 stars as well. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Burgers done right. Definitely not your McDonalds. No waiter/waitress order at counter and they bring it to you."}
{"text":"Awesome! Too funny. Saw this place on DDD rerun last night and knew I would be in Charlotte today (I live in Ohio) so checked it out for lunch. Arrived around 12:15 pm and plenty of seats (it did fill up pretty quick) You order what you want at the counter and they deliver to your table. Seating for about 50. Booths, tables and TV's on the walls. They brought us home made potato chips and sauce which was very tasty. This is a burger place. If you love burgers like I do, you will be very satisfied. Food was perfect and delivered as ordered in about 5 minutes. So glad I got a chance to check it out. Deserves 5 stars as I couldn't really find any fault but holding out to make sure they don't forget what made them so good."}
{"text":"Great fresh burgers! The fries are delicious, and I highly suggest you try their different dipping sauces. No matter which burger you order, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Loved it.  I had the Korean pork belly burger.  It was excellent.  The sauce they have on it has a little spice.  Very busy in here and you can see why.  Constructive now - I think the bathrooms could need some attention, floor not very nice and hole in the wall in the men's bathroom.  Other than that I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I'm a tough burger critic...and I love this place! Delicious, juicy, fresh-tasting burgers...fantastic fries...great prices and fun atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had! Very juicy and flavorful! Had the bang bang burger with bacon. Can't wait to try other ones out."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Burgers is a great place for a good lunch in a busy area. I ordered the TNT burger and subbed the beef for grilled chicken. The chicken was fresh and juicy and everything was flavorful. The fries came out hot crispy and had just the right amount of salt. The restaurant is small and parking can be a hassle but it's worth it. I'd like to compare Bang Bang to a smaller less expensive Bad Daddy's."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time! Had the California chicken burger. If you like sauces you MUST try the bang sauce! I loved it with my fries! 

Tried hubby's hangover burger. Good stuff! I'm not a fan of ground beef but I really enjoyed this one. As for the patty size he was fine because he got the double but might have been different if he ordered the single. 

For all the mommas - this is a family friendly place without feeling like you're at Steak 'n Shake. Reasonable prices and great quality!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This was an awesome burger joint!! Great burger. Comes with a generous portion of fries and their signature bang burger sauce!! Was very yummy. Definitely will return!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome choices of burgers.Loved their TNT and the onion rings are so crispy and thin unlike the drippy oil versions at other places.Definitely visiting again."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I want to have a really good burger.  I tried a few of their other style burgers, but by far my favorite is the Gangnam Style burger. Its beef patty and Korean Style pork belly and a few other deliciousness..sooooo good.  The fries are delicious as well, a large portion.  One of Charlotte's best."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Stumbled upon when we were in the area searching for a new apartment. We loved it. Sooo good. Great quality, great price. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!! Burger was the best I. HAVE had in Charlotte.
The home made BBQ chips were very unique. The homemade ranch dressing was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the burgers are great, service was excellent and prices reasonable.  I love how they serve the burgers on the butcher board.  Great burger place in a sea of burger joints."}
{"text":"A+ Food Presentation

So I came back with the rest of my family a few weeks later. We tried the Pimento Burger, Onion Rings, and their special Mac and Cheese W/ Bacon Burger OH- Muh- God  
A++++++ Mac n cheese Bacon burger Jesus! That needs to be a regular on the menu I'm sorry it's too good. 
C+ on the onion rings eh? I didn't care for the batter it was too doughy. 
B+  Pimento Burger unless ur a die hard Pimento lover it might be too much for u. 
Still over all restaurant gets an A"}
{"text":"Perfect burgers when you're looking for classic comfort food! Would definitely recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Thought it was an awesome burger but .... For around 10 bucks the bun ate up the small burger.... I think you can upsize the portion of beef, but I just won't pay 12 bucks for a burger"}
{"text":"Had the Pork Belly burger. It was really fatty. Also had the garlic broccoli.  That was a bit bland."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I love this place. Best burgers in Charlotte. The burger with the egg on it has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Got a quick take-out for an evening when there just wasn't time to cook and so glad we did! I got the Cowboy Burger, cooked EXACTLY as ordered, and so full of flavor! The grilled onions were cooked to perfection, the cheddar was melted and flavorful. My dinner companion chose the pimiento on a black bean burger and was not disappointed! The french fries were cooked exactly like I like them, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, seasoned just right, and the quinoa salad made me smile from ear to ear! I could eat a bowlful of that salad every day! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, and explained the pricing and menu very well.  Burger was mediocre.  I asked for medium, and it was cooked a little more than that.  For a place specializing in \"high end\" burgers, I would have expected hand made patties, not prepackaged.  The onion rings were doughy, reminiscent of funnel cake.  The fries were outstanding.  They need to hide there supplies a little better.  The hallway to the restrooms, and the men's restroom were lined with wire shelving, I felt like I was in a supply room while I was using the restroom."}
{"text":"Every time we're in the area we have to stop in. Their burgers are the best around. Highly recommend this place if you want a great burger cooked the way you want it plus friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"Let me start with - the burgers were very good. Then let me say - the service was VERY slow. We arrived at approx 8 pm and immediately ordered. This is an order at the counter, take a number to your table and they bring out the food place...eventually. The place was busy and we essentially got the last table that was immediately available but it is not a large place. Then we waited and waited.  We noted lots of other tables waiting too... The food seemed to come out in sporadic little clumps. We noted other tables would get an entree then a few minutes later another entree would arrive. After about 30 minutes a burger arrived for my husband and then about 5 minutes later my burger arrived... A bit odd. We didn't special order anything and it was burgers so I'm not exactly sure what took so long. I had the pimento burger and fries and my husband had the TNT burger and BBQ chips.  All was very tasty and fresh. Another odd thing was the \"plates\". The burgers are served on a cutting board with the fries/chips in a metal fryer style basket...this was awkward for the servers to carry and also on the table. Would I eat here again...yes. Would I ever eat lunch here...not it I only had an hour!"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious and a good price. The bag bang sauce is great, ask for an extra side for your fries. The restaurant is fast casual and very clean"}
{"text":"Deliciosas hamburguesas! Las papas ala francesa  o chips cualquiera de las dos son buenisimaaaaaaaas!!"}
{"text":"There was so much hype for the burgers here. And I hate to say it but the burgers were good but not amazing. 

I got the hangover cure and the pimento burger which both were good burgers but it was nothing short of a a chain like shake shack."}
{"text":"First ever 5 star experience. I apologize that I did not get the gentleman's name but he was outstanding \"White Glove Service\". Greeted us the second we arrived with a nice smile took his time explaining in extensive details the highlights and specials they are known for. I order the Hangover and my wife ordered The Bleu. Both were full of flavor as you can taste the quality of meat that was used. Each of the burgers had their own unique taste while not drowning the taste of high quality beef. The burgers were prepared perfectly cooked Medium.  We also ordered the cheeseburger egg roll which was amazing. While we waited the same cashier came over and give us a sample of the BBQ chips. The food came out quite fast as everything there is cook to order. Before you say it yes; there are a ton of burger places, but what makes this place stand out is food quality, taste, and service. 

A must to try if you are a foodie."}
{"text":"Love the food, best cashier's i have ever encountered, also been coming since they first open and seeing them blowup huge on TV means somebody over there is doing something right, don't change Bang !"}
{"text":"Food is good but I'm not a fan of standing in line to order my lunch. Have only been there twice and had their bang bang burger which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Came to check out what all the buzz is aboot. So when trying spring new I try and keep to the basics being that it's a burger joint and I'm assuming the basics should be the best! I had the bacon cheese burger and my wife tried the the salmon burger bowl. Let's start off by saying the bacon tasted old! As if it were sitting there since they opened up this morning \" hoping it's not an old batch from last night \" which is why I gave this place 3 stars. The burger meat and cheese tasted fresh and was good! I personally love fries and these fries were awesome! They reminded me of 5 guys burger fries. Now for the salmon , it did taste fresh but in my opinion lacked some flavor not much cause the salad dressing gave it some kick. A bit too oily for my blood but passable. $10 for a bacon cheese burger , $14 for the salmon burger bowl. Most likely will not be passing by again. I can go to 5 guys burger and get a bigger burger for the same price!"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed about how many times i've driven past Bang Bang Burgers on my way home from work without ever stopping in. Finally, after seeing an instagram drool-worthy picture of one of their special burgers, I decided my time was up. 

Situated in a small strip of retail off of pecan, the store front is unassuming. Inside, a menu and order counter greets you with specials and their classic burgers. The food took a little longer to come out than we may have initially anticipated (especially considering there were only 2 other people in the dining room). The burger itself was flavorful, but the french fries weren't much to write home about. 

There are many places to grab burgers in Plaza/Elizabeth, but Bang Bang will now get put into the rotation of nearby favorites."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, not too big, just plain good. They also have a burger bowl salad, that you can get with either a burger, chicken or salmon, which is excellent. HOWEVER, the booths are so bad, so uncomfortable, the seat cushions are angled so they almost tip you off the front. The seating is so bad, I'm knocking a couple of stars off my score."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. I had the Pork Belly burger. My wife had the guacamole burger. The boys had kids burger, Western, Bang Bang. 5 smiles. Winner. But mine was the best. :)"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!!! No seriously these cows are The Holy Grail. Possibly the best burger I've ever had. These burgers are unbelievable magically succulent. I will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burger! I had the hungover! Delicious! Ask for well done and it was slightly pink."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and sides! Great countermand - very helpful and informative. Sauces were excellent. Quality and service were great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the jalapeño pimento cheese burger and it was OK,nothing really special though. The fries were a bit over cooked and I did not enjoy them."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but nothing you haven't had before.

You want a burger with bacon, avocado, and sun dried tomatoes? Sure, they've got it. You want a sunny side egg on top with onion straws and ham? Yep, they got that too. I'm more of a burger \"naturalist\" meaning that I appreciate something that's simple and a burger that's much more than just throwing 5 weird toppings on it; hold all of the extra shit, it's unnecessary. 

The fries are good, but nothing groundbreaking and it's nice that they have a few draft beers to choose from. This is a counter-order style restaurant, so it's fast and casual. In addition to being casual, it's extremely crowded on the inside with tables stacked on top of each other. It's also not the cheapest with each burger costing around $10 and doesn't include fries or a drink. Plan on dropping $15/person.   

While it's a good burger spot, it fails to really stand out among other establishments such as American Burger Co. and Cowbell. A solid 3/5...You won't be disappointed, but you also won't be blown away."}
{"text":"The burgers here did not disappoint... The food is 5 stars. We had a Bang Bang with house made fries and a TNT with quinoa salad. All absolutely delicious. Cooked to perfection on soft buttery brioche buns.  Bang Bang sauce is like a gourmet version of \"secret sauce\". Fast casual setup; order at the counter and take a seat. Good local, but limited beer selections.  The place itself is nothing fancy, simple booths, random background music... No atmosphere at all really.  But that's not a reason to dine somewhere anyway. The price point is perfect. Will definitely be back for more burgers!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint.  The custom selection of burgers gives everyone a chance to get what they want.  The \"Hangover\" was delicious and I recommend it to anyone.  Beer was cold and the staff awesome!   A must in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Bang Bang Burgers is the best place in Charlotte to get burgers. Unique burgers with a weekly special burger that isn't on the menu. Definitely a place to try and very spacious shop within a small plaza located on 7th Street near the hospital. Fries are on point and burger cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely incredible and delicious!!!
Stopped in before the Oct 7 Ron White show.  Luckily, we beat a big crowd.  The service was fantastic and to our liking, really fast.  If you like high quality, custom cooked burgers that are perfectly balanced with toppings and some seriously tasty fries, this is the place.
I am a burger fanatic and this is one of the best I have had in the U.S. 
I would rank it as a, \"Must Try!\" if you are in the Charlotte area!!

We cannot wait to try each item on the menu, and we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The \"opening soon\" sign has finally come down, but I foresee a closed sign within the year.  For a burger joint, bang bang fails to bring flavor or quality.  The burgers are pre-made frozen cuts with \"hand cut\" fries that taste less than fresh.  I had a side of the bang bang sauce house homemade dressing....it's 1000 island made from canned \"fresh\" ingredients.   

Overall, everything was a let down and over priced for what it was."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the 7th St area and are so happy we discovered Bang Bang Burgers!  Always get the double and share, it's just better!  Pork Belly and Port/Mushroom are heavenly.  Crispy delicious fries.  Love the grilled chicken sandwich too.  Great staff, especially Mike and service is fast and friendly.  Small place but  we get it to go a lot and it takes home great."}
{"text":"I will honestly say Bang Bang is one of the best Hamburger places in the U.S. This place is awesome and if your in the area you need to make it a must stop."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious burgers. Although a bit pricey, the food is great and it's nice that the beef is halal-processed/Halal-certified. They've also upped the ante by using actual onion strings instead of onion rings on their burger. 

Only reason I can't give it a five star rating is because of the fries. They were pretty stale/tough and not exactly fresh in my opinion. 

My favorite: Double TNT burger with sautéed onions."}
{"text":"This was well worth the 5 hour drive and traffic from Norfolk, va. We are headed to Florida and we plan on coming back on the way home! This food is addictive it is so good!"}
{"text":"Downgraded from 5 to 2 stars. The last couple of times I have come here, the burgers see him smaller, the buns aren't as good, and the prices are higher. Burger 21 or Cowfish are much better options. $9-11 for a burger with no sides should be about the best burger around. Not the case anymore at Bang Bang.

Original review below:

This is now my favorite burger place in Charlotte. Just went for the 2nd time yesterday and found out that they just started offering 100% grass fed beef from Virginia.

So far I have had the hangover burger and the TNT burger. Both were awesome, but the TNT is definitely my favorite. Onion rings and fries are all awesome too.

Trumps Bad Daddy's and Cowfish!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, we had the Bang Bang burger which is a classic american burger. It had fresh ground meat & the fires were hand cut."}
{"text":"So I didn't realize this was a thing, or a place, or rated the best burgers in town. My mom and I just happened to be out shopping and we were looking for somewhere we'd never been. Yelp let us to Bang Bang Burgers. The vibe of the place seems pretty hipster but with tons of families in for the food. Overall very chill and a neighborhood feel. We didn't try any of the craziness on the menu, but stuck with a good ol' bacon cheeseburger and fries. I have to say the burger was good but honestly I feel like I'm still looking for that awesome local burger place. It didn't wow me in the least; good but not memorable. What did wow me were the fries. Hand cut and fried to perfection (a little salty for my taste but still so good)!! Seriously I went on and on about how good I thought they were. I will definitely come back and try some of there other items and of course to get my fry fix!!"}
{"text":"Staff, service, food, and beer = 10 of 10.  The hangover was .  Second to none on meat flavor and quality.  A great, well thought out product for sure!  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to check out the burger that's rated #1 in Charlotte and couldn't wait to take our first bite of this juicy delight.  Well I hate to admit it but, I was very disappointed once the order hit the table.  We both looked at each other and asked the same question...is that it?

We ordered the Cowboy burger and if I had to describe it in one word, I'd have to say it was BLAH!  No flavor at all, dry bun, tiny flat burger that looks like I cooked it at home and barbecue sauce was on the side in a little cup.  The only thing that saved this meal were the French fries and the free refill of beverage to wash the burger down.

As far as I'm concerned, I won't be going back to that establishment for a $13 burger, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"Bang bang is for sure my favorite burger in charlotte. I usually just get the basic bang bang burger with cheddar and extra bang bang sauce for dipping my fries. The fries are fantastic! They are my favorite fries in Charlotte. The sweet potato fries are okay but I've had better. Go for the regular fries as your side, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hangover Burger - egg over medium - drip down your arm fabulous.  Get the egg over hard for the bun to be a little less soggy as you devour.

Next visit basic Burger Bowl - subbed BBQ sauce for the lemon & vinegar dressing.  

Bang Bang Burger is a carnivore's dream!"}
{"text":"First off, whoever thinks these burgers are flavorless definitely has their taste buds all out of wack. Secondly, yes the meat isn't a steroid induced pile of cow, but that's why they have doubles. Giving a place a bad review due to an issue that you could have easily solved is pretty sketch. The pictures of the burgers are everywhere! And are true to size. Which is exactly why when I saw the meat size and heard my tummy rumble I opted for the double. So let me know when you open a restaurant, I'd love to complain about your forks not being shiny enough or some other nonsense.

Now onto the actual review.

As a California native, a meatatarian, burger enthusiast and an explorer of new or underrated restaurants, I was MORE than impressed. I LOVE a good burger and have been searching for the best in Charlotte for a while now. Bad Daddys definitely had the lead on that one, until now. There are 2 key elements to a good burger, the meat and well, everything else. Now having a delicious one or the other is enough to impress me, but having both? You win this round, Bang Bang. 

I ordered the TNT burger because it offered something called wasabi cheddar. Being disappointed with any other Charlotte restaurant cheddar anything (processed cheddar sauce is blasphemous to the cheese Gods), I was a little nervous but wasabi makes the acids in my stomach bubble and that's ok by me. The atmosphere of the place was very calm and clean. You can tell it's new because with burgers that good the place should have been packed! We drank our delicious White Rascal (awesome selection of beer) and then in comes a ray of light from the kitchen. This burger was served on a wood plank with a hefty serving of fresh cut fries and all the fixings on the side which I loved. My burger came with deep fried jalapenos and onions which were fried to perfection. The bang bang sauce was pretty good but I completely ignored it once I discovered the amazing wasabi cheddar. Finally! A Charlotte restaurant that treats cheese with respect.  I slathered my crispy bun with wasabi and went in for the kill. Bite one caused a river of meat juices to fall onto my plank and more importantly into my mouth. WOW. The meat was beyond juicy! I almost thought I was having steak how juicy it was. Going for the double was the best idea I had all day! How that monstrosity fit in my mouth I'll never get! (That's what she said). They put what I believe to be pepper jack on the meat and was it delicious! The cheese dripped from my burger like it does on a TMNT cartoon pizza. I was in heaven. Those deep fried jalapenos and onions were definitely the cherry on top. They took onion rings to a whole new level. The fries were fresh and crisp and did a great job of supporting this succulent beast. Every bite, every juice drop down my cheek, every sniffle from the wasabi was like watching a pegasus gallop into the sunset. 


The only thing that could have been done better was the pricing. It was a bit more than we expected to pay for burgers but we seemed to care less and less with each bite.

That being said, they've earned the 5 stars. They were so good, I wanted to Bang Bang the chef."}
{"text":"My socks were blown off of my feet! I love a good burger, and I must say they did it right! They have great signature options, but what really woo-ed me was the quality of the meat. Most burger joints have  good signatures but lack flavor in the actual meat. 

Personally I am a sucker for a burger with an egg on it so I HAD to get the Hang-Over, and it didn't disappoint. U have suggested this restaurant to my friends as well"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I eat at Bang Bangs tonight.  The food was great, the staff was nice, and the ambiance was inviting.  I would suggest this place to a friend or family member."}
{"text":"When I ordered from BBB they told me that my burger could not be cooked to temperature. I feel that any place that considers themselves \"former burgers\" should allow this. I recently had a friend tell me they do so I'm not sure why I was informed otherwise. I think they have a lot of growing to do before they are a true competitor in the burger business."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and was pleasantly surprised they offered a veggie \"burger\" option that wasn't just a veggie pattie. They use mondo sized portobella mushrooms which is lightly battered tempura style and top it off with large onion rings. A little on the greasy side but full of flavor with their signature bang bang sauce. For a veggie option it's the same cost as a meat option which I don't see how that is fair. I usually order it with sweet potato fries with a sweet maple white sauce but the sweet potato fries are always over cooked and rubbery. 

If you've ever been to a Zoe's Kichen or Panera that is how this restaurant is set up. But the atmosphere reminds you of a Chipotle. You go in, fall in line and order and they give you a number as you wait at a table of your choosing. Service is very friendly and helpful with their menu."}
{"text":"I SO wanted to give this place a better review. I really did. But that bun just did this burger in. I ordered the PORTABELLA & GRUYERE Burger, got a double, and asked for it \"medium.\" Well it came well done. Strike one. 

Now a \"double\" here would equal most places Half-Pound burger, so get that if you're hungry (which I definitely was)! Was it tasty? Yes. Was the bun fresh and soft? NO. It was a tough chew, and I wound up leaving half of it on the table. That will NOT win you many admirerers Bang Bang! What sets others apart is the quality of the bun.....and this one really, I hate to say it, sucked! It just did. Could have been stale....I don't know. But I do know is that I couldn't eat that bun. I scraped off the meat and ate that. That was decent, and the mushroom and cheese was pretty good.

But I mean, come on Bang Bang, that bun was stale and you know it! And yet you served it. 

Overall a \"meh\" experience. IF you want a GREAT burger, go to Cowfish, Diamond or the LIberty. All do great burgers!"}
{"text":"I got take out from Bang Bang last Saturday. I don't eat beef, so I ordered a chicken club and my friend got a burger. We placed a detailed order over the phone and were able to pick up in just 10 minutes.
Unfortunately, when we got back to the house my friend bit into his burger and discovered that it was medium rare. When we placed the order we had requested well-done. I called the restaurant to let them know about the issue and told them I could come back to pick up my correct order. They were very nice and even gave me a $5 gift card for the inconvenience, along with replacing the burger. 
Once we got the correct order it was absolutely delicious. My chicken sandwich was cooked PERFECTLY (not dry, like many) and their sweet potato fries were delish. 
I will definitely be back to Bang Bang Burgers. Even if their food wasn't so yummy, I'd be back just because their customer service was so spot-on."}
{"text":"Aww man, the Bang bang burger was so good, I didn't even use any of the lettuce, tomato, or onions on it. The sauce was also real good. It is a order first, then sit, or to go place.  Very classy. 

This is the first place I will take anyone to who comes to Charlotte to visit us."}
{"text":"Honestly...not anywhere near to what I expected. Another disappointment of a North Carolina establishment of food. Not excited about this, but one thing. The ranch. 

Alright, we literally planned this for weeks and a group of 10 of us showed up. Ok it's a smaller place and seating for the time we went wasn't an issue, but it definitely could have been, so I am thankful for that. 

I ordered the weekly special which was the chimichurri burger and it sounded good. I got this over the TNT burger based on the servers recommendation. We spent over $150 before we go any further.

So I ordered EXTRA crispy fries. They came SOGGY. I asked for MEDIUM cooked, it was WELL. These are two critical errors in a burger joint. They ask me specifically of how I want my burger cooked and then it comes out wrong, then that's on them not me. When I asked for extra crispy fries then they are not even stiff they were soggy and lumpy. UGH. The flavor was fine on the special actually so a star for that.

My friend next to me got the pimento cheese burger and added burger. It was good and add a star to this review.

Here is why I didn't say anything. I didn't eat anything all day. I hate sending food back as a matter of purpose and waste. Purpose it should be done right the first time. Ok we are not perfect fine. And then I didn't want to literally waste a whole meal in the trash. And no one came to check on us to see how our food was so I couldn't even say anything anyways. 

The ranch was good. Another star for that. Honestly I will give them another try. I'm just annoyed my burger was over cooked and my fries were soggy and halfway cold. Well till next time."}
{"text":"Burger places are a dime a dozen, and a couple times a year a new one pops up somewhere in the Charlotte area. Most are decent enough, but very few stand out from the crowd that pleasantly surprise me. And now every trendy micro-chain tries to stand out with a wider variety of ingredients, sauces, or meats, all of them trying to offer a wider array of options for every appetite. Options aplenty, but the flavors themselves are sometimes blandly the same from one place to the next, which just isn't acceptable when you could have the same result on your grill at home. 

Yet every now and then, I get a seriously good burger that makes me want to sing its praises. Bang Bang has some seriously banging burgers. The patties are flavorful, juicy, and large. I tried the aptly named Hangover burger, about $10 with a large side of fries. The toasted buns held the mountain of fresh toppings. You can taste when something was cooked hours ago and just reheated, or freshly made to order. Bang Bang does it the latter way and your tastebuds reap the rewards."}
{"text":"Pretty delish burgers, prepared so many different ways and with so many different toppings... Great fries as well.

Even bigger bonus is gluten free buns are available! Will be back when I'm craving a burger"}
{"text":"I was told that these were the best burgers in Charlotte, and whether or not that is true is not relevant because they are outstanding.  I have gone twice, and ordered two different burgers and was thrilled with both of them.  They have a very fun menu with lots of great choices.  The fries and onion rings are also exceptional.  This is definitely a place worth seeking out.  It doesn't have any kind of ambiance but it does have fantastic food.  If it were closer I would stop by on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch over the weekend and was super impressed from the start. The folks who worked there were so nice and helpful. I had the TNT burger with a black been patty and my husband had the guacamole burger with a black bean patty, we both had fries as our side. All of it was delicious. They use local buns and everything they have there is homemade including all their sauces. The burgers were delicious. My TNT burger wasn't as spicy as I would have expected but it was still good. We also ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer, they have  tempura batter (I think) which is slightly different from others I have had. 
The whole thing was a great experience and we will def. be going back!"}
{"text":"Meted pimiento cheese burger -yum!  Great burgers, buns, fries, and o-rings with specialty sauces. Reasonable prices for what your getting and are not forced to get a monster burger and pay extra, like some gourmet burger joints. Friendly staff, clean location. Would return for more. Not over-priced and all pretentious like some restaurants that have been featured on DD&D."}
{"text":"The Seoul burger is back (albeit slightly different than before) and the pricing that includes fries has also returned. Unfortunately the fries have been off the last couple of times - they're harder/crispier now. The innovation is also less frequent, with weekly specials usually recycled from previous ones.

Look forward to continuing to drop in from time to time, but there are also several other good burger places around now that may be worth trying."}
{"text":"We tried Bang Bang for the first time yesterday. I got the TNT burger for something spicy (pic attached). Angle on my pic was not great but there are two patties in there. The burger was DELICIOUS... even though It had onion strings, jalapeños and ghost pepper cheese on it, you could really taste the juicy meat (Pat LaFreida's beef... the best!). Everything was cooked perfectly (bun, patties, onion rings).... rings were tasty! My wife got the mushroom Swiss burger, which had nice thick and long strips of portobello over the swiss... which she ever much enjoyed. My son got the kids burger with bacon and cheese and ate the entire burger (not small). If you plan on eating there, it's a but tight (not a large seating area), and there were plenty folks getting take out. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I had the guacamole single patty burger and it was really good. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and the neat was not overdone. The burger was the right size too. I find it that most places think bigger is better, and this place has found just the right size for a burger so that you don't end up hating yourself at the end. I also had the sweet potato fries with the maple dip, and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"As long as you catch this place when it's not crawling with woke neighborhood toddlers this place is great. The burgers are a perfect balance between old school and steakhouse. The flavor combinations are great. Onion rings are exquisite. For those who lament the loss of Herlocker's rings, this place will fill that greasy little corner of your heart."}
{"text":"Had the Mushroom & Swiss burger, it was tasty but small. IMO, Smashburger has a better Mushroom burger, bigger and less money. The fries everyone raves about- meh at best. Maybe I had a not-so-fresh batch but I LOVE fries and these were average at best."}
{"text":"I love their special sauce. Their cheeseburger egg rolls are amazing.  Great service!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are some of the best I've had. Can get them as single or double patties of grass fed beef, cooked to your liking. I had the Cowboy burger and devoured it. My friends had the Hangover burger and the daily special Jalapeño stuffed burger. They also agreed that these are some of the best around. Fresh cut fries or sweet potato fries, and onion rings to die for on the side. Can't go wrong. Also, they only serve local brews, so that's a nice perk."}
{"text":"Had the burger bowl and it was very tasty. Two other burgers at table and both were excellent. Since we were new customers they gave us samples of chips and they were very tasty. Staff was very nice and helpful in explaining the menu. Wish this place was back home in WA because I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The hype is real, these burgers are delicious! Nice juicy patty, soft toasted buns. Exactly what a burger should be! The fries are delicious, crunchy, and not too filling. The onion rings are crisp and light, perfectly cooked.

They are just a little bit on the pricey side, but there's definitely quality here.

Coming back here for sure, love it!"}
{"text":"I visited on the recommendation of a friend.  I was very impressed.  When I first heard of this place I figured it was just another burger spot jumping on the bandwagon with average burgers.  Charlotte rewards safe, chain like, average food establishments, and I thought that's what I would experience.  This is not the case.  It's a small, counter service, gourmet burger joint.  The food is presented very nicely, but it's the quality that really matters.  A friend and I tried two different burgers and a couple different sides.  Everything was clearly hand crafted and the additional care they take in the kitchen came through in the taste.  This is better than bad daddy's and better than five guys, and currently rates as my top burger in Charlotte.  Any foodie needs to visit and check this place off their list, it's worth it.  I'm happy to see an independent, food first place have great success in our city.  I'm so sick of seeing chains pop up and do well.  Reward the independent risk takers that clearly contribute to the culinary development of this city!!!"}
{"text":"I just ate THE best burger I have ever had- any city, including the QC. The \"Hangover Burger\". Medium juicy char-burger of Angus high quality beef,  delicious caramelized onions trapped in a web of gooey cheddar cheese and who even asked for a smattering of potato bacon hash. Topped off with a perfectly fried egg cooked to your liking. All between a buttery toasted brioche bun.....  Fries-  crispy and flavorful; a perfect accompaniment"}
{"text":"Seriously? What's all the hype about? 
The burgers were small, the prices were big and the  flavor was nothing to write home about.
I got the TNT burger and it came out with 3 paper thin slices of jalapeño. At this rate they probably only need 1 peppers a day.
My sister and her family met me here for lunch and we all left thinking it was ok food, but definitely felt it was an over priced average burger joint."}
{"text":"A trip to Charlotte always means trying somewhere new for us. After considering all of our options and our cravings, we decided on Bang Bang Burgers. And my taste buds sure were happy that we did.

Walking into Bang Bang Burgers, I had no idea what I was going to order. But as soon as I saw the specials sign with the Mac and Cheese Burger, I knew I had to get it. This burger was topped with housemade mac and cheese and bacon that was drizzled with honey and sriracha. It sounded like such a good balance of flavors that I just couldn't resist. I ordered it with two patties and with a side of the sweet potato fries. The burger was really juicy and I loved the flavor of the burger and the sweet potato fries were super fresh.

The staff here also delivered great service. Since we had never been there before, the cashier let us know what some of the more popular burgers were and next time I am going to go with their award winning Pimento Burger for sure. Not to mention, the staff here also brought out our food super fast. 

We got to the shopping center a little after 1:30PM on a Saturday and were happy to see that there were some available spots to park. But I wouldn't be surprised if the parking here gets tough. There were even flyers on the tables in the restaurant warning you from parking there and walking across the street, because you might get towed or get a ticket."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the quality of food here and by the friendliness of the staff. My wife and I so enjoyed our two burgers (the pimento and gangnam) on our first trip that we came back a second time two days later. I had the classic bang bang and she had a salad with grass-fed beef burger on top. Really really good. The meat quality is just fantastic. 

The sides were also delicious. The first time we had some really cool beef egg rolls and fried pickles. The second time we had some regular fries and some sweet potato chips? with some incredible maple sauce (I think with real maple syrup). There was tons of flavor in all of this.

We're rarely in Charlotte but when we are we will be going back. The store is tucked away in this hidden shopping center but well worth making the trek."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Bang Bang Burgers, you are missing out! I love the Elizabeth spot because it's quiet away from the hustle of uptown and the service is fast and friendly. My personal favorite is the Cowboy Burger with grilled onions, BBQ sauce, and bacon. My fiancé grabbed the Pimento Burger with pimento cheese and jalapeños which was delicious!! There isn't a bad burger there! Honestly, as much as I love the hand cut fries, I tried the homemade BBQ chips and they are my new favorite! Go, stuff your face and be merry. You'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Im glad Me and my wife came to Bang Bang! Phenomenal burgers and great atmosphere. The patty is tender and juicy and their souses are rocking good. We tried the Guacamole and the Mushroom & Swiss and they both were great choices. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Their burgers are so crazy delicious! Very creative menu selection and it all seems to work so well! The pork belly is awesome!"}
{"text":"This meat is damn good y'all. I was extremely impressed in the quality and way it was cooked. Perfect perfect perfect. This would be 5 stars but the toppings were a bit lackluster. I had the inferno (I think that's the name)...and the heat just wasn't there in the way I expected. The fries were fantastic. I can't wait to go back! Delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a local in the neighborhood, I've been several times and even took my mother! Every time I've visited.. I've always enjoyed! Anyone who would gives this place a bad or even medium review should go back out in the burbs where you can find all of the xtra toppings that make a burger good. In the case of Bang Bang.. The burger is fresh, real beef that hasn't been pumped full of steroids and that's what makes a good burger! I'd recommend this place to anyone and everyone (which I have)!  I'd say visit.. The \"decor\" dosent matter.. It's a real burger folks!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time coming to this place. I told the woman Adasia this and she seemed to not have a care at all. I was asking questions about the menu and she was no help. She kept brushing my questions off in the rudest way possible. Unfriendly and never coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to get some burgers and food that are not your typical burger joint fare. The employees and owner are extremely friendly and helpful. They have grass fed beef, interesting burger combos and a good selection of local beers. I really enjoyed being able to just order a burger and sit down without having to deal with a wait person. It's like a gourmet version of Five Guys. The only thing that I would like to see is a little more crisp to the fries and a little more seasoning on the beef but all in all it's a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Situated near the busy shopping complexes in the neighborhood of Elizabeth l, I could bet this restaurant would be packed with people on weekdays for lunch! Entering inside found the line up to the counter was towards the right, but having missed it we thought a waiter would seat us inside. But it was a self order restaurant. The menu was small and easy which saves you the trouble of going to through pages of exotic food with hopes of getting back something close! My friends and I ordered a couple of TNT beef burgers and chicken sandwiches with sides. We took an empty table and our food came within a really short wait. The burgers were extremely tasty and juicy. The sides were not perfect- the French fries looked shabby and the onions rings thick with excess flour. Towards the end of our meal, we started taking smaller bites since everyone of us wanted to extend the relishing taste of the juicy burgers on our palate and rather take smaller bites than finishing early with empty plates.

Looking at the reviews we initially thought the place would be a fine dine restaurant but it was a modest place serving great delicious burgers! Definitely recommended for any foodie! Or Burgerie!"}
{"text":"Greasy, seriously, when your 15 yo son won't finish a burger? Not sure what the reviews are about!? Won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved.this.place!!! Every thing about my burger was excellent. The bun was perfectly moist and warm. There was this mix of bacon and potato hash (omg!)....The sweet potato fries and dip were amazing. I really can't wait to try one of the Korean inspired burgers!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, ask for a well done patty if you don't like rare! Great flavor, good prices, friendly staff. Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to come to this establishment as I'm new to the area and looking for the best burger in Charlotte! 

I ordered a double cheeseburger (no additional toppings). Cost $12.50 (fries and drink not included)

The place was packed, but only had to wait 10 minutes to get a table.. an additional 20 before we got our food.

First impression: small small patties... almost as small as a $1 burger patty from a fast food establishment.

Taste: Great! Not the best I've had, but very good!

After I finished my burger.. my friend looks at me.. \"you still hungry too huh?\" 

Conclusion: Great tasting burger, but it was too expensive for what it was! The small patties left us still hungry! I don't see myself coming back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Bang Bang is one of my favorite new restaurants in Charlotte. Very quality driven restaurant. Everything was fresh tasting and equally delicious. This place has everything you expect from a burger joint...and more. The staff is very friendly, informative and hospitable but selecting the right menu item can be hard since everything looks so good. The presentation is just as appetizing as the food itself. They also have vegetarian options which is always a plus. I strongly recommend Bang Bang."}
{"text":"Based on one visit. Parking was adequate. Quick ordering. Bun toasted perfectly. Toppings fresh.  Hamburger ok but not write home good. Onion ring were good. Service was as expected Place overall clean. Bathroom dingy but ok. Why three stars?  The smell. I don't know if it is the air freshner or what but where I sat it had a strong industrial cleaner aroma (like pine-sol).  Really took away from the otherwise good experience"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Charlotte. Fresh and high quality ingredients, cooked really well. The fries are amazing too."}
{"text":"Bang bang sauce was amazing.  The burgers and fried were average. The sauce was better than average. Atmosphere was weak. Order at the counter. Not enough seating for groups larger than 4 people.  Had to share a table with a lady we didn't know.  She was nice. :)"}
{"text":"Used to love this spot but the burgers have recently been significantly downsized. Very disappointing- will be looking at other burger  joints in charlotte."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burger and it was good!! Nice and juicy and cooked to perfection!! Very good. Fries weren't all that seasoned well, I added salt to my ketchup for dipping. Nice cozy environment. Would eat here again!!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are great. If you like the whole craft burger thing, you will like this place. There really is not much to be said here. From a taste-perspective, Bang Bang Burgers gets five stars.

The reason for three stars, though, is because of how annoying the business model of some of these craft burger places are. We get it, your burgers are far superior than the concoction that McDonald's passes off as a burger, and 90% of the people coming here are fully willing to pay $10-$15 for a burger and fries meal (I certainly am). The problem is always the portion size. If you lift, workout, or are anything but paper-thin good luck getting full off of these portions. Why not charge a little more and provide normal portions?

I do believe that the place had an option to add an extra patty, but that really does not help since, unless you have eaten here before, you have no clue how big/small the burger by itself is. Why would I order an extra patty just in case?

Again, great food, but poor portioning. Please, just charge a bit more for normal portions."}
{"text":"This was honestly the best burger ever! So juicy and so flavorful!! This is a must try and should become a place for everyone regular go to burger place! The owner is so nice and so is the staff. Please go check it out!"}
{"text":"Loved that they had vegetarian option!! The quinoa bean burger tasted exactly how I tasted but with more black beans. I didn't mind the taste but with sriracha, it was amazing. The fries are obviously on point."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the grass fed party option is much appreciated.  The downside is I read online that they use a mix of beef tallow and canola oil in their fryer, but was disappointed to see they don't even know what beef tallow is (it's rendered beef fat and is great for frying) and they certainly don't use it for the fryer.  I will continue my search for a great burger bar that isn't too cheap to use a good quality fat for their fryer."}
{"text":"This little burger joint is amazing and I'm so glad I found it! They have really cool burgers, like the guacamole burger (which is delicious by the way). The service is great and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The best burger in Charlotte without a doubt!  This place is all about the food and I'm all about theirs. Not many burger joints keep me coming back but Bang Bang's creations are unique and exciting to the type of person who is sick of the average five guys standard.  I recommend the hangover burger which is amazing complete with potato bacon hash.   In addition the cowboy burger is incredibly delicious as well with a truly unique BBQ sauce that come on the side.  I also enjoyed some of the old burgers they had which featured porkbelly but I'm sure they are constantly changing up the menu.  I've also heard they have many off menu items and I'm sure they can pretty much make a burger anyway you like. Lastly, the fries here and other sides are all great which only add to the experience.  BONUS:  they have Mexican Coke by the liter in a glass bottle for any of you Coca Cola aficionados out there.  Enjoy- I know I'll be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the guacamole burger minus the corn salsa. The guacamole tastes perfect and the burgers are cooked to order. As for the sides, I really like the onion rings and broccoli. This place is definitely a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"One of my \"Go-To' lunch stops. The burgers here are fantastic for fast-casual, and their sides are solid as well (fries, onion rings, and - get this - broccoli when you're feeling marginally healthier). I generally call ahead while on the way there, and my order is always ready on arrival as little as ten minutes later.

I go with the TNT Burger (which, since a menu shakeup early this year, is genuinely spicy) and have turned a number of co-workers on to it as well. They offer single and double patties, and the single is generally more than enough for me. I've done the double patty a couple of times and it tends to 1) overwhelm the rest of the preparation and 2) leave me somewhat uncomfortably full. I switch between the fries (which should be eaten while warm, since they lose a lot as they cool down) and onion rings (which taste great but are just a bit oily and can weigh me down post-meal) as a general rule, but can attest for the healthier alternative as well. The broccoli is al dente enough to deliver a nice crunch. Which is cool and unexpected at a burger joint.

I can't speak to eating there since I always do take-out, but it seems like the folks who are doing so are having a fine time for the bare-bones environment.

Food grade: 5. They make some fine burgers.
Experience: 4. It is what it is, and and issue in this area is wildly outweighed by the burgers."}
{"text":"A very good place to go and get a burger! A lot of very creative burger combinations. If you aren't a plain cheeseburger kind of guy bang bang has something for you. On the other hand they have pretty good plain cheeseburgers as well. 

I like that they have healthy options like broccoli as a side or you can get your burger lettuce wrapped. One of my two favorite Charlotte burger places and for sure worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Bang Bang is my fav burger place. I have not been disappointed yet. The Hangover, Seoul, Gangnam Style, and of course the Classic Bang Bang Burger is all fan-freakin-tactic.  They use buns from Dukes Bread and they offer a choice of LaFrieda or grass fed beef patties.  Local beer on tap and a choice selection of sides like fried homemade pickles, hand cut fries, and house made onion rings round out the menu. 

I live in LA and can't wait for my next trip to Charlotte just so can grab one of these burgers. Worth the 2500 mile trip...yeah."}
{"text":"Great find! Had the Bang Bang Burger with 100% grass fed beef. Loved it. They only cook their burgers medium or well done. I am usually strictly well done but the server recommended that since my beef was more lean that I should get it medium to have a juicer burger. I'm glad he told me that! There was no pink yet it was still very juice and tender! Very unique burger joint that sells other food as well. Love it and will come again."}
{"text":"Good not great. The rolls that the burgers are on are fantastic. The toppings were the largest downfall - the bacon was pencil thin and pretty over cooked, the lettuce and tomato were not what should come on a $12 burger. The customer service was a little below average for the price. I think they're fishing with dynamite due to their location, so it's unlikely they will improve - but some small improvements would go a long way value wise."}
{"text":"This Wisconsin girl has eaten her share of burgers BUT this one is the BEST burger - EVER! Bravo Bang Bang (maybe a new name for a special LOL). Fries were cooked perfect. Love the simplicity of the concept. Next time I will try a specialty burger and onion rings or quinoa salad. I was going for the basic to measure flavor and the results were off the charts! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I decided to try it because it had 4.5 stars on Yelp!  It was a great decision!  The burgers are really bang bang good.  The atmosphere was great and the staff were very friendly. They deserve 5 stars in my book.  Btw...the chips and onion rings were perfect!!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a burger you never want to end. And if you're indecisive, like me, it's best to look up their menu online... I can never choose between all that delicious-ness."}
{"text":"Favorite burger joint in Charlotte! A must try if you're in the area. Nice restaurant setup, service is awesome, extremely clean, and phenomenal food! \"The Hangover\" is my personal favorite and the fried egg is definitely the cherry on top to the burger! Not to mention the house sauce as well, YUMMMM. Mouthwatering just thinking about it lol"}
{"text":"Let's see, you show up to Bang Bang and don't order onion rings? YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, SIR/MA'AM.

Yes, the burgers are the showstoppers but the onion rings are bonafide scene stealers. They are lightly-battered rings that are fried in such a way, your taste buds will rejoice. Yes, I'm being awfully dramatic in describing onion rings but they are just that good.

Now, back to the burger. I went the classic route and ordered the bang bang burger because when in Rome, am I right? It also comes with bang bang sauce which you need to fully slather on top of your burger as well as use to liberally dip aforementioned onion rings in. I'm not usually a pickles on my burger girl but bang bang makes their own pickles and that changes everything. The pickles were/are lightly tangy and crisp. I would've been very happy with a heavy-handed portion of the pickles on my burger.

I asked for my burger to be cooked 'medium' and it was juicy and perfectly cooked. Needless to say, I inhaled the burger. After finishing off the burger, I was satisfied and didn't feel like a gross overeating beast (like normal).

They offer burgers of the week as well as weekday specials such as 'half off craft beers' on Wednesdays and 'kids eat free' Tuesdays. The interior is short on space and can get pretty hot inside on a warm day. There are a couple of tables right outside for outdoor dining.

Thankfully, the menu isn't that extensive so I'm pretty confident in being able to try every single one. I cannot wait to go back, I'm already planning on taking a bite out of the cowboy burger!"}
{"text":"Great burger place! I had the bang bang burger, it was fresh and the sauce was awesome! I wasn't a huge fan of the french fries but that won't stop me from returning. Reasonably priced and great beer selection."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the burger.  Ordered it medium well it was served medium rare.  Sent it back for well done it was still served at most medium. The sweet potato fries were almost done.  The people working were real nice. But very i pleased with the food."}
{"text":"The burger, sweet potato fries, and sauces are definitely good.  The problem with the basic burger is that the price is too high for the small bit of burger they put on there. 

I don't mind paying for a good product, but I also don't like to feel ripped off.

 So they need to do one of two things: reduce the price or up the beef."}
{"text":"I have eaten the other moderately high priced burger joints too many times. Tonight was my first time at Bang Bang. For about $1.50 more than the others, it's an easy choice. The best meat of the joints by miles. Well seasoned and very well cooked. Some other \"guys\" have better fries, but only slightly. Beautifully toasted bun. Good assortment of condiments. Really good fries. Just a well crafted, quality burger experience."}
{"text":"Best burger hands down. Not even close. Cheeseburger egg rolls for appetizer. If you are in Charlotte and haven't been here. You are doing it wrong."}
{"text":"This is a very well hidden & almost unknown gem. I'm a foodie & had to be sent to this establishment. The décor is nice but a little cramped of a space. We went on Saturday evening but were able to find a seat at a booth for the 4 of us. We had the spicy TNT burger which had the right amount of heat & spice but was super tasty with the fresh jalapenos & siracha mayo, we also had the Hangover burger with an over easy egg which was delightful with the potato hash & bang sauce dolled out on top. Highly recommended & good on a budget."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints. Love the concept, food, and exceptional service. Get the TNT burger if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem in Charlotte. The Cowboy Burger (I think that's the name) is amazing. The fries are delicious. The service was awesome. VERY impressed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say I have eaten anything here that I didn't like. Their quality of meat is unlike most burgers in Charlotte.  My first and most favorite burger here would be the TNT burger. I did recently have the hangover burger (not with a hangover but it definitely will cure one!) with the famous bang bang sauce, to be honest it tastes like thousand island dressing but still tastes great with the burger. 

If you come in more than once start looking for their burger of the day, they're really creative. Also, you can substitute fries for more healthy options (yay for us girls sort of trying to keep that figure) 

The staff at this place is simply amazing as well! Very friendly."}
{"text":"I eat at Bang Bang a couple times a month. The best burger in town. I eat in, order for takeout and it's always perfect. So glad it's on the way home from work so I can grab something when I'm craving a yummy burger. Blu burger is my fav when they have blue cheese the runner up is the Cowboy burger. Love the fries!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night for the first time. Overall, it was a so-so experience. I ordered the pimento burger with the barbeque chips. The burger was flavorful and juicy. The pimento cheese was creamy, but a bit bland. I could've done without the fried pickles on it. They were sweet and a bit soggy. I was hoping for salty and crunchy. The housemade chips and ranch were really good. For 3 people, we spent about $45 on burgers and drinks. I found that to be a tad expensive, mostly because this isn't exactly a sit-down restaurant. There's no patio and it's a small space. You order at a counter and get a number. So, I feel there are better burgers with better atmosphere for that kind of cash. On the plus side, it's kid and family friendly. I suppose if I'm over that way and need a quick bite, I'd try it again."}
{"text":"First time here, but I can't think of a single thing that wasn't good! We had burgers (cooked to order) grilled onions is an option (plus!), fries are delicious with malt vinegar (another plus), and I opted to try something new with the quinoa salad. Loved it!  Friendly & quick service, too! I can't think of why I wouldn't give it 5 stars for our experience this time. Bravo!"}
{"text":"First time was excellent, definitely planning on going back, soon. I'm always in search for good Paleo options and the Burger bowl is one of the best I've had in Charlotte. From the perfectly cooked grass fed burger to the lemon olive oil dressing. 

The customer service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Charlotte by far!!! I have been there 4 times and it never fails to impress me!!"}
{"text":"The BESt burger I've ever had!!! I got the Seoul burger with kimchi and bulgogi sauce. The burger was so juicy and the kimchi wasn't too spicy. My husband got the burger with egg. He also loved his burger. The fries are also nice and crispy. Please open up a branch in the Raleigh area!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Huntersville to try this spot based on their positive reviews. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The burgers were basic and almost mushy! The fries were hard and stale, the prices aren't horrible but then again you aren't getting a quality burger. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I gave Bang Bang a try last weekend and it was just OK, but worth more visits. I agree with some of the other reviews about the ratio of beef to bun - heavily skewed toward bun. 

The guacamole burger had a great presentation and the accompanying BBQ house chips were great. The flavor was there, but it left me craving more guac, corn, and red onion. 

I appreciate thinner beef patties, but the bun was too much. I am not a fan of the bun itself; it was a bit too airy. I prefer a bun on the denser side that holds up to a burger and all the toppings. 

The staff was great; they explained the menu to us and were friendly. I also liked the feel and decor - warm and inviting."}
{"text":"This was easily the best burger I've ever had. Hands down. No competition. I had the Seoul 2.0 and my wife had the special which was a fried green tomato burger. I couldn't be happier with the food's flavor, quality, speed of arrival to our table, or price. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants a great burger."}
{"text":"I've only experienced this place via takeout picked up by a co-worker but sweet baby Jesus what a burger! I had the korean pork belly burger. Now let me tell you, I know my Korean food (sister is half Korean) and this was some bangin pork belly! I asked for my burger medium which in most cases ends up medium well and I HATE overcooked meat. This burger was cooked PERFECTLY! The bun was nice and toasted and the fries were some of the best I've eaten. I never thought I'd say this but Five Guys has now been dethroned as my favorite burger joint. Bang Bang Burger you rocked my taste buds and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Make your own combos and the House sauce (bang bang sauce) tastes awesome ... patties are juicy and not over cooked ."}
{"text":"Short review:  Eat here. It's amazing. 

Seriously. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Came here based on the recommendation of a friend and I do not regret it one bit. It's pretty low key and not fancy at all but the quality of the food is astounding. The only thing that could make it better is a delicious milkshake but that's no reason to hate. They focus on burgers obviously and man they do it right."}
{"text":"Okay... I've been here three times. The first trip was just after they opened. Burger was good, burger sizes were good, got a double, and fries were average. Spent right at $15 bucks. Second trip... burgers were smaller. Again, $15 bucks for a double, fries and drink. Third and final visit... burgers were literally the size sausage patties. The bun  had plenty of room all the way around.  The waitress tried to tell me the longer they cook the burger the smaller they get. I ordered them medium. For me Elizabeth deserves a much better burger joint, and a much better price point. And the bang bag sauce is 1000 Island dressing. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"My coworker and I have been in a long disagreement over the best burger in Charlotte. There was a time a couple years ago that I thought it was the 704 burger from RiRa's, but they have sadly since let me down. So when we were planning a lunch catch up we decided to take the trip down to Elizabeth for bang bang burgers. Parking in the area is not easy. We arrived at 11:40 and were just barley able to grab a spot in the complex. We arrived and it was pretty empty. I ordered the special which was a blue cheese burger and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce were amazing. For the burger, I really loved all of the toppings. Everything was fresh and flavorful. They also do an amazing job not over cooking the thin patties. However, my mind was not blown. I did not love the bun. I felt they were dry and didn't complement the burger very well. I did love the vibes and definitely do not regret my bang bang burger lunch, but I'm still waiting for my favorite burger in the queen city."}
{"text":"I went to Bang Bang for the first time yesterday.  The girl at the register was extremely helpful at explaining the menu.  I got the guacamole burger - single patty, medium.  I would defintely come here again for a quick, quality burger! TVs so you can watch sports and they serve local beers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places in Charlotte and I feel like it's a hidden gem, kinda hope it stays that way! The sweet potato fries and maple dip get me every time! I'd come here just for that"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. I've never been dissappointed with the quality of the food or service. I've eaten their bunless burger with broccoli, burger bowl and bang bang burger. Love their signature sauce, it reminds me of thousand island dressing, which I love! Due to the location parking can be an issue during certain times of the day. You pay an average of $14 for a full meal with drink. I definitely recommend trying."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was craving a great burger one night and since I'm fairly new to the Charlotte area, I asked a good friend...he suggested Bang Bang cause it's on my side of town. I went in and ordered a regular Bang Bang burger and it was phenomenal! Cooked perfectly and the service was great! Very friendly staff and helpful...I wasn't sure what to get and she talked me through all their burgers and helped me and my guest determine which we'd like best. I've now been back several times and would recommend them to anyone looking for a great burger in the Plaza Midwood area."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend who is not a red meat eater. She was happy with the other options!! The burger that I got was fantastic! Bang Bang Burgers certainly knows what they are doing when it comes to the burgers. However, the reason why I have to rate them at a 4 is because of the fries. The oil they used made the fries taste like they were mixed with fish. Get that fixed and it's 5 stars here!"}
{"text":"Haven't been disappointed yet. Onion rings are a little greasy but the burgers are perfect."}
{"text":"Absolute BEST burger I've had in Charlotte. Ordered the Hangover cooked medium and the egg on top cooked over medium. Amazing! Very unassuming while passing by but you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm ashamed to say that I eat here weekly! They have this sauce for the sweet potato fries that is Ah-mazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Really high quality burgers here with a diversity of flavor combinations. They recommend going plain cheeseburger on your first visit so you can appreciate the meat. But they make some great sauces and flavors!   I prefer their onion rings to their fries. Good beer choices for an order at the counter style joint."}
{"text":"The Pimento Burger is to die for. Outstanding ambiance, and food to match! Come get you some!!"}
{"text":"*If you have kids? Go on Tuesday. Kids eat free! We have been here a couple times now and I was pleased each time. You order everything separate. *If you want free fries? Download the \"Stealz\" app on your phone. It's easy and worth free fries. Their fries here are good! And they have like 3 flavors (reg, sweet potato, and a garlic kind?). *BURGERS: they have different options listed that you can alter which what kind of bun you want, meat you want (you pay extra for grassfeed beef, but nice to have that option). Also have vegan options. Build your own options. *BEER: they do have like 2-3 drafts usually from somewhere within the area. One night they have a special on a pint but I can't remember which night. *SERVICE: every time I've went we've had someone nice and patient. You order at the counter, pay, sign/tip on the iPad, and they bring your order out to you. *TRY: their fries, I like their sweet potato fries which they serve with some kind of good sauce on the side. I also like their pilmento burger, so if you like that cheese they have a good one they top on their burger (not too runny/melted some places)."}
{"text":"Over 250 reviewers can't be wrong: this place is da bomb. Casual, fast... their burger are delicious and they have something for everyone. My favorite is the Korean burger topped with Kimchi. Their fries and onion rings are pretty good as well. 

If you're hungry, get the double patty, it's well worth it. You also get good local brews. I'm not sure what else to say here. It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"My bacon cheddar bbq burger was okay, the bacon was chewy and tough, the bun while toasted had lost its crunch. The onion rings were fantastic and the bbq was very flavorful. Not sure I felt as though I got my value for the cost. For the cost I expected a larger portion of beef. Proceed cautiously."}
{"text":"The flavor of the blue burger was amazing. The only thing I could suggest is that the burgers could be juicier. A little on the dry side but still delicious! Sweet potato fries were great."}
{"text":"My tastebuds must be off because they have the Worst tasting fries I have ever had. Whatever oil they use Does Not mix well with me. Other than that I had a delicious Hangover burger that was cooked perfectly. 
knowing I hated the regular fries I went ahead and got the sweet potatoes fries and loved them. I'm glad I did. I plan to go back many more times just not for the fries ;)"}
{"text":"Burger was juicy and perfect. Staff was kind. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once to dine in and tonight I ordered to go. The first time around I ordered the guacamole burger. It was delicious! While we waited for our food they brought out a sampling of their homemade BBQ chips - also delicious and appreciated. My friend ordered the same thing, but was disappointed in the size of the patty in proportion to the bun. I didn't mind. The burger and toppings to bun ratio worked just fine for me. If there had been more meat, I probably would have needed more guac to compensate. Just saying. 

Tonight, I ordered the Seoul burger. After an incredibly long day at work, it was amazing. Though, I was searching for the bulgogi sauce. I'm not so sure it made it onto my burger. This time I definitely noticed the petite-ness of the patty. I would say that the bun extended over the beef patty by about an inch. It is a pretty great bun, by the way. Even with the beef deficit, it was tasty. I will order it again. Like others have said, you kind of need to order a double. A single is probably only 1/2 of what you want out of a good burger and also kind of a tease. The bang bang sauce is dope. It's like 1000 island's cousin, but really, who cares? Eat it. You'll like it. 

I don't have much to say about their decor or the physical layout. It's fine, nothing particularly special or memorable. I don't know about you, but I go to restaurants to eat. So, unless a restaurant has a sanitation issue, I couldn't care less about how it looks. Both times, the staff have been friendly and super helpful."}
{"text":"Bang Bang is one of my favorite burger places ever. Their handmade chips are delicious. The bun really makes the burger 11/10."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! If you like spicy , I would definitely recommend the TNT , the white sauce they also serve is amAzinggg!!!"}
{"text":"I've been on a burger kick lately, so while I was in the neighborhood, I wondered into Bang Bang Burgers.  I walked up to the counter, got a hello from the cashier and a single question \"have you ever been here before?\"...\"No.\"...\"Great!  Welcome!  Let me walk you through the menu.\"

They have nice variety of burgers that all come with fries (I hate having to pay $9 for a burger and then having to pay additional for a side).  For a slight upcharge (between $1-$1.50), you can get a different side.  Their other options aren't all fried whatevers.  They actually have items like quinoa and broccoli!  I chose to do the upcharge for broccoli and it was really good.

I just went with the Bang Bang burger.  They were happy to sub the cheese for me.  I think next time, I'm going to try the hangover.  I'm a sucker for a burger with an egg on it.  Burger wasn't massive, but a decent size.  Perfect for me, since I'm not in a competitive eating contest eating a triple patty burger the size of my face.  Burger tasted great.  Good flavor and nice and juicy!  

The food came out super fast.  I got my burger To-Go, and I got my food within 5-10 minutes (just long enough to watch a little TV and read a few things on my phone).

Overall, I was satisfied with the taste of my burger and side.  The service was great for to-go orders.  I don't know if the super casual ambiance would draw me in to actually eat there, but I'll definitely be placing more to-go orders in the future.  Thanks for making my list for repeat burger joints in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Best burger by far I've had in Charlotte... maybe of all time. Had the TNT double and it was a very tasty burger! Onion rings were good too..."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I've ever visited. Everything about my burger was perfect... ridiculously soft and flavorful bun + great blend of beef cooked to a good temperature + interesting toppings to compliment. You can easily tell that the owner is incredibly passionate, and making burgers is his craft. I actually got to meet Joe during my visit - he is a really nice dude who loves what he is doing. His enthusiasm for his product is unparalleled. 

If you're ever in the area, or even if you have to drive an hour (like I did), definitely stop by... You won't be disappointed.

Side note: I had the 'Elvis' Burger (burger of the week) with Tempura Fried Bananas, Peanut Butter, Muenster Cheese, Banana Peppers and Bacon.... SO dope."}
{"text":"I went expecting a burger joint.  I didn't really get it.  My wife and I got a couple of burgers and they were ho hum.  We were the only ones in there when we went around 8:00.  We were eating then all of a sudden the entire staff took a break and started to watch a ridiculously loud video that lasted until we were done and I assume they forgot we were in there.  It was very annoying.  Things like that and the \"ok-ness\" of the food, I won't be foaming at the mouth to go back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. I got the bang bang burger and my boyfriend got the cowboy both were fantastic and so were the fries and onion rings. Would HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone looking for a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"My dad called saying he's in the mood for a burger and asked if I knew of any good places. Do I?

While sitting in the car waiting for my family to arrive, I pulled up their website to see exactly what we were getting ourselves into. Keeping reading to learn the secrets about this Gem.

Have you ever heard of the saying \"The proof is in the pudding\"? Well when it comes to Bang Bang Burger, the proof is definitely in the name. I was able to experience this Gem for the first time with my family and let me tell you we weren't disappointed one bit.

Dukes Bread, owned by Adam and Ellen Duke, is a local bakery here in Charlotte. What makes them so special in the Bang Bang burger experience is that the brioche buns are shaped by hand from scratch with real butter and King Arthur flour, making them fresh. Let's just get one thing clear this is not just any ole flour, we're talking the first class section in the flour bizz.

What stood out most to me was, as I'm ordering my food I caught a glimpse of the menu and it read \"Voted Best Burger 2015, 2016, and 2017\". I instantly fell in love! They definitely have my vote for 2018.

I selected the Cowboy (cooked medium well) which has sharp cheddar, bacon, and Bang Bang's homemade BBQ sauce.

Since 1922 the LaFrieda family (experts in making Bang Bang's juicy burger patties), a third generation meat vendor in North Bergen, New Jersey has been offering different cuts of every source of protein you can think of. 

Earlier I said that the proof is the name. Why is that? My dad paid for three adults meals (a burger, hand cut fries, and a drink) and one kid's meal, he spent a little over forty bucks. Now tell me that's not a steal."}
{"text":"My husband had the cowboy burger with their barbecue sauce, he doesn't like barbecue sauce,  but liked this one! I has the black bean burger with avacado,  and it was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Thursday at 9pm after driving for six hours since I had no food at my apartment. I ordered a lettuce wrapped Seoul burger and broccoli since I had been eating heavy all week. It came out quickly and it really hit the spot.

The Seoul burger was wrapped in two huge lettuce leafs that made eating it maybe half as messy as it could have been. The burger was great with the kimchi really popping against the ground beef. The broccoli was broccoli, but just having a lighter option as a side is nice.

I left feeling lighter than when I came in."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Just a regular burger place. Far from being the best burger in Charlotte. The customer service is also a problem. Employees who seem to be unhappy with their jobs and the restaurant does not like customers to spend time there. You are required to order before you can even seat. My wife sat down with our kids while I was ordering and one of the employees almost kicked her out of the table. Will not return."}
{"text":"I had Bang Bang burgers for the first time tonight and it was really good. I got the guacamole burger which had shaved red onions, grilled corn salsa, guacamole,  and ranch.  when you go and you order at the counter and take a number and they bring you your food. The ranch is phenomenal. They also have beers on draft but only two and a few beers in cans from Noda brewing."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. My mouth is watering just writing this review."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are what dreams are made of and the burgers are sooooooo good. They have gluten free options and local beer. You can't beat it. A small place with a big variety of options."}
{"text":"Too good to serve their original, regular customers these days.  Tried to call in an order 20 minutes before close and I got rejected numerous times and then they coincidentally answered when \"the grill was off\"  
There are many burger joints nearby.  Go there instead."}
{"text":"Love the Salmon BLT...without the \"B\"
they went back to their original home cut fries which I don't prefer which is why I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5stars.
Onion rings are delish** They always get your orders right!"}
{"text":"The. Best. Burger. In. Charlotte. My only regret is not eating here sooner. After I went for the first time I ended up going back 3x that week. Customer service was good each time I was there, burger was cooked medium well which is exactly how I asked for it."}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp and it didn't have very good reviews however on the day we went we were very disappointed the restaurant was nice enough and everyone was friendly but the food lacked any real flavor it was very underseasoned It was just Bland and not exciting well I go somewhere and I'm looking for a burger I don't mind paying a price equivalent to the quality but I feel this place failed to come up to standards."}
{"text":"It was a magical experience. Kudos on having a great veggie burger so I can bring my girlfriend too. Well played Bang Bang burger."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at Bang Bang Burger and the whole family is happy. No fancy burgers. All of us got the regular bang bangs and with different sides. Burgers tasted great, no wonder they were branded \"best in Charlotte\" at the Moo & Brew festival. I enjoyed then, as I did today. The meat was flavorful and cooked just as we like.  A little on the expensive side for my taste, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Excellent food great staff nice and clean. Best burger I've had in Charlotte! All grass fed burgers no antibiotics and no hormones in the meat.

The maple sauce that comes w the sweet potato fries is amazing as is the homemade BBQ chips"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Charlotte hands down. My favs are the Hangover with fried egg and pimento cheese burger with fried pickles. Delish! Bonus for kids eat free on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I've ever had, which is a lot considering I'm putting it up there with Shake Shack and Umami. The flavor of the patty is near perfection and not too oily/greasy. I got the Bang Bang and my friend got Daily Special, a French Onion Soup burger, which was the real star of the show. The mix of toppings in addition to the original flavor is impeccable at this burger place. I'm not even tempted to look further for the best burger in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat before the hockey game. It had great reviews so we decided to try it. My three boys and husband and I all ordered different burgers and everyone of us raved about each individual burger we had. If you have to pick a side, I recommend the onion rings above all. However the french fries and the quinoa salad were amazing as well!  So glad we found  this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very very solid, DI all the way, maybe high major, I still prefer shake shack, but this is up there.  Don't be fooled by the \"strip mall\" appearance - cutting board \"plates\" are a different/nice plus."}
{"text":"This place was voted best burger place in Charlotte the last three years in a row and it shows! Their burgers are the best I've ever had. From the cowboy burger all the way the veggie burger! It is the most juiciest burger and the flavors work so well together. There fries are just as good as their burgers."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town so this was my first time at Bang Bang Burger. I had the guacamole burger!  Very good! Fries were good too."}
{"text":"Wow, very good.  I had a double Bang Bang burger (medium) and the other individual with me had a double TNT burger (medium).  The burgers were excellent, couldn't have been cooked any better.  The bun they use is a perfect compliment to their burgers.   We both got fries which were also good and they gave us a free sampling of the BBQ Chips that were great.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a good couple of times I really enjoy the food here and the atmosphere the meat quality is good the price is fair I crave these burgers it's a must try if you live here in Charlotte"}
{"text":"As often as I visit Spa & Nail next door, I have to exercise some serious willpower to not visit Bang Bang more often than I already do.

The burgers here are a real treat. I like that the menu isn't vast and expansive -- it makes me feel as though everything that is offered is curated and intentional. I've sampled a handful of the burgers over different trips and I've always been pleased with my choice. My go-to is typically the Hangover, because I can't turn down a burger with a fried egg on top. On my last visit, my date had the Bleu Burger on special, and the bacon jam/bleu cheese mixture on top made my eyes roll back. So good.

The only things keeping me from giving Bang Bang five stars are due to my gluten free lifestyle. Since a basic burger and fries won't work for me, I add a GF bun and swap quinoa for my side, and it tacks several dollars onto the bill. I'm not bothered paying around $10 for a burger, but as my total price starts creeping toward $15, it makes for a pricey lunch. Also, I understand that the gluten free buns are baked locally. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but in this case I really wish Bang Bang would go with a national supplier -- the GF buns here are dry and fall apart in my hands, while the Udi's buns at Smashburger always hold up and have better texture and flavor. 

To end on a high note, though, I'm all about the new rewards program Bang Bang has started. It's linked to your credit card, so you don't have to carry around some sort of loyalty punch card in your wallet or recite your phone number -- as long as you use the same credit card each time, your rewards are automatically tabulated. Easy peasy.

Oh! And you can order Bang Bang through Postmates, too, if you need a burger but can't make it out to Elizabeth."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but not as good as Five guys. The buns are better though. Wish my husband and  I wouldn't have used their restrooms... disgusting!!!  and not from the guests.. caked up grime and dirty water covering the trash cans and walls. We can never eat here again.."}
{"text":"Made my merry way into Bang Bang Burgers for the first time last night. Okay, well...I wasn't so merry after walking out of Heist Brewery while overhearing the hostess tell someone there was gonna be a 1:45 minute wait. I would have disappeared from hunger by then so no thanks! Note to self...reservations exist for a reason! But that's a whole other review. To be continued. Back to BBB. Rolled up around 8ish. It's your standard seat yourself setup for fast food. Nice crowd. As a matter of fact there was standing room only. Mama always said that was a good sign of good food! So we order our food to go as there was no place to seat. The space in this place is limited but that's okay we accept it & move on. The atmosphere is laid back. We put in our orders which are promptly taken. Service is decent. By the time it was almost time for our food to be up the crowd had thinned a little so we decided to dine in. The staff had no eye rolling or sucking of teeth about this change. Thumbs up. Food came up fast. Thumbs up. I ordered the Hangover burger med well w/a over easy egg & side of fries. OMG! Fries...delicious! Hurry up and review the burger you say?! I was saving the best for last. Their burger hit the bullseye for what a really great burger should be. The only metric I'm using for this is my taste buds & not some snobby foodie scientific method. Its just a damn good burger. Period. I'm a ketchup freak and there was no need 2 apply. FYI get your beer fix somewhere else though b/c a 12oz local beer ran around $7! Ouch.So people come for the food,stay for the burgers."}
{"text":"Wait! You mean I'm not in my backyard grilling a 100% grass fed beef burger?? It certainly tasted home cooked (probably better.) I ordered the Bang Bang Burger and upgraded to the grass fed beef. It came with cheese, lettuce, tomato, homemade pickle, red onion and for lack of a better descriptor, \"special sauce.\" This was a really good burger. On the side we shared the fries and the edamame, sweet potato salad. I liked the salad - it was a nice departure from typical side salady things. The fries were hand cut in-house but I just like a skinny, crispy fry. These tasted good but were on the soft side. 
BBB is certainly pricey but if you upgrade to 100% grass fed beef you're going to pay more than usual. Obviously they are interested in good quality ingredients (like canola fry oil) so you should expect to pay more.
I'll go back."}
{"text":"Food - 5
Service - 5
Value - 4

I was visiting town and my first meal was at Bang Bang Burgers.  I got the Gangam Style burger and it is perhaps the best burger I've ever had.  I was worried it might be too spicy for me since their menu says it is spicy -- but it was not spicy at all.  The pork belly was tender and paired well with the burger.  I got my burger cooked medium and I devoured the whole thing pretty quickly.  After such a hefty burger, I thought I would feel uncomfortably full and/or food coma would set it soon after...but that wasn't the case at all.  I'm surprised more places aren't offering a burger like this! Oppa Gangam Style!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre burgers. Sweet potato fries were better than the burger with their spicy mayo sauce. Otherwise, I thought the burger was very bland and nothing unique about it."}
{"text":"Decent little place. Can be very hard to find a table so be prepared. It is another one if those order at the counter and hope for a table joints. No service staff, just the counter. A very hefty price tag considering no service. Burgers were good but not great. Have had much better for much less. My wife's burger had very chewy bacon and looking slightly larger than a McDonald's quarter pounder. Onion rings were good and the fries were to die for. Hand cut and crispy. Only reason I gave them five stars."}
{"text":"Went there on the 4th of July. We had the Bang Bang Burger. It was delicious. Nice neat place. Will definitely be back to try out the other flavors"}
{"text":"Chitty chitty bang bang.  Or yummy yummy yummy I got love in my tummy.  Or better yet, and stealing from a recent Louie C K bit, \"bang-bang\" is a gluttonous treat to share with your similarly overweight brother.

This is the best burger joint in Charlotte.  Substitute freshly steamed broccoli and garlic for the fries, an extra $1 but perhaps adding a year to your life."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not all that good... I had the Gangnam Burger and I was expecting it to live up to the hype... Listed as one of the best burger restaurants, I must say I'm disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had to try a burger! It was good and tasted like high quality beef but I requested medium-well and it was medium to medium-rare.

Fries had an odd taste- a note of freezer-burn or plastic. I noticed another bad-fry comment in recent review. 

Hmmmm. This was my second visit and fries were great in past. So was chicken sandwich. 

My husband, who loves rare beef, visited recently with friends and he gave me a 5-star review!"}
{"text":"I got the burger bowl with salmon. The salmon was quite salty, and the bowl was very shallow- not enough greens for the price of the bowl at all. My boyfriend got the burger though and he said it was good"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I had the bang bang burger and my husband had the hangover burger; both were amazing! The sauces that come on the side for the sweet potato fries and the bang bang burger were killer! I'm a huge ketchup fan and didn't end up using ketchup. Good call fellow yelpers! If we come back to Charlotte I will be back at bbb!"}
{"text":"Charlotte's best burger doesn't come fancy. It's not topped with onion rings, smothered in salsa, or dipped in guacamole. Nope - it's just a perfectly cooked patty between two halves of a golden poppyseed bun, served with the usual toppings and a side of special sauce. But it's quite simply one of the best meals you'll have in the Queen City.

After reading on a local website about Bang Bang's claim to the Charlotte Burger Title, we dropped by on a recent Saturday afternoon and were pretty much blown away. My kids, picky eaters to the last, devoured every last bite of their burgers, and were raving about the meal for days (OK, maybe just hours ... but that's still huge). My only complaints were the fries (overdone and bland) and the very limited beer selection (just a couple of taps and one local brew in cans) -- not nearly enough choices to wash down this fabulous meal.

The restaurant itself is nothing to get excited about.  A cozy little dive in an unassuming strip mall on 7th Street, it has limited seating, but tables turn quickly. Which is a really good thing, because you'll won't want to wait for these fantastic burgers any longer than you have to."}
{"text":"I loved  the Seoul burger, the kimchi was just the right balance and those pickles and can i say those  pickles are wonderful. Always looking forward  to  the featured  burger of the week now that I've  been there serveral times!!"}
{"text":"Right now it's my favorite burger joint in Charlotte.  Always consistent, always good.  They have some good beer choices as well.  Kids eat free on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. Get the TNT single with fries. Easy as that."}
{"text":"Wow that was a good burger. Double patty mushroom and Swiss with fries. I was going to get a beer but at $7 a can I decided to skip it. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out with a few people ahead of us but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time at Bang Bang Burgers, it was super yummy! The onion rings were delicious! A little pricey for the size of the burger, but still very yummy!"}
{"text":"Fun burger joint. It's been featured on the food networks show. So It gets very busy and small area inside for seating but it does open up quick. Daily specials on the board. Weds - 1/2 beer. 
I had the burger bowl, which was great! Loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, hard boiled egg, bacon and guacamole topped with a grass-fed burger! Very filing- was great! Cleaned my bowl!
Hubby had a single Cowboy burger with a basket of fries- small for the price $10. Add an extra patty for $3 dollars. 
Overall good, great for the burger connoisseur with lots of different combos/toppings!"}
{"text":"Easily the best hamburger and fries I've yet had in Charlotte, although I don't eat hamburgers and fries as often as I used to. It's also convenient to Heroes Aren't Hard to Find. The space is rather cramped."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Burgers is an excellent burger place for being a franchise. They support local bakeries for their buns and use very high quality ingredients. The staff was also very friendly. We told the cashier this was our first time and he kindly explained to us all the details. I decided to eat the Portobello and Gruyere burger with a side of their sweet potato fries. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked and the sweet potato fries were excellent. The fries also came with a side of their house-made white sauce which was unique. Bang Bang Burgers served me one of the best burgers I've ever had and I will definitely revisit it during my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very simple place, no frills if you will. The menu is small but the burgers shine like they're supposed to. You walk in and order in line, get a number and claim your booth. Points for serving Coca Cola over Pepsi! I had the bang bang burger and my boyfriend had the cowboy burger. Both were cooked to perfection, it's clear the meat is high quality, and the buns don't crumble as they get soggy! The fries were hot, salty and fresh. We'd go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in over the weekend and tried the Seoul burger, double patty, and sweet potato fries.  This was a return visit, and from the previous visit I learned that the single patty left me thinking the portion of the single just wasn't enough.  The double seems like the better choice if you're hungry.  I loved the taste of the burger and the fries and the customer service was awesome but it just seems like something was missing. I left not feeling satisfied, maybe it was the value, portions, etc.  Ill surely go back and try some of the other combo's but when I want a burger, Bad Daddy's and Liberty will continue to be my go to spots."}
{"text":"This is a very unique burger place, you walk in an order your food before sitting. The atmosphere is that of a low lit date night place and the burgers are served on carving boards. Very tasty and good value. The only downside is it's hidden in the back side of a shopping center."}
{"text":"Unassuming little spot in a random strip mall off 7th St. and Pecan. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step inside, atmosphere takes over. Dimly lit with a sleek design... The menu features a variety of burgers. Be sure to check for the special burger of the week. Their beer selection is also spot on and they have a couple taps featuring local brews. 

I enjoyed the black bean quinoa burger and LOVED the green bean salad. Ted had the cowboy burger with fries. I snuck a few french fries and had serious side envy. The fries were perfectly seasoned, crunchy and hot. Yum! 

We're looking forward to visiting again and are excited to have discovered a little neighborhood gem so close to home! I think I'll try the Seoul Burger (kim chi with bulgogi sauce, green onions and pickled cucumbers) next time."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but it was at one time my favorite burger place in Charlotte. The burgers are way smaller and the prices higher. Not sure if they've changed how they are doing things this year or what. The TNT burger used to have deep fried onion rings and tons of jalapeños on it and now it has shoe string deep fried onions and a couple thinly sliced jalapeños. Nothing at all like the TNT burger I originally starting coming to this place for. Either way, won't be back again."}
{"text":"Finally I had a chance to visit Bang , Bang Burgers!!!!! I've had this place Bookmarked for almost a month. Anywho, my Fiance and I went here for date night. The food was amazing!!! He ordered the Bang Bang Burger: pretty much your All American Burger, tomato, onion, American Cheese...ohhh and homemade pickles!!!! Ok, let me be clear. I do not like pickles, however the homemade pickles here are amazing!!! I ordered the Guacamole Burger Medium-Well: comes with Shaved red onion, grilled corn salsa, guacamole, ranch! I loved the Cutting board our burgers were served on. Bottom line I look forward to coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best burgers in Charlotte.  Interesting mix of selections or build your own options.  My favorite is the Pimento Cheeseburger. It comes with thin fried pickles on it.  If your burger doesn't already come with it, make sure you ask for a side of \"Bang Bang Sauce\""}
{"text":"Had the Cowboy Burger & Wow!!!  Only planned to eat one but my willpower was too weak to resist. Slept like a baby after that fat load. Need to get my cholesterol checked & hit the treadmill now."}
{"text":"Took the family, only one of us had been previously. Everyone ordered the bang bang burger and fries with one order of sweet potato fries. Order was taken promptly and food came out pretty fast. Everyone loves their bang bang burger and the sauce. Sweet potato fries come with some kind of sweet dipping sauce that was really good. Place filled up quickly and we had people standing around waiting for tables to empty so they could sit down. Very good first visit and looking forward to returning

Update 5/18:  came back and food was again very good. However, this time we waited an eternity for our food. My best guess is 25-30 minutes for 2 burgers and fries. Luckily I was with my lovely wife and we weren't in a hurry but these are burgers and fries it should never take 30 minutes. For that reason, dropping down a star"}
{"text":"I've tried to find the best burger in Charlotte and I think Bang Bang has it. Properly cooked and with a selection of different burger creations using excellent toppings. Fries are gourmet quality. Pricing is very appropriate as well. Very fair. The Liberty has a couple very good burgers of similar quality but much higher price and not the same variety. Crepe Cellar has an outstanding burger of similar quality as well but only one option and higher priced.

If there's a better burger in town I've yet to find it."}
{"text":"I will have to say, this may be the best burger joint in Charlotte.  Their meat blend is awesome and so far everything my husband and I have tried has been mouth watering delicious.  It is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a very long time.  A walk up and order type of place, Bang Bang could easily fit into a 7th Street Market kind of atmosphere, but instead is tucked into a strip mall in Elizabeth.  After checking out the wide range of options, I settled on the most reviewed burger, the Cowboy, while my wife went with the standard Bang Bang Burger.  Both of us love sweet potato fries and went with those.

The Cowboy was incredible.  It didn't look like much, so the presentation made my subsequent (encouraged, according to a poster on the wall) food-photo a little sketchy, but it was amazing. I went with the double (thanks to reviews here) and I was stuffed, but not in a \"I want to go throw up\" kind of way.  It was satisfying.  High-quality beef, bacon, and a noticeably sharp cheddar cheese, along with the best burger-BBQ sauce... I want another one right now.  Then the sweet potato fries were amongst the best I've had, almost a fair-style fry with a maple sauce for dipping.  My wife was just as impressed with her single standard burger, so it probably doesn't matter what you try: the quality of the ingredients is excellent. 

If you like burgers, and don't mind spending around $10 for one, this is your place.  We'll bring family here when they visit, and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Tried the Hangover with house made bbq chips and we also got the  Cheeseburger Eggrolls. Everything tasted amazing, people working their were extremely nice, and the atmosphere was great. I also tried an OMB Copper and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and luckily did a Yelp search for a late Sunday lunch. The service was pleasant and helpful, while the burgers and fries were fresh and flavorful. A real plus was a gluten free bun that was light and tasty (most gluten free breads are dense and dry). We started off with more standard burgers but plan to return soon to try the more adventurous offerings."}
{"text":"Creative burgers. Had the special with chorizo and platanos. They definitely nailed it! cant wait to return. friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"The concept behind this - lean meat (80/20) (from Kansas or Oklahoma?) from a prestigious NY purveyor served medium or rare with a different take on toppings - is a good one.  Joe is very excited for this to be the best hamburger in town.

Is it?  I'm not sure. I was pleased with the Hangover Burger I got.  The homemade chips were chewy & crispy, but a bit much salt.  Their special sauce is a bit too ketchup-y.  I have had burgers that I liked better in Charlotte, but I am willing to keep an open mind and try again.  

The decor is basic wood/industrial."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just paid $10 for that cheeseburger. I love cheeseburgers. That cheeseburger was not worth anywhere near $10, the size of the patty was tiny and the quality of the food was not in line with the menu price. The chips were greasy and the bathroom was dirty. There are too many great burger places to ever go back here."}
{"text":"Simple yet good. The bun was nicely toasted, the burger was juicy and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The fries were perfectly crispy and salty. Because it was our first time we got a free sample of their homemade barbecue chips. They were warm and seasoned well-hard to stop eating!"}
{"text":"I love trying new burger restaurants, and I was thoroughly impressed with my first visit to Bang Bang Burgers. They were very reasonably priced for a counter service burger restaurant ($12-13 for double burger with fries), and the quality and flavors were amazing. I tried a double kimichi burger with a side of fries. I would highly recommend getting a double burger (1/2 lb.) because it's worth the little bit extra. The burger patties were extremely juicy and seasoned perfectly. The bacon fried kimchi was very flavorful and all of that wonderful kimchi flavor and bulgolgi sauce absorbed into the patty and made for a wonderful Korean inspired burger. The burger was garnished with some green onion and pickled cucumbers to cool your taste buds. 

I was also impressed with the side of fries. They were a generous portion and came out super fresh. I love fresh, house made fries, and that is exactly what you get at Bang Bang Burger. The fries reminded me of Five Guys minus the grease. Overall, Bang Bang Burgers has delicious, great quality burgers and fries for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend trying them, and I will definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I didn't have a bad experience really, but I don't see what all the hub bub is about. It's a pretty good burger but there was nothing abnormally good about it to me. I'm still not sure how I feel about the fries. I liked that they are obviously real and hand cut, but the crispness seemed to be of the chewy nearly teeth breaking variety. Maybe they're having a slightly off day?"}
{"text":"By far, I've just sampled the BEST BURGER I've ever eaten in my life! I cannot wait to return. The customer service was also superb...smiles, courteousness, and a genuine love for people! This place is a WINNER, and I wish this establishment much success."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious.  You will get plenty of grease with them and the fries don't hurt things either."}
{"text":"All in all a solid burger joint and i can see why this place gets rave reviews.  I ordered the Guacamole Burger with Sweet Potato fries - both were extremely good.  The burger was cooked just right and had tons of flavor.  The Guacamole ranked right up there with the best I've had with a nice blend of advocados, shaved red onions, and corn salsa.  The sweet potato fries were really good but there are other places in Charlotte that have better.  I did like the fact that they are hand cut and still had the skin.

I don't think this is the best burger joint in Charlotte but it definitely ranks up there.  If I were in the judging business - which I'm not - I would put Kickstand burgers a notch above Bang Bang.  Another edge Kickstand has over Bang Bang is the ambiance.  Bang Bang has more of a fast food feel while Kickstand is more of a sit and stay for a while restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. You order at counter and they bring the food to you. I got the cowboy burger. Comes with sharp cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon and bbq sauce on the side. Ask them to swap out the grill onions for onion rings. The onion rings are to die for! The hand cut fries are truly delicious. The interior is very intimate and can be crowded but it works. Definitely quality food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Nice fresh food and delicious tea, the poor csshier had a terrible time with our order. First she overcharged us, and then tried to credit our card for it when we paid cash. We had to keep going back but she was perfectly willing and agreeable!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Presentation is absolutely amazing, and the staff is just wonderful. My boyfriend and I went in there the other day for the first time and the cashier was so pleasant! She walked us through the whole menu and were very pleased with what we ordered.. We've been about 3 times after that and will be recommending this place to our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries! So yummy. Good size portions, healthy options, and good quick service that fits the atmosphere. Not just burgers"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a mix between chipotle and five guys. Upon entering you're guided through a short lane that leads to a counter top where you order and pay. The menu includes two draft craft beers and three or four canned local beers. You can get the drafts in 12 or 24 ounce mugs. I think the girl behind the counter said something about a beer special on Tuesday or Wednesday. She was very friendly and answered all my questions. 

I decided on a double burger of the cowboy style (onions, cheddar, bacon, and BBQ sauce) although I added an egg. For a side I substituted the standard fries for sweet potato fries for a dollar up charge. The burger was quite messy and I don't think I was a fan of the thin burgers though, it made for a slippery mess. The fries were decent, but there were a bunch of those little tiny scrappy pieces. They seemed more greasy than I prefer, but maybe that was from the burger.

I would return, but I'm not going to dream about in the mean time."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing mushroom burgers I've ever had, top 3 for sure.  Angus beef is the best. Try anything I'm sure it will be delicious.  Peace out"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened. I simply love it. The quality of the meat and the attention to details adds the right amount of deliciousness to the burger. The Bang Bang sauce is good but nothing you haven't seen before, however add it to the awesome roll and quality meat cooked to perfection and you have a dang good buger. I get there as much as possible. In the mood for a good buger try this place."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to Bang Bang Burgers!  We went for the first time last week and were blown away by the burgers and prices.  Tuesdays are kids eat free.  Bonus!  And adults can order off the kid's menu for only $2 more, which is nice.  However, the burgers on the kid's menu are the same size as the adult menu, just cooked through - another plus.  My husband ordered The Bang Bang Burger (double) and I think had a moment.....ok, maybe a few moments.  He was in heaven.  The burgers are so juicy without being greasy.  I think next time he'll be ordering the Hangover....the whole \"fried egg\" thing...not sure I get it, but whatever...it makes Big Daddy happy.  The fries too are amaze balls.  We met the chef when we walked in...and liked him immediately.  The service was excellent and I love the fact that you can fill up your own drink....a plus with kids.  This is a very unpretentious place, that welcomes kids, with reasonable prices.  A CMPD officer was even enjoying his dinner on duty.  We will definitely be back....and soon!"}
{"text":"Burgers are decent but too small and overpriced for what they are. Moo and Brew has better burgers and better value."}
{"text":"Good first visit to Bang Bang last night. The black bean patty isn't special but condiments were fresh, fries and rings were solid, and the service was very good. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Best burger I've EVER had and I've had some great ones. Went with the guacamole and it was perfection."}
{"text":"The way people talk about this place, I had to check it out! The menu is pretty simple with a handful of burgers of which you can choose a single or a double. They have about 2 beers on tap and a couple of others in cans. My boyfriend and I ordered the Pimento and the TNT and split them. Our favorite was the Pimento. Just pimento cheese and fried pickles but oh so good. He ordered a double of the pimento burger, but came out as a single. I can only do thin burgers so they are perfect as singles here. He would have liked a little more meat. Fries were perfect. 

The cashier was nice and friendly and even warned us when the beer we ordered had not been very well received. She gave us a sample before letting us commit. 

Honestly after all of the reviews and Instagram pics I have seen about this place I expected it to me more life-changing. However, it was just a pretty standard burger in my opinion. Something to be said for consistency though! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love!  Best hamburger and sweet tea ever!  Great staff too!  

This place rocks.  Great menu, interesting combinations.   He food was fresh and prepared very well.  The staff was fun and very proud of their work and they should be too.

I will be back a lot!"}
{"text":"Cozy place, and in fact can get a little too much so if they are busy, as there just isn't that much room, so you might want to try and find an off time if you don't want to wait in line and/or for a table. Once you're in, you probably will not wait long for your meal, however, as it is served up quickly - a nice touch. It also is a good presentation.

Cashiers are helpful with ordering, which can be useful, as the menu, while not overwhelming, is not entirely straightforward either. For instance, a pimento sounds a bit like a grilled cheese sandwich, but it's really a cheeseburger. A pork belly sounds like a pork sandwich, but it's pork on top of a burger, and so on. Not difficult, per se, but just needs that extra 'umph' to get the point across.

As has been mentioned, they cook burgers medium (or medium well). Medium rare would be nice. Fries are tasty. Burgers are on the small side, which isn't bad, but for the price, can seem like you aren't getting much for your order."}
{"text":"Short version: good burgers, good service, nice place.

We got the guacamole burger and the cowboy burger, and the kids got a grilled cheese. Everything was fresh and made just right. It wasn't crowded when we got there, but pretty soon after that it started filling up. The service was fast, and very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! No wonder they named their restaurant after the sauce (my assumption)... it's delicious! Good selection of gourmet-style burgers. Hand cut fries and sweet potato fries. Totally unique stuff too - like the cheeseburger eggroll, side of broccoli, quinoa salad, burger bowls, and 100% grass fed beef! Awesomeness all around! Good service with a smile. No harassment when asking for multiple refills of the Bang Bang sauce. Cool contemporary rustic decor. Definitely recommend! Even if you don't want a burger, they have chicken, salmon and black bean patties!!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet review. Best burger I have had in a long time. 
Can't wait to try some different burgers here soon!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit. Stopped in with my son after a walk. Told the young man behind the counter it was our first time and he took the time to explain the menu. The only thing better than the customer service is the food. Yes, it's a bit pricey but it's worth every cent! 


The sweet potato fries are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. I've never been disappointed and go as often as I can. To have a burger with this quality of meat cooked to medium perfection with completely fresh and original toppings, what else could one ask for?

The fries, the onion rings, everything is delicious. Make sure to get some Bang Bang Sauce to dip your fries in for something a little different.  

Oh, and never forget to the check the chalk board when you walk in to the right for the daily burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here during a recent visit to Charlotte.  The burger were excellent and well portioned and the beer menu was good with several local options.  The cashier was very helpful in explaining the way the menu worked."}
{"text":"I wanted to get the Hangover style (egg, bacon, hash, etc.), so I opted for the bean patty to mitigate a future heart attack. I personally thought it was a great combo even with the cashier's warning that wasn't a very popular duo. The egg was cooked nicely as over easy, even though I saw some pics on Yelp with an overcooked and unappetizing egg. So the burger was great and filling. I upgraded to the onion rings and I shouldn't have. The wife got the regular burger and fries, and I ended up eating more of her fries than the rings. There was too much batter and it ended up ruining the onion.

However, I did ask what type of oil they use to fry their items due to a nut/soy allergy, and they indicated using a blend of canola and rice bran oil. After a quick google search on rice bran oil, I found out it's good quality oil with some health benefits. So if I'm going to eat fried food, might as well eat some healthier cooking oil. The interior and atmosphere is nothing special as it's more of a fast casual spot. Glad I tried it and would recommend it, but only warrants an occasional return for me."}
{"text":"Have only had their veggie bean burger since I don't eat meat. Since many of my friends are meat eaters this is a great place since their veggie friendly option is very tasty"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I just ate the highest quality burger of my life at a place where you have to order at the counter and the burger only cost $9. 
I was immediately impressed upon ordering at Bang Bang Burgers. I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!
I don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. 
The sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. 
Overall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well."}
{"text":"Well it wasn't the worst burger I've ever had, but it was FAR, FAR from the best.  I had the guacamole burger with onion rings and my husband had the hangover burger with fries.  We were both disappointed.  The guacamole on the burger was kind of bland, the burger was bland. My onion rings were super oily. So much so that I only ate 2. I just wasn't feeling it. It is all highly overpriced for what you get.  I've had better, less expensive burgers elsewhere. It's also a big turnoff that you have to pay extra for grass-fed beef. I won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers that are reasonably priced! Everything tastes fresh and the service is great. We've never had to wait super long for our food. I've had the mushroom and Swiss burger which was underwhelming but still good and the guacamole which was awesome. The fries are also killer. Management seems so sincere when you read their social media posts and the notes on the tables warning guests about getting towed given the horrendous parking situation in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We ate at Bang Bang Burgers for the first time last night!  Delicious!!!  We ordered the Bang Bang Burger, TNT Burger, and the Burger Bowl.  All great!!  One of the best or maybe actually the best burger that we have ever eaten.  The menu is limited but we are all looking forward to going back.  The staff was very helpful when we asked questions.  When they found out it was our first time there, someone brought over a sample of their wonderful homemade BBQ potato chips while we waited for our food.  We also received a sample of their delicious quinoa which has almonds and dried cranberries in it.  The sweet potato fries dipped in their special maple sauce was incredible!"}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised with this place. It seems like it took awhile to open, sometimes that works against a restaurant. I was able to meet the owner and he explained things to me. They get their beef from a butcher in NYC and it is very good. Not a huge patty but you do have the easy option to add a 2nd patty. Their buns are from Local Loaf in the 7th St. Market. Two things are great about this. 1st the bread is so good!! it's got good texture and a flaky buttery top. It's made fresh everyday. 2nd is that it's from Local Loaf. 

The ambiance was cool. Nice contemporary lighting. Nice wooden eating tables and planting of seating. They also had a good beer selection. This is a great addition to the burger scene in CLT.  Oh and really good fries too!"}
{"text":"I have to say I love burgers and I've eaten a lot of them. This was the best burger I've had in my life thus far! It is such a small place inside not many tables but I would recommend this place to everyone. I can't wait to go back and when my family comes to Charlotte to visit I want to take them to Bang Bang Burgers! I hope they are able to expand to be bigger in the near future. Good job guys keep doing what you are doing!"}
{"text":"So, who has Charlotte's best burger? Yeah, I'm not throwing my hat into that debate and proclaiming a winner. I will say Bang Bang Burgers is definitely in the conversation. 

This place is kind of tucked away in a little strip mall on 7th Street. The menu isn't huge, but it's still a burger lover's dream. For you non-burger folks, there are a few options for you. Key word: few (chicken sandwich, salmon blt, quinoa black bean veggie burger, and salad). I usually get a mushroom swiss burger or the bang bang burger (bangburger sauce is a must). I'm a big fan of the onion rings here. Parents, kids eat free on Tuesdays. 

I love the presentation. The burgers come out on little wood cutting boards. Local beer options. The workers are really friendly. This parking lot can get kind of crazy during the day. If you're trying to go left on 7th Street coming out of here, make sure you exit on the Pecan Street side and hit that red light. It'll save you the headache of trying to pull out into the 7th Street traffic."}
{"text":"What to do on a rainy day off from work with the boyfriend...I know! Enjoy takeout while binging on our new tv show.

Bang Bang Burgers delivered just that. As a vegetarian, I was excited to see so many burger options, all of which could be made with a black bean patty. I was very satisfied with calling and placing a takeout order - they got everything right, down to the substitutions and additions. The burgers we ordered (Seoul and TNT) were both yummy. The quinoa salad was also a nice surprise! I recommend ordering it if you're looking for a lighter option than fries.

Overall, good food and it was a perfect fit for lounging on the couch with takeout."}
{"text":"So disappointed by our most recent visit. They have removed the Gangnam Style burger and really sanitized what used to be a semi eclectic menu. But what really did it for me was the $7 chicken \"tenders\" and fries basket that we got for my son - the \"tenders\" were shaped nuggets (think McDonald's). After mentioning it to staff, they admitted that the menu may be misleading, but that was it. While both my husband and I weren't unhappy with our food, there wasn't anything that impressed us either. We usually go here every couple of months, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered an apple compote burger and a 22oz OMB.

Service: For being an order-at-the-counter style, service was quick. The server was friendly in advice off the menu, being my frist time there.

Wait time: Food didn't take too long to come out, though I was in on a Sunday and it was not busy (two other tables). I want to say I waited about ten minutes for food.

Burger: The burger toppings were delicious. A delightful combination. The patties themselves, I felt, could have been better. They seemed like the same variety you find at a Burger King. Though not terrible, for the price I felt like the meat should have been fresher. There were also only two temperatures, medium or medium well, that could be obtained. This wasn't a deal breaker, but I almost always get a medium rare. Again, the patties were too small to be able to do this. I would have liked to see a freshly packed patty. 

Side: Sweet potato fries were just so-so. About a fourth were burnt and tasteless, the rest were fresh and delicious. I won't make assumptions as to why, just was the way it was. 

All in all, it wasn't perfect but it was still quite good. I will probably stick to Cowfish or Bad Daddy's for my burger retreat, but if I'm ever need of a good burger on that side of town, I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Amazing new burger joint in the Elizabeth neighborhood. I've been multiple times now and it just keeps getting better. Top notch beef from world renowned butcher Pat La Frieda...there's not a better beef blend in the country IMO. Fries are great as well. Handcut, crispy and fresh every time. But what keeps bringing me back is the Bang Bang sauce. It's an amazing spicy mayo/thousand island/who knows, but it's incredible. 

A well needed unique restaurant in the Elizabeth neighborhood. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This new little burger joint in Elzabeth neighborhood is a nice addition.  It's reasonably-priced and has a few varied things on their menu without the menu feeling cluttered.  My first visit, which must have been obvious, the cashier talked me through how the menu and service worked.  She even offered to give me a sample of their potato chips  because i was having a difficult time deciding on my side item.  I ended up getting a cowyboy burger or something like that which had BBQ sauce bacon and sauteed onion.  It was delicious.  At first, I was kinda over the way that it was not served on a plate, but on something that resembled a cutting board.  I thought that it would have been an inconvenience to eat....but it really wasnt.   Overall, very good....i wish they had maybe one or two other types of burgers on the menu....perhaps in the future....for people with varied tastes like mine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Hubby and I went for lunch. We got the bang bang burger and the pork belly burger, both with fries. Fries were crispy in the outside and great. Bun/meat balance was perfect. The girl at the counter explained the menu so great that I wanted to order everything, she was also were courteous. The beef had char grill flavor. I had a single patty and it was enough for me, the hubby order a double and he was full. The fries serving is huge. Food is served in wooden board to make it look rusty. I will definitely be coming back. Also, they serve Coke products \"My favorite\"."}
{"text":"Love this burger place! One of the best burger spots in the city. The quality of the meat is so good that even the most simple, plain burger tastes like a gourmet treat. 

My go to is the cowboy burger. The combination of their great beef patty, crispy bacon and tangy bbq sauce is exactly what the taste buds need for a dank meal. The portion sizes are great too. I never leave hungry. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out today. Got takeout. Had the TNT And the cowboy burger. The tnt burger was insanely delicious. The sauces were solid, and i appreciate that for takeout they were put on the side. Definitely going back to dine in next time."}
{"text":"While in town visiting family, I had a hankering for a good burger and my fellow Yelpers led me to Bang Bang Burgers.  BEST DAY EVERRRR!  These burgers are something serious!  Since it was our first time, the cashier introduced us to the menu and their beer selection.  I settled on the Bang Bang burger, medium, single patty.  It was the perfect size (I cannot stand thick patties) and cooked to perfection.  The meat was so juicy and flavorful.  I tried the Bang Bang sauce by itself- it's some sort of relish, mayo, concoction- and I didn't really like it but when I spread it on the bun it brought the entire burger together in a glorious way!  These guys really know what they are doing!  I liked that the fries were homemade but I would have preferred a little more uniformity.  By the time I got to the bottom, my fries looked more like little shreds of potato.  But whatever, I went for the burger and I was not disappointed.

I can't go without mentioning that no one at our table said a word as we were devoured our food.  There was no time for conversation- my only focus was savoring each bite!  I will definitely be back next time I come to town."}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers often but when i do it's gotta be a great chargrilled burger which is what u get here. 
This place is very clean, the staff are very friendly and the burgers are so tasty that u don't need ketchup or anything one it."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger! And reviews told me this was the best place in town to fill that craving.  I was not disappointed.  The burgers were huge, the place is very casual.  Fun spot over all."}
{"text":"Friendly service: check 
Good burger: check
Walking distance to my house: check 

This place has it all. Fast, clean, friendly, and good burgers. I had the guacamole burger, which I loved. Be aware that (for a burger joint) the portions aren't huge. It was enough to leave me stuffed, but if you like your meal super sized, you might want to get a double patty burger. Finally, I give four stars instead of five because the regular fries are light on flavor and heavy on grease. I'll go for sweet potato fries next time."}
{"text":"Love Bang Bang, and even love it as a vegan now! Their black bean burger is so good, especially bc many restaurant veggie burgers aren't vegan (contain egg). Theirs is vegan and I usually get the guacamole one and it is SO filling.  Also love their fries--super good! Wish they had vegan honey mustard or some other type of sauce besides ketchup or bbq, but otherwise no complaints!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger place that I've been to in Charlotte so far.  I've also tried Kickstand in Plaza-Midwood, but I think Bang Bang is better overall.

I've tried the Cowboy burger and the special Mexicali burger.  Both were great.

I've seen some complaints on the burger size in other reviews and they are definitely smaller than some places (I'm guessing 1/4 pound size for a single); however, I certainly find the size to be sufficient when you pair it up with a side item.

The overall quality of the meat is great, and the ingredient combinations on the various burgers are excellent.  I'm a big fan of sweet potato fries and this place has the BEST ones I've had, especially when eating them with the accompanying maple white sauce.  I don't know exactly what's in this sauce but it is heavenly.

The only real knock I have on this place is it's located in a strip mall, and has a vibe similar to Five Guys or any other chain.  Great for lunch or hanging out with your bros, but I wouldn't take a date here."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, but not the greatest. They are fairly small. The place is small and have a few tables, but do not come here with a large Mormon family expecting to be able to find seating for everyone. Either way, the prices are standard and I have nothing much to say than the burgers were good, but as a burger lover...my mind was not blown away. Still searching for the best of the best. But I will come back here one of these days."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite burger places in the charlotte area. The burgers are so rich with flavor. I've been here several times and always love getting the cowboy burger because it has bacon and cheese. My only complaint is that the fries are pretty tough making them alright. But if you want a great burger and don't care if it's not huge then this is your place!"}
{"text":"The Cowboy Burger was juicy and delicious. The fries seemed over cooked and hard. I would come back."}
{"text":"Best burger place I have been to. Got the Hangover burger cooked exactly as I asked. The fries are perfectly cooked also. The Bang sauce is highly recommended. More expensive than most places, but worth it."}
{"text":"Perfectly toasted buns. Crispy, yet soft and yielding. Ordered guacamole burger and fries, but will get healthier quinoa salad my wife got next time. Very tasty with almond slivers and sweet accents from cranberries and something else. Food came out promptly and all at once. Was a little disappointed burger did not come with lettice or tomato, but perhaps that was to avoid cloaking the excellent flavor of the La Frieda beef patty. At $10 for a single patty expensive, but worth it. 

Also like that they offer Coke fountain drinks. 

Glad it was Sunday and Showmars was closed or we would not have tried it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Nothing is ever frozen and everything is fresh every day. Not only was the food fantastic but the service was as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After eating here about ten times I've finally decided they have the best burgers in charlotte. I've worked my way through the menu and I can say with confidence every burger will satisfy!! My personal favorites are the hangover over and the pimento burgers. 

This place definitely has a lot of hype and I can assure you it lives up to it. Definitely not a cheap burger, but you are paying for what you get. A well thought out, fresh burger."}
{"text":"After hearing some positive feedback from friends, I finally tried out this burger joint.  Well, it lived up to my expectations!  The burgers were super-juicy and DEE-Lish...and so were the fries.  I even liked the overall rustic-style presentation (check out my pics).  I also had to try their \"Cheeseburger Eggroll\"...Very cute concept, with cute presentation as well!  The only thing that can be improved is SPACE.  The place was very small, and way too crowded for comfort.  I could hear every word the people next to me had to say (and vice versa, I'm sure).  I think the owner should think about expanding this little burger joint to a bigger facility, possibly even opening up several branch locations.  Yes, THAT good!

PS**I spoke too soon...I just checked their website, and they do have a second location in Southend Charlotte now!"}
{"text":"I left Bang Bang Burgers somewhat unsatisfied. Usually, any burger joint that offers a variety of different styles of burgers makes me content but this place just didn't fulfill my expectations. The dining experience was the same as one would have going to a five-guys or a burger-fi. Their choices of burgers incorporates a lot of Asian fusion so I give them a thumbs up for trying. I had the \"Gangnam Style\" burger and thankfully chose their double patty option (additional couple of dollars). Even with double patties, I felt like I was paying way too much for the amount of meat I was getting. Yes I know it's organic-grass fed beef and I believe it ---but for the price, I don't know if it was quite worth it. Even though the burger had some greens (too little, in my opinion), the pork-belly and the beef patty combined made the burger overly greasy. Three out of the four in my party got the \"Gangnam Style\" burger and we all agreed that the burger wasn't all that great. My girlfriend even had somewhat of an upset stomach after her dining experience at Bang Bang. Peculiarly, the highlight of my visit here were the onion rings which were crunchy and delicious but not over-battered, so I can recommend those. Still, at any burger restaurant, the consumer shouldn't be raving about the onion rings over the burgers.

Overall, a \"meh\" experience. I am open to the idea of coming back and trying different burgers but for now, it'll be at the bottom of my list in places to visit when I go back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Burger was small, soggy, and pathetic. Was really looking forward to this place based on the reviews and pictures but it was just bad. They should rename themselves \"bad bad burgers.\" The fries were good but I can't give them 2 stars because it is a burger place. 

I imagine that whoever voted them best burger took their food as a suppository because no one with taste buds could enjoy it. 0/10 would not eat again."}
{"text":"Perfect burger. I got a double Hangover. The beef was tender and delicious, and the ingredients came together in perfect harmony. One of the top 2 burgers I've ever had! Also, the fries were just right, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte! Between the meat and the bun it doesn't get much better! Always check the special burger of the week but the regulars are always a solid choice. Fries are awesome, too. Employees are great which makes it even more pleasant!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Bang Bang Burgers for some time since they opened, and since I finally tried them, I've already been back in less than a week.  Yes, their burgers are THAT good.

My husband and I have had their guacamole, cowboy, Seoul, and one special burger (an outstanding fried green tomato/avocado/arugula burger).  My brother and his wife joined us the second time, both of them getting the hangover burger.  Their burgers are juicy and delicious, even if they only cook them to medium or well doneness.  I didn't realize the guacamole burger didn't come with cheese, so next time I'll add pepper jack for an extra kick.

And thinking of their fries and onion rings is enough to make me salivate. Their rings are coated with a tempura batter and fried till crispy.  Their fries are thin and very crispy as well.  While ketchup is a mainstay, I prefer to dip my fries and rings in their homemade chipotle ranch.  Yum!

They showcase beers from local breweries (Old Meck) and serve them in frosted glasses.  And service at this little place is super friendly.  We'll definitely be visiting Bang Bang Burgers more regularly now!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the best burger I've ever had. I went simple and just got the Bang Bang Burger. It was seriously perfect. Juicy, well seasoned, really good sauce to go on it, crazy good bun, and just overall amazing beef flavor! Sooo good! The fries were fantastic too. Kind of like 5 Guys fries, but with a sea salt grinder and a fresh black peppercorn grinder right at the table to put on the fries!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Always an awesome burger, amazing sides & great local beers on tap. If you have not been here yet, you need to go have a burger at Bang Bang Burger!"}
{"text":"Tried this out today and absolutely loved it.  Had the bang bang burger- it was perfection.  Great bun, grain fed beef- absolutely delicious.  I also had the sweet potato fries which came with a honey mustard sauce.  Well done- will definitely be back."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars for me.  :)

We rarely go out for lunch on purpose on Saturdays or Sundays.  There has to be either a)extra cash flow and/or b) a good reason.  Going to Bang Bang Burger this past Saturday was because of both A and B.

Upon walking in, I was a little throw off by the decor and the interior set up but I quickly remembered that it's just a simple burger joint.  So then the decor made more sense.  Ordering was easy.  The menu isn't that extensive, yet, but I'm sure as they find their \"voice\" if you will, it'll grow.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger and hubs ordered another burger...I forgot.  The cool thing was that when I asked if they could just skip using a bun on mine, they told  me they could do a burger wrap.  Huh??  OK!! Let's try it.  

My little burger lettuce wrap hit just the spot.  It was just the right size of meat to lettuce ratio and the meat quality was great.  It melted in my mouth.  My Hubs burger, on the other hand...was all bun...hardley any meat.  Where's the beef??  Reading the reviews, they suggest getting the double meat and it would be better.  We also order a beer (yes in the middle of the afternoon..why not?) and mine was GOOD! I think I got the one with the Monkey on it.  LOL! Can't remember the name.  The Bang Bang burger sauce was nothing more than 1,000 island dressing...which they admit to, but they make it in-house.  Sorry but it threw me back to my McDonald days and eating a big mac and it's \"special sauce\"...aka....1,000 island dressing.  I'll pass....

We spoke for a long time with Joe and we loved his passion for really wanting to bring a different type of burger joint to CLT.  We liked Bang Bang and will come back if we're ever in that area.  Great little addition to that area."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger fan, but I LOVE the Gangnam Style burger. I highly recommend you get that if you love Asian food and something out of the ordinary. (I don't like boring burgers). 

It has a slice of pork belly, which was cooked perfectly both times I went! I devoured the burger pretty quickly so you know it's good. My friend got the burger with kimchi in it, but it wasn't anything special. I think I will have to get double patty next time because the single patty burger didn't fill me up that much. 

Cons: I really wish this place was bigger. I had trouble finding seating the first time I went. Also, the fries are pretty plain, nothing that special. Too many fries for the size of the burger. Other than that, you should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places to go to! I drive 40 minutes at least once a week to eat here, and it never disappoints! Great food, and pretty decent prices."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever tasted.  The fries are cooked to perfection.  Well worth the drive across Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very quick service. I am very picky about meat and my burgers so I wasn't expecting to be very thrilled. It was a nice surprise to have an awesome burger that I finished and was very satisfied with. Delicious!!!!! I had the Seoul! Loved!! Also the sweet potato fries and maple dip?!!! Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad burger. I love their \"Bang Sauce\" (even though it's basically just Thousand Island). Their sweet potato fries are great and come with a delicious maple cream cheese sauce for dipping.  What I like the most is they have a different specialty burger each week (which they post on Twitter & Instagram) so the options change often. Very creative and inventive burgers that taste great!  Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Comparable to Bad Daddy's or Five Guys. Similar pricing too."}
{"text":"Move Over Bad Daddy's Burger Bar...this place is taking the #1 award in my book for BURGERS!  Where have I been all this time, this place was incredibly delicious.  The beef patties are seasoned to perfection!  We got the grass fed beef, a little more pricy but worth every penny.  The TNT burger was the best, make it a double with lettuce/tomato/guacamole and it was to die for.  I also got the quinoa side salad instead of fries.  All this with a CAVU beer to go with it made my Friday night!  I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Pros:
Quick 
Moderately priced

Cons:
I've had better burgers. Mine was soggy and undercooked. 
It's basically glorified fast food."}
{"text":"I was visiting ATL & in the hotel room I was watching the food network and this restaurant was featured on diners drive in & dives & I quickly got excited because I've been looking for hot spots here in Charlotte. I quickly wrote down the name and saved it in my notes. 

2 months later I finally came to see what all the fuss was about & omg the fuss is real I got the Swiss mushroom burger with spicy mayo & home fries. I absolutely enjoyed the burger. It was so juicy!! Also the cheese platter boards are so cute, it adds the perfect touch.

Service was quick - no long lines. Sunday around 8pm is the perfect time to go. I def plan on going back to try their other burgers"}
{"text":"I only Yelp if it's terrible and out of line or if it's off the chain. Well, this place is off the chain. This place is addicting. Best burger and fries ever. Period. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Found Bang Bang Burgers on Yelp a while back and finally had a chance to go today after the Spring Home & Garden show at The Park Center. Bang Bang Burgers is only about a mile away. So glad we tried it today. Burgers were delicious and made to order. The fries were delicious. The onion rings looked good too, so I'll definitely have to try those next time. The space is small, but the tables turn over pretty quickly and I never saw anyone have to wait for a table even though they were busy. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time patronizing Bang Bang Burgers. I quickly noticed the trendy ambiance of this place. I had no issues while ordering. The cashier was very helpful and kind. 

I ordered the Bang Bang Burger and my wife ordered the Cowboy Burger. It did not take very long before we received our order. I was quite surprised to see how they were served. I thought that was a very good idea. Although, I should have known if I would have paid more attention to the pics that many of you all have posted lol.

My burger was fantastic! It was one of the best burgers I've had that wasn't cooked by my wife or mother-in-law (seriously they make the best burgers!). I liked how they set it up where you add the toppings and sauces to your specifications.

I also ordered the onion rings instead of the fries. The onion rings were top notch. If they weren't the best I've had, then they were definitely in the top 3. 

All in all, I enjoyed my visit and intend to come back soon."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good, the fries are really good and the beer/wine selection is good.  I usually don't need more than that, but the kids like coming here, too, so that seals the deal for us.
Oh, and don't forget that it is a burger place, and the burgers are rrreally good..."}
{"text":"We loved the service, burgers and price of this place. My fella went with the ganghum style burger and I had a regular pimento cheese burger. We both loved them. They were cooked to order, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. The fries were also good and there were a ton of condiments available. The prices were more than reasonable and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. 

Two things that would've made this place better - a bigger beer selection and better desserts. We bought a cookie to share but it was so dry and hard that we ended up throwing it away. 

All around, this place was great and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"had the pork belly burger
i felt that the beef patty was super small for the bun but it was flavorful.. maybe next time i'll get the double patty
the sweet potato fries could have been better.. not super crispy but the dipping sauce was yummy

overall, an OK burger that satisfied by burger craving but not the best"}
{"text":"I should have tried this place sooner considering I live within walking distance. I had their burger at the Moo & Brew festival but if I am being completely honest, I was feeling pretty good after all those beer samples. So I couldn't write a review because 1- I wasn't sober enough to critique it and anything would have tasted divine at that moment, and 2- I wouldn't have remember what it tasted like.  Hands down the best burger in all of Charlotte. It's a walk up and order style restaurant with maybe 3 or 4 taps.  The lady that took my order was helpful and gave me the run down on the most popular burger. I of course ordered the Bang Bang Burger with a OMB Copper.  First, what is that Bang Bang sauce because I want to put it on everything. Wow!!! And second, where has this place been all my life. It is no surprise that they have won the best burger at the Moo & Brew fest two years in a row. If you haven't ventured out to Elizabeth to give this burger a try, you're missing out!  Cheers to extra hours at the gym and becoming a regular at this joint."}
{"text":"The burgers were okay.  I had the Bang Bang Burger.  They have small patties and the Bang Bang sauce tastes like potato salad. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a burger.  I did like their fries.... Their fries reminds me of Five Guys.  

The staff was very friendly and even gave us a sample of their BBQ chips since this was my husband and I first time there.   Overall, the food wasn't bad... It just didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"This is a small \"walk up to the counter and order\" burger place, with limited seating.  (Parties of more than 4 would probably have a pretty hard time.) There's not a ton of options, but the ones they have all sounded really good. I ended up getting the Cowboy burger, but was actually disappointed - to me the \"BBQ sauce tasted way more like tomato pasta sauce. So in reality, I just had a bacon cheeseburger... But a really good bacon cheeseburger. The bun was perfectly toasted, the bacon was perfectly crispy, and the patty was actually just a tiny bit over medium. (I requested it medium, and they were closer than other burger places we've tried.) My husband ordered the guacamole burger and loved it - and his was actually a prefect medium. (He decided to not get the ranch dressing that normally comes on it though.)  The Bang Bang Sauce is awesome though!  We also ordered onion rings and sweety potato fries.  Skip the rings (slightly underdone and super greasy), but the sweet fries were really good and they come with their own sauce (maple cream - definitely try it. ) 
The patties are pretty thin, and it's a little expensive for what you get, but all in all, we were happy we tried it, and will likely be back."}
{"text":"Grass fed burger was tasty and the cheeseburger egg rolls are a great appetizer. Price point might be a dollar or two high, but it was a fun, quick dinner."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever!!! Absolutely delicious! My hubby ordered the Hangover which had a fried egg in it, yum! I ordered the black bean burger and it was to perfection! My favorite was how they put quinoa salad inside the burger. It was pretty packed on a Saturday night but we still got a table. The service was nice and friendly and our order was on point! We shall return!"}
{"text":"Small warm and cozy. It wasn't overly busy when we arrived but I appreciated the dedicated parking that allowed us to get right in without driving around the block a dozen times like a lost dominoes pizza delivery person. (Notice the gender neutral noun- you're welcome ladies) Ordering was a cinch. Small deliberate menu and it really shows off they do a small number of items really really well.
Ordered the hangover burger with tempura onion rings. Burger was phenomenal. Juicy hot and super flavorful even without the bang bang sauce. Adding the sauce just made it even better. I also got a side of pimiento cheese and it was sensational as well.
Presentation was nice on a carving board with a metal basket of onion rings. The rings were light and crispy and delicious. I can't find one thing I didn't like. We will definitely be back to enjoy another option."}
{"text":"Finally tried the famous bang bang burger!
Very tasty, and the fries were fresh to death and on point  The bang bang sauce itself was a great little addition for both the burger and to dip the fries in. Cooked to the exact temperature we had asked for and the toppings were a great touch on the side for those who prefer to eat it more plain. Needless to say - We will be back!"}
{"text":"On a business trip to CLT and had s few hours to kill so I found this place to get lunch. I got the Cowboy Burger. Overall the burger was really good. Ingredients were fresh and bbq sauce was unique but delicious. The hand cut fries weren't as good as id hoped. They were fried (obviously) but didn't have too much flavor in and of themselves. I was gonna go with sweet potato fries but I decided against the $1 up charge. That's probably on me. Seating feels a little cramped as they try to fit a lot of tables into a small space. But it's not uncomfortable. I dig the vibe though and would stop in again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I got rid of the bang bang sauce in favor of mustard and I thought the burger was very flavorful and the meat just melted in my mouth and with the bun the flavor was excellent. I could imagine that the bang bang sauce would over power the burger, hence I left it off, plus I am more of mustard guy anyway. I will come back and try something more adventurous than just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, and onion."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service and I think I just had the best burger I've ever put in my mouth. I got the special which was a stuffed jalapeño burger and it was the bomb. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Today was my lucky day, I have been waiting to come here forever but I was never in the area. Now, I can't wait to go back! With so many burger and fast food places nowadays it's hard to find a burger done right. Bang bang    Burgers though, they do it right! 

Upon walking in, we noticed the place was packed so we were a little worried we wouldn't have a place to sit but luckily as we got done ordering a table opened up. Even though they were busy, our food was out in 5-10 min. I ordered the single bang bang burger- medium with sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked well on the out side and perfectly medium/pink in the middle. If I was super hunger, I'd definitely try the double, but the single filled me up just fine. The sweet potatoes were crispy and had a great bite to them. They came with a white sauce which at first I thought was ranch but it was sweet and complimented the sweet potatoes so well. 

You know how sometimes you try a new place and you want to try something new every time you go there- well, this isn't the case, I've found my perfect burger and I want that every time I go there."}
{"text":"Yum yum  great little burger spot with lots of tvs and great music  hand cut fries were DELICIOUS and the seasoned hamburger patty on my Cowboy burger  definitely had me thinking about the next visit! Washed it all down with an ice cold cherry Fanta"}
{"text":"My vote for best burger in town will always go to Bang Bang.. But you don't have to trust me because all Charlotte agrees with me as they have won the best burger two years in a row. If you are a fan of burgers then you will soon be a fan of Bang Bang as soon as you visit!

Upon arriving you'll notice that as far as curb appeal goes they aren't trying too hard. They have their sign and a few small tables outside making it look like a typical small cafe. Inside is very calm and inviting. Their menu is super simple and they even have a flat screen previewing what your burger will look like. And the pictures are spot on unlike what you see in a pizza commercial and what you actually get. 

You get your burger and fries (included) on a wooden plank and have ample places to choose to sit. The booths are super comfy and there is room for large groups at the tables. They have three TVs all unfortunately located on one wall so only half the restaurant can view them. 

It's hard to choose which burger but all of them will leave you satisfied. And if choosing a burger isn't hard enough choosing one of their many sauces will be tough too! Don't forget to drink a local Charlotte beer while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Someone called me crazy because all I get is the Bang Bang Burger, but I cant help it! It was the first one I had and it was amazing! I appreciate an amazing burger and this place does it!  I love the sweet potato fries too. I don't think I have any complaints about this place. The staff are always friendly and helpful when needed. I love the bang bang sauce too. Just go here. Seriously."}
{"text":"Bang Bang is located in an unassuming shopping center in Elizabeth, but don't let that fool you. This is one of the best burger spots in Charlotte. 

One or two perfectly cooked La Freida beef patties, delectable toppings depending on your choice of burger, and freshly baked buttery toasty bun. Melt in your mouth goodness. God, I want one again right now and it's 9am as I'm writing this. 

My wife had the Bang Bang Burger and I had the TNT burger, both were fantastic. The burger came plated on a cutting board and accompanied with a single serving sized fryer basket of fries. 

You order at the counter and they bring food out to your table, so you can save a little on tip compared to a full service restaurant.

Overall, a new favorite. We will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy burger! 

We went here with friends the other night for dinner, and we were pleased with the burgers and food we got. We went on Wednesday, and they had half price craft beer! Bingo!

The place is small inside, so I have a feeling sometimes it gets quite busy. You order at the counter and then seat yourselves. 

We ordered the Gangnam style burger and the pimento cheese burger. We got one with regular fries and one with sweet potato fries. The pimento cheese burger was definitely the hero. The gangnam style burger wasn't as great as we had hoped. We expected a bit more from the pork belly. The fries were perfectly crispy and yummy. Bang bang sauce is a must. 

Overall, great burgers. Next time, I think we will get a double pimento cheese instead of two singles to split b/c the pimento cheese was the star."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. I like their Korean spin on burgers, they are cooked perfectly. The buns are never soggy and the burgers aren't so packed with toppings that you can't eat them. I've yet to find a burger that rivals them in charlotte."}
{"text":"I really think Bang Bang Burgers burgers are the best in town. Bang Bang is little place on the edge of Elizabeth/Plaza Midwood in a weird little shopping center across from Crisp. It's one of those places that looks like a place you would definitely pass on by if it wasn't for the Yelp reviews. I was really hungry when I got there so perhaps my judgment was slightly impaired so I tried it a second time to be sure. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger (upgraded to 100% grass fed beef), a gluten free bun (not, gluten sensitive but limiting wheat in my diet these days) and of course the fries. The burger was just soooo good it's hard to adequately explain in words -- and the fries, only slightly less wonderful than the burger, did not disappoint. Everything, EVERYTHING! was ridiculously good. I left feeling like I just had one of the best meals ever (because, at the end of the day, is there anything better than meat & potatoes?)  With my \"upgrades\" I spent about $15 and it was well worth it. 

When I returned, I ordered one of the veggie burgers. It wasn't bad at all but it was what it was. If you are a meat eater, do yourself a favor and get the burger @ Bang Bang. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I am a bit disappointed about my last visit. My favorite burger was the Seoul burger, which was absent from their online menu when I ordered yesterday. I chose the pimento burger instead and it was just good. When I got to the restaurant to pick my order up, i saw the Seoul 2.0 burger on their print menu at the restaurant, which I probably would have enjoyed way more than the pimento burger I had. I said something to the effect of \"oh this one wasn't on the menu online, I would have totally ordered it instead of the pimento\" and the got replied with \"it should have been on the update\". I wish I would have known."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers who said the burgers were overpriced for the size. Other than the lettuce,  tomato,  pickles and onion that came with my burger I couldn't really tell the difference in size between my son's kids meal burger and mine.  It was  literally the same size patty for double the cost.  And it could be just me, but I felt like the place was still trying to define itself... Like it wanted to serve \"high class\" fare with a \" low class\"  ambiance. Unfortunately,  the only thing high class about it was the price."}
{"text":"I am going to go ahead and start off by being blunt, then I'll try and soothe the wound. Bang Bang is extremely overrated and overpriced for what it is. I have given it multiple tries. It just is not the best burger and you leave wondering the following: 1) why you just paid an arm and a leg while you're 2) still hungry 3) not satisfied 4) questioning what the hype is. 

I have had fries, a burger (prior to being vegan) and since being vegan have had the burger bowl with the black bean burger and no cheese. Portions are fairly small. The black bean burger is tasty enough but nothing unique.  The salad portion was small and toppings were not plentiful enough. But the lettuce was crisp and nothing was poor quality. 

As for the environment itself, the staff members have always been friendly and it is always clean inside. I especially love the girl who always chats with me about her being vegetarian and me vegan. She was very easy going and accommodating when I had to make my order a little more complicated. 

It is definitely not the worst place but I can see spending that amount on a meal elsewhere can benefit my hungry stomach and craving tastebuds more."}
{"text":"My favorite Charlotte fancy burger place by far. Bang Bang features grass fed beef from a family farm in Virginia and their buns are made daily from local Nova's bakery in NoDa. Their hangover burger is my favorite, with an egg and hash browns on a toasted bun with one or two patties. Don't underestimate their chicken club--it's just as delicious as the beef and veggie patties! Ask for their sweet and tangy bang bang sauce is perfect on everything, too!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Kind of an odd location, which threw me off a bit to begin with, but the food is amazing. I ate here the first time because I was given a gift card. I'm so glad that gave me a reason to eat here because I was seriously missing out by never stopping in. Go here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cowboy burger. Bacon was cooked right,  I  Swapped the cheese w/ ghost pepper cheese. (It had a nice kick) The bbq sauce was excellent.  (Dipped my fries in that)   burger was great.  Pink,  juicy,  great flavor,  nice chew on the bun. Not doughy at all.  

MY hand cut fries were spot on! Double fried,  crispy,  perfect.  

I'd  eat here again,  specially if it wasn't 55 minutes away! OPEN MORE LOCATIONS PLEASE! (MOORESVILLE, STATESVILLE, or  FRANCHISE ME...lol )"}
{"text":"I found out about Bang Bang a little over 2 years ago because of their spectacular sliders and big win at the Moo and Brew festival. 2 years ago I said to The Lady, \"We should check that place out!\"
It's taken me 2 freaking years to get over there. Why didn't anybody yell at me sooner?
We had a group of 6, and on a Saturday night at about 7ish we were able to push 3 2-seaters together without inconveniencing anybody. I don't know if this is always the case, the place is relatively small.
This was the type of menu that makes you look at one option say, \"That looks good\" and then another and say \"Oh, that looks good too!\" and another and just say \"Well $h!t.\"
So I asked the girl at the register, and she suggested the Gangnam Style burger, and I opted to stick with the fries as my side because Yelp told me to.

All burgers are served on a wooden board that has a hole cut out for the burger cup, a really simple but nice presentation. All 6 of our orders came out in about 7 minutes, which was perfect. 

Now, they have a warning on their menu, but the least they cook their burgers are medium. I'm a medium rare guy, always have been, but there's not really any arguing here. And frankly, you would never know the difference. These burgers are out of this world good. I especially loved the subtle spice in the Gangnam Style with the pork belly. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it. Their fries are also to die for; super crispy and well seasoned. 

Honestly, this is probably my new favorite burger place in Charlotte. Can't wait to go back and try more of their creations."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since before the Triple D visit.  I'm a big fan of this place.  Burgers are still really good, but the 2 stars is for cleanliness.  We came in on a Saturday just after opening.  Place should have been spotless.  Not the case.  Floor at our booth was sticky like it had not been cleaned, the glass doors and windows had greasy finger prints all over them, and ketchup splatters on the walls and lampshades.  These all look like they had been there a while.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, has that char grill taste to them, and it doesn't hurt that they use Pat Lafreda meat. And there fries and onion rings are also great!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! Haha literally. I had no idea what to expect from this place upon first look. It's like a chipotle in service model - you walk up and order from the counter. They give you a number and bring you your food. The choices all sounded great! I went with the cowboy burger - grilled onions, cheddar cheese and bacon on a super soft bun covered in a house made BBQ sauce. My lunching companion ordered the Seoul burger with kimchi and bulgogi sauce. They were both cooked perfectly and were the best burgers either of us had ever had. No joke. If I could open a franchise I would. Wow."}
{"text":"Hands-down best burger spot in the neighborhood! I follow a mostly Paleo diet, so most places I go I have to find something on the menu and make a dozen changes to it (burger no bun, no cheese, no sauce, extra veggies ...). So I love that this place has a burger bowl that is more than big enough to fill me up. It comes in a huge salad bowl which is great for mixing, and comes on a bed of spinach with cubed sweet potatoes, avocado, bacon, tomato, onion, hardboiled egg, and a grass-fed beef burger patty for about $13. It's a ton of food, and I usually can't finish it all so I ask for the lemon-olive oil dressing on the side and pack up about half of the salad in a to-go box. 

And the last time I was there, I had to wait a couple of extra minutes for my food to be brought out after my boyfriend's was brought out, so they gave us a small gift card to apologize for the inconvenience. So sweet!"}
{"text":"As recommended by our Uber driver this afternoon, definitely a local joint with really, really good burgers!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try bang bang burger for a while. They hangover burger was featured in a local Charlotte magazine and I knew I had to head over. Fried eggs are not my thing but the person who went with me it was... I ordered the TNT burger with fries. I thought it was ok, the burger is fresh but the patty is small compared to the huge bun it is on.. the flavor was ok, the onion rings were immediately soggy and not a good option with the jalapeno salsa. Person I was with ordered the double hangover burger and either they didn't double the patty or a double wasn't much larger than the single.. they really enjoyed it. I would eat there again, but there are other burger joints I would choose before this one."}
{"text":"That food was great! Would definitely go back again. The space is small, and the drink machine Dr. Pepper needed to be changed out in the machine. The plate display is tasty, and the establishment was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"I've been going here since open and love it. 

I've probably been over 30 times at this point and it is always good. Consistency and quality.

Owner is very friendly. He loves his craft and will educate you on good and quality of meat.

Get a single so you have space to try other sides."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place has everything I want!!  The service is super friendly and the food is high quality.  The menu offers burgers that will blow your mind and taste palate as well.  It is kept very clean in the dining area, but the bathroom could use a bit of TLC.  I absolutely LOVE their salads and try to have one at least once per week.  The lighting is what I would call \"mood lighting\" with booths that have TONS of space and tables to meet your dining needs.  

Recently, I called in an order for a salad and when I arrived a computer glitch didn't send the order to the kitchen so it wasn't ready.  Mike, the cashier, apologized and gave me a 5 dollar discount on the order as well as a free beverage.  I didn't ask for this nor did I expect it!  It was unexpected and rare in the fast food industry to have this type of awesome service.  

This is a business that works hard to keep your business!!  I would recommend Bang Bang Burgers to anyone wanting to try a place that offers quality product at reasonable prices with EXCELLENT service!! 

Let Mike know he is doing a great job!!  He defiantly earned my repeat business."}
{"text":"The burgers were tasty but not much beef on the bun and the tomatoes were bland.  The fries were absolutely not fresh cut and were quite difficult to chew."}
{"text":"Conflicting thoughts. Pro: tasty burgers. Good fries. Major non-food con: men's room was old and not particularly clean- water on floor, paper towels on floor, room itself overdue and in need of renovation. Men's room also used for restaurant storage- curtained off shelves (space tight in restaurant I believe). Not sure if the conditions I saw carry over to the condition and cleanliness of the kitchen area. Excellent food wins though."}
{"text":"I had the Gagnam Burger. It was good and everything was cooked just the way I like it. Unfortunately the broke the cardinal rule of to-go food. They set a greasy burger on top of a bun. When I got home of course I had a soggy, wet bun that was inedible. On top of that they didn't give me the maple dip I paid extra for."}
{"text":"\"Great place, great staff, and AMAZING food! 
By far, this is the best burger joint in Charlotte, and one of the best burgers you will ever eat!! 
(Try going mid-week, over the weekend the place is small so its gets super busy)\""}
{"text":"Ugh, another place that makes me wish we could offer half stars.  3.5 would be a little more accurate.

I didn't know this place would be set up like a Smashburger so I was a little surprised when I walked in.  I was picturing a Bad Daddy's or Cowbell for some reason.  Nonetheless, the decor was cafe style, they had a couple large screen TV's showing some type of sporting event, fountain sodas, etc.  

The menu was easy to read behind the counter and there were roughly 10 types of burgers to choose from.  My husband went with the basic \"bang bang burger\" and I opted for the \"guacamole burger.\"  I was given the head's up from my fellow yelper that they would allow you to do a lettuce wrap so that was my \"bun\" of choice.  I also upgraded (for $1) to the sweet potato fries.

The food came out pretty quickly so that was a good thing and there were plenty of fries on the side that made me happy!  My husband's first impression was that the sandwich was all bun, very little meat.  My burger wrapped in lettuce was almost like a strip of a burger instead as opposed to a big hearty piece of meat.  Do you know those dollar chicken wraps you can get at McDonald's?  This was very reminiscent of one of those...The burgers were lean alright...almost too lean!

However, they were good.  Of course I love the fact that they come from a farm that does not use hormones or other additives in their meat.  I think the quality was far better than any normal \"fast food\" place but I wasn't expecting to compare it to a Wendy's or McDonald's so that is really not the point...

The burgers were juicy and definitely had good flavor but I would get the double if you are even slightly hungry.  I think the double would still only equate to a quarter pounder so you can definitely handle it.  It appears that all the burgers are served with their coveted \"bang bang\" sauce, which I am pretty sure is 1000 island. It was still good.

The fries were hand cut which I thought were awesome.  Unfortunately, the sweet potato fries were pretty soggy.  The maple glaze they offered with the fries was scrumptious.


All in all, it was Ok.  The owner was very friendly and told us all about his adventure as a new restaurant owner.  It is certainly not easy to start a new business!  I wouldn't say this concept is brand new to the Charlotte area so he may have his work cut out for him...the location may or may not be to his disadvantage. 

He made it clear this was going to be all about the burgers.  He wants the burgers to speak for themselves.  They have a couple other options but he plans on removing salads from the menu.  This is a basic burger joint.  Burger. Fries. Soda. Beer.  Love it or leave it."}
{"text":"TNT burger #bangbangclt the burger was good the sweet pot fries were better but the maple dipping sauce was the bomb... We also tried the gangnam style burger which was really good and guac burger which was not so great .. :) all over good experience ~~ :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try a little something new on this trip, and we're so glad we did. They have lots of burgers, and you can get them made with a black bean patty or 100% grass-fed beef (with an upcharge). Grass-fed beef was my choice since that's what I use at home. I ordered the TNT Burger, and it was delicious. It was perfectly cooked. It was pretty spicy. It came with ghost pepper cheese, fried onion straws and sliced jalepenos. The siracha mayo came on the side, so you can control how much or little you want on your burger. The fries were great too...the perfect sidekick. I had the sweet potato fries and they came with a slightly sweet dipping sauce that I want every time I eat sweet potato fries. 

The service was friendly and the all employees seemed to get along well with each other too which is something I always try to take note of. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and my husband made note that he wants to return the next time we're in town to try the Seoul Burger because it looked and smelled so good when it went by."}
{"text":"First time eating g here in a while, and currently have a burger in front of me that was made with preformed frozen burger patties, if that's what I wanted I could of gotten fast food for less money a $14 burger should at the very least be hand pressed.  You have lost my business"}
{"text":"I was wondering why the fries were so hard and tough. Turns out they didn't even fully cook them. Never eat uncooked potatoes. I ended up with a severe stomach bloat and ache throughout the rest of the day that culminated in me having flu-like symptoms. Burgers were way too small and meager for the price. It didn't taste that special. I'd take Burger King against this on any given day. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for the three stars but I am a burger snob! With burgers, I prefer hand formed patties, they create a less dense burger and just taste better... These burger seem like they are recently defrosted and who knows where the meat is from... What gets the stars is the toppings, sauce, sides and service."}
{"text":"Burger Bowl didn't sound appealing to me before I tried it but is amazing. Every burger I've tried on the menu is delicious and I'm a big fan of the sweet potato fries. I've never been disappointed at bang bang."}
{"text":"Omg I love this burger spot in CLT almost as good as moo and brew ( they have a larger beverage selection) Bang Bang burgers it's a great spot for a bite to eat and usually less crowded on a Friday then some other  spots. While it's a hidden gem it's definitely yummy !"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for a little. We was suppose to go somewhere else but I convinced my husband for us to try a new place. We ordered our food and I tried one of Charlottes beer which had good flavor I think it was called blondie. took a table, a number, and our food came. I knew just from the look of the burger and the grease it would be good. My husband loved a sauce they had so much I gave him mines. Burgers was awesome and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good burger, great fries. Only complaint was that I was served a single onion with the burger. Very helpful at the counter, great service. Not sure I could ever give them five stars. I would recommend you try it once."}
{"text":"I have read so many great things about Bang Bang Burgers, so we finally came here for dinner on a recent Friday night. The place was pretty busy, but we were able to place our order and found a seat pretty easily. 
I had the Gangnam Style burger (single $10) with a side of sweet potato fries with a maple dip. The food was undoubtly tasty. I enjoyed my burger alot. The sweet potato fries were a little soft, but the dip was great.
While I am a fan - the price point of this place is a little hard to swallow. Definitely a splurge for a burger. I can have 2 burgers at 5 Guys with this price and 5 Guys burgers are great. 
I feel obligated to hit a -0.5 stars for pricing/value, making this a 3.5 stars review."}
{"text":"Good Burger Joint, it was good to try some different favors that are outside the stand fair.   I got the \"gangum\" style burger and it was just what I wanted that day. Pork Belly, burger, spicy mayo, vinaigrette, equaled tastiness.
I got a side of fries, expecting to be  average, they were really good. I couldn't stop eating them. Crusty, Salty and mushy hot potatoes inside,, ughhhh so good.

Everything is made fresh for you, Burgers, Fries, all came out hot and fresh.

Stop buy and grab a burger here if you are feeling the itch and pay no attention to their storage problems around the bathroom hallway. :)"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Burger was tasty!   French fries were hard in some parts!  Not cool!  I think it was because they were ridiculously crowded last night.   Overall Im definitely going back!  Blows five guys away!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. The first time I got the hangover burger. It was good & messy. This came with the Bang Bang sauce which, like others have stated is basically 1000 island dressing (I liked it better with just ketchup & mustard). The second time (last night) I tried the Cowboy burger. While I was waiting for my order they gave me a sample of some of their homemade BBQ chips which were quite tasty. I really enjoyed the Cowboy Burger, the BBQ sauce tasted homemade & had a little kick. The homemade fries here are also really good. The staff & owner are very friendly & welcoming. They are also very helpful with any questions about the menu. I live right across the street from this place so I think I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Great place for a burger!  Would definitely go often if lived closer, which after our meal my husband said he wished we lived near here so could go every week!"}
{"text":"This hamburger was so good I wanted to hump it. 
Onion Rings were crispy but not falling apart. 
I drank a cold beer and watched Full House reruns on their TV

Overall: A"}
{"text":"We went here for a good burger.  I have Celiac disease and need everything strictly gluten free, so finding a good burger can be challenging. 

Their food was great.  The gluten free bun (made by a local baker) was especially good, perhaps the best part. I got the (GF) cowboy burger with a side of the edamame salad.  The burger was well cooked and the bacon nice and crispy. The salad had a nice, bright, citrus flavor.  The burger patty is pretty small but the cheese was stretchy and good.  I felt there could have been a little more of everything, and left a bit hungry.  

If you're celiac, no fries for you, but that's not uncommon.  One server knew more than another about providing food for me, but she stepped in and helped out and all staff were very considerate and welcoming. 

My dinnermate got the normal fries with the bang bang burger and thought both were very good was well.  He got a double, which seems to have been a good idea.  There were only two beers on tap (and no other adult beverages to be seen) so that was limiting, but it was a family environment and there are plenty of places in the area to grab a drink. 

All in all, I'd definitely go back.  They were attentive and the food was good."}
{"text":"Really super burger and I loved that they have local beer on tap. I went with the special of the day, something to do with a fried smoked gouda and a tomato aoili on top with the regular fries and it was super tasty, held together nicely and was just a little bit drippy. The fries did not give me the impression that they were delivered by a food service truck. Random cuts and bits of tater were nice.

My only complaint is that they only offer medium and medium well. I like to be able to tasty the meat, so I'm a medium rare sort of guy. Stupid lawyers!"}
{"text":"Great place! Nice to have GF fresh buns available and loved the variety of sides! Argula and asparagus salad with red onions is wonderful. A welcome change from fries. The staff is very friendly and accommodating - making helpful suggestions without being pushy."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me knows about my unending love affair with egg-rolls so I definitely had to stop through and grab a order. Definitely tasty but there was literally grease dripping from the ends. I hate a greasy egg-roll!  The prefect egg-roll has adequate filling, crispy and free of grease so this definitely didn't make the mark. They were rather skinny as well. For 3.50 a piece I was expecting better. But I will definitely be back to try a bang bang burger and fries."}
{"text":"Good burgers that aren't so enormous you'll have to break your jaw just to take a bite (can you tell i take issue with those corporate places who serve huge burgers hoping the size will cover the fact that it's  tough and under seasoned?).
House made chips are pretty good. There are a number of toppings to customize your burger.
Quick service, easy to park, straight forward. It's one of my go-to burger joints.
Oh! And the burgers are served on delicious locally made brioche buns!"}
{"text":"Love every burger at this place! Great sweet potato fries, and good service. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Awesome burger. Had the Cowboy Burger cooked medium. Quick service and great local craft beers. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bang Bang Burgers. The part that attracted us most to this joint was the grass fed beef option on the menu and we were not disappointed.

Atmosphere: order at the front, sit down, and they bring your food to our table. It's an upscale fast food setup, like a Zoe's Kitchen or Panera. 

Burgers: I ordered the daily special, which was a burger (I upgraded to the grass fed beef), Mac and cheese and Sriracha dusted honey bacon on a bun. The burger by itself was mouth-watering and the bacon was a great mix of sweet and smokey. The Mac and cheese was a good consistency with hint of relish. I absolutely loved the burger and it was not too filling. My husband got the Seoul burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  

Sides: the broccoli and garlic was very good,however I was hoping for more. The only downside to our visit was the French fries, they were a little too greasy for my liking.

Overall, this place was a great find....will definitely stop by to try more delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. At first I was a little suspicious of the place, it didn't look like it was 4.5 restaurant, but after I had a burger, I was like: yep, that's it! I had TNT burger and it was good, but I wouldn't say it was something special. My spouse had a Pimento cheese burger and it was fire! Somehow he always orders more delicious food than I do;) fries were yummy as well. Staff was friendly and explained the menu to us. I would totally recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner, it's laid back, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"We went there because we saw them on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. First of all let me say the food was very good. The burgers were cooked well and had very good flavor. The buns were fantastic as were the fresh cut fries. I had regular fries and the wife had the sweet potato ones."}
{"text":"This was our first stop as soon as we arrived to Charlotte, and wow were we impressed with the burgers here. They are full of flavor, perfectly seasoned and delicious. You absolutely have to try the bangburger sauce on any burger you order, it is a must try. Also be sure to ask for a couple extra sauces to dip your fries in. Speaking of the fries, they were perfectly crisp and cooked perfectly. They were a great complement to an awesome burger. I don't think we could have found a better burger place in the city than this place. Definitely will be back here next time im in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A favorite. The burgers are good but the chicken sandwich is my go to. Best sweet potato fries in town! Onion rings are on point too."}
{"text":"I love that the speciality burger restaurant trend has survived in the Kale, Paleo and other healthy trend that have popped up in recent years. This was a great lunch! Walking in, the decor is cozy and inviting. Ordering at the counter, the staff was friendly and helpful suggesting a few of the most popular burgers. I ordered the Pimento Burger, I'm a sucker for anything having to do with Pimento, well cheese in general, but you catch my drift. Colin ordered in the safer side, deciding on the original 'bang, bang' Our friends orders the 'hangover' and 'Cowboy'. The burgers aren't cheap as far as burgers go. You're looking at 10ish bucks- so not bad especially for the quality of burger. 

Sweet potato fries, fresh local burger buns and maple ranch dipping sauce. YUM! This place was surprisingly good. I'll for sure be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely holds up to the hype it gets. The food was fantastic and I left stuffed and satisfied. The burger you order comes out as pretty as they advertise. The only downside to this place is that seating is difficult to find during their busy hours, and you kind of have to hover over people until someone leaves. Parking can be a little tough too during busy hours as well. The food is worth the wait though. If you're not in the mood to sit down take out is also an option. Service is solid here too."}
{"text":"Great burgers, awesome hand cut fries, Big Bang sauce was fabulous!  Love the boards the burger and fries were served on.  Only issue was the restaurant appeared dirty and the bathrooms were filthy."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Decided to try Bang Bang after seeing pics from Yelp. The burger options and ammenities were great. The bun as you can see is very soft and fresh bread. Single patty was big enough for me. The french fries were also excellent. They are freshly cut and remind me of Great Steak french fries and are similar but better than 5 Guys. I reccomend the kemchi burger or the pork belly and add bacon!"}
{"text":"Great menu, excellent burgers!  Love going on kids eat free night!  :-)  A must try if you want a fun and different burger than you would be able to get at a typical burger joint!"}
{"text":"Great burger, good beer, good sides... but the price is high for what you get. The wait wasn't bad though, and the staff was friendly. It's just expensive for a straight burger joint."}
{"text":"The food tasted good but it made me sick. I had a guacamole burger and onion rings which left an old oil taste in my mouth the rest of the day. I was nauseous hours later so I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Super busy place ! Great fries and a great variety for meat eaters. The black bean burger was okay. Definitely has better but the overall food was good!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite burger joint. Hands down the best in Charlotte. The ingredients are super fresh and the meat is fantastic compared to other local places. You can tell they go the extra mile for quality. The burgers aren't greasy or overly salty like most places. It's just plain good, well presented, and for a reasonable price.

I could go on about how great the food is, but I will keep coming back because the owners are so passionate about their craft and I want to see them succeed. Joe, the owner, sat with us for awhile and told us all about his adventure starting this place. Genuinely an awesome guy who listens to his customers and is always happy to share some of his secrets for a delicious burger if you ask. I'll definitely be back... regularly!"}
{"text":"This place is a beef lovers dream. The hubby and I stopped in today to try their Burger. Let me tell you that they did not disappoint. We both had the Mushroom & Swiss Burger, sweet potatoe fries, and ice tea. My burger was cooked to perfection(medium well) My husbands burger was well done, and he stated it was excellent. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.(They serve  La Frieda  Beef).The atmosphere was great?. I will most definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Heard some great word of mouth about this place but could never quite find it for the longest time. That's because its' hidden away in a tiny plaza on the corner of 7th and Pecan, between a subshop and a Caribbean restaurant, and I have lately been kicking myself because I've been driving past this tiny little burger joint for the longest time when I should have been eating there. Bang Bang Burgers has been pumping out some of the best burgers in the Charlotte area for a little over a year now - creating a menu of both solid favorites like bacon burgers and other more exotic concoctions, all featuring the freshest ingredients with little gourmet touches to make your tastebuds explode with flavor. If you like a regular old burger go to Five Guys. If you want something with just as much meat but with a ton more flavorful options with a reasonable price, go to Bang Bang. Two Bangs, because the Bang is not only in the buck (price) but also the flavor, as your tastebuds will savor, and thank you later, gator."}
{"text":"I was disappointed, having enjoyed much better burger spots in Atlanta. I paid up to make my burger a double and more healthy- both by making it grass fed and switching out fries for veggies- and it doubled the price.  The burger was fine, but totally overpriced.  I've had much better burgers at upscale steakhouses for less.  2 minutes before the official closing, and while I was still eating, they turned a vacuum on that was a mood killer."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hangover with a side of onion rings...THey were hot and crispy and the burger was hot and fresh and the egg was perfectly runny...The sauce was really really good... Everything was good~ Loved the bun too! Would definitely come back...Its hard to find a truly good burger and this met my needs on every level!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger I have ever tasted. Can't wait to visit Charlotte again. Or they should just build one in vegas."}
{"text":"Wowie Wow Wow Wow! This was my second trip to Bang Bang, and i had my burger cravings satisfied to the max. I ate here the first time, perhaps 2 years ago. I always knew I would return, but kept putting it off. 

This trip I decided to try something else other than the onion, bacon and cheese deal. So I went with the TNT burger with all the spicy accouterments like ghost pepper cheese, jalapeños, and Sriracha mayo (on the side). It was hot, but not uncomfortably so. I dumped a little too much mayo halfway through, which had me reaching for my drink more often- but the taste was still delicious. It's certainly not make your nose run hot, if you are a person who likes some heat, you'll be able to handle it.

My little one pegged this place as her favorite burger spot in town the first time we went. I liked it, but I wasn't so ready to give it that designation. But now? Oh yeah- it's up there. Who knew a youngster would have better sense to choose before I would! Lol!"}
