{"text":"We went for the buffet dinner time. Food was way below average. Service was poor. Ambience bad too. Chicken was not even fully cooked. Halal food though..so that was the only reason we tried it out."}
{"text":"Just responding to the owner's reply and informing community of the cheating practices at some Pakistani-Indian outlets.  1- I stopped going to this place because of its pathetic food and service, decided to check it out again to see if there has been any improvement.  2- I still stand by my comment that there was no goat in goat curry, it was lamb as it smelled lamb and tasted lamb. Most of the Caucasian-Canadians don't know the difference but Asian-Canadians do, so don't try to cheat people. Also, Al Muneer restaurant buy meat from Basha foods, they sell lamb not goat!!!!!  3- The hot curry was packed in those cheap Styrofoam boxes by the restaurant and was spoiled by the cheap material. Not by warming them at home in microwave safe glass containers.   4-What about selling tandoori roti for the price of naan? Again, Caucasian-Canadians don't know the difference but we do. So stop cheating people. Want to see, buy and taste real fresh naans, please go to Chatkhara restaurant where they will make it in front of your eyes.  5- I stand by my comment on Biryani, it was from Khan catering. Al Muneer buys it cheap from them and sell for $9.99, Khan sells the same for $8.00"}
{"text":"Dinner took 90 minutes to arrive. Food was disgusting (except the butter chicken). Even the rice had a weird chemical smell/taste. There was huge black hair in the byrini chicken and plastic in the spinach curry. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef nihari and chicken biryani . Food tasted sour at first when I was eating it , I stopped after one serving ; a few hours later I got the worst stomach ache and had to spend the rest of my evening in the washroom. Terrible stale old food made me so sick, I don't know if this is a one off situation as I've never ate here before but damn I'm still feeling sick as I'm writing this review. Will never visit this restaurant again"}
{"text":"I'm not one to go from business to business giving bad reviews, but this place really left me no choice.  One of the worst places I've been to for an Indian restaurant. Called ahead of time to confirm if they had halwa and puri, was told no when we got there after being told yes on the phone. Decided to grab food from the buffet and a few parathas on the side. They ended up being puri's instead! The owner claimed them to be \"puri parathas\", talk about lying to your face. I may be a coconut, but I know the difference between a puri and a paratha.  We had to ask to have our table cleaned, and weren't even given a menu because all they had to serve was their lunch buffet. We were charged for a weekend buffet even though it was a weekday (it was Christmas eve, but nonetheless a weekday). The food was around 3-star, but my negative rating in customer service balances it out to a 1 overall.  I don't expect much in terms of customer service from Indian restaurants, but this was well below sub-par. Save your dollars for another restaurant, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"No bullsh*t...Decent food with good prices. Courteous host. Ordered some vegetarian lunch on a weekday for takeout. A lot of Indian/Pakistani restaurants don't pack their food well when doing a take out order. No issues here though. There was no leaking from the package. Quantity was good for the price."}
