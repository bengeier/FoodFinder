{"text":"Found Trios Bistro while searching for a place near Yonge and Dundas for a business lunch and found the atmosphere to be comfortable and much quieter than other establishments in the area. Ordered the noodles on the menu and was satisfied with the food and service was adequate. The most prominent feature of this establishment is the atmosphere; perfect for a casual business lunch."}
{"text":"Was here for a business trip and pleasantly surprised with how good the food and service was here. I was here multiple times and each meal was good. The staff here is super friendly. Will miss having this place as my go to."}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant located inside the Marriott Eaton Centre (Downtown) so extremely convenient if staying there and worth a trip even if not.
Food is excellent and high quality with a very nice variety especially Gluten Free pasta, scallops, salads, etc.
Nice selection of ~8 draft beers as well as full drink menu.
Service was friendly and very good.
Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"After a day of walking around the city we decided to stop here for a drink before heading up to our room. The service was very good, and mojitos were on point. Also tried the mango creme brulee, with mango pieces mixed with the custard, and it was surprisingly delicious, didn't expect that for a hotel restaurant. Def a nice cap to a long day."}
{"text":"I love love this restaurant!
1. Service - excellent staff with first class service :)
2. Ambience - the restaurant has a high glass ceiling that has lots of sunlights with white wall. Just beautiful!
3. Food is pretty good too. 

This is my 2nd time trying this restaurant. First time - brunch, this time - winterliciois lunch. I had red snapper rice ball, well cooked with a great Japanese and western fusion ingredients and sauce. 

I have tried many high end restaurants in downtown Toronto but this one is exceptional as a whole experience. If you want a special time, this place will offer you one of the best dining experiences in Toronto. 

Only thing I would change is to keep the hot water hotter for the tea which is a minor change. I could be too picky."}
{"text":"Very solid kitchen.  Quality has been consistently good over the years and service quite attentive.  

Soups have been tasty that I've had.  Butter chicken as well - standard but well executed.  Meatloaf is very tasty.  Roasted veg that accompanies always nicely flavoured.  

Prices are actually reasonable for a hotel restaurant which is nice."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed like a kid who wanted soft serve on a hot summer day but have it melt when it was finally my turn ):

This was my first Winterlicious of the year and I was let down by the main.  The app and dessert were decent.  The sweet potato/bacon soup was rich and thick, I quite loved the contrast of sweet/salty in the ingredients and the texture was right on.

For the main, I got the beef bourguignon.  The high hopes I had for this dish came crashing down.. someone most definitely dumped salt into the stew and I had to keep eating the mash at the bottom to counteract the saltiness of the meat and sauce - which, for some reason, also had a bitter taste at one point.  The only thing I really remember about this dish is how thirsty I was afterwards.  Perhaps I should've just gone with a simple Focaccia sandwich.  

The dessert was lovely.  Triple cream brie was done just right with spiced pecans that I loved and figs with crunchy crostini.  I had a bite of the brownie and it was a bit too haevy for my taste, same with the butter pudding.  I'm glad I at least got to end my Winterlicious experience nicely, but I probably won't be back here until the chefs learn to cut the salt."}
{"text":"Inside a Marriott Hotel near Yonge and Dundas, this is a small place with a modern atmosphere. 

I was pleasantly surprised at their Winterlicious lunch. They offered us their regular menu as well to look at. I liked that they did that so I could learn more about the restaurant and decide if I wanted something from their regular menu.

Clam chowder was one of the best I've ever had. They were so generous with clams. Gnocchi was pretty good, too. I liked the squash puree. The poached peach dessert was very fresh and not too sweet. This place is definitely worth trying if you're staying at the hotel or happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious lunch with a large group of friends, and was pretty underwhelmed with my experience here. While the restaurant does look pretty nice (high windowed ceilings, lots of natural light, etc.), the food and service are both just kind of mediocre.

Appetizer: Goat Cheese Flat Bread (sundried tomato pesto, arugula, fresh basil, fire roasted red peppers). I ordered this because I love goat cheese and arugula, and it tasted just fine. The flat bread was a bit harder than I expected though, like I kind of forgot it was flat bread and felt like I was eating a cracker at times.

Main: Beef Bourguignon. This sounds really fancy, but really it's just like beef stew. I don't know if in reality it is actually supposed to be fancy, but the one at Trios was kind of a let down. I mean, you would expect there to be some variation in flavour, but ultimately the stew just tasted... salty. Like super salty. Apparently there were pearl onions, crimini mushrooms and double smoked bacon in the stew, but really, I have no recollection of any of that stuff. Really it was all just beef, salt, and mashed potatoes in my memories.

Dessert: Triple Cream Brie with fig preserve, spiced pecans and crostini. I actually really enjoyed this. The brie was not too strong in flavour and really was very creamy. It was delicious on its own as well as with the sweet fig preserve. This was definitely my favourite part of the meal.

Service: It seemed like the servers were trying... and they were all really nice, but I was confused. Considering the restaurant really was NOT busy, they were surprisingly absent for a lot of the time. Besides coming out to take our orders and bring us our food, for the most part they were nowhere to be seen. I remember this especially being a problem after we had all had our beef stews, and one of my friends specifically had to request to have our waters refilled because they were all low and we were all dying of thirst. Sooo can't say I was terribly impressed with this either.

Overall: Definitely a little disappointed - maybe a little bit less so if the lunch had been in the cheapest category ($18) but I don't think it was worth the $23 price tag we paid."}
{"text":"DÃ©cor is quite modern. Seating options include stools at the bar, tables, and high-backed curved booths.The resto is just off the hotel lobby, so it can be a bit loud.

Both food and drink are a pricey for what you get, but that's the (regrettable) standard in hotel dining. The breakfast buffet is fine but overpriced at $29. The lemon pepper calamari appetizer ($11) had more finesse that would be anticipated. Cod and chips ($19) were tasty but the portion was small. Nothing objectionable about the grilled shrimp salad ($13).

Good service. No problems with my allergies which means that the servers conveyed them to the kitchen."}
