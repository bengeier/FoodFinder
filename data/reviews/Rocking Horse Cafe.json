{"text":"The Rocking Horse Cafe is a small little place attached to the local gas station.  The building looks like a retro gas station from the 1950's (it probably is!).  The food is basic; soup, sandwiches, burgers, BLT's, fries and they also do breakfast.  It is fresh and tasty and the service is wonderful.  Instead of eating at \"The Mall\" stop here for a bit of peace and quiet and service with a smile."}
{"text":"We go there all the time for breakfast and Always a have a great experience. I am on a first name basis with the crew and really enjoy the personal service and home cooked food!  A must visit for road weary travelers or Calgaryites looking for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"One of the best little diners anywhere!  The menu isn't huge, and they aren't open long hours, but the Rockin Horse always serves up really great food. The owner makes the soups fresh daily, and there's always some sort of dessert option. I highly recommend stopping in if you're driving through or looking for a place a bit different."}
{"text":"We didn't care for this place. Serve yourself coffee but we took the last two cups out of one of two pots and had to tell the owner both pots were empty. She made one new pot and it was the slowest coffee maker ever! Only Texas toast and only strawberry or peanut butter to spread. Eggs were cooked right. Only cubed potatoes. Didn't like the sausage."}
{"text":"By far the best place for breakfast.  Food is always cooked right. Service is always friendly and the employees of the  family owned resturant always try to remember everyone by name...even if you only come once in a while  great bang for your buck too. Once you come here it will always be your favorite spot to come to, unlike other big franchises where your just treated like cattle and just another number."}
{"text":"The service. The food. The desert. The service!!! What more can I say, this is an awesome little diner (think Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives). The homemade soups (she makes 52) are AMAZING. The club sandwich was better than you'd expect and if you are a new customer you get a free sample of the bread pudding that is a 10/10. The food is seriously awesome but the service is what really makes this place. this is a new destination for me and my family. They only do breakfast and lunch and are open 7am to 3pm and have all day breakfast on Saturdays (closed Sundays). Definitely give this little gem a try."}
