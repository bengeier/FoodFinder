{"text":"Decent bulk foods store. On the first level of the Faubourg.  They have lots of candies and chocolates, some dried fruits, lots of nuts and spices. They also have a lot of (pre-packaged) teas.   The real downside, is they only have one weigh scale in the entire store - at the checkout. Kinda lame and feels a bit like a money grab. Besides that, decent clean place."}
{"text":"Scoops has moved to the corner of Fort on Ste. Catherines street.  The new place is bright and welcoming (much better than the Faubourg).  However, the prices are very expensive and I won't be going back for that very reason.  A medium sized bag of almonds cost me $8 - the same size bag of almonds at Walmart costs $4.  Even the Bulk Barn has lower prices.   Nice store with a cafe on-site, but too rich to justify."}
{"text":"Such a curiously awesome shop with candy, plants, toys, and a very friendly staff. If you like succulents and jelly beans, you'll love this shop."}
