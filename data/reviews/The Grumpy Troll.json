{"text":"Beer is good. Food seemed appropriate. Service was a bit scatterbrained. Everyone was very nice. If you're in the area stop in. Otherwise seek out a brewpub near you for similar fare."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I and another couple were in town to ride the bike trail and decided to go here for dinner Friday night (7/27).  Of course on Friday night the place was packed so we waited with a couple of their brews which were good.  When we were seated we had a huge pretzal that was served with three different mustards and a bowl of melted cheese.  It was delicious and a great way to start the meal.   For dinner, we all ordered the fish fry(what else do you do on a Friday night in a Wisconsin bar?).  The cod fish fry was very good and the sweet potato tater tots were terrific.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Saw the signs on the highway and decided to stop and glad we did. We ordered the pretzel for an appetizer and it was good and there was plenty of mustard and cheese. Can't wait to go back and try a burger or entr√©e because all the food looked good."}
{"text":"THE WORST- adult, male, strawberry blonde host ever. Zero eye contact and he was incapable of greeting us because he was busy being confused by the hard copy table seating document. Shaking his head while gripping a white-out strip tape trying to 'fix' things. Lots of young people walking about, dirty empty tables everywhere and not a busser in sight. We asked for a bar table and got it but it came with some eye rolls (there were two empty bar tables - one sat dirty for +15 min). We ordered right away. I ordered the grumpy troll burger, no cheese. Super plain. Bacon may have been cooked yesterday (I had to pull a weird chunk of it outta my mouth). Flagged down our person asked for mustard and raw onions. Asked again. Then it finally came and the onion included the onion core, because everyone loves that part. When she came to clear plates she said nor asked nothing about the mess of burger left on my plate (see below).   Overall service and food was well worth the one star. Hey host-dude your stress does not belong at the front of the house. People don't forget when you too busy to give a $&/t.  D- customer service. 10/14/17 - 2pm."}
{"text":"Went on a recent Saturday evening, decided to just go upstairs and do the pizza. We had our 2 year old with us ... So good idea to be more kid friendly... Which you would think it is as upon entering there is a bunch of kid arcade games.  So the four adults ordered 2 pizzas and I asked just for kids Mac and cheese for my daughter. I was told there is no kids menu upstairs ... I would have to go downstairs and place a to go order for Mac and cheese for kids, pay separately and take a buzzer back upstairs, and then proceed back downstairs and pick it up when ready. REALLY????!! This is the same restaurant - same owner ?? And why wouldn't the staff offer to do this for you????  So--- I proceeded to do as I was instructed -- which the staff downstairs seemed perturbed I even came down to ask for this... Saying don't they have Mac and cheese up there??  Yes they do, with pesto and bacon apparently all pre mixed because they wouldn't make a kid friendly version!! Honestly how hard is it to boil some noodles and put on some milk and cheese and butter?  So I paid my $4.99 and got my buzzer. About 15 minutes later went and got my to go container of Kraft Mac and cheese that you make in the microwave at home with my 2tbs of applesauce.  My daughter didn't care she was hungry.... It was me. So we wait and wait and wait for our pizzas ... One came out an hour and 15 minutes later ... While good, really an hour and 15? As most can imagine... Over an hour with a 2year old is hard.... Thy aren't programmed to sit that long.  Our other pizza we were told wasn't ready yet ... So we had to get a box to go. The unenthusiastic waitstaff proceeded to say sorry, I should have mentioned that the kitchen was almost 2 hrs behind. Really??  The whole place was unorganized and and not friendly at all. We won't me returning anytime soon. .... Too bad, the pizza was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Sat at bar and had beer without knowledge they don't serve food at bar---good to know after very bad brew; bar maid was rude and impatient. Put our name in for table and waited a bit; hostess or waitress seated us by tossing wrapped silverware on table for midgets, both sides of table had seats pushed in with \"patrons\" jackets on one side and on the other, a guy sitting back with legs crossed with no thoughts of moving. \"You sitting?\" the waitress asked. Progosis negative. Went back to bar (filled), paid tab, drank quick and left. What a disapointment. Not the only place in town; only place we found rude and living a bit above stature. Burgers and beer is not a delicacy in WI, Grumpy."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Grumpy Troll several times with a group of 4, and each time was very enjoyable. Can get very busy/crowded. We make it a practice to get there early, whether for a Saturday lunch or any day for dinner. The award winning beers are excellent.  Wine is by the glass and rather expensive ($6 for red), particularly for non-vintage and the serving size. We have had very good sandwiches. The salads, which we each had this past visit, were outstanding! Service has been excellent. Will we return? Yes!"}
{"text":"We live about 30 miles from Mt. Horeb, but have been there often for our kids' sporting events.  Wish we had discovered this little gem years ago. Our experience there last night was a pleasure from start to finish. The restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, and we were glad to snag the last outdoor table available. Our waitress was prompt and very knowledgeable about the beers as she helped us make our selections.  (We ended up with the Trollfest and the Sunflower - both lagers, and very good.) The food was all excellent - chicken enchilada soup was delicious, the burgers were huge and cooked to perfection, the beer battered fries were awesome and the chicken Gorgonzola salad was filling and tasty. The hostess was extremely friendly and checked in with us several times throughout the meal to ensure all was well.  We will definitely make it a point to return to the Grumpy Troll whenever we have a chance!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because it was lunchtime and the family was HUNGRY! We were not disappointed!  We started out with the uf dah pretzel which was huge and freshly baked. They provided two different mustards for dipping but they both really tasted the same to me but the nacho cheese sauce was very tasty. The wife had a reuben sandwich which she said was very good. I had the brat burger which was okay but nothing to brag about. My side of coleslaw was very good though. Our sons both had the chicken enchilada soup which was excellent. The wife and I split the beer sampler and I found the brews to be quite good and varied. Only found one I didn't care for and the wife found four out of the twelve. The atmosphere was nice and the staff was attentive and very friendly even though the place was packed. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Nice stop for lunch on the way back from Madison to Iowa. Good service, nice and clean atmosphere and tasty food."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always stop in on the way back from climbing at Governor Dodge. I can only comment on the pizza and beer, as that is all we ever get. The Thai pie changed my life--they put fresh chopped cilantro and shredded carrots on the pizza after its done: so good! I have implemented that technique into my home pizza creations. They have a large selection of delicious beer to go with the pizza as well; I recommend the Maggie IPA. Staff have always been friendly and served us well.  I was with the person who reviewed \"Party Foul\" a couple of reviews down. It was not that bad. Sure they did mess a some things up, which is never good, but I thought the manager handled it well and was nice. The food and beer that I had were excellent. I got to eat a lot of free pizza out of the ordeal, which was good since I was hungry, and we did receive a satisfactory discount. I will be back. It is great there."}
{"text":"I cannot be grumpy about this place...it is incredible! The food is simply delicious! My husband tried one of their home brews...so impressed that he had to have another and we ordered their deep fried green beans as an appetizer--yummy! I ate beer cheese soup and a grilled turkey and cheddar sandwich and my husband had a brat sandwich with sweet potato tots---all yummy! The service was good and the place had a great atmosphere (although a tiny bit crowded in the lower level)! We really like this place--it sure offers quality at a reasonable price!!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and sloppy.  Took FOREVER to get our food, about 45 minute wait.  Waitress never came back to refill drinks or offer appetizers or take away a salad plate that was served  long before everyone else's order. .  When we stood up to flag one of the waitresses chatting behind the counter over to our table we  asked how much longer she didn't know. She started to leave and then we asked for refills.  Zero customer service.  Pizza was ok; nothing spectacular.  Italian beef was flavorless like it had been cooked in water.  Tender but no flavor. *Home made* chips were meh.  I think they are resting on old reviews or something.  A popular hang out but I don;'t think we would go back.  Other places near by to try."}
{"text":"Many of the food choices are exceptional. We love the walnut burger and macaroni bites! This review would be five stars based on location and food, however, their system for seating diners in the main dining room/pub is ridiculous. When you arrive there are several signs asking you to go through the pub and check in with the hostess-no problem there. What annoys me EVERY TIME we go is we are asked to wait 5-25 minutes while we stare at open tables and booths in the pub which have a \"reserved\" sign placed on each one. These are meant to be reserved for people waiting but either the hostess can't keep up or could there be a backup in the kitchen they are worried about? Either way--SEAT YOUR GUESTS IF YOU HAVE SPACE! They may even spend more on drinks and appetizers if you do! We will return when this operational annoyance is fixed. I'll carry out until they do."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed stopping in at the Troll for a great meal when we're in Mt. Horeb. Haven't been disappointed yet. The wife tells me the beer selection is great,  since I don't partake in the fermented and distilled beverages. Stop in next time you're in Mt. Horeb, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Must go place if you are in the area. Very close to the Cave of the Mounds. Good own-brewed beer. Very good food and service. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I don't mind this place.  Service is generally okay.  The Reuben is decent.  Fries are good.  Don't bother getting the nachos (meh), fish fry (blech), or beer cheese soup (icky)."}
{"text":"Biked about 25 miles and was ready for something cold and something to eat -- behold, a brewery just off the trail! The Grumpy Troll was packed, but we (2 of us) were seated in just a few minutes. Moments later we had a beer sampler and some fried green beans before us. All of the beers at the Grumpy Troll were good; it's rare to find a brewery with such consistency! We had pan-fried walleye for dinner -- maybe I was just starving, but it disappeared in mere seconds. The decor wasn't anything to write home about, but everything else was grand. Great place to stop if you're on the bike trail!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the grumpy troll on a quiet saturday afternoon in March. It was around 2-3 pm and the place was pretty vacant. We were the only three at the bar, but 3 pm is a weird hour for visiting a brewpub. Our crew ordered a salad, reuben, and some soup. All were good. The beer sampler was the highlight. Quality brews made in small batches. Some were great, others were mehhhhh, but overall, a solid offering from a small town brewpub. The troll has a nice, homey feel to it and doesn't seem manufactured or fake. It has a solid amount of personality and the atmosphere is certainly inviting for families. Good service, good food, good beer. Notice there were no \"greats\" in that statement, but that word is rare from this picky patron. ;)  Edit: Returned last week for a beer. I liked the beer a lot more than i did a few months ago. Didnt eat but the vibe was great and had some good conversation. Good music playing on the speakers too."}
{"text":"The Grumpy Troll is my favorite go-to for lunch whenever I'm in the area. The Grumpy chips are a must and the salmon salad is awesome! The staff are courteous, efficient and attentive. We often have people come in from out of town for our business and they always ask to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Grumpy Troll quite often and was very disappointed with both the food and service. The quality has diminished significantly. Slimy sweet potato tots and boring burgers. Both used to be superb 2 years ago! Bummer.....we really loved the old Grumpy."}
{"text":"We visited the Grumpy Troll based on Yelp reviews; we weren't disappointed.  The food was good (not the best I've ever had, but good), the waitress was very friendly and competent, and the beer was surprisingly good.  It was a bit of a wait on a Saturday night, but we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar in the meantime. Prices weren't the cheapest, but the beer was worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when passing through. Had to wait 10 mins to be seated but there was a street fair so not surprising. It was well worth the wait. We had a couple of their homemade brews (fantastic!) and their burgers were great. Hubs had the Reuben, and said it was \"excellent!\" I highly recommend stopping here, or if you're local, you should make this a regular hangout!"}
{"text":"Food was very poor and same witht eh serivce, no one really seemed to know what they where doing and where not respectful at all."}
{"text":"The Grumpy Troll has great burgers! Our kids all had plenty to eat from the kids' menu. We enjoyed the unique options (chips, dipping sauce, fries). The staff is very helpful and seemed to be happy. My only criticism would be that the hostess station is in an awkward place do the congestion in that area can be bad. I very much dislike waiting for a table two feet from where people are eating. We'll be back, but not when it's busy."}
{"text":"This place is great. Packed at 4 pm which is a good sign. Wait staff is friendly and do a great job. Burger was really tasty and walleye was delicious. Now for the pineapple upside down dessert. Give this place a try on your next visit to Mt Horeb"}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, friendly place.  They have some of the best micro-brews, which is the primary reason we make the trip (about 30 minutes outside Madison).  You can't go wrong with the Spetsnaz if you enjoy a great-tasting stout!    We've never had an issue with the $$$ like some others have had, but then again, we're usually there to drink, not eat (other than the cheese curds :)"}
{"text":"Food fit for trolls  You might as well climb into the back of a Sysco feed truck in your neighborhood and dig into any cardboard box, because it would be cheaper, and otherwise exactly the same as eating at the Grumpy Troll.  This place was hugely disappointing."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I tried the pizza and it was pretty decent.  Nothing great but the beers were fantastic.  I got the 12 beer sampler.  Erik the Red, Belsconcin and the Anniversary Ale really stood out.   Will return if I am in the area again"}
{"text":"Saturday evenings are frequently busy, typical 45-60 min waiting w/ no reservations. The burgers (Grumpy, walnut) are good, yet I usually get the chicken enchilada soup and pan-fried walleye sandwich. The Reuben is way too salty and meager for my tastes."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine pub food, with a decent beer selection.  Pleasant but rather frazzled waitress, who did not come round often enough, and the place was VERY crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while passing through the area and now I've got to find an excuse to come back. This was, easily, the best burger I've ever had. Who knew? I went with the Happy Troll Burger, but substituted for the vegetarian patty. It was simple, but delicious - cheese, lettuce, and spicy sauce. My husband was pretty content with his Grumpy Troll Burger, though we both agree the beer battered fries are better than the waffle fries. Portion sizes were perfect, and the prices were quite reasonable. Great service, too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been to the Troll at least three times and have always had a great experience.  The kids loved the pizza joint upstairs, my wife and I have had enjoyable dinners in the bar area.  Food is reasonable, always tasty.  I wanted very badly to try their Jalapeno beer, but it was gone when we came by the first time.  Not a huge fan of Erik the Red, Maggie is a close friend of mine.  Looking forward to what is on tap next time we visit."}
{"text":"Food quality has improved.  Wish the kid's menu had a bit more than the usual kids pub menu of burger, corn dog, chicken fingers.... bleah!   The giant pretzel is quite good, and the beers are top-notch."}
{"text":"Awww.....what a drag that was. We were so hungry and excited to have a beer and some lunch after a ride on the bike trails. The menu reads really well- lots of great-sounding choices and reasonable prices. I've got a tendency to order the special at local places-it's usually a great experience. Not so much here- today's special was a ground beef/black bean burrito that I thought was horrid. Ground beef and black beans have the same gritty texture, so the burrito was a huge mound of grit to me. The whole wheat tortilla would have been a bonus, but it didn't add anything to either the flavor or texture. Blech. The chicken enchilada soup was good, but really thick.   Service was super spotty as well- we asked for waters with lemon as we decided on a beer. Water came, no lemon. Ok. Ordered weiss beers, requested lemons. Beers came, no lemons. The bartender was happy to oblige, but still. We were told the special came with a choice of side, but that adding soup would be $2.00 more. Nope, on the bill the soup was $3.25 without a word from our server. The kicker was leaving the bills sitting there with cash in them, hoping we would get tired of waiting for our change and leave a HUGE tip. I hate it when people play these kinds of games....not going back."}
{"text":"Have been there many times -the fish is dry and over priced like fish sticks-2 small pieces -they stopped serving a roll-tried back again to give them a chance and it was worse-the beer is good-needs a lot of work on the food"}
{"text":"Nothing grumpy about it.  Burgers, fish fry and fine Wisconsin beer fill the place with fine Wisconsin cheer."}
{"text":"I probably go to the Grumpy Troll about 4 times a year.  Last Friday afternoon a friend and I were in town and decided to stop in for beer and a pizza. The upstairs pizzeria doesn't open until 4 o'clock and we were early, so I amused myself with a beer tasting. I tried the Trollfest Lager, the Trickster Dunkel Weizen, the Sunflower Farmhouse Ale and the Keller Brau (which is an unfiltered lager).  At 4 bells we went upstairs to the pizzeria and ordered a large Grumpy Troll pizza, which had Andouille sausage, Italian sausage, fresh tomatoes, onions, and sliced black olives on a thin crust. The pizza was really good and I accompanied it with my traditional choice when at the Grumpy Troll, which is a big glass of the Spetsnaz Stout.  Very pleasant place to have pizza and a beer on a sunny October afternoon."}
{"text":"The Grumpy Troll is an awesome little brewpub in Mt. Horeb that is definitely worth the drive from Milwaukee or Madison. Going on a day trip to Madison? Make this place your pit stop!  Their beers are especially tasty and absolutely turn the Grumpy Troll into a necessary destination for anyone who enjoys sampling craft beers (my boyfriend, a self-proclaimed beer snob, always brings home a few bottles whenever we visit). The burgers, soups, and sandwiches are excellent (the reuben is particularly good and rivals anything you can find in Milwaukee), and their beer-battered fries are some of the BEST I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Oregon beer snob here... This place makes the best beer in Southern Wisconsin.  How do I know?  Because I've toured them all.  New Glarus Brewing and Grumpy Troll are men amongst boys in this region. We had the Troll's beer sampler with 12 beers and what a great variety.  Also the fried green beans were good. The bartender's service and knowledge were outstanding.  You guys have a jewel right there in Mt. Horeb."}
{"text":"Very good brew pub beer. Good burgers. Bun nicely toasted, meat about the right proportions. Okay soup. Pretty good fish sandwich. Passible service. French fries had the goopy seasoning coating that is always a disappointment and leaves you wondering just what were they thinking when they signed onto that disaster. Disturbing green wall paint. Industrial look of the brewing room reflected in the visible ductwork in the eating chamber. Really about 3.5 stars, would probably improve if they got rid of the TVs and used a less unsettling wall color and served actual unadulterated french fries."}
{"text":"Excellent food and love the trolls.  Had a burger and liked there house made spicy mustard."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with decent pub style food. Nice selection of craft brews. If you are going on a busy weekend, be prepared for 30-45 minute wait and a loud environment."}
{"text":"Every time we tell someone that we are going to Mt. Horeb, he or she will inevitably say \"Oh! Are you going to the Grumpy Troll?\" Or something to that effect. This time, we finally went.   Husb. tried one of their red ales, I sampled their Boreas, and we split the nachos. We both enjoyed our beers, but the nachos were typical subpar bar nachos. They used a three-cheese blend, one of them being liquid nacho cheese, and within ten minutes our stomachs were turning! People around us ordered the sweet potato tots, and in hindsight we wished we would have tried them."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Mount Horeb, I always want to go to Grumpy Troll! They have amazing rebuens, and before I went GF, I loved the homemade beers. They also have a wonderful pizzeria upstairs."}
{"text":"I originally fell in love with this place while on a road-trip to the western part of the state. They made a lot of fantastic beers and the best spinach dip I've ever had.   As I've went back over the years, I started to like the beer less. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but I think either my palate expanded or the quality went down (I heard the original brewmaster left?). It also didn't help that I don't like bitter beers (i.e. IPA's) and those seemed to dominate the beer list year after year.  The food has consistently remained excellent. Each time I go I try something different and never leave unsatisfied. I didn't even realize they made potatoes au gratin until this last trip; I wanted to cry with joy when eating them, they were so cheesy and good. Also, the walnut burger was fantastic, as was the Belgian beer I had--the best beer I've tried of theirs in recent years.  Great service--the staff makes you feel right at home, and will give you samples of beer to try if you're undecided on what to select.  Whenever I'm in the area, I make it a point to stop here. You should too!"}
{"text":"We recently came here after visiting New Glarus Brewery. Food and customer service is splendid. Small batch brewery that hits the spot. Cheese curds and burgers are tasty. Special tip...try the fried snickers with ice cream. They got bombers to go or you can fill growlers. Love their Grumpy Troll shirts.  Love that they offer board games for family in a little hallway room in case there is a wait. We like to work off the food by walking around the town and taking pictures with the trolls around town. After all you are in Troll city! They also have a small cavern site near the town you can visit and check out some stalagmites."}
{"text":"Great place. We stopped by on a whim and glad we did. Food and was excellent.  The server was polite and engaging. Nice girl. And the manager or hostess was fantastic! Talk about on her game! Glad we tried it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. The bartender was more interested in washing dishes than serving customers. After waiting for over 10 minutes at the half empty bar, a bartender finally took our drink order- kind of. I got half the drinks I ordered and the bartender took off. My friend was ignored completely so we decided we should take off too. Had a much more professional experience at Wisconsin Brewery in Verona."}
{"text":"In my most recent visit, I order the Ensalata Fiesta, which I would recommend to anyone trying to avoid the taste of average, fried bar food. This was much better than past sandwiches I've ordered. I do miss the artichoke or asparagus flatbread. Huge portions. Had a pretty good bloody mary but wasn't served the more extravagant one advertised...oh well probably saved some money and it still came with a chaser of any quality (yes!).  Sat at the bar to avoid a wait during a busy Sunday. It was pleasant, plenty spacious with quick attention by the bartender."}
{"text":"Review created for a mild to hot summer day.  Beer: took me a while to acclimate, but when I did... I can drink 2-3 beers. Good variety: wheat, ambers, lagers (blonde, red, brown, Scottish), and now a bunch of IPAs. Their Sunflower and Trailside Wheat are tasty on a hot day. The rest are hit-or-miss.  Food: get SWEET POTATO TOTS and FRIED GREEN BEANS! OMG! these are fabulous.  Their main entrees are just decent (reuben with turkey). But these bea-u-tees are great! I've driven the 25 min just to get these to bring them back home, as sides for my cookout.   Service: they need help. I usually go on a weekday (after a bike ride), and they still have enough patrons to make the servers \"slow.\" They are friendly, but when you're starving, you're STARVIN'! (or fiening for a beer!)   Bonus: they are just off the military ridge trail (about a block - like most restaurants in Mt Horeb)!"}
{"text":"Mount Horeb is the Troll Capital of the World. It's a theme you will find all over town with many troll statues and carvings, along with quaint shops, many with Norwegian and other imports. The Grumpy Troll fits right in. Located in an old restored brick building, it has a very inviting wood interior, but the best part is the excellent food and beer. You will find a nice variety of delicious burgers and other sandwiches. I highly recommend the Reuben and the Prime Rib French Dip. The beer is hand crafted on site and has won many awards. Anyone that has advanced beyond Bud Light will surely appreciate the fine brews. I am particularly fond of Erik the Red and Spetsnaz Stout. Be assured that you will not leave here grumpy."}
{"text":"During the last three years, we've stopped at the Troll on our way home to Madison from Governor Dodge State Park. Yesterday was our last stop, for dinner anyway.  Two reasons. First, the vegetarian chili is the absolute worst chili I have ever come across. It was 95% black beans, so they either ran out of chili and just threw some beans in a bowl, or they use a cookbook that is missing some of its pages. In either case, it was awful.   Second, they closed the kitchen without asking us if we wanted anything else - which we did! The primary reason we stop at the Troll is for the deep-fried snickers. Were it not for this tasty dessert, we wouldn't stop here, especially when we keep hearing about this tasty little bistro which is also in Mt. Horeb. When it was time to order dessert, oops, sorry, the kitchen is closed. Oh, that's fine, we didn't want anything anyway. I'll just get back to work on this bowl-o-beans here. Sheesh!  The Troll does have some positives, such as good microbrews, a friendly staff and mostly decent ingredients. But whatever you do, don't get the veggie chili."}
{"text":"Pretty poor hostess. Had a group of 4 sitting at a table for 8 and asked our group of 7 to wait 45 for two tables of 4 to open up. Really too bad because we travelled to get there. Going to think twice about traveling to Mt. Horeb for this again."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I stopped in here during our mini-vacation to House on the Rock.  Pretty darn cool place!  Honestly, we were in Mount Horeb where everything seemed to close drastically early, and were about to drive back to the hotel when we spotted The Grumpy Troll.    Pretty awesome experience.  Being from Chicago, I am used to microbrews being abundant, but the beer was pretty impressive.  The food was also pretty darn awesome.  Loved the Grump Chips.   Note about this establishment:  I think other reviewers are being a little too hard on this place when it comes to food.  It's a brewpub.  Generally, people come to these places for the beer and grab a bite to eat while they're there, not the other way around.  I've never walked into a brewpub with food being the primary reason."}
{"text":"I stopped here while on a road trip to Wisconsin for a bite and a brief respite, encouraged by the highway signs. This was the only place listed that was not a chain. It's a couple miles off the road, but easy to get to and easy to get back from. I tried a wheat beer. It was good, if perhaps a tiny bit more bitter on the finish than I'm used to. BF had a red, which he thought was good. He ordered the \"Uff-Da\" pretzel, as he was not terribly hungry. Joke was on him. It was huge. It was bigger than a small pizza.It was 1 1/2 pounds of pretzel goodness. It came with two different mustard and a cheese sauce. The mustards were good, the pretzel was amazing, but the cheese was the generic day glow yellow crap. He also had a cup of beer cheese soup, unusual in that it contained andouille. He said it was okay, but the sausage addition was a bit odd. I had cheese curds, as we'd recently crossed the border into WI and they were calling to me (a former native). They were good, but not amazing. They make the white variety and serve them with a sweet mustard. This was a good spot and a nice stop from the road."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after taking a day trip to Cave of the Mounds. The downstairs had a 40 minute wait so we headed to the pizza parlor upstairs. They had a 25 minute wait but said we could get served at the bar right away if we didn't mind eating at the bar.  My friend got the brown porter which was delicious I got a non alcoholic Erdinger beer (I would love to try all the beer but I'm pregnant, so I couldn't-sad).  We got the Cosmic pizza which was amazing- the Thai chili sauce drizzled on the top was delicious.    Above all, I can't say enough about how good the service was!  Usually I don't expect quick and pleasant service of food when I sit at the bar at places since bartenders are usually all about serving drinks, not necessarily taking food orders. I didn't catch the bartenders name, but she was on her A game!  The place was busy but she kept up, never missing a beat. Greeted everyone as they walked in while muddling fruit for a great looking old fashioned and then moving straight to washing glasses and asking a worker passing by to grab some more water cups from downstairs when they had a minute so she wouldn't run out. We never waited for anything and she was so pleasant. It's refreshing to see good service and such a hard worker since unfortunately it is not that common in the restaurant business lately."}
{"text":"This place is good for a beer....just like any other bar in Mt. Horeb, except you will pay more because they brew their own. It's nothing special and the fact that they serve pizza when they are right next to Sole Sapori pizzeria is a joke! Stick with a beer and basic bar fare and you will be satisfied, for anything else MOVE ON!"}
{"text":"Grumpity grumpity groo... oh, wait, that's the Grumple.    En route to House on the Rock, we stopped here to build up our strength and drink a little liquid courage (boyfriend is afraid of dolls, and there's a freaking doll carousel at House on the Rock).    I am a sucker for hilarious, offbeat places so Mt. Horeb was a natural win for me.  Trolls everywhere.  I even brought my own because the concept of BYOT cracked me up to no end.    We did the little tasters of several of the beers, including a jalapeno one which wasn't as scary as it sounded.  I think the wheat was my fave.  Foodwise, we had started with the grump chips which were good and I enjoyed a half corned beef sandwich and chicken enchilada soup.  Boyfriend had some black bean dish which was massive and apparently enjoyable.    Our waitress was friendly and she laughed at my troll.  The atmosphere is a little blah, and could have used more trolls, but it's some tiny town in Wisconsin, it'll do."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, the town itself is very charming and welcoming to visitors. If you like beer you'll love their home brewed flavors and their prices are very fair for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Busy and a bit slower on service, but what can you expect from a one street town that gets slammed by people driving through.  We loved it!  The big pretzel was amazing...the kids would not stop eating it even when their food came.  Burgers were fabulous...I had the creole blue cheese.  Great beer sampler an friendly server."}
{"text":"Food was okay, place had nice ambience, cool and historical but for what they charged us for dinner I'd assume they know how to fry fish. It's Wisconsin for god sake!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST STOP when in Mount Horeb!  Great brewed on site beers, and a very diverse menu that caters to everyone from one to ninety two!  Friendly and fast service with a great overall staff tending to the details.  My personal favorite beer is called \"Maggie's\".  After a couple of glasses the world is in alignment!  Very clean and well maintained...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Troll on down to this place baby and have yourself a great time.   Fish and prime rib can't go wrong. Pizza can't be either."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grumpy Troll twice as I was passing through town. I wish I lived closer so I could come more often! This is a fun little place. The beers selection is limited to their brews - but they are all very good. We had the sampler the first time visiting and then this time around I had the Sunflower beer which was very refreshing. Both times, I walked out with purchasing some beer to go!   Their beer cheese soup is a must-have if you are in a soup mood. It was delicious. We also ordered the cheese curds which were a good greasy treat! I All of the food I saw being delivered out looked very tasty. I saw someone order the Bavarian pretzel which looked like it could feed a family of 4.   I love the ambiance of this place. Being an out-of-towner, I loved how friendly everyone was. It seems like a local establishment where many regulars know each other and the employees are all very attentive and nice as well.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A long drive for \"just ok\" food and service.  The appetizers we had were great!  Salad was awful!  NO flavor, no taste at all."}
{"text":"Had a perfect little lunch here. Beer was excellent. Service was friendly, and prompt. Would come back if I'm ever in this area again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner on Saturday night since I was staying in town. What a great place! Nice atmosphere, great friendly service. I sampled some beers and ended up enjoying the Trailside Wheat with some awesome appetizers, the cheesecurd's and grump chips with gorgonzola dip mmmm....  I also had the panfried walleye sandwich. The fish was so fresh and served on a warm toasted roll. This is the kind of place that has a lot of things on the menu you'd like to come back and try so If I'm every out on the search for grumpy trolls again I'll be stopping back in for more!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. Had a couple of brews and really enjoyed them. The food is nothing special so that's why I knocked off a star, but you are going there for the beer not the food. Bartender was really friendly and everyone at the bar was really friendly. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the mediocre food had to impact something!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and asked someone for a recommendation for dinner. Since we had our dog with us we figured we would just take it to go. We both ordered burgers and some cheese curds. My burger was The Happy Troll Burger with fries and the wife had the Skogstroll Burger with sweet potato tots. Both burgers were subpar at best and not much flavor. The fries and sweet potato tots were ok.....kinda hard to screw up frozen food. The cheese curds were terrible and a waste of money. We were thinking of just stopping at Culver's first, but wanted to support local businesses but looks like we made the wrong choice this time. Next time we're in town we won't be eating here."}
{"text":"Again, found this place on Yelp.  So I looked up the menu and my eyes immediately found the soft pretzel. A ONE AND A HALF POUND soft pretzel mind you. I was sold.  So away we went. There was a wait, but that was okay. We looked over the menu while were waiting. When we were seated, we were ready to go.  When they brought that pretzel out - well - it was - amazing. Very tasty and we enjoyed the dipping trio that it comes with.  My kids each got a turkey BLT (minus the \"T\"), my husband a burger (I forget which variety) and I had the reuben. I got the grump chips with mine, which were very tasty. Chips with parmesan cheese baked on top, with a seasoning (reminded me of a taco seasoning). Very tasty.  Food was good. Service was good. Place was busy the whole time we were there (a Saturday afternoon)."}
{"text":"Good burgers, friendly service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I think Benjamin Franklin said it best, \"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\"  The Grumpy Troll makes me happy. They brew a ton of their own beer. My boyfriend and I were on a mission on the eve of New Years Eve. We wanted to bring back the most delicious brews for our following evening. Mission accomplished. Left with a few growlers. $15/ growler and $12 for refills. ALLriiiight.   We started with the sampler which consisted of 12 - 3.5oz glasses. There were only 2 of the 12 that I didn't care for. My favorite was the Freedom IPA. The BF's favorite was Eric the Red.... and the Maggie. The most interesting of all was the Slow Eddie. So unique. Brewed with real jalapeno peppers. I loved it. I drank it while chowing down on some amazing fried cheese curds. It's a light tasting, thirst quenching then the bite comes in. You can smell the peppers. It's not spicy on your tongue, but gives you a sense of it. You'd have to try it to know.   The Brew-master came by our table to chat. Asked us all sorts of questions and welcomed us to town. Helped us understand a little more about some of our favorite selections.   We had lunch and enjoyed our beer samples. Both of us feeling a slight buzz shortly after we started. Decent food, good burger, good fries. They have some interesting things on the menu, and I really wish I could have tried more. I had a quesadilla that had chicken, andouille sausage, artichokes and some other stuff. It was good. I really wanted to try the artichoke cakes, but there were only two of us and we had other breweries to attend that day."}
{"text":"Food: Main floor delicious pub food and delectable brews.  Pizzeria upstairs keeps improving every time we go.   Kids: Good for with the kids or without.  If there is a wait go upstairs to the Pizzeria. Never disappointed and not to be missed when visiting Mount Horeb."}
{"text":"I have found myself visiting Mt. Horeb over the years, and have tried to give Grumpy Troll a chance on several different occasions. The beer can be pretty good, if you know what to order, and the menu has improved in recent years. Recently, I thought I would again give it a try, and to avoid the noisy lunchtime crowds, stopped in at 3 on a weekday afternoon. There was a fussy baby, and another small kid who shouted, rather than talked. This is the norm for the place, which the owner seems to encourage (according to other reviews on this site). Granted there are almost all hard surfaces, and nothing to absorb the sound. Bottom line, If you enjoy being jolted out of your by random shrieks, this is your place. I won't be back, but I will encourage those with small children that this is the place for them."}
{"text":"This restaurant and traditional brewery is amazing and a must visit if you're passing or staying near Mt. Horeb.  Also if you like beer, you will like this place as they have 12 unique local beers on tap that you can try; they have a sampler ordering option which we found was great.  There is a pub area and a dining area.  There is also an area at the entrance of the restaurant where you can just go sit and relax after buying a beer inside.   The food is wonderful, well served and quickly prepared. And the staff is wonderful.  Pricing is decent too.  Enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"The Grumpy Troll is an awesome place to eat while in town. Hey! They even gave me an ACTUAL medium cooked burger. You must have their Uff Da pretzel as an appetizer and if you're looking for a taste of Wisconsin, the Grevling burger is the thing to order. Also, if Kristy is in the house, request her. She is a great waitress who will ensure your meal and service is top notch."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers. The vegetarian black bean chili is really yummy. My favorite is the chicken enchilada soup. I had this at Chili's, but it was just some cheese in a bowl. This is really a tasty soup. New Orleans blackened chicken is wonderful. It is just a nice place to unwind, eat and have a great beer."}
{"text":"Every year we complete our annual Labor Day Camping trip by visiting the Grumpy Troll.  What's better than finishing out your camping weekend with a little brew sampler.  This year, as in all years prior, we wandered into the Grumpy Troll and asked for a table for 10 on Labor Day.  First they told us that it would be a 30-45 minute wait for a group that big.  We asked if we could sit outside (they have a very small courtyard and we tend to sit out there every year) but they informed us that there was a bee problem in the outdoor area.  They said they would take our phone number and call us when our table was ready, so we decided to walk/shop the two blocks in town.  After approximately 45 minutes we returned to the Grumpy Troll at which time the hostess informed us it would be at least 20 more minutes if we wanted to sit together.  We thought that was an odd comment as we had already waited 45 minutes for the purpose of sitting together.  Now our wait time just went from 30-45 minutes to 65 minutes.  What we realized very quickly is the pub might have been named after the hostess and when we asked to speak to her supervisor, she told us she was the supervisor.  She even had the gall to say \"Do you want my job?\" in which the reply was \"we don't want your job, we just want you to do your job.\"  Needless to say, we will likely skip this place in the future, but thank you Main Street Pub and Grill for being so pleasant when we arrived with our party of 10 and providing us pub food just as tasty as the Grumpy Troll with a whole lot less attitude."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in Mt Horeb for a short visit and discovered this place after seeing ads off the highway. Grumpy Troll Pub and Brewery is... a pub and brewery. I actually don't happen to like pub food all that much, since it seems that most pub eateries think you can throw garbage in a fryer and serve it and call yourself a restaurant. That doesn't seem to be the case at Grumpy Troll. We got fried mac n gouda cheese bites, beer cheese soup, a Reuben, and fish and chips. The mac n gouda cheese bites were quite good - if you've had mac n cheese bites elsewhere, then you can imagine what they taste like here. The beer cheese soup was not very good, unfortunately, as it was way too salty - it served better as a dip for fries than it did a proper soup. The reuben was good quality for a pub (not as good as what you'd find at a quality deli, understandably) and the fried beer battered cod was delicious. The beer battered fries were incredibly. Absolutely incredible, and I'm pretty neutral toward fries, but these were really great, even after hours later when I was eating leftovers.  I give the food that I had a 3.5/5. But I had some of the best beer in recent memory here. We got a couple pints of the Trailside Wheat Hefeweizen and immediately fell in love. We actually got 3 more growlers of the stuff while we were in town. We were so fond of this beer, my rating gets boosted from a 3.5 to 4.5/5 stars.  Downsides are that the pizzeria is not open on Monday. However, notably, a lot of places are closed on Mondays in Mount Horeb, so it's not specific to Grumpy Troll."}
{"text":"Stopped for an early dinner and we loved it.  My husband had the chicken ceasar salad and I had the blackened penne pasta.  Our server Kathy was amazing.  Fast attentive service and great food.  We were expecting more bar type food, but we're pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The selection of beer is outstanding. I did a sampling of all of their beers and not one was a disappointment. The cheese curds were some of the best I've had in Wisconsin. Burger was good."}
{"text":"I specifically visited Mt. Horeb because I did a search for brewpubs and came across the Grumpy Troll. I was not disappointed.  The decor was fairly typical for a brewpub. Clean with wood accents and the requisite brewing equipment view. It is a little on the small side compared to the big corporate brewpubs, but there is nothing wrong with that. I liked the cozy feel and it makes sense considering the size of the town that the Grumpy Troll is hiding in.  So we came for the beer and we tried everything that they had. We started drinking pints, but later found out from the manager that they offer samplers as well. ($1 / 5oz) The waitress had failed to mention that to us. It was a good thing because I am not sure I could have made it through all of the beers otherwise. The selection was broad enough to keep a beer lover like me satisfied all night long.  Maggie (cask conditioned) flowery, fruity... hard to describe, but delicious! Served at the perfect slightly cool temperature.  Maggie: The normally tapped version of the Maggie was also very good. This beer is a stand out among the beers offered at the Grumpy Troll. We liked this so much that we took a growler home for the night. (But be careful, the local laws won't let them sell a growler after 9PM We were practically rushed out the door at 8:59 with ours.)  Curly: dark and slightly smokey. Very pleasant tasting. My wife liked this one more than I did.  Trailside Wheat: smells great - like bananas. Good fruity flavor, but could stand to be a bit more flavorful.  Saison: good initial aroma, but very watery tasting. Kinda sour as it warms. I have had other examples of this style of beer and liked them very much, so I was very disappointed. I would not get this again.  Dry Irish Stout: creamy, deliciously dark and chocolatey.  Spetsnaz: good, dark - like burnt chocolate, but in a good way. A little more sour than the Irish stout, but good in a different way.  BIPA: bitter, citrousy like a bitter grapefruit. Not unpleasant, but not very impressive when compared to the Maggie.  Freedom IPA: nicely bitter, but I couldn't help comparing it to the Maggie that I had earlier and it just didn't stand out.  Eric the Red: good flavor without and extremes - just right. Not too anything. Nicely balanced, easy drinking beer.  Captain Fred: kinda stinky aroma. Not a horrible taste, but I just don't like this style of beer very much.  Slow Eddie: very mild jalepeno flavor. I am not a big fan of this style, but I thought I would try it to make sure.   In between all that beer we ate a little food too.  Wisconsin Cheddar Curds: yummy! Nice batter based coating rather than the usual crumb based breading. Good cheddar flavor. The accompanying honey mustard dipping sauce was just right.  Troll's Beer & Cheese soup: not quite as flavorful as other beer/cheese soups I've had. A little watery.  Brat: tasted good, but nothing special. I was in Wisconsin, so I felt like I had to have one.  Walleye: this was a decently sized portion of well cooked fish. The Grump chips were fun. Saut√©ed green bean were a nice side dish too.   The one thing that bugged me about this place is that it was very \"family\" friendly. There were too many kids. At one point my wife and I changed tables when a table of 10 was set up next to us with 6 kids. Come on people, it's a brewpub, not a Chuck E Cheese! I mentioned this to the manager, but he was proud of the kid friendliness of his establishment. I guess there are just not enough people like me to keep him in business.  Overall I would go back again. In fact, we went back again the following night for a few more beers. We also left with several large bottles of their beer to enjoy once we got back to Illinois. I don't know when we will make it back, but if you are in Mt. Horeb, be sure to tip a pint at the Grumpy Troll."}
{"text":"My wife and I were entertaining friends from out of town and decided to try a new place--and we we very pleased with the Grumpy Troll!  My beer was a bit hoppy for my tastes, so next time I'll try their sampler glasses.  The four of us ordered very diverse items and were thrilled with each one.  My fish tacos were the best I've ever had anywhere and I can't wait to return and do their fish fry   It was a Monday evening right at dinnertime, and the restaurant was moderately busy, but we were seated immediately.  The service was very good and the only reason that I'm not giving them top marks is that we had a tribe of small children in the next booth constantly pounding on the common wall between us.  Had we not had guests, I probably would have said something, but I didn't want to look like a.......grumpy  troll.    We'll be returning soon"}
{"text":"Amazing cheese curds. The service isn't always the best but good food and better beer."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time, we ate downstairs. The beer is good the food is 'meh'. I ordered chicken wings that were not good. The salads looked great, though! The second time was tonight. We veered upstairs to the pizzeria. Holy smokes was it good!! Crust was thin and perfectly cooked. Toppings were plentiful with lots of veggies!! I will definitely be back upstairs to the pizzeria. The menu was well priced and the service was good:)."}
{"text":"The folks are always friendly! They offer suggestions and we typically bite. The beer is pretty good if you like IPs. The food tho.... Just delish! Fish tacos to the fantastic Reuben. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We make a trip to the Grumpy Troll on our way home from the Dells every year.  It is usually really busy by the time we get there with around an hour wait. Is it worth the wait? Yes.  Food is great and the beer selection is always top notch.  The servers we have had have always been helpful and go above and beyond in spite of probably being really busy.  I have never had anything to eat here that I wouldn't order again. Well worth the trip.  Make sure you check out the town when you visit, it is really a cool little town."}
{"text":"As many others have also done, we stopped in here after taking a day trip to Cave of the Mounds.   This place is great! We ate in the downstairs \"pub\" part - fantastic menu with lots of great pub fare like fish and chips, burgers, brats, and so on. And their beer selection is really nice too.   Relaxed atmosphere, and (at least for lunch) very kid friendly. Our server even brought the kids freeze-pops for dessert after they finished their food. They have a great kids' menu too by the way.   Well worth the stop if you're in the area.  Oh, and definitely get the giant pretzel appetizer!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I originally went for beer and fish fry on a Friday afternoon, but ended up not having room for fish after eating a pound of pretzel. It seems absurd but a pizza size soft pretzel was just perfect for the flight of beer! The regular mustard was yucky, the cheese was too nacho-y, but the honey mustard was just right. The flight is $15 for (12) 4 ounce drinks. I'm a dark beer kinda girl so I liked the porter and the stout, but also the schwarz BIB and the farmhouse Sunflower. Hubby liked the hefeweizen and the saison. A couple were just too hoppy for us, but that's just our taste. Bathrooms clean. Waitstaff mostly middle aged women and very pleasant in an informal way. Be prepared for carved trolls all over the town. Also, it didn't matter to us, but the hostess is at the back of the restaurant and you really do have to go upstairs if you want to order pizza. And if you sit upstairs, pizza (and beer) is all you can order. Something about their kitchen setup..."}
{"text":"Stopped in looking for something different and we got it. The special today was Italian Meatloaf, Yumm! It was huge, I had to force myself to stop eating. It came with homemade mashed potatoes, garlic toast and green beens with rice and cranberries.  We need to come back when we are by this way again, there are a lot of items I want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from Governor Dodge State Park in Wisconsin this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised. The food was A-OK and the waitress was constantly absent but the place was so cute I didn't really mind.  They also have an interesting selection of their own beers. They let my companion and I sample a half dozen before buying a \"growler\" (where have I been while this word was proliferating?? I had never heard it before!) of beer for $15 ($12 for a refill). I didn't think the beers really matched their descriptions overall, but what do I know?  Basically it is a good, not great, place for a bite to eat on your way back from the frozen north!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food.    One of the best Bloody Mary's I have had. The prime rib sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the grumpy troll. A little hard to find in downtown mt horeb as its off a side street. But worth a slow down while driving through town to find. They brew their own beers and root beer here and you can see the large tanks when you enter the greeters area. The resteraunt is clean and staff friendly. The food is excellent. I ordered a grumpy troll burger and beer battered fries. My husband a rueben. We had the root beer since we don't like beer. Very good. A must go destination if you are traveling towards or away from Mt horeb/ Madison area."}
{"text":"Solid burgers, great beer and really friendly service. It's definietly a small town place. Parking is a bitch though, all street and very few spaces."}
{"text":"I stopped at the Grumpy Troll on a whim while driving back to Madison from Cave of the Mounds.  This was probably the best decision I made that day.    The atmosphere in the Troll was great.  The beer I tried was cold, crisp and refreshing (Angry Fred).  I was really impressed with the variety of brews they offered.  I think there were 10 or 12.    For lunch, I had a bowl of their beer cheese soup and a salad.  You can't really screw up a salad, but I was impressed that they use spring mix lettuce instead of blah iceberg lettuce.  The beer cheese soup was pretty incredible.  While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it had a delightful taste - and chunks of sausage for some extra flavor.  The people I was with had the whitefish sandwich with fries and the chicken bacon ranch sandwich with the grump chips and gorgonzola dipping sauce.  I tried all of it and it was GREAT!  The chips and dipping sauce were particularly awesome.  All of this in Mt. Horeb?  Who knew?"}
{"text":"Downstairs is a little busy and usually has a lot of families in the dining area.   The best part about this brewery is the pizza parlor upstairs. Has a second bar too. The pizza is itself 5 Star. They have awesome toppings and specials too plus you can do half and half. Thinner crust pie. They have other apps too and a good beer list on draught."}
{"text":"I am still dreaming about this place...Stopped off here on a weekend trip with my girlfriend. I had read about the brewery and saw there was a fall festival going on - figured as good a place as any to stop for lunch. Well we breezed through the fall festival but could've spent all weekend here! As for the food, I can't comment a lot...we split some cheese curds and a sandwich, which were decent. But the beer is worth the trip alone...by a longshot! This ranks at the top of all the breweries I've visited. My girlfriend was in love with the ginger jasmie beer they had. I agree with others about the slow service but the beer was so good it was enough to keep it at 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"We decided to break out of our rut on our most recent road trip and followed the very well placed signage to Grumpy Troll for lunch. After perusing the menu on line, I had my heart set on pizza and was a little disappointed when I found out that pizza was only served for dinner. All was well, however, when I decided to have a walnut burger (an option for all burgers) I chose to customize mine because the standard options were not appealing for a veggie burger. The roll was fresh and my burger was tasty. The Grump fries were also good, however, they were a little \"glued together\" by the Parmesan cheese on top. Annessa, our waitress, was great - her sharp with and easy banter made lunch even more enjoyable!  I'm generally not a fan of Wisconsin \"pub food\" but there were enough options to satisfy this vegetarian. Well worth the trip off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Must not be a lot of competition in Mt Horeb because the place always seems crowded and I really don't see why. The staff is pretty rude, and they always offer you a seat at the bar that never has one.  They always try and push you to the pizza bar upstairs. The pizza there is ok, but the staff are bothered that you are interrupting their texting. The food downstairs is typical bar food.  The beer is passable, but well below what you can get in most places these days."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, good service.  I had the Grumpy burger, my wife the Black bean burger, not quite a burger. Mostly it was open face black bean taco served on pita bread.  My Grump burger was bacon cheese burger, good but a little too charred fort taste. Beer was Troll's gold lager, delicious. Service was good. I would recommend coming here, overall was a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed the food each time. I highly recommend the burgers which are sourced locally (the meat that is). The atmosphere and staffing is quaint and unique to Mt. Horeb. Friendly, attentive to detail and obsessed with local tradition and folklore."}
{"text":"I usually don't miss an opportunity to check out a local brewery, but somehow the Grumpy Troll managed to fly under my radar for a long time - perhaps because it's the same distance to Mt. Horeb as it is to Madison.  I wish I would've checked this place out sooner!  Their biggest fault is that their facility is too small to satisfy demand on a busy day.  I sampled all their brews and I would've been happy with a pint of any of them.  The Bourbon Barrel Stout was the hands-down winner!  The food was good and reasonably priced.  The Uff-Da Pretzel appetizer is a sight in and of itself.  Don't expect to be overwhelmed, but this place will definitely meet any expectations you have of a small, local microbrewery!  We will absolutely be making a return trip!"}
{"text":"We left Cave Of The Mounds and decided we wanted to stop somewhere close for dinner.  I found this place on Yelp and decided we should give it a try. This place appealed to me because of all thier famous craft beers.  I decided to go with thier option of flights so I could try several different styles being it was my first time having thier beers.  Very tasty!  The food was great...  We actually went upstairs and had the garlic knots as an appitizer, the pesto mac-n-cheese with bacon topped with fresh basil and the piggy meat lovers pizza.  Mmmm mmm.  Everything was perfectly cooked and fresh. The place is a huge venue, very friendly staff, indoor and outdoor seating, and great tasting food.  What more could you ask for.  If in the area stop and try this place.  You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Very good food, had the soup and 1/2 sandwich reuben which was wonderful. My husband had the chicken quesadilla and said it was one of the best he has had. The mules were also delicious and the bartender very friendly."}
{"text":"We came here to watch a Packer game with family and had a super fun time. Grumpy Troll has a family restaurant downstairs and a pizzeria/pub upstairs. We had pizza upstairs and it was delicious, as well as a tasty artichoke dip and chips. The large selection of handcrafted beer is tasty, especially if you're into the IPA styles.  To me, atmosphere is a huge part of the dining experience. Grumpy Troll is great. I love the historic building. It's renovated respectfully to its character, yet is still fun and  suitable for its purpose. The staff was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry is the way to go. If you can't make it on Fridays then try one of their awesome burgers. They have a pizzeria (separate part of the restaurant. I believe it's upstairs) that we have yet to try. Great beer selection and very kid friendly. The kids get a fun free treat after dinner. Parking can be a pain some days. It's a small place, so if you don't eat around 5 530 then plan on waiting. I've never waited longer then 25 minutes."}
{"text":"First time visit tonight.  Stopped in for an early dinner and was not disappointed.  I had the Hoppa Lopa IPA and my wife the Grumpy Bloody Mary.  The IPA was smooth with some nice citrus flavor as expected.  Not quite the bite of other IPAs but a solid choice.  Both drinks were very good.  We had the fried green beans for an appetizer.  The cucumber dip was mild but very good.  The green beans were deep fried a golden brown and were excellent.  For dinner I had the walleye entree while my wife had the prime rib.  I really enjoyed the walleye, nicely pan fried with a light touch to it.  Both of entrees came with a vegetable dish composed of beets, carrots and potatoes nicely diced.  This dish was the weakest part of the dinner, rather bland and tasteless.  Service was good but not extraordinary.  Service staff seemed to help each other out well.  Overall, we are looking forward to coming back again.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food!  The pizza upstairs is great too.  I am not a beer fan but they have nice wine choices and great food."}
{"text":"This place has not changed much from my first time visiting a few years ago.   The service is ok, not bad and not great. Maybe have servers stop by a bit more frequently?   The food is ok to good. It really depends on what you order. I enjoyed the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The fish is good too. A family member ordered a flatbread and it was not even remotely good. I think they've since removed it from the menu.   The beer here is ok. I've only enjoyed \"Erik the Red.\" The others I just didn't care for. This place always seem to be busy in the bar, the dining area comes and goes as far as traffic.  I'd maybe come back if I knew that they improved the service."}
{"text":"A rather trendy, upscale brew pub in a touristy little town known for it's trolls and mustard.  I had the Grumpy Troll burger - 7 oz preformed ground beef patty with bacon and choice of cheese.  I had it with beer battered fries all for $10.  A little pricey for a decent (not particularly noteworthy) burger.  I didn't try the beer since I was traveling and already a little drowsy, but they have some interesting brews.  The dining area could use a good cleaning with dust piled high on the open green painted duct work."}
{"text":"Was great food, especially the burgers at a good price. The service is also very nice. And its really neat to see inside of the brewery a little while you eat."}
{"text":"Great beer, average burgers, decent pasta and good service and ambience. The place is often busy but the wait isn't very long, about 15 minutes. You can pick up a beer while u wait. We tried the veggie blue cheese pasta and mushroom burger with side of cheese curds. Pasta turned out better than burger which was strange. They have some trivia cards on each table which was entertaining while you wait for food."}
{"text":"Fun place, friendly people, great staff. The Grumpy Troll Burger is very good and recommended. They have a very good selection of beers... From light too weak to dark, take your pick"}
{"text":"Been here many times, and always return for the beer.  They menu is OK, nothing really stands out as a favorite but it always tastes good with the beer.  I love their dark beers, my favorite is the Amnesia- it is dark and sweet.  We will go back for more delicious brew."}
{"text":"LOVED the cheese curds!! I'm not a Wisconsin native, so perhaps I'm not the best to judge, but I absolutely loved them! Gooey goodness!   The burger was pretty good-- threw some extra cheese on there and the veggies were fresh! The side of chips was delicious-- also perfectly seasoned and with toasted cheese!  The enchilada soup and side salad were pretty good as well; however, the raspberry vinaigrette was far too sweet (I actually think they might have forgotten to add the vinegar because it was sweet enough for a pastry).   The service was great and the outside patio was wonderful as well.   Wish I would've had more room in my belly for the deep fried Snickers bar, but the portions were huge and I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great service friendly people, love the curds,  not a bad place to stop and eat. Great location"}
{"text":"As one other person mentioned, mostly hype. I didn't even finish my burger cause it was dry and tasted lousy. The Grumpy chips were supposed to be thick cut fried potatoes with melted cheese. We got paper thin, rock hard, gravel tasting things with what looked like burnt artificial cheese substitute. If you're looking for mediocre food, served in a fairly nice place with a cool name, this is for you. There are too many pubs out there with actual good food to waste your time on hype."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Saturday night after visiting Cave of the Mounds. Was told wait would be 30 mins, ended up being an hour. But you can order drinks at the bar and there is seating in the entryway. Food was good, service was prompt."}
{"text":"We built our own burgers and they were done perfectly. The cucumber ranch salad dressing was great. The Norsmen brew was excellent! Nice, clean bar atmosphere with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was atrocious all heated up. Manager/owner was less than friendly. Mold on food. Ugh"}
{"text":"I've had two versions of their BLT and thought both were very good. On my first visit my uncle was visiting from out of town and my mom suggested we all check out Mt. Horeb as they were having a street festival/art fair.  We ate at Grumpy Troll for lunch and everyone liked what they ordered. I had the grilled chicken BLT with cheese.  It was really good.  My second visit I was dining by myself as I was passing through town for work. I took the waitress' suggestion and had the chicken salad BLT with avocado. It was very good. I happened to be working with some locals and was told locals have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant because it can be quite pricey.  I think it depends on what you order as they have quite a variety on the menu.  I paid about 13 bux for my tasty sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"This brew pub is amazing! I just moved to Wisconsin and I fell in love with this place immediately. I went upstairs for their pizza and it was delicious and I drank a few of their finest beers (still need to try some). But I had a Maggie and it was very hoppy and strong but good, then I had an Eric the Red and it was lighter but scrumptious! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Basically the only reason I've ever been in Mt Horeb is because of the Mustard Museum.  I'm not going to lie about that.  But, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Grumpy Troll kinda across the street.  They serve some pretty tasty food, and although Im not really a fan of beer, my dining companions have thought that the little beer sampler thing was good enough to get a Growler of beer to go.  That's right, a Growler, which is basically a big glass jug."}
{"text":"Returned here this summer after a 5 year hiatus.  It's still not bad but the service is absolutely abyssmal. We were shown to a table...and then promptly forgotten about. It was busy but my family and I sat there for a good 10 minutes, with servers coming and going, and we only got service after asking one of the passing servers at random. We understand that it was a Friday night but it just wasn't THAT busy, especially since the hostess station was literally next to our table."}
{"text":"Go for the beer. The food. Not so much. The dining room is set up in such a way that it is EXTREMELY loud making conversation very difficult. The beers were good and would stop by again for a quick beer at the bar and have a meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"great burgers, good service that is efficient. We had a table of 11 hangry biker chicks and our waiter Jacob was plesant and accomodating and barely batted an eye.. .even AFTER we told him all individual checks! 20 minute wait for a table on a glorious Sunday out for a motorcycle ride. Wish we could have imbibed in a growler but we had to hop on our bikes and get back to Chicago. We sampled Burgers, Salads, Patty Melts and vegetarian option with Trempleau Walnut Burgers! Everyone left full and happy"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the fiance a while back. I had their root beer and an Erik the Red brat with homemade chips. The root beer has a very vanilla forward taste which was interesting but it felt more like a cross between cream soda and root beer than a straight root beer. The brat plate was the real highlight for me locally made bratwurst done with their Erik the Red brew served on a pretzel bun with whole grain mustard. It is some of my favorite things German all in one bite."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a lot of character.  Our waitress Sandy seemed very experienced and provided friendly service.  Enjoyed the grilled salmon summer salad, but I asked them to prepare my salmon on a clean pan instead of on the grill.  This salad and especially its dressing were very tasty; lots of junk (cranberries, gorgonzola, apples and slivered almonds).  My salad came with a surprise corn muffin, but I didn't taste it.   If you're not from the area, be sure to stroll up and down Main St looking for troll sculpture.    The pizza shop isn't open for lunch on weekdays but we're glad we stayed and dined downstairs instead."}
{"text":"My mom and I drove 90 minutes just to have lunch here and enjoy the fall colors on the drive. It started out as a basic destination, but now we will have to make it a more regular thing! The service was fast and friendly even at a busy time of day. The food and drink choices were surprisingly diverse and different than other places. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Diddnt have the amazing cheese curds, maybe that would have helped. Had a mushroom and Swiss burger, wife had a walleye sandwhich. Both were ok, but not enough to go back for. Service left something to be desired. Felt like we were forgotten several times."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! They always have 12  beers on tap in a rotating schedule with new ones every few weeks. The food is deliciously prepared with lots of unique choices you wouldn't expect in a small town. Cheese curds are some of the best we have had. Boneless wings are great with 4 sauces to choose from. Salads are fresh and tasty. The fish fry is awesome on Fridays. Prime rib great on Saturdays. Servers are top notch. Best bartenders: Rob, Nate, Dawn. Best servers: Angela, Taylor, Kathy, Marca. You should go. Now."}
{"text":"Good variety of brews. I like lighter beers and found the Sunflower refreshing.  The Blood Mary was delish but didn't come with all the fixens the menu said it would and no beer back!!!??  This is the FIRST bar in Wisconsin that didn't serve a beer back with a bloody mary.  Epic fail, Grumpy Troll!  Overall, nice place."}
{"text":"I'm not from the Madison area but I heard of this town nearby full of trolls! Lol So naturally as a child of the 80's and a lover of treasure trolls, I had to check out Mount Horeb! And since I love beer, I ended up at the Grumpy Troll!   When you walk in, you have a choice to go upstairs to the pizzeria or enter in the main bar/dining area to the right. I was by myself so I opted for a seat at the bar. I ordered api t of their IPA and was pleasantly surprised! Solid IPA from the local brew house!   I ordered the BLT with a side of the beer battered French fries for my entree. The BLT was fantastic with the buttered toast and thick cut applewood smoked bacon! Perfect ratio of bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo! And trust me, you can make a BLT wrong! It's all about the proportions! The fries were perfect as well! Great flavor and I ordered it with a side of honey mustard for dipping them in, yum!   I will def be back to eat here and try some of their different variety's of beer!"}
{"text":"What makes the Grumpy Troll a 5 star pub is a combination of outstanding award-winning hand crafted beers, phenomenal comfort food options, and a really great staff. The beer sampler is awesome if you want to try a wide variety. The burgers are really good. We have not tried the pizza yet but we have heard that it's great as well."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere.  If you're in Mt. Horeb, the Grumpy Troll is a fun place to catch a quick bite to eat.  I don't think it's as good as The Great Dane, but it's a place I will return to many times.  The beer is decent; the food is good."}
{"text":"This isn't the best place in town. It's dark and kind of gloomy (well duh - it's related to trolls), and there's not a private parking lot, but it remains a favorite that draws plenty of out-of-towners consistently, and there are a few good reasons.  1.  The beer. It's brewed here, they have quite the selection, and it's good beer.  I'm more of a Bloody kinda gal (and they have those too--also good).  2.  If you like pub food, they have a good selection of German-y type pub food. Burgers, fish fry, and locally made brats.  I'm not really one for pub food most of the time, so I'm often ordering the special, which could be blackened salmon salad (this remains my standout favorite) or bruschetta chicken, etc. The food is good. Is it the best I've ever had?  No. But it's good.  3.  They also brew their own root beer. I tried it last night, and on first sip thought it was amazing. But then the more I drank, the more it started to taste like Play-Doh.  I don't even know how that makes sense...  but I won't ever order it again.  4.  This is one of the only spots in town that's open past 6pm.  So that kind of gives them a major edge.  5.  The bathrooms are clean. VERY clean.   7.  They have many TVs, each tuned to something different. This could be a plus or minus for you. It's not my thing. I find it very distracting. But it's cool if you have a few people in your party who want to watch a couple games simultaneously.  The staff here are hit or miss. Last night, my young waitress was spot-on. But I came out for a happy hour a couple months ago with a friend and a different waitress was notably inattentive and lackluster in general.  If you're looking for amazing food, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun pub atmosphere with good food and locally brewed beer, you'll probably at least be satisfied.  That's all the news that's fit to print!  :)"}
{"text":"Great place for beer and a fabulous soft pretzel.  That's the only reason that I gave this place 3 stars.  However,  the food was NOT great.  Okay, it wasn't even good.  I was disappointed in the quality of the food and lack of fresh ingredients.  You know it's bad when the waitress steers you away from the vegetable of the day because the vegetables are not fresh..  But, if you are out for a beer and appetizer it's worth the stop.   Note:  The hostess stand is located in the back of the restaurant so if it's busy be prepared to maneuver through a bunch of people to get there."}
{"text":"This is a great rest spot while out riding motorcycles in Wisconsin's Driftless area. Nice shady outdoor patio and comfortable indoor seating. We visited this past Sunday.  I had the Skogstroll burger topped with loads of mushrooms and Swiss cheese with sweet potato tots. Holy moly those tots. Mighty fine. The burger was done perfectly and tasted super fresh. One of the best burgers I've had. I washed it all down with a Trailside Wheat --- loved it. My friend had the Hoppa Loppa IPA which was perfectly hoppy. Friendly staff and fast service. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"If I could give Grumpy Troll a 10 star rating I would, this place is for sure worth trucking out to mount horeb for!  We got there at 5:20 on a Saturday and there was a 30 minute wait. They had the badger game on and the bartender was very attentive, so the wait was no problem! The beer is absolutely delicious. My favorite was the sunflower and my husbands favorite was the dunken-weizen. Beers are reasonably priced which was a pleasant surprise given how many awards they have won.  The wait time was as quoted, and service was EXCELLENT once we were seated. We both had burgers which were great, and the sweet potato tot appetizer was awesome. We are going back this weekend with friends and can't wait to try the 1.5 pound pretzel!"}
{"text":"The place is always crowded so plan your time wisely. All the beer and food are incredible and you will be impressed. Great stop on any southern Wisconsin brewery tour."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a menu that has a lot to choose from. Came here with my family for my mother's birthday. They were accommodating to a large group. We liked their beer selection as well. My favorite thing our table ordered was the chicken pot pie. It was so delicious. I was however very disappointed in my burger. When I ordered it I was very excited to try it because it had cheese curds on the burger. When I tried the burger though the only taste I got was that of a grill. It was actually very hard to even finish my food because it taste so bad.  But everyone else enjoyed their meals.  I would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, and the service needs to improve.   To the server... You should come by and see if the food was correct. My order got screwed up, but there was no server around to let them know. If you want to increase your tips, then increase your ticket amount. We would have ordered dessert, but you never asked. You just ran by, dropped the check on our table, and didn't even ask how was the meal.  Do better next time."}
{"text":"Fish fry is great!  We love the cheese curds and chips.  My husband really likes the beer- too bitter for me.  Booths are the best place to sit."}
{"text":"We love stopping in this brew pub when ever we are in the area. Excellent service and great food. Some classic burger meals and some innovative twists that include a burger topped with a brat, sauerkraut, and wisconsin cheddar, or you can build your own. The beer battered French fries are a favorite, but you could opt for sweet potato tatter tots. Plenty of other items to order from soups and salads to walleye and fish tacos. A lot more I haven't mentioned. Pretty much something for everyone and they do have a gluten free menu too. A variety of beers and you could order a sampling of the beers they brew in house, 4 oz tasting glasses for a very reasonable price. Don't miss this fantastic find if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"So tasty! What a treasure trove of gourmet twists hidden in a pub atmosphere, with a dozen micros brewed on site! So much fun for kids and adults alike!!"}
{"text":"Just north of New Glarus and west of Madison, the Grumpy Troll Pub and Brewery is a place worth checking out. Great beer selection, good staff and good food = winning!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! A bit busy, but that's expected at a nice place. The food is delicious and their home brewed beers are one of a kind! I highly recommend his place if your driving thru town and need a place to eat!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner the first night of our mini vacation. It was not overly busy, but we headed to the back area of the bar to avoid the crying baby. We had a clear view of the window looking into the brewery part, which was cool, except that aside from about 30 seconds, the lights were off in the brewery.  The dining room was very poorly lit. Christopher and I both had to use a flashlight to read the menu. Ok, I have old eyes, but this was a tad ridiculous. The food was fairly good. I had a French dip beef sandwich, with their home made chips. I enjoyed it, though the prime rib was a little overcooked for my taste. Christopher had a burger of some sort, which he pronounced \"good\".  I ordered a seasonal special drink called a \"Peach Cobbler\". It tasted overwhelmingly of Cinnamon, and I really did not like it. The server noticed I had not really put a dent in it and asked me if I didn't like it. I told her my issue with the drink and she took it off the bill. Christopher had a house brewed bear called the \"Jingle Bell\", which he liked well enough.  All in all, it was a decent enough but if I come through the area again, I will probably try another establishment."}
{"text":"Had the troll burger, it was well seasoned and cooked mid rare. I had the pilsner; it was clean and refreshing. Babe had the salad and BLT, both were made perfectly. Also it was a busy Friday lunch, and they handled the crowd expertly. Second time here and everything was great!"}
{"text":"Here's my new local brew pub which I'll try not to frequent too much. The several times I've been here were busy times, Thursday-Sunday, and the place was a big noisy party every time. Big festive crowd, and busy, friendly staff. I love their Maggie Imperial IPA and the Hoppa Loppa. Beer prices are reasonable. The menu is a pretty standard pub fare, and there is a special room upstairs just for pizza. I've not tried the food, but everything else here makes me want to become a regular. A must stop if you are visiting beautiful downtown Mount Horeb. You wouldn't want to miss a big troll party, now would you?"}
{"text":"The beer and wine were great, reasonably priced too! Grump chips were good, a nice change from the local plain pub chips you get. I ordered the Gorgonzola salad and my boyfriend the Italian wrap, and we were both pleased with the food. Our server was bright, friendly, and attentive..my only complaint was the hostess. We waited standing there awkwardly to be acknowledged and there was no \"hey, sorry for the long wait...\" or any sort of politeness on her end both when we arrived and when we left. We felt a bit uncomfortable! Very family oriented so if you don't have kids  you may find the noise irritating."}
{"text":"The food is second only to our waitress Cathy. She was amazing, kind, quick and sweet. She made our experience perfect. Made excellent recommendations, and worked hard to make us happy. The overall environment was. Little loud for my taste but after all it was a tavern and very busy at almost anytime of day. But you have to stop in and at least order a pretzel. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"This was not our first visit to the Grumpy Troll. The service was good. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our appetizer, chips and salsa, and a flight of beer. The beer was excellent."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I discovered this place somehow by accident while biking and looking for a quick bite. Ever since then, I've become a fan. The service and their staff is great. This small restaurant/brewery has a unique character and their beer sampler is just a really fun past time. They have quite the large selection of beers that keep changing during for the season.Their food especially the beer battered fries are the best. I am a fan of their burger but I had other things on their menu as well and their are just great. The bathroom are clean and well cared. I love their merchandise that is offered, good price quality for their T-shirts, glasses and other things. This is one of the best spots in town and easy accessible by car and bicycle."}
{"text":"I love this place, really.  I make an annual trek to House on the Rock from Chicago and always stop here on my way home.   I've had some hits and some misses, but last time I went (3/29/08) the food was very good (a burger and soup--I'm a burger snob).  The beers are also good--though a designated driver is a must.  They lose a star for service. I've always had pretty bad service here... usually young girls who would be better off working at a Fridays or Dennys. Work on it! I'll be back next year and re-review."}
{"text":"Great service and food, we came hungry and were rewarded with 1/2 lb local meat burgers. Anything that they brew in house is amazing, especially the root beer. On the spendy side, but you do get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday drive and found this restaurant. It was a Sunday afternoon and they were so busy. We think there was a bike race or marathon in town. We waited at the bar 45 minutes to be seated. Were seated outside on the patio. The server was good and took our drink and food order quickly. The food was good. We order a burger and steak sandwich with fries. My husband loved his burger."}
{"text":"Party Foul.  Never have I ever experienced a more unfortunate series of events when it comes to service. In fact, even using the word 'unfortunate' is still being WAY too kind, 'FUBAR' is a whole lot closer to the type of service+management we experienced.  I'm going to start off with a mildly irrelevant tidbit and then move into the real nitty gritty of how Grumpy Troll turned my group grumpy. I know this is just a taste thing and not at all what I'm basing my review on, but I felt it was still worth mentioning that their bourbon barrel aged porter is a joke, also, more like a farmhouse sour than a porter. Defo NOT what you're expecting or wanting when you order a porter.  We dined with another couple in the upstairs pizzeria... I think going upstairs was not a great idea as it was empty, less one guy at the 'bar' and a staff that looked barely legal to be serving beer. For 2 couples, who ordered one round of beers and 2 pizzas, the number of mistakes made by the restaurant became almost comical until the bill came and we were still not appropriately compensated for the excessive amount of time wasted waiting for them to attempt to make our make our food correctly, which they still ended up not doing.   First mistake: The other couple ordered the large Thai Pie pizza, veggie style (no chicken, sub pineapple) and requested for one half of that to be made w/o cheese and noted that it was because one of the diners is lactose intolerant. When that pizza came, the server acknowledged that pizza had been made incorrectly, with only half being the veggie Thai Pie and the other half being only cheese, which obvi wouldn't work for the lactose intolerant diner. She said they were making her up a new smaller pizza that was the Thai Pie as she requested.   Second mistake: After looking closer at what was on the Thai Pie portion of the above pizza, they realized that they had also not gotten half the ingredients that were meant to come on the Thai Pie. No shredded carrots, no cilantro, nada. When we let the server know she brought it back to the kitchen area and had the kid toss some shredded carrots and cilantro on top.   Third mistake: Our pizza arrives well after the other couple's first pizza at the table had arrived (what was the hold up with ours? Can they not make 2 pizzas at once?). We had ordered the large Thai Pie as well, veggie style (no chicken, sub basil). The server dropped the pie off and swiftly left. As we looked at the pizza, we noticed that there was no basil and there was chicken. Since neither of us eat meat, this was obvi not going to fly. We had to AGAIN get up, find the server, tell here the issue and wait for her to come back for the old pizza. They said they'd make us up a correct one right away. Fine, no prob, I worked in restaurants for well over a decade, I've had sh*tty days and I know there are times when it seems like a chain of everyone is messing up one table's order.   Fourth mistake: Our pizza FINALLY comes, after he other couple is done with both their first and second round of incorrect pizzas and just waiting on us. We check out the pizza and not only did they bring us the small sized pizza, instead of the large that we had ordered, but there still was no basil, and they added pineapple. So apparently they remade the other couple's first half of the pizza they ordered. Whatever. Fuck it. We're all hungry, we have a long drive back, I'll pick the f*cking pineapple off the pizza. Another person at our table went to ask for a side of basil to add so at least we could have that, but it was still some kind of bullsh*t that they still could not manage to make a single pizza correctly, when there was only 1 table in there eating.   Fifth mistake: The manager came by and stood with her hands on her hips in a kind of 'Look guys, I don't know how we managed to f*ck this much ish up' type of manner. Everyone at the table had all or does still work or manage a restaurant so we understood and she just checked to see if everything \"at least tastes okay\" and said she'd take care of some of our bill, but when the bill came for the BF and I we were still charged the full price for our drinks and she had only mildly discounted the price of a large Thai Pie, when we still had only received a small one. So basically, she cut us a deal on *maybe* $3 after we had been sitting there getting the wrong sh*t for the past 2 hours, and then, to top it off, she blamed everything on the poor server girl. Using her name and saying she was new and making a face. As a former server, I thought this was totally inappropriate. For that many mistakes to happen it's not only the server, but the kitchen, and now, in my opinion, the manager's fault. If you have a server who is new and is clearly having an issue after 3 wrong pizzas come out, you obviously need to stand by and help them out instead of sitting back by the bar. Shame on you for throwing the server under the bus.   We won't be back. Never again."}
{"text":"7/2 I had a brochure which listed Mount Horeb as the \"Troll Capital of the World\" so I knew I had to see it.   The town is fun and charming and the Grumpy Troll fits in with that perfectly.  It was packed with a long waiting list at 4pm on a Saturday so we played checkers while we waited.    The wait didn't end up being very long and we were seated in the rear dining area.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers.  We started with the Uff-da Pretzel which was delicious but also humongous!  It comes with cheese and two different kinds of mustard - one has a huge dollop of horseradish.  I understand the title of \"uff-da\" now; it kind of takes your breath away.  The \"Maggie\" beer is a great IPA and the root beer is tasty, too.  I got the Three Lil Pigs sandwich which was pulled pork, ham and cheese, and bacon all in one fantastic sandwich.   The seasoned waffle fries are delicious.  My husband ordered a Grevling burger which came with a brat and sauerkraut on top.  Great food!  It's a little dark in the restaurant, but it's clean and our server was very friendly.  We took a growler of Maggie to go and set out to find more trolls in town (they're very elusive, these trolls!)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were en route to House on the Rock when we came across a sign advertising for this place. She is all about trolls, that's probably why she is into me, and that was enough to check this place out after the sober psychedelic trip of the House on the Rock. Let me just say that the drive through Mount Horeb was unique and special. The nitty gritty is that the food and beer were very good. The only thing that I thought was weird was that if you wanted a pizza you had to go upstairs. You see, I was very hungry and the lady doesn't want pizza. We get a table on the lower level and are told that they only serve the pizza upstairs!?! I wanted a pizza and didn't want to wait just to go upstairs. Heck, I would even grab the pizza and carry it downstairs myself as they stated that was the issue as pizzas can fall. I ate french fries as Lady Streets Ahead finished her meal. Then it was time to go upstairs. The whole experience was worth the detour but the aforementioned pizza situation was bizarre."}
{"text":"I found the food and brew nothing to write home about...just your typical pub fare.  We ordered the Grump Chips...they were mediocre but the Gorgonzola sauce accompanying them was very good.  The seasoning on the chips tasted like tacos and the Parmesan cheese topping was cooked to a crisp.  My lunch companion ordered a burger which she seemed to enjoy.  I had a dinner salad which was fresh and tasty, a half sandwich of turkey and cheddar on marbled rye (the thinly sliced turkey was grilled before assembling the sandwich, which made the entire offering dry), and a cup of the beer cheese soup, which I found just so-so (it had a bitter bite to it, probably from the beer used). Our server Anessa was very personable and helpful when she was present, but was conspicuously absent most the time.  However, it was rather busy.  The kitchen must have been a bit overwhelmed as our food was slow in arriving."}
{"text":"I think this place is mostly hype. The bar is really small. There is some strange rule about ordering pizza upstairs but not downstairs. Full menu downstairs and not upstairs? I don't get it. Separate owners? No clue but get it together. Give customers what they want. We would have spent a lot more money here!  The food we were allowed to order was only decent. I had the vegetarian chili which only had 1 type of bean. It wasn't even chili really. More like a cup of black beans. My salad was pretty crappy.   Other people were not overly thrilled with the sandwiches either. Maybe we should have walked upstairs and did pizza. The service is friendly. The beer is just ok. The bloody mary is SPICY! Even if you love spice! Just be warned."}
{"text":"We have been here several times before and have always enjoyed it. The food has always been good.  The burgers taste like they just came off the charcoal grill.  The fish tacos are good.  They are very accommodating and will make the item to your liking.  When they are busy the service is a little slow.  It is a bit noisy especially if there are young children screaming.  The beer selection is fantastic and the wait-persons can explain the nuances of all."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have always had great service and good food. Well on 3/26 we stopped again for dinner, this time not only was service great but I had the BEST prime rib sandwich in my life. The meat was unreal,and the mix of bacon/veggie and horseradish was unreal. If ya stop in you gotta give it a try!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and I had spent the afternoon at Blue Mounds State Park and decided to stop here for dinner.  This was my second visit with similar results.  I thought service and food were perfectly fine.  We had sweet potato tots, which were decent.  Mainly because they were different than the usual tots.  We also had chicken enchilada soup (good), side salad (really good), and a cheese burger (OK).  As someone else had previously mentioned, the burger was very well done, although we ordered it with a little pink, it was pretty much gray.  We had about a 35 minute wait as it was pretty busy.  I'd happily go there again, but might opt to try the pizza next time for something different."}
{"text":"Great microbrew beers and food. The fried Mac and cheese appetizer was so cheesy and delicious. Had the fish and chips while my friend had the burger. The Grumpy Troll potato side was cheesy and yummy as well."}
{"text":"One word... EPIC!  My brother and I talked to a local during the Kettle Moraine 100 Mile Endurance Run about places to go near Madison. He couldn't recommend this place more and wrong he was not. We got excited to try it because we love little craft breweries. The place had a great atmosphere, fast, courteous staff, and EPIC food and beer. We had the cheese curds, which were a new experience for an AZ desert rat like me. The giant pretzel was amazing. The brat was well cooked and came in a pretzel bun (try the mustards). The beer topped off a great meal and experience! We bought t-shirts on the way out and are now members of \"Team Grumpy\".  Ask your server about the Trollway and the restaurant's name."}
{"text":"Who would of thunk it, a brewery in Mount Horeb. I wouldn't of been in Mount Horeb if it wasn't for the mustard museum. Speaking of mustard, Grumpy Troll serves mustard from the mustard museum with their food.   Ok the beer, that was the reason I was at grumpy troll and I am happy to report that it was some very tasty brew. The beer flight offered 8 tasty samples... 8 thats a pretty pretty pretty good deal! I think my favorite was the ''Red Eyed Troll.'  Lots of seating and great service."}
{"text":"I was visiting my great aunt for the week in Madison and we stopped in here for a bite to eat. I had the grumpy troll burger, and thought it was excellent. The fries that I had on the side were tasty too!  I had to try one of their beers, so I ordered their Belgium Style Session and their Wheat hefe. The Belgium style session was refreshing, with a hint of honey at the end. The Wheat was reminiscent of most Hefe's, and done very well. I had to purchase a beer glass for a souvenir, only wish it was cheaper than the 6 dollars I paid for it. All in all, the service and food were excellent and I would recommend going there to anyone that's in the area."}
{"text":"I love the Grumpy Troll! I've been a fan since I began eating here and love the new additions they have made this summer. I change my food order frequently when ordering at the Grumpy Troll and have not been disappointed. I also love the spicy Bloody Mary and their wheat beer! I personally think this cute little restaurant and brewery just keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"On occasion I need to come out to the grumpy for a fantastic pretzel! The food rocks but the huge pretzel and sauces is the bomb. Small town feel great beer"}
{"text":"The bar was full when we asked for a booth she told us if we weren't eating she wouldn't seat us we came here for food and drinks we  tried to order our drinks they had neither of what we wanted  so we compromised and got something else. We ordered a large pretzel for the two of us and she asked what else are you ordering for food  and she was very snotty about it like that wasn't enough to take one of her precious booths up. 4 stars for big pretzel. 0 stars for alcohol selection. 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"Good food and beer but shitty service! Bartender looked at my empty glass 4 times in 5 minutes and didn't bother offering me another one till I finally said something!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun place to visit!!  I really enjoyed it. We stopped by for a work lunch on the way back from a trip. The portions were huge!!! The food tasted great. We over ordered for sure so we could taste everything. I can't want to taste the beer sometime. We were seated immediately. Parking wasn't easy and had to park 3 blocks away."}
{"text":"We visited the Grumpy Troll Pub & Brewery recently while in Mt. Horeb for a St. Patrick's Day event.  This was my second visit there.  Our waitress, Taylor, was awesome.  She seemed to be very busy, but was all smiles for me and my family and provided great service.  The food was great, I had the Three Lil' Pigs, which is BBQ pork topped with locally made bacon along with Applewood-smoked ham and cheddar.  I ordered 2 separate 3 glass flights of the different beers, so I could try as many as I could without getting too trashed.  My favorite was Erik The Red, hoppy but it had a good flavor.  Again, the service, food and beer were wonderful, so if you are ever in the Mt. Horeb area, check out the Grumpy Troll."}
{"text":"Great place.  Stopped by on a Saturday lunch hour and the place was slammed. Still they got us in quick.  Walleye sandwich is excellent. Burgers are great too. Beer selection great.  You won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based upon reviews that we seen on yelp it was a cool looking place when we got inside we were seated right away however our service was very poor it took us 15 minutes for anyone to approach our table and ask us for a drink order then It took another 15 minutes for them to come back and ask if we wanted any appetizers we ordered our main dish with her appetizers if you did come out quickly but the service while we had the food was still very poor we noticed other tables that we're getting better service so I think it was this the matter of one poor staff member.    The big pretzel was a very good appetizer as well as a sweet potato tater tot's I ordered a Reuben and only had three slices of corn beef on it the other dishes that our family had was just fine the beer was also good overall that's why only give it two stars was the poor Ruben and very poor service"}
{"text":"Memorable for the wrong reasons. I ordered a bowl of seafood chowder and a side salad with raspberry vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was extremely sweet - basically raspberry sauce on an OK mixed greens salad.  The seafood chowder was very thin and had a decent overall flavor. However the amount of salt in the soup was at least 3x the necessary amount. It was so salty that I only finished it due to hunger.  The cornbread muffin that accompanied the dish was incredibly underbaked. I don't understand how you can screw up a cornbread muffin. Half of it was inedible because half of it was raw dough.   The only reason this gets 2 stars was the service. The waitress was very sweet and efficient. Otherwise, would never come back."}
{"text":"We live near Mount Horeb, so I'd say we stop at the Grumpy somewhat regularly. It's a go-to when friends or family are in town and want to go out without having to run into Madison. The food is good, although my primary gripe is that the menu doesn't change at all. I wouldn't complain if they added at least a small seasonal or rotating section. They have good burgers, but some of the rest is lacking.   Some of the Grumpy's beers and drinks do change, and I'm a  fan of their hot winter drinks. They also make a very tasty root beer. I'm not a fan of beer to begin with, but one of my housemates loves their dark beers. I tried a flight once and only liked their wheat. Their fried green beans are one of my favorite appetizers anywhere - we've even recreated them at home.   The pizza is tasty, but nothing too special, and the pizzeria is more family friendly than the brew-pub area. Both sections can get VERY loud at times. I'm sad to say that they also don't have many options for vegetarians.  I haven't witnessed any of the server complaints others have posted here. We've had groups of two, four, six and twelve without problem. There are times when they are very busy, but that's pretty obvious when you get there and I'm not going to get upset over a little bit of a wait if that's the case. You should call ahead if you have a larger group, they do take reservations. Overall, this is a good brew-pub but I think there are others in the area which are better."}
{"text":"Must have: 3 little pigs sandwich. Pork, ham and bacon! Nice atmosphere and good brews too. I liked the trailside wheat."}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers below, I stopped here on a whim while passing through (on a self guided southern Wisconsin wide brewery tour). My bf and I browsed the lunch menu and decided on the 1/2 salad and a cup of soup deal with one of their beers to wash it down.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the menu more carefully and what should have been a $20 lunch turned into $40 because the salads listed below that deal were not actually included in that deal, only a small house salad. It was too late though, we had both already devoured our soups (the super delicious chicken enchilada soup) and salads (mine was the ensalada fiesta, his was the chicken gorgonzola salad). Either way, for two cups of soup, two salads, and two beers, I would not expect a $40 bill in rural Wisconsin. GIVE ME A BREAK. If not for the unreasonably steep prices, I'd have given this place four stars. The food was pretty good, the beer was different and tasty, and the server was really nice even with the misunderstanding."}
{"text":"Call me a grump, but I find absolutely no reason to return. Our waitress was lovely, which is why I'm not giving the place one star, but all the smiles in the world wouldn't make up for the crummy experience.   Their beer is downright awful. The spectrum of offerings runs from flat and lifeless to bitter and tar-like. I went with a group of four and between us we tried 8 different drafts. There wasn't a single one we liked, nor a single one we finished. I realize this is personal preference, you might like their beer, but you'd be wrong. (I kid, I kid... go and try them, you might decide I'm crazy, but there's much better beer brewed in the state.)  The food didn't fare much better. I was excited to see they use Black Earth Meats, but holy cats... they cooked my burger to death, they should have just used some crappy ground from a food service provider. The hockey puck of a patty was so dry, so flavorless, I almost wanted to write Black Earth Meats to tell them Grumpy Troll is abusing their beef. So sad. Fries weren't much better. Cold and soggy.   Heads up, the hostess station is in a weird location, so when you arrive, you aren't really met by anyone. You need to walk around the bar to get to her, THEN you need to go up there to pay at the end of your meal. I realize this is a tiny little thing, I probably sound whiny mentioning it, but I'm not certain why you can't settle up with your waitress? It's very \"Perkin's\" feeling to me.   Last up, the fact that you can't order pizza downstairs and you can't get a burger upstairs is downright silly. People have mentioned it in reviews before and I'm bringing it up again. How hard is it to walk a pizza downstairs if that's where someone wants to sit because there are booths open. Alternatively if you can only host a party of 12 upstairs where there's more open seating, and if they want burgers or other items from the menu downstairs, grab all your servers and run food up at once. I'm no restaurant owner but this simply doesn't make sense to me. It's one building. If I did own a restaurant and this restaurant was multiple floors, I'd let you eat whatever the heck you wanted wherever you wanted.   I realize there's not much in Mt. Horeb, but that's no excuse in my opinion for sub-par beer, a burger that's overcooked although I ordered it medium, and odd restaurant practices that just don't make sense."}
{"text":"Get the Monk beer while you can; put on tap Thursday; seasonal only. High ABV, low IBU and tastes great too! A full pint for only $5.50 Sorry we live so far away  Couple with the Reuben and house made chips; you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Beer was good as usual...but the burgers were much to be desired.  My son's burger was black charred.  He asked for medium.  Mine was medium and I asked for medium rare.  I have never been impressed with the food or service.  I'll stick to their beer from now on."}
{"text":"Nice large pub/restaurant?. Pretty busy even at 3:30pm on Sunday . Had popcorn shrimp which was good. Tiny shrimp / nice & crispy. Had walleye sandwich with waffle fries and garden wrap with sweet potato tots. Food tasted pretty standard.   Ambience was chill. I would come again."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxing atmosphere, and amazing service.  If you're in the area you have to stop here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night for a going-away party for one of her coworkers and the experience was largely positive but the food was mixed, but the service was very good. On this visit I can only speak to the pizzeria as we did not go into the main dining area.  I had a Pizza Roll-Up done in the style of BBQ chicken. The crust was flavorful and crisp, I loved it. They don't skimp on the ingredients, either. The cheese that leaked out got a little seared which some folks might not enjoy but I actually like. All in all that was great. I'd get it again in a heart beat.   My wife, however, obtained the penne pasta bake. Again -- they did not skimp on the ingredients and the meatballs were good, especially with the cheese, but ultimately the sauce was bland -- it needed several notches more *something* to get it to where it needed to be. The pasta was also overcooked and I think this is in large part because they weren't subtle with the sauce so when it baked the pasta cooked even more. It wasn't a \"one star\" dish but that's only because the meatballs and garlic bread saved it from the abyss.  The Pizza Roll-Up, however, has me inclined not to write them off. If we come back to the area a repeat visit will definitely be in the realm of possibility."}
{"text":"Food was below average.  Service was nice when present.  My burger was burnt and tasted like char.  Cheese curds were ok.  Just nothing stood out.  I toyed with a 2-star but ultimately there are many, many other places I would try or go back to before giving The Grumpy Troll another shot."}
{"text":"We've been here many time and always enjoy good beer and good food.   Today I had the Ryebernator which was very good, a lot going for a rye ale with honey. For a 2nd beer I had a very good stout, the spatnetz. My wife I had the How Now Brown Cow which is right up her alley and she enjoyed very much.  For food I had the beer cheese soup, much better than most I've had. And the walleye sandwich which was excellent. My wife had a chicken sandwich with lettuce wrap, the lettuce was a bit wilted and wouldn't work as a wrap, she used a knife and fork, but the taste was good.  Friendly staff, as always, but you should know this isn't fast, if you go, plan to take your time. Overall, a good choice for a relaxed weekend lunch. We'll be back many more times, I'm certain."}
{"text":"Quality of food has gone down hill.  The prices are ridiculous for the quality!  Waitress rushed us, rolled her eyes, and was unfriendly overall.  Too many other good restaurants to waste time here.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"This could easily be 5 stars (or three, even).  For now, we'll stick with 4 stars.  I was at Grumpy Troll for a happy hour gathering for a departing coworker.  I started with a scotch ale (my favorite).  It was excellent.  There are other scotch ales I like more, but don't get me wrong, this one is worth it.  We ordered some appetizers while we carried on.  Those came and looked great.  The large pretzel (platter-sized - amazingly huge) was impressive.  That was followed by chicken drummies and onion rings.  All of the appetizers were really good.  It would have been great to try them ALL, but we showed restraint.    Some of the guys ordered dinner.  I was leaving soon, so I passed on the larger meal.  I was sad as their food arrived and looked amazing.  The burgers were big and the smells were amazing.  The french dip made me drool - that's a family favorite...  Business picked up as folks got out of work.  I suspect it was busy for a reason!  The Grumpy Troll has moved into the short list of \"places we need to go to soon\".  I'm quite sure my wife will love the french dip.  I'll probably have that too.  I'll bump to 5 stars if the food knocks it out of the park.  If it just looks good, but \"meh\", I'll drop a star.  For now, it's an easy 4..."}
{"text":"After visiting the Shoe Box in Black Earth, we continued on to Mt. Horeb for  a quick bite to eat. The people at this restaurant were fabulous! It was crowded, but we got our food and drinks relatively quick, and we thought everything was fairly good.   I don't necessarily recommend the food, it's just standard pub fare, but the Pretzel and the Beer I do recommend!"}
{"text":"Gotta say the food as well as the service were great. Also both the red and dark beer choices were good."}
{"text":"Beer and Trolls! Huh?  Seriously though, delicious beer. I took a growler of the Maggie IPA to-go. The food was decent, but thankfully we'd just been down the street to the Mustard Museum and had some amazing pretzels and mustard to snack on with the beers. I love the woodwork on the sign out front too.   If you're in the Troll Capital of the World, make sure to stop by this gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the gems that makes Wisconsin so great. It was a fun and welcoming place with excellent food. The burgers and brat were all really really good and we can't wait until we are in the area to eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food and pretty good beer. Cheese curds and prime rib is the dinner of champions."}
{"text":"Decent food, very good beer. Not much better in town and the beer is worth going for by itself.  I prefer the pizza upstairs to their regular food in the dining room.  That stuff is the same as any other bar in town."}
{"text":"After a 15 mile bike ride from Verona to Mt. Horeb, my friends and I were tired, hungry, and excited to finally have arrived for a meal at Grumpy Troll, a place we've heard so much about!  The restaurant itself is very nice-clean, pretty bar...and an endearing troll obsession.   Our first disappointment was that they have a pizzeria and a brewery on different floors and you CANNOT order a pizza if you're at the restaurant....I find this quite rigid and odd.  What's the big deal to carry a pizza up the stairs?  Oh well.    Our waitress, Dawn, was initially perfectly nice and asked us what we wanted to start with.  We asked her to give us a minute because we weren't quite sure yet.  After enough time to go through the menu three times and change our mind a couple of times, I finally got up to ask the hostess to find our waitress.  Dawn came back and was quite the grumpy troll.  I said we were ready to order both our drinks and our food, she snapped that she had a seven top whose food was ready and it was going to get cold.  Err...ok lady....a quick, even insincere apology would have been fine.  We don't need to know what is going on at other tables.   I've been a waitress in many establishments and I know a quick apology can go a long way.  As time went on she was fine and as she gave us the bill,  she apologized for being slow to get our order.  At that point we didn't want to hear it.       As far as the food, my salmon salad was really very good but overloaded with cranberries. I'm not a cranberry fan and therefore picked them out of my salad- there were literally 8,000 dried cranberries. Why so many?  My husband was very satisfied with his burger and our friends reported that their meals left them something to be desired......everyone except my husband was still hungry when finished."}
{"text":"There's a reason that it's so busy: the burgers and beers are amazing. The wait is a bit annoying but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way towards the Mississippi River for a camping trip. Bryan and I are always looking for breweries whilst road-tripping, so when we saw signs for The Grumpy Troll it was time to pull over for a couple of beers and some dinner. Our waitress was great, and brought us beer samples to try as we perused the menu. She was even patient when I asked what was up with all of the trolls in town.   To be honest, I was about to google their menu because I completely forgot which beers we had. I guess that kind of speaks to their memorability...I wasn't blown away, but it was cold beer so I drank it. Dinner was great though. I enjoyed the best fried walleye sandwich I've ever tasted, served on a deliciously soft hoagie roll with tartar sauce and LTO. Alongside the sandwich I ordered the beer battered fries, which were perfectly crispy and satisfying. Bryan had a reuben which ended up being average when stacked up against others we've had.  The hostess stand is located in the back of the restaurant, which I could see being an issue when the restaurant gets busy. Due to this, the dining room had so many signs explaining where to go that I was waiting for someone to tell me to grab a rope and hold on tight as I walked to my table. It took away from the ambiance a little bit, but I just decided to focus on the troll dolls staring at me from above the bar. Overall, Grumpy Troll is probably one of the best places to stop if you're in the area and looking for something that isn't a chain. I enjoyed my experience and the town of Mt. Horeb looks like it's worth a walkthrough too."}
{"text":"Decent food good beer and fast thoughtful service. Super loud on a busy Friday night.  If you have people in your party who are sensitive to sound don't come here during busy times."}
{"text":"My fellah and I are up in these parts on our mini vacation and were recommended here by a nice gal at the Cave of the Mounds. Always ask the locals where to eat. You almost can't fail unless you're someplace they hate tourists.   Ordered the beer sampler, 12 four ounce glasses of beer. Aw yeah.  Get the bourbon barrel stout. Omgawd so good! The Belgian style IPA (you heard me right) is also yummy as hell.   Anyway, we both ordered burgers, he the Grumpy burger, I the make your own.  They both came out grilled perfectly medium with all our trimmings fresh and delicious. I got grilled onions, pineapple and avocado (I also like calamari on my bratwurst, what?) and everything came out perfect.  Also? Sweet potato tots. FTW, y'all.  Every tot should be made of sweet potatoes.   Our food  came out lickity split, our waitress was such a doll I tipped her more than my standard 20%, and the brewmaster came and chatted for a minute and told us his favorites. In all fairness I did tell him I loved him after tasting the bourbon barrel stout, which may have prompted him to come and chat.   I see this place has mixed as hell reviews, but our experience here was awesome and we'll happily go back when we're in these parts."}
{"text":"Samples are only $1.50 each.  I tried 5 of them and they were all delicious.  I had two porters and three IPAs and they were delicious.  I also tried a taste of the Sunflower that was too light and sweet for my taste. I had the Three Little Piggies sandwich and I had to take half of it home with me. Service was good.  Prices were fair and the beer was great."}
{"text":"Very nice local restaurant and brewery right in downtown Mt. Horeb. We come here almost every time when in town. Service is always friendly, we've sat at the bar as well at tables. Their beer is delicious and food is decent for your average American fare. Nice waiters but it usually takes long for food and aquire your check. You can also sit outside and they serve pizza upstairs, however we've never been up there.  You should definitely check this place out if your in Mt Horeb even if just to grab a beer while your exploring the downtown area."}
{"text":"Yeah, man! This place has everything; the vibe, the food and the brews! We stopped in on a drizzly Saturday looking for a warm up and bump. The featured soup was seafood chowder and it was delish! My husband, who is not a soup enthusiast, loved it! The service was very attentive, a trick given how crowded it became while we were there. I swear, I think we chatted with half of the restaurant visitors. Everyone was friendly and had a great time; good beer does that. ;^)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops on the way to Platteville.  We stumbled across The Grumpy Troll while visiting the Mustard Museum.  Our experience has always been good.  The beer is great.  The food always hot and flavorful.  The service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The pros: Interesting atmosphere and inclusion of creepy trolls. The service was pretty good, not very engaging, but prompt and they were busy so maybe it would have been more personable on a slower afternoon. There was a regular there that seemed to have his own mug, everyone knew him, and he seemed content so...that's good. The beers were quite good. the sour was not as complex as I would have liked and the anniversary brew was missing a bit on the hops, but very drinkable. The giant pretzel was more than enough of a meal for me and my wife. The only ding, and only reason for it not being five stars, is that the pizzeria for some reason is only upstairs and the first floor does not have the option to order from it. Odd choice in my opinion, seeing as how I have been to several pizzerias that have more than one floor."}
{"text":"Very confused meal. Some very good and some not so good. I'm giving it 2 stars because at the end of the meal when I looked at my check I was actually charged .25 for a side of mayo. Go figure. The appetizers are delightful. The cheese curds and enormous pretzel simply a treat you need to try. Green beans were fine. The locally brewed root beer is excellent and offers free refills and I recommend. I had the BLT which they over sold on the menu description. Three pieces of bacon on a $10 or so BLT sandwich doesn't cut it.  I specifically asked and was told it was great. Quite frankly, Arby's has an excellent BLT with twice the bacon at half the price. Add it all up and a sold 3 star or light 4 becomes a 2 star when they charge you for mayonnaise. It's an unforgivable charge on a full service restaurant check. We spent $140 for lunch for 8. Just my opinion, agree or not."}
{"text":"Overall it's a good place to grab some food.  The appetizers are spot on, the giant pretzel is delicious and the entrees are average. I had the beer brat and sweet potato tots. Beer brat was good just very simple and the pretzel bun wasn't even as good as the pretzel appetizer. The sweet potato tots were good. The wait was ridiculous on a Saturday afternoon. But the wait staff was very nice."}
{"text":"There's a lot of love put into this place. Friendly atmosphere that is accommodating for children. Great beer  and a good selection of other drinks. The quality and selection of food is much better than most bar and grill food. The Grumpy Troll is worth going out of your way to get to."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to go to Blue Mound State Park on Saturday and hit up the Grumpy Troll on the way home.  Mt. Horeb is a charming little town with a small downtown area.  It's hard not to find the Grumpy Troll, which seems to be the main gathering spot in Mt. Horeb.  The Pizzeria located upstairs had a wait time and the pub downstairs was teeming with life.  The beer is mediocre; of the 8 that I tried, I really only enjoyed 3.  The service, atmosphere, and food were all great, however.  It's definitely worth the stop, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and the curds were solid too.  Bit pricey but overall a solid all around experience."}
{"text":"The place can get pretty crowded and it could be a long wait for a table. We prefer the bar area. Seem to get better service from the bartender.The pretzel is beyond huge and filling. The beer cheese soup and chicken salad are excellent. Not a huge fan of the beers, myself. I stick to the Bloody Marys."}
{"text":"It's not my first Grumpy Troll visit, so I knew it was good stuff.  I opened the menu and found the offer for a tshirt and beer for $10.  Heck, I can't buy a beer or a tshirt for $10 at some places and the sunflower was cute.  It came with the sunflower ale beer which was lighter for an ale and while not quite citrusy, had a good flavor.  The grumpy chops were crunchy and had a good Gonzalo cheese dipping sauce which was excellent and I missed half of it while I was too busy Yelping to eat.    We went on a Friday, so even though the menu looked great-I needed a good Wisconsin fish fry and the Grumpy Troll did not disappoint me.  The fried cods came in almost a tube shape which made dipping in the tarter sauce perfect, the coleslaw had a good creamy flavor, neither too sweet or too bland.  The waffle fries were fine.  They were crispy and very lightly seasoned, but the rest of my food was excellent enough that I didn't care if I skipped some.    The service was great.  When you walk in the front door you do need to weave past the bar through the restaurant to get to the hostess table, but she also processes transactions and shows off fun collectible tshirts, pint glasses and bumper stickers.  (FYI we have a Grumpy Troll pint glass a few years old that hasn't faded and is still serving us drinks quite often in rotation.  Mine does go through the dishwasher too).  So if you're strolling the Main Street of Mt Horeb or just looking for a fun place check it out.  Most items are approximately $10 which makes good pretty affordable."}
{"text":"I was torn between two soups, and the awesome server resolved my dilemma by giving me two for the price of one!  Both were excellent.  Sandwiches were great.    We really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ohmygod. Their waitresses always seem like they hate their lives and the food is always average.  Beers nice though ;)"}
