{"text":"i was craving sashimi so bad and one day, my mom and I were in town so we decided to just go grab sushi there. Its a small place (3tables) but its cozy :3 the staff are nice and their sushi are fresh. we took a salmon tartare, spicy salmon rolls and an other one with tempura and they were all very good. not much variety, the pricing is fair! But i think its the type of place to grab takeout rather than sit."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I get the veg tempura roll every time. Super fresh and fast. Place is small so be sure to arrive early for lunch. A bit over priced, though it is worth it."}
{"text":"Good affordable takeout sushi. Their avocado maki is better than most other places I've tried."}
{"text":"Nippon is a great place to grab some quick sushi.  You can either pick up already rolled sushi (which I never get), or order what you want and it is made fresh in front of you.  The choices are pretty decent for the size of the place.  I normally grab a couple rolls of maki to go after a nice workout at my gym nearby.  They are very fast and the sushi is definitely good.  It is a bit more pricey than the other quick sushi shops, but it is definitely worth the slight increase in price."}
{"text":"Great take-out Sushi on the go.  Nippon Sushi is not the kind of place you'd take someone to on a date or any other intimate occasion. Rather, it's more of a humble take-out counter that just happens to have a few tables for the lunch crowd and weekend shoppers.  That being said, the sushi is certainly above average quality for take-out, lunch-rush sushi. The service is also quick, and the prices are reasonable. Definitely worth a stop if you're running around downtown, and only have half an hour or so to grab a quick, healthy bite."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer since 2007 and have nothing negative to say about this place. They probably desserve the title of serving the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"I've been going there for lunch or a few month because I work nearby.  The food is fresh and tasty. Price is quite reasonable.  It's my new benchmark for sushi places."}
{"text":"That's my goto sushi place in Montreal. I find the ingredients (incl. rice, fish, veggies, etc.) are consistently fresher than most places, yet prices are not much higher.  There's lots of great rolls, but the seaweed salad is particularly interesting and something you don't usually have at other places. Those and/or the miso soups is usually what I have."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite when we were wandering around downtown. They have a pretty good selection. We got three rolls and all of them were good. Not a bad lunch option. It's a small space but the staff is friendly and the big window in front makes for good people watching."}
{"text":"Update because one year later, i am still visiting Nippon every week. The staff is so so nice and the salmon is FRESH. If you want amazing sushi (nigiri& sashimi is definitely better than their rolls so you can get the full flavour of the fish), visit this small shop and order at the counter!!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years! Can you believe I have worked right next door, taken out, eaten in and NEVER knew the name of this place! LOL A great place to just pick up some good sushi and soup for a quick lunch. I would order the 5 piece shrimp tempura sushi almost everyday at one point. Convenient, clean, and friendly and sooo much better than that fast food, cold, tasteless Sushi Shop.  Much recommended. Go and try it out yourselves!"}
{"text":"Because everyday is sushi day, I had bookmarked this place and wanted to try what most reviews said was pretty good sushi.  The good is that the prices are very decent for Montreal since most futomaki rolls are in the $7 range. Their Nigiri selection is more than decent so one could get a nice plate for about $20.  The bad is that the sushi just \"delivers\"  but is not amazing. The rolls are standard size for Montreal (meaning small) and the rice in the tuna Nigiri was not the best.  I will definitely try them again as they're very convenient but another minus is they don't seem to have a set-piece menu so everything is a la carte."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and really enjoyed it. The fish was good and the prices were cheap. I went with a friend and we both enjoyed our meals. I would recommend it. The place is tiny, so it may be hard to get a seat during busy hours."}
{"text":"Location: Heart of downtown on de Maisonneuve, corner Peel.  Noms: Definitely my go-to place when I'm in the mood for lunchtime sushi. Personally, I think it's better than Sushi Shop and other 'fast sushi' places in the area. They have a pretty good selection - you can either order a la carte or get one of their ready-made boxes. Every time I stop in they've either restocked the fridge or are in the process of doing just that so you know they've got a pretty good roll-out. Very fresh, too.  Price: Works for me. They're pretty affordable but of course, it depends on how much you're eating. I usually get a box that includes a variety of sushi + one specialty roll, for exactly $19.90.   It's very small but if you go around 11:30-11:45 you can usually get a table."}
{"text":"Nice small place. Most bento sushi boxes sold out in the dinner. Ok sushi with expensive price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Reasonably priced. I took a salad with their home-made dressing, and Mango salmon sushi. Very good! Opens 11am- 8pm weekdays, Closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is legit. The young fellow working there knows how to make some good sushi. Fresh fish, good combo of ingredients. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I go there for lunch quite a bit and it's a solid take out sushi place. It's not particularly creative or exciting by any means but if you just want a few sushi for lunch it's good. It's a bit pricey considering that you got only the normal sushi that you'd expect - tuna, salmon and avocado - but it's consistent and a convenient location."}
{"text":"For all the bad or extremely over-priced sushi in Montreal, it is pretty good. Fresh and satisfying for someone who wants basic/standard sushi rolls. I'm pretty critical of sushi so this place met my expectations for being somewhere i would recommend as a decent/reliable sushi spot without spending as much as the fine/specialty places. Pretty cute inside too."}
{"text":"quick place to stop and fill up better than going to Sushi shop good soup very basic rolls"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this quiet gem of a Sushi place any stronger. If you're walking by, you owe it to yourself to stop in and have the very friendly chefs prepare you one of their Black Dragon, Mango Male, or Salmon Tartar Maki rolls. Lovely little Sushi place, super tasty and also relatively wallet-friendly."}
{"text":"La nourriture était très ordinaire. Je ne m'attendais pas à du gros luxe, mais quand même. Les crevettes tempura donnait l'impression  d'avoir été chauffées au micro-onde, les sushis étaient un peu flasques et à la fin du repas mon estomac manifestait (probablement contre la fraîcheur des aliments). À éviter si possible, mais vous n'en mourrez pas."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews i decided to go give this place a try. To be totally honest I wasn't impressed! At all. Maybe it was the wrong time during the day. Maybe I'm too picky but I would of preferred going to a sushi food chain. The salmon's freshness was questionnable and the other maki's were tasteless. The tempura in on of the maki was chewy and very oily. Not light and crispy like one would expect. The cucumber was soft. The only reason why I give it an extra star is because the rice was well cooked. This place made me kinda regret having a sushi craving today :/"}
