{"text":"We decided to grab something quick here before heading to the theatres next door.   Although most of the stores in the mall are closed at around 6pm  the food court in First Markham Place stays open late until 10pm.   So we split a Satay Beef with flat rice noodle dish. Being aware that this is a fast food place where there's little care in preparation, we specially requested if they can use less oil and Satay sauce.   The person taking the order said that the ho fan noodle is already oily.  Huh? Well our request didn't make it to the chef our dish was super oily and saucy. Unimpressed even for food court standards.  Cost was $5.75+ tax   The drink accompanying the dish was a nice cool refreshing soy drink but sadly it was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Definitely a review that's been sitting in the works! This had been my go to Chinese food (beef friend rice) place as a child. Absolutely loved it and wouldn't take any substitutes, I recognize that their food was nothing special but something about having the double space gave them some cred in my young mind.   It's been a while since I've gotten Chinese fast food, but here is a place that you can't go wrong for the price point! $5.25 for a large meal - definite hit =)"}
{"text":"I really like their lamb brisket soup noodle. I drove two hours to here just for their lamb brisket. The lamb brisket are soft and tasty. They only accept cash which is a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"Food court food, quick, cheap. Good small dishes that they sell on the side window.  If you are in a rush and looking for cheap and quick food, this is the place to go.  Quality is good."}
{"text":"Went today and I thought they raised the price but they just charged me too little last time. Last time it was $7 for Cantonese chow mien   $7.50 for Cantonese chow mien this time, they filled the noodles to the top and loaded it with more toppings than most restaurants that charge way more! They might have charged me less because they didn't have the bbq pork. Must have ran out and charged less because of it"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and always ordered something different and to my surprise they always taste so good. No matter what you order it is really above fast food expectations as well as being cheap and with big portions. I really love their meat and tofu rice and their crispy chicken."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Yan's Cook, but now it's called Yan Can Cook (maybe Yan's Cook taught Yan how to cook, so now Yan can cook, haha).  The menu is the same and the staff I think are the same, so I think it was just a name change.  Anyway, it's one of the places to eat at the First Markham Place food court.  It's pretty cheap and the portions are large.  They are also really really fast.  You get a free iced tea with each plate.  I've had the Cantonese Chow Mein there ($7.50) and the portion is huge and full of meat and vegetables (BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp, squid, carrots, broccoli and shiitake mushrooms).  The noodles are deep fried, so they are really crispy.  My only complaint is that some parts were really salty and some parts were \"normal\" - although still verging on the too salty side.  They just need to be more even-handed with the salt (and they can afford be to more light-handed with the salt too).  Overall though a good cheap meal that will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"My go to place to eat at first Markham place. Reasonable price, good portion size and super fast. Food is always good and consistent"}
{"text":"Although this might not be Martin or cousin Stephen Yan's (both stars of their own cooking shows \"Yan Can Cook\" and  the Canadian version \"Wok with Yan\" respectively) quality of restaurant, it is fast food after all.    For under 6 bucks, it's a decent deal.  The crispy chicken dish was on par with some of the better places I've been (see my pic).  Had a decent serving of veg and the combo with the hot and sour soup.  As long as you stay away from the battered deep fried meat with gloopy sauce (i.e. fake chinese food), I think you'll be okay.  My buddies curried brisket was decent, and I've had the soup noodles with brisket which was right on par with any other congee type place.  Love being to get some decent Chrysanthemum tea that's not from a box or can, as you can't get it brewed everywhere (though admittedly it's probably instant).  It's one of the busier stalls at First Markham place food court, so get here before the noon rush."}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. It is a staple in the First Markham Place Food Court. It's right in the middle and probably one of the bigger stands in the food court. The whole food court is busy during lunch hour but I see a little line form in front of Yan's more so than other stands.   I always get their Shrimp Siu Mai which is 5 pieces for $3 flat no tax which you really cannot beat. They are big pieces too! 5 pieces is honestly enough for me on days where I'm not too hungry but still need to eat something so I'm not grumbling the rest of the day. You can fill your own sauce cup on the side."}
{"text":"Over the past 10 years, their prices on most dishes went up by a mere 50 cents!   My go to here is the scrambled egg with shrimp on fried rice noodles. For just $7.50, it is massive and tastes delicious. Add some of their chili sauce if you want more heat.   Comes with your choice of tea as well. Cash only. As with all other FMP foodcourt stalls."}
{"text":"Love this place. Portions are big and pricea are cheap. I always get their sweet and sour chicken which always comes out super hot ans fresh. The sauce is always on point with a good mixture and of sweet and sour. There are also alot of sweet peppers and pinapple too. It comes with either cold soy milk, chinese soup, or cold sweet Chrysanthemum tea. Chrysanthemum tea is great for skin cleansing! My sweet and sour chicken is $6.75 + tax. This place is located in the food court and gets busy during their peak hours during lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This review is only based on their dim sum items, I never actually bought a proper meal at this food court restaurant but whenever i do go to First Markham Place, I always get two items from here, their Fish Meat Siu Mai (Don't know what they call in English) and Soya Sauce Rice Noodle Roll (coeng fun).  If you do go to First Markham Place, I highly recommend picking up some dim sum snacks from this place, especially the Fish Meat Siu Mai!!  They make theirs super HUGE and they actually taste good with spicy soy sauce.  A MUST try if you decide to dine in at First Markham Place!"}
{"text":"I believe they changed their name to Yan Can Cook, but it's still the same guy in the corner making the delicious Sui Mai's, and their menu hasn't changed.   I crave their Fish Sui Mai's which are large and full of fish meat, and are super tasty when dipped into some soya sauce and chili oil. We also got the Chow Mein and their Chicken and Shark Fin Soup Set which is a mind blowing $4, which is a great deal compared to other food options in the food court. The Chow Mein comes in a large portion and is pretty tasty with some hoisin sauce and sesame. The Chicken and Mock Shark Fin Soup was definitely be the star of the show as it was surprisingly full of flavour (Not too much MSG flavour) and had alot of shredded chicken in it which I enjoyed.   Yan Can Cook is located inside First Markham Place, along with many other fast food stores and has been around for many many years. They have a variety of HK Style dishes and rice combos."}
{"text":"It's definitely a good place for fast food Chinese cuisine IF you're super hungry. I stress super hungry, because the portions in this place are simply unbelievable. I failed to finish one meal even with my grandma helping, and I was actually somewhat hungry that evening.  That being said, you get what you paid for. The prices are certainly on the low side and the quantity on the high side, but don't expect quality. I mean, it is a fast food stall after all, and honestly for what it is it's definitely more than satisfying for the average person eating lunch or dinner at First Markham Place.  The siu mai, however, is a must. One order is, if I remember correctly, 5 pieces. 5 large pieces, I should say. It's not something you should have every single time since it's so unhealthy, but at least once is more than filling.  Yan's Cook is one of the busiest stalls in the FMP food court, and with good reason too. With so much variety, huge portions, and low prices, all these combined attract the average person looking for cheap, quick fill you up food court cuisine."}
{"text":"I spent a year out of Canada, and when I came back, all I wanted to do is head on over to Yan's Cook (formerly Yan's Wok) and grab Combo C.    Their sweet and sour pork, with wonton soup, and spring roll, might just be the greatest thing I've ever eaten.  Unfortunately it's only available during the lunch rush, Monday to Friday.  Six dollars, for more food than you'll be able to finish is always a great value.  There are still a number of options, which come with drinks (instead of soup) at similar price points.  In fact, the sweet and sour pork is always on order - regardless of the date and time - it just doesn't hold the same charming allure when you're not ordering Combo C.  If you come during a busy time, be prepared to place your order, take a number, and wander First Markham Place for a little while, before coming back - claiming your food - and seeking out a table in the food court."}
{"text":"Yan Can Cook is a located in the popular First Markham Place food court.  I'm pretty sure it has no relation to Chef Martin Yan of the famed PBS series \"Yan Can Cook\" but they share the same name.  Btw I've met and dealt with Chef Yan before in the past...super nice guy and down to earth!  The food here is good, portions large and cheap.  They serve your typical Cantonese rice and noodle dishes but where they shine is the ready to serve dim sum snacks, especially their Fish Siu Mai.  They are the BEST in the GTA!    Huge, tasty and only $3!  You will not get fish siu mai that is better.  Pair that up with their chili garlic oil and you have a match made in heaven!  Definitely also try some of their other dim sum fare like the soya sauce rice noodles and curry fish balls as the dim sum fare are all $3-$5 each.  \"If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!\" - Copyright protected by the Yan Can Cook Corporation;p"}
{"text":"This review is based on 1 item on their menu, probably their trademark dish - the fish Sui Meye (mai) street style.  OMG, the Sui Meye here is super delicious and huge! They literally are made perfect size, texture, and flavour.  The guy sits there all day long making these. A must try if you're ever looking for a snack or Appetizer if you're in this food court!  $3 tax in for 5 huge pieces, $6 and you got yourself a meal.   BTW, if you don't know what these are, you must add spicy soy sauce or soy sauce to add flavour, this is how you eat this dish."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come back here for dinner ever since we were last in Toronto. Daughter ordered the beef with scrambled eggs. She preferred it runnier but the cashier said that they only do it scrambled. She liked it a lot. We also ordered bitter melon with fish and black bean sauce over rice. Fantastic! The bitter melon and black bean sauce make a nice combo! Both orders came with drinks. Finally, we also had the fish shu mai. That was a little overdone. Glad we came back here!"}
{"text":"The hunt for a good Chinese take out food court booth started when I was tasked to bring Friday night dinner to a ski chalet.  The objective was to impress my Canadian friends with delicious and large quantity of Asian food at a price that made their jaws drop.   I ordered and sampled from 3 food booths in total and concluded that Yan's Cook has the best value of food in terms of deliciousness, freshness, best cooking, volume and pricing combination (Yap, I analyzed this to death).  Yan's Cooks is a popular take out food booth.  Due to the high turnover, its ingredients are fresh.  The chef manages not to over cook every dish I have ordered so far; this is a testimony of his cooking skills.  In terms of deliciousness, the dishes taste good, but I must admit that they are quite oily most of the times (like 90%).  The food is not too salty per my taste.  The volume and pricing are in line with other food booths in First Markham Place.  BTW, the average price of the food court food at FMP is higher than most other Chinese malls.  In conclusion, I did feed my 3 friends with $35 of food, taxes included.  And we had to finish the food in 2 meals."}
{"text":"Food is super cheap and portions are large. Its a perfect place to get afternoon snacks if you are in the area. I have tried the sui mai (they are huge), soya sauce noodles, hot/sour soup. They were not amazing but were very good for under $4 I haven't tried their main dishes yet. They also serve quail, will be interested in trying that next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Been around for years and the quality is consistent Really can't go wrong and it goes above standard food court quality  Cheap affordable prices even now in 2017 Me and a friend ordered deep fried pork chops and fried fish with tofu Gave us two soups and two rices to go along Cost under $20, was about $19, forget the exact total  More than enough food for us, was so stuffed Definitely a staple for FMP if you seeking typical cantonese food :)"}
