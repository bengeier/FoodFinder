{"text":"We went to try out this new Peruvian restaurant in Rosemont. It's an area without a lot of restaurants, so I really would love to see it succeed. Still, though, you can tell that this place is new and they're still ironing out the wrinkles.    In terms of decor, the place is perhaps a little too simple and plain. But the owner/chef and server were both tremendously friendly and helpful at making recommendations on the menu. Their warmth and enthusiasm really made the experience great.   The menu is on a chalkboard and changes regularly based on monthly specials and customer feedback. The chef is Peruvian and clearly passionate about food. Having said that, the food itself was a bit uneven; the ceviche appetizer was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, but the entree I ordered (a chicken dish) was bland and overcooked and frankly not very appetizing. My friend ordered a beef dish that she said was cooked to perfection. So I suspect it may be a bit hit-or-miss. The restaurant is also still waiting for its alcohol license, so there are no alcoholic beverages being offered yet and only a handful of non-alcoholic choices.   Finally, I should note that the prices were very expensive for what it was. To pay over $50 for a casual dinner without drinks is just exorbitant for Montreal. I think I would've enjoyed the experience a lot more if the bill didn't leave such a sour taste in my mouth.  Not bad for a first attempt. I really hope they are able to sort out some of these issues and turn this into a success. I'd be happy to try it again in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I really like the ambience of this place. After returning from Peru a few months ago, this was a welcome change from routine.  For drinks, I have the Chicha maltdo, which was made from purpe corn, light but refreshing.  The white fish Ceviche was done just right. I had ordered the Branzino whole (broiled). It was a healthy portion and was well done with seasoning.  My husband did not have the same luck, his Monkfish was supposed to be crispy but turned out rubbery.   We finished off the meal with the coconut cake with fresh shavings of coconut on top. What a fresh, delectable and moist cake it was. I am tempted to return to purchase the cake itself, which can be made to order."}
{"text":"I have been twice now. The first time was when they just opened. It was great as the restaurant was not very busy so we had lots of attention from the staff. The second time was on a Saturday night and the pace was packed. The food is delicious, and based on food alone I would give this 5+ stars. Everything we ordered was superb, cooked to perfection with wonderful flavours.   That being said they need to polish the service a bit. The menu is very hard to read, the only way to tell the appetizers apart from the mains was the price point. Because the cuisine is Peruvian I needed lots of help understanding the menu, it seems as though only one or 2 of the staff actually knew what the dishes entailed, so there was quite a wait before we could order. In addition, we ordered wine which didn't arrive until after our food had been served.  So in sum - AMAZING FOOD - service still needs a bit of polish. But I was thrilled to see the place was so busy as this is a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First, I should say, I'm Peruvian born and raised. So I've had the real deal when it comes to Peruvian food :)  Atmosphere: nicely decorated, clean, relaxed feeling. I have been to all the Peruvian restaurants in Toronto, and this one certainly is the less rustic, more sophisticated one.   Service: the waiter was nice and informative. Explained what each dish was as he brought them. There was a bit of a delay between the appetizer and entrees, but, worth the wait  Food: we had:  Yucas a la huancaina: I'd rate them 3.5 out of 5. The sauce was a bit on the spicy side, just a hint less of aji and an extra minute frying the cassavas, and would have been perfect.   Seco de ternero: this was really delicious. It certainly is a heavy deviation from how the dish is originally meant to be, but spot on flavours. Having said that, it was a very small portion. Considering cost and flavour, 4 out of 5 score.   Creme brûlée: it was good. Not much to say about it, 4 out of 5  Pisco sour: this was probably the star of the night. Highly recommended. 4.5 out of 5.   This is a new place in the city and would certainly recommend it among my 2 choices for Peruvian restaurants in Toronto. Can't wait to try their lomo saltado, should they add it to the menu."}
{"text":"I love this Restaurant ! I have Ceviche and Wow one the very best  the sweet potato on top was like cherry on a cake good job guys. Anticuchos the beef heart was fabulous tender and grilled to perfection for me the best I have in long time. Pisco is a great place to grab a few drinks and have the best food ever if you looking for something different give this place a go Pisco is by far the best Peruvian Restaurant in Toronto ;) Don't forget to order dessert .........."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was exceptional as well. The chef was accommodating and took the time to adjust to our specific tastes and needs."}
{"text":"I was on vacation in toronto and wanted to tried a Peruvian place so I chose this one because it was closer to the hotel and it received many stars in this website.  I did not like this restaurant at all!  Food was not good for the amount of money I paid and the portion sizes were very small. I'm originally from Peru and I was very disappointed. Of course you can't expect too much because you are not in your country but seriously this place is expensive and the food is just not tasty at all.   I ordered anticuchos and jalea. Anticuchos tasted ok, meat was fresh but these were ridiculous small pieces for $10. The jalea had barely any seasoning and the picante (aji amarillo) lacked some salt and I can guarantee you it was not spicy. I had to mix it with rocoto so I could taste better. The size of the jalea was a joke!! It was like an appetizer size... So not worth the $24!  The only good thing was the pisco sour and that the place was very nice decorated and clean! Overall, the experience was mehhhh.... Nice place, nice service but the food is def not the best.. It lacks seasoning!! The dishes are decorated nicely but who wants to eat that? tourists from other countries will be very disappointed... Otherwise if you like peruvian food that has been Americanized and it's highly expensive for a small portion size, go ahead. Otherwise I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I gotta say as a Peruvian I was very dissapointed with the qualty of food and service.  It took a long while before someone brought us a menu or even said hi to us!! What happen to the south American charm?  When our Pisco sours finally arrived to the table we were pleasently surprise to see that the authentic recipe was used and no funky flavours were added.  Unfortunately things went downhill from then on. The ceviche we ordered has some weird yellow sauce. I think they used Aji amarillo instead of lime juice?. The portion was quite small and the taste was just weird. The Jalea took so incredibly long that we considered leaving and continuing our diner elsewhere.  Overall did not have a good experience here and would not recommende it to any friends that are curious about Peruvian cuisine."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. That's about it. Food, I've had better & for a better price.  Yes, I agree other places in Toronto are more \"rustic\", but I go for the food not necessarily decor...especially with what they charge at this place.  I am from Perú & I will not be going back to this place.  Would not & will not recommend it to anyone I know. With so much in Toronto, this place needs to find something that'll keep people coming back for more."}
{"text":"When we hear \"Pisco\" we think \"Peru\", and we expect a restaurant named after Peruvian brandy to offer the most premium brands and make the most elegant cocktails. It does! Finally, pisco has found a home in Toronto. In Lima, I was told, \"Pisco Sour is like a woman's breast: you can't have only one, but you should not have more than two\". We rush to Pisco, because we want many.  Love at first sip. A classic Pisco Sour cocktail is everything we had hoped: refined and well structured, and it begins with quality pisco that is simply unavailable anywhere else. What is pisco you ask? Pisco is a clear Peruvian brandy made entirely from Peruvian grapes distilled directly to proof. There is no added water or sugar--only pure distillation from Peruvian grapes. And with that, we open the menu to be transported to the most exciting gastronomy in the world.  Ceviche is the new sashimi. While it is popular throughout South and Central America, it originated in northern Peru. A sashimi cut of Mahi Mahi is summer-y and fresh; sweet purple potato balances the citric marinade, while toasted corn kernels provide crunch to the medley of textures. We want to scoop up all the rich flavour, to which brothers and co-owners Alessandro and Giancarlo Colombaro share their passion that, \"ceviche should be eaten with a spoon, because you need the flavour of the leche de tigre.\"  Next up, we sample Peru's answer to the mojito: the Chilcano. This is an Italian contribution to Peruvian gastronomy, typically made by combining pisco and ginger ale; here they use artisanal ginger beer, locally brewed, for a spritely kick. This is actually the best chilcano I've ever tasted.  Anticuchos, an African influenced dish, are chunks of beef classically served on skewers. Beef hearts marinated forty-eight hours with earthy, fruity Peruvian aji panca pepper are so tender and emit a subtle smoky essence from the pepper. Presented on a sweet corn mash and accompanied by crisp wedges of lightly herbed potatoes, this is a very generous portion of exotic flavours. A salsa of yellow pepper, cilantro and huacatay only enhances the flavour profile to greater heights.  The \"potato\" originated in Peru, and there are literally thousands of different kinds. There is also a myriad of corn of all shapes, colours and sizes. Peruvian cooking uses these staples in many dishes, but they are apportioned with such care that we could eat them with every single dish and not have the same taste experience twice.  The wine menu lists wines from South America, Washington and Prince Edward County deliberately chosen to match the versatility of the food, but we stay with the selection of pisco cocktails and order a Maracuya Sour-a pisco sour made with passion fruit that is a gentle tangy citric burst that sets my taste buds dancing.  Our waiter comes to change our silverware, and I notice he has donned a white glove: not for show, just for care. When he brings the lomo saltado, we want to applaud Chef Jason Koos. His presentation is, again, so clean and vibrant. As if cooked separately, each ingredient, from the bounty of tender grass-fed Alberta beef, to the crisp seasoned potato wedges, to the radiant tomatoes, is prepared to its a point. Peruvian jasmine rice is boiled in garlic, onion and spice, and perfectly textured to soak up the rich flavour of this abundantly portioned Chinese-influenced dish.  So, what is Peruvian cuisine? It is the original fusion cuisine with influences from Japan, China, Africa, Spain and local communities embracing the most bio-diverse ingredient base in the world. \"All the senses must be enticed\", Colombaro tells me. \"We eat with our eyes first.\" The contrast of colours and textures are essential, but he says, \"It's all about balance\".  I'm having a love affair with my pisco-soaked sour cherry crème brulee made for two. So rich and decadent, I simply cannot share. Anyone who has traveled to Peru will recognize, this is the authentic Peruvian cuisine that Toronto has long awaited.   Salud!"}
{"text":"Beau petit restaurant dans le vieux-Rosemont. Nourriture très goûteuse et bien présentée. Seul bémol est un des plats principaux, le poulet était très coriace"}
{"text":"Pisco just had a soft opening and was already full on its first Friday evening. They have great pisco cocktails, including several variants on the pisco sour and chlicanos made with locally-made ginger beer. They eventually plan to carry a large selection of piscos, The friendly and knowledgeable owners care about their ingredients and are making inventive and well-prepared variations on Peruvian traditional food. They are still waiting for some ingredients to arrive and experimenting a bit, but we had a great meal and I'm very excited about this place."}
{"text":"Overall I had a pretty good dining experience here. It appears that they are really sticking to a true peruvian style which I find it important as its not a \"Canadian\" take on Peruvian cuisine. I spent several months in Lima on business and this resto had the same dishes/recipes so I enjoyed it a lot!   Totally brought me back to me Lima days! Highly recommended.  Cheers,"}
