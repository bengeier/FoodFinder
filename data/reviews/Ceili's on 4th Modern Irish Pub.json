{"text":"WARNING: DO NOT TIP! They secretly include the gratuity on the bill and then also ask for a tip on the debit machine. Once you have been drinking or are distracted, you will tip. Went for a work function and the guy who paid didn't know they already charged a $56.00 tip and then he tipped $60.00 on top of that. Crap waitress walked away with a $116 tip and was laughing coz how many times does that happen in a night? LOTS. So sly and scummy. I never noticed until he gave me the bill to expense. I will not return that is so shady and disrespectful to people's wallets."}
{"text":"This is a very nice venue for a drink with friends. Always popular and crowded, music is just a bit too loud for my taste but that's really the only thing I can complain about :)

Nice service, lots of different options in the menu, and reasonable drinks and prices."}
{"text":"The food at this place was alright but I definitely won't be coming back.  This is a place that seems to care more about treating regulars like royalty than acknowledging new customers.  As far as drinks go it was relatively well priced but an Irish pub that can't make several irish drinks is not impressive"}
{"text":"they were extremely busy when we were there. my wife gave the bartender a 10$US and received 2$CA for 8$CA bill. The Pig&Duke Pub down the street was impeccably honest in our monetary exchange. Is a few dollars worth a negative review"}
{"text":"Terrible online booking system.  Can't even change the reservation online without calling the restaurant.  Use Opentable like everyone else!"}
{"text":"Ok, coming into this pub with four guys that are pretty easy going was good because we didn't  have high expectations. The food was so good! The bf had a pulled meat grilled cheese which was yummy and I had the steak sandwich with fries... Scrumptious! I fully enjoyed all of my 6oz steak and large garlic wedge of bread.... 
I didn't like how dark and loud it got but still enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"I'm probably going to have to go to this place on a day or a time that is not busy to truly see what this place is about but from the few times I have gone here I rather goto my usual joints.

First off it is incredibly loud in this place after work on a Friday and although that might seem normal in a club atmosphere in a pub one I don't feel that it is right. I will give a high five to the fact that on Friday at 4pm this place is packed to the brim. 

However, where they have excess in patrons they lose in service because it takes anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes to get a drink once you've ordered it and you are still waiting 20 to 30 minutes just for someone to come around to take your order.

No thanks, I rather go to Joey's and have a Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc where I'm served before I even sit down and all the ladies know me by first name."}
{"text":"I booked a private room for a work event.  The staff helped me out last minute as the reservation didn't seem to be communicated correctly.  Anyway, they cleaned up the room for us right away. 
We had drinks and appetizers.  My group were really happy with everything that they had.
I agree with one reviewer who said that the music should be Irish.  We were able to turn it off in our room so the top 40 didn't intrude in our space.
I will definitely be back for group events."}

Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 1.5/5
Overall experience: 1/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

If there was a rating of ZERO, I would give Ceilis this. Ceilis on 4th is fairly new and unless you work downtown, it's inconvenient to get to because of the lack of parking. 

My first experience was during the Stampede for dinner and I thought it was pretty decent - our waitress was attentive and the chef was nice enough to divide my 'Beef Dip' sandwich ($14.50) order onto separate plates when I told the waitress I was sharing. The sandwich was just average but I loved the side of beer battered onion rings. 

However, after my most recent visit during their Wednesday Wings Night, I am never going back again! I have never been more frustrated with service. Admittedly, it was really busy, but it was still no excuse for our waitress to be gone for long periods of time. She never came by to 'check up' on our group and it was only until she came back with drinks or food we were able to order more.

It took forever to get our food and drinks. Our drinks would take at least 15min to get and it came to a point where we decided to not order any more food because it would take another half an hour or more to get it. Two of my friends ordered 30 wings which never came! They asked the waitress 3 times when they would get their wings and she would always reply with \"They are coming\". Her excuse was that the waitress wasn't responsible for bringing the wings out - the least she could do was go into the kitchen to check up on them. After waiting over an hour my friends got fed up and decided to eat elsewhere. At least she took the order of wings off the bill.

They also kept running out of items like their 'chipotle bbq' wing flavour and one of their domestic drafts which was on sale that night. You would expect to be well stocked for a busy 'specials' night. 

I DO NOT recommend you go to Ceilis for their wings because they are terrible. They were so bad that even though I was super hungry I couldn't force myself to eat them - they were tiny with little to no meat, cold, soggy, and the sauce was put on so poorly. The flavours were limited to hot, ghost pepper (extremely spicy, will burn your mouth), honey garlic, honey hot (not hot at all), salt and pepper, and Chipotle BBQ. 

The only thing that I like about Ceili's on 4th is the decor and how large it is. On a side note, this location has an oyster bar with the rest of their menu consisting of your typical bar food with select Irish dishes (~$15+). Their draft beers are pretty expensive at about $8.00 a pint and bottles being $8.00 with a small selection.

Overall, I do not recommend going to Ceilis on 4th for drinks. There are equally better pubs on Stephen Ave or 17th."}
{"text":"Hmm an Irish pub, that has a top40 DJ...weird. 

We were doing a Friday after work drink session and trying places, loving most Ceili's (I still miss the roof top on 8th) we popped in to this one to check it out. As mentioned, the music was terrible and was so loud you could barely talk to the person next to you. I go to pubs so I'm able to have a convo and a drink, not yell at each other. 

Service sucked, it took 20+ minutes to get a drink, another 15+ to get the drink. The food was decent and I will give them credit for actually listing what is GF, which includes wings and dry ribs, two things I love and can rarely eat. 

I'm sure I'll end up here again, but maybe sit in a back corner, as anywhere else was too loud, especially for 5pm on Friday."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the staff from the office, server didn't bring cutlery with the food, or for the entire duration of the meal. We had to ASK for napkins.... You'd think that maybe since we're eating we'd require napkins and cutlery. 
Sometimes I feel like establishments are hiring tits and ass over common sense and intelligence. Who ever this girl was she needs to seriously re think her industry choice."}
{"text":"It is a decent place to eat but nothing fantastic.  It is loud and noisy, and service was mediocre. The standard franchise type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Ceili's is the classic Canadian take on an Irish pub.

Do you like Guinness? Do you like pub food? Do you mind paying downtown level prices? Well then you are in the right place. While Ceili's is not really providing any great deals, they are still a decent place to go downtown when you are in the mood for a pub atmosphere. The food they have is generally quite good. My guilty pleasure is the deep fried mac and cheese sticks with the spicy ketchup. Combining sriracha with ketchup was a great idea and the only way I'll eat fries at Ceili's from now on. I grabbed the burger I was there last and it was delicious. Nothing really unique about it, but it was cooked perfectly and served with fresh toppings.

Wednesday is wing night at Ceili's for 39 cents a wing. While not the greatest deal in town, they do some pretty decent wings if you find yourself in the mood. The only drink specials are domestic beer though, so they easily get your money through the drinks.

As I have only been to Ceili's at its busiest times (I assume), lunch and immediately after work, it is always busy and sometimes can be difficult to get service. It's the level you would expect from any pub in their situation though.

Overall a decent place to go when you want the relaxed and friendly pub atmosphere and someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my Canada Day experience. Came in with a few friends as an escape from the downpour, there were a lot of empty tables and given how close this place was to the festivities that should have been a red flag.

It took a good 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server, and after ordering drinks it took another 20 for them to arrive. It was THEN that another server mentioned in passing as she saw us looking at menus \"oh, did anyone tell you that we don't have any food?\". Uhmmmm no?

We got the spiel how they were short staffed and the kitchen manager had some other issues and so they decided to close the kitchen. I've worked as a server before and stuff happens, I get that. What peeved me is that we should have been told as soon as we sat down as we would have immediately left.

So yes, they made money on our one round of drinks, but ultimately they're losing because no one in our party will likely ever return."}
{"text":"How can anyone not feel amazing when they walk in here? Beautiful staff, fresh food, hot bartenders.  Wings are amazing. And the Chili Lime Chicken Tacos and the Cobb Salad.  The place is usually packed for a reason..... Great job!"}
{"text":"Only because the place looks good. 

Bison burger for me and fish & chips for my co worker/ dinner partner. Both of us became ill 2:00 later. Fortunately we both felt better the next morning after getting our systems cleaned out. Thanks for the colonic Ceilis! Not what you want to do while traveling. 

We had watched the bartenders shatter a full glass of beer over the waitress station and still serve the drinks. Hope no one got their stomachs cut with glass!

Shortly after that one dropped a full bottle of Captain Morgan behind the bar in front of us. Not much cleanup occurred. 

Bartenders go from cutting/placing fruit in drinks to making change to wiping up messes. Never saw one wash their hands. They are too busy pumping out drinks for the waitresses. 

Not an overly large beer selection for an Irish Pub but they at least have Harp and Guinness. 

Food was average at best. This is the equivalent of a poorly run chain restaurant. 

I'll look for something more local the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I heard that they just changed up their menu. WOAH! they have a burger that they called \"Mac Daddy\". A cool name so what is that you ask? OK! its a 6oz beefy patty in between a bun made out of mac and cheese. Yes a bun made out of mac and cheese. That sounds crazy right!

So I came here and I just had to try it. It looked dry at first glance but it was very cheesy melty. So basically half a burger really filled me up. The burger was huge. It also came with fries or greens. I picked the greens. 

It was an interesting burger but was not cheap. Its one of those things that you will get once. Also, I like this location here. Its convenient, downtown. 

Cool atmosphere for a pub."}
