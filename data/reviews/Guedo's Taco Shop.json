{"text":"Best tacos in town! I used to go to the old location in Chandler and was so excited to hear they're back! Same great tacos and service. The bartender and staff were so friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been eating at Guedo's for 15 years.  Missed a year or so while they relocated.  BEST Carne Asada & Fish Tacos !!! I normally don't eat out Mexican food, I'm very picky because I'm Mexican and cook it at home, but Guedo's is a restaurant I visit sometimes weekly.  Totally AUTHENTIC MEXICAN !!!! No cheddar cheese here!!!  Margaritas are pretty awesome too.  Must give it a try."}
{"text":"Never been to Guedos when it was in Mesa and now it's down the street from me. I really enjoyed the atmosphere food was great and the staff was amazing. I will be back ;)"}
{"text":"Guedo's is awesome.  Same exact flavors as original place.  Plus they have chive TV.  Chive on."}
{"text":"Cool looking place, staff was friendly, and the wait time for food was fast.....too fast. The food came out and it was obviously premade then warmed up when the kitchen received the order. I hate to speak negatively about local business but it was the worst food I've ever had. The best thing we ate was the kids chicken strips and fries (not a compliment or a joke). I felt like I was robbed of $50 when I left. Save some money and go to Filaberto's."}
{"text":"I always love finding a new taco place to try.  This place is a little drive from Queen Creek but will be my go to!  Tacos were amazing.  The staff was great.  Steak tacos (beef tacos on menu) melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Portions are perfectly sized, food is seasoned well, quality is consistent. Wife loves the salsa bar. Although the ordering process is slightly different than other restaurants of similar fare, it in no way detracts from the quality of the visit. I've been three times since opening, and while there were some kinks to work out (kinks that any new business has), they have since been resolved. This is a local business that I am more than happy to support."}
{"text":"This is some of the most authentic Mexican food in the valley (with bigger portions than actual Mexican food). My family has come to Guedos religiously, every Saturday for lunch, for the past 8 years. When they closed down for a year my family fell into a state of depression. But now they are back under new management but they managed to keep the exact same taste as they did 8 years ago. The only thing that has changed is the location. (And the quality of the building)."}
{"text":"Saw mixed reviews but thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and give them a try. Went in to order food to go. Ordering was a little different. No combos, need to order each item separately including cheese on your items.  Ordering went quickly as I was the only one on line. Ordered two tacos, rice, beans and a shrimp quesadilla for $22. Food came out  fast, 10 minutes later. Had to remind the waitress that the food was to go as it wasn't packed to go. Got home and realized they didn't put the cheese I paid extra for on my tacos. Tacos were good, even without the cheese. Overall food was just OK. However, I'm not feeling the whole experience for the price."}
{"text":"You've got to get pork tacos with cheese and avocado. And the best salsa is the pico de gallo or tomatillo (green salsa). That's the best food in the world."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Food is average and there are better taco places. Use to go to the one in chandler and the food was much better."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, amazing decor and just an overall fantastic experience!  Go check them out.  Love the pork and carne Asada burrito!!"}
{"text":"How can you screw up a bean and cheese burrito? Well, we live close by and thought we'd give this place a shot. Not impressed,we will continue to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I never comment because most of the time yelp steers me right and I enjoy, or am prepared for, my dining experience.  I have to say that yelp let me down in a big way on this place.  I ordered the guedo burrito with chicken and felt like I was being pranked when it showed up.  Completely bland, zero flavor, and the worst burrito I can ever recall eating.  I don't know how it is legal to open a \"taco shop\" and be allowed to serve the burrito I ate.  Four and half stars?  Your rating system is broken yelp."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with 2 kids. Upon entering, I saw salsa bar at the corner, then we were greeted by host who happened to be our waiter. Chips came right away but no salsa, it turned out I had to get it myself from the salsa bar (so waiter didn't give all the service typically at other establishments). He gave the menu, which was printed on regular copy paper, but it had food stains! Prices were a bit high. He took our order, food came within expected time, but taste was bland, even after adding salsa which I had to get up again and get myself. I would be fine to pay premium for quality food, but this wasn't it. Sorry, I won't come back."}
{"text":"$1 surcharge for debit/credit for over-priced tacos?! No thanks! FYI- no sign posted or anything advising you of the charge until the tell you when you pay. On the contrary the signs say they gladly accept cards."}
{"text":"We loved this place when they were in chandler. Just as good at this new location. Best fish tacos in the universe!! The beef tacos and meat filled cheese crisps are great, too."}
{"text":"Seriously loved the fish tacos tonight!  The Peacemaker Margarita is simply the best after a long day at the office!  I'm in love, and the shrimp tacos are just as amazing!  My husband has the shrimp burrito  and it was loaded with shrimp.  Out son has a quesadilla.  The prices were great and the portions were plenty.  We will totally be back for more!   The atmosphere was busy but relaxed!  The staff was  very friendly and helped us pick the perfect selections for our night!   This will likely be our top spot for family dinners each week!"}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely going to be a regular hangout for my husband & I! We love Mexican food & this one is sure delicious. We order two mixed tacos with cheese & two chicken tacos with cheese. The cheese was melted between the tortillas, which was so delicious & unique. The salsa bar was great because you could get what you want & go back for seconds! Chips tasted so fresh. The bartender was fabulous with making sure our drinks were full, and we were there on their 2nd day of opening. The line was out the door almost the entire time we were there. My husband & I sat at the bar for almost 4 hours eating & enjoying a few beers! Delicious! Great atmosphere & friendly people working too, which made  our experience even better. Am looking forward to happy hour options in the future, as we talked to the owner about eventually offering that, which will be a bonus for us. Regardless of that, we'll definitely be back! Can't wait to try more options on the menu!!"}
{"text":"We were sad when they lost their downtown Chandler location - they are now quite a bit further away for us but we still make the trip to get our Guedo's fix.   The veggie bean tacos and pork folded cheese crisps (quesadilla) are some of our favorites.   Love the options on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday & happy hour~~great combo! We ordered carne asada tacos...filled with really good flavorful steak. Good salsa bar as well... in addition to very good chips. They apparently just started table service.. good idea on their part."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and the food is very good; a bit over priced.  I will agree that the ordering process needs improvement."}
{"text":"We used to go to the old location near downtown Chandler and was always pleased with the food and service.  My daughter loved to find seashells in the sand.  Lol!  We decided to try this new location after hearing great things about it.  We went on a Tuesday night for \"taco Tuesday\" and we were not impressed.  The steak and chicken tacos were ok.  We didn't care for the pork ones at all.  The restaurant was not busy and the service was not good.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of what they call a stuffed cheese crisp aka quesadilla. I alternate between the chicken and beef sometime I just get both of I'm really hungry. The other thing is the salsa on my god. I love the pico and green salsa.  Not spicy just lots of flavor.  Generally I like spicy sometimes the red has a bite to it but I prefer the green at Guedo's. My significant other always gets shrimp tacos. I'm a true gringo because I always try to stay with flower and avoid the corn."}
{"text":"I would give it less than one star if that was an option...  The ordering process is incredibly disorganized.  Compared to other Mexican themed eateries that do not have a server, this place is incredibly overpriced and not set up for positive customer service.  We were a family of six and were told that they are rationing their chips to a paltry amount per table per visit.   We live within five minutes of this place and were very hopeful... Incredibly disappointed!!!  Highly recommend you do not waste your time and money here.   Chicken was...bland Salsa is like ketchup.  Pico made with unripened tomatoes.   Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was the same place that once was in Chandler. I recognized the way the tacos tasted when we ordered and I'm so glad we came in! The shrimp tacos are SO GOOD. My husband got the Guedo Burrito and liked it a lot. The prices are excellent for what you get. So glad this place is close to my house. The employees are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Just checked out the new Guedes and you can be sure it has the same good stuff of the old place. Bigger and better with draft Dos Equis for three bucks! Burros are great and even bigger! Ignore the naysayers they must be newbies!"}
{"text":"Guedo's is back!!!! I tried one of each of their tacos and of course the cheese crisp. All of them were delicious. The beef was by far out of this world. Perhaps even better than the original Guedo's on 87. Is that possible?   The owners did a really nice job with this new location staying true to the theme and feel. All of the staff here was super friendly and helpful. They even went out of their way to take special care my children making them feel super special. One of them asks to go back there for dinner every night.   An all around awesome dining experience. Thank your Guedo's and all your staff!!!"}
{"text":"So incredibly sad to see this place is closed! We drive all the way from SCOTTSDALE just for the tacos here - they are literally the best tacos I've ever had anywhere.   I heard a rumor they might open at a different location, and I hope they do soon!!!"}
{"text":"It was a good thing we arrived early to the private event at Guedo's taco shop tonight for there was a line out the door.  Order taking was slow due to brand new staff but all was very friendly.  We ordered tacos and cheese crisps from the limited menu tonight and really liked the street tacos.  Crisp edges made these favorites especially good.  Cheese crisps were run of the mill.  I'd like to revisit to sample their shrimp burro and shrimp tacos in the future."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are always down for good Mexican food. Unfortunately, I wouldn't put Guedos in that category. We went in on a busy Friday night (which is usually a good sign), but that's where it ends. While waiting in line to order, I swear it smelled like pesticides which probably has to do with the fact they share a wall with a bug and weed store. We decided on fish tacos, steak tacos, a burrito, and nachos. The bill was over $40 which is pricey for the quality. Also, you need to be sure to request your taco toppings when ordering - including cheese (which is supposedly layered between the flour tortillas). The steak tacos were literally just cubes of steak in a flour tortilla.  Oh and don't bother with the guac - pretty sure it was store bought and squeezed out of a bag. The staff was friendly and attentive, so no complaints about the service. Overall, disappointing and we won't be back."}
{"text":"These are white people tacos and I'm white. Original location had charm. This new location is trying and the service was great.  Picky eaters who only order carne asada on flour tortillas with cheese and cheese crisps will fall flat on there faces and proclaim best tacos ever. We know better. Without the the experience of the the original location, this taco shop will hold a special place in your heart if like ranch with everything. Wait staff at the bar provided tremendous service and the interior is welcoming. Good luck with the drive-through interior ordering system.   Tried for a second time. Beyond unimpressed. Bland white people Mexican food. Everyone in this place is old white people with spice as the eye can see. I get it but I don't. You can make a cheese crisp at home for way less than $9. If you like it cool. Just don't call it Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican, sit down restaurant price. Extra for everything, rude cashier. Burrito was marginal, at best. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tacos were great as always! Our waiter today was on point! This guy should open a school on how to wait tables! Food and service are always good this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Finally Guedo has his famous restaurant open in Gilbert now. This was a staple for great food and terrific atmosphere in Chandler. Now his delicious food is back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the atmosphere really detracts from my desire to come back.  They have all of the windows blacked out by Corona ads and further blocked by straw canopy decorations, so you literally cannot see inside the restaurant from the outside.  Once inside, it's really dark since there's basically no natural light.  Then they have pop music playing on the speakers?  Listening to Justin Bieber in an otherwise silent restaurant doesn't make you feel like you're at an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the first time coming here. It's a pretty casual atmosphere.  We got there right as it opened so it wasn't crowded. We ordered the stuffed tostada with beef,  shrimp taco and a beef taco with a side of rice and beans.  They have a salsa bar with different salsas and toppings.  Overall the tacos were tasty. My husband especially liked the shrimp tacos.  I think we'll go back on taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"We love this new taco shop and will be back many times. It helps that they serve Mexican Moonshine tequila!"}
{"text":"Tacos were nothing to write home about. I ordered them with cheese and they said it was in between the two tortillas. When I took the torts apart, the amount of cheese was so minimal.  But the stuffed tostadas were really good. I'd come back and explore other menu options."}
{"text":"I took my 7 year old twins and hub here during a weeknight. The live music was a treat and my kids totally got a kick out of it....they didn't want to leave. Our server was great, very attentive and helpful.  I ordered the top shelf margarita during happy hour for $5! It was really good, it wasn't from a bottle but made from real limes and simple syrup which I surely appreciate. The shrimp tacos were fresh very good for those of you who are shrimp taco enthusiasts. I heard the chicken taco was fabulous but I couldn't even finish it. It had too much cinnamon in the sauce...almost like a mole. 4 drinks and 4 meals for under $40...give this place a thumbs up. I will definitely be back!   The bar was small but looked really cute. Would be fun to do Happy Hour there on the cheap."}
{"text":"Really great local place.  With wonderful service and bartender. Seriously the best margarita I have had in Arizona. Not that sweet syrup, actually shaken. Food was sooo good. Loved the bar with all the fixings and sauces. FINALLY found a go to place."}
{"text":"I like Guedo's Taco Shop.  It's new and clean and the food is well made.  The old Guedo's in Chandler had a certain charm that is gone but this Guedo's is still very good.  The portions are generous. The meat used in the dishes is deliciously cooked. There's still a taco hot sauce condiment bar to do up your food just the way you like it.  You order and pick up your own food.  There's a small bar area and the seating is comfortable.  Try it.  It's genuine Mexican food, not Southwest."}
{"text":"Best tacos and margaritas in town! Newly open Mexican restaurant with delicious tacos (beef, pork shrimp and chicken) all amazing! Tried the new chambord margarita last night, very flavorful! Try it out!"}
{"text":"REALLY really good!  New location, same great food.  I was glad to see Guedos open. So much meat in their tacos.  Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Holy fu***! I order 2 easy plain burritos.. they said \"less than 10 min. \" 20 mins later, lost my appetite and patience.. def not coming back!"}
{"text":"I am shocked this place has good reviews. My husband and I tried here twice, just in case it was an off night, and we won't be back.  The staff was kinda friendly, slow service especially considering they only had 2 other tables.  We tried the chicken, carne asada, and pork tacos the first time. The chicken had a weird flavor(staff called it an \"acquired taste\" after I said we thought it tasted off), the pork had a lot of seasoning and was heavy on the cinnamon, very dry and chewy, the carne asada the first time was very tender and flavorful the first time and 2nd was over salted(along with the rest of our food) and chewy. $4 for a tiny, plain taco is insane.  Some of the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"It was good food. Not good for me since I have bad hands. I would have liked a tray to retrieve all the utensils,  condiments, sauce from the bar. I didn't like my drink in the disposable cup. But this is a fun spot! Go with a friend!"}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious and the tequila selection is great. Great food/drinks for little money."}
{"text":"We ate here over the weekend and were overall very happy. We ordered one of each taco (beef, pork, fish) and had a side of their whole pinto beans. A friend of ours ordered a chicken burrito. We were all very satisfied with the food. The only thing that was not the greatest was the fish taco. It was a bit over cooked but not worth docking off a point. I also ordered a margarita there and boy they sure don't hold back on the booze. Prices are fairly reasonable, but they do charge for extras for pretty much anything you want to add on to it and it can add up quick. I will be a loyal customer as long as they don't cut back on quality or food portion sizes."}
{"text":"Jen & I stoped by to try them out and was very happy with our meal we both had the he carne asada tacos that were very good and the meat very tender with a good portion of meat in them."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, since I live right behind it, and walked there for dinner with my wife. Ordering at the counter was a pain, especially since we planned on having a few drinks and enjoying a nice date night, but ohh well. Food came out quickly, and first thing I thought was it better be awesome because it is HORRIBLY overpriced for what you get. I had the guedo burro and wife had 1 chicken taco and 1 beef taco. Burrito was \"meh\" at best. Especially for $8.50 or whatever it was. Lots of beans, little meat, and nothing to make it special. Betos or any of the local quick burrito places are better for 1/2 the price. The chicken taco was ok, good flavor on the chicken, but once again nothing special or worth the $4 for a tiny single taco. The beef was just beef. No seasoning, no flavor. Highlight of the meal was probably the $3 dos equis. Makes me wish Jimmys of Chicago didn't leave that spot, because it was great, and guedos isn't.   They also either need to go to full out counter service with a better counter to order, or get waiters and go full sit down IMO. Give you some chips or beans/rice to justify the price, and work on the seasoning/flavor (chicken was only good thing that had flavor)."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this restraunt!! I've never had a bad thing on the menu. My boyfriend is OBSESSED with the Pork Guedo Burrito and orders it every time we eat in or order out.   We go here on average once a week and every server we've had is super friendly, helpful and accommodating and to top it off..the prices are amazing !   You will not be disappointed eating here!"}
{"text":"I ordered tacos for takeout. Service was quick and friendly and I liked the salsa bar options. I ordered one chicken, one pork and 2 carne asada tacos. I thought the pork and chicken were very bland and used the sass to cook it up. My husband enjoyed the carne asada so I tried a piece of his meat and agreed with him.  If we go back, we will both stick with the carne asada."}
{"text":"Was not very impressed with the tacos we had the pork tasted very bland no flavor at all The chicken also tasted the same no flavor the only thing I felt was OK was the cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Holy balls. This could very well be the greatest carne asada burrito I've had in the United States. Plus the service was amazing. Great atmosphere, great music and got our food fast. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Five stars for their fish burritos and fish tacos. By far the best Ive had in AZ. The only thing i didnt like was their drink situation. Just put the soda machine where we can get our own refills (preferred), please, or go to full service (or provide bigger cups that dont require frequent refills). I am a stickler about beverages because I have a condition that makes me NEED a beverage at all times while eating (Google EE if you are curious) so the beverage station will make or break a place for me. Until then it'll just be a takeout only place for me."}
{"text":"Not exactly what we were expecting from this restaurant. Not bad but not great. Ordered a pork cheese crisp which is basically a folded quesadilla not a lot of cheese and difficult to eat, have to tear or cut with fork & knife. Veggie rice burrito was just okay for my vegetarian daughter basically was rice, cheese and guacamole. And I got a pork taco and chicken taco, neither come dressed and cheese is extra charge. There is a salsa bar which is where you can go get your own toppings. Red and green salsa, some cabbage or lettuce shreds, limes, pico de Gallo is all I recall.  The pork was chopped and on the sweet side. The chicken is cooked in some sort of red enchilada sauce but not much flavor. They bring out chips when your seated depending on the size of your group is how much you get. By again, you need to go get your own salsa. Whether your dining in or take out the cups for salsa are extremely small. I'm not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"So glad to have Guedos back!!! Food hasn't changed at all, very authentic. The shrimp and beef tacos are to die for. Will miss the old spot but this location is really convenient and clean inside. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"So glad Guedos has reopened in Gilbert. I was a weekly visitor when it was in Chandler and missed it so much!! Was pleased to find the new location was very welcoming and extremely authentic to the original. These are the exact same amazing tacos. Will miss the old sand patio but this place was great!! So glad I can get these tacos whenever I want again! The beef and shrimp are second to none"}
{"text":"I came here last Tuesday for Taco Tuesday because of all the great reviews. I ordered their beef tacos. The flavor was ok ... only problem was, I was sicker than you can imagine shortly after and my entire week was ruined. Went to ER because I was not able to keep fluid in and nearly passed out multiple times. I was diagnosed with food poisoning and dehydration. Never eating here again. I don't even want to think about tacos anymore :("}
{"text":"I love their veggie burros!!! I use to go here when it was in downtown chandler and I loved it then and love it now! I introduced my kids to it and it's our neighborhood go to!!"}
{"text":"Lunch gathering with friends... fresh and delis house food... festive environment. Only thing that kept them from a 5 was the Margarita was flat..  little watered down... great place, we will come again and hope for a 5"}
{"text":"Best Taco's in town! (Good for drinks too). Mixed Guedo Burro is fantastic and the Beef Taco's are spot on. Can't forget to mention the salsa bar, great selection.  The staff was friendly, prompt and even the owner Justin came out to greet us and make sure we were happy with everything.  Whether your looking for a quick bite to eat, or a cool place to beat the heat and have a drink.... \"Get Taco'd\" and head to Guedo's!"}
{"text":"Got the shrimp cheese crisp. More shrimp than expected. Great prices too! The ordering process is different than the norm,  but that happens.  Great food that I've had, clean fun atmosphere. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing late afternoon lunch here. Edgar was awesome and very helpful.The food was perfect. We ordered tacos, a burro, and a tostada! They also have a salsa bar. We just wanted to try everything! All of the meats were cooked perfectly! Will come again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I and my husband were a little disappointed with our order with Guedo's tonight. He called in to place an order, was put on hold...not even a real hold, as he could hear all the orders being taken while he waited. He ended up going to the location, while remaining on the phone. His timer clocked 30 mins by the time he got to the register. He asked the cashier iif she was going to pick up the phone because he has been on hold for 30 mins. She responded with a \"oh, why didn't you hang up and call back?\" I get they are probably pretty busy, but that is not really what I would expect for customer service. He proceeded to order and then wait. It took 40 mins to get his order. No \"sorry for the wait\".   Food was ok. My Guedo's burrito with chicken and cheese was lacking in chicken but what was there was pretty dry chicken cubes. Chips however were delicious!  Need improvement on customer service and the flow of inbound orders via phone and on site.  I think will be waiting until these kinks get worked out before visiting again.  3/12/2017 I read Justin's response. It was not my husband you talked to so probably some other dissatisfied customer, sorry to say. However, I'm glad to hear you have talked to the staff and I'm hoping things improve should we decide to check you guys out again."}
{"text":"This should be 3 1/2 Stars ... It was clean and we did like the salsa bar. Chips we a little heavy for my liking I prefer nice light ones.. Taco were alright nothing to brag about. Service was good. For a place that's in a strip mall it was it decorated well"}
{"text":"Second time here since they opened.  The taco's were even better than the first time if that's possible. Get the Chicken taco's with cheese and avocado and sit close to the salsa bar since you'll want to return often for more. We met the owner Justin tonight.  He was very hospitable and made us feel like good friends.   I'll have to go back for another fix soon!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and the service people are very friendly. The salsa bar has amazing collection and all are very tasty. This is my to go place for mexican food."}
{"text":"Guedo's is awesome from the service to their food.  You walk in and order from and the staff give you a number so the server can bring your food out to you.  While you wait on your food you can go to the salsa bar and load up.  The red has just the right amount of spice to it without being over the top.    I've been to Guedo's many times and try something different each time.   The shrimp quesadilla was my favorite with the beef taco coming in a close second."}
{"text":"Guedo's is a just \"okay\" Taco Shop  The staff was a bit inattentive, we had to go ask for chips to be brought to the table since and you have to get your own salsa. The condiment bar is poorly stocked.   *Specialializing in soft shell tacos, carne asada, carnitas, pollo,and pescado.* Not so much... been here twice.   The tacos were ok, but overpriced for the level of quality. The meat seemed dried out and had been around for a while.   The place is clean"}
{"text":"Guedo's is back and I can't believe I waited so long to check it out! Will definitely be making this a weekly stop! Excellent and tastes like the Guedo's that my family have enjoyed for over 20 years!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  I love the new location. I love the new art work they put up last week.  I like how they have servers and I don't have to wait in a long line to place my order.  The servers are surprisingly good.  I love how they have coke. The old place had pepsi.  I also like the live music on Thursday nights.  I'm not sure they do it every week.  Food is just as good as it always has been if not better at the new location.  Still one of my favorites in Phoenix after all these years."}
{"text":"Moved away a dozen years ago so when I recently found myself in the area I had to visit the new Guedo's  taco shop.  Nice they have waitress service but you want a napkin or fork or salsa you have to go get it yourself.  Salsa bar nice but pico de gallo mushy, seemed old, flavors very indistinct.  The red salsa way too spicy.  The \"stuffed meat cheese crisp\" was just as I remembered!  Great cheese and steak flavor tho I must say it's a big folded over tortilla (like a quesadilla) and there is a considerable margin around the edges where it's all tortilla and no meat/cheese."}
{"text":"Geudo's Taco Shop...Not The Original Location, But The Food Remains The Same!  We used to eat Guedo's at least one or twice a month when I was in College.  Back then, Guedo's was located in Downtown Chandler and had the first sandy beach patio in town.  Fast forward 20 years and Guedo's is no longer located in Downtown Chandler, but in South Gilbert.  Great location, but sans sandy beach patio.  This is okay though, as the menu and quality of food have remained the same.  The new Guedo (new owner) has kept all the original recipes from the old menu and they are all just as good as I remember from back in the day.  This is still a family owned and operated business and I hope all my Yelp friends will support their wonderful restaurant!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were heartbroken - and hungry - when we pulled into the parking lot of the old location and found that it had closed down.  We heard rumors that it was reopening and stalked them for months on Facebook.  It is like they transported our familiar favorites to a new, cleaner location. We were worried that they might mess with the recipes, but they have stayed true to them.  Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Fish taco was good.  Street tacos are pricy at $3+ each.  Salsas and chips are good.  My dinner party wasnt thrilled though with the food."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try for the first time this week, based on seeing recommendations and pictures in the Living Chandler Facebook group.  We weren't going in for a meal, just for nachos and margaritas (a snack).  I did a quick look up on Yelp just to see what other people were saying about the place and was happy to see that most of the reviews were 4+ stars.  There were a couple of negative reviews and all I can say after going there is to take those reviews with a grain of salt (and maybe a lime and a shot of tequila too)!   When you enter the restaurant the atmosphere is pleasant, the staff is friendly and the place is very clean.  When we went in it was on a Wednesday afternoon so there weren't a lot of people in there.  I wasn't sure how the place worked but then discovered that you order your food and then take a number to your table to wait for the food.  I knew we were going to be having drinks so we ended up just sitting at the bar.  Ordered our drinks and food and both came out very quickly.  First the drinks: they were great!  Full size margarita's with real lime juice and straight tequila, no watered down mixers.  You can't beat the price either: $4?  Give me six more!  The food serving was nice and big.  We ordered nachos but the bartender brought out a basket of chips while we waited.  They also have a salsa bar with pico, onions, green and red salsa, peppers, etc.  Delicious and everything was fresh.   Our bartender was Michael and he was very friendly and attentive.  We were there when his shift ended so the owner came out and took over and he was a super nice guy too.  Took the time to chat with us, to tell us the history about this place (neat story, ask him when you go!).  We will definitely be back for more!   Make sure you try it for yourself, don't put a lot of stock in the negative reviews (especially when they are about things like PRICE, this place is cheaper than some fast food Mexican places - and here you know exactly what you're getting!"}
{"text":"Guedos is great! Loved it back in the 90's and I am still in love with the place today! The shrimp tacos are awesome! We are a family of 6 and we were treated wonderfully! In fact I was on crutches and they continually offered help with the salsa bar. Kept asking if I needed any kind of help..No issues with a big order either...some may consider this pricey however you are aware of the price prior to ordering... walk out if it's not in your budget... totally understandable . We've all been there at one time or another."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! We planned to go to Backyard Taco, but they were closed, so we just picked this place last minute. We got nachos, tacos (fish, chicken & pork), and cheese crisps (chicken & plain). It was all super good! Our kids (6, 8 & 9) were happily chowing down and said how good it was multiple times. We all loved the salsa bar, too! One loved the green, one loved the red, the rest of us mixed the green and red salsa (YUM!). It was perfect!  They messed up on something and were quick to fix it. The staff were ALL very friendly and helpful. We got there about a half hour before closing time and they didn't once act like we were bothering them by being there so late. Another group came TWO MINUTES before close and they were equally nice to them. Super impressed all around and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A bit of a mixed review: So, the tacos were very basic. Literally meat and tortillas. The rest was self serve from the condiments bar. The quality of meat was so so. Some chewy, some ok. Salsas at the self serve bar were great and tasty.  The guacamole was nothing to rave about. It was lacking any spices and flavor.   Margarita was decent.  Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming(Mexican/ Hawaiian). You have to order at the counter when you walk in. Soft tacos are ordered al la carte. I think the tacos are a bit pricey for what you get ($3.25 each plus extra if you want cheese or avacado). We ordered two chicken and two carne asada tacos. If you order your taco with cheese the cheese is melted in between two corn tortillas. Toppings for your taco are not included on the taco but can be added at their taco bar. When ordering drinks at front counter the selections are slim. They were out of just about everything. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an interesting set up. When you walk in, you walk down a short ramp that is essentially where the line starts. The line leads to a counter where you order. Once you order, you get a number and choose your seat. It is indoor seating only. After some time, they bring food to your table. An alternative option, you can also sit at the bar and order there.  Where and how you order is a bit different than the usual restaurant. It isn't bad aside from the fact that the flow of the restaurant is horrible. It's dark and does not flow well, particularly the line where you order is essentially at the entrance of the restaurant. If it's your first time there and you're not sure what's going on, an employee will have to explain it to you. The employees are friendly enough and get the job done, but they did very minimal work and weren't very professional. The restaurant itself was dirty. There were crumbs and trash every. Few of the empty tables weren't wiped down. We sat at the bar and same thing with the bar. Random crumbs everywhere/our counter space and surrounding counter space had residual from previous patrons.  As for the food, the only thing I liked was the carne asada meat and the house margarita. The margarita was on the stronger side so that's always a bonus. The carne asada tasted very good. I got it in a taco which is served on two corn tortillas. The taco does cost over $3 for a single taco and they charge you 30 cents extra for cheese and another 30 for guacamole. It was very overpriced given that the base case of over $3 included only the 2 tortillas and meat. They do have a \"salsa bar\" where you can get additional toppings, but for that price, I would rather go down the street to another taco place for better tasting tacos. I also ordered a meat \"cheese crisp\" that was way more like a quesadilla. It was soft and didn't have much cheese in it. I had chicken in my cheese crisp and the chicken tasted like curry chicken. I usually like curry chicken....only if I'm ordering curry chicken. They advertised it as a \"marinated chicken.\" Needless to say, I was not very satisfied with the taste.  They do have happy hour but as far as I could tell, it was only Tuesday - Friday. I didn't see any deals for \"Taco Tuesday\" or anything of that nature. I'm not sure if the bar is a full bar. I would come back to this place for another trial, but there would have to me many improvements and it would likely be months or another year down the road."}
{"text":"Talk about a walk down memory lane!  We used to go to the Guedos on Val Vista and Guadalupe and the one at Arizona  Ave and Chandler Blvd.   Incredibly sad when they closed.   Walking in here,  menu the same.  I ordered the Pork Burrito,  one of my favorites.   Got my number and found a table.   Made my way to the salsa bar.   It all smelled amazing and familiar.  Love mixing the green salsa with cilantro and onion.   The meal came.    I was anticipating the Pork Burrito,  the Pork had an amazing flavor I had never experienced anywhere else.   My first bite,  I knew I was in the right place.   All I can say is delicious!   Service was great,  restaurant clean.   I live in North Phoenix and can't visit often,  but when I am on this side of town,  Guedos will be my choice."}
{"text":"BTW, for the non-initiated, it's Hweed-ohs, not Gweed-ohs. Guedo's is a standing favorite of Gilbert area residents and folks who work nearby. When I was a young adult (as opposed to now that I'm a \"older\" adult, boohoo, but I digress), I went here whenever I could, 'cuz the food was good and very cheap. Guedo's isn't gourmet food, but it's not Taco Bell. The fish tacos are the best!   However, the portions aren't what they used to be, and they aren't what I'd call \"cheap\" anymore. Still, there's those dang good fish tacos..."}
{"text":"I had their beef soft tacos. They were very simple but tasty. Rice and beans were good too. The only complaint is it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time two Saturday's ago to play trivia with a friend. The atmosphere is fun and the employee's are friendly. Ordered a margarita with the Mexican Moonshine and a chicken stuffed cheese crisp with a lot of pico(which was my favorite part...they put green onions in it). It's close to my work and is easy to get in and out of so I have also ordered to go for a couple lunches. Will definitely be back for more Mexican Moonshine and good times."}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes from this place.  I have passed it by for several months waiting for it to open.  From the street, you can't tell whether or not it is open.  No \"now open\" signs or banners.  I literally noticed it was open when I pulled into the parking lot.  Once I did, I picked up a couple of burros to go.  I was hoping for a combo plate with tacos, rice and beans.  But it is not on the small menu.  Burritos were small, but had a lot of stuff in them.  The flavor of the pork burrito was consumed by a heavy cinnamon flavor, so wasn't enjoyable.  My husband enjoyed his beef one though.  The salsa bar is cool.  However, it is gated in the corner so only 1-2 people could actually get to it without running into each other.  I might try eating here again, as the bar looks pretty cool.  The one thing I wish they had was combo plates so you don't have to order everything a la carte."}
{"text":"Mexican Moonshine tequila and the menu is actually labeled for those with Gluten issues! Much appreciated, thanks for that. Also.... corn tortilla cheese crisp... yum!  Best music and atmosphere I've experienced in the area, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had been to the old Guedo's tacos in downtown Chandler many times before they closed, it was one of my favorite taco shops in town. So I was stoked when I learned that they were reopening even closer to home on Gilbert Rd just north of the 202! I have been to the new location twice now and had a fantastic meal each time. The first time was on Cinco de Mayo, which as you can imagine was a zoo, but we still got our food very quickly and the service was just as attentive as if the place were empty. Our group of 12 people got a mix of tacos, cheese crisps (quesadillas) and burritos, and everyone loved what they got. Their house margaritas are very good, too! The next time I went by myself and just sat at the bar and got a 3-taco sampler and a few drinks. My favorite taco is the carnitas, the flavor they use is different than anywhere else I've been and it's beyond delicious! I actually like the fact that the tacos come \"naked\" with nothing but meat, because then you can dress them up with as much (or as little) lettuce, onions, salsa, etc as you like. Next time I'm going to try the Guedo Burrito, and of course some more margaritas! :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was six years old and Guedo's had never disappointed me! They recently moved from their original location, so I was concerned that the quality of the food would change. However this was not the case--ya!!   The building is much larger than the original and has ample space for seating, a full bar, televisions, and a kitchen. Also, I love that they now take debit and credit cards, so there is no need to go hunting for cash.   I came on a Tuesday, so it was taco Tuesday and all of the tacos were just $2.50! I ordered a chicken and a mixed meat. Along with a cheese crisp. The tacos were just like I remembered them full of flavor, spice, and they just melt in your mouth. I filled my tacos with some items from their salsa bar--onions, cilantro, and salsa. They had two types--red and green. They both were delicious, but my favorite was the green!  I wanted to keep eating them along with the cheese crisp, but my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach! I ended up taking home the mixed meat taco and the cheese crisp, but even reheated both were delicious!  I absolutely still love Guedos!! This is an amazing spot for not only tacos, but cheese crisp, chips and salsa, beans, and other items as well! Their drinks are also amazing and are half off during their happy hour time! Definitely stop by!!"}
{"text":"The glory that is Guedo's is BACK!  My wife and I have been jonesing for Guedo's since it closed in December 2015. And now it's back on the NE corner of Pecos and Gilbert. It's under new ownership/management but hasn't missed a beat.  If you want to order Perry-style ask for the following: 1 Beef taco with cheese 1 Pork taco with cheese 1 Beef-stuffed quesadilla with whole pintos & a side of chopped jalapenos. Other signature taco accoutrements from the condiment bar: cilantro, red salsa, cabbage, and a squeeze of lime. The wife also puts onion on her Beef taco. No raw onions for me on my Pork taco. Oh! and you're gonna need a margarita and a Pacifico. Tell 'em Dale & Darcie sent you. Then bask in the glory.  My review is based on the 3 menu items listed above, the atmosphere, and the customer service.... all stellar baby!  I can't recommend the chicken or shrimp. Your mileage may vary.  Ridiculously happy Guedo's is back, Dale"}
{"text":"It was great to see Guedo's Tacos finally opening their doors to the public.  I never had the chance to go to the old location in downtown Chandler but this one was introduced to me by a friend of mine.  We went there as a family this past Saturday night and while the wait was a bit long, the food was really good.  I had the beef tacos as well as a cheese crisp.  The meat was seasoned very well and the cheese between the taco shells was a pleasant touch.  What was really surprising was the price of our meal; the drinks were very reasonable and the entrees were the same.  I am sure that the ordering process will get faster with experience but I am hopeful that the new owners keep the prices down and the tacos yummy.  Here's to a non-chain restaurant that I know will succeed."}
{"text":"YUM! We love Guedos food. So glad they opened this location. The Nuevo nachos (6) are delicious but no meat (the (12) option comes with meat). The shrimp burro is definitely a favorite. The sauce is mouth watering and they really pack the burrito with delicious tasting shrimp. So good.   I took one star because of the setup. The register is in a strange place and people are constantly cutting across because there is seating on both sides of the restaurant. The salsa buffet is also in a weird spot and you have to weave between tables. Besides that, he food is 5+ and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE the food and atmosphere - we prefer to sit at the bar but sometimes the heat can get a bit extreme :) fish tacos are a definite must - the margaritas are good but a bit strong. Staff is always extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Food is great, ordering process sucks. Let me sit and order.  If I was reviewing based on food only, I would have given 4 or 5 Stars. The ordering process is so disorganized and uncomfortable it ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"My family and I are huge Mexican food lovers and have tried basically every mex restaurant in the area. If you're looking for the traditional Sonoran Mexican food that you usually find in the valley DO NOT GO TO GUEDOS. Atmosphere is like a island-feel casual bar type but food is awful. Tried the chicken tacos, cheese quesadilla, nachos, and carne asada and and it was all so awful that we ended up throwing most of it away and leaving to eat somewhere else. If I went somewhere like filibertos I would be prepared to leave feeling sick but this was triple the price of grease trap fast Mexican food and extremely disappointing. Bummed out about disliking this place so much because it's so close to our home, especially when it seems like slot of locals really enjoy it. 0/10 recommend unless you already know you like this type of Mexican food or you're just coming for the bar. Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland food. The pork in my burrito was dry and room temperature, I couldn't even taste the cheese I paid extra for, and the bean filling tasted straight from the can. The service was slow and forgot to bring chips. The restaurant is unnecessarily dark for a lunch place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The best tacos in the valley.. Never have been a big fan of tacos until I had a work meeting at guedos... Now I go weekly!!!"}
{"text":"New location is just perfect. Food tastes exactly the same. I think the pork burrito is my favorite. Give thst one a try!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for a long time. The new location is just as good if not better than the original one in chandler. I would say that the best thing is that it's authentic. But the best thing is the green salsa and pico . I always get a stuffed cheese Chrisp with carna asada. It's always made fresh and why change a good thing.  I could really go for one right about now. Also they have coke I remember sneaking in a can of soda at the old location because I loved the food but not the soda. I have had shrimp tacos a few times and I like them. And I like the chicken think it's a chipotle sauce which is mild and good too unlike anything I have had. So maybe that's an original authentic thing I don't know. I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Best prices for drinks and tacos. Fantastic tastes and a low key environment. They even have live music on Thursdays and a happy hour from Tuesday thru Friday 3-6pm!"}
{"text":"The entrance is definitely unusual, but once you figure out the flow of things it was fine. I did speak with the owner who told me they were working the bugs out regarding the area you order your food, so it looks like positive changes are in the works! I had a stuffed carne asada quesadilla and it was AMAZING.  The salsa bar was a nice change as well. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"WE walked in on a Sunday night, there was one couple in front of us, it took all of 30 seconds of waiting to order, they have a menu right in the waiting area so you can make your decisions right there as you wait so there's no holding up the line.  We ordered and it was not a hassle nor did it take a lot of time.  We were told to help ourselves to the salsa bar, which we did.  We sat and chatted for a bit and our food came right to us. The wait staff asked if there was anything else they could get us.  Since we were good and ready to eat, we told the lady, \"No thank you\"  I ordered a Guedo Burro with pork and a side of beans.  Man! that pork is SO succulent, tasty and juicy!  It was SOOO good.  Then the beans with grated cheese on the top.  That was an OMG side order!!  Those are SOOOO good!  I don't know who anyone can make BEANS that good!!!  Overall, we had an EXCELLENT meal and we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's \"taco\" about Guedo's taco shop! OMG.. :)  I am always on the hunt for amazing taco's, I have finally found them!! I actually never tried them until this weekend and they are by far my favorite, I've had the chicken and beef taco's both AWESOME!! and the stuffed cheese crisp with rice, was just as good. Pretty sure I will no longer be going anywhere else for Mexican food, they have everything I'll ever need! did I mention you get to dress your own tacos, salsa bar is on point!!!  Thank goodness its close!  I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Guedo's will be back in a couple weeks on the northeast corner of gilbert and pecos, right next to the circle k!!!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos!  I have eaten here 4 times and I want to explore more menu items but each time I got I just end up eating the tacos.  They are very good.  Excellent salsa and 'fixins bar' to top the tacos.  They also have my favorite tequila.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly and personable staff, friendly atmosphere with delicious tacos. They really do specialize in the art of soft shell."}
{"text":"First timer trying a new place...I don't like the ordering set up. The folded stuffed cheese crisp was tasty, but hard to eat. It stuck to the wax paper...which I'm sure I ate some of. I over heard other customers saying their food was cold and the manager came over only to say...\"oh good...nothing major then?\" My friends tacos were so-so. Won't be back Good luck!"}
{"text":"If you love real mexican street tacos then...do not come here...these are tacos for white folk. Now don't get me wrong the carne is cooked with flavor and love, you can tell But everything else is so much fail. First the drink horchata most likely from a packet was grainy and had strange taste. Second the tortillas are store bought and the beans taste and look like they are from a can. The sour cream is the kind you buy in a store like frys or safe way, not like the cream you find in a Mexican taco shop. The orange sauce that comes on the fish taco needs to be kept extra cold and only put on right before serving. Mine came out hot and did not taste good like hot mayo or sour cream. Only other thing that was good besides the meat was the chips they look and tasted home made. In all my years at eating at different restaurants I never left food on the table....there is a first time for everything....  One star for meat and one star for chips."}
{"text":"Fun and homey lil taco shop. Simple menu with good prices. And their refried beans.... Oh Em geeeee! Not sure what exactly they do to them but, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and were  disappointed, the girl at the order counter seemed confused by our order of two flour tortillas one with refried beans and one with avocado. Then missed my Diet Coke. The avocado added $1.50 to the tortilla and it was apparently spread on with a brush it was barely visible on the tortilla. Not the old Guedo's I remember so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked in a few nights ago.  There were about 4 or 5 parties, ahead of us, waiting to order and sit.  The restaurant was otherwise pretty empty with maybe 2 tables seated.  At the front of the line, there was a couple standing by what looked like a host stand.  They were ordering their food from a young server.  We waited and waited and still they weren't done ordering.  Anticipating a looooooong wait, with about 4 other parties ahead of us, waiting their turn to order and sit, we decided to leave.   They need a better system to get customers seated and ordering what may or may not be good food."}
{"text":"Where do I start...  The menu wasn't very clear and everything really is \"extra.\" We weren't impressed with the ordering system but it didn't bother us too much. I'm sure during a rush, it could be annoying.   I would definitely agree with other reviews that the tacos are overpriced. The food is quite bland and we left underwhelmed. My fish taco was drenched in sauce and the fish itself tasted like frozen fish. For the price, I'm expecting fresh ingredients and unique sauce...something different if you catch my drift. I do not recommend this place. There are other places with better food."}
{"text":"Really cool beach vibe and not the big chain restaurant feel. Way better than I expected from the name too. Full service bar, salsa bar, great food  I don't know how anyone can say overpriced,  everything on the menu is the same price as anywhere else and was really tasty. The server gave us a huge basket of chips AND filled it back up. My drink was never empty. Michael was awesome and very friendly. Gave us that neighborhood bar restaurant feel. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So glad Yelp helped me find these folks. Great service and fantastic tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"This place was awful. It was empty and the service was still at a snails pace! The vegetarian tacos are a mess and everything else is just mediocre. It's a pain having to get up and down a bunch of times for salsa."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place. Ordered a mix burrito,  chicken taco and horchata to drink. Each item was tasty. The mix burrito was cube pork and cube beef mixed into a burrito win other very fresh ingredients. Perfect. The chicken taco was good, but not amazing. The horchata was excellent, smooth and cold.  Definitely would try this place again."}
{"text":"Fish tacos Fish taco ......what more can I say they are the best. So miss the old location so many good times. I would drive from Phoenix to eat those tacos. New location for the newbies hopefully will grow on them. Living on the road now and just happened to be visiting."}
{"text":"Don't know if this place had an off night or what but the torta was terrible mostly because of the guac it had a very funny taste to it  Everyone thought so.  I rather go a couple miles down the road to Isabella amore for better food and salsa for a similar price and bigger portion."}
{"text":"Flavors are the same as before, very well done.  Counter service when you arrive.  Salsa bar has a green and red option, both are very tasty.  Also includes several freshly cut veggies.  I ordered Torta with mix meat(pork and beef combined) and it was amazing.  My wife had beef tacos, they come in a pair and have guacamole spread, very good.  We also ordered a shrimp taco, comes with chipotle sauce and cabbage, a little too much sauce for my liking but very tasty.  We also had a fish taco, it was good.  We also shared the nachos with beef, we are more fans of cheese sauce and these came with fresh cheese but they were loaded with beef, pickled jalapeño, olives, guac, refried beans, and tons of flavor.  Definitely worth a visit, glad to see someone brought it back,  Guedo's had been missed!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We were patrons of the original location and were so upset when they closed.   We just got their \"bulk\" amounts of food for the family and thankfully, the recipes were spot on. Their beans are the best and the mixed meat is the best option for protein. The salsa bar is great because our family likes all levels of spice.  Our only issue/critique is that they didn't have pint or quart sized containers for the bulk sized sides, even though it's on their menu. We were given five, six ounces sides of beans, when we ordered a quart. This didn't equal a quart and we were charged more than the menu stated for a quart.   This won't stop us from coming back but we just want to give our take on our experience."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos were to die for. What an explosion of savory and kick all wrapped up in one delicious tortilla. Corn chips were buttery wonderful, too. My dining partner raved about the fish tacos. This place was phenom.   I would pass on the chicken taco. While it looked heavenly, the meat was dry. It lacked taste, too, which surprised me.   We're going back. No doubts! What a hidden lil gem off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for great service, but i'm rating on the food. The chicken marinade is very different (not a fan), the nachos did not have much flavor, and the tacos only come with meat (everything topping cost more- $4.00++ for 1 taco, ridiculous). Definitely not worth the price. However, they have great customer service!"}
{"text":"The few of you leaving bad reviews are jerks. What's wrong with you people?  This is a brand new business trying to figure things out. The food is delicious and you're really going to leave low stars for organizing the serving. Shame on you guys!  You losers have no clue what it's like to be a business owner. I'm sure the owner has a family to take care of and haters like you always try to ruin people when they try and better themselves. You guys need to get a life."}
{"text":"I find myself going here more and more often! It is great for happy hour, dinner, and to go!  While waiting to order my food I always hear the same fabulous buzz about the fish tacos.  I have not tried the fish tacos simply because I prefer to be on the beach while eating fish tacos. I can tell you about the carne asada.   The meat has wonderful flavor and quality meat is used.    The Guedo's burrito and the carne asada tacos with a margarita are my favorite.  I've been living in Chandler almost a year and have tried several Chandler taco stops but nothing compares to Guedo's."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time the other night. The tacos were delicious and the salads was great too. It's in a strip mall so I was delightfully surprised to see how fun it was decorated inside. Our server was attentive, the prices were reasonable and the food was very good. They had live music playing and the singer was really good. We ended up staying longer than planned just so we could continue listening."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  I had the Guedo Burro with beef and it was really tender. Highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"So happy that guedos is been open for a month already.Great food and good service.Keep up the good work justin"}
{"text":"I didn't think I knew taco love until I ate at Guedo's.  Such a fun, inviting atmosphere with a friendly staff around whenever I needed something. Authentic margaritas and the quality of the meat & taco shells was beyond description. So excited they have reopened and I look forward stopping by whenever I'm in the vicinity. It's a good thing they are 7 miles away or I would eat there every day."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch is just a single chicken taco with a small side of rice and side of whole pinto beans.  Beans without cheese - the cheese hides the flavor of the salty broth and earthy beans.  The marinaded chicken, rice and beans are the perfect trio. And after eating, there is no lunch-after guilt (though most people should go for 2 chicken tacos - chicken is actually the best choice).  Every couple of weeks I make the trip from the Ahwatukee area to south Gilbert for this tacoholic combo."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas And Tacos!  You gotta try it! Cozy spot with friendly staff and tasty treats."}
{"text":"So glad to be able to once again experience those awesome soft chicken tacos from Guedo's!!  I've been in withdrawal since the original shop was closed.  It's nice to see that they are staying true to the recipies.  Love the new location (it's closer to me now)!!  If you haven't tried Guedo's - do it NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise so close to home!!   Great place to have some great Mexican food and very family friendly.  The service was top notch as well.  Would recommend it to anyone who loves Mexican food."}
{"text":"I got taco'd at the new Guedos!!! Same delicious menu as before. I didn't break from the usual order of a quesadilla and fish tacos. So good! Eat here if you like good food :)"}
{"text":"Not sure how you can have the word Taco in your name and not offer hard shell tacos as an option.  I've tried to like it just to support a local business and family but it just seems to miss being worth returning. Not a very inventive menu, value and overall quality average. I guess the word SHOP means it's not really a full restaurant and you should expect less."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. They have 2 salsas. 1 very very good and one just meh.  Burritos are pricey and not very big. Pork was a little bit dry.  Service was non-existent. Had to find our own menus and go to bar for drinks. Weird place."}
{"text":"Went here with my girl because I used to eat at the old location but the new owners mixed it up and the food isn't as good"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of standing in line to put our order in, get a number and sit down. The place just isn't big enough and I would have preferred they just took our orders at the table. We weren't asked if we wanted chips like everyone else. And I think maybe we were checked on once. We went during the Friday night dinner rush so you could see the food runners just running everywhere.  Once we got our food, took a bite of my beef tacos instantly brought be back to old Guedos. The flavor was still there so that made me happy. The portions were decent. And salsas were tasty."}
{"text":"I am very happy they reopened!  I love the Guedo burrito.  Excellent food, excellent customer service, and it is right across the street from CGCC where I work!  Win for me.  They have free refills on drinks.  Love the salsa bar.  I will be checking in here a lot!"}
{"text":"From the first time I came in to now the staff is just so awesome. They have always been so nice and understanding. They make sure I'm ok even with my gluten allergy. It has been a blessing having this place open up. The owner has become a friend. We come 2 to 3 times a week. I feel like I'm craving this place even when I'm not here! The tacos are where it's at. Best in town to me!!"}
{"text":"I underestimated how good this place would be. It's better than backyard taco, better than cafe rio, it's super damn good holy shat. I'm eating like a fatass. Ate a carne asada taco, a chicken taco, and a carnitas one. My favorite one was the carne asada. They have a salsa bar; I underestimated that too because I usually like burn your face off salsa but this was good without the burning. The house margarita was perfect too. Next time I will just get two tacos and then I can get a churro. Jk I'm gonna get a churro anyway."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the chandler location, and let me say the new location has still got it! Great prices, delicious food, and a great location!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! You have done a great job with the interior design. Bar is great! Love the salsa bar! Menu is simple with plenty of options. We ordered the Guedo Beef Burro! Amazing! We can't wait to continue to support our new local bar & restaurant! Thank you for the warm welcome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Friendly workers...family owned!! We'll definitely be back! Love the kids menu since one of my girls is super  picky."}
{"text":"Came on thurs night (5pm) it's always so dead in there.. but the food here is so good!  The menu is basic , the drinks are strong and the salsa bar is fresh. It's cool looking inside too. Get the soft tacos , beef !!  They are not little tacos either!"}
{"text":"The vibe here is weird - not very welcoming. Dark. Don't like the order at the register situation. The tacos were meh - edible but not satisfying. Salsa was fine but definitely not homemade. Beans from a can. And pretty expensive for mediocre Mexican food. $30 for two tacos, a cheese crisp, rice and beans.  We were hopeful it would be good but we won't be back."}
{"text":"If you knew the old Guedo's in downtown, guess what? It's been relocated, and completely revitalized. The food is great, ambiance is casual (and CLEAN!), and bar is on point! Margaritas, y'all! Favorite place to hang with fun people, cause it's comfy and cool. Also, recently got a bunch of tacos to take home, and it was still just what I needed for that taco craving."}
{"text":"Best Taco shop around. I especially like the mixed tacos with cheese. I get a side of rice as well. I recommend two mixed tacos with a side of rice. Three tacos if you are a little more hungry than normal."}
