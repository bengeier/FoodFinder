{"text":"A very high end bar for Laval. Very hot women and girls. Way too overpriced for what you get. A bit snobby but overall nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Belle soirée avec des ami"}
{"text":"The food is something to improve here. Its almost fast food, not tasty at all. If youre lucky you will get a good cocktail. The lichi martini wasnt bad. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Fun place to chill out with a couple of friends.The sandwiches are good. 
The desserts are overpriced but yummy, but what do you expect, it's a lounge. 
Great music for a night out and yes for you guys out there, there is lots of eye candy like the other review stated:)"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever for a reason 
It's a very nice Italian restaurant/bar where you can grab a drink or share a meal. 
My go to item on the menu is the chicken salad so I can't speak for the rest but my friends seemed really please with their meals. However I tried their beer-battered fries and they are BOMB
The cocktails are really good 
N.B: it can get very loud later in the evening."}
{"text":"Bar/ restaurant spacieux, moderne avec des grands écrans plasma pour regarder des games de hockey et une jolie terrasse pour profiter de l'été.

Le service toujours excellent avec de multiples attention et très rapide. 
L'alcool bien dosé avec de multiples choix de sangrias dont la Jet Set: avec lichi et vin mousseux. Le martini Apple Sour est super aussi.

L'entrée tartare au saumon : belle portion, frais, goûteux. 
Les calmars frits: croustillants avec une sauce piquante. 
La salade césar format repas est gigantesque! 

C'est une bonne option à Laval qui n'est pas située au Centropolis. Le seul hic: le prix est un peu élevé mais il correspond à la qualité du décor et du service."}
{"text":"I ordered penne and chicken. The noodles and chicken were underdone, noodles hard and chicken rubbery. 

I ordered the gin, grapefruit and raspberry martini and it tasted like Mr Clean smells, aka like floor cleaner. 

I ordered a top shelf long island and it was predominantly filled with Pepsi and didn't taste like a long island at all. 

I order drinks ALL the time, around the world and here both were either made with cheap and overly used fillers vs alcohol or very poorly made. 

Regarding comments of others on yelp, whoever said the alcohol is generous is flat out wrong. They don't free pour anything but the fillers. The alcohol is poured through a corded premeasument device behind the bar. 

I went on a Friday and it wasn't overly crowded. The place is a setup nice, club like lights, trendy music, dining type food and seating and cool bar. The crowd is early to late 20s for the most part. The waitress are quite beautiful. 

I'm giving the review one extra star because of the decor and friendly/knowledgeable staff, product served was 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very trendy, lounge and HOT ASS HOSTESSES!!!!

If you like night life and you want to pre-game before going out, this is the place to be.

Great atmosphere. Food is very good too. 

Best part of this restaurant, people. 
Plenty of beautiful people to look at while eating. 
Eye candies left and right. 

Mmm~~ Merci Bercoup!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a casual place to have a light meal and ended up at Univers, this use to be a place I would hang out in my early twenties, After almost 10 years I wanted to see how this place turnd out. I was pleasantly surprised, i knew I wasn't gonna get a gourmet meal but was surprised to get such a nice quality of food. The drinks were delicious and very generous on the alcohol. The food tasted great, and the waitress was very friendly and knew the menu well. All in all I was not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, but turned to garbage over the years. 
Now they've enforced ridiculous rules like you're not allowed to be seated outside unless you order food. Come on, the place is empty, and I'm not allowed to just have a drink outside unless I order you're nasty overpriced food?
The male employees make it clear to you that they don't want to be there. 
The female employees are all arrogant bimbos prancing around with their asses showing, to maximize their tips. 
The food was found to be subpar by the whole table. I barely made it home before their rosé sauce exploded out of me. I didn't finish my plate of chicken penne - the chicken was all fat and rubbery. The sauce was tasteless. 
This place needs to improve or die."}
