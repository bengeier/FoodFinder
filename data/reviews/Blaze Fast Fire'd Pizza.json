{"text":"Fast. BOGO coupon worked for checking in on app. Very cool atmosphere in restaurant! Clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Only been here twice and pizza is delicious! Their salad is pretty good too! Everything is fresh and service is really nice and the place is very clean and fancy! It reminds me of subway except it's better cause it's pizza"}
{"text":"THE ART LOVERS IS FANTASTIC, OH MY....I DREAM OF IT.  Hate to be a bummer buttttt, the salads need dressing on the side. I forgot I ordered one before and it was drenched also. Be back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"There is always a huge line during peak hours but if you order your pizza online, you can cut the line and get the food!! The toppings are fresh and the crust is amazing!  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am actually eating here at this moment. Never been here before, but I got a coupon for free pizza. I actually had pretty low expectations, but when I walked in the door, the person who greeted me was super friendly. Then the person who made my pizza was super friendly. Then the person who gave me my pizza was super friendly. How much are they paying these people?   For reference sake, I am here at 8 PM on December 20.   Anyway, the food exceeded my expectations as well. They have Sriracha for your pizza! At eight dollars for a reasonable sized pizza, it's not a bad deal. That little extra pays for the satisfaction of watching your pizza be made with fresh ingredients.   Keep it up, Blaze!"}
{"text":"The one in Tempe university drive has way better customer service and show more energy. The food is quite the same, very tasty pizza without a doubt!"}
{"text":"So, I have transplanted from Pasadena where the first Blaze opened and I nearly died seeing that they have finally landed here in Pittsburgh! What's not to love about hot, made to order pizza by a courteous staff? The build your own pizza is my go to because the ability to add a trough of cheese to your pizza without the staff even blinking an eye is awesome. Bing was the manager on duty and he greeted everyone that walked through the door and checked on tables in between cooking pies! It's so hard to find this level of service anywhere!!! Kudos to you and your team. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"Steve the manager, makes this place. The pizzas are amazing and the ingredients are fresh, but my man Steve, is THE MAN. He is why we come out of our way to this establishment. He is very friendly and welcoming. He upkeeps the places and doesn't hesitate to make sure the customer is satisfied, thanks man."}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients and overall taste far exceeded my expectations.  Was expecting something comparable to voccelli or dominos but faster.  I think their product is far superior.  The service was great for a fast casual style as well.  They didn't skimp on the toppings when I built my own pizza with a lot of toppings"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Marriott across the street.  I am giving 4 stars because I attempted to order online and received a invalid email error.  Tried secondary email and received the same error.  I called and attempted to order by phone and was informed that online ordering only. Spoke with Management and it didn't seem to bother him. Ok went on site new place from what I can see. The staff is very friendly and attentive going over combinations for pizza.  Bottom line great wood fire pizza and staff.   4 stars because of management's lacking a sense of urgency to fix online ordering app or offering a work around."}
{"text":"I received a free pizza coupon so my husband and I went to go check it out. We were greeted quickly and advised the whole pizza making process. The staff was very friendly and we received our pizza promptly. The house salad was very good also. We'll definitely go here again and we just received another coupon in the mail!  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go to the Monroevile location and always have a pleasant experience. This one was not the case. The kids running the show were more interested in socializing than paying attention to the customer. They would ask \"anything else?\" then look away to talk to their coworker without waiting to hear my response. After a very frustrating trip down the line we finally got out pizza (poorly thrown together and skimpy on the toppings). To top it off both my husband's and my pizza were burnt along the edges. I'm glad we don't live around here because we will definitely be sticking to our Monroevile location."}
{"text":"Super Pizza!  I received this coupon in the mail for a free pizza.  Not being one to let something for nothing go by the wayside, I took advantage of the situation.  Blaze's Pizza's are about the closest thing you can get to a do-it-yourself home-built pizza.    I got a pizza without pineapple, olives & meatballs.  Instead, it had artichokes, Italian sausage, feta, bacon, various peppers & sauteed garlic.  Oh, my, was it good.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, tons of options for pizza toppings. Lots of pizza for a good price. Went here on opening day (2 days before actually, a secret early entry) and they were very excited to help out and make great pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered on line. Per their instructions I checked in when i arrived at the store so they could put the order of 2 pizzas in the oven. Waited a total of 35 minutes to get the completed order. The cashier said she forgot to put the pizzas in the oven which why it took so long. She was apologetic and said she would credit the cost of one of the pizzas. That was not done. So buyer beware! Pizza was OK but nothing that was exceptional. Won't go back because of service and product quality."}
{"text":"Everyone must check this place out!! Their pizza is delicious and made with fresh ingredients, both times I've been there I've experienced nothing but great service. My friends and I walked in at 7:55 PM on a Sunday (not realizing they closed at 8 on Sunday) and while we were about to leave because we didn't want to be those people who came in right before close, they assured us they would be there for at least another half hour anyways cleaning up and were happy to take our orders. I can't say enough good things about the people who work here and their food, absolutely delicious I would highly recommend everyone who's looking for some great pizza to check them out!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. Nothing at all to complain about. Pizza, lemonade, and customer service are great! Can't forget to mention the price..awesome."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time ordering from Blaze. I usually order from Spinatos up the street, but decided to give to new place a try to see if it could live up to the hype that usually comes from a new place, but I'm sorry to say that it didn't. I ordered 3 of their signature pies: \"Simple Pie\", \"Meat Eater\" and \"Red Vine\" with added sausage. All 3 pies had a burnt halo around the edge. Not \"horrible\", but if you like to eat the crust (as I do) then it doesn't live up to the hype on their website's \"About Us\" page.  The \"Simple Pie\" was...simple enough. A decent, cheese pizza with nice, basic pizza flavor.  The \"Meat Eater\" was a disappointment in that the meat was scarce and limited to few discs of pepperoni and lumps of sausage. Not more than you'd get from a supermarket frozen pizza, really.  The biggest disppointment was the \"Red Vine\" with the added sausage - that was never actually added. It was clearly marked on the paper liner with the pizza (and extra cost certainly added to the bill) but there wasn't even a hint of sausage on the pizza. There was hardly any cheese either. It was actually not a pizza at all. It was a foccacia - like the kind you can get at Costco. So, 2 out of 3 pies that reminded me of something I can get from a grocer's freezer. Being that I only got 1 out of 3 pies, I feel I'm being generous in giving them 2 stars. I'll have to go back to Spinatos at least twice before wanting to give Blaze a chance to get their act together."}
{"text":"I have the usual 30 minutes for lunch, so figured I'd order online to save some time. Walked straight to the cashier and let the girl finish up with the guy currently paying and as soon as she was done, she went to make someone else's pizza. Took about five minutes before someone ended up helping me and after confirming payment, the guy let me know that my pizza would be ready shortly. I asked for a cup (since I ordered a drink and smores dessert as well) and he gives me a water cup. Did you even read the slip? In all, took close to 20 minutes which was just as long as folks that waited in line.   When my pizza was done I had to remind them of the smores dessert and it was not worth the money. Little bit cheap on the chocolate and ratio is way off.   Chicken is also a weird texture - chewy and mushy at the same time."}
{"text":"Great business model great service from their staff! It's always refreshing having staff members esp at a fast food place being polite and a attentive! Food is great I always load up my pizza ! Yumm !!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here today and all I can say is the pizza was GREAT! The employee's were very pleasant and loved the atmosphere !    Bathrooms could use more attention. Coke products, needs to switch to PEPSI! LOL!"}
{"text":"Great spot, good price point, the pizza tastes great and is customizable with as many toppings as you wish at one price, service is fantastic, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The options are great. I love that they have vegan cheese and their dough is vegan too. I'm only giving 2 stars because I've now ordered there 4 times and 3 times in a row they messed up my order. All we're online orders for to go. The first time they forgot some of the ingredients. The second time they burned the pizza black and still gave it to me which I didn't notice till I was home. The third time I ordered plain vegan cheese pizza and they gave me regular cheese and pepperoni. Not only did they mess up my orders but they never answer the phone to be able to ask them to correct it or give you some credit for next time. I called multiple times over hours and they never picked up"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Pizza is delicious, you can put whatever toppings you want on all for one price! I got every single veggie and cheese and it was fire grilled to perfection. The cranberry kale salad was delicious also. Even the blood orange and mint soft drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Blaze is a go to spot for quick eats that also allow you to satisfy any craving you may have with their custom pizza making process. I love the unlimited toppings and the stone pizza oven. I'd say it's a must try at least once. What bothers me is how expensive gluten free crusts are. It seems ridiculous how much needs to be added on for that crust. So the pizza is a good deal for the average person but for a gluten free person it enters \"expensive\" territory for individual sized pizza. I'd come here much more often if the gluten free crust was not such an expensive addition."}
{"text":"Great service with food that has value and quality. Unlimited toppings with an easy menu is what makes this place unique and amazing! Wait times for the pizza are also really fast and under 3 minutes! Would could back again especially for the meat eaters pizza!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the pizza other than the fact that the crust was pretty good but when compared to Mod Pizza (another build your own) it doesn't meet their high standards. I will have to say the desserts were AMAZING which gave them the two stars. Would I recommend? Probably not."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Subway meets a pizza shop. The pros it is quick and fresh, the decor was pleasant, staff eager, and price good. However it is not the same quality of ingredients that you will find a Famoso. Good for a pretty good quick cheap pizza in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you want to get a good pizza fast then this is the place to go. You can order either a pre built pizza or  built your own. Lots of topping choices. Of course they also have salads. The standard dough is thin and comes out of the oven nice and crispy. Also great customer service. One time my pizza was a bit burned so they made me a new one and gave me a coupon for next visit. Staff always come around and ask how the food tasted. Love this place. Keep up the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Pizza was bland and crust was undercooked for this style pizza. Really bummed since I live right down the street. I'm going to stick with 1000 Degrees. They make a much better Neapolitan pie."}
{"text":"Happy to see a Blaze on this side of town but wish we had a better experience! We stopped by here for lunch. Its the same concept as MOD or Fired Pie. I built my own pizza with regular sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and fresh basil. The pizza came out good but a little too toasty for my liking.  This location is fairly new so I'm sure they're still getting the hang of it, but there was nothing \"fast\" about this place. We waited in the line for at least a good 10 minutes, maybe 15, just to place our order. There were only 4 customers ahead of us and each of them had the same long wait. The staff could see that they had a line of customers but made no effort to speed up their process. Some of the staff was friendly but a couple of them had a bit of an attitude. I hope they get everything together and stay true to their \"Fast Fire'd Pizza\" name."}
{"text":"I wish I had gone to this place way sooner! The manager was so nice explaining my options and suggesting I get anything And everything I wanted. The staff was really fast and nice - even though I had come as they were starting to think about closing. The food was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Kinda on the small side, but good amount of seating. This is a make-your-own-pizza place, what they do is ask you what dough, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want! They also have salads, and desserts. You can download an app and pre order yours and it will be ready when you get there! They also have lemonade and stuff for drinks."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by here to feed kids lunch.  Great atmosphere, more importantly lots of toppings choices, tasty pizza - all for a very reasonable price.  Apparently they just opened up earlier in the week.  Should be a hit with the locals!!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza and have dined in and ordered out more times than I care to admit.  I load up my pizza with all of the vegetables it can handle, roasted garlic, and top it off with spinach after it comes out of the oven.  Yes, it's a bit soggy toward the middle of the pizza but if they left it in the oven much longer the crust would just burn.    The place seems like it's managed well and there's always enough staff on hand to make the line go pretty quick.  The staff is always helpful in making suggestions and taking the time to make sure that you know what/how to order.    I've downloaded the Blaze app and can say that I'm not too pleased about its operation.  I'm missing flames that should've been added and have not received a response from corporate when I emailed them regarding this issue.  I also don't like that you can't add a gift card to the payment options within the app.  On the flip side, Blaze does add promotions to your app fairly often.  For about eight bucks you can get your customized pizza which may or may not be leftover for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Great Concept and great pizza . Employees are inconsistent and need a bit more training as some seem like they are bothered if you want more than what they feel like putting on your pie."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I've ever had.  Ordered through Door Dash.   Only one of the 4 we ordered was edible.  Tried to get through to the restaurant but no way to reach a person."}
{"text":"I came in about a  having no clue what Blaze Pizza was (I have never been to one) and I had a very friendly employee show me the ropes. Basically its like a chipotle style place for pizza and its amazing. You get UNLIMTED toppings for free, and they don't skimp on toppings either. Tons of different choices of cheese, sauce, vegetables, meats, and even vegan options (which is really cool). They have a reward club where you buy 10 pizzas and get one free and the pizza's were really cheap as well for the quality!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for great price! I'm a simple man, I get the simple pizza. Less than $6 out the door for a legit pizza. Filling and flavorful.   I had horrible experience at cafe rio so I went to here because I was done taking chances with dinner. A man's gotta eat!!   In conclusion... pizza here is good but not huge. And stay away from cafe rio at all costs!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza? And the fact that its 100% personalized in front of your face? Amazing! The crew there was so friendly and it was just an overall great atmosphere. Absolutely loved it! Can't wait to bring my friends here!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this out for the first time. The employees were super friendly and always smiling. I was checked on twice while eating to see if I needed anything with smiles. The pizzas were 100% customizable, as in as many toppings as you want for no extra charges including the meats. They had a large selection of sauces, cheeses, meats and veggies. All for $7 something a pizza. And the dough was delicious!! Thank you for the amazing service and great food."}
{"text":"Really good service and fresh pizza for super cheap can't complain you have so many options and I love the pizza crust. Everything is made in house and it's fun to watch your creation cook right in front of you. The pizza is only big enough for one person but it's great for trying new things! You can do half and half or even one slice of something if your partner hates mushrooms it's awesome experience would go back again! Parking is close by as well for about 5.25$ , go !!!!"}
{"text":"Update: Tried Blaze again today and it was better than my first experience. I decided to go crazy with the toppings and get a large amount of them. This made the pizza way better. As expected, the thinner crust had a bit of difficulty holding up the toppings, but the flavor was very good. The sauce had a nice spice and zest, the cheese was creamy, and the meat and veg tasted fresh. I especially enjoyed the caramelized onion and artichoke. The staff here is also very friendly and makes the experience personal. If you decide to come, I would recommend loading up your pizza with toppings because they come at no added cost and improve the pizza vastly.   Original: Stopped in for lunch today, used online ordering which skips the line, but they don't fire your pizza until you arrive and pay. I like this because it keeps the pizza hot and you aren't left wondering when your food will be made if you order online. Takes about 3 minutes to fire up the pie.  The price is right on for this kind of food, about 8-9 bucks for whatever toppings you want. On par with Panera, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns type pricing.   The pizza is alright. I feel like if I took a couple of trips to perfect exactly what combination of toppings made it right for me, it could possibly be pretty good pizza, but still not outstanding. I got a variety of cheeses, meats, and vegetables on top, but the red sauce was the most dominant flavor. The crust is thin, which would probably lead to it not holding up should you decide to get a large amount of toppings. I did enjoy the crispness and chew of the dough. There was a good variety of choice with the toppings with some less common ingredients like roasted garlic, arugula, and caramelized onion.  Overall, the flavor of the pizza is good, nothing to write home about. The reason you would go here instead of another pizza chain is for the amount of toppings you can get without added cost, as well as the speed for which you could get it. Might be back to try the drizzles and other sauces."}
{"text":"Amazing Choose your pizza or salad the way you want it. Fresh veggies and meat all for one price. Freshest pizza I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Blaze is an awesome pizza joint to enjoy any time of the day with the family. I loved the build your own pizza concept, and for only $7.95 you can't beat the deal. Better yet you get a fresh baked pizza in around 180 seconds. If you like fresh toppings they have it all, I'm talking numerous meats, tons of vegetables, and more types of cheese than any other pizza shop I've been to. Sauces and finishing drizzles to add even more depth to an already delectable self created masterpiece. My pizza was cooked perfectly, crust nice and crispy, and didn't flop over when I picked up a piece to eat it. I'll definitely be back, my wife even wants to do a movie and Blaze for Mothers Day."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. Staff are friendly and service was great! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Lots of options and always a courteous staff. Love that they have pesto as an option for a base. Tough to beat for the price."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic vegan pizza here! They have vegan cheese which was so good! The girls who made our pizzas even asked if I wanted them to change their gloves since they had been touching meat and regular cheese before my pizza. I appreciated that so much! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and u can create ur own style of pizza with all the toppings that u can. Gonna be frequent visitor..yay!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A CLUSTER!!! The only reasons we continue to eat here are (1) the food is really good, and (2) we keep getting free pizza because they screw up our online order EVERY SINGLE time. I don't understand how hard it is to read down the list of ingredients that are printed clearly on their ticketing system. In addition to incorrect ingredients, their timing is a joke! My pizzas were supposed to be ready by 7:09. I didn't walk out until 7:30. It would've been later had I let them remake the pizza they screwed up. I chose to just eat it as is since my husband's had been ready for 10 minutes and would be ice cold by the time I got home. When I told the mgr this was the 3rd time they screwed up our order, she just apologized and stared at me..."}
{"text":"Excellent experience on one of their opening days. Every team member that I interacted with was pleasant and seemed excited to be working at Blaze. The line was long but moved quickly. As we got inside we were surprised with how spacious it was. Plenty of seating at high top and regular tables. Coke products?? YES. Also, their iced tea was strong and not weak. The beverage choices and quality is so often overlooked here in Pittsburgh. Pepsi? No thanks!!!  Ok, and so you are probably wondering about the reason to come here ... the pizza.  I was really impressed with it - I tried the Green Stripe, which was a chicken and mozzarella pizza with a pesto drizzle. I thought my crust was cooked perfectly, which meant that the bottom was browned and some patches of char in places. I didn't try any of the salads or the S'mores Pie dessert but they all looked good too.  Finally, in terms of value I think that Blaze hits a home run. Two people could easily split one pizza without leftovers and pair it with a salad and you would have a great meal at an affordable price.   So a balanced review is nothing without some helpful criticism, right? I am struggling to come up with anything so I'll say that I wouldn't have minded more pesto on my pizza but I bet I could ask for some the next time. Also, I tried a \"high rise\" which doubles the amount of dough. This was perfectly fine and tasty but I think I would have enjoyed my pizza even more if I had stuck with the traditional (thinner) crust. For anyone with sensitivities they offer gluten-free crusts as well for an additional fee.   I am looking forward to a return visit - there is plenty of parking, which is great!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good I've already been here 5 times. The guy with the beard, glasses, and backwards hat let us use a promo code when I was having trouble pulling it up on the app. I really like the selection of drinks they have (blue sky soda, aqua Fresca, lemonades etc.) Also I love that the calories for everything is listed!  I recommend using the app because you can scan it and get digital \"stamps\" for a free pizza and drink."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went to Blaze for lunch. This was my first time at Blaze.  Very friendly and it is fun watching them make your pizza. There is so many great toppings and sauces.  The pizza was very quick once you ordered it.  I got the meat eater and added mushrooms and tomatoes.  The price of the pizza's is very good and most important the pizza was so tasty.  The base is thin and very crispy not greasy at all.  We will be going back many times.  We still need to try ordering our pizza through their app."}
{"text":"Super delicious gluten free crust and fresh toppings! Staff was also really accommodating about checking on another usual allergy.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have gone to blaze pizza a couple of times since they opened. The times I have been there I have been amazed by how friendly the staff is and how clean it is. The employees are very enthusiastic and welcoming. The pizza is good and has a fresh taste. Great place to come in for dinner with the family after a long day. Keep up the good work blaze!!!"}
{"text":"The price for a build your own pizza (BYO)  is now $8.25 but still worth it!!!   I love the selection of beverages..different.  I also love that if you dine in and have pizza left over. .. to-go boxes are available on top of the counter.  Easy- breezy.  Don't forget to check in when you arrive for a good deal."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes amazing and the people are the nicest people I've ever had to deal with. They were genuinely friendly people and it was refreshing."}
{"text":"LOVE!   They were freaky fast.  Sorry Yimmy Yohns :) I've been to the other pizza place that's similar in concept but i love this one better. I got the app, placed an order.  The app was super easy to use, too. Got to the restaurant and told them i was there (they don't put your pizza in until you show up) and seriously, less than 5 min and they called my name and my pie was ready! Got it home, still hot and I dug in.  I got the pesto, arugula, garlic chicken pie.   OMG, i loved it.  I ate every single slice.  I was full after half of the pizza but it was so yummy i ate the rest.  I see what all the hype is about.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is bc they are willing to fix the problem when they mess up but the past 2x in the last 7 days I've gotten the wrong order. I order online and they get it wrong. I go in to order and they get it wrong. I work full-time and also go to school full-time... I don't have the time or patience to keep going back. If I have to come back in again bc of a wrong order after I get home take off my bra and get into my ratty clothing I'm just going to add their number to my speed dial.  Update: As I'm in the store my remade pizza is wrong again! What's so hard about ORIGINAL ART LOVER JUST ADD SPINACH. My god I'm dropping them from 3 stars to 1. They clearly don't listen even when you tell them to their face!"}
{"text":"Been thinking about Blaze all weekend leading up to my off day from work. Always satisfied here, toppings are fresh, I prefer the spicy red sauce. Also the original dough not too h any on the carbs. My favorite chain pizza place!! Service always polite."}
{"text":"Blaze is great in any city. I'm staying at a hotel nearby and was extremely excited to stop by. Vegan pizza vegan pizza vegan pizza. They have Daiya cheese as an option. And all the vegetables you can think of."}
{"text":"I invited my brother to eat some Pizza at Blaze and the service was awesome! My pizza came out perfect however my brothers plain cheese pizza came out a little on the burnt side. We ended up getting a discount which was great customer service. Keep on doing what you doing Blaze!"}
{"text":"Will update this when I taste my pizza...am at the Bell location now, waiting for my pizza to get \"blazed.\"   So, a few things that can be improved -  1. When sauce gets allover the pizza board, the girls scoop it up with their hand and toss it on the pizza. Um, so everything that has touched the board (other people's whatever) is now right on top of my pizza. Kinda gross to think about. 2. This place offers vegan cheese (hooray!) but the gloves of the girl who is handling the cheese was just touching chicken for the pizza for the guy in front of me. Blech!  It's crazy busy, as expected, since they just opened so I'll give them another shot. And the girls are all very young, totally fine, but they need to be told not to toss sauce that has fallen onto the board BACK onto the pizza. Just wipe it off the board.  Peace.   *****Got home and had the pizza...  1. Must be because the pizza is cooked so fast, but it doesn't stay hot. I had a 10 minute drive home and my pizza was just warm enough to still eat. Definitely an \"order and eat there\" place.  2. For a pizza joint that has unlimited toppings they sure do skimp on the basil. This stuff cooks down and shrinks. I had like, 3 leaves of basil on my pizza. Very sad considering the only other things I had on the pizza were cheese, tomatoes and pesto drizzle.  3. Parts of the crust were black, and I noticed this when my pizza was being cut and boxed, but I mean it's CHARRED. I know the theme is \"fast\" but do you have to blacken my crust so much?  CONCLUSION: The pizza didn't blow me away enough that I'd return just to wait in line to let grimey meat gloves create a veg-friendly pizza for me. I see the draw to this place, but it's not for me."}
{"text":"I stopped at Blaze last week for dinner! I was greeted upon arrival! When you first walk up, you can choose your dough choice. I went with the thicker crust. Then you can choose your sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies. They then ask if you'd like to finish off your Pizza with oregano or fresh sea salt. They then put your pizza into a fire oven and let it cook for 3 minutes! Lastly, there are \"finisher\" sauces you can have drizzled on top of your pizza.   Blaze also has agua Fresca, which is a total win for me! Previously, i was only able to find agua Fresca at a couple of other places around Pittsburgh, so i was super excited about that! I chose a Passionfruit agua Fresca and it was so good!!   I would definitely recommend Blaze if you like your Pizza a certain way. You are the creative genius of your very own pizza! It's like a Chipotle for Pizza!   Not to mention, the inside of the restaurant is cozy and comfortable. And they have takeout boxes by the fountain drinks so you can enjoy your leftovers later on!"}
{"text":"We love Blaze Pizza. The seating area is always clean, as is the actual cooking section. In the summer, the outdoor seating patio is nice. You pick your crust, sauce, toppings, etc. it's a unique experience, you should definitely try if you haven't already. The app offers \"flames\" earned for your purchases, after you accumulate so many you get a free pizza. They have double flame days and promotions often. They offer a gluten free crust as well. They also have a vegan cheese available. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful. We've been here many times, definitely one of our favorites in the area!"}
{"text":"Simple, good food. You can pick your toppings and create a unique mix for yourself. Restaurant was slow and a few tables were left unbussed while we ate our meals, so about 20 minutes of staring at garbage at the tables around us. Good for a quick bite, can be cleaner."}
{"text":"So delicious.  Love the flexibility that you can pick your own individual pizza.  Fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Create your own or order a set ingredient pie from the menu for a flat price. Thin crispy wood oven baked pizzas. Eat in or take out, similar to Chipotle style that you watch and build your pizza assembly line style. I usually get the spicy red sauce, fresh mozzarella, pineapple, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and some cheese.  No alcohol served and no liquor License , so get it to go!  The price point is good- $8/ person plus fountain drinks. A few desserts at the register like brownies and cookies.  A small parking lot, but the line moves fast inside."}
{"text":"Seeing the lack of routinely good pizza places. I was excited to try this place. I tried to order for take out online and the app. It kept rerouting me to their phone number. Tried three times. Then decided to call and ask if I could order on the phone. I was told to try online. I told her that I have been trying to order online but it keeps rerouting me to the phone number. She then said she cannot take phone orders and just try online again. Needless to say. I never had such complicated time trying to order a simple pie! I will not be looking to patron this establishment ever. Poor customer service. They would rather lose a customer than take a simple order over the phone because their online ordering does not work. On the App or on website. I give it zero stars but had to choose at least one to write this."}
{"text":"Reason why I'm giving them a 3 Star is because the sauce's lack flavor! I've been to blaze in California and it was so much better! I have no clue why the sauce here in arizona is so much different. And the bottom of my pizza was just annoying to eat because of the small Burnt pieces. I had their pesto sauce and white sauce which didn't wow me and red sauce as well just wished it was flavored more with seasonings. The pesto u couldn't even taste it on my pizza which is upsetting because I love pesto! Next time I'll just ask them to put more sauce because the girl there jst put a smear like a table spoon size. I knew she was new because she kept saying I'm new sorry lol! But overall, I will try them again."}
{"text":"I had heard about this chain, being backed by Lebron, and was curious to see what the hype was about. It has proven to be legit. Been here several times now, and apart from some minor gripes, am overall impressed and will continue to frequent this place. It's a great concept. Fresh oven baked pizza, with 40+ toppings, with different options of crust, cheese and sauce?!! I'm in!! And oh, it's the same price if you get 2 toppings or if you get 40+ toppings. For real??! yes! One time I ordered there and waited, the other times I've ordered online. Both are good systems, however, if you order/purchase online, you can save time by bypassing the line in the store. You just walk up to the cashier to let them know you're there for pick-up. You will still have to wait, but that's because they will bake it then and there for you, which is fine by me. Even if you go and order there, their system of assembling your pizza is pretty efficient and seems to work well. That line can be out the door sometimes though. There's a large dining area, inside and out, if you want to enjoy your piping hot and fresh pizza there. Good for groups. They have salads and dessert too. Minor gripes would be that I've had my ingredients messed up, some missing, some I didn't order. But, in the end, it didn't taste bad so I was okay with it. The crust is flavorful, not dry or bland, as it's made with EVOO. They've got gluten free crust, vegan cheese, veggies like zucchini, artichokes, spinach which you don't see much around. They have finishings too like EVOO, balsamic drizzle, pesto drizzle, arugula, etc.  Yep, i'm a fan."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place! This might be an unpopular opinion but I prefer Blaze over Una and Famoso. The best part about Blaze is that for a little under $13 you can get a \"build your own\" thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings, leave full and have a slice or 2 for later. For those who get menu anxiety or feel like BYO is too much of a hassle, they also have some signature pizzas.   Here's my usual order: - Sauces: (tip: get garlic pesto sauce on your crust!) and white cream sauce for the centre - Cheese: mozarella, parmesan (or you can add this yourself later) and ricotta (at first I wasn't sure if this would be a good idea but it was so creamy and delicious!) - Meat: Chicken, applewood bacon, italian sausage, pepperoni  - Veggies: They have a ton but I'm super picky, so I usually only do spinach (and lots of mushrooms!) - Drizzles: after your pizza is done cooking in the oven, you can choose to add some sauce drizzle (I usually do pesto and a touch of ranch)   I also always get a drink here (agua frescas) - they've got rotating flavours (my favourite is the mango and the blood orange lemonade)  Overall, I love this place. It's delicious and I think the value is great! The staff are friendly and there's plenty of seating (parking can be a little bit tricky however)"}
{"text":"Great concept! Awesome pizza! My wife, brother and I stopped for lunch and we all loved it.   Their crust is thin and crispy (you do have an option for thicker crust if you choose.) What we loved about it so much is that you get to BYO and design your own pizza. No more debating what toppings to get. No more compromising on a topping simply because your wife or brother or whomever wants something different. You want it? You GET it. And it was GOOD!   Service was fast and the staff was pleasant and accommodating. Unfortunately for us, we moved out of the area before Blaze opened or we would have been regulars here."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. We shared a fresh salad and dressing was homemade. I love all the pizza choices. I get the red Vine. The crust was nice and thin. Everything was ready in minutes. Very pleasant staff working here too. I recommend it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for take outs and even if you want to sit down and eat. Made to order pizzas with such a huge variety of toppings. Works well since my wife is a vegetarian and they have a really neat variety of veggie toppings as well. The service is fast and very attentive. I tasted on of their salads as well and didn't fancy it much but it was probably my fault trying a salad in an awesome pizza place."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is by far one of my favorite places in the area, the service they offer is always exceptional and their pizzas are always delicious. Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"This place is dope AF.  For starters, I'm thrilled that I can get vegan pizza anywhere in Pittsburgh let alone in my own back yard in Monroeville.  The employees however are the icing on the cake. They are super nice and accommodating. They always bend over backwards to bring my stuff to me as I'm usually with my 8 month old and they are so sweet and interact with him.  They have a bunch of different sauces and toppings to suit the pickiest of people.  They also have salads and what not to go along with whatever you feel like eating.  I'll def be a regular."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza. Got a veggie with tons of toppings. Marinara very good !! Very pleasant employees."}
{"text":"What a fantastic idea for this area. I've visited several times. It's subway like assembly line with fantastic choices for toppings. Get the ricotta cheese and basil. Delicious. The people there are courteous and funny. And the manager frequently will stop by to check on you.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall I didn't like my experience at Blaze. The staff wasn't very friendly and took some time to acknowledge me when ordering and when paying. The pizza was just ok ... the person that made the pizza stacked all the ingredients right in the middle so I did ask if she could spread some out to the edges. Best thing was the blood orange tea."}
{"text":"Tonight I checked out Blaze Pizza with my girlfriends and it was a hit! It was the first time for all of us being there. We all decided to get a different Signature pizza. We tried the White Top (which had a white cream sauce, topped with mozzarella, bacon and arugula), BBQ Chicken, and the Green Stripe (which was topped with chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, arugula and drizzled with pesto sauce). All of the pizzas are very thin crust but you do have the option of getting thicker crust. The pizza was pretty delicious and for a quick meal, we rated this 4 stars! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is like a chipotle restaurant but with pizza! The free pizza coupon def worked on me this place is really good! Staff is friendly and I love that you can add however many toppings you want on the build your own and the pizza is crispy. The pizza size is perfect to share with someone for lunch! Great deal and lots of toppings to choose from, tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast!  Blaze is the Subway of Pizza. Blaze is perfect for the family with picky eaters or just when everyone wants different things on their pizza. You walk up to the counter and have a choice of 9 different signature pizzas with various sauces and topping or you can build your own which is what we usually do.   The pizzas are 6 cut and run between $7 and $8 depending on which of the two crusts you choose. I always choose the high rise dough crust which is $1.00 more as it is thicker than their original crust which is paper thin.   After you choose your crust you have your choice of pizza sauce with include red sauce, spicy red sauce,  white cream sauce and garlic pesto sauce.  Next you pick your choice of cheese which include goat, gorgonzola, mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta and vegan cheese.  Then you pick your meats. Your choices are Applewood bacon, crumbled meatballs, grilled chicken, Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami and smoked ham. You can add as many of any topping you want at no extra charge!  Finally you choose your veggies. You can choose from artichokes, arugula, banana peppers,  basil, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, chopped garlic, jalapeños, mushrooms, olives, red onions, red peppers, roasted garlic, sautéed onions, spinach and zucchini.  After you have finished your masterpiece it then goes in the pizza oven and in about two minutes later your pizza is fully cooked and ready to eat. I usually give my pizza 5 minutes to cool down a little as it comes out piping hot.   Make sure you try the blood orange lemonade. They even offer salads and S'more pies, sea salt cookies and olive oil brownies for dessert.  Every time we have gone the pizza was delicious and the staff was always happy and pleasant but, if you don't want to wait you can order online via their website and be sure to download the Blaze Pizza app so you can score some free food!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly and delicious! This is awesome! Create your own or pick from a few suggestions. I picked the veg out pizza. sauce goes last for this pizza fyi. First Mozzarella and Gorgonzola onions  mushrooms and zucchini I also added pineapple. It's then dolloped with sauce. Paid got my drink and waited about 3 to five mins. It didn't take long at all. The place was very clean. They have soda and lemonade water and tea. Not in the mood for pizza? No worries they have some delicious looking salad options and I'm looking forward to trying one next trip. The dessert option is called a s'more pie. I'll try it next time I was in a hurry today, which was great that the service was so good."}
{"text":"Blaze is great.  Think Chipotle but pizza!  Its made and cooked in front of you un about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Update: After deciding to give them another chance, they proved that yelp needs a \"you ruined it\" rating. The pizzas were charred on the bottom beyond belief, they tasted of ash. Not a single one of the 3 pizzas I got were cut. Without a doubt one of the most incompetent group of people I've ever met, time and time again. Like I should've kept to the first time I said it, I won't be back.  The pizza is fantastic, some of the best I've ever had. The issue is the staff. The owner seemingly only hires unfriendly young adults who manage to make you feel like you ordering is an inconvenience for them. I'm not expecting a \"Hey, how are you?\", but there are a few that won't even speak to you unless it's to swipe your credit card and then they promptly dismiss you. Great pizza, great concept, really poor hiring."}
{"text":"One of the better Blaze locations I've been too. This location is clean and the staff are super friendly. What makes this location better than others is that they are generous with toppings and don't care that you want everything! Solid place for a quick bite. The only reason it's not a 5 star rating in my book is because there are better pizzas out there"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Can add whatever toppings you want. Very good it also doesn't have to be a thin crust which is awesome"}
{"text":"When I first moved over to this side of town I was so excited to see a blaze! Seriously good made to order pizza that is fast and reasonably priced. I was indifferent about the service, not exceptional, but decent. Who cares though when they have great pizza."}
{"text":"I got a build your own and it was so good (pepperoni & pineapple). The hubs got a meat eater and he was very happy. The teen monster got a simple pie and ate every last slice. That is unheard of with this girl. Highly recommend this pizza place. The pizza cooks in 3 minutes!! They will have beer in a month. Can't wait to come back and mix up the toppings."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously slow!!!! And EVERY SINGLE worker has a horrible attitude. We have come multiple times, slow nights, busy nights...they don't put enough  toppings and when asked to correct it, they suck theirs teeth and sigh...GET...IT...TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza Great Service!!!! As a first timer I got the thicker crust and red sauce and cheese and peppers and it was great. I was skeptical but it is well worth the try."}
{"text":"Very good Italian style pizza. I've been to Italy numerous times - so I know what I am talking about and Calgarians don't have to be jealous of Italians anymore!   We had the thin crust 'build your own'  with great fresh ingredients.  Many options to choose from. Very friendly staff and cool decor. Definitely coming back. Not inexpensive at 12 dollars for an individual sized pizza -but worth every buck."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price! Friendly staff ( although the young girls were gossiping about each other which was kinda annoying hence the 4 stars.) and clean tables. Would recommend if you're in a hurry and don't want fast food. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"My fav pizza spot in the West Valley.  Fresh, cooked to order. Nice chooces OR you can choose from the menu.   I usually get a made to order pizza with lots of veggies. They also have lower-calorie cheese & meat choices. Surprisingly, the pizza is made pretty quickly and rhe wait time is minimal. Eat in, order ahead or takeaway.   Also, their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Except for the $2 high rise crust upcharge, this was a pretty good fast pizza experience. I despise thin cracker like crust pies (new Yawker here) and nearly every one of these new age quick cooking places never offered any other option. Finally Blaze comes roaring into town and I was impressed with the dough for everybody's pizza done individually. This is a huge upgrade over everybody else and the crust tasted good and the prices were decent. The one-topping would have only been about $6.25, but high rise was two bucks more. Once you start crossing the $10 barrier at these places, it becomes not really worthy. Hopefully, the email discounts will offest the high rise because that is all I will get if I go back. LeBron owns a chunk of the company, but there was no crying or whining about my lunch today."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives. The customer service here is fantastic. A gentleman greeted us at the counter, and explained everything to me and my fiancé since it was our first time. He made sure we understood the menu and our different options. The food came out quickly and tasted really good! If that was the end of the review, it would be five stars.  However, that isn't the end. The place was filthy. When we came in, they weren't particularly busy, but every table was dirty, the drink area wasn't stocked at all, and the bathroom floor was covered in trash, including a couple of pairs of gloves, which I assume are from the crew either \"cleaning\" it or using the restroom while still wearing their gloves. Either way, gross. I want to go back because the food was delicious, but I'm honesty not sure I will"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting pizza !!!!! Fresh and all you can add toppings !!!! Our food came out super fast too. The lady making our pizza was very friendly !!! Thank you blaze!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Our pizzas were not ready when we came to pick up at 12:50. Our order was supposed to be ready at 11:45. Three of the pizza hadn't even been started and they had no clue we had more. Tried to talk to the manager and he ignored me and blew me off. Our group of 7 will never be back. Rudy I believe is the manager needs to be replaced or learn how to communicate with customers when the fault it on the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had seen this place months ago, but was sort of skeptical.  I was thinking ok, this is just going to be overpriced pizza and not live up to the hype.  People had been recommending it, and I had taken my son to Sam's Club, but they were close to closing, and they just ran out of any pizza he would be interested in eating, so I figured we'd give the place a try because I knew it was going to be quick.  Well, boy was I wrong.  I think it's price pretty fairly.  I mean it's more expensive than Dominos, or Little Caesers, which aren't that great tasting, but a good value for the money, but probably on par with a good pizza shop.  Plus you get unlimited toppings.  Of course you'll want to not go overly crazy with the toppings, but it's nice not to get charged $1.50 a topping like a pizza place would.  The pizza was decent.  I'd probably rate the place a 4 out of 5 for pizza taste.  What sets it apart is that you can pick a bunch of toppings and not go bankrupt doing it, the pizza is ready in 3 minutes, which is great too.  What really sets this place apart are the drink options.  They have all sorts of unique drinks I've never seen anywhere else.  I only tried one as we did take out, which was blood orange lemonade, but it was very good.  I'm kind of looking forward to going back and eating in just so I can try another one or two of the drinks.  If you have also been a little skeptical, definitely give this place a try as I don't think you'll be let down."}
{"text":"The white top pizza is the best. I also like how you can add additional topping if desired. I appreciate how the menu also list the calorie count for those of us that need to keep track of our caloric intake. The staff is fast and friendly. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorit pizza place around. The pizzas taste so fresh and there are so many toppings to choose from. You get a really good size pizza for what you pay for as well. Highly recomend this pizza over pieology or any other place in the area"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was really excited to try this place, especially when I found it out was like the \"Subway\" of pizzas - choose your own crust, sauce, and toppings! Sounds wonderful right? Well I had looked up the menu prior to arriving, and had in mind what I was going to order. One of the Simple Salad options was a Kale and Quinoa option. Listed online, however they have removed it from their menu. Say what?? Disappointed from the get-go. Second, I wasn't expecting pre-made salads, especially when this place appeared to be all \"create your own\". The Caesar Salad was nothing to write home about, with large chunks of romaine ribs making up the bulk of the greens. As for the pizza? There was absolutely no crispyness to the crust and the two toppings we got were meager portions to begin with, with several slices not even having toppings on it. On top of it all, the tiny pieces of chicken garnish one of my slices tasted anything but fresh.   Well what saves this place from being a lower rating was the staff. They were exceptionally friendly, thorough with explanation on the process of BYO pizza (we were newbees), and a staff member was ready to clear our table and provide boxes in an instant. I couldn't have enjoyed their hospitality more, except for providing a better product than what they had to offer.   Bottom line- Blaze Pizza is a very cool concept that fails to execute. If a friend requests to go here, I would not say no; however, I will not willingly be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Greeted loudly and sat down waiting on friends, a worker came over and greeted me again and cleaned the table again and asked if I was waiting on someone politely and made short conversation. Place is clean and inviting. Nice beats playing. The pizza though, my God it's delicious. Though I'm a cheese kinda gal. I asked for extra sauce and cheese and the sauce is so gooood! Highly recommend. They have coke products and a few lemonades that look delicious and my friends agree!"}
{"text":"Not good.  Have had better frozen pizza.  They skimp ed on everything on the pizza including taste.  They would have had to Triple amount of toppings to salvage the pizza.  Pieology is better and that place isn't very good.  I will blaze right past this place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the staff is so nice, came in because they gave free pizza coupons out but I will be returning. Such a great value compared to other build your own pizza places nearby. Definitely worth checking oi"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had a pizza and salad last night.  Feed 4 with FB coupon BOGO ON PIZZA with just $25. my boys used the coupon code 159.  each got their own pizza with  their favorite toppings as did my boyfriend and I.... no fighting over toppings."}
{"text":"Generally, I would not complain about Blaze because I'm a true fan. But, when you have 4 girls chit chatting and not acknowledging you, then, i must complain.   Business was very slow. I asked where I could pick up my online order. One of the chit chatters says to me \"you can pick that up at the register\". Ok, cool. So, i walk up and the only two people at the register are the cook and slicer person. Neither of THEM acknowledge us either.  There are 3 people waiting in line and not even a \"will be with you shortly\".  In closing, i find it rude that 4 girls chit chatting and two cooks who only had 4 pizzas could not say a word. Now that's what I call crap!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for months now and just realized I hadn't written a review. To be straight and to the point, Blaze is by FAR the best \"build your own\" pizza place in the valley and trust me, I've tried them all. What sets Blaze apart is their wide array of fresh ingredients and their wonderful staff.  Everyone that works there is so incredibly nice and always trys to strike up a conversation or make you laugh, which I really do enjoy. Give it a try, I can promise you won't regret it. Oh, and don't forget on your way out to get one of the cookies and ask for it warmed up.....these are some of the BEST cookies. Ooey gooey chocolate in the center with a nice sprinkling of salt on top, SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Really struggling with the stars on this one.  Pizza is great.... Great crust, great toppings, cooked well.   They have some great options, tasty sauce choices...will be back for the pizza for sure.   Service at lunch a few days ago was pathetic. All they do is take your order, ring you up, give you your drink and a pizza. Both times we were there they screwed up the total.  Two pizzas two drink should be around $20....not $30. Dude was seriously confused why I was questioning him.  Then a few days later, four pizzas and four drinks is not $60....most expensive item is $8.  With four pizzas this is mathematically impossible.   Ask for a receipt, check for the errors, stand and wait for them to fix the error while your food gets cold, and then go enjoy your warm food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try Blaze. We were lucky that it was Five Dollar Monday Night with the purchase of a drink. I was impressed with the delicious blood-orange lemonade. I tried the passionfruit fresca and coconut fresca but it was not my kind of thing.  The pizza was delicious. The next time, I would like to try a mix of the classic red sauce and the Alfredo sauce. My daughter enjoys the turkey meatballs. You can build your own pizza or try one of the signature pizzas.   The crust was slightly charred, but they trim it off. It was lovely!"}
{"text":"I got a free pizza in the mail so I figured I'd give it a go and I loved it! Everybody is always so friendly and the pizza tastes great. I've been back since and  it was clear they ironed out some of the kinks in moving the line faster. $12 doesn't get you much in the city and this is beyond amazing for that price. Will go back without question."}
{"text":"Love blaze pizza...so quick and workers are really nice. Restaurant is always clean. With the pizzas being cooked so fast there never is a long wait"}
{"text":"No stars would be more appropriate. I got out of my car at 9:40pm and before I could walk in, an employee met me at the door to say they were closed. I said, \"but you close at 10pm.\" He responded with, \"well we've been slow all day and we're closing up already.\" I told him to tell his manager that it was not right. He said, \"well, sorry.\" WTH?! Blaze ownership, I am very disappointed. I don't think the Wetzel family would appreciate their customers being turned away. Maybe you are \"slow\" because you don't put customers first. Very disappointed. I will be posting this on social media."}
{"text":"Last weekend I heard about this new pizza place. Next thing I know my buddy gives me a coupon for a free pizza.  So I'm pumped and I plan a day to go there during my lunch break. This past Tuesday I walk in and I am digging the setup. I started my order and they took the coupon and I went down the line adding ingredients. Before they put it in the oven I ask one of the ladies how long it would take because I had to run to the store really quick. The lady told me it takes 25 minutes until it's done. I told them I would be back in 15 minutes (which I was). When I got back I didn't see my pizza. I asked them where it was and they had no recollection of my order. I also want to include that it was not busy. I told them I was told it would take 25 minutes and they straight up laughed at me. I felt so embarrassed and was so upset that I had no choice but to walk out. All in all, after the service I received, I will never go back there. They were disrespectful and no person should have to put up with that."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza places around. Friendly staff clean environment great selections.. If your in the area give it a try its worth it."}
{"text":"I liked this place & went about once a week..until last week. The guy making crust went behind the oven & blew his nose with his gloves on! Then he went back to making crust. Wont be going there again!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Cool place, nice people, quick too and didn't break trip bank. I have zero issues and will return"}
{"text":"Make sure to try to high rise crust...it's the best. By far my fiancés favorite pizza. Build your own is a great option especially for anyone with food sensitivity."}
{"text":"Came with my free pizza coupon and I'm glad. I love the build your pizza concept and I've tried several other places (Mod, Pieology, etc) but I was impressed with Blaze because they have a better selection than some of the others. They have GOAT CHEESE! The staff were pretty chatty with each other but still managed to be friendly. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"First time trying, great toppings, their spicy red sauce was is on point. The cookies looked fantastic, very hard to resist. Had a blood orange lemon aid, had several other options besides soda. Great patio area for the fantastic AZ weather. Pizza was better than others I've tried at Pieolog around the corner."}
{"text":"Decent fast food pizza. Better than a Pizza Hut or Dominos but not sure that is saying a ton. Very kid friendly as the pizzas are customizable to whatever the kids want. Decent variety of toppings and they basically use a thin crust which I prefer.   Affordable, which you expect for this kind of place. I am a west coaster not sure how widespread this franchise is, but I would return if I am back in town and needed a quick pizza fix to take back to my hotel room."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great customer service at every step of the way. Everytime I have been there it has been a positive experience. One of the managers, Lisa, seems to be there alot and always checks on you after you get your order to make sure your happy. The beverage choices are all original and creative. Way better than the typical. 5 star ratings reserved for 'gourmet' restaurants but this place is pretty damn near."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing pizza. They are fast, efficient and a simple menu that is fully customizable. The employees were welcoming, even when we came on pie day and it was super busy they were in good spirits. The store is clean and has a good vibe."}
{"text":"We ordered take out via the web. It was simple and easy. It was done upon arriving to pick it up.  I ordered a pesto, feta, mozzarella, chicken, spinach, sautéed onions and garlic pizza. This is what I always order at Fired Pie so they were to be my comparison. The chicken was very very dry and had no flavor whatsoever. The feta could not have even been on the pizza because there wasn't even a hint of it. There was way too much spinach on it and definitely not enough sauce. I surely won't come back. I ate two slices and gave the rest away. My husbands red sauce half meatball half chicken , had almost no meat on it. He thought that it was OK and thinks Blaze could be a fill-in for fired pie. Overall I was disappointed and wanted to like this place because it is close to work. I wasn't impressed so I'm out. The spinach pizza pic is posted under photos."}
{"text":"So glad to finally have Blaze in the Pittsburgh area! The location is terrible (random spot among car dealers in middle of nowhere) but it's worth going because of the choice/options and the good service to boot. The decor is nice for a fast casual place, and the prices are solid. Now Blaze really needs to open a store closer in to the city. They're missing out on their core customers. Should be near Pitt, ideally."}
{"text":"This was only the second time I had eaten at a blaze pizza. The first time was at a different location and I was pretty hungry then. So, I enjoyed that pizza quite a bit. This time, the pizza was not very good at all. I got a regular crust, white sauce, chicken, bacon, mushroom, basil pizza with extra salt and oregano. The salt, bacon, and basil were the only noticeable flavors. The rest was very bland. They hardly put any white sauce on it at all. The other toppings were fairly sparse and not distributed evenly. The chicken was pre cooked stuff like you can get at the grocery store. I found the employees to be friendly. However, I'm not going to be very quick to choose Blaze over other options in the future."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is where it's at! The place is fairly new and I will continue to go here the atmosphere is fresh and you get to choose any toppings as many as you want any cheese and sauce you want as well as the type of crust you like as well"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is the perfect place to go for a picky family! There is something for everyone. I have celiac, and this place has always taken such great care of my order through glove changes, change in spoons, separate racks, etc.  Friendly workers, great atmosphere, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for our first time mainly because we had an online coupon for a buy on get one free pizza. We came in blind without knowledge of their concept, so we really didn't have any expectation. Even though it was around 5pm, it wasn't overly busy. The first girl explained the process to us, and we decided to get the all meat pizza, and the bbq chicken pizza. The girl that was our cashier was personable and overall the customer service was good. Although we took our order to go, we had a pleasant experience.  The pizzas were both good, with my favorite of the two being the all meat. I think that we would return and try different specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place last night, used a free coupon I had received in the mail. I would not recommend the salads, lettuce was wilted and just didn't look fresh and dressing was not the best so pass on those but the pizza is amazing. Love the SUBWAY style of choosing what you want and they have so much to choose from the sauces, cheeses, meats and finally veggies. Wait time was super quick they cook them super fast. Great location, very clean and great staff!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. The 1st time was in Erie, and I had no idea we had one in Pittsburgh until I posted about it and someone told me. It is fast and tastes great."}
{"text":"Yum! The concept is like a chipotle but for pizza. I went with the build your own and got the spicy red sauce, peppers, onions, bacon and chopped garlic.   I was impressed with the helpfulness of the staff and the pizza came out really quickly.   The pizza was a great size and really good. It was cooked perfectly and the toppings were great. It wasn't mushy in the middle which can sometimes happen with pizza.   I also had the mint lime agua fresca which was soooo good. It was nice to have options other than classic fountain drinks.   A special shoutout to the manager who checked on us and was super friendly. He clearly cares about the business and the customers and it left a really good impression on my. Prices were also very reasonable for what you got. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  Awesome customer service!  Clean restaurant! So many choices to choose from too!  Decent prices and Big Sky soda.  Leftovers heat up so yummy too."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!! The people were so nice and welcoming, I did a build your own pizza, the toppings were really fresh and a nice hearty amount of sauce! Next time I'll try the thicker crust for a few bucks more. I'll definitely be back in the near future! A++++"}
{"text":"For what it is... Blaze gets 4 stars for me! Their pizzas are fast and delicious! We went there on a Friday night and seemed to beat the rush of mostly families coming in to grab some pizza.   The ordering process is similar to Subway/Chipolte but it's a little more intimidating. They have a variety of pre-made pizzas that you can choose to order which is what I ended up doing. Maybe next time I'll create my own but this seemed like the better option for a first timer. I ended up ordering \"The Green Stripe\" it had pesto, chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella cheese and arugula. It was amazing! Chris ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and loved his as well. Another thing I loved at Blaze was their drink options, I was obsessed with the mango agua fresca! I will 100% be back to Blaze when I'm looking for a quick and easy pizza!"}
{"text":"We love this place premium toppings for a flat rate no matter what you want on it.  Hi quality with amazing flavor."}
{"text":"We were going to Costco today so decided to try a new place close bye! We were in the mood for pizza! I'm tired of Barros and NYPD so found Blaze! I read the reviews and a lot of good ones here on Yelp! We were interested in the concept of build your own, never seen that for Pizza! So we each decided to get what each of us like on our own! Of course we both brought some home! When they were finished no one called our name, but we were watching for people in front of us to get theirs! Then table sitting behind us said there were 2 pizzas with his name but they weren't his so hubby went to look and they were ours!  I think they need to talk louder or call out numbers or something, it wasn't even that loud in restaurant until they turned on the music, I guess next time we will wait at the counter! All in all we both liked the toppings, they were good quality, everything tasted good including the crust! Can't have a lot of carbs so being thin and done well was perfect for me! We will go back because I love pizza and to have it all done with what I want is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because they mailed me a free pizza coupon when they opened and I can confidently say this is my new favorite pizza joint. The staff was super friendly and they were quick & efficient. The pizza was a great size, especially for the price I would have normally paid. The pizza was DELICIOUS! I also got a side Ceaser which was very tasty. They had some drink options, such as flavored lemonade, but I did not get a drink. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We usually eat Blaze Pizza in California and we love it. Today's experience, well not so great. Every server making your pizza seemed well, like if they did not want to be there. They all seemed like if they were sad, maybe they were all in an argument before we arrived I don't know but they were not friendly at all. There was this lady that would call out your name to get your pizza, man she was GRUMPY!!!! My daughter and I asked for ranch and she was so rude about it. We told her thank you and she mumbled under her breath \"your welcome\" with no eye contact. The pizza was okay, could have been cooked a little longer and no sun dried tomatoes!!!!! What the heck!!! My daughter chose this place over Pieology which I love, I regret coming here and will not be back. Oh and the men's restroom was bad!! Hadn't been cleaned for at least a couple of hours. My daughter said the ladies room was very clean, lucky."}
{"text":"Pretty common concept of one price, make your own custom pizza. Typical sauces, meats, and various toppings to select from.   This location is brand new in a brand new strip mall on Bell Road near 7th Street.   To be honest wouldn't say Blaze was better or not than the others: Fired Pie, MOD, etc. fairly average taste no complaints for an entire pizza for $8.25"}
{"text":"Thanks so much bing for a great lunch(the awesome manager that took care of us)! Just went to Blaze Pizza for the first time. It was so good, this place is awesome. From the moment we walked in we were greeted. My wife, son and I all ordered \"make your own\" pizza's. I got the spicy sauce with mozzarella, goat cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ham and banana pepper rings, amazing. Then fast fired in their oven to perfection. My wife got a veggie pizza and son got pepperoni. Both also very good, since I stole a slice of thier pizza too. The best part is for how amazing this pizza is, it's only $7.95. We will definitely be back and will tell many about how great this place is."}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment 4 stars due to how over the top amazing service is. If you need accommodations made for a gluten allergy, they'll go above and beyond.   Blaze is a great option if you want fast food that doesn't feel or taste like it. Choose your crust and go wild!"}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place for a lunch date. As far as fast-casual pizza goes, this was great. Mondays they have $5 any topping pizzas. The staff was very friendly and the  restaurant was clean. Try the blood orange lemonade! It's to die for! Perfectly sweet and tart. Very refreshing!"}
{"text":"The crust is very delicious. The pepperoni slices are tasty and wide. The ranch dressing was good too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice & clean (well I guess it should be since it just opened !)  I had the White Top Pizza (white cream sauce with mozzarella, apple wood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula).  Sorry but it was very bland.  Couldn't even taste a hint of garlic and couldn't even see, let alone taste the cream sauce.  Guess it got baked all the way into the dough.  I did enjoy the little s'mores thing they have for dessert and the the 2 drink flavors of agua fresca (key lime mint & prickley pear). Both of the drinks would be refreshing in the summer."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright. However for some odd reason when you go there with other people your pizzas come out at different times ranging to about 20 minutes. Not sure why they don't come out in the order they are prepared. If you plan to visit you are probably better off going during a slow time if you are with people and you want to eat at the same time."}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite pizza place thus far! Their salads are good, the pizza is thin crust and reasonably priced. The online ordering system needs a bit of work since the employees seem to forget a lot of the stuff on the orders. Much similar to MOD pizza, except for better breading here than MODs. A little pricey compared to little ceased or domino, but totally worth the few extra bucks. The lemonades are okay ^ but satisfied over all!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for a quick, decent meal that isn't fried or traditional fast food. We've been to Blaze three time and each time the service and food is consistently great.  The manager is really working hard to establish a rapport with the customers. We were asked if this is our first time at Blaze and each member of the line greeted us by name as we went through. The toppings are fresh and plentiful, and there's a great deal of variety. The employees are mostly young students which is great for the community.   Will definitely be back...great option for the price!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  I love that these create your own pizza restaurants are popping up everywhere.  Blaze certainly did not let us down!  Pizza was delicious and cooked perfectly.  Service was great- everybody friendly and on top of their game.  Restaurant was super clean.  Fountain drinks were unique and tasty.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly and very good pizza. The pizzas are a very good size. Could easily be eaten alone or shared with 2 people if you aren't super hungry. There are a ton of topping options laid out like subway or chipotle and the staff is patient and helpful while you choose between them. The only thing that would have been better would be to have a smaller pie size option for kids."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places i have ever had. I love the customizable options. It is such a friendly staff and they really do take their time with you and its all done in an orderly manner. Plus the food is done quick and the drinks are AMAZING!!!! my only complaint is when im talking with the person making my pizza trying to order they cut me off and shout across the store to greet someone. It just seemed a bit rude.but other than that i have zero complaints"}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh and so delicious. Went there for the first time today and you can tell the difference between fresh and frozen for sure...so good"}
{"text":"Best make your own shop I have been too. Good crust, hot oven, great toppings. A must try."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time........LOVED IT !!!!!!! Very neat concept........pizza was unique and very good! The employees were all very very very nice........It's a cool place to go, I think kids would really like it- watching their pizza made right in front of them and the oven ! It's just a really cool place and like I said, they treat you nice ! BTW, the options of what ya want to do with your pizza are like, crazy huge ! If you can't find something you like........you don't like pizza ! Great place."}
{"text":"We have Blaze in California, was great to see them out here as well. The pizza is as great and about the same ambiance. Even better as they had a Yelp special, 'buy one, get one free' when checkin-in with the Yelp app. I was there by myself and didn't need two pizzas but decided it was a great thing to eat one there and take one home for later.   As I ordered the first pizza, I asked the worker if he could confirm they had the 2 for 1 special. He stared at me and said \"I have no idea\". Really? Hmmm, my mouth open, a few seconds go by, I said, \"well, could you check with someone that may know?\". Manager just happened to be behind him, so she confirmed after worker asked what the Yelp special was. We moved on.  When I got to the cashier, I showed her the Yelp special and let her know I would be using that phone coupon. Cashier agreed and everything was fine. I got my two pizzas (which is why I cannot give less than three stars, PLUS I luv Blaze and have always been a big fan!). Well a couple of days later I was going over my receipts and noticed I was charged for two pizzas instead of one. I called and talked to the manager, let her know what happened with the first employee, then again the second mistake at the cashier. I explained due to the mistakes, the two workers may not have been properly trained. It was minimized, no prob. We agreed she would correct after talking to a higher manager working in a different market, took my number and said she would call back. Well I never got a call back, but fortunately I checked my credit card online about a week later and I was indeed credited the amount.   A few suggestions to management: your staff may need a little more training, which is why these mistakes happen. But the bigger problem is you don't want your employees responding \"I have no idea\" when a customer asks a question. It's unprofessional and just another way of saying \"I don't give a sh*t\"."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was very pleased with the service and quality. The pizza is made fairly quickly and the best part is making it the way you want it. I ordered the ART pizza and it was delicious and my companion  had the BBQ pizza and added other toppings with no extra charge. Don't pass up their blood orange lemonade...it's  great!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza. This review could be about any of the three or four franchises I have dined at around the country, but it is specific to the one in Pittsburgh I visited. I really like Blaze because their gluten-free crusts are among the best I have had. And the ability to either customize your pizza, or order one of their standard offerings, is great.  In Pittsburgh, I chose the Veg Out option -- fresh vegetables included broccoli, camelized onions and more. It was delicious, ready for pickup at the time I ordered it, and the staff was friendly. When I do travel, I like to check out non-chain restaurants. However, Blaze Pizza will be among the few go-to chains I will visit whenever possible."}
{"text":"Such good pizza.  Everything is so very fresh and the options are endless. They make each pizza fresh right there in front of you."}
{"text":"Blaze is truly one of a kind! It's not gourmet pizza nor is it by any means the best I've tasted, but for open-flamed pizza accompanied by fresh salads, it's right up there! Why is it good? You can make your own right as you file down the line to select exactly what you desire. Out of about 50 toppings, anyone can get what they want with such ease as to be outstanding. We've been frequenting Blaze for a few years now when we want something fast and super tasty and nutritious, and well, what more can I say? Two tomato-based sauces and one each of pesto and white, many cheeses to choose from (incl. non-dairy), sausages & pepperoni & ham, fresh greens like arugula, spinach, basil & broccoli, garlic and olives, and ... and ... and. No one need walk away without feeling both filled and satisfied.  As well, you can order the regular thin crust, double the dough to fatten it up, or ask for gluten-free, for which they will change their gloves for you. As their gas-fired oven means the crust is moist but not oily, 'tis hand-held eating just about as good as it gets. Drinks and salads fill out your order...  One serious downside is no card-based tipping system: not sure why, but the staff and product deserve a voluntary online tip: not long ago I ordered 15 pizzas all at once without prior notice, and their staff filled it with relative ease. To not give them a sizable tip is dumb, but without cash they got zip. Maybe Lebron James can help with that.  Oh yes, I understand they toss all the salads in the middle of the day and re-stock with fresh, and regularly temperature-test all ingredients so that everything stays free from nasties! Pretty cool, eh? Flame-fired pizza kinda ensures flavour, doesn't it. Add olive oil, bbq, balsamic, and other spicy ends to top it all off and eat the whole thing right in front of your friends. Why? It's only about $12.85 per pizza!  And they all will likely want their own.  At this price, bringing the whole family works well. In fact, if you ask, they will split the same pizza into two sides with different ingredients so that your kids and other small-eaters are all pleased. As well as online orders, take-out also is possible.   In 10 minutes you can be eating one of the better pizzas on the continent. Oh yes, it's spreading across all parts of North America. Why so good? You helped create it!"}
{"text":"This is my first trip to a Blaze Pizza, and I have to say I was very impressed. The quality is outstanding! The speed and efficiency will blow your mind. I was able to order and sit down with my pizza and drink (pizza made in front of me in line mind you) in less than ten minutes.   If you have access to Blaze Pizza give them a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing. 100% everything you'd want in a fast food pizza place. 10\"pizzas personally prepared to your liking and unlimited toppings is key. The pizzas were beautiful and everyone was extremely pleasant. The place was packed when we arrived around 8. I got a white pizza with veggies and tried the gluten free crust, and my husband got some sausage with a red sauce and traditional crust. They even asked if I wanted them to change their gloves with the gluten free pie. So considerate, and I've never been asked this before, although my gluten free crust was a preference and not due to allergy.  Several of the male workers fist-bumped my husband and started convo with us about it being our first time here. The manager checked in at our table and asked how we enjoyed our food, making the experience more personable. I LOVED the minced and roasted garlic toppings available. I only wish the minced would be fresh, because you can tell it's from a jar. There are also red peppers, oregano, and cheese containers you can take to your table, if you'd like. They had --easily --a dozen people working there. And I think that's what kept the line rolling along so quickly.  My only gripe would be that one of the waitresses was causing a scene because she had to stay until 830. Her mom was in line and the girl was pretty vocal about wanting to leave, which was disruptive. She was even rude to her co workers and I want to give them a shout out for handling this in a professional manner. I am still keeping 5 stars because they didn't let her interfere with their work.   We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to get quick, personalized, great tasting, and cheap pizza (under $9)! Don't forget to check in on Yelp so you get the buy one get one special! Also, the restaurant app gives you a free beverage too! We will for sure be stopping back the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Actually,  I would give this place 4 1/2 stars if I could. Love this concept and this pizza. I love that I can order anything I want for one price and a reasonable price at that! Everything is fresh and tasty. So many different options for everyone. I love the balsamic glaze and goat cheese. I can't wait to go back again and try a different pizza.   This was our first time here and it was hard to decide what to order with so many options. Decisions...decisions.... I finally chose a white pizza with sausage, peppers, veggies, roasted garlic, both goat and mozzerella cheeses and topped it off with some balsamic glaze. It was fabulous! The hubby ordered the spicy red sauce with all the meats, peppers and several cheeses. It was also very good for those who like some heat.  I also sampled the aqua fresca which was a nice change from typical sodas. I got the prickly pear and it was delicious and refreshing. I would absolutely order it again.  We are still devoted Aiello's and Fiori's fans, but this Blaze pizza is now in our top 5 for sure and will be our \"go to\" place when in the area and in the mood for pie."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza gets 5 Stars for the combination of quality and value. Thanks to everyone's suggestion, we checked in on yelp for the free pizza with the purchase of a regular priced pizza. Delicious thin crust pizza for two people for less than $10 - that's crazy. One pizza should be enough for a single person if you're hungry.   We chose to go with a couple signatures since this was our first time, but you can certainly BYO (build your own) by choosing any toppings you want. We went with the Meat Eater (pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella, red sauce) and the White Top (white cream sauce with mozzarella, applewood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula). All of the ingredients were fresh - I loved the tomato sauce, just gave the whole pizza a great vibe.  Their process helps to keep the crust crispy for you as you wait for your pizza. Once the pie comes out of the oven, the pizza is rested on a cookie sheet before cutting. If you hate getting soggy pizza as your first bite, Blaze does a good job of minimizing that for you.  As far as chains go, this gets my thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once but my three year daughter absolutely loved it. She really enjoyed watching her pizza be made and being able to pick what goes on it. Also they press the fresh dough with a machine right in front of you which is neat to see. I, on the other hand, (as an advid couponer), loved the BOGO coupon upon Check-in. To be honest, it is what brought us in to begin with. However, even witbout a coupon the prices are great. The pizza was really good, but my favorote thing was the arugula salad. We will definitely be back next time were in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh ingredients prepared quickly, with plenty of options for all dietary needs.  My only request would be a vegetarian protein, like tofu or cashews. Otherwise I'm very pleased, and have consistently had good experiences here."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is amazing. But some of the workers need to learn how to put toppings on a pizza with consistency. Sometimes when I come here the the pizza is great! But other times, most times, the pizza is soggy, doughy and not cooked all of the way through. It's not like the place is busy and they are being rushed, either. This place just needs some work and it could be great. It's a shame because it's decently new and should not be having these issues."}
{"text":"I did not get to eat here today, but it was for good reasons. Today was Pi day, and Blaze was one of the only pizza places which generously offered a real good special. The place was crowded... It was a 2 hour wait but they gave each one of their clients a Pi-e for only $3.14. I drove nearly 30 min down to get a taste of the promo, but I just had to stay outside. I don't do well with long lines. I would have forgotten after 2 hrs why I was even on the line for, that's way too long for me. I will add the last star after I get to eat their pizza, so I hope I get to it, but I even hope more that those who did get a chance to get the pie give this biz a well deserved rating, because we need more places doing this kind of promotions, not only on Pi day, but here and there, everday. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I love this place but listen the guy with the black \"chef jacket\" and backwards hat with the buttons all over, we know you hate your job ok it's written all over your face but you are getting paid to be at work so put a smile on your face and stop throwing everything around and tell the customer thank you have a good night or something instead of just being rude with a mean mug on your face. Go get a different job if you don't like customer service.   Update: he can't even cut the pizza right. A little less than half the pizza was one giant slice. WOW."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was immediately greeted by the staff. Of course the pizza was delicious! Not to mention, the store was very clean and organized."}
{"text":"Received an offer to get a free pizza from Promo card Blaze had sent out. Went in and they had alot of variety. All ingredients are fresh and the Pizza was delicious. it's not the typical Pizza & Wings joint, but definitely is a great spot. Must try ! All staff very friendly"}
{"text":"When's the last time you had pizza with unlimited toppings that didn't make your wallet cry?   It's been too long, come to Blaze.   Ask for high rise if you like regular (not thin) crust. Plenty of sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies to choose from. Make sure you plan your finishing sauce (it's included!).   Now splurge on dessert- for only $2 you can't go wrong: S'more Pie, sea salt chocolate chip cookie, or brownie-- they are all delicious. You can have your dessert warmed by the fire too! (Do it!)  Everyone was friendly, but an Lisa hooked us up and had us feeling extra special."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Blaze. Let's get this right - the pizza was delicious. The main reason is because of the red sauce. It was very savory. I'll be sure to ask for extra next time... if there is a next time. The place was fairly busy but not overloaded. The line wasn't too long. However, it took a long time to get through the ordering to the cashier. I watched the pizzaiolo on the oven carefully as I hate burned crust. My pizza was thrown in the last of six at the time. My luck that she maneuvered all the other pizzas as they baked except for mine. She got distracted. As she took them out one by one I anxiously waited as mine continued to get darker and darker. In my opinion she was too busy doing all kinds of other things besides watching the pizzas. Fortunately she took mine out and it didn't appear too bad. But a couple of the pizzas she took out after mine were burnt enough that she had to trim the edges. Having said all that, the service was friendly enough. I just wouldn't go during lunch or whenever you're in a hurry. Maybe try their phone app to order ahead of time. I might go back."}
{"text":"Like pizza that is the perfect size and fully customizable?! Then this is the joint!   Blaze is a chain that has recently popped in arizona and it's quickly becoming a favorite. They cook their pizza at 700 degrees and it's quick and convenient.   My favorite is the white top because I love pizza sauces that go away from the traditional tomato sauce. The toppings blended well together, even the arugula (usually not a fan of)  The prices are reasonable and the pizza is the perfect size for one or 2...Depending on how hungry you are. Now go make a masterpiece out of your pizza and enjoy every scrumptious morsel."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Fast and friendly people. The value for the money is unreal. Clean and newly remodeled building. The pizza is ready so fast. I am hooked. Thanks."}
{"text":"Tasty fast pizza.  I love how you can put as many toppings on that you want.   The pizza was a little burned. But that is to be expected.   The service was very friendly.   We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If you want to get blazed.. blaze pizza is the spot to be!! They hook it up with some FIRE pizza fressshh out of the FIRE oven... fireeee!  This place is fast and efficient with great service."}
{"text":"Me and my wife enjoyed it! Not the cheapest pizza but u pay for what you get , they have unlimited possibilities how you want your pizza and its quick ! Will go back"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is a pretty great place. You get to make your own pizza. I love the spicy red sauce, pesto is good too. Would not recommend their white sauce, its kinda bland. They have a wide variety of toppings to choose from. Its a clean place. Would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Everyone has that friend who likes a place so much they won't shut their pie holes about it. They'll ride you till you say \"OK! OK! I'll try the damn place\" and when you do, it's either \"yeah it's pretty good\" or you just mumble some obscure response because you know, you'll be asking for a pounding if you badmouth your friend's joint. Either way, you didn't see what the big deal was all about.  Well let me tell you something, that'll NEVER be me because 1. BLAZE PIZZA IS THE SHIZZZZZZ 1a. I'LL BE SAYING \"THE SHIZZZZZZ\" AS LONG THE HIP HOP ARTISTS WHO COINED THIS TERM ARE STILL ALIVE 2. I  DONT GIVE POUNDINGS I GIVE HIGH FIVES 3. THANK YOU LEBRON JAMES FOR (helping to) BRINGING BLAZE PIZZA TO THE WORLD  I could go into great details about how great blaze is but forget it, I'd rather spend my time visiting this place for the...crap I lost count.  Hell I know pizza the pizza game in town. Hell I've been all over the world and had the best slices. I know my New York folds, my pizzetti's and the zza culture of this planet. I'm not some chump you can pass for not knowing anything about pizza. Blaze is one of the best!"}
{"text":"I love the $8 build you own pizza. Lots of toppings to choose from and everything is fresh. Service is always outstanding especially from Bing who really takes care of his customers. I am happy to see this place is doing so well."}
{"text":"I was there on opening day early. No line and the service was outstanding. So friendly. Every single team member said hello and asked how we were doing. I had more toppings on a pizza than I ever had and it was great!.  My grandkids are coming for a weeklong visit and Blaze pizza is one the \"attractions\" we'll be taking them to. Also, can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Met a friend at Blaze for pizza and long chat and was super amazed at how tasty this pizza is.  The counter staff is great explaining how it works and the quality and flavor was perfect!  The place wasn't super noisy either so we could chat without shouting, which is often rare at casual dining places.  Definitely a great inexpensive eatery!"}
{"text":"Great, Fast Pizza. I love that you can get spicy sauce as well as goat cheese and many other great toppings. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice & clean (opened 2 weeks ago I'm told)  I had the White Top Pizza (white cream sauce with mozzarella, apple wood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula).  Sorry but it was very bland.  Couldn't even taste a hint of garlic and couldn't even see, let alone taste the cream sauce.  The first one was burned black on the bottom. I didn't understand that you could get more free toppings (since that was on the menu board under Build your own, I didn't think it applied to the White Top.  I'm told you can get tomatoes and mushrooms which would have been good.  The second re-do came out undercooked and way too much sea salt given it already has bacon.   I got offered a free pizza coupon to come again.  I mixed the blood orange drink with 1/3 lemon at the soda area.  It was perfect.  I was told that the blood orange alone is too sweet.  I also had the Beet and goat cheese salad.  I liked that.  Generous sizes on the salads.  I might go again but there is better pizza out there.  For one, you must like thin crust pizza (so it can cook in 5 minutes).  two people in our party ordered the thick - It is not thicker, only slightly more crust at the edges.  They are very scotch at this location with the amount of sauce.  Max group seating is 6. we added a chair from another table for 7.  If 8 had been able to come we'd have been SOL since the tables are unmovable for rearranging for groups.  There are booths in the back that each can seat 6. That might accomodate 12 - 14 if you were able to et both.  We thought for being a new place it would have been busier in such a well traveled shopping center location next to Panera, movie theatre, grocery, etc. Decor is industrial lighting, seating, orange elements, a bit rustic.  Is that trendy? Average bill with pizza, salad and drink $15"}
{"text":"This place just opened down the street from my apartment so I went to check it out. I'm pretty familiar with the build-your-own pizza concept, as it's all over the city (Fired Pie, Pieology, etc)  Blaze has all of them beat. The regular crust is crispy without being burnt or cracker-like, and the regular red sauce has quite the kick!"}
{"text":"The only things I truly like about Blaze are the BOGO offers and coupons, and the unique drink selection. Staff is unorganized and rude. None of them seem to want to be there. I am a vegetarian and have to ask them to change their gloves before making my pizza, as the meats come before the veggies and cheese on the line - they always seem annoyed by this which irritates me. The ingredients used are mediocre when it comes to quality, though the selection to choose from is nice. Blaze is almost always packed with people & very busy. I have had my order messed up on 2-3 different occasions as well. I do believe that management could easily fix these issues & make Blaze a much better place to eat if they care to."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 I wanted to try this franchise place out as it had a neat concept of build your own pizza plus it was highlighted on YouTube by these  two LA foodies who review different types of food at three price points.  They did one episode on pizza and Blaze Pizza was their low price point pizza  places but still rated really well. So I gave the meat lovers pizza a try and added banana peppers and Cherry tomatoes.  I didn't want to mess up their preset signature pizza ingredients too much as I wanted to see what it was like.  Crust is thin crust.  Chewy yet crisp.  I liked it.  The toppings and sauce were good to above average.  Waiting time was longer than expected as I was in line with the order for about 10 - 15 minutes with half a dozen pizzas to be assembled ahead of me.  Then once your pizza is built it takes another 10 minutes to bake.  So you could be in there for 20-25 minutes before getting your pizza if there is a small lineup. Overall I liked the food and concept.  They offer various fresh lemonades in addition to the standard pop choices. I think I'll have to try it again  to see what a personally built pizza might taste like.  You can throw on as much toppings as you care for.  Guessing if you load up to get quantity,  the quality and taste gets diminished unless you know what you are doing. Nice change from Pizza Hut.  For thin crust lovers might be worth trying. For me I prefer the thick crust offered by traditional places like Michaels which are gooey cheese goodness. But still offers another great choice of fast casual to the 4th street dining scene."}
{"text":"This is a new build it yourself pizza joint at Robinson close to Giant Eagle.  It's a large modern space with seating inside. One price let's you pile on as many toppings as you want. There's lots to choose from and the ingredients seem to be good quality.  This was good pizza and worth the price. Definitely want to stop back and try other pizzas."}
{"text":"BEST BEST thin crust pizza, all organic, unlimited toppings $8.25. Gluten free also. LOVE , LOVE this place! April is the best and I'll be following her to the downtown location next week!"}
{"text":"Did not like the pizza as it wasn't cooked enough. Interesting that you select toppings for your pizza as if its a subway."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Fast  Great food Very well priced Best thin pizza I've had"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time I went here to grab a bite and it never disappoints! Both times I went was before the dinner rush hour so the lines just flow really smoothly. But I have seen how insanely long their lines have gotten before and I'm really not surprised. For the price of how affordable it is, you can't beat it. I always choose to build my own pizza and you can pick up to 5 toppings (I always get extra chicken too), and a drink.. total comes out to be $11. Not a bad deal, right? Overall, I really like this place - the staffs are great and the ingredients are always fresh. I would come back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Was so impressed from the moment we walked it!  The staff was fun, helpful and eager to help us in our selections especially because we had never been. I order the red vine, while my guy got the meat eaters.  Pizza is fired off in a gas controlled \"pizza oven\". Much tastier than a regular pizza experience.  The crust was so thin, and crispy, it made me homesick for the pizza I had back in Wisconsin. If they cut it into squares, it would have sealed that deal, lol!  DEFINITELY going back!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we've been to Blaze & as always it didn't disappoint.  I wanted to give a special shoutout to Bing! We walked in late not knowing when they closed & he still gave us the best service."}
{"text":"Great pizza, affordable and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really easy cool place. It's like a subway for pizza. The pizza cools really fast and you can watch it in the oven. Delicious! Decent value as well."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome. Dewayne who made my pizza was AWESOME, super friendly and made me laugh quite a few times.   Only thing I noticed is one of the other employees who was female (I think her name was Marlena) was very rude to him right in front of me, which I didn't understand because he was amazing."}
{"text":"Gelreat service, super friendly, kind and good suggestions from those who work \"on the line\".  Pizza was perfect, place is clean, and just enough people eating to keep it lively at 8 pm on a Wed"}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time recently and it was quick and my custom pizza turned out delish! The staff were mostly teenagers and were helpful, friendly, and professional. 4/5 because behind the counter I could see the counters and floor were messy and that is a little off-putting."}
{"text":"You have to try this pizza joint! Blaze Pizza offers a wide variety of pizza combinations, a few desserts, and even their original beverages! This thin crust pizza is made to your liking and can be mixed and matched however you like!  Blaze Pizza also is environmentally friendly, and very charitable. They hold numerous fundraisers which proceed to local organizations and causes.   You owe it to yourself to check out Blaze."}
{"text":"Blaze is a \"once a week\" place for us. With really good prices, and amazing tasting pizza, we are never disappointed.  My daughter has celiacs, so I love that they offer Gluten Free dough, and a glove change for the all the staff. They also offer gluten free pizza sauce.  The pizza prices are really decent tbh for the quality. Add $2 for the gluten free.  I've ordered in store and online with very little issues, and if they did have issues they fixed it really quickly.  Love the natural soda choices here as well.  The line can get long, but they are really quick and keep the line moving."}
{"text":"This type of pizza place are the current rage. After being to a few of them, I must say that they are pretty much the same concept, with a product that is.....pretty much the same. Blaze did, however, have a great staff and seemed like a few more options to put on your favorite pizza. I thought the pizza was very good, should have asked for another minute or so in the oven as it was a bit limp, but it did have a lot of stuff on it. Gluten free is not my cup of tea, but for many it is the determining factor when they choose a place to eat. For me, the closest one of these shops is who will get my business and Blaze is for the time being, the closest. I have nothing negative to say only positive with regard to customer service, product and cost. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great and tasty food. Employees are pretty cool. Always get the build your own, top it off!! The owner lady is awesome too. Glad I live close by, I come here pretty often."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to start by saying that Blaze Pizza has one of the best customer service I have encountered in a long time. The service here is awesome! With that said, the pizza is equally satisfying with many options to choose from. Thank you Blaze pizza you are my #1 choice for best value, service and great tasting pizza!"}
{"text":"Hardly any sauce or cheese... tastes like pizza crust with a few pieces of chicken thrown on top. Staff was nice enough but this pizza is a total bummer."}
{"text":"Update: We went in to place our order since we have been having issues with our online orders being made properly. We spoke with Shy the Manage about picking our pizzas and they were missing ingredients or had ones we asked be not included. She was very understanding and offered us a Free pizza and then coupons for another visit to make it right! I was Very Impressed!! Sometimes all you get is a Sorry we will do better speech but Shy wanted to be sure that we returned! We ate there last night and our pizzas were Perfect!! It's a great place with fresh ingredients and delicious pizza!! Thank you Blaze!!    We used Love Blaze!! It's so convenient to order online and just run it and grab it when working from home or on days off!! Like make a custom pizza with All My Favorites!! Sometimes delicious/sometimes under cooked and missing ingredients that are listed on the box cover. Sometimes Great pizza, but if you're ordering a Pick Up Order- CHECK IT FIRST!!! Staff like pizza can be either friendly or going through the motions without care on quality and accurate pick up orderand the prices are reasonable as well!! Thanks Blaze!"}
{"text":"What a unique way to serve fast food pizza! I would choice this over any of the fast food chains in the area hands down!  A Healthier build your own pizza! GOT A LOVE IT!  The price, value and quality can't be beat. Friendly, clean shop. Eat in or dine outside on the patio during good spring, summer or fall weather.  The ingredients are fresh and in plain sight for you to see, just what your ordering. The choices are all to suit any pizza lover. I love the lemonade drink choices, blood orange was my choice. The Agua Fresca choices are delicious as well. They change the choices fragrantly.  There is something for everyone.  The service is quickly and friendly and helpful to first time customers. Take out boxes are available if you find it hard to finish the whole pizza. I Highly Recommend and a Must Try to all Pizza Lovers. I will keep this on the restaurant rotation list !  My choice for fast food.  I can't comment on the desserts, but I will try the next visit."}
{"text":"What took me so long   I went to Blaze Fast Fire'd Pie for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  Blaze has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.  Blaze, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.  I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  Blaze offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables and the  prices are modest.  The staff is friendly, accomadating,  the food is good, and at a reasonable price.   If your in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza I've ever had. They cook it for such a quick time (that's their gimmick) that it doesn't taste done. The only positive I can say is they have a GF dough option."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. They offer a wide variety of toppings and vegan/ gluten-free options. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are pizza novices as we have both worked in the pizza industry for a while and we are EXTREMELY impressed with this place!!! It's out favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Wonderful, helpful staff. Chris took our order and walked us through and he was so polite and energetic. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing for a quick lunch! The staff was friendly and handled a rush really well. Manager was nice- and the restaurant/ restrooms were clean!"}
{"text":"Yep, they get 5 stars, it was a great experience. Clean, friendly knowledgeable about Gluten free.  I loved the fact that they made my gf pizza with fresh pizza dough. I watched them make it.  I took nothing home, I ate the whole thing, it was that good! My BF had to the ART LOVER, he really liked it. We will be back and we recommend Blaze"}
{"text":"My FIRST time here on Pi Day of all days!! I also bought the LAST pie today;)  I got the regular crust with the pesto garlic base and then vegged out the top, added turkey meat balls and chicken and topped it all off with obscene amounts of garlic, fresh and roasted.  The finished product is shown below.  Just to make myself feel like I was being healthy I got a side of the very tasty quinoa and kale salad.  I must say even though the concept is the same as Mod they did offer some of their own unique twists on the topping choices. There will be a closer location opening up closer to home soon....looking forward to that!  Even though I inadvertently snuck in just before closing everyone I talked to was still very courteous...Big ups for excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch or dinner. Cheap pizza, friendly staff, and quick service. The food was so so so good. They have so many options for toppings and sauces. This place has a lot of little things that count, like to-go boxes for you to grab, cheese and pepper flake shakers, and many drink options. The worker bussing tables asked us twice if we need napkins or refills which was super cool of him. Definitely recommend and definitely will be coming back to try different toppings!"}
{"text":"Thin crust is perfect! The pesto garlic sauce was a nice change from regular red sauce. Got the White Top pizza (bacon, oregano, arugula) while my brother and his wife made their own. A good choice of fresh ingredients. All around everyone loved it. Service at this location was exceptional!  Would come again."}
{"text":"We huffed our away over to Blaze. I had this pesto chicken individual pizza that kicked butt. If you like pesto, just ask for extra! The pizzas are 12\" in nature and the crust is excellent. As the Wetzels said \"We are the new Chipotle of pizza.\" The place is clean and the ingredients tasted fresh. The service was very good and the staff are well orientated. The outdoor patio is nice in the summer evenings. Located off 12th street and bell is conducive to many other businesses to partake in. Try out the next big thing...  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"This is an amazing pizza place. Let me start by saying that I have lots of allergies to more than 25 different foods. Many of the foods they carry there would cause severe allergic reactions to me. When I walked in and explained my dietary restrictions, they smiled, said \"Sure!\" and separated every last part just so I could eat there. The staff was well versed in the allergens in their dough and worked with me without getting frustrated. The pizza was much better than any fast service pizza place anywhere nearby and the ingredients were top quality. They listened very well and accurately made my pizza with special finishes, clean knives, and glove changes."}
{"text":"Great, fast pizza. Tasty choices to customize your pizza like you'd customize your burrito at Chipotle. Friendly staff and the place was very clean. I will return."}
{"text":"This is my first time at blaze pizza and the staff, Ashleigh and the counter girl, I think her name is elaine we're supper nice and helpful ! Ashleigh made an amazing pizza that looked beautiful and tasted so good ! Will defiantly come back because of the amazing service I received !"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I had the Vine, added art hearts, mushrooms, goat cheese, garlic and oregano. Topped with arugala.  Really good crust, nice and thin, chewy and crispy. Very pleasantly surprised. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Price was right too. Got as take out and it stayed crispy and hot until we ate at home."}
{"text":"Great spot for organic pizza with great employees. Their always helpful and ask how it is after you receive your food. I highly recommend \" Build your own pizza\" great price for the value. I would like to suggest frosted mugs though for their beer, gets warm fast."}
{"text":"First time here!   Super easy, super fresh!  Make your own pizza all the toppings you want for $7.99!!   Awesome.  I had their red sauce, mozz cheese and fresh mozz cheese.   Onions, mushrooms, spinach and grilled onion.    All super fresh.   My husband had ham, salami, pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and peppers.    They say 180 seconds...but if you pile on the toppings it takes a few extra minutes. Well worth the wait!   Crisp thin crust, tangy fresh tomato sauce and deliciousness toppings!   While half of my pizza came home....my husband finished his.   We will visit often! The little communication with the staff was all positive!  Helpful and courteous!!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's overrated. The concept of the restaurant is cool- you get to customize your own pizza and watch it be baked in the fast-fire oven. It's nice that they have a gluten free crust and vegan cheese, but the GF crust was lacking. It was very thin and too crispy- I like my pizza crust thick and chewy. The toppings were disappointing, too. They put like 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the entire pizza, a tiny amount of cheese, two leaves of spinach, and a small amount of peppers. The pizza had minimal flavor and was not what I was expecting. I'm sad to say that I didn't enjoy Blaze as much as I wanted to."}
{"text":"Online ordering was a breeze and pick up time was great; however, our pizzas were overcooked (black edges and bottom) and almost completely DRY  might try them again but will need to go in and order in person to watch them make the pizza. Might need to order them with extra sauce next time."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of Blaze, but I left feeling pretty satisfied. Like other's have mentioned you can either build your own or order from the pre-made pizza selection. They have a large variety of toppings to pick from and that is something I was happy to see. I decided to build my own! For my dough selection, I went with the high rise (which is somehow less calories than the original thin crust). For the sauce, the white cream was a no brainer, as I was going for a mediterranean style pizza. The remaining toppings I added are as follows:  fresh mozzarella, grilled chicken, artichoke, basil, red pepper, kalamata olives and a balsamic glaze. You can add as many toppings as you want and it will cost you $7.95 regardless. The pizza's are also the perfect 6 cut size. This is a great spot to grab lunch if you are in the area! If you see a line, do not let that turn you away. They will have the pizza's out within 180 seconds so you can get your grub on. They also have an online ordering option if you really want to get in and out fast. Also, make sure to check in on yelp to get the buy 1 get 1 free pizza offer!"}
{"text":"Great quality pizza for $9!! Sold! It takes three minutes to cook and about two to assemble. Great for groups, families, or to go. The main thing I loved was the staff. Super fast and friendly. Explained the process and Raven suggested I put the garlic pesto on the crust and it was awesome. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 2 thinking it might be a better time, still a line,oh well. Fast courteous service and the pizza was great. Thought that I'd take the wife after she got out of work but to no avail,pizza was all gone. The gentleman at the door gave us coupons for two free pizzas.a better deal all around. I COMMEND THE STAFF THAT WORKED THAT LINE SO ALL OF US ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTER COULD ENJOY THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR. GOOD JOB!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and I'm jealous I didn't come up with this concept!  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is very open and inviting. It was well staffed and everyone was attentive and helpful, spending extra time with us to go over how the menu works. I created my own pizza with pesto sauce and veggies. You walk down the line and say which toppings you want (they also have specialty pizzas on the menu you can choose from if you don't want to create your own). Once you pick everything, they put it in the oven, you pay, and sit down. Then they call you once it's ready.   The quality of the pizza was good. The manager even came over to see how are food was, and again to clear the table once we were done. My only complaint is I wish the pizza was a bit warmer. It got cold pretty quickly. But it was still delicious nonetheless! And the price was great - about $10 for the entire pizza and a fountain drink. I will definitely return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! I was hoping it would be as good as the similar place we tried in Vegas and it was great. The pizzas looked like they might be a tad overdone for my taste when they were coming out of the oven, but both of ours were delicious! Everyone was friendly, the pizzas were done quickly, though they were busy, and all the ingredients are fresh. I highly recommend it. :-)"}
{"text":"Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I don't go head hunting to bad mouth establishments. I appreciate small business and know that these places do their best to make it in a competitive market. Having said that, I have to keep my reviews honest. This pizza was just bad, and I MADE IT. It seems as though most reviews are new to the \"make your own pie\" experience so they have nothing to compare it to in which case I hope they stay loyal to Blaze but their are much better options in close proximity.   This is just like any of the \"make your own pie\" place and nothing really separates Blaze Pizza from the other pizza joints and I've been to all of them...MOD, Fired Pie, Pieology, the Studio, etc. The only gimmick I could see is that they do offer a one topping price and after that, its a pretty bland place both in pizza and in experience.   Being my first time in I made my pizza half and half so I could try two different pies. On one half I did red sauce and the other their pesto. Neither had any real taste to it and felt like I could have made it at home out of a jar. The crust was a fine and had a bit more thickness to it than most thin crust options at other places (they did have a double thick crust for more money as an option too). Lastly their topping selection was the least amount to choose from than any other place out there like it. All the staples were there but places like MOD and Pieology had more sauces and toppings along with much better salad options.   Both of my kids had pizzas as well and felt the same as I did, even asking if they had to finish it. My wise cracking son made the joke that he would be worried that if he ate the cardboard take out box, would he even notice a difference. Ouch!  The cleanliness and seating is why I gave it two stars instead of one and the employees working were nice and friendly but seriously go a bit further down I-10 to MOD pizza on Litchfield for the best build your own pizza experience because this just doesn't cut it at all!"}
{"text":"There are SO many pizza places out there now  , a place really needs to be fabulous or different.  This place is both! Normally hate franchise but this one becomes an exception to the rule.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Was so impressed with the staff, the pizza, the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the location and the price I paid. I got the green stripe pizza, and my friend got a make your own.    The lady who helped us on our first time was Kaitlyn. She easily explained the whole menu, and answered the questions we had. Some of the best customer service I had received in a long time.     The atmosphere is perfect for a first date, or a lunch out with friends. The pizzas were only 8.25 a piece, which I thought was totally reasonable.   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We came into Blaze on opening new night. Free pizza was being given with any like or follow on social media so it was packed which was to be expected. However even with the line leading outside, from getting in line to getting back in the car, pizza in hand, it only took thirty minutes.  I was not only impressed by how quickly everyone was moving but also the level of teamwork and customer service that we were given. Genuine smiles and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and interacting with customers despite the crowds of people.   Late review: saved as a draft but never got around to posting (typical me). I have been back twice since this initial review and it has been just as great!"}
{"text":"\"Okay another pizza joint\" I thought. What's special about this one? Well I was pleasantly surprised at everything in this place. Customer service was fantastic. Even asked if I wanted them to change their gloves from making a previous order. That was something I haven't been asked before. And the food was so delicious!! I love that they can make a vegan option for you! (I'm not even vegan btw) and the atmosphere is really chill and welcoming. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"The dough was really tough and chewy. I even for the high rise dough and it was still flat like thin crust. The white pizza I got was flavorless. The spicy red sauce was actually delicious but overall the pizzas were terrible. The service was good and timely"}
{"text":"Like MOD, this build-your-own pie spot is pretty delish. So many options, and we tried many of them. They offered a BOGO deal their first month open, which we found pretty neat. Hopefully they do more of those. Either way, cool little spot. We'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great pizza place! It is a beautiful building with lots of natural light and really high ceilings. The staff was some of the friendliest that I've experienced. It is a make your own pizza place. They have signatures as well, but I really enjoyed the selection and price for the building your own - under $12. The whole time they were making my pizza they were having a genuine and interesting conversation with me. After the pizza was made and we were eating in the corner by the beautiful ceiling high windows, the staff came over to check if everything was going well, even though it is generally a self serve set up. No tip option was given at the cash, which was a classy way of saying this is just how we do business. Well, I can tell you, I'll be sure to share my excellent experience with the service and quality of food. It is well worth a visit. I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit Blaze Pizza the first day they opened.  Have to say they off to a good start!  Staff appeared well trained and organized?  Pizza and kale/quinoa salad tasted great!  I look forward to many more visits and taking advantage of their rewards program.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it here. I like the concept of unlimited toppings the drinks are very good, too! They have like a mint mojito,lemonade/tea mix. Some raspberry lemonade! I'll be backI just wish they had plates it was a little messy with the box"}
{"text":"Love Blaze! I first had it in Arkansas and was thrilled when they put one in Monroeville.  This location consistently puts out awesome pizza. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! The service is impeccable.  Nice, realaxed vibe, delicious simple desserts, staff is super friendly and catering. Clean n neat place. This is a nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place! So can try any topping combinations if you do a make your own pizza! Their toppings are plenty and delicious. So easy to place the order and the pizza is ready in few minutes. Also try their arugula goat cheese salad, soo yummy!"}
{"text":"We ate there twice.  Each time, the pizza was hot and perfectly cooked.  The ingredients were fresh and flavorful.  Additionally, the line people were friendly and helped us choose exactly what we wanted.  The manager came over to find out personally how the food tasted.  In short, we felt welcomed there.  Though it is rather far from where we live, we will definitely return for more pizzas!"}
{"text":"We did not have to wait too long in the line of customers. I ordered my pizza, and an employee assembled it. I thought it was odd that the employee put the toppings on the pizza and then asked me if I wanted sauce underneath on the crust. The pizza and a soda were a reasonable price, and they tasted good. Plenty of seating was available."}
{"text":"Fast!  Exceptional topping choices!  Friendly staff.  I love that you can customize a pizza with so many different options.  Arugula, yum!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza..love u get whole pizza as well, lots of food fresh ingredients..what can be better.  Only if it was free...I will go again...very good pizza...loved the veggies pizza....thank u again"}
{"text":"Good food and desserts for sure.   The line can sometimes take 10-20 minutes.   But overall great. The brownies are awesome and a great environment."}
{"text":"I typically can't Pizza, I know very sad! I still love the concept cheese and delicious fresh ingredients. This is a very build a pizza kind of place and very awesome to those like me.   As soon as we entered I noticed how clean and very \"warehouse modern\" it looked. What made me happy was that I was able to explain please just a sprinkle of cheese. Im happy that they were able to accommodate a can't eat cheese type of person like me. If I am ever in this area I will definitely stop by this place as it is both kid friendly and a great spot to eat."}
{"text":"So call to order and they will not take order, so order on line, then message says they will not cook it until you arrive , I know why now!!! They do not have confidence in the employees to read the online order, it was incorrect. Painfull pizza experience spend the extra money and go to a real pizza shop"}
{"text":"For a chain that is quite out of the way, we find ourselves coming back here quite often. I can safely say we've totally taken into the build-your-own pizza thing with unlimited toppings. It's still a total bargain at $8, but more importantly it's delicious. Our creations are nowhere close to a traditional pizza. To be clear, I appreciate white or margherita pizzas as much as the next person, but more often than not I crave something more substantial. It turns out that putting all my favorite vegetables and meats in a live-fire oven on top of a piece of dough can make for a very enjoyable meal. And there's definitely room to be creative with different combinations of sauces, cheeses, and spices as well.  Another neat feature is their offering of drinks. They have, in addition to fountain sodas, two types of agua fresca and two types of lemonade. They are all refreshing and worth trying, but we especially liked the agua frescas. One is a cactus pear; the other is key lime mint. Both taste very real without being overly sweet. They are great alternatives to the usual sodas for pairing with your meal."}
{"text":"This has been like my 5th time visiting this location and my first time experiencing the cuisine! I am so impressed with the build your own pizza's concept! I love the fact that you can basically put anything you want on your pizza topping for a thin crust person pan pizza! My usual is the \"white top\". If I could I would come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Stopped in last night for the first time. We were greeted immediately, had incredible friendly service, and the pizza was DELICIOUS. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Personal pizzas served fast.  Tons of fresh ingredients to top your own custom pizza. Think chipotle but with a pizza crust.  Pizzas at $7.95 and big enough for two.  This place is a chain so it's casual and good for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great pizza, vegan cheese, fresh toppings , fast, clean, friendly staff, and great value."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Any toppings you want and how ever much you want for one price! It always surprises me because the quality of the food is impressive for how much you can get. What's better than creating your own pizza? Eating your own pizza! It's a decent size pizza and I always have leftovers to take home which gives me multiple meals for the price of one. The lemonades are very good too! I recommend the original."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite place for our family.  We stopped here after church because it is new.  The size of the pizzas are small enough for an adult to eat... unless you grey a ton of toppings.  For $8.95, you can build your own pizza.  They have a ton of toppings and you can have as many toppings as you like.  My kids loved it too! We will make this a regular on our lunch stops."}
{"text":"I love just about anything that I can customize. Blaze Pizza is no different.   Much like other make-it-your-way restaurants, you choose your crust, sauce, and toppings that include a variety veggies, meats, and cheeses.   The pizza is then fired and finished with newly added finishes like pesto, balsamic vinegar, and more.  Lastly, the drinks are very unique and not your normal soda options. I like the frescas.   This is a must visit. Make sure you grab a box because you'll be so full, you might not finish."}
{"text":"It is the Chipolte of pizza, but their staff and manager are the lowest. I tried this place out for my first time today. It is good, but nothing I will come back for. I was waiting for my pizza and the manager or whomever was in charge, was leaving and dropping \"F\" bombs back and fourth with his staff. It was extremely unprofessional and so is an $8.00 , 11\" pizza margarita!!"}
{"text":"Went to Blaze for lunch on a Saturday. It was our first visit and my fiancé and I were impressed. The staff was friendly. Service was quick. We both chose to pick one of their signature pizzas instead of making our own.  I had the Green Stripe and he has the BBQ chicken. Both were flavorful and delicious. We would definitely go back and try different options or order the same!"}
{"text":"I love it here!! My favorite is the Art Lover pizza ... but instead of the red sauce dollops I get the garlic pesto sauce!! It's amazing"}
{"text":"Our family loves Blaze. Our toddler calls it the \"pizza store\" and loves going and watching them make the pizzas. We love the ability to customize, so much more than you can at other pizza places. I load mine up with veggies and love the variety of toppings they offer."}
{"text":"I ate at a Blaze Pizza out in Vegas and wasn't very impressed.   After seeing this location open close to home I figured we'd give it a try.  I equate this to a subway for pizza.  You walk down the assembly line as you tell the folks what you want on your pizza.  They throw it in the oven and call your name when it's done.  All said and done this was a much better experience than my last visit to the Vegas location.  I'll be back again one day."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Love the customizable pizzas, friendly atmosphere, and reasonably priced. Will be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"So delicious, the concept is fabulous. Makeing your own pie sort of like a subway for pizza or you can pick one of the signature pies. I got the link and embellished to make my own creation. They seem to have fresh toppings with some you would want but not expect like roasted garlic, chopped garlic, sea salt, chopped zucchini and so many others with many kinds of vegetables and meats. Staff is friendly and up beat. All around this place is fantastic for a quick bite that doesn't break the bank and is actually very tasty. . After all you designed it. The reason  it wasn't 5 stars is because it was burnt.  Definitely will be back, I hope they maintain the same quality and staff friendliness. I believe the temperature is set too high since staff was watching  the oven the whole time. Or perhaps just getting a real fire oven instead of a pretend one."}
{"text":"Best fresh pizza joint I've been too! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Very affordable and excellent quality and service."}
{"text":"Second time trying Blaze but first time trying this location.   Huge restaurant. Lots of seats.   Order pizza and get to see how much toppings can be applied.   Self serve pop and pricing is decent from $8-15.   Thin crust pizza is my choice.   iOS app available and staff is super friendly.   Overall pizza  is excellent and highly recommend for Mission area."}
{"text":"I love that they take such good care of the gluten free pizza. Don't forget to use the coupon at the top of the Yelp page."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and surprisingly loved it. All the ingredients that were used for my pizza were really fresh and you could really taste it. The girl who made the pizza was also very friendly and welcoming! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for a quick pizza! My first time at this location and it was a pleasant experience. I go often to the other Calgary location at Sunridge, now I don't have to, as I live and work close by 4th street S.W.  So if you haven't tried it, you must, as you line up the staff ask for your name and then you get to choose your toppings starting from your sauces to your meats and then veggies. It's awesome, and very affordable. A thin crust with unlimited \"build your own\" is under $12 and what a great selection of toppings ranging from spinach, fresh basil, roasted garlic, different peppers, artichoke are amongst just a few. After selecting your pizza enters the oven which take 180 seconds to completely bake your pizza. So you can really be in and out under less than 10 minutes total, I hope you all try it and leave your experiences on yelp, I enjoy this place very much. Also after your pizza is ready, don't forget you can add a few final toppings upon completion, I always add arugula and sometimes dress it up with olive oil. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I've noticed a decline in customer service. Wednesday our order was messed up and the pies were poorly made overall. I called and spoke with Troy, manager, about the mistake. He was very nice and offered to place our order another day. I told him I didn't have the receipt so he said he was gonna look it up and write my name down and I wouldn't have anything to worry about when I go in. Well today I went in and when I mentioned the conversation I had with Troy the workers were looking at me like I was crazy and just overall very rude. It made me feel embarrassed in front of other customers when it was their mistake in the first place. Everyone seemed like they were in a bad mood and the pizza making area was a hot mess. The girl who made our pizzas was sloppy and inconsistent. On top of it all- when I got home we realized one of the pies wasn't a high rise! And when the guy was boxing up our pizza as he forgot again to put the arugula and drizzle and I had to remind him. It would've been messed up all over again if I wasn't standing there watching him. It's sucks because my husband loves this place and always me to pick it up to take to his work for lunch dates. It's all about how issues are handled!  Pros- food is good, although some workers need more guidance when building a pie- like can you try to get the whole pie, not just one spot?! Etc"}
{"text":"OMG the best pace ever its Disneyland in my mouth can't wait for them to come to Atlanta"}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a month. They know how to do fast fired pizza A LOT better than Pieology across the street. Also, if you get the app, like them on FB, or sign up for their loyalty program, you get BOGO coupons quite often. Always friendly, always helpful, always delicious."}
{"text":"Second visit was as disappointing as the first. Used the App to \"pre-order.\" Waited for over 20 minutes, after I arrived and checked in. Watched as people who came in and placed orders after I did, left with their pizzas. When I finally got home to eat, one crust was burned and barely edible.  The other not done enough. Last time for me. App is removed!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so yummy here. Just don't order online cuz you'll wait longer to get your pizza then actually ordering it in person. The red sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Pizza crust is very good- we like thin crust and it was perfect. The build your own section is amazing- they aren't shy with the ingredients and you can literally put ANYTHING you want on it to customize your pizza. Service is very friendly and professional. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great fast causal pizza place. I LOVE that they have vegan cheese for no extra cost. Tons of veggies as well and buffalo sauce  I've been to blazes all over the country and this one seems to be a bit chaotic. Always very busy and crowded and the staff wasn't as nice or patience as I would hope. They also cross contaminant all of the food with the sloppy grabs of the toppings. Still giving 5 stars cause I love the vegan pizza."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is about to be extremely long but it's worth reading...  so to start off..If you're trying to start off here for a first job or a JOB PERIOD I  suggest TO NOT work here! The place is extremely slow and they ask you to leave and cut your hours extremely short, specially for beginners if you have no work experience like myself. But don't get me wrong the people I met were very friendly and I met extremely down to earth people but unfortunately how I was treated and got fired was wrong and it made me look at the company and the management ALOT differently then what I had envisioned of this place before. It made me not ever want to step foot in that place again. I know it's a little childish, but I was just so upset I had to make my mom pick up my last check I received from them because knowing my temperament I would have had to curse a few people out and probably would have went to jail so I thank my mom for going up there picking up my check I honestly don't know what I'll do without her.  I was just so disgusted and upset specially by this being my first job ever. I am only 17 and teenagers can sometimes make mistakes and there should have been a second chance resolved here in this situation, but I guess you just live and you learn.I promise you and I put this on everything that I love that I did not deserve to be fired for something I know I didn't do and something that is way out of my character. My mother raised me right and I have a good head on my shoulders, soon to be a ASU student with a 3.5+GPA, and my mom knows,  and GOD knows that I wouldn't dare steal anything, like cmon now you think I'll steal at my first job ever?? Anyone that knows me personally know I wouldn't do something like this. They supposedly excused me of stealing money out of a cash register. I guess my cashier register was short of change  but I KNOW for a fact I gave people the correct amount of change back and if I maybe made a mistake and gave people a little over it's no way in HELL should it be around a 150 dollars short, (this is the amount they said that was short under my name). I'm sure someone set me up that works there and I'm sure has done this multiple times before and used my last four digits to get into my account to log into my cash register and took the money out for theirselves and try to put it on me. So i just know they fired the wrong person and I hope who ever did this to me gets what they deserve. They couldn't even find this so called missing money or prove that I \"supposedly\" took this money the way they were making it seem. The whole situation was ridiculous and bullshit but I know everything happens for a reason and if I could give this place 0 stars I would. They made something I thought would be a wonderful experience an absolute AWFUL ONE specially with this being my first ever job was very disappointing. I really hate that I live down the street from this place and have to pass by it everyday. Wish it would just get shut down and I don't have to bother seeing it.  DONT BUY THEIR NASTY ASS PIZZA, trust me it really is not that great you can go get something better at fired pie or even a dominoes or Pizza Hut beats this place. And man I wish I had a huge platform to rant to this about it was just so unfair specially the fact they couldn't even prove or find out what actually happened to the money I mean they have cameras around that place everywhere so if I so called stole the money they should have seen it on camera.. but maybe someday I will have a platform to rant to this about. I just wish I wouldn't never applied here and I don't encourage who ever is reading this either or to even buy their pizza for that matter. Helpful?"}
{"text":"Cool idea. But, feel short on taste. This side of Pittsburgh has MUCH different tastes in flavor than I do so maybe it's a local hit. I didn't feel it had much flavor, VERY BLAND! I got the spicy sauce and jalapeños and garlic and barely tasted any of it. If you're from the south or east coast, I'd pass. But, if you're from the western side of Pittsburgh, you might really like it."}
{"text":"If you like fresh pizza this is a fast and perfect place to go. Only giving 4 stars since staff seemed very dead and not too happy. Other than that pizza was great and many options were available."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight due to a special they were having. I've eaten a lot of pizza from a lot of different places in my lifetime, but I can honestly say that this one was THE Best pizza I have ever eaten! OMG, it was so good! I left miserable because I should have stopped eating, but it was good, I kept on.  Blaze is like the Subway of pizza. All the toppings are before you and you tell the people which ones you want and watch as they make your pizza. Not enough cheese for you? No problem, just tell them to add more! And there's a ton of different cheeses to choose from, too....not just mozzarella.  Then the toppings. I've never seen so many (and I worked in a pizza place when I was younger!). And it's not like traditional pizza places where you pay by the topping. A one-topping is cheaper, but if you're getting two or twenty, it's all the same price.  Then when you get to the end of the line, you pay and patiently wait for your pizza. But you don't wait long because their fire ovens cook the pizzas in about 3 minutes. Yes, only three minutes and they're cooked, not icky and doughy.   The pizzas are a medium size and cost $8.25 (before tax). You can get a box for it if you want it to go or just can't eat all of it. We couldn't, so took the rest home. When my son came home from work, he heated the leftover pizza up in the microwave and even with being reheated (which, to me, is gross) he said it was the best pizza he'd had, too.  Can't recommend this place enough! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My grandkids took me to a Blaze Pizza for the first time in another area. I was very happy to find out that there was a location closer to me. I came in to this location to try it out. I was very  happy to see that it was even better than I expected. The employees at this location are amazing. They are so very pleasant and accommodating. I have many different family members, and they can each design the pizza of their choice. The employees are great about doing the pizzas half and half, which works even better for me with my little grand munchkins.   Everyone that I have brought here has truly enjoyed this restaurant as much as I enjoyed sharing it with them. Eating my favorite pizza, not getting charged separately for all of my toppings, and washing it down with a beer, great customer service, and I am a happy customer. Thanks Blaze Pizza"}
{"text":"The was pizza is slammming.....reminds me of New York thin slice......sooooo freaking delish....."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this business makes their money - because the pizzas are too reasonable and delicious.  Now that I got that out of the way, It has a chipotle-like feel to me, from the menu to the selection options to the industrial style seating. For $7.95 you can make your own pizza with as many toppings as you want.    If you're the type of person that doesn't want to look at all the toppings and pick what you want, they have specialty pizzas (FOR THE SAME PRICE) already made up for you. They have different sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies. At first I thought it was a joke, but if you can build it they can make it!  The first time I completely overdid it with the toppings. I want ALL the meats, no veggies, sprinkle that salt and oregano on there and give me a couple of drizzles on that bad boy.  I may have only eaten like 2 slices before I was completely full!  They also have another \"upgrade\" option of getting a thicker crust for $2 more, which I am an absolute fan of!  Thin crust is cool, but the thicker one just tasted heartier to me. Ok, now let's talk size.  My husband and I can share a thicker crust pizza with as many toppings as we want.  I'm serious. There is NO REASON to order 2 pizzas between the two of us (unless you don't like the same toppings and don't want to split one). The three times we have been here we both have NEVER eaten our entire pizzas - NEVER. Oh, and I never thought I'd be a fan of sprinkling a small amount of salt over your pizza before it cooks, but it makes it taste like heaven in dough form!  Drinks - they have a typical soda machine, but they also have various lemonade flavors, which some are absolutely delightful, BUT some do taste like that artificial sweetener stuff, so taste at your own discretion.  I like to mix my lemonade with a bit of sprite to give it some extra zest. I wish they had 7up or ginger ale, but a tad of sprite gives it a nice zesty punch taste.  There isn't any alcohol served here, but it isn't that type of establishment. They want you in and out.  I've tried this place twice in two weeks, and me and my husband have a dinner date with friends on Friday to go again! Yes, I said dinner date, and YES it's going to be at Blaze! The atmosphere is just comfortable and the food is good, so why not?"}
{"text":"This place is super fast, yummy, clean and  vibrant. Excellent customer service. When we were there, the place was busy. My husband got the pizza with meatballs, pepperoni and ham.  I got the plain cheese pizza. We both enjoyed our choices. We will definitely be back. It was really cool to see how their ordering abs cooking system works."}
{"text":"What a disgusting location... To start off I've come here a few times since they opened. Last night ( 3/10 ) my friend and I went in 30 minutes before close. We were greeted by a negative staff that only cared about leaving. There were two other people in the restaurant already sitting down. The girl taking the order rushed us through and was rude. We ordered a cheese and a pepperoni and it literally took 20 + minutes. On top of that two young employees a young white girl and mixed young man ( looked about high school age ) were being loud, screwing around behind the counter, holding hands / swinging around, and completely unprofessional. After the pizzas were done, the guy with the beard let them sit out and get cold and waited till he was done with what he was doing to box them. Than when he finally was boxing them he dropped one of the boxes on the ground and just used the box anyways. I would've flipped out but we had a movie to catch. Save your money and go somewhere not disgusting"}
{"text":"Black in the Hat on ya screen, or in your screen. Went to this place a couple months back, because they sent out free pizza coupons. Think of it as the pizza version of subway, but with better toppings. Service is fast and I got just what I wanted on my pizza. Place was actually pretty dope! If your near I would say give it a try. I also had a goat cheese and beet salad.... not usually something I would eat...... but it was delicious!!!!  Blaze: One for the dude in the background, doing the running man with his pants down!  For real tho, give it a try! Subway Pizza Place or Palace!! Ohhhhhh"}
{"text":"I liked the build your own pizza. I could make all the choices-regular crust or raised crust, choose sauce, toppings and set the amount you want of it. That is what I liked the best. Very nice staff and a friendly environment made the experience satisfying and enjoyable. You can eat in or take out. Pizza is not boring here and I made the masterpiece. I really liked building my own pizza and being creative. They have a large variety of options to choose from. It costs a lot if I phone in an order like mine to a regular pizza place. Unique experience! I noticed I used healthier selections than when I order from regular pizza place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here once a week for date night, we happened to be running late on our plans but we still wanted Blaze so we went but this last experience is something I need to let everybody know. I understand you close at 10 but if arrive 10 minutes till closing your still open. I expect you to treat me as any valued customer during peak hours. Scott which I'm guessing is a supervisor did the exact opposite, he didn't acknowledge  us whatsoever didn't bother looking up or say a word unless it was our total, handed us our change  and left, then as he was taking out our pizzas he was banging everything, I understand body language and I understand you want to leave your miserable job but this unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Staff was very thoughtful and professional. Went on Monday and got a nice surprise, $5 dollar pizzas! Woohoo! Neat place where you can build your own pizza with the toppings of you choice."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Great price. Comfortable sitting. I tried the green stripe signature pizza and was not disappointed. Give this place a try. Nice and quick."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza made to order and \"blazed\" in a fast fired oven in a matter of minutes!  Yum yum better go get ya some!"}
{"text":"Fast pizza. Made to order. Not too pricey and good quality. It seems like they really care about the place and making sure customers enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Great lunch for a reasonable price!  Will definitely come back! One Pizza is enough for two people for a lunch, or one person with leftovers for an afternoon snack."}
{"text":"The subway of pizzas. I love that I can get chicken and tomatoes and extraaaaa ricotta on my pizza for a low price and even try a million different sauces. Mad I didn't find this place sooner. Kids approved as well. Chicken, tomatoes, & extra ricotta. Half red sauce half white. One slice balsamic (delicious) and one slice buffalo. I did find some bones or fat or something hard in some of the chicken. Wasn't happy about that. But everything else was very good. Other pizza was red sauce with bacon and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Here on opening day for their promo! The line moved fast and efficiently. I LOVE that turkey meatballs are an option. The pizza cooks fast enough that wait times are small.  The staff was great and helpful!   My only constructive criticism and personal preference would be to cut up the Canadian bacon. Having 4 giant slabs on my pizza is not the prettiest or easiest to eat as I would take a bite and the entire thing would slide off.   Overall a great addition to the little community! Will be back."}
{"text":"Best and most unique pizza experience I've ever had! Taste is amazing, atmosphere is cool, and price is affordable. Go-to date spot"}
{"text":"Everything was really good, but we got extra chicken on veggie pizza and  they forgot to add it. That's why 3 stars"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location I receive such great service. The manger is always very friendly! I made the mistake of going on Pi day ($3.14 pizza) the line was out the door and down to the sleep number store!! But even still I stayed in line and received an amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"I would go here everyday if I could. The pizzas are crispy, kinda like in New York. The toppings are delicious and everything is fresh. I will return again soon!"}
{"text":"When you want to make your own pizza, go here. Wonderful quantity of toppings and great taste. Forget those places that put one piece or two of pepperoni per slice. This is the place to enjoy pizza as a true meal."}
{"text":"SO good!  Service is really fast here.  Even if there's a line it moves quick.  Once you put your order in you'll wait less than 5 minutes for your pizza.  Tons of topping choices so even the pickiest of eaters can find something here. I highly recommend the pesto sauce, and the blood orange lemonade!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but service is pretty terrible. Maybe having your restaurant staffed entirely by high school age kids who are rude, slow, and don't seem to care at all about being there could be the culprit. Plenty of other places to get pizza where you don't have to deal with staff like this."}
{"text":"There are many of these build your own pizza places within a few mile radius and this is by far the best one!    Dough is good, sauce tastes so fresh and tomato-y and they have the best selection of toppings in my opinion.  Fresh mozzarella, ricotta cheese, tons of fresh veggies and other stuff I don't get.  They will really load up on the toppings too, other places put so little I'm always asking for extra.    Only thing missing is broccoli but maybe I'm the only weirdo who likes so many veggies on my pizza.    Love it!!"}
{"text":"The crew there is always fun and helpful! My wife has celiacs disease and they take all of the necessary precautions to make sure she doesn't get exposed.  I love the high rise dough and loading the toppings on!!!!! A+"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Portion sizes are appropriate, not huge. You can add whatever you want to your pizza. Really enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"While walking through the parking lot of Blaze, my girlfriend asked me what she should expect from this place - as she knew absolutely nothing about it. Despite being my first visit, I quickly rattled off my predictions.  It's just another fast casual pizza chain. They'll make you a pizza and they'll make it very quickly. The prices will be reasonable and the food will be acceptable. The décor will be sleek and modern - with dessert options that will probably consist of a cookie or brownie. There will be salad starters and a few \"upgrade\" options. Expect an assembly line ran by teenagers, with one adult present to supervise the group. Alcohol will be available to further distance the restaurant from being classified as \"fast food\" - the ultimate \"black mark\" label from the millennials.   And what do you know? My predictions were dead-on accurate - sans the alcohol, which I'm assuming is on hold due to a pending liquor license.  We already have tons of fast casual pizza chains in Phoenix. Fired Pie, Mod, and Char Pizzeria are the first ones that come to mind. So, what does Blaze do differently?  In short, nothing. Not-a-single-thing.   We ordered a couple of basic pepperoni pizzas, while sharing both a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie for dessert. The pizzas were fine, with the ultra-thin crust having slightly above average flavor. I'd say it's similar to Fired Pie, although not quite as crispy. It still falls within that realm of what I feel a high-end frozen pizza tastes like. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Just don't go in here expecting much flavor depth. It's standard pizza, it's cheap, and it's edible.   The question is: Would we return?  Maybe one day, as I'm semi-curious if their thicker dough option (at a two dollar upcharge) offers a boost in flavor. But in terms of all of the other \"fast casual\" pizza chains that Americans are currently obsessed with, Blaze just kind of blends in.  Now, if only someone could open one of those \"Make your own pie\" pizzerias that Kramer kept trying to launch on Seinfeld, maybe then I'll exhibit a bit more enthusiasm.  Nevertheless, give Blaze a try. It ain't too bad."}
{"text":"For me, Blaze was just okay; nothing super bad and nothing that elevates it to a four or five star place. There are several options of this type of pizza place; MOD, Fired Pie, Pieology, Studio and Blaze. Choosing one may very well come down to what you're closest to at the time, personal preference on fine details such as sauce, crust, topping appeal, soda/beer options, dessert, salads .... The first pizza tonight came out burnt and the staff swiftly re-fired another (which was great) but that one was also slightly burnt. Blaze does offer a tier pricing kind of menu from just cheese pizza, 1-topping, 2-topping, and unlimited which can have its benefits but the salads are pre-made/pre-dressed and they looked awful tonight I'm sorry. The lettuce was wilted very badly, the romaine on the Caesar was becoming translucent, and the presentation was buffet-like .. Bad day?? Maybe, but details like that are why I will stick with MOD or Fired Pie; they allow you to create your own from fresh ingredients vs pre-made scoop and plate. The pizza wasn't bad and the staff was cool, they greeted on the way in and said bye upon leaving but all the small details I mentioned above; personally feel are done better at the other places."}
{"text":"So..I saw the reviews from other locations and couldn't wait to try Blaze...but there was none in my area so I said okay....one day maybe.. well, I was reading the local news about pi day deals (3.14 pi and today's 3/14) and not only do I not have to traverse the valley to get an amazing pie but today's $3.14 all day long!  I have a lot of food allergies and tend to stay away from meatballs. Well, Blaze has you covered. ALL their ingredients are posted online!! I got turkey meatballs and man were they amazing! The spicy red sauce has just enough kick ...and the crust...woah that light airy yet sturdy bread! Best pie shell ever! Go on, load it up, it can handle the toppings!  Love it, can't wait to come back, and I'm not even done eating yet!"}
{"text":"Always make sure that the pepper container top is screwed on before you dump it on your entire pizza! This place was fun to try out but unfortunately because the tops were not screwed on to their condiment containers my pizza was not the best. My daughter loved drinking the root beer. I liked how we were able to customize items."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. They messed up my pizza but always worked to correct it. Very nice people working there and good clean atmosphere. Always on the mind when I want some food."}
{"text":"Super friendly and knowledgeable staff with seems to be hard to find these days at casual dining restaurants.  Kenny greeted us in with a nice friendly smile and had a nice positivity about him.  They are great about customizing and don't give you that \"look\" when you ask for \"a little more mushrooms please.\"  In addition their pizzas are the best tasting and most fresh that I've had from the build your own places. We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"There are like 4 fast food options near Miracle Mile. This place beats chipotle, Taco Bell, and chick fil a. It's $8 for a personal pizza customized on a subway-style toppings line. You can get pretty much anything on your pizza and they have some gluten free options."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I'm in lovvvvvve with this place!!!!! Everyone's always happy and nice. I used to go to pieology but blaze pizza beats it by far! Also their blood orange lemonade is amazing."}
{"text":"This place rules! Staff were helpful. Manager was walking the floor asking if people enjoyed their pizza. Pizza was great. It's set up like a chipotle but better, because it's pizza! Spicy red sauce rules. It's quick and inexpensive. Loved it."}
{"text":"So my roomie and I were super excited to try this place! My roomie had a build your own pizza.  I ordered bbq chicken. The toppings were plentiful and they both looked delicious. When we got home I took a piece of my pizza and it was burnt. It was so burnt I couldn't even eat one piece.  Couldn't taste any of the barbecue sauce or the toppings. Total bummer."}
{"text":"Wonderful service with a smile and delicious pizza ready quickly. We keep coming back for more. Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am so excited about blaze pizza! First you can make your pizza any way you want it with as many toppings as you want for the same price! They also have vegan cheese which is fantastic for my daughter is lactose and intolerant and cant ever have pizza without medicine. Most personal sized pizzas are between $$ 8-9. They also have pizzas that you can pick. Usually wait 10-15 minutes for  pizzas. Super fresh and yummy. You can also order online ahead of time and they will put your premade pizza in the oven right when you get there."}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to this location, but one thing special about today was that it was Pi Day, and they were running a special that all pizzas were $3.14.  I couldn't believe how crazy the crowds were (the lines wrapped all through the restaurant all the way to the back), but I shouldn't be surprised since the pizza price was such a deal.  This place is like the Subway/Chipotle of Pizza.  You basically choose how you want your pizza, pick a crust, sauce, cheese, and what toppings you want, and then it is fired in the oven in a pretty fast manner, and then you eat it.  On the two previous visits I was pleased with my pie, and today was no exception.  Gotta give some kudos to the crew, they kept the lines moving in a timely manner, and every person working the line was pleasant and courteous even though they were super swamped.  On a normal day you get a pizza with all the toppings you desire for $7.95, and today was even better since it was only $3.14.  Happy Pi Day!"}
{"text":"That was pretty lackluster and disappointing, I wish I had gone to fired pie like I originally planned.   A byop was $8.75 which is pretty standard and it was nice they had a thicker crust option (for $2 bucks). There wasn't anything special about their topping - except they were out of Gorgonzola and their spicy marinara had a weird tasting heat to it and was like fire (even tho the pizza dude said it wasn't very spicy).   The pizza way super thin once cooked, like it hadn't risen at all in the oven, not was it nice an crispy. Overall, I'd pass on eating here again. Especially after watching the girl making pizzas wipe her gloves on her pants several times while making people's pizza."}
{"text":"I want to here With a lot of apprehension. I was very surprised at how good the pizza was and how much I enjoyed it. One of my favorite pizza place, it's still pretty I'm good in a place I would go to again"}
{"text":"Considering this type of pizza establishment is a trend right now, I was unimpressed with Blaze. The pizza was fine, but could have used a bit more time in the oven. My salad was also just fine. It really lacked seasoning and I found it frustrating that I had to choose from one of their premise options. The best thing we ordered was the s'mores cookie. Ultimately, I'll head to MOD or Fired Pie the next time I'm looking for a quick pizza."}
{"text":"I really loved this place but the last two times I came here there was black specks all over my crust then I realized it's from the oven that they rarely clean. Kinda turned me off."}
{"text":"Don't use their app to order pizza because they will never receive it. It's the worst system I've ever seen, I have probably ordered of their app around 7 times and they have never ever got it on time, every time I get there they tell me they haven't received the order."}
{"text":"I've been to all the \"quick\" pizza joints and for some reason this one doesn't impress me... I feel  rushed through the line and I'm  gluten free, my  crust never seems cooked through"}
{"text":"Super friendly and accommodating staff. Looking for fast, fresh, custom pizza this is a must! Personal pizzas large enough to share slices to try everyone's, but not so large you can't finish your own. Definitely reccomend :)"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and I love that they have options for people that eat gluten free and have dairy allergies. I give it a a 2 when it comes to customer service though. Most of the time they just slap ingredients all in one spot just to get you out quicker. They never ask if you want to finishing items but will put them on if you ask."}
{"text":"Who knew our new pizza joint in Monroeville could fill such a void?  Tasty, fresh ingredients, cheap, lightning fast.  Whah??? All of those?  I'm tellin' you the truth.  It's in the old Long John Silver's location and building on US-22.  Convenient for me, a Monroeville-ite and yet, it's taken me this long to get here for a first-time visit.  On a budget?  7.95 gets you an 11 inch (6 slice) pizza with as many toppings as you want.  Really.  In a hurry?  180 seconds in a very hot oven gets you your pizza (once you've selected your toppings)  Want a tasty pizza?  The variety is outstanding.  Not just pizza toppings but sauces and cheeses, as well.  Suggestion that was a winner:  Spicy meat sauce with some pesto sauce drizzled on it, meatballs, mushrooms, onions, red peppers, fresh garlic cloves, fresh basil, mozzarella, oregano.  I have to say I thought this pizza was one of the best I've enjoyed.  Note that the crust is a thin crust; you don't have thick ones to choose from.  I thought it was better than Anthony's down the street, though I like theirs, just not as much.  Want friendly service?  We walked in not knowing what to do or expect. A kind employee asked if it was our first time and then suggested we build our own.  Another employee smiled and helped us select toppings. Another employee rang us up while smiling.  All good.  I will make a few notes:  Their menu online says they have beer and wine depending on availability.  I did not notice whether this location serves alcohol or not.  They say they have gluten-free options.  However, their website indicates cross-contamination may be possible so if you absolutely need to avoid gluten, this is not your place.  Their website also indicates this would be a good place to hold a fundraiser.  They help with the process and donate part of the proceeds.  This, I'd like to check out!   Bottom line for me:  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Usually they have good pizza but today the fucked up everything they gave one of our pizzas to someone else and forgot about us and then they let mine sit for five minutes trying to find out who it goes to ... shitty service"}
{"text":"I've visited Blaze a few times and haven't been disappointed.  I like being able to customize my pizza with the wide variety of toppings.  The wood fire oven cooks it perfection.  The timeframe from ordering to getting your pizza is quick, I haven't had to wait long on any of my visits. The cost is very affordable, I've always paid less than $10!"}
{"text":"When I want to get a bang for my buck I love checking in at Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza with my Yelp app and getting a bogo pizza!   I love the many choices they offer. Lately I've been getting the regular shell with garlic pesto sauce on the crust, classic red sauce and a mountain of toppings with a container of balsamic glaze on the side.  On occasion I've also enjoyed their agua Fresca drinks and a kale salad they used to have.   I have their App, you can earn \"flames\" for your pizza purchases to earn a free pizza."}
{"text":"Craving pizza before going to watch a movie in the shopping center so decided to try this place. They had a BOGO yelp offer at the time which made the visit all the more worth. The concept is neat, not original, but still fun. Choose your crust, your sauce and then toppings. Or just tell them to make one of their pre chosen pizzas and they'll make it fresh. Process was simple, toppings seemed fresh, lots of veggie options, and decent selection of meats. Price is great for the amount of pizza you're getting. Pizza did take around 15 minutes to fully cook, but it was a fresh pizza made from fresh dough and toppings so it's as expected. Definitely will return and I recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"#1 tip to my yelpers at Blaze - CHECK IN BEFORE YOU ORDER!  Each time I've been at Blaze, when I check in, I get an additional free pizza which makes it such a great deal!  The pizza here is pretty thin crust and a full pizza is just about right for one person if you're hungry.  If you just need a quick snack then it's also great to split.  There are some already thought up combinations or you can go down the line and add your own ingredients.  You can also start with one of Blaze's topping combos and customize them to your liking.  Here's what I've tried so far... White Top - MY FAVEEE!!!  White, sauce, bacon, mozzarella, garlic...what's not to love?  Highly recommend. Meat Eater - peperoni, crumbled meatballs, onion, mozzarella, red sauce.  Good, but not my favorite.   BBQ Chkn - grilled chicken, mozzarella, red onion, banana peppers, gorgonzola, and bbq sauce drizzle.  Surprisingly good, it may sound like an odd combination but everything together really works.  Another tip is that at the end of the adding your ingredients, have them put a sprinkle of sea salt and herbs on your pizza.  They don't overdo it and it just brings out the flavors that much more.  Definitely give Blaze a try for a quick and casual tasty meal!"}
{"text":"So tasty! Love the selection, fresh ingredients, and of course the pizza was amazing. I got the strawberry salad as well which was really great as well. The manager/owner (not sure which) came to check on everyone and was seen helping the cooks behind the counter as well which is always great to see. Definitely gonna hit this place up all the time!"}
{"text":"We always have enjoyed it here when they make our pizza while we are there but they kinda dropped the ball on our online orders.   The first time we ordered to pick up our pizza had the correct toppings but we had 4 or 5 slices that were the size of a tortilla chip and one giant slice the size of half the pizza.  The one big slice had a mountain of our toppings in a pile rather than spread around the pizza.  The second time we ordered for pick up, one of the pizzas had no sauce.  How do you forget to put sauce on a pizza???  We ordered one of their recipe pizzas as they come  and not a build your own so can't figure this one out."}
{"text":"No, it's not Una or Without Papers or even Bocce across the street, it won't change your life, but it's very, very tasty pizza, made with your choice of toppings, hot and fresh with a crispy crust that's almost as good as what you'll get at the aforementioned artisanal places, with fantastic friendly service, and prices are incredibly reasonable. I also like the aguas frescas and today got a small side salad (mozza without enough mozza but still very tasty); lunch for two of us was ample and only around $30. Like I say, it's not the best you've ever tasted, but at this price with great, fast service, it's pretty mich perfect."}
{"text":"The pizza was delish (chicken bbq), fast service and cheap. They have these fruit drinks by the soda fountain and they are addictingly good, especially the strawberry one. I would definitely be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"It's definitely fast and it's delicious. This location had a check in offer on yelp where you get a free pizza with the purchase of a pizza... Come on now, FREE designer pizza. Just go there!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and attentive. Pizza was very good, made fast and served up hot. Great fast food option. Try it for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, people are very friendly! Choose whatever you like, pizza done in 5 minute.  Recommend !!"}
{"text":"Good, fast pizza. Ideal for going with other people so everyone can pick their own toppings etc. the service is PHENOMENAL. Everyone was friendly and happy to be there. Only 4 stars because it isn't the \"best pizza I've ever had.\" But it is good!"}
{"text":"I don't know why in the world I didn't try this place sooner!!!! The staff is AMAZING - we had managers checking on us (and everyone else) the entire time we were there! I have never tasted more fresh, delicious pizza in my life! Unlimited toppings on your pizza - and there are TONS of options - for less than $8?!?! Where do you see that?????? You pick your sauce (I got light sauce, regular red sauce), shredded mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage, tonsss of pineapples, banana peppers, and all topped with BBQ sauce fresh out the oven! Amazing"}
{"text":"Just stopped here a few days after the opened and will definitely be back!   It was fast and delicious.   Love that you can add as many toppings as you wNt. I had the art lover and added pepperocinis and tomatoes.     Can't say enough good things about it!"}
{"text":"This is a different kind of pizza joint.  They say fast food pizza and that is what it delivers.  I tried three different kinds of pizza, all were flavorful and fresh.  The crust is thin and crisp - love that.  The beverages were unique, as well - blood orange lemonade was my choice.  This will not be a 'go-to' place, but definitely a in a rush and by myself choice.  The staff was very engaging and helpful, as well."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. Went tonight with my cousin to get pizza and when I was ordering the guy taking my order was too concerned with talking to the girl next to him than paying attention to what I was saying. Once the pizza got to the oven the guy putting it in spilled my toppings all over and when I asked it be redone him and another guy working automatically got an attitude and said they would just put more on it. As I'm trying to now tell a different person what's on it she  walked away and ignored me and I came home with a pizza that has topping on 2 slices. No customer service and extremely unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Fun place! A place where you can create your own pizza, its made quickly and its affordable - is a place that I can like! The crust is a little thicker than thin and delicious. I enjoyed the White Top of white cream sauce with mozzarella, applewood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula. They also had unexpected drink choices, \"agua frescas\" made with unique flavors I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza for a great price.  I'd recommend the high rise crust but the normal is good as well.  Definitely coming back before I leave the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"This is my second visit .  Both times I've had the Meat Eater with pepperoni meatball red onion mozzarella and red sauce .  Extra toppings for no charge so I add olives and a couple other items .  So good .  I also have the mozzarella tomato salad .  I'm pretty partial to Fired Pie but this is right by my apt and im digging it"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we came to the new Habit location right next to Blaze Pizza and were given a coupon for Blaze.  I am sure glad they did.  We have been back here 4 time since.  Love the SUBWAY style of pick and choosing of your toppings and being able to ask for more of this and more of that on the \"BUILD YOUR OWN\" Pizza.   Ingredients where fresh and tasty. I was surprise how flavor the ingredients where.  you could tell they were not the lower end ingredients the LARGE PIZZA CHAINS use.  They will pile your toppings as high as you like, give you extra cheese all for one low price.  VERY IMPRESSED how quick service was, and how friendly they are.  WE WILL BE BACKKKKK ............  If I could ask for one thing of them is that when your order is ready they bring it to your table instead of yelling your name across the restaurant which becomes intrusive and startling each time they yell some ones name."}
{"text":"Yesterday we drove 2 hours to meet my daughter for lunch. She pre-called the manager at BLAZE in Robinson Twp., PA  to ask about their gf pizza preparation. This is a build it yourself pizza restaurant adding whatever you WANT AND AT NO ADDITIONAL COST FOR TOPPINGS!   The manager Gary assured her they take gf very seriously and would take precautions.  Gary personally made my pizza. He changed gloves, used a clean area preparation away from the other pizzas and baked it in a clean oven area. The topping ingredients used were untouched by the wheat pizza handlers or they were taken from the back that were not in the assembly line yet. He personally was the only person to touch my pizza. They were very friendly taking extra care for gf and cc was not a problem. The pizza was amazing! I did not get sick! While eating I saw another celiac customer place an order and he took special care to prepare hers also. I look forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriends favorite place to go when we are in Pittsburgh.  We went there yesterday and ordered a total of 5 pizzas and it was done in about 10 minutes.  The veggies they have are so fresh and the staff is so accommodating.  There's really nothing even remotely negative about this place.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Pizza lovers will be pleased. During my first visit, was greeted by friendly staff and quick service. They explained how to build a pizza, but I decided to go with red vine signature pizza. It came out within 3-5 minutes. Crust is thin and crispy, sauce or cheese was a bit salty but overall good. I was planning to only eat half, but that didn't work out. Ate the whole thing! I do like that they post calories so you can keep track if you need to. I'll definitely be visiting again. The place very clean too."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, but the people assembling the pizza are slow and not really paying attention to what you are requesting.  It didn't help that the people in front of me were very needy. The cashier did a fine job."}
{"text":"We love this place! My husband is huge on mixing flavors and I'm more of a simple girl. They create perfect pizzas exactly to your liking. The staff is friendly and the wait time is practically nonexistent. The prices reflect the quality of the food so I'm not too bothered by them. Definitely check this place out if you like to create your own Frankenstein pizzas."}
{"text":"I think that I have tried almost all new pizza concepts, so I wasn't really knocked out that much about a joint where your pizza bakes in 180 seconds. Blah, blah, blah!  Well, I was extremely surprised by how much I liked the food at Blaze Pizza.  Blaze is not an artisanal pizza place and that's okay.  It fills the void between the local pizza joint/artisanal places and the \"normal\" chain store pizza restaurants.  The quality and the variety of the ingredients are DEFINITELY better at Blaze than they are chain restaurants and quite a number of local restaurants.  And, get this, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable.  Seriously!  I just took my daughter to Blaze the other day for our umpteenth visit since it opened and I was still amazed that I ordered a pizza with grilled chicken, pepperoni, salame, cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic, mushrooms, sautéed onions, spinach, zucchini, ovalini mozzarella, parmesan, mozzarella, white cream sauce and garlic pesto sauce.  I am not particularly a fan of extremely thin crust so I opted for their slightly thicker crust and my bill came to less than $11.  Fo real doh!  That pizza would have been a gazillion dollars at another pizza joint and it wouldn't have tasted as fresh.  When you have a high turnover of ingredients, you have a greater chance of having better quality and freshness.  Blaze Pizza has that in spades.  Me likey this restaurant and I think that you will too!  Great bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"The Staff Here Are Very Nice!!!  The Bathrooms Are Extremely Clean!!!  The Pizza Was Fresh & Tasted Good, Especially For Arizona (I'm From NY)"}
{"text":"Great place for groups, family night or a date night. Friday nights always a full house. Lunch time and late Saturday's less of a crowd. It's a build your own and choose an option from the menus. All pies are under $8. The lemonade (various options) is a great alternative to the soda fountain machine. They also have milk and water. I'm falling in love with this place! Pizza is Great!"}
{"text":"Fast, good quality pizza, and great manager/employees. I used to go to mod this place is better glad I found this for lunch a few months ago!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I found out about this location. I first got hooked on this place in Pasadena, CA. Now I'm SO SO SO glad they're in Phoenix, and close to me! Dangerous! I always get the white top and add toppings. The crust is always delicious. The size of the pizza is perfect for one person (eat half now, and \"save the other half for later\" haaa)  The toppings selection is wonderful. Various cheeses (goat, gorgonzola, ricotta, etc.), veggies, meats. Other fast pizza places don't have this wide of a selection I don't think, especially the cheeses.  Don't load up with TOO many toppings or it's more difficult to get that crust perfect, people!  Love the drizzles available too, but again, don't go overboard or you'll end up with a greasy pizza.  This location was clean and friendly. It's always a little loud because of the high ceilings and industrial design, so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"When the order is done correctly, it really is very good.  Unfortunately, it is a rare occasion that the pizza is actually presented as ordered.  I thought maybe this was just an issue with the online ordering, but when I decided to just pop in and order the pizza and wait, I experienced issues as well.  In addition, it is quite obvious that most of the employees at this particular location really don't want to be there and it shows in their \"masterpieces\".  They act bothered by every customer's presence, are skimpy with the toppings and almost always screw up some part of the pizza. The latest one I received resembled the Valdez oil spill instead of a balsamic glaze drizzle!  I guess I'll move on to a different place.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"An honest 3-star place for fast food pizza. Better than Dominos, et al., but if you want great pizza, find a real pizzeria, OTOH if you like flavorless junk like &pizza from DC this is a step up. It was ok for a a quick meal w/o sit down or the usual burgers or factory chicken. the crust is a little rubbery after it sits for a while. The toppings are ok but not first rate--gorgonzola livens up the boring mozzarella. Popular with families with little kids--eat outside or takeaway if you want to avoid a high decibel level."}
{"text":"So LeBron James calls this his favorite pizza. It is similar to BAKD pizza, Subway, Chipotle being a cafeteria style (assembly-style). Pick a Signature pizza or build your own.  Interesting to see the pizza press that presses the dough.  It is cooked for 180 seconds. Had a spicy red with pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers, pesto finish.  A thin crispy crust was good, not soft in the middle and not doughy.  The sausage is a sweet style & not my favorite but still a pretty good pizza that did not take to long for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can make your own pizza which is fantastic. I have struggled to find a good white pizza since living in New York. Here I was able to make a great one ok my own. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place to go to get a pizza. They have gourmet ingredients and you can add any ingredient you want. You go through the line and tell them what you want on your pie. They have different sauces and a variety of cheeses, along with veggies and meats. Then they put it in the oven and fire it for you. Its done quick and fast and tastes great."}
{"text":"Wow! I was driving by and saw this new place! Came in and WOW awesome food, service and location! Thanks guys! Oh  and the beer selection is awesome. Best to ya'!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is my favorite pizza place in the Pittsburgh area. The pizza is always consistent and well made at a good price! They do an exceptional job at keeping the Gluten Free items clear of cross-contamination, which is much appreciated! In addition, the staff pays attention to their customer, and knows my order, I don't event have to say a word and they know what I want! I love these guys!! I just wish they took tips with credit card payment, cause I never have cash on me!  I can't figure out how to respond to a compliment I accidentally approved with out writing back: Blaze asks if you need a glove change change if you ask for gluten free crust. They also have separate toppings and utensils."}
{"text":"For the price, convenience, and quality, Blaze is my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh! I love that I can pile on unlimited toppings from a fresh and colorful selection. Particularly, I love that Blaze offers minced garlic, fresh basil, and ovalini mozzarella as options.   The pizzas always come up piping hot and perfectly baked; the crust is thin, yet crispy.   On a recent visit, I discovered that they offer Matcha Fresca, which is absolutely delicious! The matcha flavor shines through clearly and the drink does not contain too much sugar (it is only 30 calories per serving).  Also, compared to other Blaze locations, I find that the line here moves quickly and efficiently. I'm impressed by the responsiveness of all the employees here: they really work hard to keep the line moving."}
{"text":"This is THE best pizza ever and I honestly hate pizza. My fiance, son, and I come to Blaze at least 5 times a week. Sometimes we go for lunch, othertimes dinner. I like Blaze because you can create whatever you are in the mood for (though I usually get the same), as much as you want with sooo many different possibilities. Customer service is key and every single employee has given us a positive experience. Epscially the chef (bing) who always makes sure our pizzas are PERFECT. The managers really care about your experience and even remember you as you become a regular (as do most of rhe staff). Pizza, salads, desserts, yummy lemonade, and pop... You won't regret stopping by. Goooo Blaze. Make sure to get the app- you can earn free drinks and pizza! See ya soon Blaze!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for great price, and fast!  We went with the Green Stripe, added mushroom and balsamic glaze, very good!  We also made our own pizza, with sausage, pesto, sauteed onion, mushroom, etc., which is also very good."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for pizza and really enjoyed the pizzas here! They do small individualized pizzas, with fresh ingredients and amazing sauce. A must try. They also have awesome fountain drinks, including prickly pear soda!   I had the art lover pizza and it was very tasty. You can make your own as well. There was quite a line when we showed up, so prepare to wait during busy times to place your order (however, it is worth it!)   Limited parking in the area, but there is public parking underneath the restaurant for a fee. Food was very reasonably priced. We had two pizzas for 26.00. Will definitely look forward to going back to Blaze!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very affordable pricing. They have the quality of pizza as other restaurants like Anthony Pizza but pricing way lower than Anthony's. Blaze is one of my favorite pizza shops in America"}
{"text":"My partner & I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a quick bite. He ordered the buffalo chicken pizza & I had a plain cheese with mushrooms. We both ordered a side salad. The salads were good and fresh & both dressings we tried were good. Both of our pizzas had a really strange charred taste. Upon further inspection, the underside of the crust had a black dust on it. I don't know if something was burned prior to ours or what, but it made the pizzas inedible. The have one of those new freestyle coke machines, which was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Blaze is our family's go to in Monroeville. Everyone always leaves full and satisfied. The service is speedy and friendly. Never had a bad experience and always recommend Blaze to friends and family."}
{"text":"I tried this place one time during weekday lunch.  It was pretty busy.  I felt the price was a little high and the pizza and salad options were not as good as the two other similar restaurants in the community.  The pizza itself seemed average.  My two go tos are Fired Pie and Pieology (across the street from Blaze)."}
{"text":"This place was SOOOOO AMAZING! April (the girl who made my pizza) was phenomenal! And Dom (the guy who cooked the pizza) cooked it to perfection with a crunchy crust and yummy gooey cheese. The whole crew there was on there game! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some truly amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Great for a light meal and the Manager Bill takes the time to greet you and make sure you are happy with your experience!"}
{"text":"This is like the Chipotle of pizza places! It's a novel idea and the concept does so well. I would like to see Piada also come to Pittsburgh some day.   Choices - wah! All the choices! Can't believe unlimited toppings are all up for grabs at one price! For $8, you may fill up your own personal pizza anyway you like it! I wish the signature pizzas were somewhere like $6 because it only includes 3-4 max toppings. I went a bit overboard and might have gotten around 10+ toppings and my only complaint is that they didn't leave it in the oven for long enough. My mushrooms, peppers and onions were barely warm. Yes, it would've helped if I didn't pile literally everything on my pizza but supreme is my usual to-go so this place made it so easy to go crazy with the toppings!  Also, please note that the spicy red sauce is legit pretty spicy. I needed to blow my nose afterwards.  Service - so nice! The employees at this location were super! Everyone in line said my name multiple times and answered my questions promptly. The cashier lady even grabbed my salad for me since it was at the beginning of the line. She later checked in on us to see how we liked everything. Very attentive!  Drinks - so good! The agua fresca choices (prickly pear and sweet mint lime) and lemonade (regular and blood orange) were unique, refreshing and da bomb!  How I wish this could replace any of those fast food burger places on Golden Mile Highway--goodbye Burger King or Wendys! The quantity is filling fo sho. I only managed to wolf down half my personal pizza so saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch. Good deal! I want to come back next time just to try the desserts!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Pizza made to order in front of you with a large selection of toppings and is just a good enough size for one or two people.  Staff was very friendly as well.  2 Pizzas with drinks came to about $20."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price! Super friendly staff! Love the build your own option. I actually went two days in a row after trying it for the first time. Would defiantly recommend !"}
{"text":"Love the pizza! I could never dine-in though. It's always soooooo loud in there, regardless of whether it's busy or not. Thankfully I live down the street so when I need a fix I can just take it home quick!"}
{"text":"Such great quality for the price and a great place to take kids. 3 minutes for a $5.50 cheese pizza that will feed two little ones!! Salads and desserts are good too."}
{"text":"Meh.  A solid meh.  I've come to terms with the fact that despite there being pizza every damn way you look, Pittsburgh just doesn't do good pizza.    Let's break down Blaze.  Pros:   you can get virtually whatever you want on a personal pie for around $8.   obnoxious vegans can rejoice as their crust is vegan and they have vegan cheese service has always been most excellent wood fired pizza gives pizza crust the BEST texture (you're just wrong, Chicago)  Cons:  I'm not sure they season anything.  Sauce is bland, toppings are bland, and crust is flavorless.  Sad day.   yes, it's a personal pie for $8 but I always have to get two to feel full because regardless of how much I top that thing, it's never filling.  Double sad day.    On paper, the pros outweigh the cons, however those are two mega big cons.  The food just doesn't have flavor and you walk out of there still hungry if you only order one pie.    This place is great if you're held up in Barnes and noble all day studying and need a bite, but don't expect killer pizza and don't expect to be full."}
{"text":"Great experience and some of the best pizza I've had.  It's basically the \"Chipotle\" of pizza joints.  You walk through the line choosing your sauce, cheese, toppings, or choose a signature pizza with the topics selected for you.  They then pop it in their open-flamed pizza oven and it's ready in a minute or so.  Has fountain drinks and several iced-teas, sort of like Panera.  Employees were walking around and picked up our tray for us once we were done.  Everyone was friendly.  Will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The only pizza i really enjoy is the red vine.  Other pizza joints disappoint when it comes to thin crust."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is a great concept, my first visit I enjoyed it, New building nice clean place yummy pizza we always support small businesses in the area.  The second time I came with my wife and bought three pizzas they were burned not sliced all the way it create so much mess, I did not enjoyed, it was a waste of my money I hope this review helps the owners to increase quality of this great concept build your own pizza I will give them another chance. I was really trying to be fair with my review.  I was there ON APRIL/25/2017  late evening"}
{"text":"Superior service and even better food.  Staff was extremely friendly and patient.  Food was out of this world. Will be a lifetime customer!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and although a bit overwhelming with the different choices- we LOVED it!! Perfectly cooked thin crust!! We had two pizzas- one was the one topping with pepperoni and red sauce and a BYO pizza that we had half pesto half white sauce with a bunch of different toppings including feta cheese and roasted garlic- all the toppings tasted great and fresh! Then the drink choices were great too including the strawberry lemonade and blood orange lemonade! Great prices, clean restaurant, amazing pizzas!! We found our new favorite pizza place close to us!!"}
{"text":"First timers here! We had a great experience at our local Blaze. We've been to \"build your own\" pizza places before and this one was great! The employees were helpful, the restaurant was clean, and the pizza was tasteful!   Unfortunately, I'm a very picky eater so we just had a plain ol' pepperoni pizza, but for all of you food lovers out there... there are so many options!   Side note: There's also multiple tasty looking salads!"}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza where you build your own.  Very fun and fresh!  Fast service.  So happy that yelp led me here.  Would come back for their excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Decent prices. Easy to order. This area has been needing a place like this for a long time."}
{"text":"Fast food pizza. Don't get too excited. Good for if you're in a rush or can't decide on larger \"pizza place\" Pizza. I'll be honest I was kind of overwhelmed with their menu board and just picked something that I later regretted after looking at the menu again. Staff wasn't really vocal in letting you know they'd call you back up when your pizza was ready so I awkwardly stood there waiting for my Pizza bc there's a big counter right in front of the oven. Cheese kind of tasted like plastic. Won't rush to go back but if someone suggests it for a quick option I wouldn't necessarily object."}
{"text":"This place was OK I think with Pieology just down the street and it's the same concept I would go there instead their ingredients seem fresher. But the customer service is really nice the staff was super friendly so I will give that a four stars for sure."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Salad had way too much dressing and the pizza wasn't up to par- not a fluffy crust like I like. The service was very friendly and accommodating!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good and a great price, i wish they had bigger pizza, with different sizes. I have not had the salad, but they also look very good. Overall good place"}
{"text":"I have tried a few of these create your own pizza places...Blaze was definitely the best! Pizza takes hot, fresh and delicious but most importantly the staff was friendly, the place was clean, and the variety of drinks and desserts was great. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is personalized pizza, how you want it.  They have three crust options (GF!) and millions of combinations for toppings and sauces. The staff is friendly and smiley and willing to answer any questions you have. They also have an order online feature-I can see this being very convenient for families, offices, or if you're just on the go! It's a little more expensive than your average pizza place, I paid $10.59 for a pie and a drink, but keep in mind you're probably getting more than you would if you got two slices-I took 1/3 home with me. It's pretty tasty pizza (coming from a New Yorker) and I will be back.   P.S. Blaze, please never get rid of the iced tea and lemonade, I enjoyed a nice Arnold Palmer with my lunch!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza!!! There are soooooo many combinations of pizza you can make.   I've tried all three crusts. Personally, I like the pesto crust, but I like to switch it up and get the gluten free option on occasion.   There are a few sauce options. I can't think of a time I didn't get the spicy red...it's pretty awesome and not too too spicy.   If you want cheese, they have it. Want lots of toppings? They have those too. On a diet? They make salads.   Oh yeah, I almost forgot...the first time I checked in at this location using Yelp, I got a buy one get one free coupon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a good price. We love to eat here. Their salads and deserts are great as well."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! My first time at a Blaze pizza place. It's just like a Subway or Chipotle where you can customize your order while walking down the line. The service was great. Very friendly and fast. Very cool to see the pizza oven cooking so quickly. Great deal for the build your own pizza... My husband got about 15 toppings so it was worth it! Very delicious! The tomato sauce was perfect and the crust was done just right! I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I can finally get a pizza with everything I want and not have my family complain! The agua Fresca is yummy. Pizzas are also made quickly. The wait isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Has a Chipotle/Subway style ordering process where you add your toppings as you go and the prices are great, $5.50 for a simple pie and $7.95 for a build your own that you can pack with toppings and they're a nice size that you can eat a whole one yourself if you're really hungry. The crust is thin and gets crispy on the edges in the oven but still soft in the middle. Good quality cheese that doesn't leave the pizza too greasy. Regular fountain Coke in addition to a few different options of soda with cane sugar as well as iced tea and flavored waters. After you pay it only takes a few minutes for your pizza to be done.  Last time we were there when my boyfriend's pizza was done they handed it to him and told him it was messed up so they'd make him a new one...it looked fine and he took it and started eating. He said one of the parts of crust looks like it bent in when they were pulling it out of the oven...which most people wouldn't even notice or care about. As we were eating, they brought out a newly made one in a box and asked how it looked and gave him a card for a free pizza next time. Both completely unnecessary but since customer service is basically dead, we really appreciate it and will continue to eat at Blaze."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious.  I appreciate the gluten free options. I had a green stripe pizza on gluten free dough and it was very good. He rest of the family did the build your own option and everyone loved their pizzas. The passionfruit agua fresca was very good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Artisanal pizza pie in around two minutes?  You betcha.  Wood-fired pizza is still preferred, but these gas-fired puppies are a close second.  But, what's not to love about your own customized, personal pizza for $8?  There are several signature recipes available that include fresh, well curated ingredients, but once you get the hang of it there are 101 ingredients to satisfy your craving.  They could benefit from a mic and speakers as trying to hear your name being called is akin to not hearing a damn word at a fast food drive-thru.  Now go git yer blaze on!"}
{"text":"Free pizza !!! Out of all of the pizza joints to customize pizza I appreciate that they offer high rise crust because I'm not a huge fan of the thin crust"}
{"text":"My husband & I are vegans , so there's not too many places we can go to around here . I was super impressed when I learned blaze had vegan cheese , so obviously it was my new fav spot when I had a craving take over . Even better , it's literally right up the street from my apartment . So one night , after leaving gym late and not wanting to cook we decided to head over . I called twice to be sure they were still open , as per their hours they didn't close until 10. No answer , and I called at 9:30..  When we pulled up it was 9:45 and there were still about 7-8 patrons inside of the restaurant . So I was super psyched ! I walked up to the doors and they were locked , I was kind of bummed but I could see someone coming to the front , and she was cleaning . I went to open the door again and she looked right at me , then proceeded to ignore me and continue her cleaning . Not only is it extremely rude to blatantly ignore someone , but if your hours say 10pm , and the place is still full , you should close AT 10PM ."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences and pizza places in Pittsburgh !! The customer service is hands down one of the best in the restaurant business !!  Welcomed with a smile, called on your first name basis, and thanked many times over for your business .  Class act place that makes you want to bring all your friends and family with you on the next visit !!  The pizza is amazing , with all the toppings you want, too many to list ...  and cooked to perfection and cut in slices to your liking !! Personal touch with every pizza they make !! Bravo Bravo Bravo !!  Even gave me a to-go box for the trip home !! Awesome Customer Service and Food !!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could.  Blaze is like the chiptole of pizza. For $8 you can get every single topping on their line.  The topping line up is also superb, offering 5 different cheeses, tons of veggies, and over 6 different meats.  The lineman was new and was so nice and let me make each half of my pizza different.  Also, the manger was super friendly and the place was very clean. I will be coming to Blaze for a long time."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! I went during a lunch rush on a Friday. Service was excellent! They have an efficient process up front in taking your order, assembly, paying, etc. A very loud and nice guy calls your name loudly when your pizza is done so you can pick it up. I say he was nice as he walked around to the patrons to check to see how everything was. Plenty of seating. Most importantly the pizza was good!! Sauce was tasty, dough was excellent-I even ate the crust. Ingredients were fresh! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So glad they have vegan options!! Not sure what vegan cheese they use but booooooy is it good. & do many veggie toppings my pizzas are always loaded up & for under $9, it's a great vegan win for something quick besides Taco Bell. Very fast, never had a rude employee, always had great pizza! Thank you blaze!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Perfect crust! I like how when I am very busy, I can order my pizza and pay through their app, then be in and out of the place very quickly."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by the description my friend shared of this place that I immediately visited this place for dinner. I like to think of this place as Chipotle for pizza.   We ordered the thin crust red vine pizza. However, we ended up adding a bunch of toppings of our choice and guess what...there was no extra charge for the toppings. they use a mechanical press kind of thing to press the dough into a pizza which was interesting to watch. And since the crust is so thing, cooking time is also fast with no compromise in the taste and quality.   I also tried cream soda. I am not sure if I like it or not. It is a new flavor for me and I might try again. The place is neat and the staff was helpful when I had questions about placing the order.    I look forward to going back again to build my own pizza."}
{"text":"My husband had been trying to get me to go to Blaze for about 2 months and my elusiveness finally came to an end. I'm not a huge pizza eater but the concept here is unique and the service was great. Dom took our order and was very helpful! He even gave me a free pizza coupon when I told him how much I loved my meal, truly awesome service. The prices are so reasonable too and it is a lot of bang for your buck.   They have regular pizzas you can order (think pepperoni, Hawaiian etc.) if you lack creativity but also let you build your own pizza. There are a ton of topping options and I ordered a white sauce pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions, garlic, cherry tomatoes and arugula. It was really good. I liked that the pizzas are personal size so you don't feel pressured to be gluttonous and eat a giant pizza. It was the perfect size for my husband who loves pizza and a dainty pizza dabbler like myself. They wood fire the pizza and you eat it right off of the pizza pan which doubles as a plate. The ambiance is good, casual with an industrial feel.   Diners are partially responsible for how their meal turns out; with great power comes responsibility. The pizzas here are wonderful as long as you don't pick weird food combinations. We will definitely come back!"}
