{"text":"One of few places that I know of where you can get soba noodle soup! The soba set is great...I usually get it with breaded chicken and the chicken is nice and crispy, lean, and there is a nice amount of meat...not just batter and a skimpy amount of meat with fat. I love that you can get multigrain rice too!   The half portion of Japanese curry and soba noodle soup is perfect for when you can't decide which one you want. The curry is flavourful, and smooth. Mmmmm yum!   Most of the time the server is the owner, she is very friendly, fluent in English (I read some reviews about bad servers), and very talented! She makes the desserts...the green tea layered crepes are DELICIOUS! If you order a pot of tea and a dessert it is a $7 or $8 combo (I love the soba tea!)"}
{"text":"Been here for the first time   I  really like the atmosphere of the place  It may be true that servera need to improve their English and I'm lucky that the manager was around she has fluent English  It may be a bit confusing when you first come it because the lounge and a ramen place are right next to each other   Also I like how the owner put effort into the place  I just visited today and they were having an Alice In Wonderland theme going on   I would definitely come here again and with friends"}
{"text":"We came here since Shiso Tree Cafe was closed for dinner preparations, and we desperately needed food. The place is clean and the decor is pretty cool- colourful lanterns and anime on the wall. When we went, I think we were served by the manager because there was no language barrier. I got the soba while my boyfriend got the curry. Both were good. Not spectacular because this seems more like a hangout cafe rather than a restaurant.  However, if that's the case, they should have a wider variety of drinks and desserts. We didn't get a chance to try either but if we're in the area next time, perhaps we will.  Overall, 3 stars because the place, food and service were pleasant."}
{"text":"If you have lots of time, and like spacious restaurant and want to be neglected by friendly servers and have some cheap decent homemade style food, look no further, give this place a try. If not, look further, like across the street, do yourself a favor and go to Nakamura or jtown by the sea.  During my visit, the servers were chatting loudly by the bar, much louder than the guests. This place is huge, it was very quiet with less than 10 guests eating here so I could hear all their conversation clearly. I sat there waited for a long time before one of them came to my table to take my order.   I only had the desserts, just wanted to eat something small so I can leave. The desserts were average, nice presentation tho. the mille crepe only had 10 layers, thick and chewy, so the cake probably stayed there for while. Chocolate and green tea Mille crepe are the only two options they have. Somehow the green tea one was reserved and not available until 5pm. Green tea ice cream was fairly sweet.   Pros: cheap home style Japanese food, loner and introverts friendly Cons: er...not so attentive servers and confusing store layout?"}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I visited J-Town and although the place looks the same, it seems there have been changes in restaurants. Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm for lunch and it was fairly quiet. The atmosphere reminded me of a food court with the dining area and retail area off to the side.  Food 2.5/5 I tried the soba lunch special which included a salad, soba noodles and protein (fried shrimp/pork) with a side miso soup and rice. Portion wise was perfect for lunch and each item was in its own bento compartment. I do like that there was a option to choose your salad dressing and protein dip. Food looked good but as I was eating my salad, I noticed what seemed to be a big piece of uncut lettuce. Upon closer inspection, turns out the kitchen left a wad of PAPER TOWEL as a nice addition to my salad. Thank goodness it didn't look used or stained but the server immediately apologized and the manager came back and gave me a free meal. When they did give me a new meal I steered clear of the salad just in case. Aside from the paper towel, the salad dressing had a light sesame flavor that wasn't too overpowering. Salad only consisted of lettuce and had 2 sad cherry tomato halves. In addition to it. Food wise it was all average; the pork katsu wasn't tender and a little dry for my liking. The soba comes mixed with a sauce but I would've liked it to have more of it.   Service 3/5 Like I said, after the paper towel incident they immediately came to fix the issue. I appreciate them owning up to it and not trying to make excuses. Other than that service was average, only saw the waiters when we ordered, dropped off our food and got the bill.   Overall I wouldn't mind coming back to this place as the food is decent. However I wouldn't expect anything amazing in terms of quality of food or service."}
{"text":"Layout of the restaurant is awkward and makes no sense. One side is the restaurant, other side is their display/shop.   Food: completely suck. We couldn't understand why they were so busy. Their gyoza was so oily and tasteless, their takoyaki ball was all filler and no squid with some nasty bright pink artificial ginger and their tonkatsu (pork) ramen was the most tasteless ramen we've had. There was three tiny pieces of pork with half an egg and two slices of artificial fish meat. Our meal ended up costing us $27. Definitely not worth it.   Service: they only had one server working when all the tables were filled. We knew she was super busy so we just waited for her to approach us to order. Finally, another server came to help her. The food didn't take too long to arrive but we had to ask her for serving plates and spoons.   Definitely would not come back."}
{"text":"After accidentally dining at Mifune I was determined to finally try out the Green Tea Lounge. I ordered the soba set, which is in my opinion a fair deal. You get soba, rice, your choice of fried item, salad and miso soup for under $10. Good portions too; just enough to fill you, but won't make you feel extremely bloated. My favourite part of the meal was the soba, which was great on a hot summer day. The rest of it was fairly average. Dessert menu however sounds overpriced, simple ice cream is around $4 or so for 2 scoops of flavours such as green tea or sesame, which can both be bought at asian supermarkets. Also service is kind of weird. Walked in, waitress greeted us but didn't tell us where to sit. I had to confirm with her that it was ok to sit anywhere I wanted because she didn't say anything. But other than that no major issues with service.  Environment is also quite neat! There are manga-esque murals on the wall, one of which is just a sketch near the kitchen awaiting completion. They also have a blackboard with a historical figure of the day complete with drawing and description which I found kind of neat.  Overall this is a neat place to have an affordable lunch, but may not be good enough for me to keep coming back to it though."}
{"text":"Marginally pricey for lunch but meal was balanced, nutritious, and quite tasty.  Got the soba combo with breaded shrimp and multigrain rice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It wasn't busy so we were seated quickly. I had a ramen-takoyaki combo friend got an udon. We had the chicken karage to share. The ramen was a little salty, but the cha siu was pretty tender and good. The udon broth was good and I think overall had a better flavour than the ramen. The takoyaki was good as well. The karage was a little dry and tough to chew. It was well seasoned, but dry.  Overall was a decent lunch, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents and we enjoyed it. The inside of the restaurant is pretty, the service was courteous, and the food was overall pretty good.  We started with some Takoyaki ($6.90). You get 6 to an order. I enjoyed it, but I found the batter a tad too soft and mushy.   They have quite a few lunch specials. I got the Bento Box lunch special ($10.90). You get to choose your main from a short list and I got the chicken katsu. You also get a choice between white rice or multigrain (I got multigrain). It comes with miso soup, cold soba noodles, and a salad. You also get a choice of dipping sauce, and I got the ketchup-style one.   I found the chicken katsu a bit over- fried. It was a little too dry and crunchy for my liking, but it was still good. The salad was mostly iceberg lettuce (this is common for salads that come with Bento Boxes), but it also had cucumbers and a grape tomato. Veggies were fresh and I liked the citrusy vinaigrette. The rice was cooked nicely and I love the texture of multigrain rice. The cold soba was good too. It was in a soy-based sauce with some seaweed sprinkled on top. The miso soup wasn't all that hot (temperature-wise), but at least it wasn't too salty. It had some chunks of soft tofu in it.  My dad got the half ramen and half curry combo ($11.98). He chose the Tonkotsu Soy Sauce Ramen. This came with 2 pieces of karage, 2 pieces of fish cake, some bamboo and half a soft boiled egg.  The curry was a vegetable curry (I think it was mostly root vegetables) and it came with white rice. He said he liked the ramen, but didn't think the curry was anything special.   My mom got the half-ramen with 3 Takoyaki balls combo ($12.98 because she chose the Chasu ramen, other ramen would only be $11.98). Her ramen came with 5 pieces of Chasu, 2 slices of fish cake, some bamboo, and half a soft boiled egg. The Chasu was lean and tender. My mom enjoyed her ramen.  The Green Tea Lounge is a cute little place to get Japanese food in the J-Town Shopping Complex."}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of the J town complex. The food is simple but tasty. I had the kitsune sobe...good stuff. They have other lunch sets that all looked pretty good. Everything is reasonably priced. The service on the other hand was pretty terrible. Lots of waiting...my food came out first and my sister had to watch me eat for a while before her food came out. One of the waitresses (who's parents own J town) was doing some paper work while we waited for our bill and others waited to be seated. For a weekday lunch I found all this waiting unacceptable. If you're at J town and want a simple lunch (and have lots of time) check this place out...if not, it's not with the drive to Markham!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, wasn't too busy. Third time here and would recommend a lunch (or dinner) if you're ever in J-Town.   Came with a party of 4 at 7pm and didn't need to wait for a seat, (food stops at 8:30 by the way).   Appetizers  Chicken Karage 3/5 - not crispy and the chicken was kinda thin and chewy. Not as good as the karage at Donburi or even Taiwanese popcorn chicken from Destiny's.  Takoyaki 5/5 - Definitely worth a try here, freshly made and some of the bigger octopus pieces I've had in takoyaki  Dinner  As a group we ordered a tempura udon, breaded chicken curry, shio ramen and sashimi dinner bento. I'll only review the dinner bento since that's what I had.   If you're looking for sushi or sashimi specifically, this place probably isn't for you. You'll get much more fish elsewhere like Gal's. But, if you're hungry and want variety, it's not bad. The box can be customized, mine came with a salad, tofu, California roll, 6 pc tempura, and 5 pc sashimi.   The tempura sauce is not sweet like you'd get at AYCE places; this seemed lighter, but salty. Also the sashimi pieces were small, definitely not slices like their menu depicted. Maybe they were running low.  From their website, \"...most Japanese families don't eat sushi and tempura too often cuz it is a hasle to make at home. When I eat at home, I usually have udon, soba, curry, breaded meat, and always rice and miso soup. So, the concept of the Green tea Lounge is \"what we eat at home\".\" So, based on this notion, i think they deliver as promised."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch, they have unique combos and I like how you can customise them. I got the soba set and everything was in good proportiobns . Multigrain rice was soft and went well with chicken cutlet and soba.   It took really long to get our food but they were apologetic about it and they gave us 10% discount and free ice cream which was very nice. The decor seems a bit outdates but it feels homey there."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try last night with my friend. Nice little cafe. Had the Soba set with chicken. Chicken is a tad dry, but everything is tasty. The best part of the meal is dessert, I had the black sesame ice cream. The ice cream isn't super sweet and can taste the black sesame. Overall the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Prices are cheap here but the portions really lack in size to make anyone full. Tried their udon and curry on rice dish. Taste was sub par.  Nothing special. Would eat at another restaurant in J Town if you can.  Also see the photo of the green tea mille crepe with black sesame ice cream, tiny... a few bites and done.  This is a very casual restaurant and it is shared with a ramen/noodle place.  Maybe their other cakes and tea combos are better?"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to get Japanese style curry. I anyways get the chicken katsu curry, my boyfriend usually ops out and gets the dinner bento.  The curry is really homely and quite actually filling. However more recently I think the recipe has changed. The curry has a lot more of a spice to it, and there are not as many vegetables (potatoes, carrots) in it as well.   The bento comes with rice (white or multi-grain) choice of fried protein and soba. I loveeeeeeee the pickled cucumbers it comes with! Even though I hate actual pickles LOL.   All in all it's a cute hidden store in j-town. The staff are very friendly, and there is an anime mural that has been incomplete since I started coming here years ago."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after deciding not to wait at Izakaya Ju and was found Green Tea Lounge to be an average japanese diner. I am not sure if I would return but it did the trick in that scenario.   It has the tendency to be overlooked by many as it is in the corner of the plaza but inside you will find a spacious and cozy place while also oddly selling various household wares.  They seemed to sell a lot of combos and that is a good thing if you like variety. A lot of diners were getting the curry so we ordered one as well with the cheese and it was very enjoyable. It arrived on a hot plate and nice and warm. The curry was mild and flavorful but unfortunately there's no proteins so you had to add one. We got the chicken karaage and it was pretty underwhelming devoid of crunch and juiciness so I'd avoid that. The set came with warm soba which was also decent but nothing special.   We also ordered the bento and you had the freedom of choosing various sides and dressing. The pork cutlet was alright, wasn't particularly dry nor juicy. The miso dressing was good, and the rice was a very hearty blend. The cold soba was very good with the chilled miso dipping sauce. I really liked the addition of the japanese pickles and how comprehensive the meal was ending with ice cream.   Service was fair, value was a bit pricier considering the amount and quality of food, which makes it hard to fully recommend this place."}
{"text":"The lunch special was a tad bit pricey. However, the quality of the food makes up for the higher prices. Soba noodles and chicken katsu were really good! I've heard good things about their desserts and I'm definitely down for trying them out. Will stop by again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Soba set dinner with Chicken cutlet was the perfect portion. Love how delicate the portions are measured to allow no food to be wasted on the plate. I love how we get to choose multigrain rice, texture was perfect. Friendly server, decorations may need some touchup,booth seats cushions were a bit stained. Overall, the taste of the food was good."}
{"text":"Decent place for Japanese curry. I had the shrimp tempura curry, the flavour wasn't too spicy and the curry had a nice flavour. Portion could be bigger but I also had takoyaki so maybe it was better that the portion was smaller. The shrimp tempura were a bit too overcooked, the batter wasn't the best but wasn't horrible. I would reorder curry but I would try the chicken instead. The takoyaki was good, fair size chunk of octopus and the toppings were good not too sweet.  It's a good spot if you are in the area and want a quick and decent service. It wasn't my first visit and I will definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"I won't be returning to the Green Tea Lounge.  The place has a bit of a run down feel to it.  The scuff marks left by the table on the wall, for example.  The service was friendly, but my main problem is that, for two of us, the first meal arrived ten minutes before the second meal did.  That's a rookie mistake.  Who serves two meals ten minutes apart?  Really bad.  The food is okay, but not stellar.  The pork ramen only had a few small pieces of pork.  There are loads of ramen places in Toronto where you can get better.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Although it sounds like it's the same entity as the Green Tea Cafe in the main J-town shop, they actually offer somewhat of a different menu (no hamburger steak :(), but the curries and the noodles are there, though they're not exactly the same either. If both places are open, I would recommend going to the cafe location unless you're coming for desserts.  I was here for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was empty. The interior looks kind of like a school cafeteria so it sort of felt a little lonely eating here when it's so dead. It's not meant to be a fancy place, it's supposed to be Japanese comfort food, so I can't really complain about the ambience much.  While it's supposed to be comfort food, I didn't think the prices reflected that, particular for the dinner boxes. I got a sashimi dinner box that was $20, which I probably could've got at another place for $15 - especially given that the main part of the bento box was just a salad. It was actually my second dinner of the night (had a fairly late lunch) and I was able to finish all of it - I doubt you'd get full from it if you were really hungry.  The quality of the food in the bento box was decent though. I wasn't expecting anything good from the sashimi based on the picture (even though they're right next to the fish market..), and neither should you. The mackerel I got was good, but grilled mackerel really isn't hard to mess up - it's essentially what you would get from any basic Korean restaurant. The sauce on the salad was bland, and they probably should tell the customers to add soy sauce to the cold tofu (the way hiyayakko is supposed to be eaten), or else you're just eating plain cold tofu. What was surprisingly good was the multigrain rice lol, I would never order that anywhere because I've always preferred white rice but for some reason this place has multigrain rice that's so good I would get that over white. Odd. You might also be surprised that this place has the best gyoza I've ever had in the GTA, but it's not a gyoza shop so I don't really think it adds much value to the overall restaurant.  I've never tried the desserts though but they look good, I would definitely be willing to come back and try them. The service was also super friendly and efficient. Even though they were closing up, they never rushed us to leave and let us take our time. I'm not against coming back here either, I just think that I would rather hop on next door to the cafe instead for their hamburger steak."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch combo sets. One breaded chicken and one teriyaki chicken. The mixed rice option was very tasty! I am going to try to cook that rice on my own. I added on the green tea milli crepe dessert and black sesame ice cream. I was charge more than what the menu stated which I really hate so 1 star off. Service was very fast and friendly. Decor was a bit old and worn out but the awesome anime drawing on the back wall made up for it. 4 stars for solid food and service. 1 star off for higher than expected prices compared to the menu. ****"}
{"text":"Lovely Japanese cafe for cake & simple noodle!  Lunch specials available!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a light lunch that tasted good at the same time and this place definately accomplished that.   Cold soba $10.80 - comes with shrimp tempura and a rice wrapped in a thin layer of tofu I think. The noodles tasted nice when dipped in the sauce. The shrimp tempura was large and fresh. I especially liked the rice wrap. It had a hint of sweetness and tasted great. One of the healthiest meals I have had all week. No wonder the Japanese people live so long.  Tempura udon $10.80 - came with the same shrimp tempura and rice wrap. Noodles a bit on the soft side but still had that chew which I like.  After seeing all the pictures of the crepe I had to try one even though I am not a huge fan of crepes. Green tea crepe $5.80 with black seseame ice cream +$3. Comes with whipped cream and fresh fruits. There were probably a good 7-10 layers for the crepe and it this is probably the first crepe I have ever liked. It went well with the whipped cream and ice cream.   Service was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"We were at J-Town to pick up groceries; it coincided with lunch so decided to eat at Green Tea Lounge.   My sister and I waited to be seated, but the server just awkwardly watched us without any greetings - definitely a stare down there. We took the reigns and just sat at an open table. About 5 minutes later, menus and tiny glasses (slightly bigger than shot glasses) of water were brought to us. I had the Soba Set lunch; for under $10, it's a great price considering you get a salad, miso soup, 3 pieces of ebi fry, rice and soba. I have no reservations to say that I enjoyed the meal; could it be that I was hungry and had to watch my sister eat her meal for 5 minutes as I waited for my food? Once the meal was finished, asking and getting the bill seem to take an eternity.   This restaurant has great potential (the food is pretty good and reasonable), but management/the owner should invest in developing service.  Good for: eating lunch if at J-Town with a lot of time on your hands"}
{"text":"Curry rice with pork cutlet : curry is so so. You can buy the Japanese brand curry package from supermarket and make exact the same taste. port cutlet is too thick  Beef tataki: very nice"}
{"text":"For being a Green Tea lounge, their Matcha tea is just terrible. I had to send it back because there wasn't enough matcha in it. It tasted more like water, than it did matcha.   My friend had the exact same issue. We stopped by after dinner in the area, and wanted to have desserts. The waiter actually warned us that the mille feuille (which was the only dessert left besides icecream) was quite old.   Too many things wrong in one visit to warrant me to want to go back.  However I'm giving this place three stars because the service was good, the interior was interesting and the food menu looked great."}
{"text":"I've been to Green Tea Lounge since it opened and it seems to be going downhill. By no means is it bad but the quality of the food just doesn't seem as good as it used to be.  My most recent visit was for their dinner Sashimi Bento. You get to select a variety of options for your bento. When I opted for California Rolls, they told me they were out of avocado and tried to offer me cucumber rolls. Having no choice i just went along with it. When the bento arrived, there was avocado... I'm guessing they ran across to the supermarket to pick one up.  My favourite part of the bento was their Tempura. You get quite a few pieces and the variety is nice. Some pieces of tempura you don't usually find which is great.  The restaurant furniture is starting to get a bit beat up... Especially the booths. They are quite dirty at this point with the fabric seating.  This place is still worth a visit but probably not the first choice in J Town"}
{"text":"Man can u even call this Japanese food...the curry combo is just some curry powder mixed with water served with some rice and 3 tiny pieces of carrot. Can u really open a restaurant and serve that as a dish?   The tempura don is some sad thin pieces of vegetable tempura put on some rice.   The soba and udon noodles that come with it are as plain  as they could possibly be.   The level of effort in these dishes makes me feel like anyone who can boil some water and purchase some powder seasonings can open a restaurant.   Total waste of time and money and life to come here."}
{"text":"I came here last week because when we visited Shiso Tree next door, lunch was already over, so I thought I'd give this place a try.   The soba was average, it seemed a little to floury, but everything else was really good. Curry had a good taste, and the cutlet was cooked well.  The cold tofu was my favourite dish, I liked it so much I ordered another plate!   I'd definately come back for lunch again, though I wish their dishes was a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried Mille Crepe cake?  Love this dessert.  It is a fancy and elegant French no-bake cake consisting of paper thin crepes with many layers with flavourful cream between each layer.  It is a common pastry in Japan where you can even find it in the 7-eleven convenience store.  I believe that Mille Creperie located on Baldwin St downtown was the 1st place in Toronto that specialized in this cake.   In the last few years, you can find this cake in many places like Bake Code, Roselle, Daango (Baker Siu), and Green Tea Lounge.  In some of these places, they may have more than the one  vanilla flavour, like mango, matcha, earl grey, and chocolate.   My favourite is still the original vanilla flavour.  I like ordering the Mille Crepe cake here at Green Tea Lounge because it's tasty and the price is reasonable.  It's $40 for the 10\" (I think?) which is a real good price.  However, the cake has less layers so it's not as high as it should be.  But it's delicious and I like how it's presented with the fresh fruits on top.  Make sure you place your order 7 days in advance.  If you're in the area, you can always just get a slice to try.  I usually see that they have at least one crepe cake that you can buy by the slice."}
{"text":"Green tea crepe cake = layers of green tea flavoured crepe which stacks to form into a solid mass of moist and spongey dessert.  The weird texture and awareness that \"this is a cake made up of paper thin crepes\" is just so fantastic and different from the everyday slice that you must try it to experience something different from the ordinary.  Coffee jello: this is a staple Japanese dessert and there's nothing wrong with it if you like coffee and fresh cold gelatin desserts.  Normal cup of coffee + the food presentation: so nice to finally be served food in a public place on proper bone china."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Sablefish - had sashimi lunch bento with Sablefish with miso.  Fish was well cooked and tasted great. 2. Interior - Spacious dining area with Japanese decor and shop off to the side.  Felt very JTown.   Bad: 1. Price: For a $16 lunch, I would expect more than the standard rice, salad, soup, main combo with a meagre 5 small slices of salmon and whitefish.  Worth it? No on this one.  I think $10-12 would've delivered reasonable value but at $16 I would be looking for either more quantity or better quality than standard fare."}
{"text":"I love Green Tea Lounge's concept of serving Home Style Japanese food. Simple and delicious.  I love the idea of able to customize my Soba Set ($9.80) the way I prefer from the salad dressing (sesame mayo), the protein (breaded pork), the dip (sweet miso sauce), the rice (multi-grain).   It was quite filling and the pork just prepared perfectly: juicy and tender inside, crunchy and crispy outside. I think I going to order the Curry with Breaded Pork ($9.80)!!  There is also some small bite (Natto for my Yelp friend?) or some sweet.  As the name implies, they also serves pots of loose leaf tea and even Matcha Tea.  Service is friendly and cheerful. The waitress has this cutest smile just like the girl next door...  I usually go to Cafe Green Tea for a quick bowl of noodle but they closes early at 7 pm every night.. now I know where I can get some home style Japanese food for dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. Completely walked by this place, it's so inconspicuous, located beside Shisho Tree Cafe. As others have mentioned, it is a shared space between two restaurants, Niwatei (I think) and Green Tea Lounge, so that is a little bit confusing. But the staff here are really nice, there was one main girl working, and unlike what other reviewers have mentioned, I thought her English was perfect and she was actually very helpful at answering questions.  The food is simple, Japanese comfort food. Curries, sushi, ramen, soba noodles, bentos, etc. I got tempura soba noodles because I wanted to try something different. It's nice that they ask whether you want the tempura on top or on the side, so that you don't have to have soggy tempura. You also get two inari on the side. I thought the tempura was great, very light and crispy. Inari was standard. Noodles were also pretty good, and the broth tasted light and naturally flavoured - I wanted to drink all of it at the end. Afterwards my friend and I both got some dessert to share. We tried the green tea mille crepe as well as the coffee jello with vanilla ice cream, and both of them were really good! In the end we each threw in a $20, which was a steal considering the amount of food we both ate.  The restaurant wasn't very busy, and while our server was nice, there were times when she got caught up chatting with some of the other patrons or some of her friends or something. Luckily we weren't in a rush to get anything, but I think she could have been a little more attentive or could have come to refill our water more. I would still recommend this place though for a casual meal, great value for your money!"}
