{"text":"Amazing steaks! Can't wait to go back! Awesome place but a little pricey! Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"We attended a business dinner there last week and all 6 of us enjoyed our meal and service.  it is one of the better steak places in Scottsdale.  Definitely not the same old thing for the area."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners and appreciate a good experience where ever we go. We were really looking forward to a great steak dinner and prepared to drive from south Chandler and pay the high price for a great steak. It was my sister in laws birthday after all! Then to find out they were one of the restaurants participating in Restaurant Week was even better! We could get a great dinner with salad and dessert included for only $40! 

When we approached the restaurant we were greeted by a young lady. Not to sound snobby but she was wearing a casual dress with tennis shoes! Yea, tennies! We had reservations (which appeared were not necessary, because they were not busy) and were sat right away. 

After we reviewed their every day menu and the Restaurant Week menu we asked what the difference is with the $40 filet on the every day menu versus the filet on the Restaurant menu that comes with salad, sides and dessert. He responded, 8oz compared to 12oz, other than that, nothing. So easy decision, no way can I eat 12oz of steak anyway. I ordered med-rare+, it came rare. My sister in laws filet looked like road kill and also undercooked. So they had to be taken back to the cook. My husband 12oz sirloin was more like 4oz. Smashed potatoes were bland and the broccoli undercooked. The desserts were so small I finished it in two bites. I guess they were conservative since they were only getting $40 from each of us. We ordered two bottles of wine which we were over charged so our bill needed to be adjusted. The service was not at all what you would expect from a restaurant to charges an average of $50 a steak and everything else is al la cart and who has an over $2100 bottle of wine on their wine menu. And when we asked to substitute mashed potatoes for a backed potatoes we denied!

If steaks are your specialty and you honestly feel you can justify your prices then your service should match it. If you cook steaks all day long one would think you would get it right the first time and not have to be returned to the cook. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning nor referring our friends. Too bad."}
{"text":"I came with my dad because I met the chef and the manager at a culinary festival. Never heard of the place before, walked in the atmosphere was very nice and same with the hostess. She was very adorable and probably the nicest person in the place besides the chef. We thoughth the lobster was a little over cooked but over all everything was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I was a visitor in Scottsdale This last weekend and enjoyed most of what Scottsdale restaurants offer however when trying to reserve a restaurant there were limited non chain restaurants available in the 6:30-8:00 range, so low and behold every time was open at Ben and Jacks. Let's begin by walking in the door, the hostess was cordial and inviting, the manager on duty happily stayed at the bar with his phone in hand seemingly uninterested in the events of the evening. The hostess seated my group of 4 in the center of the dining room where it was so dark I couldn't see my plate, I asked to move and was accommodated. The dining room had 5 tables filled with nearly 15 open and this was Saturday evening at 7:30pm. The server was friendly but didn't seem to understand how the food was prepared when simple questions were asked. The food came out epically wrong. A steak house that saturates it's so called 28 day dry aged steak in sizzling butter like a fajita plate at Applebee's simply decimates the quality of the meat. My table asked for medium rare on an assortment of cuts and all came out charred and rare, nearly in edible. The appetizers for a special order came out wrong and the server questioned me when prompted about the mistake. There were 2 servers that came out throughout the meal and the synergy was unimpressive. The bill was average for a steakhouse however the overall bullet points that a fine dining experience should hit simply misfired. Extremely disappointed and would strongly suggest ANYONE to reconsider the blasphemous anecdote that chain restaurants suck to reconsider because You most likely enjoy everything about not going to Ben and Jacks. Ben and Jack if on premise should reconsider there sever positions back in Brooklyn and stay out of the drivers seat."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic and the portions were extremely generous. I had a glass of Pinot Noir and it had great flavor and paired well with everything I ate. The caesar salad had a very light dressing and was one of the best I've ever had. I had the Salmon and it was cooked just to my liking and I had over half to take home. I had pecan pie for dessert and it was as good as the kind my grandma makes. The service was impeccable and the manager Danny was incredibly helpful. I would suggest this to anyone. They also played great music and I felt as though I was in A NY steakhouse, not Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ben & Jack's in Scottsdale gets it. They know what it takes, how hard they have to work, to be as good as they are. They are indelibly good in all the things that matter: food, drink, staff, service. Paul the bartender's icy concoction \"The Caputini\" is  stunning before or apres dinner. If there's room, the old fashioned sundae makes for delicious and romantic sharing.  My husband's Chicago style steak was perfectly charred, tender and flavorful.  When he declared it the best steak he's had, it was as if doors opened and members from the kitchen and management descended to share their craft and history of how Ben & Jack's came about.  A memorable evening with a masterful Antonio as our server and orchestrator of every delightful choice."}
{"text":"Surprised by all the negative reviews of Ben and Jack's on Yelp. My family and I enjoyed a fantastic dinner here recently. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Decor is old school, but clean white table clothes are always appreciated. Salads were crisp, even though coated in dressing.  Bottom line a restaurant like Ben and Jack's is all about the steaks, and the steaks (filet and NY strip) were top notch and prepared to perfection.  Cream spinach and french fries were delicious - skip the onion rings.  My wife enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. Hot fudge sundae was seriously old school and delicious. Adding Ben and Jack's to a list of new favorites."}
{"text":"My favorite high end Restaurant in Scottsdale, period. I have dined here well over 20 times and every experience I've had has been a wonderful one. From the friendly bartenders and waitstaff to the GM that always comes by and genuinely asks us about our experience. I really have no idea why there are negative reviews on here.

They essentially copied everything Peter Luger does with their steaks in NYC-and trust me, that is a wonderful wonderful thing. Even the bar has an opulent NYC feel to it.

The true reason to come here of course, is the food. This place-in my opinion-is perfect for two reasons: 
1) You can drop a ton of money on a perfectly cooked steak on a sizzling hot plate to continue to cook to your liking. It's pre-cut in that Peter Luger style.Individually dry aged for 25-30 days, it is literally a tender \"prime\" piece of heaven. Is it one of the more expensive steaks in Scottsdale? Yes. It it worth every dollar? Yes.
2) The best value in town- Filet Mignon bites. Do I have $100 to spend on a steak for two on a regular basis, that would definitely be a negative. Lucky for me, B&J has the perfect menu item to satisfy my taste buds and my wallet. For less than $14 you can get a heaping mound of dry aged prime filet mignon with 2 delicious sauces-it has to be over 3/4 a pound every time. It is cooked in the exact same remarkable style as the steak and is only available at the bar. It is literally the most tender and delicious filet I have ever had-and remarkably consistent. If you are ever thinking of going somewhere for a steak and you want to spend less than $20 on your food- give this place a try and eat like a king. I'm telling you, try it once and you won't regret it. Word to the wise, drinks here are a little pricey so give it a try during happy hour (the home made potato chips you get as a pre-meal snack are simple and mouthwatering)...

One more thing, part of the reason I like coming in here is the experience I receive from the staff. It's nice to know i can go into a very fancy steakhouse with my wife and spend a whopping $30 and be treated the exact same as the customer spending $300. The service, experience, welcoming atmosphere and meat that has me daydreaming for 4:15 to arrive will have me coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Uneven - at best

Visited for Restaurant Week on 5/18.  Had high expectations as the restaurant had been mentioned by AZ Central restaurant critic as a place to try.  One of us ordered the salad and one the canadian bacon.  The salad was OK, just lettuce but the dressing was tasty.  We notice other diners having the same salad had additional ingredients like tomato and onion.  I think of canadian bacon as very lean, the bacon served was not.  Didn't really care for it that much.  For dinner, one of us had the sirloin and the other the filet medallions.  Again, not what I would consider high quality beef and the sauce on the medallions was extremely salty.  The mash and broccoli served with it were uninspired and pretty much unseasoned.  The carrot cake for desert was flavorless.  Our server was just OK, and we didn't appreciate having to overhear the servers vying for tables.

Sounds like it's the luck of the night whether or not a dining experience here will be good or not so good.  We're frequent diners and it's unlikely we'll be back."}
{"text":"There was nothing redeeming about our experience here aside from the company we were with! Party of 12, bill $1,000+ no auto gratuity and they charged $10 for a birthday dessert??? 

Food was mediocre on a good day - steak = blah, sea bass = tasteless (though will say it was a decent portion size, but for $40 I expected a bit more), sides = bland & over priced for size of the dish. 

All in all I could have spent $90 less (ended up being $100/pp) and been content with a $0.99 cheeseburger from McDonalds and a $10 bottle of wine from the store! 

I do NOT recommend and will NOT go back. Many other places in the valley and in Old Town to get a phenomenal dining experience for the price vs this place. Be forewarned..."}
{"text":"Went there in the heart of spring training on a Saturday night.  This was the third time that I've eaten there, since I love the similarity to Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn. There were four of us. They brought out a very disappointing bread basket that didn't stand up to their competition.  We shared a Caesar salad, their tomato (mealy and tough) and mozzarella, and the Canadian bacon starter. For our entrée we had their signature steak for three. The steak was very good and served at our requested temperature. The biggest negative of our dining experience was our waiter. He was overbearing and very intrusive. He kept using the phrase, \"for the lady\" and \"for the \"sirs\" so much we laughed every time he said it. He screwed up our drink orders which took a long time to get to begin with."}
{"text":"Mediocre steak and too high prices for the quality of the steak.  Mixed green salad was also mediocre. Service was very attentive. For these prices and this quality, this restaurant will not last. Very disappointing food."}
{"text":"Went to the acclaimed Ben and Jacks after discovering the owners story thought we would give it a shot, quite unfortunate and felt cheated, the food was poor quality and prepared poorly, while half the waitstaff was knowledgable and seemed moderately enthused to be employed while others couldn't be bothered. Dry Aged was not noticeable and the temp was way off, why the kitchen would cut my steak without asking is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been to Ben & Jack's on fifth ave in New York a few times, for work related events. So when I went to Scottsdale in December I figured I would give this one a shot. I loved the decor of the place, it had a very New York, steakhouse feel. They have a long wine list and the bartender will pretty much make any cocktail you request. The menu featured many of the items from New York with a few fun extras. I ordered the filet mignon medium-rare and my friend had her filet mignon medium. Both were cooked properly and you can tell that the steaks are dry-aged the right way. The sides are good, and service was friendly. I am going back to Scottsdale in a month and have reservations already."}
{"text":"Went tonight for first time and won't be returning!  Had reservation for 7 and was seated within a few minutes and then it all went to hell after that!  Waited 20 minutes to place drink order, 25 minutes after that someone finally took our food order and after being there for 1.5 hours with no food delivered  to our table we decided to walk out without eating.  To charge $75 dollars a plate and have such poor service is outrageous this place is by NO MEANS a fine dining establishment would not recommend anyone who desires a quiet atmosphere, good food and good service eat here because you will leave highly disappointed"}
{"text":"We went here because it was within walking distance of our hotel. We were seated and then greeted by Julio, who gave us the background  of Ben and Jacks, and info on how they age the meats. He advised us the sides were huge, served family style. We started out with the Ben and Jacks house salad, which was fantastic! I will try to duplicate it, with Canadian bacon, shrimp pieces, tomatoes, onions, blue cheese crumbles. All 3 of us loved it! My sister ordered the seafood primavera, so much seafood and a bit of pasta. She said the Alfredo sauce was perfect, light and flavorful. My husband had the ribeye, cooked to perfection. I had the filet mignon, very ample portion which I did not finish. The side of mashed potatoes could have fed 4 people. We wished we had left room for dessert, they are all made in house. I highly recommend Ben and jacks!"}
{"text":"Go here before they close down !!!

We has a wonderful dinner here. It was eerily slow for a Friday night.  We bellied up to the bar and had a couple Martinis and some raw bar appetizers.  The shrimp were incredible some of the best we've ever had.  The bartender - Harry - knows how to make old school cocktails.

We sat down for dinner and were greeted by an old time waiter who provided very good service.   we started with their bacon appetizer.  You have to try if for the heck of it and it is very unusual, but very good.  We moved on to the Caesar salad which was excellent - best I've had in town for sure.  We ordered the porterhouse steak for two - medium.  It came out perfectly prepared on a hot sizzling plate.  Also had a baked potato with all the fixin's and creamed spinach - which I don't even like but was really good.  

We were too stuffed for desert so just had some coffee and that was excellent too.  

I'm not sure why people are complaining about this place.  For a steakhouse it is excellent.  The management went out of their way to make sure everything was good.  Was it perfect? No, for example one of our dirty martInis came out \"not dirty\" but when we mentioned this to the manager, he came back in 2 minutes with a freshly made dirty martini.  

All in all, we were very impressed and will tell our friends about this wonderful new steakhouse in town."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Ben and Jacks and I thinks its a \"best kept secret\" here in Old Town Scottsdale.  Excellent win list and service was spectacular!  The portions and price point is much better than other local Steakhouses...all in all a great time!"}
{"text":"Since we have been to City hall and other Maestros steak houses this venue does not compare. We waited for over and hour to sit down after having reservations for 7:45. Even giving them slack for valentines day we still didn't have the best experience. I give the management credit for trying hard to rectify the situation but this is a place we will not be visiting again. Food B- ambiance C- organization D- customer server C-. For that price I will choose City Hall every time."}
{"text":"This should have been a showcase nite because it was restaurant week in Scottsdale.  They should have really oyt their best foot forward, showing their best of the best....but that was not the case.  Several of our friends ordered a drink.  The bartender was basically doing nothing....but it took almost 15 minutes just to get a drink delivered to the table.  Then we ordered....I opted to not have the restaurant week specials, but everyone else did.  I ordered a veal chop.  I'm a pretty darn good cook, by the way.  The veal chops I made last week that I purchased from Costco were superior quality than the  two chops that made up my order of veal chop.   My chops I made at home (plus de Veau) were delicious and charred and and I am drooling thinking how good they were!  Each chop at Ben and Jack's had a long tail at the end with bones on them.  Weirdest thing not to have cut this part off.  The meat was not aged well or it wasn't fresh.  Sorry.  It had a very strong taste.  They served it with what they called Jus, but it looked like pure grease.  No taste to it at all.  Our friends had the medallions that they shared a bite  with me.  I was less than impressed.  The chicken Parm was so paper thin, but it had lots of breading on it to make it look thicker.  The salads were fine, but the desserts were, I am positive, brought in from an outside purveyor and were commercial grade.  
Peter Luger trained????  I find that hard to believe.  Peter Luger's steaks are outrageously delicious.  If Peter Luger knew they fashioned this restaurant after Luger's, he would be turning over in his grave.  I fear this will be another restaurant that will bite the dust like so many other mediocre attempts to open a fine restaurant.
 It took us almost 2 hours to complete our dinner and this was a restaurant that was half full, or half empty however you want to say it.  The server when he delivered my sizzling chop had it wrapped in a towel and as he brought the plate to the table, he dragged the towel along my husband's Chicken Parm!!!  What a mess!  I could go on and on, but now it's almost comical!"}
{"text":"Tried this out for Restaurant Week and was very glad. Service was excellent as was the food. Had the 12 oz Sirloin and  the others tried the Salmon. Had the Canadian Bacon appetizer and it was good. We also had a half dozen Oysters which were not on the Restaurant week menu. Everything was perfect. Our waiter Jare was a real pleasure. We will be back for special occasions."}
{"text":"Very nice place, I have to say.  Made reservation through Open Table for Thanksgiving Day.  They offered a Prix Fix dinner however my husband & I could not take part since it was not Atkins friendly.  We started the meal with the bacon appetizer and the beefsteak tomato & mozzerella salad.  Both were amazing!!  The tomato & mozzerella salad comes drizzled with a parsley olive oil which was lovely. Not drowned in it - but just a little drizzle.  The bacon - well - I'll be dreaming of it later, just sayin.  Then our bone in, dry aged, rib eyes arrived in all their glory accompanied by a shared side of creamed spinach.  OK - don't be down on THIS creamed spinach cause it was cooked spinach & slightly blended with a little cream & buuuuuuutter.  Soooooo good.  Our steaks cooked perrrrfect.  We ended our meal with a beautiful delicious cappuccino.  Bellissimo!!!!!  Service was good. They usually have valet on the weekends but during the week you can park in the lot directly in front of the restaurant and they will validate.  The piano player was playing lovely music and the ambiance reminds me of an old school New York steakhouse.  I do have to say that when I make reservations via Open Table - I have notes in in the reservation stating we strictly follow an Atkins diet and not to serve bread to our table. I think we were offered bread probably 4 times.  TORTURE ME WHY DON\"T YOU!!!!  Most restaurants take the time to read their guest's reservations prior to their arrival as I have experienced in the past - and some don't.  The place had 4 tables with folks eating so it was NOT very busy.  Attention to details can make the difference.  The quality of the dry aged rib eyes was very good - not to be taken lightly.  Their cocktail menu was pretty tempting as well.  Definitely give this place a try - you can't be sad with a beautifully cooked steak as your meal."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Steaks are so large that splitting them is the only rational option.  German  potatoes came out burnt.  Why they thought it was ok to serve them was beyond me.  They replaced them with lumpy mashed which was an improvement but still nothing to charge $8 for.   

Bread options unremarkable.   

No cucumbers in the entire restaurant for my water, which, ok they've only been open 3 weeks but really?   

Service was good since we were only a handful of diners.  

Waiter didn't know how to describe one of the only two glasses of white wine available by the glass.   

No valet parking.   

Steaks were a highlight.  Great flavor, slight char.   

For these prices if they don't fix the portion sizes and improve the sides they won't be in business for long.  There are way too many other great Valley steakhouses in this price range."}
{"text":"Interesting to me that Ben & Jack's comments on the \"good\" reviews they recieve, yet do nothing, not even offer an apology for the \"less than perfect\" reviews"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this steakhouse. Swank atmosphere without coming off as cheesy. I started with a shrimp cocktail that was outstanding. Four shrimp, but the largest shrimp I've ever been served - easily way more meat than you'd normally get in a 6 pc cocktail. Then, I had the filet mignon which, at 14 oz, was plenty to satisfy my appetite. Cooked perfectly, it was very tender and aged well. The prices are a bit on the high side for the value, perhaps, but not outrageous given the Scottsdale location, ambiance, and what this steakhouse positions itself as. Plan to drop about $80-$100 per person to dine here, but you'll come away very happy. When I was unable to finish the steak, they had a very nice touch - offered to take my plate and wrap the leftovers for me. When I went to polish them off the next day, I noticed that they had scored the steak (without cutting it into slices) so that it would be easy to slice later while retaining the moisture and texture - nice job, Ben & Jack's! Withholding that 5th star only because all of the dinners are a la carte style (the steak does not come with any sides, such as a salad, veggies, or potato), but the 4 star rating does not indicate any dissatisfaction whatsoever with my experience here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Whoever panned them on the last review is either a phony or was there for dinner at 4:00 PM.  Maybe he's a fan of Seinfeld's parents.

From being met outside by the manager, Danny to the drop-dead gorgeous hostess, everything was perfect.  Our waiter, Patrick, who we have known for 17 years, knew exactly which wine to suggest and tailored our dinners to our exact tastes.  For those on a budget, they had the Restaurant Week menu available tonight along with a $49.95 menu that included just about everything.  

We got there at 6:45 and didn't leave until 10:30 and enjoyed every minute of it.  Definitely our favorite steak house in Scottsdale.  Food and service beyond reproach.  Great attention from the managers and all the staff combined with the kind of steaks I remember from Peter Luger's in Brooklyn.  

This is a don't miss restaurant in Scottsdale.

Take it from an ex-NY cop, it doesn't get any better than this.

{"text":"We stopped in here for happy hour a little over a week ago before heading out to dinner at EVO.  Typical steakhouse atmosphere, nice, big bar and a friendly bartender!  I tried the French Martini and was very happy with my choice...this bartender knows how to mix a cocktail.  They brought us house made chips to snack on while we enjoyed our drinks too - nice touch!"}
{"text":"We were very curious to try this place, as reviews seemed all over the place. I had the filet mignon. It was an average piece of meat. It was cooked nicely, but seemed very plain. The meal was served with generous portions of broccoli and mashed potatoes. Both of which were good, but none of the food seemed especially noteworthy. The wait staff was, for the most part, surprisingly attentive and friendly. However, one odd note, was that my friend was still eating his dessert- as in- food in fork in mouth, and the waiter asked him if he was done with it. He then left, and upon leaving, left our clearly finished, pushed out of the way- plates on the table. He then returned to ask again, less than a few minutes later- if my friend was finished with his dessert, when there was still ample amounts left on his plate, of which he was still clearly eating. He left a second time, leaving our same, finished, dirty dishes on the table. That being said, the staff was friendly and the food was good, but I prefer Meritage  or Ruth in both ambiance and food quality. Although, the Dean Martin and crooner music was nice in the background."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from north phoenix to try this place about a year ago so maybe things have changed but I've had better steaks from longhorn for $15 than the $40 plus one had here plus they didn't even cook the steak the way I asked. Like I said though been awhile so maybe things have changed."}
{"text":"I had huge and hopeful expectations having eaten at Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn, and other copycats (or whatever you want to call them)  in Manhattan as well. I dined on a Weekend night, and was pretty surprised to find the place so quiet. Part of the draw of a good steakhouse for me is a vibrant atmosphere. My server Antonio was very good - very friendly and not overbearing at all. Drinks were very good - I guess they should be for $14. The bacon appetizer left a LOT to be desired. I expected more than a thick slice of burnt bacon. I think that app should be reconsidered for pork belly. Caesar salad was small and nothing special about it. Steak for two (porterhouse) was pretty good, but hardly worth the money. The chocolate mousse cake was ok for dessert. Nothing really overly impressed me about this place. I'll continue to go to City Hall/Mastros when looking for a high-end steakhouse in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"one of the poor people who went there for Valentines......the hostess had a bad attitude, we had a reservation at 7:00, but were unable to be seated and order until 8:30.  After extreme hassles and delays, our waiter brought us our hors d'ouvres and salad at the same time...and it was only one salad bowl, which the waiter said we were supposed to split......even though our Prix fixe charge was $75 apiece.....we paid our bar tab and left, as did many other people......all in all, the entire dining experience was ruined for us as well as many others."}
{"text":"Sweet Pea and I went here for Restaurant Week because we hadn't been here yet, he loves steak, and they showed a pasta primavera vegetarian option.  We'd heard that this place was very expensive, so we figured $40 for 3 courses was a good way to try it.  As I read the Yelp reviews after we'd made reservations, I started to get seriously scared.  Everyone slammed the service- waits, walkouts, etc.  But Restaurant Week should be when a restaurant is MOST on its game, since it's an opportunity to introduce themselves to potential new customers, hopefully encouraging them to come back.  Plus, our reservation was early on a Sunday night.

We got there and were greeted immediately by a girl standing outside, one hostess standing inside, and a maitre d' or perhaps manager.  They immediately took us to our seat.  No service issues there.  The place was actually more crowded than I'd expected for that time and day, about 1/2 capacity, and was furnished in typical steakhouse style, pretty standard dark wood- nothing unusual.  The waiter and the busboy came right over, filled our waters, and offered us menus including the one for Restaurant Week, which showed no pasta primavera.  When the waiter came back to answer questions, I asked if they had any veg options, and he just shook his head at me.  I said \"it says you do online\" and he said \"well, I guess we could make you some pasta, with some marinara...\" and I said OK.  Look, I get that this is a STEAK PLACE, but occasionally you're a vegetarian who is married to a steak lover!  Maybe put one thing on the menu for me?  Or at least have something off menu that you know of and can prepare?  Durant's does this, Donovan's does this, etc.  We each got the mixed salad, and my husband got the 12 oz sirloin, and we got carrot cake and cheesecake for dessert.

The mixed salads, while only lettuce and tomatoes, were actually really good because of the tasty vinaigrette dressing.  The pasta was unremarkable, which I won't ding them for because it's a steak joint.  My husband's steak was just OK, served with nothing special mashed potatoes.  During dinner, I ran out of my glass of wine and would have had another, but the waiter didn't come back.  (A large party of 12 or so sat down, and he was assigned them as well.)  When he did come back, he didn't remember who had which dessert and set them at the wrong places.  Again, this is not anything huge- it's just that, if you're trying to be a fancy steakhouse with prices to match, these service items are what sets you apart from say, an Outback.  The desserts were OK- the carrot cake was better than the blah cheesecake, with a lot of spices.  After dinner we waited a very long time for the waiter to come back with our check- long enough to have the card out and waiting for him to prevent any further delays.

In sum, the experience was OK, but nothing to write home about or come back for.  If anything, it made Sweetpea discuss the merits of Donovan's the entire way home."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate our 5th anniversary, on a Monday.  Arrived at 6, and as expected for the area, the restaurant was empty (devoid of customers), maybe someone in the bar area.

Wait staff were very friendly, in the \"Look! New people!\" sort of way, and tried to be as helpful and friendly as could be.  Kinda a creepy vibe there, but they caught that, and toned it down a little.

Beware portion size!  The filet mignon is a 15oz. piece of beef.  That being said, my wife ordered it, and offered me a bite, and I thought it was perfect.  Tender, juicy, and delicious.

I ordered the Seafood Pasta dish, and everything came out nicely.  Half a small lobster, crab claw, scallions, and some of their fish (I can't remember what it was), white wine sauce with garlic.

Dessert was their crème brulé, which had a slight hint of orange.  Very tasty!

Overall, the place is a 4 star for me, only because of the ala carte menu style.  If they had some complete dishes, paired properly, it would have been much easier for us to decide.

Also, be aware that they don't tell you about the \"fixed price\" menu off the website."}
{"text":"Went there for restaurant week. Everything was bad..salad had more dressing than lettuce. Main course was bland. The mushrooms taste sauce tastes like it came from a can. Steak was charded on the outside and had no flavor Desert was tiny. Total meal was not worth 40 dollars maybe 20. They should hire people to bus the tables instead of making the wait staff do everything. Ooo and the water tastes like something out of the pool"}
{"text":"Everything is perfect about this place--the staff (awesome and friendly), the food is scrumptious and the manager (Danny) welcomes you all the time. But you must save room for dessert. I eat here about twice a week.  They even have a inexpensive  bar menu.  Justin, the bartender definitely knows all his drinks and various alcohols."}
{"text":"Once again a terrific lunch!  Went for birthday with four friends and everything was delicious.  Our waiter, Erik, went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of, bringing out an extra dessert, taking our pictures, asking what we needed but not being too pushy....excellent service.  As far as I am concerned this place is tops...in food, ambiance, and service!  Will return as always....keep it up!"}
{"text":"Mom's out of town for Thanksgiving so what do two grown men do???  They go out to eat!  This choice brought us to Ben & Jacks in Old Town.  I've eaten at Peter Luger's in New York but never one of Ben & Jacks spin-offs so I was excited to try it.  

The dinner started off at the bar for a cocktail.  Guinness on draft is always a good idea but in a 10oz glass doesn't quite seem right.  The Stoli and Tonic I ordered was great but again the glassware made for a short pour. When the check came, almost 22 dollars for the beer and cocktail.  I don't care how high-end you are, that's absurd pricing.   

Continuing on with our drink pricing fiasco we were moved from the bar to our table where we ordered a bottle of Panna for our flat water...Always a good choice when a restaurant serves it, but as we came to find when the check came, 10 dollars was the going price for that liter of water. Did I mention the word absurd?!?  I don't know if they are trying to recoup all of their start up fees in 2 weeks but at this pace they just might!   Moving on to the wine choice, it  seemed to be a little bit more reasonable as we saw a bottle of the Raymond Cabernet priced at 18 dollars a glass which would have ideally put the bottle at about 70 dollars, I say ideally because the wine list at the bar didn't have a price by the bottle for that wine ...I thought nothing of it but was definitely ready to try it and get some food in our tummies.... Things looked like they were looking up!


We then moved to the table promptly after drinks and were met by our server.  No specials given outside of the Thanksgiving Day Pre-Fix menu so we just ordered off the menu.  Dad started with the Oysters on the Half Shell ($13.95.  Great flavor and plenty of horseradish and cocktail sauce to season! I wasn't so luck with my Baked Clams($13.95).  These little neck clams were 6 to the plate and just that....LITTLE!  While the flavor was decent, the portion could definitely use an adjustment. I also found it a tad overwhelming that the server moved my clams from one plate to the other and then seasoned with the extra white wine reduction.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like being served like that. Sprinkle some pepper, grate some cheese but no touching the food...

Well now to dinner, and good thing I was still hungry after the appetizers because the Prime Ribeye($45.95) I ordered  was massive.  The bone-in rib eye was done perfectly medium with a Gorgonzola reduction I requested on the side.  Dad got the same with some sort of Au Jus... His ordered Medium Rare and again perfectly done.  As a side we shared the German Potatoes(13.95) Kind of pricey for a side but good overall flavor.  

After the meal absolutely no room to try a dessert so we asked for the check.  When it came I opened it and almost gave back all my food.  Not for pricing of the steaks but the pricing on the water and the wine.  The Raymond Cabernet came out at $90.  I don't know who is doing the math in the accounting office but  you're definitely in line for a raise! 

Long and the short of it...steaks were phenomenal, Antonio the server was great but everything else was mediocre at best.  Too many staff members running around and seemed like a lot of disorganization."}
{"text":"Made reservations for Valentine's dinner for two at Ben & Jacks  to finally try out this restaurant and to evaluate it to bring a group of 14 in March, and what a disappointment!
Our reservation was at 7 pm and we got there right on time, as we checked in the hostess told us they were running a little behind so we went to the bar and ordered drinks while waiting to be seated. (Went back to hostess and told her we will be waiting at the bar and to not forget us). A half hour later she comes in and asks us if we are going to eat at the bar and we respond \"no, we told you we will wait for a table\"  and with a bad attitude she tell us we need to wait a few more minutes.
At 7:45 I go back to check if our table is ready and she tells me we are next to be seated and the table is being set. The couple next to our table at the bar overhears me and tells me they had reservations at 6:15 and never got a table and they are leaving. Our bar server apologizes to the 4 of us for the bad service we are receiving.
We sit at our table and another 20 min goes by and nobody comes to take our order so I asked the bus boy if he knows who our waiter is and he points to a small black haired man that acknowledges us and yells from afar he will be serving us.
10 min later he comes and takes our order.  We order from the Valentine's set menu, calamari, cesar salad and porter house steak for 2.
20 min later he comes back with a huge platter of calamari and a small bowl of cesar salad (looked like the ones from the package at the supermarket).As he places the salad on my place setting I ask him what this is, and with an attitude he says \"that's your salad to share\", and that is when we finally said enough and asked the bar server (he apologizes again for bad service) for our bill at the bar and left.

This was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant bringing one dish at a time and with good service, not bad attitude, and we were not going to pay an expensive dinner for garbage.
As we were waiting for our car at the Valet parking line, the 2 couples waiting with us had terrible experiences also. One left without eating, like us, and the other couple said they had waited over 1hr 1/2 to ordered to be served mediocre food.

I know it was Valentine's, a busy day for any restaurant, but I have never had such a bad experience at any restaurant on Valentines.
The disorganization, stress level and bad attitude was as high as it could possible be, with the owner or manager apologizing to many people over and over (we could hear him).

THIS RESTAURANT NEEDS ROBERT IRVINE FROM RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME AND SAVE THEM!!!!

I will not recommend nor will go back  ever again, City Hall will get the group!"}
{"text":"Very nice meal. GREAT service. One of the better (not best - but still...) steaks I've had. Unusual in that they had a 16oz. filet. Cooked perfectly - which seems to be lost art these days - and the sides were excellent. The bacon mac & cheese is highly recommended. unfortunately one of our party took ill from dehydration and got VERY \"sick\". We had to call the EMT's. The staff was very professional and helpful through the whole ordeal. I'll bet dessert is excellent...but I might never know. A nice relatively hidden gem. I would go back again in a heartbeat. And don't take the 4 star rating lightly. I've only really given 2 places I've eaten a 5 star and/or equivalent: Antoine's in New Orleans and BOA in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner and had a wonderful time. Food and Service were outstanding. The management and staff really care and treat you like gold."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a great steak dinner and am not shy about paying for it.  We'll this wasn't one of them.

Arrived at 6:30 on a Wednesday night and there were three occupied  tables in the dining room.  Our waiter was very attentive but not very capable or confident. He explained the dry aging for their prime beef and how it was the best in Phoenix.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made made good recommendations,  he just wasn't very comfortable in his skin.  But he really tried hard.

There were four of us at the table and three ordered the large Porterhouse for two, medium rare.  I ordered the bone in rib eye, medium rare.  All the meat came out closer to medium and a little too charred for my taste.  Steaks are served on very hot plates so by the time you get through 1/4 of your steak, it's cooked up even more.

The appetizers and sides were good but nothing to write home about.  We had a moderately priced bottle of wine and a dessert, both good.  The tab with tip came to $360.  I don't mind spending that kind of cash for a steak dinner but I want to be wowed and I wasn't.  It was good but definitely not great.

The manager never once came over to visit with us, as he was too busy talking to the hostess and nursing a drink at the bar, watching TV.  When we left, he waved to us from his spot at the bar and thanked us for coming in.  

No wonder there were only three tables in the place."}
{"text":"At these price points I expected a Ruth's Chris or similar steak house. I had great service, but my steak just didn't seem to be at the quality it should be to justify the price. If you truly want a high end steak house then keep looking."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for restaurant week. The staff was wonderful and treated us like regulars (we sat in the bar) but the food was OK AT BEST! I won't pay to go there again just simply because of the food. The cheesecake was freezer burnt and the steak was mediocre. The crab cake was clearly not made in house and was not great. I think my expectations were a little high for this place considering the price of a plate and I might as well have gone to Longhorns (steaks at Longhorns are much better and cost much less). Anyways, like I said the people were great, but the food isn't..."}
{"text":"Had the Rib Eye Steak which a huge slab of beef but was ok tasting, after reading the history of Ben and Jacks and expecting something close to Peter Luger, I was expecting a lot but was not wowed considering the big prices. The portion of the Rib Eye was huge. Enjoyed the German Potatoes and the Prawns but the service could have been a bit faster considering there were no more than 5 other tables being occupied.

I  not much of a dessert person but we shared the key lime pie, chocolate mousse cake and apple strudel a la mode, all were very good.

I so wanted this to be the go to place for steak but I don't think I could say that now"}
