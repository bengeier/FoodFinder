{"text":"I've never been particularly keen on Bonnets chocolates they have a too manufactured taste but the cafe is actually very nice in a quaint sort of way.    They have s pretty standard cafe menu, light lunches and sandwiches etc and also do some specials which are very nice. It is a lovely place to go for a cup of coffee and a cake.    There is a lovely outside eating area which is very nice in the summer, it is at the back of the shop so offers privacy and is a nice place to sit and have a natter.    The cafe has a somewhat edwardian feel to it and is a beautiful looking building inside and out. It is a bit more expensive than other local cafes but does have a nice feel to it and is a bit more than a typical cafe."}
