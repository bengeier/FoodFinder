{"text":"I really wanted to try this place out. We came here on a Saturday for lunch. It was a little passed noon. The place was dark and the gate to get into the patio area to enter the restaurant had a padlock on it. I assumed the restaurant went out of business. Later on in the day, I looked on the internet to find out they are still open for business. I will have to try it again on a different day."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to eat close to the zoo, and found this gem on Yelp. It was delicious! My mother in law grew up in Peru and I have gotten to enjoy their cuisine many times over the years, this restaurant is my new favorite for Peruvian food. I had ceviche for dinner (spicy) and it was very flavorful.  My family tried several other dishes and all were great. We had to try their Pisco Sours which also were delicious."}
{"text":"Come here with a friend for dinner for the first time ever and LOVED it. The food is delicious and flavorful, all for a great price. The staff is friendly and provided excellent service.   Definitely a place to frequent!"}
{"text":"Good and full. Love this little place. We always go here with our family and usually call ahead so the food is ready by the time we arrive. Other than that on the times we've ordered in house it can take a little time but the food is sure fresh and worth the wait. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out. This place is amazing.  Authentic Peruvian food, cooked to perfection. I do not regret trying this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Just went to Mas with wife and kids who are all from Peru.  We can attest that this is authentic Peruvian cuisine. Everything was really fresh and tasty.  We had pollo a la brasa (roast chicken), ají de gallina (chicken in a spicy sauce), arroz con pollo (chicken and rice with cilantro).  The maracuya and chicha morada (passion fruit and purple corn juices) were super fresh and refreshing.  Service was super friendly and quick.  Great restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Have now gone twice.  Great food. This is a hidden gem.  Don't go if you are in a hurry!  Appetizers, main course options and desserts are all delicious."}
{"text":"Ceviche, Aji de Gallina, Lomo Saltado,  Pisci sour all delicious and authentic. Friendly service and updated decor make this a favorite for my family!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the ceviche! It was awesome and very fresh. Ive never posted but I really like this place. Cant wait to try the lomo saltaldo."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times the food was delicious and the service was excellent.  We also like that they have a dog friendly patio .  MAS Peruvian is now on our favorites list :-)"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant is a gem. Delicious food and artful presentation. We loved the ceviche, causa rellena, mussels, and rotisserie chicken. The service was kind and attentive. I can't wait to return and try more items here."}
{"text":"This is what my sister and i ordered and it took nearly 35 minutes to come out. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went here for my wife's birthday and the service was amazing. You can really tell the staff cares about the restaurant, and in making sure their customers are having a good time.  Had the ceviche mixto and it was so tasty -- just as good as we had in Lima.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing at MAS! Ruth is the best server ever! Food is fresh and great! I had the lomo saltado and it was so good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the ceviche. The fish used to prepare it was tilapia and it was cut in big pieces with no flavor at all. I am Peruvian and I have never tasted a ceviche like that, lacking of Peruvian flavor, very bland."}
{"text":"I was here visiting - fantastic Peruvian food and charismatic management! Get the Beef Heart Anitcuchos, and of course a pisco sour!"}
{"text":"I came here with my Peruvian husband and we were both very impressed! The food is AMAZING!  The decor is casual but quality, and the staff was really nice! We'll definitely come back here for more authentic Peruvian food!  Try the lucuma ice cream!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have been back to this restaurant since it has changed ownership and name. I would highly recommend that anyone who enjoys authentic Peruvian cuisine try out this restaurant. The flavors and dishes remind you of Peru and the prices and servings are very fair.  I ordered Seco de Carne (it arrived with salsa Criolla)  and my wife ordered Aji de gallina.  I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Love their roasted chicken. The rice and green sauce are just like eating in Cusco!  The staff is friendly and authentic"}
{"text":"Great food and quiet atmosphere. The owners are friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Good food and wonderful, attentive staff.  I had the ceviche and my wife had the slow roasted beef.  Both were delicious. She also had some purple fruit and corn beverage that was really good.  Our waitress was one of those waitresses that just happens appear immediately after you finished the thought, \"I really wished I had some...\"   Our waitress was great about suggesting food choices.  Once we selected something, she brought several different sauces/add-ins to enhance the flavor.  We had to travel from Portland to Phoenix to find great Peruvian food. It was so worth it.  Best meal of the trip!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch with friends and family! The service was excellent - thank you Ruth. I highly recommend the Jalea, lomo saltado, and anticuchos!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a real South American restaurant in PHX, finally found something other than tacos! Although I love our Friends to the South , Peru has quickly taken my heart.   If you like to dip your toes in before a swim, the Arroz con Pollo is your first stop. For the Insurrectionist who prefer to canon-ball, take a stab at Arroz con Mariscos! Neither will disappoint.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The service is warm and welcoming. I would recommend calling ahead and making a reservation.  We had 2 different ceviches as well as a chicken dish & everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Great new place with friendly hosts and wonderful customer service. I had the ají de gallina (chicken in spicy cheese/chile sauce) and a pisco sour - the national cocktail of Peru. Both were delicious and authentic. Peruvian cuisine is the next big thing, I'm convinced, so check it out!"}
{"text":"Second time here and I love it. Try the Mussels - maybe my favorite. I love the rotisserie too! Ruth is amazing and proud to tell you all about her Peruvian favorites and culture. I love that I get an opportunity to experience here in the Valley. Good food takes time and this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Great meal for all of us. I had ceviche pescado. Delicious!  Great flavor a bit of spice but not too much. Others had seafood and Saltado. All great!  Menu had a lot of variety and was easy to read with big pictures.  We recommend the Pisco Sour from the bar to round out the experience."}
{"text":"We loved everything about MAS Peruvian Restaurant. The manager, Ruth is adorable and friendly and made us feel right at home. The menu is amazing. We want to come back again and again so we can give everything a try. We had the 1/2 chicken and fries. The skin on the chicken was perfect and full of flavor, and the fries were exactly what fries should be, thick cut and crispy. We also ordered the platter of fish, clams, muscles, calamari, yucca and plantain that were deep fried, and  came with an excellent salsa of tomatoes and onions and a very yummy tarter sauce. Both were enormous portions, we LOVE leftovers, and the prices are very reasonable. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Más o Menos  Decided to check out Mas to their current Groupon promotion. This Peruvian restaurant was bought out   and rebranded recently. The menus were the same and I was told they were in the process of getting new ones. I decided to order the Carapulcra I had a chance to try the Seco de Carne. The Seco de Carne was edible but was very salty overall. The Carapulcra was underseasoned but was the best out of the two dishes. I was disappointed that they were out of rotisserie chicken and lamb for the night as the Arroz con Pollo is a classic dish.  I hope the best for this restaurant and that they fine-tune their menu and their flavors."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised to read that a second Peruvian restaurant had opened in tje greater Phoenix Metropolitan area.  For years there had been only one.  This restaurant is also on the small side, however it is clean and well lit.  I ordered two dishes that give me a good measure of how \"legit\" the place is: anticucbos de Corazon and Ceviche de pescado.  My only disappointment of the night happened next- they had no Peruvian beers.  Modelo Especial had to do as a stand in.  The Heart Anticuchos.came first.  The presentation was not elegant, but very utilitarian and unpretentious, much like you would find at a similar priced establishmemt in Lima.  Heart anticuchos are made out of sliced strips of heart muscle that is then skewered and marinated overnight, then grilled over charcoal.  The meat does not taste like liver- it tastes like lean beef.  This dish can quickly go bad, dry, and tough if overcooked.  These anticuchos did not disappoint.  One more thing, this is for those learning about Peruvian food: that green stuff IS NOT GUACAMOLE!  It is a hot sauce.  The cebiche de pescado did not disappoint either.  The dish is made up of cubed white fish with ñittle fat on it.  While still raw, \"leche de tigre\" (a mix of lime juice, salt, and other spices) is spread over the fish with some onions.  It can be difficult to not make the Leche de tigre too salty- which kills the dish like a stale tortilla kills a taco.  This one was dialed perfectly.  Next time I will try the other dishes offered in the menu- peruvian roast chicken and otjer dishes looked promising."}
{"text":"Peruvian food is easily one of my favorite cuisines. I've been to this place a few times when it used to be Villa Peru, which was overpriced and mediocre. I was hopeful that since they were under new management, they would step their game up and was eager to give it a shot. Nothing has changed. The menus are still the same menus from Villa Peru with all the same items still listed. The prices have not changed at all either. I kept it simple and ordered the Lomo Saltado and the meat was tough and overcooked, the onions and tomatoes cooked down and were soggy instead of crunchy.  Long story short, it is still basically Villa Peru but with a new name."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. She was very nice and charismatic. Food was different,  not Mexican. They have a good sea food and many spanish like dishes. I will come come back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I love bringing our family and friends here! The food is soooo delicious! Everything from the pisco sours, to the cancha, to the ceviche mixto, and the lomo saltado. Ruth was a sweetheart! She served us for the first time today.  You won't be disappointed if you give it a try! The flavors are awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't usually seek out Peruvian food, but when a coworker said she wanted to try this place out, I was along for the ride. We came on a Thursday night around 7 pm, and it was pretty empty (no idea why!). It's tucked in a strip mall and can be a little hard to find, but it's right on the corner of the center. Plenty of parking.   Service was kind and unassuming; she was very helpful and accommodating to us, even when one of us received the wrong entree and unknowingly make it halfway through the food without even realizing LOL.   I had the Chicken + Rice Soup, which was full of cilantro and had fantastic broth. The meat skewer appetizer was also great - super well-spiced and perfectly cooked.   The one thing about Peruvian food that continues to confuse me is how dishes are kind of randomly cobbled together - e.g. the kebab app with the meat skewer, half of a boiled potato, and a pile of cooked corn (those ginormous Peruvian corn kernels are amazing!). Tasty, but a dining experience I'm still getting used to. I was also loving the complimentary \"corn nuts\" on the table; lotsa corn, all of it delicious.   The prices are right, whether you're looking for a quick bite or plan on spending and hour or so for dinner. With friendly service, interesting grub, and a convenient location (check out the nearby Desert Botanical Garden if you're making a day of it), there's no reason not to pop in for a visit."}
{"text":"I been coming here for a few months and never been disappointed with the food or the service. This cozy restaurant has unique tasty food with a large menu selection from seafood, to beef and chicken. I recommend the Piqueo Del Mar, Arroz con Mariscos and the Pisco Sour for a cocktail. Also, they just added a bar!! :)"}
{"text":"If my Italian friend, which is obsessed only with Italian food liked this place, then anyone can like it! So for that alone this place scores high. This is a quaint spot with a nice menu. The portions are good. Service was good, and best of all, the food was good. I wish now only prices would be better. I think that's the big factor that can make a difference in me being back. The prices are much higher compared to many other similar places and if they only fixed that for sure they'd have more traffic, because by the looks of it, the few people around seemed to enjoy the food, as much as I did."}
{"text":"I had the lomo saltado de carne and omg it was so good. The steak was cooked perfectly in a wok, the onions and tomato complimented it perfect. The jasmine rice was so amazing, seriously some of best rice I've ever had.   This place is in a kinda half-empty shopping center, parking isn't an issue. It's also pretty small, so I'm assuming there are some nights it gets busy. It's a very straight-forward experience and the food is flavorful. The service was also very good!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really a 3.5* for me but it's hump day so let's go ahead and round up.   My dinner companion bought a Yelp deal $10 off $25 purchase. We shared the bistek dish, the passionfruit drink, side of white pinto beans and the alfajores (cookie sandwich).   The steak dish came with fried plantains, french fries, rice, fried egg and a toasted hotdog.  - steak was very thin - fried egg was just a fried egg, nothing special - plantains were tasty, sweet and not too mushy - rice, just white jasmine rice - french fries were thick and crispy - hot dog was toasted but I thought the placement was just awkward.  - white pinto beans were whole and very flavorful (my favorite out of all things I tasted here)  Drink - passion fruit drink was a bit too sweet but I love the aroma of passion fruit  Alfajores - we were going to order the roasted custard but they said they didn't have it that evening.  Our waitress was friendly but forgetful. We had to remind her a few times for the passion fruit drink and the pinto beans. We didn't get the pinto beans until we were almost done with our meal."}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place to anyone! Food was full of flavor, authentic, reasonably priced, with generous portions. We knew this because there was three different Peruvian families around us. We ordered muscles that were outstanding. The meal I ordered was full of different types of seafood.  Beyond the food, our server Ruth was so sweet and genuine. Wonderful experience, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The (1) grilled beef hearts (anticuchos) and (2) the grilled beef with eggs, platanos, white rice were well-seasoned, juicy, and large in portions.  They come with a spiced green chili sauce that really compliments the flavors in the meat.  Their dessert, a Peruvian traditional, is composed of two cake-textured layers with syrup in the middle gluing the two sides together, served on a plate of white powder sugar - it goes really well with tea or coffee.  Additionally, the servers Ruth (Peruvian) and Bea (Mexican) are really charming and fun to chat to when it is not busy.  Hi, Ruth!  I promised to write a review and here I am!  Highly recommend trying this place as a lunch break, as it is just a short drive from tourist sites such as the Zoo and the Botanical Garden"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we ordered two dishes. His wasn't as spicy as he wanted and my beef came out cold. Was a little disappointment because we got there at 3 pm and didn't get our food till 4 pm. The salad part of my dish was super yummy tho..i would come back for that. Also we sat down and our server said she would get us ice waters but completly forgot and then came back to ask us again what we wanted to drink. Maybe they are understaffed..I don't know."}
{"text":"Many of us are either obsessed with idea of visiting Machu Pichhu or have plans to visit that Peruvian icon. Well let's forget that and explore the cuisine at MAS.  This is the real McCoy if you are looking for authentic Peruvian fare.  I must admit that I and my dining companions were somewhat skeptical about this joint as it's located in a rather deserted strip center. I am glad we chose to eat there anyway.  The food is incredible. The service friendly and sincere.  My huge bowl of Peruvian soup was the bomb. My dining companions tasted it and were as awestruck as I was. I have to say the same about what they ordered.  Our server, a young lady, although somewhat challenged in communicating in English was a sweetheart: friendly and eager to help.  The only disappointment was that they were out of the appetizer featuring beef hearts. But there was a reason for that. The night before they had lost electric power and whatever the chef had marinated for the next day had to be discarded.  Well it was a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I went up in here. One day.  Man I gotta tell you, this food will make you eat! I had some heart meat and it was so healthy n tasty. Nutrients. Plus they have nice ambiance n stuff (if you're in to chillin out) If you're trying to taste something tasty, go now my friend. White fish ceviche and some corn nuts."}
{"text":"Lomo Saltado de Carne!! Aaaamazing! My fav Peruvian dish. I've also had it with chicken breast, which is also super good. Cute spot, love to support local businesses in the area. Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last week. As a native from Peru, I know how Peruvian food should look and taste. I had to returned every dish I ordered here after a bite or 2. I asked the waiter where the Cook was from and he said, he's Peruvian! He also said they were just starting but, with a Cook like that...I'm never going back. No stars for them, I was forced to at least mark one star here but, only did it so that people can see this and understand that Peruvian food is not served at this place."}
{"text":"While greeting the staff quickly explained that, the restaurant is going through changes in management. It is evident: the sign on the door no longer matches the name.  The menus are thick and each page has a big picture. There is not much to explain in words. The fare is simple but surprisingly good.  There are no table clothes, or carpet. There is an echo. The hostess and waitress are very attentive.  Anticuchos served on skewers comes with a roasted potato, large kernel white corn and a small dish of grated ingredients hot sauce. The taste of the marinade in the beef heart stands out. The meat is tender but firm. You must chew but it readily yields. The white corn is mellow tasting. Those that like it hot will be thrilled with the grated hot sauce. It is not the typical Hispanic tomato based hot sauce. It is distinctly rough tasting. : the perfect accompaniment.  Papa A La Huan is potatoes covered in Adreian cheese with yellow peppers very. It tasted like potato salad but the presentation was exquisite.  Cau Cau De Mariscos is a combination of seafood, potatoes in a light tomato sauce. It was mild flavored but the calamari was perfectly cooked.  Most dishes come with rice and/or French fries. There was nothing special about the fries. The rice is in the shape of a cone: very impressive.  It appears they have one menu, lunch and dinner. Everything is allocate'. Expect to spend at least $12 per person, if not twice that."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place, friendly staff and amazing seafood can't ask for more  p.s the Peruvian corn is great!"}
{"text":"Traveling through and found this little Peruvian gem. The food was truly amazing, took me back to the country of my birth. I ordered the anticuchos which were cooked to perfection and the Huancayina sauce that came with it was delicious. I had some homemade chicha morada with my meal and it was as good as it can be. For my main course I got the carapulcra which was fantastic. Not a dish you find in many a restaurant, even in Peru.  The chef did it perfectly. True comfort food. All delicious and the staff and management were wonderful to us. Can't wait to come back!  Provecho!"}
{"text":"Look no further for an authentic Peruvian dish. This place is amazing!! Fantastic flavors and great service! I have a Peruvian background and I can attest this place is 100% what you've been searching for. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. I will definitely will be bringing my family back and recommend It to everybody. We had a great time specially since we watched the soccer match and the place was packed and they still made space to service us. I'll be coming back soon and bringing everybody with me!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I was working for a few days in AZ and saw the reviews for this place and decided to stop by and check it out. Coming from LA I can say that the food was delicious and not only that the service provided by Octavio was great. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We came to Tempe to visit ASU.  We found a yelp deal for this restaurant and thought we should it out. We ordered anticuchos, ceviche, picante de mariscos, and chicken. The food was very good. The server was attentive and very nice.  Overall a good restaurant."}
{"text":"After driving for days across the country we ended up in Tempe at 8:00PM because there were really cheap hotels. Mas closes at 9:00PM but the owner, Ruth, was extremely glad to see us even though it was close to the end of the night.  This was our first experience with Peruvian food, and we shared just shared an appetizer and the beef heart skewers to have a light meal before bed.   First off, just get over the fact you're eating the heart of a cow and try new food. Second off, this place is god damn delicious. Let Ruth pick things for you if you don't know what to try. Let her make you some Peruvian cocktails. The prices are quite varied, so you can have a few dishes to share that are cheap, or go for some of the pricier dishes.  I've decided I really like Peruvian food based on this experience and my only regret is that I'm not able to try more of the menu at Mas. The dishes are very photogenic, the atmosphere is very inviting, and the food is extremely unique/flavorful.  Just off the high way if you're traveling from the east coast to the west coast and nearby several hotels. Our meal was about the same as it would have been if we stopped at some road side diner, or went to a sports pub, and the food quality was far superior."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the Scottsdale area and decided to stop here.   I'm a vegetarian and my Fiance is a meat eater.  This was the perfect compromise!  I had the \"Tacu tacu\" which is Peruvian beans, Rice and veggies.  The flavor was outstanding!  Our tastebuds were very happy.  As a couple of reviews mention...service is not as quick.  However, I could tell it was very authenic and worth the wait!  We were still in and out...within an hour.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! Amazing Peruvian cuisine, lots of variety, all so freshly made, low prices and a ton of value for money!  But beyond the nice food, Ruth the young Peruvian lady who runs the place is a sweetheart. Highly recommend this place.  Will be ordering for catering to my office starting from next week."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with trying Peruvian food and it did not disappoint. I was a little apprehensive about coming here at first but I'm so glad I did! I had the slow cooked beef dish with rice, Peruvian style fries and canary beans. Omg the beans were incredible! Everything was so good! Definitely coming back!   The wait time is slow though. Could improve on that. But the food is flavorful and delicious and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. I would recommend this place to everybody. Peruvian food is a lot better than most people know and this place hit is right on the nail."}
{"text":"We had visited this place back when it was Villa Peru. We had hopes that with the new name and ownership that things would have been better.  When we first pulled up the sign said that they were closed (it was during their website's open hours) but it looked like they were open. We called from the parking lot to check and no one bothered to answer the phone.  Right as we were going to leave we saw someone walk inside and flip the sign.  We were the first ones there and our food took forever.  In fact, the couple that came in after us had their meal and paid a good 10 minutes before we even received our appetizer.    The pictures all show that the antichucos come with 3 skewers and we only got 2 with 3 pieces of overseasoned and very overcooked beef hearts.  Then finally our main entree arrived! Or so we thought.....They brought us arroz con mariscos.  We had ordered a jalea.  The waiter apologized saying that the kitchen messed up.    Finally after an hour of sitting down (and being the first customers there) we were served the correct dish.  It was extremely disappointing. We've had jalea at numerous Peruvian restaurants and this was the worst we'd ever had!  The chef had literally just dumped the battered seafood in the fryer and then served it with the marinated red onions.  He didn't even bother to season it!!! There was absolutely no spices used or flavor.  I understand that different places make their dishes differently, but they even used Villa Peru's old menu that clearly showed a different style of jalea.   There was no excuse for the half-assed rush job on this dish with lack of flavor.  We were using a coupon, but they didn't even try to comp us part of the meal (such as the $3 can of Sprite).  Besides the waiter apologizing again, the only attempt they made to make up for our horrible experience was giving us one to-go-cookie for the 2 of us to split...."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place. They are very nice and have great music. They got me a good drink and the food was very good. It was a great experience and I will return again."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the poor mans steak and it had a lot included in it, little on the higher price side but the quality shows"}
{"text":"I would give it a five star for the food and service. The best Peruvian food we have had. Ruth is charming and provided excellent service. However it was very noisy, to the point where it made any conversation difficult. We were there in the early afternoon so only one other couple there. I know that they have to do a lot of work at that time to get ready for the evening, but they need to figure out how to block the noise. We will certainly be back, but might consider take out. Difficult since a lot of the food is fried such as the yucca. All in all, a great meal."}
{"text":"Not only was the food extremely flavorful but the service was just as excellent.  I met the owners and they were pleasant to speak to as well."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Great food, superb customer service, a bright, vibrant atmosphere, and a real feel-good vibe! Owner and staff are super-personable and very attentive. Our first visit tonight did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had the ceveche de pescado ... the best i have ever had. Highly recommend to try this out if you want authentic Peruvian!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with my boyfriend who is from Peru. We have been to the other peruvian restaurants around town but this one is by far the best!!! The papa a la huancaina is one of my favorite dishes as well as the ceviche and leche de tigre. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and helpful staff. I ordered anticuchos and I feel like I was in Lima. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food was probably 3 stars.. have had better Peruvian in the valley. The service was terrible. Our drinks were not refilled until the end.. I almost went next door to the gas station to buy us waters..and there were only a few other tables. Seemed odd overall. I could have given better service to the other tables and I don't work there. Was difficult to tell what the waitresses were doing. Everyone in there seemed annoyed. May try them again but with new Peruvian places popping up will probably avoid."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. Service was a bit slow but not sure if they were truly slow or if they were giving my date and I time to be alone. I will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"I'm not a negative person and do not like to leave negative review but this place was one of the top ten horrible eats from service to food. Very poor service, waited for my 30 minutes for my water and an hour and a half for my wrong food. I have to walk felt bad but want to let peknow that these people can't keep up with their business"}
{"text":"Very good, food is fresh and tasty. It's one of the best Peruvian restaurants I've been to outside of Peru."}
{"text":"Amazing Food thank you love it here will definitely come back and recommend to all my peeps thanks again!"}
