{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. A friend of mine said we should give it a try. He knows the \"city\" very well. Anyway, I decided to give the chicken and waffles a try. After a decent wait, our food finally made its way to our table. During this extended wait my glass of ice began to melt, begging to be refilled for more than 10 minutes. They were not busy at all mind you. Back to the food. The chicken and waffles came out in grand fashion. Served on a big platter with the chicken in a small bucket. The small bucket however is stuffed mostly with wax paper leaving only 3 of the smallest pieces of chicken I've ever seen. The chicken did \"look\" like it was going to hit the spot. However what I soon realized is I was tricked. They had served me extra crispy chicken bones. With virtually no meat to eat I was left very disappointed. The meat that was still attached to the bones was as dry as the Mojave Desert. I'd have been better off attempting the cinnamon challenge. I'd rather they use a frozen bag of Tyson chicken strips. The waffles also left a lot to be desired. Lacking flavor and substance, the waffles tasted like yesterday's microwaved leftovers. The only positive was the chipotle dipping sauce it was served  with. Thanks to this tasty sauce I was able to choke down this unappetizing menu item. I was prepared to tell my waitress that this was probably the worst meal I'd ever been served and a complete waste of $13, but she never asked how everything was. Please remove this from your menu and send this \"chicken\" and waffles to a pig farm for the swine to dine on because it surely isn't suited for human consumption.  Oh. I'm still waiting for a refill."}
{"text":"Went there 1-23-2016.  The pretzel and fried green tomatoes appetizers were tasty.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with hush puppies and dipping sauce, both delicious.  Only blemish was when they brought my whiskey sour to the table it had two dead fruit flies floating.  They must've got into the sour mix."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles! Shrimp and Grits! Smoked Mac & Cheese! Oysters! Catfish! Jambalaya! Smoked Pork! Brisket! Etc...Place is freaking amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken and waffles, to die for, unique and excellent mac & cheese.

Could use either Budweiser or Harp on draft."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday. Where do I begin?
The service was horrible.  Our server gave us water and we did not see her for 30 minutes. We finally asked another server to please find her so we could place our order.  Here she comes, out of the kitchen all smiley. So, we place our orders: jambalaya, brisket, the Morehouse sandwich. Off we go on another trek through the desert of waiting.  It took almost an hour to get our food.  At least this time she asked if we wanted more drinks while we were waiting. Is the long wait a ploy to get people to buy more drinks?
Now I'll cut to the food...bleh. My brisket sandwich stuck in my throat, it was so dry.  It had a teaspoon of slaw slapped on the top, no sauce no horseradish, nothing. to quote one of our party, the Morehouse sandwich should come with a side of antacids.  No one in our party finished their food. Will not be back, over two hours wasted."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Willoughby. Great food and a very fun late night crowd too. Love the atmosphere and the food!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere in the heart of downtown willoughby. The menu is very unique and satisfies everyone's tastes. 18 craft beers on draft and and very nice seasonal drink menu. Warm and inviting on the inside. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Come here often for drinks but was most recently here on a Wednesday night. Outside patio was open with only 2 tables taken. Service was very slow with both food and drinks. Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"Sadly, I was disappointed with my experience at the Morehouse. Service was slow and inattentive. The jambalaya was good as were the tacos. The fried half chicken was excessively salty and consisted of a wing, a thigh and 1/2 of a breast - that's not quite half a chicken in my book."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this weekend while we were in town for the Willoughby Last Stop Festival (super cute festival by the way.) We got there around 5:30 PM and were seated straight away. I ordered a moscow mule, the 1/2 fried chicken, smoked mac and cheese and corn bread. We were going to order the greens but they no longer serve them, even though they are still listed on the menu. My husband ordered a specialty burger with fried green tomato and french fries. 
The wait for food was so long, considering there was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it was a Saturday night, so they should have been staffed up. The fried chicken, while generous in portion size was un-generous in flavor. The breaded was not seasoned, the chicken was over cooked and not seasoned. The mac and cheese was too saucy. The fries were amazing, but I can get good fries anywhere, and my husband said his hamburger was very good. So if YOU check out this restaurant, avoid the chicken and go for the burgers."}
{"text":"Great food. 
Opening night.  We split the chop salad- spicy and delicious. It was excellent with crisp lettuce and smooth avacado. 
The jambalaya was very good.  Not too spicy- more would be ok with good amounts of andoule sausage, chicken and shrimp.
The mole short rib was incredible. It was tender and flavorful with a touch of spice.
The portions were just right.
Our waitress, Martina,  is a gem. She made sure we had full drinks and that everything was right. 

Come here; you will enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"You would think with so many bars in downtown Willoughby, it'd be an easy thing to find a place with the same age group & demographic, but that all changed the night I walked in, saddled up to the bar and quickly saw some 50 plus year old woman hitting on the male bar tender to show her his abs over a couple of jello shots, which he obliged her to do...

...which probably helped to explain the so-so service I got for the rest of the night. I won't deny the places popularity. I got there early enough in the evening to see it fill up in about an hour, but I didn't get there early enough to be outright ignored for the first 10 minutes with 2 bartenders and one server, who I might add, was the only one who noticed I didn't have a drink in my hand.

I tried a sammich, and it wasn't much to write home about, and the beer offerings weren't bad, with a heavy prejudice towards this new trend in India Piss Ales that all the hipsters lap up to set them apart from people who actually know something about good beer.

End of the day, it's a bar. Not much to set it apart from any of the other places on the strip, other than it's newer place.

Go there, get a beer, let the vibe sink in, and this might be the place for you.

I know this review may come off a negative, but the truth is, there just wasn't anything about the place that stood out to me."}
{"text":"Ok, I tried a different Coyne bros restaurant since everyone raves about these places. Honestly I don't get why. The food was pretty good, but again, the atmosphere was not, attitudes of staff, their selective attention to certain guests. I think these boys should have stuck to bars & bar food."}
{"text":"11-21-17: First time eating here was today. Always heard good comments about the food...I have to say the food was INCREDIBLE! The service AMAZING! The atmosphere soooo comfortable. Had this to eat: THE MOREHOUSE - 
chorizo patty+potato hash+poblano queso + sunnyside egg+green tomato+bacon aioli. Paradise on a plate. Side of smoked mac n cheese (best mac I ever had) 5 star recommendation"}
{"text":"After going to the Wild Goose and talking to the owners, was told they were opening this place.  Went there when it opened and was not impressed.  I thought it was billed as a smoke house/BBQ restaurant, but it doesn't come across as that.  I got the pulled pork and asked about what varieties of sauces they had and was told they only had one.  Really???  The pulled pork was not very smokey.  The Bloody Mary Bar was not really set up right.  We are not planning on going back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here because I had an Uber eats coupon. I got the sampler platter and a side of smoked Mac n cheese. I had noooo idea how much food this was. This was an epic feast. Make no mistake about it. The sampler comes with chicken, sausage, ribs , brisket , and pork. A giant box of sauces, coleslaw and pickled things. The Mac n cheese.... omg... the Mac n cheese.... better than s*x..... it will haunt your dreams. I'm telling you.  The meats, coleslaw and sauces were all great too. Definitely a lot for the money and everything was amazing. Got an epic feast delivered for around 30 bucks. Can't beat it !"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had!!!.. moist , tender and sooooo good!! Chicken and waffles!!!!..AMAZING"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a double date and we requested to try this restaurant because of the food they had at United We Brunch. We came here on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was busy but not packed and we got a table right away in the bar area. We were forewarned by our friends that the food is really good but for some reason the service is the slowest in town...unfortunately, they were correct. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating but we couldn't figure out what was taking the kitchen so long!

The food really is delicious here and I would really like to give this place a better rating but they really have to work on their service times. I ordered The Morehouse: chorizo patty, potato hash, poblano queso, sunnyside up egg, green tomato & bacon aioli. You can choose between ordering fries or hush puppies- I of course got the hush puppies. My food was fantastic. The egg was perfectly cooked and I ate the whole thing- enjoying every bite. 

My boyfriend ordered the Buttermilk Fried Half Chicken Dinner and our friends ordered the Burger special of the day and the Chicken and Waffles. Here is where it gets interesting. My boyfriend got skimped on the chicken they gave him. He got tiny pieces of chicken (even though it was supposed to be half a chicken) while our friend who got the Chicken and Waffles and two HUGE pieces of chicken! We really felt like the kitchen was trying to give him leftover pieces (see picture for comparison of his small piece to our friends dinner). The waitress was very apologetic but come on the you are serving chicken to 2 diners at the same table! We are going to notice. It made us wonder how many other people got skimped on their order. The waitress did put in a new order for us but again the wait time for it to come out was long. Once the new chicken arrived the pieces were huge! The question of the night was...why would you even serve the first one?! 

Even after the whole debacle the chicken was really tasty. Everyone agreed that their food tasted great and our friends have said they haven't had a bad thing on the menu but they always know that they will wait an extended period  every time for their food."}
{"text":"Great spot, great beer, great people. I adore this place! Food is a 10, always great specials, ($3 drafts on wednesdays) and amazing management!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!! We had a group of 4 and every thing we ordered was great. I had the mac and cheese and it was the best I have ever had. We also got the prime rib, beer can chicken and salmon it was all very good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Three of us just waited on their patio for over 20 minutes and didn't even get greeted.  The server walked by us about 30 times and didn't even make eye contact with us.  Poor choice"}
{"text":"Stopped in last Saturday with the lady, 8:30 or so. Original plan was to finally get to Hook & Hoof, but the wait there was over an hour. Morehouse, on the other hand, was empty. Here's why...

We were not greeted for a couple minutes upon entering. Reason being is that the hostess was doubling as the sole waitress. Call offs happen, I hope. Appetizers were deviled eggs and calamari, both quite delicious and came out quickly. Entree for me was pick two BBQ, brisket and ribs. Brisket portion was small, but the more troubling fact was that only half of the small portion was edible. The other half was a series of burnt, dry strands. Now the bad.... the ribs. Skimpy, over charred to a strange crust I will never even understand and worst of all, an overwhelming taste of lighter fluid. Pure lighter fluid. Absolutely intolerable to eat. When I politely brought this point to the attention of the hostess/waitress/onlypersonaround, the response was a *shrug* \"thats weird.\" Yes miss, weird indeed. In this situation I am not expecting the entire meal to be comped, but at least a glimmer of empathy to justify the 20% you are going to receive on $70 worth of indigestible poison. 

Made it to Hook after for cocktails, they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Get the beef brisket it was the best I've had! We really enjoyed the catfish sliders as well. Mac and cheese was also good but we just got a side to try it- it was very rich/cheesy so I'm not sure I could've handled the full order of it but nonetheless delicious. Service was very attentive and took time to have conversation with us. Decor is neat you have to check this place out even if it's for drinks  !"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great surprise. The food is incredible. Braised short ribs melt In your mouth and the beer can chicken is moist and flavorful. The smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese is wonderful. This might be my new favorite restaurant in DTW. Stop in and give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Ate here during art fest. I expected a long wait for food, but did not expect the restaurant to not be prepared for the rush. They created a minimized menu, but we waited over an hour and got no food at all. You'd think that they'd be cranking out the smaller menu of food and, at the very least, be providing something small for people to eat. Have they ever had time periods of being extremely busy? It's insane and unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse of southern cuisine. The fried chicken was burned and the portions are not worth the price. I would never go back there. A menu change should be in their near future. I get what they were trying to do but they need to try harder or fire the chef."}
{"text":"Wednesday is $3 craft brew night. The bartender let us sample a before we bought.We were a large crowd of 14. They had already set up our table when we arrived. The wait staff was attentive. Everyone liked the food. The barbecue was the highlight. The chicken and waffles was a generous  portion and very tasty. I enjoyed my shrimp Po boy and coleslaw. The only drawback was the food cameout in spurts. Not everyone was served at the same time. December is a great time to go to downtown Willoughby with all the lights."}
{"text":"I went on a week night with a 50 gift card. This place is nice and cozy inside not too packed for s Monday but the service was really good. Apps were half off so we got the queso dip, it was really good. I got the brisket dinner w Cajun slaw and baked Mac n cheese. It was so good. My gf got the brisket sandwich. Both were delicious. After all that I had 17.00 left on the card I'll def go there again. I recommend this place for sure. Tuesday is taco special night. I highly recommend the Mac n cheese taco w onion straws and siracha."}
{"text":"Well we made our way through DTW so stopped here to see what it was about. Got a great bar staff and able to just create a drink u want off the wall. We just ate some pickle dip down the road but decided hey lets try an app! So after a very torn decision between fried green tomatoes or the trio dip, we went with the trio dip and all i can say is wow salmon guac off the chart could use a little more salmon but very good, the chicken queso a bit over the top on spicy hot but good, the onion dip is the key to this trio, amazing creation with that one!  The only thing i would change with this one is a little bigger portions then 3-4 oz jars and maybe two types of things to put the dip on besides colored corn chips, maybe pita chips or a nice warm fresh dough ball.  We can not wait to come try out the entree menu to really see what this place can do."}
{"text":"Great dinner at Morehouse Brewery!  Fun bar/restaurant atmosphere with lots of TVs to watch sports. I had the smoked Mac and Cheese and my husband had fried chicken. Both were very tasty!  The portions were as expected and the prices were reasonable. Very nice hostess and wait staff. There are plenty of options in Downtown Willoughby but Morehouse Brewery is certainly worth a try!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is most known for their BBQ, I decided to go with the Morehouse Burger which was made with chorizo and a sunny side up egg dropped on top. The egg was cooked perfectly and the chorizo had great flavor. Served with hush puppies twice the size of a golf ball. Would definitely recommend. Would have given a 5 star but the atmosphere was a little too raucous for my liking. But great place. Decent beer selection too."}
{"text":"Don't let the saloon atmosphere fool you. There is some pretty good food being prepared here at Morehouse. Basically, it has a \"southern\" bend and most of the things we've tried are linked to this area, but after a few visits we're convinced that everything must be good. 

We've tried the Jambalaya, Beer Can Chicken, Chicken and Waffles (not really the classic version, but good) and the BBQ. Everything has been very good and exceptionally well priced.

The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Occasionally the garage door front window is opened so the entire place is al fresco. Pretty cool for a downtown Willoughby location. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Our noses literally lead us to the Morehouse. We were in the area, just passing by, smelled BBQ and stopped in for a bite to eat. It was quite unexpectedly the best barbecue we've had in a long time! The bartenders were great,"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in DTW. Sauces are great, brisket is the best choice of meats.

Great beer selection, always rotating local and regional brews to try."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times but only to drink. Today was the first time I went there for lunch and I was not disappointed. Well I was a little disappointed at first when I saw the menu but more on that later.

I think we were the first people in there because the place was empty but the employees were super busy cleaning the place like they were getting ready for an inspection or something. Turns out they're just hard workers.

We sat on the patio and it was a beautiful 72 degrees sunny day which we don't see much of here in Cleveland. The menu came out and it was small but that's a good thing. Sometimes too many food items don't let it kitchen concentrate on what it does best. I was interested in having a chicken sandwich but they did not have any chicken sandwiches on the menu. They had a couple tasty burgers a fried green tomato sandwich which my co-workers got so I asked the server if they had any chicken sandwiches. The server said well no we don't but we can make you one. How would you like a barbecue chicken sandwich? Excellent I said. 12 minutes later out came the most delicious concoction I've had for lunch in a long time. It was a pulled bbq chicken sandwich in a nice Tangy barbecue sauce on a bun with lettuce tomato and red onion complemented by a nice portion of fries. Each bite was better than the last and I cannot believe this isn't on their menu. Or is it? I think I've found the secret menu at Morehouse....."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Boyfriend and I shared the Mexican street corn to start. Then we shared the macaroni and cheese entree (so good!) and the pit burger with hush puppies. Service was prompt, and food wasn't crazy expensive. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere. I got the Morehouse chorzio burger and smoked mac and cheese - both of which I would recommend. The place wasn't too loud or crowded so that was refreshing. They had a good selection of beers on draft. My biggest complaint is that parking is bad. There is no where near enough street parking so we ended up a few blocks down the road."}
{"text":"Brunch was a little rough. Was not crowded at all, took forever to get our drinks, which I can look past. Then our food came, forgot to place my order, and then had another hiccups with the food quality. Don't know if I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Great food. A little pricey but it's good quality. I had a delicious salad and their bbq looks great. I would love to go for their taco specials. Staff was really nice. Good beer and cocktail selection. There is street parking but it fills up fast."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some jambalaya and wanted to check this restaurant out. It definitely did not disappoint. We went on a Friday night and it was fairly crowded with one server on our side of the restaurant. He took his time out of his busy schedule to let us know the specials of the night and went out of his way to provide everyone with great service. I'm impressed by the food and the service that was provided and I will definitely return back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Morehouse 3 or 4 times now. The food never disappoints! I'd highly recommend the pulled pork nachos - pork was so tender and the portion size was large, I enjoyed these so much I was full off them before my meal arrived. I've never had complaints about service other than the most recent time I visited. Service was friendly but slow.. our entree order wasn't taken until after we finished our appetizer, however it was a busy Saturday. Atmosphere on table side is nice, the decor is very rustic and the large open window is perfect for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with our dining experience here.  The food was fantastic.
Apps:
Oysters on the half shell 
Sweet potato deviled eggs
Entrees :
Beer can chicken 
Jambalya 
 Corn bread is awesome 
Mac n cheese was fantastic 
Slaw is very good"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is semi romantic although honestly too dim for my taste. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Our chicken was dry and service was pretty slow and inattentive despite it being pretty empty there. We may return at some point to give it another shot but it'll definitely be a while."}
{"text":"When we came the staff was busy, but the food was alright. Not great, but it had a decent taste. Try it out, I think the pizza at their other store is phenomenal so I was a little disappointed by this place"}
{"text":"Heavy on the meat here.  Two menu items were vegetarian and they were apps. Husband enjoyed his food.  Service was great.  I had a fry. It was good. Hope it wasn't cooked in duck fat."}
{"text":"Very good bbq spot. We went for an early dinner on a Monday so it was pretty quiet. We had the nachos for an appetizer but it could have easily been a meal for two. The mac n cheese we had for a side was super creamy and rich. I liked the brisket and bbq pork (did the bbq for 2) but it was a little closer to lukewarm when we got it. The server was vwry welcoming and happy to make recommendations. Loved the industrial vibe of the place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  We walked out of the place across the street because the bartender ignored us and took a chance on the Morehouse.  The beer selection was very good and the food was out of this world!   To top it off McPat the bartender was great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite game day spot! They have happy hour all day on Sunday, drinks and food both, including draft beer for under $2. The food is great and we've had awesome service every time. The menu offers BBQ selections as well as brunch. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was actually a bucket of fried chicken with the best waffles I've ever had! The burger, fries and wings are all awesome too. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 including 2 kids age 5 and 8. They did not offer a kids menu nor did they have kids cups. I had the Buttermilk fried chicken dinner with 2 sides- Mac n cheese and greens. The chicken was good but the breading was a little salty, the mac n cheese was excellent, the greens were lacking flavor. 2 people in our party had the brisket which they said was excellent, served with a very large side of thin sliced regular and sweet potato fries, which were very good. Service was ok. There was an error on the bill which  was corrected. I felt their prices were reasonable for what we got."}
{"text":"We came to eat dinner and I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was bloody. After waiting about 10 minutes I got my food but by then my friend was done eating her dinner. Never will come here again. Soooo disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd or 4th time visiting. We've had brunch before and it was good. Not awesome, but good.  There are not a lot of choices in DTW on Sunday night.  It was pretty slow. The server was attentive. The deviled eggs were good. For dinner, the server recommended the BBQ. We chose wings - maybe we should have taken the recommendation. They serve the whole wing which I like but these were baked, maybe?  Not crispy and very fatty. They seemed cooked to done but cold and flavorless. I got the hot sauce and my meal mate got their take on garlic Parmesan. We both then ordered a side of sauce. I didn't try the garlic Parmesan but my mate didn't like it any better and the hot I had I would easily nominate as one of the worse I've had. Pepper flakes were abundant but the rest of the sauce had a vinegar and tobacco taste - not flavor, there was no flavor. I've eaten a lot of wings and I am hard to displease.  These were not to my liking.  Next time, we'll stick to brunch."}
{"text":"McPat is awesome and the deviled eggs and Waffles and Ice Cream were amazing!!   I love supporting everything the Coyne's family and friends develop!   This place is so different from The John's Cafe I have been going to for over 10 years .... Check it out when in DTW!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined here 3 times now, and I am sure I will return again. I have no pictures, however, because this place is DARK in the evening. It's fine for eating, and I could still read the menu... it's just not the best for food photography. 

My first time here was late summer/early fall and I sat at one of the high tops in the part of the restaurant opposite the bar. The window/garage-style door was open, which was really nice. My husband and I shared the fried green tomatoes (bistro sauce, cotija cheese, maple balsamic greens) and the buttermilk fried half chicken dinner, which comes with two sides (I had mac & cheese and the seasonal veg (which was brussels sprouts with bacon). My husband had the \"The Moorhouse\" (chorizo patty, potato hash, poblano queso, sunnyside egg, green tomato, bacon aioli), which comes with fries. 

The fried green tomatoes were served side-by-side (vs. in a stack). The bistro sauce was a nice compliment (it kind of reminded me of the blooming onion sauce served at the Outback), the cheese was appropriately portioned (i.e. the tomatoes weren't smothered or short-changed), and balsamic greens made the dish lighter and tangy. We devoured everything..

I don't eat fried chicken often, but I remember being really impressed with my meal. The portion size was large, the chicken was juicy, the breading was in appropriate proportion to the chicken (i.e. I didn't feel like I was served batter for dinner). The mac & cheese was outstanding. It was gooey, cheesy, and just a little smoky. It was not dry or lacking flavor. I am disappointed the brussels sprouts aren't permanently on the menu. The portions for sides were fairly large, and I liked the presentation in little crocks. 

I remember my husband finished his entire burger, but I do not remember him raving about it. I do, however, remember him picking off my plate quite often! The fries are the perfect fries for smothering in malt vinegar (we didn't have any of the shoestring or sweet potato variety mentioned in other reviews). The fries weren't overly crispy or crunchy, still tasted of potato, and weren't stripped of their skins. To me, this is a borderline perfect french fry. 

For our first visit, I do not recall any issues with service. We were excited to return. 

A couple of months later we returned. And sat at one of the high tops on the bar side of the restaurant. It was a Sunday, and we were not aware they had a limited weekend menu. Even after going home and looking at the website, this was not clear to us. So WARNING: unless something has changed, IF YOU VISIT ON A SUNDAY YOU WILL BE ORDERING OFF A LIMITED WEEKEND MENU (NOT THE NORMAL DINNER MENU)!

I ended up ordering the gulf shrimp po'boy (fried gulf shrimp, lettuce, heirloom tomato, bistro sauce) with fries. I wasn't as impressed with this sandwich as I was with my previous meal. Between the breading on the shrimp and the bun it was just too much. The bun was kind of dry, and although the bistro sauce is tasty - IMO it's too strong of a flavor to be the only \"sauce\" for this dish. To me, this sandwich just seemed like it was missing something. Maybe the bun needs buttered and grilled. I don't know. It just needs something. The fries, however, were consistent with our last visit. They're quickly climbing my ranks as some of the best fries in Cleveland. I don't even remember what my husband ordered on this visit, which says something. It was obviously not memorable. 

On this visit I had ordered a beer off their craft menu. They have a very nice selection, and includes the IBU, %, and serving size. I ordered a pint (of what, I do not remember). My beer came out in this TINY glass that I would consider a \"sample\". I questioned our server about the size, and she launched into a diatribe on how some craft beers are served in smaller portions because of yadda yadda yadda...\". She was talking to me like I was a child. I then asked for the beer list back, showed her what I ordered, and informed her \"this isn't one of them - this one is a pint\". She then quickly apologized. Instead of bringing me a new glass, she said she'd \"refill\" my baby cup throughout our meal. I thought this was a little odd, but my tiny beer was always cold - and she was true to her promise keeping an eye on my glass and \"refilling\" it when it would near empty.

Finally, my husband and I visited again last night (on a Thursday night). I ordered the fried green tomatoes with a side of fries. Did not disappoint and was consistent with our first trip. My husband ordered the buttermilk half chicken dinner with mac & cheese and slaw. We shared everything. Between the two of us, this was more than enough food, and we still came home with a little leftover. We ate at a high-top table on the bar side of the restaurant again. We had absolutely no issues with our service. 

Overall, this is a nice addition to the Willoughby area. I'm sure we'll return again."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome. Have tried The Morehouse sandwich, hush puppies, the Sloppy Jose (brunch), shrimp po boy and the grilled romaine salad. Nothing has disappointed so far. Lots more on the menu I cant wait to try. Ive been there for brunch, dinner and take out and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Amazing service ! Mac and cheese was to die for ! Beer can chicken fell right off the bone ! You can tell everything is homemade ! Kristin was very attentive and pleasant! Will totally bring my friends here for dinner !"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Their BBQ sauces are great, we have tried the house BBQ, Carolina BBQ and house spicy. Their wings are great and if you come in on a Thursday it's $0.50 wing night!! You just have to order 6 or more. Tonight we wanted to try the beer can chicken but they were out. Our waitress recommended the quarter chicken as a good substitute. We already knew we LOVE their brisket but we wanted to try something new as well. The brisket today was better than the other times I've been here. Although they were all good, today the brisket was cut thicker and the portion a little bigger! If they can keep the brisket portion like this all the time I will visit more often!  Their greens are great! I usually don't like most greens because they still have a overpowering bitter taste. Theirs does not and tasted wonderful. And other personal favorite is their Brussels sprouts. They always have this as a side and it has bacon and is tossed in balsamic and olive oil. YUM!"}
{"text":"Not bad jambalaya had the right amount of kick atmosphere kind of neat thou a bit on the loud side thou . Will check it out again"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was horrible. The burger was a dry sliver of beef smothered in too sweet BBQ sauce. They forgot the onions and the bun was super stale. French fries were good, just not very many of them. Won't be back - there are too many good places with both good food and service."}
{"text":"Cool place and the fried chicken is the best I have had in the area! I also loved the Mac &cheese!"}
{"text":"I came into town just in time for the Rib Feast and there is some really quality establishments that show cased there. I didn't try The Morehouse, but the reviews were decent so I stopped in a couple days later. My initial thought was to order the ribs, but the waitress/bartender recommend the sampler platter and it was quite disappointing. The BBQ didn't seem fresh and lacked a smoky flavor all together,  you could  tell by the dry texture and the harder areas that it set on the bottom of the aluminum trays for long periods of time. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed their establishment and the wait staff was very friendly,  but the bbq was just sub-par at best. Their version of Carolina BBQ sauce was more like honey mustard and had no trace of vinegar, which you'd expect from a true Carolina sauce. They offered some decent draft beer options, but they could use chilled pints for that additional pop. I ordered some oysters that were decent, but the sauces that accompanied them were bland and tasteless. A little lemon and siracha is really all you need. I've never had oysters served with salsa Verde before and hopefully never again. They do have specials daily and Tuesday was $2 tacos and Caronas, which I may be back for sometime, but please get some true Mexican hot sauce and leave the Tabasco of breakfast meals only."}
{"text":"The dill eggs was excellent. The hush puppies is dense and not fluffy. Not very tasty. I ordered the St. Louis ribs specialand didn't like it at all. Instead of meaty St. Louis, I got baby back ribs. It was very dry and taste like pork jerky. Bbq sauce.is nothing spectacular. The coleslaw is not traditional dressing. Taste like the.same.dip for the.hush puppies. Not good how it was plated. Show have a wider plate. The ribs was placed.on top of the slaw and by time get to the slaw, it was warm. The.best thing on the dish was the smashed potato. I guess the special pf the night is.let's get rid of the ribs special. The shrimp and grits is good. Nothing to wow to want to eat again. More pub feel. Perhaps I will try some chicken and waffle next time. Great beer selections. Ok place."}
{"text":"Awesome owners. Awesome drinks.  Speedy service.  Deviled eggs are AMAZING!  Never a complaint here.  One of my favorite places to be."}
{"text":"Great Fried Chicken and the Smoked Mac & Cheese should not be missed. We liked the spicy mustard so much we conveniences them to sell us a pint!  We are with the big garage door open, which only added to the experience.

Our server Adam, was friendly, and good at his job(s)!"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate with a friend and loved it. It wasn't loud or crowded but it was a Wednesday night to be fair. There mac n cheese was out of this world and they had good drinks on draft and drink specials. $3 pints on Wednesdays. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"A fun place with southern industrial feel to it. Lots of metal and brick, but in a very appealing way. The menu is loaded with things I wanted to try, but in the end I settled on the Bahn Mi Sandwich, and I wasn't disappointed. The pickled vegetables were tender but maintained their crunch. The cilantro didn't overwhelm their pork, which was moist and delicious. And the jalepeños added just the right amount of heat.

To deal with that spice, I got to call in some help from their excellent beer list. I had some really good brews I hadn't tried before, and they were all priced the same, which made it a little easier to chose. Lots of times places that have a large number of craft beers price them  all over the map, which just bring unneeded mental gymnastics into then process of picking something.

The other folks in my party got fried chicken (a tad well-done but excellent nonetheless), brisket, a burger, and a chop salad. Our only critique is that the smoke flavor of BBQ doesn't *have* to make its way into as many dishes on the menu as it is.

Other than that, the service was great, and the live music was the perfect volume in the dining area. 

Overall, I recommend it highly and look forward to the chance to go back and a few more items!"}
{"text":"We arrived Friday, Jan 15th at 6:00pm with a party of five. Birthday celebration. I had called ahead to find that they do NOT take reservations on the weekend but do Mon thru Thurs. I was told by the staff that it picks up around 7p-ish so we got there before that. That was a good call. It did pick up.Seating is very limited. Our server was prompt and friendly and we began with drinks and appetizers. Blackened Catfish Sliders and Roasted Chicken Queso dip.
They arrived in a timely fashion. The Catfish sliders came with two so we cut them into portions for all to taste. The consensus was they were really good. Next time I will place two orders of them. The Chicken Queso was wonderful. All dove right in. My entree' was the Chargrilled Salmon with a side of Hushpuppies. My wife had the Jambalaya. 
        Chargrilled Salmon; I was extremely pleased with my meal. The salmon was a good portion and the bed of sweet potato puree was awesome. Hushpuppies? Well, they're hushpuppies. It's an indulgence I rarely pass on if I see them on the menu. They were good, a bit smaller than I'm used too but they gave you 5 or 6 of them and the sauce rocked! 
        Jambalaya: My wife really liked the Jambalaya. My small taste of it was pleasing, but being a bigger guy, my guess is I would have left a bit unsatisfied. As for my slender wife, the portion was fine with her.
        Overall, our first experience was a good one. Staff was kind and prompt. Selection of craft beers is great. Drinks were not watered down and prices are moderate. If you're wondering why I didn't go 5 stars, it would only be because four of us were served our entrees and the last entree came out 8-10 minutes later. Doesn't sound like much, but when you want to dive into the food sitting in front of you but you don't want to be rude so you wait,...8 minutes feels like an eternity! But this in no way will discourage me from returning or recommending the place. Nice job Morehouse!"}
{"text":"It's not often I make it to Downtown Willoughby.  I used to go to Wild Goose for the city's best pizza, so when I heard the same ownership had opened a new joint, I made it a point to stop in the other night.  Set in a location that used to be a rundown bar/nightclub, a complete overhaul has been done.  The front of the dining room has a garage door which opens up onto the sidewalk so walking by, you can catch a whiff of what I was soon to find out, was amazing BBQ.  I sat at the bar as I was waiting for my guest to arrive.  Jason, the bartender presented me with the draft beer list mentioning that all pints were $3 that night (Wed).  While the selection was not as extensive as some of the other bars in Downtown Willoughby, the content and price was on point! I ordered a Great Lakes Edmond Fitzgerald, a great locally brewed Porter.  

 I looked at the menu while enjoying the beer and had decided on the Smoked Mac & Cheese...  When my guest arrived, we opted to stay with Jason at the bar and watch the Cavaliers game which had just started.  I added smoked chicken to the Mac  which arrived arrived within 15 min.   Sauce was rich and creamy with smoky goodness blended in.   

Atmosphere was nice. Dimly lit, conversationally noisy, bar and dining was about 75% full, good for a Wed night.  Staff was pleasant and attentive. 

I don't know if the Morehouse will keep me from getting the city's best pizza  next time I'm in town, but I am glad I gave the place a shot."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was very disappointed  with this place . First off we went there a month after  the scheduled  opening  date and they were still not open . Well  now that we knew they were  officially opened my family  and I came back tonight on oyster nite to see what it was all about . I ordered  the jambalaya  which  was pretty  good except for the portion  size . I could pretty much fit my entrée  in a beer can. Ordered a side of French fries  and they are a mixture  of sweet potato  and regular  fries . Not a fan of sweet potatoes  so i was dissatisfied  with that . They should have  informed  us of that. The beer can chicken was awesome along with brisket . I don't think they really planned out the lighting too well because  we were using flashlight  on cell phones to light up table so we could see our plates .  I left there and ordered a sandwich  from another restaurant  to fufill  my appetite.  All in all I think they need to work  out some kinks and may do well . All other places seem to do very well."}
{"text":"Wow! If I could give 10 stars I would. My first time here and I already can't wait to go back. The atmosphere is gorgeous with plenty of seating. Every employee was so pleasant and welcoming. Our waitress was full of knowledge and I really appreciated the fact that if she didn't know the answer, she actually went to the chef to ask. We had the short ribs and salmon. The plating was almost too beautiful to touch! The food was cooked to perfection. Nothing was left on our plates, which is super rare for me. Also, I'm a bit of a cornbread snob. I'm very picky. I actually ordered an extra side of it because it was THAT good. And they make their own spread! It almost turned the cornbread into a dessert. Speaking of, we ordered the waffles with cinnamon ice cream and raspberry drizzle for dessert. Heaven on a plate. I almost hugged the waitress, I was so impressed. Seriously, try this place and you'll understand my new obsession. All that food plus 2 beers was about $48. I'm so blown away. Writing this review makes me want to head up there right now!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to love this place and we tried like crazy to. We just were unable to pull it off. 

It was a busy Sunday so we understand that it took our server awhile to get to us which we completely understood. We ordered the mussel appetizer and it was delicious so we had high hopes for a meal. We then ordered the Morehouse platter which is all of the meats and all of the sauces and sadly we were quite disappointed. For $28 the portions were quite small, over smoked, and salty. The chicken, which were legs and thighs were so over smoked and overcooked that they were inedible. The brisket was in small pieces and covered in sauce and the pulled pork was fatty. We were hungry when we walked in and the same way when we left because we didn't want to finish. When the server came back and asked if she could get us anything else and we said just to check, just the sheer amount of food that we left that we didn't want to take to go should have had her asking if everything was okay but she didn't say anything.

This place had such great Yelp ratings that maybe they were just having a really off day but our date nights are too few and far between that we won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The fried chicken, smoked mac-n-cheese and catfish sliders were all excellent.  Also enjoyed the cranberry bourbon cocktails.  Decor inside is very nice, with exposed brick walls.  Very happy to have a New Orleans style restaurant in Willoughby - Morehouse gets it right!"}
{"text":"This is a welcomed addition to downtown Willoughby and exactly my kind of place.  The inside has a large bar for patrons and also different dining areas.  The outdoor patio will be a great place to hang out come summertime.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but the food and drinks have an upscale feel.  There are several craft beers on tap and they did change between my visits.  They do offer happy hour specials as well.  

The food is outstanding.  I've already sampled several items on the menu and now I find it hard to settle on what to order!  One of my favorites is the shrimp and grits.  However, I would be just as happy ordering off of their side menu.  The french fries are a shoestring combination of regular and sweet potato.  The hushpuppies are the best I've had in a while.  My favorite side is the smoked mac n cheese.  I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening after catching a movie. Was seated immediately in the dining area which is away from the bar. However, there are TVs in this section if you still wanted to see the game and not necessarily be by the bar. Our server was extra attentive and we didn't feel rushed once we finished our meals and sat talking for a little while. She even continued to ask us if we needed anything after we settled the check.

The menu has a good selection and we settled on the homestyle fries, crab tacos, and Cajun shrimp and cheesy grits, which turned out really well. This is someplace I would visit again."}
{"text":"Checkout the menu online. Looking forward to the \"Southern BBQ \". So disappointing.  Had to send back the Fried Green Tomato appetizer. How do you screw that up? Over fried to the point that the tomato inside was stringy and the breading on the tomato was so thick and burnt.I tasted all 4 pieces and not 1 was palatable. The brisket, ribs and pulled pork were so dry. They were probably days old. The only good item was the fried chicken and waffles. Probably because these items need to be prepared fresh. Would definitely not recommend this place for anyone wanting quality BBQ."}
