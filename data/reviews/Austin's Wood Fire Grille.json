{"text":"Restaurant used to be better. Was in last week (end Feb-08) and the waiter we had just sucked. The food took almost an hour to get to the table (it was an easy order). At least it was decent when it got there.  Otherwise, good location, nice decor, great potential. How hard is it to hire decent wait staff?! There's one or two waiter(ess) that are great, and the others just suck. The guy we had last seemed like he just got out of rehab. I think he still had the shakes. When I asked about a dish he said \"so what about it\". Well geeze dum-F, you tell me. That's why I'm asking.  Also seems like a lot of the bar-losers crowd anymore too. If that's what your into. Sometimes a couple cougars. Mostly old sausage factory tho. Thank goodness it's smoke-free in Ohio anymore. Otherwise the place would be a write-off."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and it has never disappointed us. Happy Hours are great!  Especially because of Carmen the bartender. He is attentive but not smothering.  The appetizers are delicious.  The luncheon menu has some great soup and salads.  And when you don't feel like cooking on Friday night or Sunday afternoon the dinner menu will satisfy your taste buds.  Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Came back for a visit after moving from the area. The food at Austin's is better than ever. I had the crab cakes and grilled shrimp. Fabulous!  My husband had the swordfish. Also wonderful. Prices are still appropriate and the waiter and employees are excellent. The atmosphere is very comfortable and clean. Best restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Burger was awesome.  Best I've had in a long time.  Wife had honey garlic chicken that was also very good.  Service was on par."}
{"text":"Went for a rehearsal dinner.  Everything was great.  Starting with the great tasting wine, chicken/balsamic flatbread, cheese dip with fresh pita, and bread baked in the wood-fired oven, they did well.  I think I liked my broccoli side more than the steak!  To top it off, the Key Lime pie and tiramisu were good.  The wait staff was polite and attentive.  The kid's menu wasn't just mac & cheese, but had dishes we want our kids to eat.  Nice work, Austin's."}
{"text":"While the food was excellent,  we had very slow service and a rude comment from our waiter David.  When paying for our meal we used a gift certificate and inadvertently had an expired coupon behind the gift card.  When David came back to our table he said \"nice try.\"  Really?  A simple I'm sorry sir but this coupon has expired would have sufficed especially since we didn't realize the coupon was there AND we were with guests!!!"}
{"text":"We had a $25 gift card and wanted to have dinner before heading to playhouse square.  I was a bit apprehensive based on all of the google, yelp, and other reviews I looked at when making the reservation, but we were pleasantly surprised by our experience.  Making the online reservation was easy, but unnecessary for our Friday night arrival at 5:30pm.  We were promptly greeted by our waitress Jacqueline, who was friendly and attentive throughout the dinner.  We ordered soft drinks, which were quickly provided.  We both ordered the French onion soup, which was fantastic.  It looked just like the picture from the review below.  I think it was maybe 2-3 minutes from order to service for the soup.  We ordered our meals, and I order the NY strip and my wife ordered the crab stuffed orange roughy.  They have an extensive menu of appetizers, and a nice variety of beef, seafood, sandwiches, and a few other dinners.  They also had 3 seafood specials which were not on the menu.  My wife absolutely loved the fish, and I thought the steak was very good.  I had the steak fries and rice, which were more than adequate.  Our meals were also brought promptly, and everything flowed nicely, giving us adequate time to relax and have plenty of time to make the show.  As others have mentioned, the menu is somewhat pricey throughout (hence 4 stars vs. 5), but the restaurant did have a nice appearance and ambiance and to some extent more understandable.  Overall a nice experience, especially since we had the gift card."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Austin's several times and always find the food to be excellent.  Their steaks are terrific and done correctly.  Fish and pastas are also very good.  This restaurant is no more \"pricey\" than many others in this caliber. More upscale than a casual resaurant.  There is even live music on the weekends.  Decor and atmosphere are great.  Terrific \"happy hour.\"  Have also hosted a large dinner party at Austin's.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  The food was great.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"average food, for the price i was really expecting better quality."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if that was possible. Where do I start? Well, I went to this restaurant on a whim with my girlfriend and another couple of friends. My friends wife's steak was dry and overcooked. My girlfriends blackened chicken came out like it was heated up in the microwave. I ordered beef fajitas and got chicken, I will say the waiter said he would take it back, however, it took about 15 minutes for him to take our drink orders and another 15 for us to get them so I didn't feel like starving to death. The waiters name is Kevin who only came to the table twice the entire 3 hours we were there. We only got drinks a second time because we had to flag him down. Which I then ordered a grey goose martini with a twist of lime and recieved a dirty martini with no lime. He forgot our bread  we had ordered. We all had empty glasses of water the entire night and we also told him it was a split check when we got there then went ahead and put it all on one. To top it off he had the entire order split incorrectly when he finally came back an hour later. The manager came out and gave us gift cards to go back there. I don't even want to use them because I was disgusted by the service and sub par food."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, wine,  and food.  They will go out of the way to accommodate needs. I have a friend who is gluten free and one who is vegetarian.  Although I wish austins had more options on their regular menu for them, they do try to serve them to their best ability.  I do not have a special diet and have had several things off their menu and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly (sorry I forgot your name!), and the pizza appetizer (which I saw recommended here on Yelp) was very good. Also, the wood fire is a cozy touch! Other than that, I wasn't thrilled. The prices are high and the food is OK. While we didn't dislike anything we ate, we certainly didn't love anything."}
{"text":"Gotta love Austin's...well, at least their ribs, which is what I usually get and they're prob the best around.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Where to start, so much went wrong.  No vallet.  No coat service.  Waiter took forever to take our orders.  Then it took forever to get the food.  3 hour dinner, seriouslly!  The rice had a pound of salt in it.  Cold.  Shrimp was ok.  My friends veal chop was hideously spiced.  Yeah, not going back"}
{"text":"I was recently here for Kristin R's baby shower luncheon and I was impressed. The space was open yet cozy. The server (Kristin) was ah-mah-zing - totally on top of her game - professional, attentive and pleasant. We ordered straight from the lunch menu and I decided on the California Chicken Salad, which was a heaping portion with a good flavor balance. This was a perfect place for this sort of gathering as they enabled the hostesses to bring in their own cake and candy for a candy favor bar. If I were in the area, I would certainly return to give another option on the menu a whirl. Thank you, Austin's Wood Fire Grille for helping to make my friend's celebration so special!"}
{"text":"We had the pizza appetizer that they offer and it was AWESOME! My cousin had breaded chicken, which was average, and I had the salmon which was amazing! The loss of the star comes only from the poor presentation.  Coming from LA to visit family in Brecksville, I have pretty high expectations of my food's presentation.  This was not quite the par that I am used to, especially for the price in Brecksville.  Still, a great place to check out with a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"First visit was amazing back in December. Service fantastic and friendly !   Food very very good .. coming back for our anniversary in March"}
{"text":"I met 2 friends here for lunch today. One had the steak/spinach salad and another ordered the smoked turkey club sandwich, while I had my usual pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. The sandwich is fantastic and a favorite, with the cost at $9.99. The only negative was probably the cost of their house merlot at $7.00"}
{"text":"The pork chop is the best. The bartender is great. Sit at the bar and have a great meal."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and nephew joined me for dinner on a Saturday evening here. It already had great reviews so we had high expectations.  Our first encounter with our waiter was a very pleasant one. He was friendly, offered dinner suggestions and really knew the menu. After receiving our drinks we were served a basket of bread and butter. It was fresh and tender with a homemade taste. Our dinners consisted of French Onion soup followed by prime rib, a baked potato, & broccoli, parmesan crusted chicken with garlic parmesan fries, broccoli, followed by creme brulee, steakhouse fries, and a half slab ribs with Mac n cheese and cole slaw. Some of us tried each others meals to share in the experience. The unanimous conclusion was that it was all fantastic. The food, the atmosphere, the wait staff...everything was better than expected. It was nice to see a few families were celebrating different occasions. There was a TV at the bar, too. I would call this location classy and comfortable. Check out the daily specials and stop by for an evening of mouth watering food with friends."}
{"text":"We had dinner on a Friday night, best steak fajitas I have ever had.  The bread they serve is worth the trip alone!  Seasonal draft beer and martinis were perfect, and our server Michelle was spot on.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is very mediocre.  Ribs were good.  The rest of the meal was not.  Service was OK.  Would not go again.  Originally gave this place 3 stars, although that was a bit generous.  Changed it to one star.  The person I had dinner with sent me a picture of the chicken she took home as leftovers.  Completely raw chicken!"}
{"text":"I always try to visit a restaurant at least twice before reviewing it on Yelp.  We had the opportunity to visit Austin's in Brecksville, Ohio for brunch in March and again for dinner in April of 2018.  We thoroughly enjoyed each of our visits!  The aroma of the wood-burning oven that permeates the parking lot is tantalizing!  The interior is surprisingly uplifting even though the decor is rustic.  We ate brunch next to a stone fireplace that might grace the wall of a ski lodge in Vail, Colorado.  Framed cigar labels and antique fishing baskets further enforced the masculinity of the restaurant.  We enjoyed spicy bacon bloody marys and craft beers during our brunch visit.  Our waitress was lovely and she let us visit with each other prior to ordering.   I had the Steak and Eggs with scrambled eggs and it was amazing!  I prefer my steak rare (raw) and my breakfast did not disappoint.  The entire meal was enjoyable!  Others in our party enjoyed sunny-side up (dippin') eggs and Breakfast Club sandwiches.    The craft beers here are delicious (as our male-counterparts can attest to).  We LOVED Austin's so much that we made reservations for a Saturday night after the Temptations/Four Tops concert at the Hard Rock.  One of our friends is gluten intolerant and she found several gluten-free options on the menu.  The burgers are EXCELLENT!  We love this place and look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a random weeknight and it happened to be BOGO Ribs night. The waiter was nice enough to have the kitchen split the order on 2 plates and we ordered 2 carb sides so hubby got his fries and I got mine.  Started with 2 cups of soup. The chowder was super creamy and the french onion was a nice beefy balance without too much salt.  The bread cutting board was served with a chewy Italian and sweet mini cornbread cupcakes.  If you aren't used to southern cornbread it is a bit shocking... and adding butter would be overkill... but they were moist and tasty.  Forgot to take pictures of the ribs they were gone so fast.  Fall off the bone good. Would order again... and $19 for a full rack is a good deal... would not buy at twice that price on any other day.  There were only 2 other parties in the restaurant and the bar was not even half full and the place was oddly loud.  Agree with others that the prices seem rather high, but they have a set daily special listed on their website so you could plan ahead and get a decent deal."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a week night.   It wasn't too busy. The service was pretty good. I had to ask twice for water. Why only 2 stars? Both dishes we ordered were not up to expectation. We had the chicken parmesan. The chicken itself was well cooked, good breading. The pasta the same. But the sauce was more like a spicy Mexican sauce. And it was very salty.  The other dish was the fish stuffed with crab. Both the grilled asparagus, which was well done and grilled, as well as the fish itself were covered in salt. The baked potato I got with the meal, also coated in salt. The chef definitely loves salt.  We're not talking that they all tasted salty, I mean literally each dish looked like it was rolled in rough ground salt"}
{"text":"We came here for mother's day this year and we were not impressed. The outside of the restaurant and the interior are very nice, but the food is not the greatest. You pay pretty high prices, but the quality is not synonymous with the price. I don't think we will ever go back, but if the prices were a bit lower to meet the quality of their food then we may consider going back."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice and the smell of a wood fire is great. I wish I could say the same for the food. The Cesar salad was very bland and had a lot of lettuce ends. The croutons were as had as bricks. The Delmonico steak was a little over done (I ordered it med-rare) and it seemed very thin. I would have expected more. The garnish was a bore. My wife tried the tips and mushrooms. It should have been called \"tough and chewy  tips and mushrooms\". It came with red skin mashed potatoes that were covered with green something. The wine by the glass was a little pricey. After $70+ I was longing for the Outback."}
{"text":"Best Beer Cheese Soup in town! (Too bad  they don't serve it daily...) Carmine (the bartender= the BEST) My favorite meal their hands down is the Buffalo Chicken Salad with Blue Cheese! If you get it at lunch, added bonus is their delicious carrot muffin! YUMMM"}
{"text":"I live in Brecksville and am very close to Austin's.  I don't normally frequent very often due to the fact that prices are a bit on the high side and the end product doesn't seem to match.  I received notice of a Groupon that cost $20 for $40 worth of food at Austin's...I thought what the hell and I will give it another shot.    I asked my girl if she wanted to go and I met her at home after work.  We hopped on my Goldwing and rode on over.  We walked in and I asked if it was ok to use the Groupon the same day and I was assured it was.  We were seated and made small talk with the manager about an open position for a cook.  I told him my girl is the Steak Master and she is THE BAR against their steaks tonight.  I ordered a Medium Rib eye and she ordered a Medium Filet with Béarnaise sauce.  We both ordered a Caesar salad which tasted phenomenal.  Very light oil based dressing, not a lot of cream but very peppery light and Mediterranean tasting.  Dinner rolls were also served, both corn muffins & sourdough.  The sour dough were hot and the corn muffins were cool.    Steaks came out together.  The waiter (who was very helpful) did not immediately ask if steaks were cooked to order.  The Medium Filet came out perfect, thick cut and cooked stellar.  The taste was right on and perfectly moist.  My steak however, the Medium Rib eye was cooked a bit over Medium, somewhere between Medium and Medium well.  Further, for a Rib eye, it did not have the juicy taste I am accustomed to when I have tasted other Rib eyes.  I was extremely hungry so I ate.  Eventually the waiter came back out and asked how all was.  I told him mine was a bit over cooked but I was too hungry so I started eating and it was ok...he said are you sure and on 2nd thought I was like yea sure take it back.  The manager came out (knowing I told him my girls steaks were the bar and he is not up to it!) and apologized and I said sorry for eating half of it and he said not to worry and that id get a lot more to eat as he was firing another steak.  After awhile my 2nd steak was brought out.  Upon knifing the portion, it melted like butter.  Something seemed off...I cut a second slice and viewed the color and noticed this Steak was Medium Rare. Phil the manager was not too far behind and quickly saw this was too rare.  He took the plate and had it refired.  Shortly after the dish was brought out and while although slightly extra blackened on some spots, I ate it as I was very hungry and it appeared to be Medium this time.  Seasoning was mildly salty, and still seemed to be lacking something that other Rib eyes have...maybe freshness?  Phil told us he would be comping the Rib eye and told us we could use the Groupon another night if we wanted to.  I decided to use the Groupon (I have purchased two today).  Overall, I went here because of the price break.  The food was good (once cooked properly, at least my dish!) but not stunning.  I'm glad for the coupon because I do not think they have right price points.  I have one more Groupon to use.  I will go back because of the deal, however I am not overly drawn to this establishment as it can be consistently lacking in various parts be it preparation, taste, or service.  The ambiance is very nice.  The manager did the right for us & and wait staff seemed to be good until after he was notified dinner was comped and I paid tip and tax.  Strange ...perhaps he was just busy.  I will give benefit of doubt.  I suspect they will be getting lots of groupon customers soon!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  Nice and quiet.  Great service. Unsweetened Ice tea- good French onion soup is good Blackened grouper tacos are delicious!!!!!!! Mac n cheese is good Chicken pesto sandwich is good French dip sandwich is very tender and good."}
{"text":"Went for New Year's Eve with the family. \"Special New Years menu\" same frigin menu with jacked up prices. That's tacky. I had the prime rib which was a prime rip off! Don't claim to be a steak house and screw up prime rib. Been here three times or so over the year never going back."}
{"text":"The surfnturf has no price on the menu, get ready to pay 69.99 for that dish,  for that price they shoulda thrown in the whole cow. for a party of 4 we paid 250 dollars. not worth it at all. for that kinda money u could feed ten people at longhorn. maybe I was there on the wrong night, but I was  not impressed at all. The food was ok at best. the service was aiight. save your money , keep going down Brecksville rd , come to my house, ill feed u steak for half the price and double the enthusiasm"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Met the extended family here for a Friday night dinner as the bartender comes highly recommended. Not the most exciting location (in a strip mall), though easy to get to from the highway.  I think the place wants to be white linen tablecloth but isn't quite there yet.   Pretty decent wine list, including some very reasonably priced bottles. Most of us got a form of steak, and i was really impressed. I ordered my New York strip cooked medium, and it was actually medium (I didn't have to order medium rare hoping for medium). Pretty standard if uninspired side dishes."}
{"text":"I love to sit at the bar and talk with Carmen the bartender. He should be working in NYC or Chicago.   He always has a great suggestion on a wine or dinner item.   Carry on!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. David was attentive and didn't leave us waiting for anything. Would definitely come back. The tenderloin salad was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal there tonight.  I had the 18 ounce T-bone with bleu cheese and bacon, baked potato and sweet potato fries.  My wife had the crab-stuffed orange roughy, baked potato and vegetable medley.  Everything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and delicious.  Service was good, nice ambiance and decor,  My dinner was $29.99, and my wife's meal was $19.45, more than what we usually spend for dinner out, but it was well worth it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice-for lunch. We have been satisfied both times that the service was above average as was the food. It is a little difficult to locate, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Was visiting colleagues in Brecksville on a business trip and they brought me to Austin's for lunch.  When we got out of the car in the parking lot I could smell the BBQ-y deliciousness and was very excited!  I settled on the pulled pork sandwich (good) and the coleslaw (disappointing).  Their homemade lemonade tasted like Mountain Dew so I needed it to be watered down - waaaaay to sweet for my taste, and I'm not quite sure if there was actual fresh lemon juice in it as I saw no pulp and it was greenish in tint.  I'm a lemonade snob; I admit it.  The ambiance was great.  Very nicely decorated and it wasn't crowded at all during peak lunch hours (which stinks for them, but was perfect for me as I am not a fan of noisy restaurants).  The service, on the other hand, was spectacular.  Our waiter was incredibly proactive, accommodating, friendly and prompt.  I was blown away by the service and wish we had more waiters like him in California!!"}
{"text":"I've been 3 times for work lunches and had a good experience each time, was able to get back to work at decent time due to speedy service and I enjoyed the soup, sandwich and salad I ordered each time. Food is good, but not extrodinary. If you're looking for more of an experience, there are other area options I prefer, but this place is a good choice for a bite."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that shouldn't fail. This should be a great place. It is in a good location. The decor is very nice, if not somewhat uninspired. The bar is very nice. There is a city-full of ready made customers. They purport to be a wood-fired grill....who wouldn't love that?  But the food just isn't good enough to justify the prices and the servers aren't attentive enough to be memorable.  Although this place has a lot going for it, I don't know if they have a future. It is sad. I really want to love this place."}
{"text":"I live 10 minutes from Austin's, and as my wife and I eat out several times a week we'd LOVE for this place to be worth a crap. Not happening. At least we'll never know it because we're never going back.   We have tried it three times and every time the food was either1) tasteless 2) poorly cooked 3) tasteless.  What, I said that already? That's because once wasn't enough.    Here's how bad Austin's is: I'd rather go to Boneyard in Broadview Heights, and I HATE that place.   Really, just go out of business already and do us all a favor."}
{"text":"Ok, any restaurant that serves warm bread is starting off with a star. Then, if the bread is crusty flakey on the outside and s good chew on the inside, two stars. Very nice decore, perfect level of ambiance. Calamari is a little different as it is not really breaded and cut into rubber band shapes but the pineapple and hot sauce with it are delicious. The crab cakes and shrimp are yummy especially the two sauces they serve with this dish but I have to say the baked potato was especially tasty. My husband ordered the tips and was able to have the broccoli and roasted asparagus since he's trying to avoid starch. It was tasty but no big deal. He also ordered the caprese and it had flavorful tomatoes which totally makes a difference. My son altered the black and blue burger to just a burger with lettuce and tomato. Good burger but a little too much bun. I had the crab cake and coconut shrimp plate. All delicious but don't fill up on yummy bread and hor' doeuvres before hand. Our waiter was David. He was great. Food came out timely. Lots of families but well behaved kids. Dessert menu looked awesome but we were full so we have to return."}
{"text":"Had the 10 oz prime rib, was cool might have sat at the window a bit too long. The twice baked loaded potato was overcooked, the cheese had turned into concrete. The shrimp cocktail was tasty. The experience was Meh."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 7pm, and there were only 2 other tables. I was very surprised at how dead this place was. The food was just ok, pricey for the quality. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. There is a very large wine list and extensive alcohol selection. Seems like maybe a better place for a few drinks at the bar and appetizer, although this is clearly set up for dinner to be the main purpose. Overall, was not too impressed and won't return."}
{"text":"It was time for a steak!  We both usually order filets when available.  The lady stayed the course, I unfortunately did not!  I was swayed by the tag-line under their \"cowboy steak\", a ribeye, billed as their \"most flavorful.\"  The part they failed to advertise, was that it was also the most silver-skin, connective tissue and fat.  I haven't worked as hard to get a bite on my fork in memory.  No it was not overcooked, ( a very lightly done medium-rare),   Upon arriving, a couple of plates passed by with beautiful looking chunky french-fries atop.   When presented with the potato options, the fries were described as uber-skinny, so that didn't sound like what I had seen, left with sweet potato fries, (described as only slightly larger) and their house jo-jo style potato, I thought maybe what I;d seen were skinny jo-jos, so that's what I ordered.   They serve a house beer bread and what sounded like carrot rolls when described, but manifested as corn bread rolls if taste and look didn't fail me.  For me the bread was WAY too sweet..almost dessert-like.  Didn't have room for the corn bread, but the lady only took a bite or so of her's, so no accolades were suggested.   The lady said her filet was a 10, the mac and cheese a 4 and the broccoli a 6 (a bit under-cooked).  My steak was a resounding 3, a more than adequate challenge to the serrated edged steak-knife! The two lonely parmesan dusted jo-jo wedges, suggestive of a severe potato shortage, were maybe a 5, the smoked chicken chowder was a solid 7.5 ( a few too many under-cooked potato chunks!)  I'm sure my experience would have been better had I stuck with a filet, but I was truly shocked by the nastiness of my steak...I've had much lesser cuts, e.g. sirloin, at chain restaurants, and even chuck steaks that were far superior to  this p.o.s.! Service was efficient and attentive.  The side dining area where we were seated was modern-fishing lodge decorated...visually entertaining if somewhat counter-intuitive."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was excellent. Love restaurants that serve free bread too! The food was a bit pricey though.  Chicken Alfredo for $17, really??"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, ordered seared ahi tuna salad and prime rib dip sandwich. The restaurant was fairly busy, but we waiting about a half hour for our meal. The salad favors complimented each other, but the lettuce was dead and  wilted. The prime rib sandwich was over cooked and soggy. Barely edible. Best part of the meal was the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Went to Austin's for lunch after finding no suitable toddler seating or handicap accessible seating at their Burger Fresh adjoining restaurant.  Sure glad we did! Since we already were craving burgers, that is what we both ordered.  One was a mushroom burger and the other  cheddar bbq bacon.  One got the fresh cut fries and the other macaroni and cheese for toddler.  When I indulge on a high- calorie-bad-for-you-meal, like this, I want something great.  I was not disappointed!  Fresh cut fries were crispy and brown.  The burger was high-quality,  juicy and tasted great made over the wood fire grill. Mac N cheese was a gooey homemade treat. (did have to send back the first time as it was cold) Lots of pickles on the burgers and a great spear included with the sandwich. The server/bartender was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Three stars is being generous. It really deserves 2.5 stars. I went with my parents. The three of us chose Austin's since there was no wait. We had originally wanted to go to Burntwood Tavern, but it was an hour wait. Austin's on a Friday had absolutely no wait. We saw that as a good thing and started off with the Asian calamari. It was alright. The calamari was fried and coated in a sweet and sour sauce with pineapples, but the sourness of the pineapples overwhelmed the appetizer. My mother ordered a burger while my father and I ordered the New York strip steak. However, while my father did in fact get a NY strip steak, I did not. They did not give me the right steak. To add, I ordered it medium rare, but it was almost a blue steak. It was completely red and inedible. My mother's burger was ginormous, but she did enjoy it. While I did not enjoy the steak, I did like the regular fries and the sweet potato fries. The asparagus was nice too with a wood flavor. Overall, that steak ruined my appetite."}
