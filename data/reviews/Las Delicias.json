{"text":"Pre-gym,  post gym, breakfast, lunch or dinner; this hidden spot is hands down one of the best Columbian joints in the 905.   Empenadas are freshly made in house, chicken or beef soooooo bomb.com and you mist have it with their house made salsa/hot sauce CRACKKKKKKK!!! The heavy hitter of the restaurant is the Bandeja Paisa, this plate has everything your taste buds dreamed of.  Baked beans, plantains, fried egg, flank steak, and the chicharron.  All of this goodness on top of rice.  There's a couple of other restaurants arpund the same area but Las Delicas is BOSS of them all!! All I have to say is come out and try it out, and than tag me because I want to hear your review. Cheers everyone!!"}
{"text":"Welcoming and friendly staff,amazing food, reasonable price. Never mind the location, the food is what matters.  Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"I ate here once about a year ago and i wish i cancome back again.   The portion is huge and i am a big eater.  Food is on the heavy side.   I heard it is authentic Columbian food.   Great to go in  the summer because you will feel like you are in another country. I  recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something different."}
{"text":"Best Colombian  food  in Mississauga and one of the best ones in the gta . When I'm craving grandma's food there is where I go.  I really enjoy their lunch special which vary every day  (soup, meat, rice, salad and sometimes cake) For special occasions (mother's day, thanksgiving, Christmas) they offer a special dish as well, always delicious.   Portions are generous and well priced.  If you are don't have a huge appetite enjoy a Colombian coffee and a bu√±uelo.  As a bread lover I always ask to go a 'Pan camaron' (Shrimp bread, because its shape no because it taste) which is huge and full of cheese,  baked fresh  daily.  Great costumer service."}
{"text":"In the heart of the city hidden in a small lot. This is the place to have great Colombian.  The decor is not fancy but who cares the food is great. The people that work there are also great very helpful.  Huge portions and I mean huge.  This is a must go place. Great prices for the same price as a burger you get a great meal. See pictures."}
{"text":"I have been to many different cuisines but this one was my first Colombian meal.... and I have to say they did not disappoint me. This is a low key family owned restaurant with exception service.  The owner is very friendly and helpful with the menu and suggestion on what is best. The restaurant itself was quite clean and you can see one lady making the meal live at the back. The menu has quite a few option and is not too harsh on the pocket.   I was there with too of my other co-workers so we wanted to try multiple thing.  For starts we had I think \"Empanada\" it like stuffed bread fried with shredded chicken or beef and then he gave a special sauce with it. I loved the sauce it was awesome... a great combination of coriander and peppers.  for the main course we tried ordered 3 separated dished. First being Arepas which is like their street food. It like tacos or sandwich in a pita... the shredded chicken glued with melting cheese was quite good.   Then we ordered a chicken dish.. which came with grilled check with rice and salad as well as very taste beans and very sweet fried plantain.  Then it was time to try a fish dish also recommended by the owner... The dish had salad and Two pieces of grilled fish with corn bread. The fish tasted very fresh and it was awesome.  Over all it was a very good experience and I would definitely go again to this location."}
{"text":"My first time trying Colombian food and it was so enjoyable!! The service here is so friendly; I was greeted with smiles all around. You can really tell that this is an independently owned mom and pop shop where the owners and employees enjoy the company of their customers. The waitresses exchanged conversations (all conducted in Spanish) with the customers and clients.  I had no clue what to order, and so carefully observed what surrounding tables got. A couple of customers had this big bowl of soup in front of them, served with a heap of rice, a slice of very ripe and beautiful avocado, a banana, and a small container of dairy (full fat cream or milk). Seeing that this was a very popular dish, I asked for it. The soup is called Ajiaco, and it was definitely not the sancocho or mondogo featured on the menu. The waitress told me that this was a special dish served only on Saturdays and Sundays.  The ajiaco soup had lots of potatoes, green peas, chicken breast, and a piece of corn. There were also other herbs and greens that I couldn't quite place my finger on. The small dairy container is meant to be added to the soup - I added a few drops and it really did accentuate and richen the flavour. Without it, the soup is still flavourful but slightly bland.  I also tried my friend's bandeja - if you're looking for the biggest bang for your buck, definitely go for this dish! It comes with a friend egg, chorizo, pork belly, steak flank, beans, and rice. I had a piece of the pork belly and it was absolutely out of this world! It was unbelievably crispy; though erring on the dry side, it was super flavourful and fatty. I'm a sucker for crispy food, and it didn't disappoint.  Additionally, I sampled my friend's appetizer, the salchipapas. Sliced sausages came served on a bed of fries with a small boiled quail egg on the side. This dish tasted absolutely amazing with the salsa. Actually - the salsa really added flavour to everything! It was the best salsa I've ever had!!  We also tried the Colombiana, a Fanta like drink. I didn't find it particularly special, but we most definitely order the lulo juice next time I come! I must also try the empanadas next time."}
{"text":"I've been appreciating and searching for Latin American cuisine lately and so far i've been quite pleased with the variety of offerings. I was in Mississauga so did a quick search and Las Delicias was pretty much up there with solid reviews. The Colombian restaurant had to be authentic  as I felt like a fish out of water looking at the decor and the customer base. As I was trying to make sense of the menu , the lady at the front was nice enough to recommend the bandeja paisa which was supposedly the most popular dish. With it I also ordered some taco like sandwich with chicken and chicharon and some flan for dessert.  The bandeja paisa itself was a bit insane. Really breakfast and lunch in one meal. Sausage, beans, egg, and beef, fried pork belly, and some corn bread. Each item by itself wasn't amazing. But all elements combined along with that chilli dipping sauce they provide is something  would definitely order regularly. I was too full to fully appreciate that taco thing but that was good also.  If there was a con, I'd say the pork belly could have been more crispy but other than that really enjoyed it and for the prices, absolutely worth it.  When trying out a new cuisine  the servers typically asks how I liked the food. Even If I hated it I still say I enjoyed it. In this case I think the cleaned up plates said more than any words could."}
{"text":"Another International Supper Club evening with a group of awesome yelpers who are all about sampling the schmorgesborg of international eats we have at our fingertips in the #905 area of the GTA.   Las Delicias has been noted as nothing much to look at from the outside, which is why you might completely drive by this tiny shop buried in the extreme corner of strip mall near Dundas and Hurontario. However this tiny authentically Colombian shop is pushing out big smiles, huge portions and even bigger flavours for customers. Oh and to counter balance all this big talk... the prices are super cheap. Boom!  It's got maybe 18 seats total so our group of 8-10 took up a good portion of the dining space, however, we were the only ones sitting down to eat as the majority of the traffic (and there was a lot) was take out, so don't feel like you \"have to\" stay in and eat.  To start I got a Colombian Kola beverage which tasted like Coke or Pepsi but with another cup of sugar, not too sweet but definitely sugary. I loved it! For the table I got a few orders of Empanadas. They split the orders up between chicken/beef and cheese. These were UNREAL. Crispy and piping hot on the outside, soft/gooey and flavourful on the inside. Paired with the salsa-esque sauce they provide in hot and mild on the side to dip and BAM... a flavour explosion that will make your toes curl!  I easily could have just had a dozen empanadas and a kola and been happy, but the menu here was so vast with so many items on it, I had to control myself and order something popular and authentically Colombian. Myself and most of the members of our group ordered the most popular item which was the Bandeja Paisa. This dish was insane... the plate was overflowing with food. The Bandeja Paisa came with: fried pork belly, flank steak, fried eggs, fried plantain, rice and beans, an arepa and Colombian sausage. Holy crap! I could barely finish my mean. The plantain, sausage and rice and beans were unexpectedly awesome (usually not my fave menu items), the flank steak was flavourful but a tad tough (common however, in thinner cuts of beef), and the pork belly while flavourful was a tad too much for me after about my 8th or 9th piece (they give you a LOT!  Add to the food the fact that the service was so friendly and helpful, I cannot wait to come back and try some other items.   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem is the wilderness of Mississauga. Chicharrones were out of this world, Empanadas were worth the endless procession of strip malls you need to pass to get there. 100% legit: no Australian hipsters selling you \"fusion tacos\" from an ipad."}
{"text":"I went to Peru last year and was pretty thrilled to find a place like this. It certainly has a unique vibe to it, similar to how I felt when I ate in Peru. It's not a pretentious place. It has a homey feel to it which I enjoy.  I did my homework and saw lots of pictures of bandeja paisa and being the meat lover I am, I got that. It's indeed one of the best bang for your buck meals out there considering how much meat is there. Easily sharable for 2 people. All the meats are good, and I especially love the crispy pork. Kind of like Chinese BBQ pork but more crunchy. They raised the prices compared to what I saw in yelp pics but hey, it's 2018. It's still a good price.  I didn't get anything else but would love to come again. I can't emphasize enough the homey vibe I got from this place and how pleasant that was. A guy welcomed me and talked to me. The lady brought out my food and gave me a bowl of spicy sauce. It was like I was a guest at someone's house. Very warm, and of course, it was delicious. I definitely come back for other dishes and maybe some empanada for snack."}
{"text":"This place was so good.  The staff was great and did I say the food was sooo good. I'm so full for only $12 that I think the next time I eat will be tomorrow.  You so have to try this place"}
{"text":"I was unable to make the CMYE: International Supper Club to this place because I was in Chicago that week, so I decided to check this place out on my own.  I got the Bandeja Paisa, which included pork belly, skirt steak, sausage, an egg, rice and beans and I think it was $12 before tax, which is an excellent deal.  The value is absolutely amazing and the overall taste is great.  However, I found the steak to be a bit too cooked for my liking and the pork belly a bit too fatty and chewy.  I did love the sausage, beans and rice though.  All the flavours combined to make an excellent meal.    In addition, I also got one empanada for $1.50 and it was hot, crispy on the outside and nice gooey filling on the inside. Much much better than My Empanada (which is up the street).    Overall, if you like meat cooked (as opposed to rare or medium rare) and are not on any type of diet, then this is a pretty good place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was super busy.  Had to do take out.  I ordered the pork belly which was a steal at 3.00 a piece and the chicken and beef empanadas.  The pork belly was good, mostly because its such a deal, whereas the empanadas weren't so good.  The chicken empanadas were super dry.  The shell itself was too soft for my liking.  The beef empanadas had no beef except one sliver basically.  It's all plantain in there. Again, it lacked taste."}
{"text":"Las Delicias is AMAZING.   Service is awesome, the ladies in the front always remember my husband and I and make us feel right at home.   Their bandeja paisa is awesome, it's pretty close to what you would get in Colombia. Everything is well seasoned, every time I've eaten their chicharron it's always perfect. The empanadas are probably one of the better ones I've eaten in Ontario but the real winner here is their churros.   The churros they make are not like mexican churros, these are arequipe filled donut looking things are they taste as if they were made by angels. I know that's pretty far-fetched but that is how good they are especially if you get them fresh.   I will come back for as long as they are in business!!"}
{"text":"In the heart at 5&10 in Mississauga, this is a hidden gem in a strip plaza. Parking is tight, restaurant seating is limited but definitely worth it. As soon as you enter, you can tell that this is a family favourite, especially on a Sunday- very warm and friendly vibe. I stopped in and order a dozen chicken empanadas and a dozen beef. They were freshly and quickly fried up to golden perfection. Light crispy and the chicken at $1.50 was generously filled with seasoned chicken. The beef also at $1.50 were generously filled with tasty beef and potato. The other food coming out of the kitchen also looked fantastic from the soups to rice and pork dishes. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful. I will be back again to try the Bandeja Paisa which looked amazing."}
{"text":"Nice food nice music perfect for saturday lunch! Hot sauce is amazing. wish I could of had some bunuelos but they did not have them ready. The juices were nice as well"}
{"text":"Great little Colombian spot in the corner of this tiny plaza. Despite how it looks (which is what most of Miami looks to me anyways), the does there is worth the visit. Place is tiny bit clean and the people are friendly.   Menu had plenty of options including areas, emapanadas, and lots and lots of meat. The Bandejas Paisa is what almost everyone at our table ordered and it was damn well worth it. A platter of sausage, steak, fried pork belly, plantains, rice and beans makes the meal more than any one man should be able to handle. The steak and sausage were very good. A bit dry but very flavourful especially with the limes that accompany the meal. The pork belly is a chicharron, which is deep fried and comes attached with the pork crackling attached. Real fatty though so you really got to love your pork to enjoy. Rice and beans were perfectly salty and starchy.   The meals are so good and the portion sizes are huge. The emapanadas were the perfect little appetizer before the giant meal. The food is so good that is as addictive as crack!   People who will enjoy it: Meat lovers   People who will not: Vegetarians"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend, and ordered 20 empanadas to take home. When I grabbed the bag the amount of oil still on them made a hole right through the paper bag and was dripping in the car. I grabbed one to taste and even though it was tasty and fresh the amount of oil still on it just overpowered the entire bite. The salsa though mmmmmm so good. I'll come back if I'm in the area and maybe next time I'll stay in and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"We were driving from Ottawa to Detroit and dropped in for dinner and to watch the Colombian World Cup match.  We had our 5 and 3 year old with us. All I can say is that the food was like home cooking which is exactly what we wanted. The people who work there couldn't be nicer and more accommodating, especially with my kids' orders. My husband ordered La Bandeja Paisa and I simply wanted arepa with quest blanco and scrambled eggs (comfort food). It was perfect! I only wish they had more juices available. But if that's my only wish and you are looking for Colombian home cooking (and I am Colombian) and friendly faces, you will enjoy this little find in an otherwise rundown strip mall."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and My bf and I really enjoyed this place a lot!!! This is a small resto in the heart of 5 n 10. It's a hidden Colombian gem!  The place can sit up to ~20 people. The moment you walk in, you are immediately greeted. It can get packed quickly over the weekend. This is a mom and pop place with authentic Colombian cuisine.  We ordered the Bandeja Paisa and carne asada. Lets start with the Bandeja Paisa, it comes with white rice, carne asada (thin juicy skirt steak), sausage, pork belly, beans, plantains and tipped with a fried egg. Come and order this if you're STARVING! The portion is gigantic! Everything tasted great! My only con to this dish would have to be the pork belly skin isnt as crispy as i would liked it to be. But it was still great!  Next, the carne asada mmmm. No complains for me here! Came with rice, beans, carne asada, and plantains. Delicioso!  Try their beef empanadas please and thank you! Crispy morsel of goodness mmm. Also with mentioning the food i ordered you can NOT forget about the Picante! Ask for their sauce and top that on everything! You wont regret it. PICANTE is colombian's main homemade hot sauce!  Friendly service, we didnt have to wait long for our food to come out. Great Mom and Pop place :)"}
{"text":"I don't know much about traditional Colombian fare, but this seems like the stuff you only get from the kitchen of an abuela slaving over a hot stove. When I visited it was a paunchy middle-aged man, but who the heck cares?! This is comfort food.  If you're a first timer, get the Bandeja Paisa. Comes with beef, deep fried pork belly, sausage, a fried egg, beans, on a bed of rice (plus a small corn cake to boot). It's enough to feed two (if you've got small appetites), but my buddy and I soldiered through the meal like champs. Come hungry.  I'm coming back for the Arepas. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Fantastic. But, disclaimer - this review is based on their empanadas. On the Saturday of a family party, I desperately called around the city looking for a spot that could make a large batch of empanadas on short notice. Las Delicias said yes instantly, and was so incredibly helpful and friendly. I ordered a tray of 20 empanadas (at $1.50 each), and they were ready within an hour (they were also gobbled up by family members - a total hit).  First, the location. Located just west of Hurontario Street and Dundas Street, don't let the drab exterior fool you. Inside, the place is clean, warm, lively, homey and inviting. Space is limited but there are enough tables if you're visiting as a couple or a small group.  Second, the service. I couldn't thank the servers here enough. So friendly, helpful, and taught us to eat Colombian empanadas the \"right\" way (i.e. cutting the empanadas open and scooping the salsa into it, not dipping the entire empanada into the cup of salsa like us noobs were doing).   Third, the empanadas. For comparison, versus places like Todo Rico and Colombia Mia, these empanadas are a bit different. It's definitely lighter in texture (it isn't hard and crunchy like others I've tried in Mississauga) and the stuffing is pretty substantial (you can really taste and feel the significant amount of meat they stuff into the empanada - good value, and incredibly delicious). If you're debating between chicken or beef, go for the chicken. We compared the two, and the chicken seemed a lot tastier, with more flavour.   We will definitely be back here again. Simple, unpretentious, and fantastic food prepared with care."}
{"text":"Maybe this was just a case of expectations being too high but sadly this place was a bit of a miss in my books. I'd seen the pictures and the fantastic reviews so naturally I was pumped to eat here. I ordered the plate that is mostly meat, and my friend got a dish that also sounded pretty appetizing (I don't recall the names of either but pictures are attached).  The rice dish was alright. It came with corn bread and a slice of cheese that was quite good. The rice component itself though was only okay. It was a decent medley of sausage and beans; just not good enough that I would order it again. It was pretty plain and tasted like something I would throw together at home from leftovers.  The meat dish was the biggest letdown. Everything ranged from super dry to super chewy. It was a bit of a chore to eat to be honest, and we struggled through it.  I'd like to give this place the benefit of the doubt because it does seem to have a dedicated following, especially among locals. Hopefully next time I'll find something I like better on their menu."}
{"text":"Home made Colombian Food at its finest! Its more like a take-out place but there is some seating to sit about 15 ppl. I just love trying out diff colombian restaurants because i loveee trying out diff genres of hispanic food.   I ordered a Bandeja Paisa, which is basically all the meat food groups in one plate. Protein over load! A fried egg, home made sausage, steak, beans, fried pork rinds which is deeeliciouss, fried plantain plus a thick tortilla. All of that on top of white rice. Its just a plate for champions. I ate this as a brunch thing...it was definately worth it. My postobon drink (apple flavoured soda) and the plate was $14 bucks...well worth it. Until next time Las Delicias!"}
{"text":"Authentic Colombian food in Mississauga. First off I've never tried this particular cuisine until my gf took me here and it was delicious. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa which essentially is giant meat platter. Slices of tender carne asada, deep fried pork, chorizo sausage, arepas, plantains and a fried egg on top of a plate of beans and rice make for quite a meal. I finished the entire portion myself but this can easily be shared. A must-try for all meat lovers who like to indulge in a hearty meal.   My gf ordered the carne asada platter which came with a generous portion of thinly sliced, tender beef with beans and rice. She loved it and even that was quite filling.   Lastly, the beef empanadas are amazing. Not too oily and filled to the brim with beef, these empanadas go well with their spicy homemade salsa.   The location itself is in a small strip mall on Dundas, in between Hurontario and Confederation and can get busy and packed at times due to its size. Not sure if you can call ahead to order, but I suggest inquiring about it if you're planning on doing take-out."}
{"text":"The first impression in service was outstanding. The decor is cute. The speed is confusingly fast. And the food was great. I wasn't a huge fan of the pork belly because it was a little crispy and chewy for my liking, but everything else was spot on. The price is high but the portions are HUGE and your plate is loaded with items."}
{"text":"Despite being in the 5&10 \"ghetto\" DO NOT be intimidated about coming here.  Yes, the strip mall looks shady, but Las Delicias is not that bad, so get over the location!  Female waitress was very nice.  I didn't find her English bad at all, but she said people complained to the owner that they couldn't understand her, so you may hafta repeat yourself, but I thought she was very sweet and accommodating, suggesting what was good especially for first-timers!  The menu is double-sided and I *think* the more authentic stuff is on the first page with the arepas and app-type things.  I ordered the Carne Asada (fries & salad, $12) and my friend, the Pollo a la Plancha (with rice, beans, & coleslaw, $12).  I wanted the rice, beans, coleslaw sides, but because mine came with fries + salad (with Italian dressing), it just seemed less authentic to me.  So if you're looking for something more different, go with the rice & beans.  A spicy salsa comes on the side and it is DELICIOUS!  The Bandeja Paisa was recommended, but it just sounded like soo much protein, re:  pork belly, skirt steak, sausage, & an egg!  My next visit, I'll probably try the arepas.  Portions are generous, food was homey, and waitress was very welcoming and sweet.   What else can I ask for?"}
{"text":"My first time trying Columbian food. The steak was really good. I didn't know what to expect but I enjoyed my meal. The baked treats I tried were good too. I will go back and I'll have more to review then."}
{"text":"I went there several days ago.I still remember the friendly staffs, the delicious steak, the great juice and the reasonable price. A good choice to try a colombian meal. Small but busy."}
{"text":"Such awesome experience we had here , food was so good that I couldn't eat it all which is the best because I had it taken for lunch the next day and it was sill delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not exaggerating when I say this place gives me life. I wish it were closer to home because I would eat here weekly. The lady at the front is so sweet and always helps me order new things. I wish I spoke Spanish so we could have deeper conversations, she is a sweetheart. Don't come here expecting some type of text mex meal. The food here is simple, delicious, fresh and fulling. My favourite thing to order is beef empanadas, chicken empanadas, palitos de queso (cheese sticks) and lulo juice. They make the best salsa, I dip everything in it. Ugh thinking about it makes me want a big glass of lulo right now."}
{"text":"What a garbage establishment!  This is the SECOND time I have come here, only to have them tell me they are closed early.   First time at 7pm, this time at 7:10pm. They show a closed time of 7:30.   DO NOT support businesses like this. Get into the 21at century."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Based on the reviews, I had high hopes. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Comida RICO . In from Las Vegas and I live part time in Colombia . The food was perfect in every way for Paisa . Only need some Agulia  Light . Waitress was very friendly and the customers were also good looking . I love my Colombiana's"}
{"text":"I had some empanadas from there, they were sooooooo good. I mean like, really good. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for Colombian food. It's super clean inside, even though the outside looks sketchy. (:"}
