{"text":"New Asian Cafe on du Parc with a pretty interior. But the ambience is confusing. I was the only customer in the entire place. And they still made me seat in a dark corner. The owner and his family were the only other people there and the daughter was playing with her minion toy making music. I just didn't get a professional ambience from the place.

The menu is mainly snacks and bubble tea. I was hoping for coffe but there wasnt any. All the snacks are asian snacks such as dumplings and wontons. I took fried chicken dumplings which were $4.99+tax/4. They tasted pretty great actually. They were prepared fresh and served right off the stove so the insides were warm and tasted delicious. Serving time was 12mins but I was the only customer there. I don't like bubble tea so didn't order any.

I personally think they need to rethink their business strategy to atttact customers in the McGill ghetto area. The pictures of their food are on the board inside and you can't see the menu displayed outside because it's a good distance from the road, almost inside the restaurant. For people passing by, it's not too tempting to go in if they can't even know what's offered inside. I assume that they will get better with time but I probably won't be returning here until I hear something good about them since there are so many competitive options next to this place.

This could've been a good place to study if they had better playlist, they were playing radio music which I find annoying if I want to work. There is free wifi and they accept credit/debit card. Hopefully they will be doing much better in the future."}
{"text":"I'm from Shanghai and they serve Shanghai Wonton. I felt nostalgic today so I went there to have some. It was not totally authentic but it was not bad. They also serve bubble tea, honey toast and a wide range of snacks and food."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy resaurant. The drinks and desserts are very good. Havent tried their meals yet, but it smells so good."}
{"text":"I was initially excited to try this new Chinese place opening so close to my house, but it fell short of expectations. It looks like a cute coffee shop from the outside, but Chillax actually has a full menu ranging from dim sum to fried chicken wings to... shrimp mango salad?

Because it was dinner time, we each ordered a signature stew (the rest of the items seemed expensive compared to Chinatown standards). When the dishes finally came out, they were more like soups. The flavor of the broth was very light - it was basically a bowl of boiled veggies, rice noodles, a few shrimps and half an egg. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. 

I felt that the concept of Resto Chillax is too dispersed. It wants to be:
 - cute and cozy
 - student-friendly 
 - neighbourhood coffee shop
 - Chinese restaurant
 - tea/bubble tea house

With so many aspects, it is difficult for the owners to focus, market the brand and make a strong impression on the clientele. Keeping it simple could do some good."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in for a snack after walking around the city.  It looked like a cute coffee shop and place for snacks.  We had no idea we'd have authentic and delicious pan-Asian food.  I had a fresh watermelon slushy which seemed to be made with fresh watermelon and ice and nothing else.  My friend couldn't stop raving about her chicken dumplings which looked like siu mai and were apparently the best she'd ever had.  The seaweed salad was delicious and light and balanced.  And I couldn't get enough of the lotus leaf-wrapped chicken and mushroom sticky rice, which rivals the best I've had at dim sum places (and I'm from Vancouver!).  The fried fish balls and Japanese (agedashi-styled) tofu were perfectly crispy yet lightly fried and just delicious.  If this place were down the street, I'd pop in every day.  The $3-5 snacks are incredible.  The service is friendly and unassuming."}
{"text":"McGill student's prayers for a great place to go to that's reasonable and close by have been answered! I was really excited when I saw their menu; dumplings this close to McGill campus?! I'm sold! 

I ordered the vegetable wonton soup and they even asked me if I wanted a vegetable or chicken broth (yay for vegetarians!) The soup arrived piping hot filled with fresh vegetables and a very generous amount of wontons. The broth itself was soothing, flavourful, with really well developed flavours. The wontons were incredible, cooked perfectly and the stuffing was so fresh. 

The restaurant itself is well lit and has a really cosy feel that's going to be great for Montreal winters. The ambience is great, clean and well decorated which is a step above your typical asian place. Most asian places within this price range do not make you want to go there and catch up with a friend who you haven't seen in a while (usually you just want to get in and get out!). 

Overall; fantastic food, friendly service, cosy atmosphere and for a really good price. I'll be returning to try a lot more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Très bon petit resto sichuanais. On a partagé le poulet popcorn et les wontons aux arachides et sésame, excellents!

On a aussi pris une ramen aux légumes qui était correcte, sans plus.

À boire: slush à la fraise et à la pêche, miam!"}
{"text":"I ordered their lunch special wanton chicken soup and spring rolls. My friend ordered the chicken cutlet salad. Both dishes were just ok. The soup was too salty. The place has a good ambience with free WiFi.  I would have to go back to try their other specialities or desserts. But atleast my experience today was not a great one."}
{"text":"I came to Chillax twice and always go for their sweet treats: honey toast with ice-cream and fruits as toppings, and I love my experience there! The bistro is a tiny place that is not very invisible on Parc Avenue, it's quiet and cute, the staff is very friendly and gives honest recommendations. Very good place to chill and relax, like the name Chillax says!"}
