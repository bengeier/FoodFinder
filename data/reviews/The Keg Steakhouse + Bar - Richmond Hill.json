{"text":"This is my favourite Keg in the GTA. They're the only location that consistently cooks my steak perfectly medium rare and not overdone. I also LOVE their twice baked potato, it's the only place where I actually eat my entire potato. Service is also wonderful every time!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after work tonight, just wanted to grab a bite after a long day... Our waitress was all smiles and very friendly- she brought our apps out fairly quickly and made sure that it was ok too! Our dinner came out shortly after- i got the teriyaki steak and my friend got the chicken. The chicken was perfect and my steak seemed alright at first, but after a few bites i realized that it was cooked a little more than i liked- i had ordered medium but it came out medium-well. I also noticed that the steak seemed a little \"flat\" - i usually order this steak so it was a bit different than what I usually get. Nevertheless, I was starving so I ate most of it. When the waitress came to our table to ask how the meal was going, I casually mentioned to her that the steak was a little too cooked and a bit thinner than usual. She was very understanding and offered a new meal, no problem. I declined as I had already cleared most of it and my potato... She apologized and offered the dessert menu- as we were glancing at it, the manager came over and also said he was sorry that we were disappointed with the meal and he would be more than happy to bring out a new plate next time and that we should let them know if we are unhappy right away- he also comp'd the steak and was very sincere and polite about it as well! We were extremely impressed with the service and the staff there!!! I have to say The Keg has always been my favorite restaurant and my dinner there tonight definitely was no exception to that!!! Exceptional service overall... I highly recommend this place - you won't be disappointed!! :)"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday this weekend.  Despite being a chain restaurant, I like it!  I always look forward to a meal at the Keg because the food and service are consistently good.  Our server was friends and very competent and my baseball steak was cooked to perfection.  I was stuffed, but I had room for a bite of the b-day boy's complimentary Billy Miner's pie.  The Keg loses one star for not accepting reservations."}
{"text":"An early Saturday evening dinner.  Excellent service, excellent food!  All the staff are so well trained.  Our waitress was extremely attentive.  
Onion soup...superb and very hot.
Baseball cut sirloin perfectly cooked.  Order a side of the frizzled onions...they are delicious!
Filet mignon perfectly cooked.  Garlic mashed side goes well.  Bernaise sauce a perfect accompaniment.
Billy Miner pie is the best way to end the meal.  
Amazing how busy they are and you still get great service.  Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"can't go wrong with the steaks here. 

today was Xmas eve, we waited about 40 minutes before we got a table.  drinks, apps, and main took less than  45 minutes... lol tonight was the fastest I have ever experienced food coming out to a table.  as soon as we placed our order, food came within 5  minutes.  we got out drinks, than the bread, than salad and our app... and about 10 minutes later our main courses came out.  steak was great as usual here, never had a bad steak.  but, have to say, they must do something with the fries.  find a way to spice it up... the fries was just too plain.  

our app, bacon and scallop was pretty good as well... a bit on the small size but still very good.

we didn't have room for deserts unfortunately.  after eating, our waitress came over to ask and I actually said no to dessert.  our bill arrived within minutes and the damage for two was a little over a hundred dollars.  

I have to mention, I did pre-eat  a little before dinner, it was most likely why I said no to dessert.  lol

will I come back... yes!  and promise to take a little more time to eat next time."}
{"text":"Terrible. Came in for a surprise birthday party for my friend and instead got a surprise bad experience with the keg. I was treated with absolutely poor customer service. The food came and the order of all the food went to the wrong people.  I told the girl to put down the plate for my husband's seat and she totally ignored me and looked for instruction from the waiter instead. Then our separate bills came and he forgot to ring our bill because we were sitting at the end.  He also forgot to add the bills together. That's not the customer service I would expect at the Keg. Not to mention my sea bass was not fresh with old aspargus and the $16+ lobster tacos were actually 3 small lobster dusts in a taco."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. The prime rib is a very flavourful cut and I would strongly recommend it along with the mushroom neptune. The service however was terrible.  They used to not take reservations on the weekend, which is annoying but understandable considering how busy they are on the weekends, but now they don't take reservations on the weekdays within an hour of calling i.e. Calling at 7 to make a reservation at 7:45 is no longer allowed. This is blasphemy and I want to enjoy a nice meal but no longer can."}
{"text":"My wife and I managed to squeeze out 1.5 hours away from our baby and headed over for a quick steak dinner yesterday - Aug 12. 

Upon arrival at 5:50pm, we were greeted by the receptionist - a brown skin, dark long hair lady. We were rudely told that my reservation could not be found, her tone was so bad that it felt like it was my mistake that she could not find the reservation. \"What time is your reservation for?\" She asked, \"5:30\" I said. \"It is almost 6 now and we only hold tables for 15 minutes\", she replied with the same mono tone. OK, at that point, i thought i was not getting a table for the evening....then she turned around and told another receptionist standing next her \"take them to table 21\". What? so all that lecture on your customer and you actually have a table? But what pissed me off even more is that, once I walked in, the restaurant was next to empty!!! 

I later on brought this to the manager - Andrea, who was nice enough to comp us on derserts, and she also confirmed they were not busy that night, so they actually had tables on my arrival. Then again, why was the reception lady so mad!!??

I have been going to this Keg for a while, the food has been amazingly good and consistent, but this type of bad service at the reception was definitely uncalled for!!

{"text":"The keg has always been up to the standards. Not much to say but recommended for people looking for ribs and steaks in the area"}
{"text":"Just came here tonight for a celebration dinner. My friend and I had arrived on schedule at 6:30pm according to our booking time. Wow, unbelievably we were almost seated in about just one minute, no waiting time at all. I really couldn't wait to order my favorite dishes of one 10 oz. medium prime rib and escargot, and my friend ordered one 20 oz. medium rare rib steak instead of its traditional New York striploin steak. There was also a complimentary warm bread for us at the beginning of the meal. After we had finished the bread and a while later, the appetizer of escargot was served on the table right away. Then later on, our main course orders just came out on the table perfectly. They were so flavorful with nice presentation and delicious texture. Ultimately, I just finished everything on my dish, nothing left over at all... hehe. My favorite prime rib, it's so tender and just perfect for my dinner tonight..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, though a bit expensive. My friends tried the new York classic steak, fillet minion and ribs, while I tried the Thai chicken. Everything was excellent. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Their NY steak does not disappoint. As for desert, the Billie Miner Pie is a must try! Servers are very helpful and friendly. Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place, just check your bill before you pay. Was there last Feb they included some bar charges on our bill, i'm glad i was able to check first before paying"}
{"text":"I always go there.
Ever since the first time I went there, I wanted to go there again and again. 

Sure, their prices might be on the higher side, but in the end it's worth it. I ordered steak with a side of mashed potatoes and it was delicious. The tomatoes were a little over cooked but that's fine. Would recommend 9/10"}
{"text":"It was a great experience.
First time at The Keg .We went there with my family.The service is good and so is the food.
It was a Sunday so it was pretty crowded and we had to wait about an hour to be seated so we headed to the bar upstairs and had a Caesar and a beer. There were a couple of people having their meal at the bar too."}
{"text":"This is a review regarding the services during a recent visit. (the food was great as expected and reasonably priced). The excellent services began with the hostess, who made her best effort to put us in one comfy table (we went half an hour earlier, 2 booking of 4's initially); the waiter was very friendly and served the table in a quick and professional manner with great attention to small details (he checked on us frequently and filled up our drinks before it reached the bottom); they didn't include the gratitude in the bill, which took away the hard feeling of paying (in fact they received more because we were very satisfied with their services). We definitely will return soon!"}
{"text":"It was very busy and dark. The food was very tasty and had lots of flavour and pop to the food. I had the ribs it was good. I would come back next time"}
{"text":"Our server's name was CJ and he was spectacular. Decided to take my partner out to celebrate National Boyfriend Day! The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach... with a big ol' piece of steak! CJ was very accommodating and patient when taking our orders and delivering us our meals. He truly made our night with his impeccable customer service skills and friendliness. We hope he can continue to be our server. Oh yes... Hat's off to the chef for cooking up some yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"Had the prime rib and it was excellent and the new building is very nice."}
{"text":"I got a bone in rib eye cooked Pittsburg. Many places cannot pull off a perfect Pittsburg but they do. Pittsburg is very charred on the outside and how you want on the inside. I like mine rare. It came with tasty garlic mashed potatoes and an iceburg wedge salad. Normally I would not choose a wedge salad but the toppings made this one grwat. Good job guys."}
{"text":"The Keg is located at East Beaver Creek and is one of my favourite spots to go if I decide on eating somewhere a little more expensive. Since it's in EBC, make sure you reserve as you can end up waiting for an hour or more. And parking will always be troublesome so try coming earlier than your reservation because you can spend a ton of time looking for a spot. Not the venues fault though!

Their steaks are always tender and juicy, never had anything undercooked or not delicious as of yet. Their double baked potato is my favourite side that comes when you order, the mashed potatoes are good too though. 

Service is always top notch and the waiters are quite personal which is never a bad thing. Our waiter took a seat beside me when he was dealing with the bill with us. 

Good food for an expensive, but justified, price. Will definitely be back one day when I'm feeling rich haha! 4/5"}
{"text":"Jason the manager came out personally and took care of us when our medium well steak came out rare.  Waived the order from the bill which was nice.

This is a great steakhouse, better than many I have tried.  In terms of steakhouse, there are so many  really expensive ones in Toronto but some are just too expensive with their fancy meats.  This one is affordable at a reasonable pricing and top notch quality, it's a very well known franchise in Canada.

Steaks are always cooked to specification and they are always juicy and tender.  The double baked potato with bacon is a popular side to go with your steak.  If you're into seafood, there is always lobster tail and scallops to complement your steak.

Great dining atmosphere, not too dark and cozy.  It is located inside a plaza with tons of other restaurants. If you are staying at a hotel nearby, explore this plaza.  You will find more than 20 restaurants all within couple minutes of each other.

On weekends this place gets busy packed so make sure you have your reservation or else expect something like one hour wait."}
{"text":"I have to confess that to this day, I have yet to have a fantastic dining experience at ANY Keg.  Unfortunately, that streak continues after a dinner I attended on March 9, 2013.

To show I do not have a hate-on for the Keg, I will accentuate the positive.  The last time I had a steak at the Keg I had the s*its for a week.  That was about 10 years ago.  I finally broke down and ordered the 20oz. Rib Steak...medium rare of course.  I will give credit where credit is due.  The steak was EXCELLENT.  Cooked almost perfectly, and seasoned just right.  As for the rest of my meal, I ordered the garlic cheese toast as an appetizer and could not get enough of that one.  Very tasty.  The only negative was the side of Caesar Salad that came with my entree.  Yes, I realize it's a side dish, but when your salad taste worse than salad with Kraft Caesar dressing...then you should rethink the dressing!!  At least the cheese was GRATED.

Another positive was our server.  We had a table of nine adults and one child, which was the second table in a party that also included another 8 adults and two kids.  That's 17 adults and 3 children for those that are keeping score.  Not an easy job, to be sure, but our two servers were courteous, organized, non-intrusive and professional.  Definitely a credit to this particular KEG.  

Still another positive was the fact that when one of our party noticed that his steak was not MEDIUM RARE but MEDIUM, management immediately apologized and replaced the steak with another one, cooked this time to perfection.

The ambience and decor were excellent.  No complaints at all in that regard.

Now to the negatives.

It's not this Keg's fault, but finding parking in this restaurant area at dinner-time on a Saturday night is a crapshoot at best.  Combine that with mounds of unmelted snow/ice covering some spots, and you have yourself a parking task that would rival Yorkdale Mall on a normal day!  Confusing entrance-exit areas, drivers who don't know what the heck a roundabout is, much less how to navigate one, or two...you get the picture.

I can kind of live with the parking issues, since that's really out of a restaurant's control in that area of Richmond Hill.  The Keg can, however, control how their hosts/hostessess treat guests before they are seated.  

I don't care if half the party is late.  A host/hostess does not threaten to give away the tables if the remainder of the party doesn't show up within some arbitrary timeframe.  A host/hostess does NOT express frusration or annoyance in front of guests.  Yes, I understand it's busy and you're stressed, but you are the face of that restaurant and the first person guests interact with.  Even WalMart knows THAT!  If I was the one who made the reservation and that happened to me and my guests, I would have called the manager and walked right out.  Your food is good, but it isn't THAT good.  I get better treatment at a Chinese restaurant for Pete's sake.

So, long story short.  Food, wait staff and ambience - EXCELLENT;  Parking - brutal; Host/hostess - one of the worst I have experienced."}
{"text":"I find their price are high for the portions they serve. Food is mediocre but I wasn't full. Not paying $50 for a small steak a piece of lobster and shrimp and a coke again."}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought this would be another mediocre chain restaurant but this location was actually really good. The food was delicious, the service was great but slow because of how busy they are. The place was absolutely and apparently always packed so get a reservation. They are also very accommodating and professional; if there are any allergies, the manager will come and speak to you. My money was well spent here and I would recommend this location and come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good. Great serving sizes, diet friendly and large selection. Steak was cooked as ordered, as you'd expect from a steakhouse. I can't complain, everything was decent or better. 

Only downside is the service here. Extremely slow and you have to flag them down to get a refill. It wasn't that busy, so it was a bit annoying to have to keep asking. Nice server though, great attitude and personality. Although for a restaurant like this, you'd think they'd have more attentive servers. Tipped 20% regardless. Who knows, they could have been having a bad day, it's not me to judge."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and settings and very clean.  The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.

Went with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.

Steak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  

One of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.

The manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.

All in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it."}
{"text":"The best part about this place was the atmosphere.  A Tuesday night at 10pm, this place was packed.  Upbeat Music.  Good Scene.  But the food wasn't much better than Applebee's and the wine menu was poor.   I recommend for a group of people bc of the atmosphere, but if you're solo looking for a good meal, skip this place."}
{"text":"3 Stars mostly because of the service. I was here with my family celebrating 2 birthdays. Our server seemed very pushy on us to quickly order, as he came to ask us several times if we were ready, even after we told him give us a couple more minutes. Nothing he said was rude, but you could tell he did not care at all. The facial expressions he gave were just.. ugh. Go home if you don't want to work, right? Why work in a customer service job if you have such a stink attitude.

As for the food, everything was better than expected. Considering I was at a Milestones just the week before and ordered basically the same dishes, the dishes at the Keg were significantly better."}
{"text":"This location has been here for a while, went under renovations and still is a good choice, with friendly staff and good food.  Came here to celebrate a birthday with some friends and we really enjoyed the food and service.  Also, got a comp Billy Milners Pie for the bday boy and it was good.  A nice touch to a memorable night."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. Always that I want to have a good time for sure, this is the spot! The crab cakes, spinach and cheese dip and the steaks are amazing! Even the mint and chocolate candies! And warm bread!. The atmosphere is really nice and fair prices! Love it."}
{"text":"Best Steak ever tasted in Canada. I ordered Well Done, maybe it was left a bit on the grill and it was burnt a bit. I will definitely be more careful next time."}
{"text":"My family and I decided last minute to have dinner at The Keg. We were situated pretty close to this location so made a reservation online in the next fifteen minutes. The Host greeted us promptly and no issues with the last minute electronic reservation.  Our waiter was friendly and personable, and interacted with everyone at the table, even Grandma who doesn't speak English. 

One of our dishes came out too overcooked and we just gave the feedback as a comment, and did not intend to get anything out of the remark, however our waiter expressed his apologies and had the Manager come out to apologize as well. The Manager generously made some arrangements and overall exceeded our expectations on how he dealt with the situation. 

For this particular occasion, we really appreciated the team's attentiveness and ability to know how to maintain and please customers."}
{"text":"Came here for friend's birthday. The restaurant is busy on a Sunday 6pm but I'm sure they have enough staffs on floor. However, the service isn't that good as the food takes very long to come and it takes quite awhile for our server to come and take our orders. The food also is just alright. I ordered their feature of the day which said it's a cab sirloin, and I was told it's supposed to be more marble than top sirloin but I don't think it's marble at all. Another friend of mine had a Prime steak and that one is more tender and juicer but still not so good as it doesn't taste like a steak but just a piece of meat. However, the dessert I had which is a mocha icecream cake, and that is actually not bad. Overall, I may not come here for steak but maybe try their burger instead? Or maybe I just had a bad piece of steak and the kitchen is too busy to maintain the quality of the meals??"}
{"text":"The Keg is not a fancy dress that'll turn heads and attract cat calls. It's more of an old sweatshirt you wanna wear when you want to be predictably comfortable. It's my go to place when I want a reliable prime rib or steak. The wait staff have low turnover (according to insider sources) and you can tell that they all have experience and confidence in what they're doing. Freshly baked bread, med rare prime rib cooked perfect every time, makes this a safe and delicious choice."}
{"text":"The keg is a steakhouse chain for steak dinner if you're not too picky. No complains about that!

-I never had a bad experience at any of the keg locations. 
-Don't think the prices are unfair.. you get what you pay for!
-Generally good service and friendly staff.
-Difficult to find parking as per usual during prime dinner hours.


Recommendation: book a table ahead of time. Don't be a dumb dumb and expect a table at 8pm on Saturday night with no reso. ;)

Good low key birthday spot as they're very generous with their complimentary birthday desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious steaks, great wine and a comfortable atmosphere.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that the server was somewhat inattentive.  Would highly recommend for a business dinner or special event."}
{"text":"Great Service, great food, great people! Go every occasion and you won't regret it! You must try the top Sirloin! It's a must try in town !!! 

Every penny is worthy!

Go for your special occasion and you will get free deserts!"}
{"text":"The keg is always reliable and always has great steak.  Usually seated quickly even in busy days."}
{"text":"We went to Keg to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. Everything that we had ordered was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I love the layout and atmosphere of this place. My husband and I both got the Bleu Cheese Filet, and it was delicious! The flavors were so succulent that I was upset when it was gone! The way all of the flavors worked together, it was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had. My son got the mini burgers and loved them. My only complaint is really slow service, we had to wait for 30 minutes between the appetizers and the main course - I think they just forgot about us :-)"}
{"text":"I think this place a little bit pricey, but the food was not bad.  I waited for a while for my friends to arrive.  The seats are cozy, and comfortable.  The lighting was a little dim which is not great for taking picture.  

Coincidentally, couple of friends of mine all ordered the 8 ounces top sirloin.  The iceberg lettuce with bluecheese sauce was really aromatic and nutty.  My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection with double baked potatoes with velvety texture.  

The server was also quite friendly, and we srayed for a bit for drink after we finished dinner.  So it was a pretty good dinner experience."}
{"text":"It's an heaven for meat lovers! Vey delicious ribs and steaks. If you haven't been here, you have missed live."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this location. Really enjoy the fillet cut. Service has always been good and the one problem I had was resolved with free dessert and 20% discount."}
{"text":"I would go here just for the French onion soup which many restaurants don't offer anymore. The place has a classy atmosphere yet you can be as casual as you want. The steak and seafood is done to perfection. Places like this I am confident ordering a steak rare because they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I always come here for special occasion with the family. I've been to other locations but it doesn't beat the incredible service at this location. I recently went back for Father's day and my steak came out a little too charred but they immediately dealt with it and the manager himself made a new steak for me. It came out to perfection, and very flavourful. Much like its franchise, the atmosphere is business casual and a great place for a nice steak. I highly recommend this location if you want great service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening around 5:30 p.m.; the place got pretty full around 6:00 p.m., so it may be beneficial to have a reservation in place. 

The complimentary bread at The Keg has always been my favourite - it is quite possibly the softest bread that I have tasted; coupled with the freshness and warmth from the bread, it serves as a perfect vehicle to hold and melt the butter. It was absolutely delicious!

MAIN: Arctic Char

While the salmon itself was very moist and well-seasoned, the overall dish was extremely oily. As a result of the oil, my throat began to feel rather uncomfortable, immediately drinking four cups of water to help soothe the discomfort. The blistered tomatoes were also quite sour. I personally would not recommend this dish or order it again. 

SERVICE: Acceptable

I've been to the Richmond Hill Keg on multiple occasions, but this has been the first time where I have left rather dissatisfied with the service. The server was quite frankly, rude, when I mentioned that in the past, I would have a tilapia-based dish and that it was no longer on the menu. He abruptly asked how long ago I had eaten at The Keg, to which I responded last year. In response, he chuckled and said (and I paraphrase), \"No way - we definitely didn't have that dish.\" One of my friends that I was eating with agreed that his tone and demeanor was both condescending and disrespectful. While I did not appreciate that encounter, our server did visit our table often to fill up our waters."}
{"text":"Arrived later after work with a party of 5. Drinks were nice and the insides of the restaurant was much nicer than we had expected in the area. 
After Shore60, Saint and other Toronoto highpoints we were pleasantly surprised to find a place in RichmondHill that was tasteful and tasty.
Good food had by all. 
I had my heart set on prime rib, but they only had medium well done. More like well done. Good meat but was not optimal. Will have to try later.
Others in the group tried Filet, peppercorn steak, rib eye king crab to good effect.

Compared to expectations, Keg exceeded ours."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The Keg isn't usually my first pick for a steakhouse;  however, this past year I've found myself coming back either for a friend's birthday dinner or just a outing with my coworkers. Recently, I received a gift card so I decided to treat myself to a Wednesday night dinner at the Keg +1! First off, I was very impressed with the service we received despite how busy the restaurant was. Every table was full and if you didn't make reservations, you were waiting for a good 30 minutes. Luckily, we made reservations for 8:30 PM and it was still packed! 

Our waiter was very funny, enjoyable and easy to find. He came to our table at the right times and would even have a small chat. The food was delicious too -- I ordered the Top Sirloin Classic which came with a salad and a side. The salad portion was HUGE. My other guest ordered the Sirloin Oscar and that was also quite good. The topping to our meal, however, was the Mushrooms Neptune. That appetizer is, honestly, the best dish they could ever serve. It's mushrooms with crab and while that may sound simple, the flavours and gooey ness of it was to die for. I would highly recommend that and the baked Brie. ;) 

We also got a creme brûlée for dessert and it was shareable between 2 people! I'd definitely return to this location. :)"}
{"text":"filet was amazing though it was over cooked a little bit. Italian wine tastes good. The appetizer with avocado is really really good."}
{"text":"Easily the worst experience I've ever had at a Keg which usually guarantees good service and solid food.  First the food.  I ordered their special, a 18 ounce bone in strip loin, medium rare, for $39.  The steak was way undercooked, I'm not even sure I'd consider it rare, closer to blue.  Like most keg steaks it was in desperate need of salt which usually isn't a big deal when it's cooked properly, but the combination of the two made the steak nearly unpalatable.  Unsalted, practically raw steak, is unacceptable.  As for the service, it was about as basic and lacking in personality as one could expect without it being bad.  

We've visited this location and have been pleased before, but I doubt we'll return.  The Keg's food isn't spectacular enough on its best day to overlook such a poor outing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Keg location. The food here is always amazing, the staff is friendly and their service is top notch. I always get the steak, lobster, and baked potato with the 3 cheese butter and sour cream. It is always delicious ! The drinks are great too, the sangria and peach bellini are my two favourites. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. I love the environment, the service, and the food is always consistent & really good. Both times I've ordered steaks, they were cooked perfectly. Definitely a great place to go on a date or to take friends or customers on a business outing."}
{"text":"The steaks here have a great taste, meals and dishes come in perfect portions. The staff are extremely nice and welcoming, and are there whenever you need something. Only downside was that my cauliflower mash was cold and they needed to fire a new one."}
{"text":"Coworker and I sat down and warned the server that we like a lot of water.  I guess it just went in one ear and out the other.  My water was refilled once and it was empty for 3/4 of my dinner.  I even saw the server pour water for the table across the aisle and I made eye contact with him.  He came and bused my plate by never refilled my water.  I even asked while busing my plate to refill my water.

Servers don't have control of a lot, but refills are one of them.  We talked to the manager on duty on the way out.

Dinner was fine, presentation and execution was good,  It was served in a timely manner and the dishes came out correct."}
{"text":"Ordered the 10 oz prime rib. It was tender and delicious. It had a lot of flavor, so I didn't even need the sauce that went with it. The twice baked potato was real good. Our server was nice but probably could have been quicker on checking on us. We ran out of water and had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Decided on this place from somebody we know that lived near hear that we know.
Great place!
Nice atmosphere and food was just all perfect.
Orders rib steak which is a ribeye in the states.
Twice baked potato was delicious. 
Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been back to the keg...probably like 6 years since I don't live in Canada anymore, but have fond memories of this place.

Anyways, the staff here is nice except for an incident we had just this last time but I won't let one waiter ruin my childhood memories of this place!

Anyways the steaks here now that I live in LA are maybe okay to me ...the teriyaki one is my favorite since it was also so different ! 

What we really come here for surprisingly are the appetizers for the most part !!! Haha I know it's a steakhouse but they can also cook other great food (which is great)

Served nice warm bread

Baked garlic shrimp (4) - all 7 of us ordered this and everytime I used to come no one shares haha or they get 2 per person 

Baked goat cheese (5) - once upon a longggggg time ago this was the first time I ate goat cheese & fell in love ...ever since I've been in obsessed with cheese!

Lobster gratinee (4.5) - mmm in season! Lobster summer perfect timing this was marinated really well!

Escargot - my brother used to really enjoy this

French onion soup (5) - who doesn't have a french onion soup at a steakhouse ...this was also a fav!

Keg caesar - great classic

Teriyaki classic (4)- I love the glaze on this steak it's soo tasty & the mashed potatoes make it a perfect combo

Filet migno (3.5) - I've had better, the last time it wasn't cooked properly -__-

Lychee martini (5) - sooo yummy with fresh lychees !!! 

Overall still love this place ... Great joint!"}
{"text":"Always good food and good service.  They are very consistent in these two areas.   Filet mignon is always my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because of the great service I got from one of your servers named Nick. We told Nick that we've never been to The Keg ever and he made sure that we enjoy our first experience in their restaurant. He didn't seem to mind that we ordered an appetizer and shared a main course (decided to order a 12 ounce steak with sides of seafood). He even made a recommendation that we get the New York steak instead...which we did of course because he seemed like he knew what he was talking about. He was very nice and friendly and our food came out faster than we expected. He always came around to check with us, top our glass of water. He was such a great server! In the end, we were so full of everything we ate...so my boyfriend jokingly told him that he brought me there for dessert but we're too full to even have it. Next thing you know...he brings out a big slice of ice cream cake for the both of use and tells us it's on him!  We were so shocked by this sweet gesture (and we were also very full) but we tried our best to eat as much of it as we can. It was such a sweet gesture. Never had a server provide this kind of service in my life. And the best part is, the cake was actually delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic experience at this Keg. My group was greeted by the hostess immediately upon entering. She was very polite and just what I expected at this location. Cutting it short, we all ordered a rib steak dinner that was probably the best that I have tasted in a long time. Like my last experience, my steak was a little under cooked. I asked for medium rare but it came out to be rare. I spoke to my server and the manager (Andrew) quickly came over to apologize for the mishap. In fact, my cousin's steak was also under cooked, so he was extra apologetic about it. It was no big deal to the both of us - we just wanted to finish our food, so heating it up would have sufficed. But Andrew went beyond what was required and brought us both a brand new meal with all the sides filled. The steaks were medium to medium rare the second try and it was absolutely delicious. My friend's steak was made to perfection, except he still had tin foil on the bottom of it. We notified Andrew again, so something like this won't happen to someone else that's not as forgiving. Like I said earlier, we didn't mind any of it - we just wanted to finish our dinner. Andrew was clearly worried about our experience that evening, as he came back a few times after  to ask what else we wanted. We just responded by saying, \"we're ok Andrew, don't worry about it\".

So by the end of the night when our stomachs were full and ready to leave, our server handed us a dessert menu and said, \"if you guys are interested in dessert, let me know... And it's on us\". Originally I wanted to say no because I was so full. But as a Yelper and major foodie, I decided to take up the offer. I ordered the brownie fudge sundae and it was the most mouthwatering and flavourful dessert I have had in quite a while. It was a simple dessert, but they made it in such a way that I could not resist. 

Great job, team Keg! Keep up the professionalism and great service. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on Monday for my birthday and I just had the most wonderful service. Started with the young man at the front who brought us to our table. We asked him if we could get a booth instead because we had our daughter's car seat. He took care of us right away and sat us at a booth table. I wish we found out his name because he was so courteous and professional. Next, our server was amazing. She was so friendly and took care of everything for us. She even brought some carrots and celery for my daughter to chew on! I felt so happy. We really appreciated the gesture. I never had such an experience from this location. Usually we only came because it was close to where we live but now, will definitely be coming back for the service!!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant chain. This location has a large bar area that's more lounge than bar. Waits for seating can be in the 30-45 minute range most evenings, but it's worth it. Comfortable seating, knowledgeable staff. And the steaks are AWESOME. Enough said."}
{"text":"Am here today (Monday - end of the long weekend). It's actually kind of busy here today and we got seated pretty fast. The greeter greeted us and seated us at our seat within 5min. Then our waiter came his name I believe is Joel. Very nice guy and super attentive to us. We ordered the lobster tacos from the summer special ($19) and the Steak&Lobster entree for him and New York strip for me. Came out efficiently and to perfection. Great service, A+ food and friendly servers. I would come back again and I highly recommend the steak here."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday and it was okay. Prime rib was pretty good and juicy. I got mixed veggies but these were sooooo bland and did not taste good. For $29 I would expect the side to be as good as the main. The bread was very good and hot, went well with our meal. 

Since it was a birthday they gave us a very generous slice of their ice cream cake which was nice of them!"}
{"text":"The service was above and beyond! Food is pretty standard steakhouse fare. (Maybe a bit above average. Would recommend the French onion soup.) But our server was super nice and thoughtful. Two of our steaks were too salty and our server got us new ones and the manager also came to talk with us to make sure everything was good. Truly excellent service."}
{"text":"The Keg is so overrated. Went for a few drinks and apps last night, I'm over this restaurant. First they wanted to charge for a Keg sized vodka soda when we only received a single shot. Had the waitress change bill. All their apps are the same and deteriorating. Calamari over fried, over breaded and too expensive. Bacon scallops yada yada yada. 
It's all shit, but their \"brand\" is still bringing in the idiots who think this is good food. 
F**k them."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and got seated in less than 5 mins. The waitress was so nice and cheerful even though it was crazy busy (I would've been exhausted). The food came quick which. We ordered French onion soup (which I never had but was really good) and the garlic cheese toast as appetizers. The kids had burgers/chicken fingers and fries which came with fruit and ice cream (they looked satisfied). For mains we got blackened sea bass with side of asparagus/quinoa which was really good. I had filet mignon with mash, mushrooms and Caesar salad. Bam... I forgot to actually post this so its a little late but still was Boss!"}
{"text":"The best birthday freebie is here, which is their ice cream cake, absolutely delicious.

KEG is a reliable steakhouse chain. Always dependable for top service, professional staff, and good food. Go here when you got some spare cash to spare as what you order (app, entree, dessert) can add up.

Along with steaks, they have great lobster tails although expensive and I love the stuffed chicken supreme. Their twice baked potato and fries are yummy too. Also enjoyed their complimentary fresh bread. Very busy. Usually always a line up during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Every meal is always the exact same. It's nice to know you're getting exactly what you expect. When I had an issue the last time I was here, they comped my entire meal. Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"This location has the BEST Prime Rib! it melts in my mouth! and I keep coming back for more! I tried other steakhouses even paying more then what the Keg charges and it still doesn't compare. The only thing is that the line ups are LONG, every single night! regardless if it is monday or friday! grab a drink at the bar and wait it out."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night, place was packed after 7:00pm! The restaurant doesn't take reservations during peak hours, so you have to check in with the host and they give you a tracker. Wait was ~45 mins. at 6:30pm on a Saturday.

Service: Waiters are attentive, and service is standard for a steakhouse. They'll walk you through the menu if it's your first time there. 

Food: Complimentary bread was fresh out of the oven, with whipped butter - perfection. Had the New York Strip, was cooked to my preference (medium-rare). Twice-baked potato was delicious, crispy with bacon bits on top - highly recommended! A very filling meal, and what you can expect from a steakhouse chain (nothing mind-blowing, but up to fairly high standards).

Overall: Great first experience at The Keg, and would definitely return if I felt like I wanted some nice steak!"}
{"text":"The wait time for this keg is ridiculous. They don't accept reservations and had to wait a little over an hour and a half to be seated. Better off going to the other keg locations. Anywhere but this one. Food is the same elsewhere and you won't have to wait so long. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Making reservations was a breeze for the Keg through Open Table. We were seated right away! It really surprised me how quickly the Keg filled up and how busy it already was before 6pm.

Coming here with my family, we asked for warm water and were glad how greatly the accommodated us with 3 cups of not steaming hot, but warm enough to drink water. We decided to share the Mushrooms Neptune $11, the 10oz prime rib with the twice baked potato $31 and the Surf and Turf which included a 3oz lobster tail, two fillet steaks, 5 pieces of asparagus and a small salad for $29. 

We were served instantly with warm bread and butter, delicious, but be careful cause it's really hot. I think I would appreciate it if the bread was cut fully into four or eight separate slices instead of us having to rip it apart.

The food came really fast, after we had the bread, the food came in about 5 minutes! It came all at once too, just as we asked!

Let's start off with the Mushrooms Neptune. The mushrooms were placed in a cute little palette with a cheese mixed with crab meat stuffed on top. Furthermore, they had two slices of hot sweet bread on the side for the extra cheese - delicious!

The surf and turf, I thought was a little overpriced because it was a smaller dish, even though it had a delicious lobster. The lobster was a little salty to my preference - I know it had a lot of seafood taste.

The star of the show - the prime rib was DELICOIUS. Cooked to perfection with no juice oozing out right when we cut it. Tender and soft to chew on. Bonus points for the fried onions and the twice baked potato with delicious bacon bits inside!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and booked earlier as this location tends to be really busy. Service was pretty good with servers pouring water when we arrived plus went over the specials. A few of us decided on steak while only one had seafood.

For some reason, the seared tuna was the best. All of us with steak were disappointed in the quality of the steak. I ordered the prime rib steak meal cooked rare. It was not outstanding and Some parts were tough to eat. Not sure if I would return for food but drinks and dessert are nice for the venue."}
{"text":"Great for a working dinner.   The bar area layout has a mix of high tables, comfy bar stools and regular tables.  It was enough atmosphere to not feel stuffy, but enough ambiance to know you were in a good spot for food.  They had a jumbo flat screen and Wi-Fi to get work done.  I ordered steak and lobster and it was fantastic.  The steak was seasoned well, the lobster tail was fresh, sweet and needed no butter or additives.  I got asparagus as a side and it was grilled to perfection.  The steak was a great cut and cooked as requested.  The staff in this area were friendly and attentive without being pushy.  When you have to work late, or eat by yourself and you want to add some fanciness this is a good place to be.

With the summer special going on the price was right too.  I wish we had one of these places in the States."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with Chris and the Keg Steakhouse in Richmond Hill.

I called the restaurant at 10:20pm today, I spoke to Chris, asked him what time they will close today? He said 11 and asked me if I wanted to dine in, I said I will order some takeout instead and I'll call him when I get it the car which is about 15 mins later, he said ok.

I got ready and got in the car and I called the Keg Restaurant again at 10:36pm and no one picked up the phone.

I called 7 times, and it keeps going to their voicemail.

Then I arrived at the restaurant at 10:53pm and the front doors were closed.

I saw a waiter and I waved to her to open the door for me, and asked for Chris.

He came and apologized and said they are closed now, I explained to him that he said they close at 11, he said kitchen closes at 10:30 and the restaurant closes at 11, I asked him why he didn't say this to me on the phone when I spoke to him because all he said is the restaurant closes at 11pm.

He didn't know what to say obviously because he knows he screwed up.

He said all the grills have already been turned off.

I left the restaurant very upset in a very bad mood, and advised him that I will be posting my complaint on Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google Business, Zomatoe, Yellow Pages, and other review sites, he said ok, and this is what I am doing now.

I don't trust this restaurant, they don't go by their word, they made drive all the way there for nothing, they don't have about their customers."}
{"text":"Craving steak? The Keg has never been a disappointment and the service here is always fantastic. It doesn't matter what day you come, it's always busy so be prepared for a wait. We always hang out at the bar while waiting for a table and service there was also very good. We ordered the New York Peppercorn steak and it was made perfect (medium). The apps - calamari and neptune mushroom were okay, I'd pass next time. French onion soup was super good - cheesey and tasty without being super salty. 

Tip: I didn't try making a reservation but wonder if they take reservations during the week. You may want to try and save yourself the wait."}
{"text":"I rarely eat meat but when I do, you can bet it's a filet mignon at The Keg! This location never disappoints and always offers consistent quality food and service. The steaks are always cooked to the right doneness and if you get toppings on your steaks, they are always plentiful and flavourful. If you like tequila, you must try their tequila cocktails. They are absolutely wonderful and the tequila taste really came through. However, I got one that was supposed to have a ginger flavour but I couldn't taste the ginger at all. Just tequila... still divine but just not what was advertised. Will be back again and again. Bonus: they give you a complimentary Billy Miner cake with a candle if they know that you are celebrating a birthday there."}
{"text":"Be sure to come early, especially if it is Valentine's Day. We came at about 430, and were seated promptly. The organization has one person take you to your seat, another take your order (in the apron) and another serve your main. By observation, the majority congregate at the bar the majority of the time while the staff in the aprons do the bulk of the heavy lifting. Not sure why this is the organization: but if it works, don't fix it. 

The food is quite good; we have been here many times. The top sirloin Chicago style and the Prime Rib are sure things, and the burger is also a good choice. Be careful though, you can't help but feel that bloating sensation before you get the bill! Service is good and attentive, good experience once per year."}
{"text":"Solid steak as expected! I love the fact they don't sacrifice the quality for quantity here in Canada. If this steak was in the US, it would be twice the size and taste 1/2 as good. The hostess was super nice and we had a really cute friendly waitress who was very knowledgeable regarding he menu! I had a side caeser salad with garlic mashed potatoes...again really good. Looking fwd to coming back!"}
{"text":"Keg is consistent.  Lets give it that.  You order your steak and it will come exactly as cooked.  Basically ever time you go is a photocopy of the previous time.
Lets talk about another consistent thing with the keg and especially this one.  Consistency of wait time of 60-120 minutes.  I have never come here on a weekend and not had to wait.  Why not take reservations?  Take half reservations and half walk in?  It would work.  
Sometimes I think people in upper management have disorders of the brain.  Do they actually think things out or just do things like this as a joke?
Anyways, I like Keg.  The double baked is a must.  Get the shrimp in the escargot thing with the chalah bread dip.  And my all time favorite.  The billy minor pie.  When I die I would like to be buried with Billy minor.  It is my all time favorite dessert.  My first time having the Billy Minor was better than the first time my hand touched a pair of juicy meat puppets."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambience in this place, but beware: the dimly lit atmosphere, plus the meat & potatoes, may make you sleepy! My friend and I both felt kinda tired while we were in there, but as soon as the night air hit us, we were completely refreshed. Strange! I liken the atmosphere to that of P.F. Chang's.

The food at The Keg was great. I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare, and it arrived fully rare. When I commented to the server, she defended it, saying that was their ideal house medium rare (note: you may want to order medium to actually get medium rare). I sucked it up (literally!) and ate it rare, for fear it would come back overdone. It was still quite delicious, served au jus and with horseradish on the side. The sautéed button mushrooms were the bomb! The Wedge salad was delicious too. My friend loved his steak as well. Can't vouch for the drinks tho, as we didn't partake of the beverages this night. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The bar menu's sliders are always good.  However, don't order the sirloin steak on the kid's menu for your kid.  The 6oz sirloin was chewy and tasteless.  Even though it is only $13.5, it is not even worth $5.  Don't order it!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and it's been consistent all around. 
We usually just come for celebration so it's maybe a once a year thing 

They don't take reservations on weekend nights, but I'm not sure about weekdays and I'm not sure about online Open Table. I haven't ever really had to wait all that long though so maybe I've just been pretty lucky. 

Service here has always been average. The food is delicious. Our steak has always been cooked exactly has we like it. There was one time that just the outer side was a bit burnt, and the server immediately made sure he got us another one. I always end up getting the prime rib just because it's always cooked well, it's soft, and delicious with horse radish. They also serve these little fried onions on the side and some grilled veggies. I get the smaller size option and it's more than enough :) 

Make sure to try one of their drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome keg.. Always good, even with my own money!"}
{"text":"Besides the front desk Staff and their lack of reservations,  this is the greatest restaurant in both quality of food, service, atmosphere, and timeliness."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night for dinner, arriving 20 minutes before our reservation but seated promptly. This was my first time here. Our server Julie was friendly and helpful. I ordered a New York steak and from recommendations on Yelp, my girlfriend ordered a prime rib. We both had the twice baked potato as our sides.

The meal starts with nice warm bread and butter. And the steaks came quickly afterwards. My NY steak was great, seasoned well and cooked to a nice crust on the outside and medium rare on the inside. It was seasoned well. The prime rib was also great, came with some fried onions and horseradish. The prime rib was tender but not as flavourful so both of us actually preferred the NY. The potato is awesome.

We also got the Billy Miner Pie which was amazing. It really is more of an ice cream cake and we had a quick chat with our server about the origin of its name which was fun. A must try. Overall a very nice meal, but getting on the pricier side, ~$35 per meal."}
{"text":"The Keg for the most part has been a great experience for our family. Recently we have been going to the Richmond Hill location on York Boulevard. Like many of the reviews, the service and food quality is up to par.

Given my parents are seniors and we booked for 5PM dinner on Friday there was no wait in getting a table. On this visit and previous visits we have had excellent service. The sirloin and lobster were very good as was the lamb (three prongs) special.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable."}
{"text":"I wanted something which I know would not disappoint and the first thing that came to mind was The Keg. I always find my experience at The Keg to very consistently good. 

The meals starts off with complementary bread. Love the soft butter that comes with it.

To start things off we got the baked brie for $11. You get a whole block of brie cheese, pesto sweet jelly and little miniature bread slices. When you combine all these ingredients into one bite its just perfection. There was not enough miniature bread for all the toppings but luckily we didn't finish our complimentary bread so we slathered the rest of it on, not wasting the slightest bit. 

For my main I got the 14oz prime rib for $32. Super soft and tender. Came with onion fritters and baked potato. I ordered the bake potato with everything on it, but it only came with butter. A huge let down for me but this was the only fault of the night. A baked potato is just not the same if you don't have the sour cream, cheese, bacon bits and tiny chopped onions on it. 

My guest got the lobster/shrimp roll for $19. Came with side coleslaw and fries. The shrimp to lobster ratio was like 80% shrimp and 20% lobster. Tasted okay at best. 

Dessert is always a must for me. The waiter doesn't even have to ask me for dessert. Its always the other way around. I'm the one asking the waiter what they have for dessert. 

Got the creme brulee $7. The largest serving of creme brulee I have ever seen. I liked how there was a nice thick layer of hardened caramelized sugar on top. Tasted amazing.

Also got the cherry cheese cake $7. It tasted great but I have tried so many different cheese cakes that it made this one taste pretty average. Still very good though. 

It was an expensive meal for two but if its at The Keg then I know its gonna be worth it."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but mostly worth the money.

Restaurant was crowded, even though it was a Monday night. Luckily, I reserved a table.

The service was great. I ordered the Top Sirloin, which was alright. 

I got a complimentary Billy Miner Pie slice, as it was my birthday."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of dining out at company restaurants but in the Toronto area, when you are travelling with folks who won't eat at any of the plethora of outstanding Asian restaurants in this area, I'd say the Keg is a trusted and reliable stand by.    I ordered the prime rib, which is the best value on their menu, and consistently superb.   Temperature (med. rare) was perfect and very flavorful.  Their fresh hot bread is awesome and a huge temptation to finish, even though I didn't.  The weak point is the wine selections and pricing.  Very mediocre wine at typical Canadian huge prices.   I have to travel alone to Toronto next time and rate some great Asian fare.  Until then, thanks Keg for a great prime rib!"}
{"text":"I came on a sat night. Called 2 days in advance for a reservation however was told they don't take reservation after 5. Also asked how much was to open a bottle of wine, the customer service rep didn't know the answer to that question.... for a steak house restaurant I would expect them to know.


Anyhow we showed up at 7, and was told the way is 1 hour 15mins. We saw a lot of ppl and I didn't expect this location to be that popular but that was my part on my side. How ever we did wait since it was a farewell party and my party really wanted steak. The wait ended up to be roughly 1 hour... I guess 15mins faster? Haha but I most likely won't go back for dinner"}
{"text":"Honestly I thought I made a huge mistake coming on st.patty night. There was a huge line up but didn't actually have to wait too long since it was just a party of 2. The place is packed but noise level is pretty average so it wasn't too bad an ambience. The server was really nice and attentive. Didn't have to wait or wave my hand like a maniac for her to notice me. 

Ordered: 
Top sirloin steak with green salad and fries (6oz): I usually can't take my meat unless it's like medium well. Call me crazy but can't help it. Surprisingly the meat was still tender even though my friend stared at me like I was crazy... it also came with veggies on the side (beans and mushrooms). Very well marinated and seasoned. Though I'd probably recommend to stay away from the green salad. It was almost perfect except it had no taste but lots of olive oil. The portions were pretty good. Or maybe it's because I have a small stomach but I wasn't able to finish my salad or fries."}
{"text":"Food is great, service sucks. Came on a Wednesday night, super busy 30-45 minute wait for 1 person. Offered me the bar but no opening. Hostess could barely comprehend my name. When I finally was seated I was
Put in the back in the corner to be forgotten about. I've been to the Keg all over Canada and the US and this is the worst experience bar none. I wouldn't suggest ever coming to this location unless you are a huge party as that's mainly what they cater to."}
{"text":"Steak done right.  

I was amazed by the colorful veggies on my plate.  

The Keg is fairly standard fare and you come here to get what you expect.  To quote another reviewer \"I wanted something which I know would not disappoint...\"  Keg, you have delivered."}
{"text":"Went to the other Keg house, order the Blue Cheese Fillet.
as good as it gets for a steak :)

can't go wrong going to this place, only you might need reservation if you have more than 2 people in your party.
this place pack."}
{"text":"The Kegs a keg a keg, a keg.  Steakhouse chain with very good food.  This particular location service was eager and willing.  Food was very good.  I rarely eat at the Keg when I'm home, more likely when I travel for business.  The food was very good, the filet wrapped in bacon was very good, food was hot and service was excellent.  I guess that's why I keep going back when I'm away from home :)"}
{"text":"The Keg has always been a staple in our household (especially this location), so I chose to come here last weekend to celebrate my 30th birthday. Let me summarize by saying that overall, it was a major disappointment.

Firstly, I tried making reservations for my party of 6 but the restaurant does not take them for Saturday nights, so it would be on a first come first serve basis. My parents had arrived with my grandparents first and after a bit of a wait, they were seated in a round booth that was meant for 4 people. The hostess put an additional 2 high chairs for me and my wife. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was that our chairs somewhat impeded traffic, making our seats very uncomfortable. Secondly, it was clear that the table was too small for 6 entrees. This was proven to be true throughout the night as we had to battle with maneuvering numerous hot plates around. We decided not to make a fuss over the seating because it was busy and because I did not want to nitpick over small things on my birthday.

Our server, I have to say, was excellent. She had a great attitude and made different recommendations for my family members which was definitely appreciated. The appetizers were decent as well: we got the bacon wrapped scallops and the calamari like we always do. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.

My father and my wife ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon. I had the Oscar sirloin. Our steak entrees were all more or less okay -- not the greatest I've had at The Keg but not anything to complain about. However, my mother and my grandmother both ordered the lobster dinner, which was incredibly, and I mean unacceptably, salty. I thought my mother was exaggerating until I tried her lobster myself. We then spoke to the server about it and she was extremely nice and had the lobsters replaced. However, the replacement lobsters came out just as over-salted, and as many would know, seniors have a tough time eating heavily salted food. Eventually, the manager came to explain that it may just be the batch of lobsters they received that have the salty taste. We did not complain further or ask anything to be comped, mostly because I did not want to cause a ruckus on my 30th birthday, and because our server was incredibly nice (thankful for that).

All in all, I was hugely disappointed with the food quality. It was subpar and somewhat ruined what was to be a great night. The Keg definitely fell short of what it has been to my family in the past, and I think it is safe to say that we will not return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Thought it was just one ordinary chain restaurant experience.  But what a pleasant surprise. The baseball steak is the best.  So was the coffee cheesecake. Great wine selection too.  Long wait though."}
{"text":"Same good taste and service you can expect from a well run franchise. I come here for drinks often and their evening happy hour specials are very good! $5 Caesars, $5 pints, $6 wine, etc. They make really good drinks overall!

This keg also has great nachos. I like how the dips are served in tortilla chip bowls. 

They get extremely busy on weekends so watch out. I don't think they take reservations on weekend evenings either after a certain time so heads up."}
{"text":"Pros:
Large seating area
Great bang for your buck value

Cons:
Wait times can very

The keg to me has always been a place where you can get a good steak without completely breaking the bank.  Dinner for 2 here will be about $80-$120 depending on how many apps and drinks you order.  While you can always have a better steak at places like Jacobs, you'll be spending about half what you would spend at the higher end places.

We came in on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I had called ahead of time to see what they wait time would be.  The server on the line said about 30 minutes. Out wait time ended up being about 15 minutes.  There have been times where wait times can be over an hour.  I just go somewhere else on days like that.  The wait times vary so much it's mostly a game of chance.

My favourite steak by far is the rib steak.  The keg is one of the few non-high end places that gives you a nice bone in one.  Most other places like the keg will not have the bone still attached to the steak.  If you know your steak, you know grilling it with the bone in makes for a much better steak.  A 20 ounce rib steak will set you back $40 here.  It's by far the best bang for your buck steak in town if you ask me.  My wife ordered the strip loin which was pretty good as well.  She would of liked it to be a little less lean though.

All in all, I have never had a bad experience at this Keg location.  Service has always been good even on busier days.  They have kids meal options which is great for my kids. The keg will never be the place to have the best steak, but if you want a great steak at a fraction of the price, it's my go to."}
{"text":"After spending the weekend in the east coast, my boyfriend and I were aching for some steak. We were going to try a different steak house but shied away because we wanted it done right; no trial runs. You can't go wrong with The Keg. Expectations are always met. 

We were situated on the patio behind a glass window waterfall. In all my Keg experiences, this was unique to this location. It's amazing how many people touch the window, myself included. As we enjoyed our meal, there must have been about 5 people walk by just to put their hands on the glass to touch the water. 

Our server was very friendly and kind. She engaged in conversation and genuinely seemed interested in our recent vacation. 

Food was perfection, as always.

The only thing I can think of that was a negative was the number of wasps on the patio. I totally get this is beyond the Keg and more of a nature thing... and the fact that I had wine didn't help the situation. They would be attracted to the food, fly into the water wall and hang out until they dried off. It kept me on my toes, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is my fav chain of the Keg in the GTA for Prime Rib, and I have been to locations in Brampton, Mississauga and Toronto, having previously lived in those cities.

The lighting in this location is pretty dimly lit, as it is with all the other Kegs'. I am not a fan of it, as it personally makes me feel sleepy/lethargic while I wait for my meal, but the food definitely makes up for it.

I asked for medium and the Prime Rib was done medium, just perfectly! I find that with other locations, my steak always comes back medium well or even sometimes almost well done with no  pink at all and it's always frustrating. But I was very happy when my steak came back perfectly medium, leaning a bit towards medium rare. Just the way I like it. The taste of the Prime Rib is full of flavour, you can really taste how juicy and succulent the steak is. I love the horseradish and au jus on the side, though I only used tiny bits of the horseradish to compliment the steak, but not overpower it. 

Overall, I loved the Prime Rib and this location cooked it perfectly the way I asked. It was filling and fulfilled my cravings without costing me an arm and a leg, which is a definite win. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We went there last night for our anniversary dinner.  The parking was full and we had to park further away. When we came in they took our name, gave us a pager and said it would be 45 minutes to an hour. We were lucky, only waited 30 minutes. Our server was very friendly and explained the menu. He even gave a wine recommendation for my wife. We got good hot bread while waiting. When we got our steaks, my wife thought hers was overcooked (she wanted medium). The manager saw the steak and agreed that is was more than medium. She brought the steak back and gave my wife a new one properly cooked.   Everything was delicious (steak, sides).  We had a Billy Miner cake to share (delicious). Price is more than other places but the steaks are delicious. Customer service was excellent. Will certainly go again."}
{"text":"Not many options in the area and the Keg was rated very near the top.  A little disappointed given the rating but a solid choice.  I had the large prime rib which was good but nothing special, probably pre-made prime rib.  The highlight was actually the iceberg wedge salad, which had a ton of bleu cheese and fresh lettuce and tomatoes.  Not bad but not incredible."}
{"text":"I feel that there are far better steakhouses than the Keg if you are willing to search.

I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon and while I found the meat doneness to be pretty on par, nothing else really stood apart from any steak that I've had elsewhere before. I did appreciate the complimentary fresh baked bread and dessert, though.

The atmosphere here is quite intimate, but I found the lighting to be far too dim. However the servers were really friendly, but not overly so: it's nice to have a balance between chattiness and knowing when to let you be.

The verdict: great service, but personally, I think there are better steakhouses to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered a lobster tail, was very mushy, it was quality issue. Also found a hair in the topping of the bread. Although the mananger came later, apologized to us and got rid of appetizers and lobster tail on the bill, and one complimentary desert since we are celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. Overall, food was not so good that day, but the manager did try to make it up to us."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Keg that hasn't already been said. It was a bit of a wait today but knowing your going to have a great meal is all worth it. I went with the tenderloin Keg classic dinner.  Started with a Caesar salad which was perfect. Nice and crisp,very fresh! I had my steak medium well and it was cooked to perfection. The side of mashed was great as well. I went for the special which was adding crab legs to my meal! These were fantastic!  It was our anniversary and the sever gave us a complimentary Billy Miner pie. They didn't have to do this and it made our night very special. The pie was fabulous."}
{"text":"The keg is known as one of the most consistent restaurant chains in the city but tonight I has a little disappointed. The prime rib I ordered wasn't as good as usual hopefully this is a one time thing."}
{"text":"Amazing service, I've never went to keg and had a memorable steak, but the lobster topping on it was bless.

The lobster and cheese app was outstanding, also got the french onion soup and it was quite watery.

Really have to say the staff in richmond hill keg are amazing and extremely hospitable."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner and the service was amazing, our waitress Katie was very nice and always checking up on us. She made sure we had everything we needed and was also very helpful. One of the nicest waitresses I've had in a long time. She also made great conversation which I loved! Not to mention the food was delicious. I had gotten the steak and lobster with mash potatoes and my boyfriend got the rack of ribs with mash potatoes and both of us can say the food was 5/5!! We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Just like all kegs, you get consistency here. Great service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with The Keg. I've been here multiple times! The staff at this location are very friendly, very familiar with the menu and more importantly, take allergies very seriously. When made aware of my allergy, the manager came out to confirm the food items that I had ordered would be safe for me to eat and that meant a lot knowing that they took great care of me. The ambiance is nice, however some of the smaller tables for 2 are very close together and make it feel slightly crowded. Other than that, don't have anything negative to say!"}
{"text":"Came here on boxing day for dinner, we made a reservation 2 days before to be sure we can celebrate Christmas here. The interior is classy and warm but the lighting wasn't great for taking pictures of people. We ordered escargot for appetizers which were really good. For the mains, we ordered top sirloin (8oz) and new york striploin (12oz), all of them were perfectly cooked to medium rare. Then we finish our dinner with billy miner pie which is very delicious. The guy who serves us also did a great job explaining the menu and he is very nice!! Definitely will come here again to celebrate other special moments with family or friends!"}
{"text":"The Keg is a reliable option when in Canada! Stopped into this spot for a client dinner back in August. The service was great and the food was up to expectations for a Steakhouse. I had a straightforward filet mignon and baked potato, no bells and whistles because they didn't need them. Would go back if in the area and would easily stop into a different Keg location as the reputation is consistently good food at all their locations."}
{"text":"We went for a work dinner here while in town and had a lovely dinner! The interior is classy and warm. Gives a comfortable, steakhouse vibe. They have a very nice bar and great seating area. Sound doesn't carry so it has a intimate feel.

The appetizers were great! I really enjoyed the calamari! The escargot we're also tasty. They had two flavors and both were great. The brie cheese and toasts are also great!

The steak was delicious but huge! Definitely enough for sharing between two people. I had the 20oz ribeye rare and it was perfectly cooked. Good char but still cool center. I had the brussel sprouts and they were delicious. 

For dessert we shared the mini creme brulee and brownie. Both were delicious!! Perfect ending to the evening."}
{"text":"Server paid no attention to detail. Appetizers and entrees were not properly timed, in addition to being cold and bland.

We were offered free dessert to compensate for the blunders, but it left much to be desired. I've never seen or tasted an apple crisp like this- cold and smashed with virtually no apples.

To add to the headache, they billed us incorrectly. This was a disappointment, given the enjoyable meals we've had here before."}
{"text":"Always a consistent steak. Great for a nice casual steak dinner out with friends. Got the filet as usual. But if you want a nicer experience try their other restaurant HY's in downtown Toronto. Also their wines by the glass are great."}
{"text":"Keg has the best prime rib in town.  Have been to a lot of high end steak houses in GTA, and Keg is definitely the best value there is.  The food is always consistent no matter which Keg you go in the country.  The wine list consists of mainly new world selection, which suits most palates."}
{"text":"Love the steak and apps. Call for a reservation so you are not waiting long.  Food is awesome."}
{"text":"Just a great place! Friendly and prompt waitstaff, Good value and taste for the food!

There were 8 of us and we had a great time!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my steak from here, and mine did not break the bank. I also had their escargot; and it was soft and delicious. The wine I got, a glass of Pino Grigio from Italy was perfect. The atmosphere is warm and the service was outstanding. Keg doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Very professional and friendly staff. Took a while to get a table on the weekend but they served ordures while waiting, though not many. I ordered the teriyaki steak and was not as impressed as I was last time. too much fat for my taste and hardly any flavor. The rest was great like the double mash potatoes but if the steak is not up to par, it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Long line ups on weekends, got there at 6pm and didn't get a table until after 7:30pm, luckily we had a table at the bar for appys, but so many others were holding up the walls. Service was great, they brought our drinks from the bar to our table. 

Food is consistently done great every time I go, but today the Asiago rice was a tad greasy and bland and honey salmon was just ok. We were a table of 7, we all had steaks come out perfectly cooked, no one had an over or under cooked steak, except the one weirdo who ordered a medium well prime rib.....why???!!!

They always get our orders correctly, food is done well here, menu isn't the most exciting but it's decent. Decor is cozy and they seemed to fix the temperature issue by the windows, in the winter sitting by the window felt very chilly. Lighting here is darker than most places, I laugh how everyone uses their phone to read the menus, I could hardly take a decent photo for this review.

They change a few options every now and then, such as sweet potatoe fries but you can add squash? That doesn't even compare?!

I really enjoyed the tuna tartare appy, it's similar to the hawaiin poke served with wonton chips, the foundation being fresh avocado in a light sesame oil and the tuna doesn't taste too frozen. 

Service and food is consistent and done well here, very safe to bring a date here or to celebrate an event. 

Chocolate mints at the door have a mint candy shell followed by a chocolate paste."}
{"text":"I love the new space.  It has a great patio and great ambiance.  Very cozy inside as well.  The service is consistently good and they usually cook my steak perfectly the first time.  The downside is that the green salad was boring (the green salad with shredded cheese which they used to serve was much better in my view) and the cocktails taste watered down for my liking."}
{"text":"If anyone's visiting the Keg, it is usually because of the consistency of everything they do.  Came here with my parents and younger brother for a nice dinner, expected everything to be excellent while not over the top.  The Keg always meets expectations and made sure everything was precisely the way we wanted and ordered.

The boys (my dad, brother, and myself) all ordered their New York striploin classic dinners, while my mom had the Filet Mignon, all medium rare.  Sure, their steak may not be the absolute best in the world, but when you're craving a good steak around the north part of the city, this will have to do."}
{"text":"A solid restaurant that has great food and a good atmosphere. I've never been disappointed with what I ordered."}
{"text":"My experience at The Keg Richmond Hill has always been a phenomenal one. It was my mother's birthday and I couldn't think of a better restaurant to celebrate at. I have dined in the main dining room on several occasions and have quite enjoyed the chic and very classy decor but as it was quite busy for a Wednesday evening, we opted for patio seating. To start off, the table received some very heavenly bread and butter gratis. For starters, we got the jumbo shrimp cocktail (which actually came with JUMBO shrimps), fried calamari and bacon wrapped scallops. At this point in the meal, no complaints. For my meal, I got the N.Y. Strip with mushrooms and mixed vegetables. I also decided to try the creamy peppercorn sauce. My steak was deliciously seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium. But, what elevated the steak to the next level were the beautiful grills marks perfectly placed on my steak. I was not a big fan of the creamy peppercorn sauce and the waitress was kind enough to make other suggestions and provide me with another sauce. My sister thoroughly enjoyed her pistachio crusted salmon and my mother savored her Top Sirloin. Although none of us had any space for dessert, it was impossible to say no to the lovely chocolate ice cream cake layered on a base of crumbled oreos with caramel and chocolate syrup. Yes, it tasted as good as it sounds and it was on the house. Overall, a wonderful dining experience that most importantly is consistent."}
{"text":"One of the nicest, if not THE nicest Keg in the GTA!
This location is somewhat new, I'd say about 2-3 years, and the quality of food, service, ambiance has been consistent top notch

Management and staff are very professional, know the menu inside out, and ready to make recommendations and/or modifications to suit your preference.
This KEG is split into two sections, the bar and lounge section which has a beautiful semi-open patio facing the parking lot.
What's nice about this lounge section that it doesn't only have the regular cocktail chairs/tables you found at bars, they also have booths, lounge chairs, and small little couches. So it's basically another dining room but in a more casual setup, where you can catch a game or watch something on TV while you have your meal, or waiting for your table at the main dining room.
The main dining room is fancy, fireplaces, nice designs, and is certainly huge with so many tables and little booths, although it may not seem like it.
In terms of food, I find it that this location has one of the best tasting menus, although it should be all unified! The NewYork steak and pepper corn sauce are flawless, so is the calamari, chili chicken, nachos and their porterhouse steak

Customer service here is great, you always have more than one server taking care of your table, while there is always a third staff member cleaning up and setting up tables.
If you're looking for a nice KEG to celebrate a special occasion, to go on a date, or to have a business meeting, look nowhere else!"}
{"text":"Great decor & food The Keg is the nest place for ribs and I hope it stays that way. OUr Waiter's was very slow but hey it was late so who knows."}
{"text":"Talking about consistency! I have been to this Keg for years and I have never have a disappointing experience!

Service is always good and friendly. My steak always cooked the way I like and if there's any issue, the staff is always happy to have it redone.

Special requests always fulfilled with a smile: less salt, sauce on the side, more vegetables instead of starch... 

I love their dinning room in this new location: more spacious, have more lighting and higher ceiling.

Yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"Great steaks served - as well as drinks!

I came in early yet not early enough for their happy hour (Open - 6pm) = bummer yet I digress...

Had a couple of choice cocktails and went right into a Keg Classic with a Caesar salad, Bacon-wrapped Filet and an accompaniment of Sautéed mushrooms.

The staff timed this amazing and had a perfect rare filet on the table as I finished my Caesar salad.

The staff will chat you up - if you want - yet know how to read your signals and leave you be. What a crew! I enjoyed the bar staff and their knowledge of my latest dietary endeavors. They helped me tweak my meal to what I considered perfection.

This place is a great place for a great steak when in the Richmond Hill area. I was here for business travel but would go back if the chance arises once more!"}
{"text":"Went to this Keg Steakhouse few months back, and it was one of my best experiences ever. This location was a little dark, but it was the whole environment of the restaurant. The mood was great for a fancy dinner with some good friends. I ordered the 20oz Rib Steak, medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I love steak a lot, and if it is not cooked perfectly I would be really disappointed. The management and service was excellent. My friend ordered a steak, but it was too chewy for her preference and they changed it immediately. At that point I was really happy with the service, especially when the manager came out and check up on us and apologized for her order. After we finished our meal, the manager went above and beyond by asking the waitress to give us a dessert for the inconvenience. I do highly recommend people to come try out this place. 

Service: 5/5
Management: 5/5
Environment: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5

Overall: 5/5"}
{"text":"I normally try to avoid chain restaurants when I'm traveling especially chains that I have back home in Seattle but after a subpar meal at a local place, I decide to give the keg a shot.

It was great.  I arrived before the rush and was immediately seated.  The service was great.  Not too pushy but attentive.  I got the classic prime rib(10oz), medium rare.  It was perfect!  The salad and sides that accompanied the meal we large and very filling.

Definitely recommend this location if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while since it is expensive to eat for one person.  However, I went with a few friends and my friend and I shared one of my favorite steaks, the top baseball sirloin steak.  However, to eat with my friend I needed to order medium rare. :)

Anyway, I ordered it Chicago Style medium rare. They did it right the first time and it tasted awesome.  Though it is a bit dry because it is medium rare.

Although I normally prefer blue rare; the baseball sirloin won't cook correctly if you request blue rare Chicago style (it will get too dry inside which is opposite of what you would expect) so get at most rare Chicago style for the best taste and texture.

We also ordered a Keg sized order of their nachos shared among 5 people with Jalapenos and olives on the side.  Very light and yummy except for the parts that had the cheese clumped which still tasted good (though it is heavy)

And we got one virgin strawberry daiquiri since my friend never tried it before.  Also great.

Overall great food, great price if you are willing to share."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I attend the keg quite regularly, 2-3 times a month. Although this location is the closest to me, I try my best to avoid it. 

The food is great, of course, steaks are always done exactly how I want, but some of the staff here have the WORST attitude. You'd think the wait staff would be happy to work here, apparently for some here that's not the case. 

Last time I came here, we were served by a gentleman (will not include name) who had the worst attitude I've ever experienced. He didn't give a single s*it about us or our experience, wasn't helpful with menu items (for those in party), I had to tell them what was good and what to avoid, and when he made mistakes on our order, several mistakes at that, although he did correct them, he was a huge d*ck about it. 

Not to mention the DISASTER parking lot in which this building is surrounded by. Arrive an hour early just to park, then go inside and wait another two for a table. 

There are much nicer, more friendly Keg locations around the city! Little bit more of a drive but definitely worth it when it means avoiding this huge headache."}
{"text":"With most things, there is a balancing point or a tipping point.  The point at which one small fleck of dust will bring everything down.  Staff that cannot handle small changes to service should not be in the service industry.

Not the first time it happened here but Tuesday night was a \"memorable\" one.

DInner for 4.  Kind of VIP Dinner.

The server comes and intros himself.  Then says that he is slammed with a party next to us but will come back to take our drink order soon.  

GONG! goes the Death Knell.  For those who don't know what that is, here is the link:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_knell

You already know that things are not going to be good when excuses fly even before service.  Finally he comes back and we order our drinks.

Time flies and another server pops by and says hi!  Your server is slammed so I'm going to assist him - you know, tag team.  Can I take your drink order.  Uhm...we already did the drink order and are still waiting to wet our whistles....GONG!

Bread and appy arrive.  Finished them.  We are famished.  Tables around us have already gotten their meals - though they ordered well after us.  GONG!

Had it with our tag-team.  Spoke to a manager and he said he will check on the meal.  Finally arrives and then another manager comes to apologize.  She says our window of service is 20 minutes and you are at 24 minutes so we missed our mark...so sorry.  As in...what is your problem, we are only 4 minutes behind our mark...!  Uhm...no...you are 24 minutes behind your original mark of 20mins that makes this service at 44mins.  GONG!

After everything was said and done, they forgot my salad - really, did you need to cook that medium also?  .... \"ting...\" sorry got tired from ringing the bell that I can only muster a small \"ting.\"  Gonna need some tiger-balm!

My comment to them is that if you got \"slammed\" because of a couple of parties, you obviously don't have your game down...esp. for a chain that has been around for decades!  Unacceptable.

Meal was comp'd.  Then the drinks ended up comp'd. The desserts and coffee was comp'd.  And that makes the whole ruined evening OK right?  NO!  No service industry has the right to ruin anyone's night and say that all is OK cause you got a free meal.  You ruined the dinner.  You ruined the meeting.  You ruined the reason I was at the meeting.  We were saying thank you and goodbye to a retiring director.

GONG!  Or is it going going GONE!

1.5 stars.  At least when we got the meal, the food was on point.

Jeers!"}
{"text":"Great steak no complaints. Had the baseball top sirloin classic dinner with baked potato , veggies . Iceberg Wedge Salad with the creamy   dressing .

And the New York Strip, with  Asiago rice and  Veggies.  

Steak was tender and easy to swallow .

Only con was food took around 25 minutes to arrive in a half packed place ."}
