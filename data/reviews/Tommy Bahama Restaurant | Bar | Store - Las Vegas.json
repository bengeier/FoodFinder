{"text":"Tommy Bahamas is great.  I have eaten at their restaurants in Maui, Palm Desert, and here in Vegas- they are all consistently fabulous.  Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights."}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos!!! I love the island feel of the restaurant. It's so relaxed and they wait staff has been great each time I have gone. This is one of favorite places to eat. The Sangria is also tasty!!"}
{"text":"YUM!  YUM-O!  Takes me back to the Florida Keys with Jimmy Buffet singing in the background....a little son of a son of a sailor rings harmoniously through my ears.

Décor is so very Florida Keys 1980 green and yellow floral, with a large amount of wicker. A perfect night for a little date!  I mean, that's what I did...maybe it's good for other occasions too :-) ...off the subject.

We sat at the bar and our server was extremely kind and attentive.  We had the poke appi and shared a fried fish sandwich (not quite Florida Keys Greg's Restaurant with the fried grouper sandwich), but oh so close.  The key lime pie was fantastic coupled with a hot cup o'joe.  

I will be back for a full dinner next...the menu looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here, service is always good, food better than average."}
{"text":"Always come here for a break from gambling.  Solid food good drinks and nice atmosphere; island time."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i went here last night during \"island time\" which is happy hour.. the place was all but empty so that was a plus... the decor is an island theme and very laid back. Our waitress was very attentive and was full of suggestions. there was a 3 course for $33 per person menu which wasn't bad at all we had a goat cheese appetizer, the \"famous\" coconut shrimp which were huge (delicious) and split a small Caesar salad. for an entrée we both had the island cowboy medallions.... they were cooked to perfections and were so juicy the mashed potatoes were run of the mill and the asparagus weren't tough at all... for desert i had the key lime pie which i thought was way too bitter and the coconut cake my girl had was sweet and not overrun with coconut taste.... the mai tai i had was done pretty well and the drink my girl was recommended was super strong.... only downside of the evening outside the key lime pie was we had to ask for water it wasn't just brought out with meal and the bread (which was hot and (tasty) was accompanied with apple butter we both thought that with all the sweet notes we ordered a salty one would have worked better but all in all i loved that place and i will return again"}
{"text":"We come to Tommys often, usually for bdays, special occasions, etc, and it has become a favorite spot for us. The service is great with exceptional food. Tonight we had Naomi and she was attentive, friendly, polite and all around awesome. She even surprised us with a special anniversary dessert! She truly gave us an a memorable experience and we will be asking for her next time!"}
{"text":"I hope the hour and half wait for the food is well worth it since we are sitting next to the kitchen door watching the group getting served as plates after plates come scrolling by.... Not even busy. 
Not much seafood options unless it's drenched in coconut...... Still  waiting still waiting. ....
The kids meal finally came. 
Waiting. ... waiting. ... that looks good! Waiting. .....
For the price of what you get and the taste, this place is not worth a second try."}
{"text":"With burgers being such a polarizing topic, everyone seems to think they know they best around. So naturally everyone I know constantly recommends another place in town, half of which I dismiss because they just sound awful. Such is the case with Tommy Bahama when a contractor named David I'm working with in town mentioned it. Out of all the places people throw out there, a clothing store has not been one of them and instantly sounded awful. After much persuasion, and perhaps the offer of a free meal, I caved and went with him to check it out. Could a chain known for its clothes also sport a restaurant with a VBB-worthy burger?

The restaurant is located in Town Square which can be a pain to visit at times, but also offers great people watching in the right spots.  And Tommy's definitely has a great patio outside to do just that. The inside of the restaurant looks a lot like their clothing stores with muted colors, decorative ceiling fans and pendant lights with sea shells on them. There's also a decent sized bar which is a quick way to drop in and out for a bite even when they're busy.

I can't speak much to the menu based on my visit as David knew exactly what we were ordering and placed it right away. It is available online though, and has quite a few options. The burger selected for me was the Smokehouse Angus Burger: prime Angus, toasted brioche, roasted garlic aioli, sharp white cheddar, red onion and Nueske's bacon. Upon first bite I noticed instantly that the bun was great, almost challah-like. It was soft on the outside, grilled and crispy on the inside. The top bun had a sweet ketchup spread on it, the bottom had the garlic aioli. Both spreads were minimal and just enough for flavor without being overpowering or messy. The meat had great flavor and was cooked close to my medium-rare that was ordered. The onions were fresh and not overpowering, but I still took some off as to not hijack too much of the overall flavor. The star of this burger by far was the bacon; it was crunchy, thick and had terrific flavor.

The fries weren't awful; they had good flavor and weren't oily or stale as they have often been around town lately. I wished for a bit more, but they didn't detract from the meal as a few have. As a whole I was definitely impressed with this burger, I really wasn't expecting much coming into it and got way more than expected. And although I didn't pay for this meal (thanks David!), I would say that the $13.50 menu price might be a bit steep for this. I don't know if I would include it in my Vegas 'must have' list as this is still a bit of a chain, but if you're in Town Square and looking for a good burger you should definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour, the tuna is outstanding. There has never been a wait and the staff has been great."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment drop in for a take away lunch order. (I didn't have much time so I took a huge chance here.)

The bar was pretty empty for a Tuesday at 12:30ish. Julian the bartender was very funny & informative. After a quick peruse of the menu I decided on the HOUSE ROASTED PORK SANDWICH (bbq pulled pork) and I was quoted 10 minutes...let the timer begin!

My order arrived within the time quoted and after a 15 minutes drive to the office my lunch was still piping hot. AND DELISH!!  I've never had a piled high pulled pork as good as this one. I didn't even need to add bbq sauce as the flavor without stood on its own. Totally impressed & well worth the $13.50!

I arrived back at work on time. 

I'll be back for more of this. It was HUGE & enough for lunch AND dinner."}
{"text":"An okay choice for food in Town Square, but a little on the heavy side.  

Like most popular American restaurants, they cover the three essential food groups--fat, sugar and salt.  Throw in a beer, and they will be a success."}
{"text":"Absolutely thrilled!  Went with my my family for my son's birthday,party of 9.  We were seated immediately.  The restaurant was not busy, but everything was ready for a big crowd if needed. The hostess was smiling and pleasant, and our server Phil came right over to get us started.  Everything we were served was perfect. Steak cooked correctly....my son couldn't stop raving about the asparagus.  The manager even came over and visited with us. Thank you so much for the experience.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you to my fellow helpers for their helpful and detailed reviews!!!! The reviews prompted me to give the TB restaurant a try for my bday dinner in Vegas. We were tempted to go to some well known places on the strip but opted for TB, due to time constraints and proximity. Boy oh boy, we were so not disappointed!!!! From the first greeting to the bread to the meal, everything was fabulous. The bread with cinnamon butter was melt in your mouth yummy and the drinks were worth it. My hubs devoured the truffle-thyme salmon, I indulged in the macadamia but crusted snapper served with almond rice & asparagus, and my toddler enjoyed the chicken tenders (they were crunchy and light goodness). The servers were friendly and attentive, as my water glass never went empty. It seemed like she had a magic button on the glass or something. To top it off we even received a birthday dessert on the house!!!!  That was a complete surprise and oh so appreciated. The piña colada cake did not disappoint. It was like a melt in your mouth cake, which my hubs compared to cotton candy. The slice is so enormous that we couldn't even finish it. The linen type napkins were also an added plus along with the breath taking plantation decor & ambiance. Thank you, TB Restaurant for making my bday experience a great one. We are lookin for other locations to try next!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Tommy Bahamas out for restaurant week and our experience was so-so. We arrived around 5 and were sat at a nice table by the patio. Our appetizers were delicious, I had the lobster bisque and my fiancé had the coconut shrimp. 

Unfortunately after our appetizers we waited almost another 30 minutes before our meal came out. When it did arrive, my steak and potatoes was cold. It was obvious the steak had been sitting in the window- it was sliced, dried out and almost medium well ( I ordered it medium). I have never had cold mashed potatoes at a restaurant before- I was pretty shocked. My fiancés fish was cooked perfectly and was warm, no complaints on his dish. It was more disappointing because the restaurant was not busy. 

When our server came over to collect our dirty dishes she asked if we were ready for her to put our dessert order in which explained why our dinner had come out so long after our appetizers! She didn't even ring our meals in until we were done with our appetizers! Overall our meal took two hours because of poor judgement and timing by our server. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Having just dined at Tommy Bahamas I felt the need to immediately write this review. I have been blown away by what I originally thought would be a marginal lunch but what turned out to be a fantastic experience. Our server Dominique was impeccable. Her knowledge of the menu was impressive and her recommendations were right on as well. The spicy meatball sandwich was amazing. I will definitely return and bring friends and clients to Tommy Bahamas in the future and request Dominique every time."}
{"text":"First time to Tommy Bahama in Vegas and I will be back.  Incredible selection of rums, as in pages if rums from around the world.  The manager came by and gave us some recommendations and we were all happy with the options we chose.

The appetizer of ahi poke was delicious, as were the coconut shrimp.  The grilled chicken and mango salad was excellent.  Perfect combo of fresh and light with a nice grilled chicken breast.  The filet and the fish tacos were very good also. 

A great, refreshing drink option was the rum with ginger beer.  A little sweet but I wanted another.  I will be a regular with the drink selections and the great food.  I'm ready to go back now!"}
{"text":"Hello new favorite happy hour spot!! Brian,the bartender, made me the most delicious coconut cloud martini I have ever tasted! The tuna poke and blackened fish tacos are a must on the happy hour. 4-7 everyday in the bar. Self seat. Love it!!"}
{"text":"On our way out of town, stopped here and had a wonderful lunch.  We sat outside on the patio in the absolutely perfect weather.

Service was excellent!  Our server was cheery, attentive, professional, and had a great sense of humor.

The Mai Tai drinks were phenomenal - not too sweet, the right amount of rums (perfect dark rum float), completely refreshing.

The food was very good.  Hubby had House Roasted Pork Sandwich - a huge helping of pulled pork in a blackberry brandy bbq sauce (so delicious!) on top of fresh crunchy slaw with skinny crispy fried onions piled on a toasted bun.  It was served with some of the best fries around.

I had a cup of the crab bisque, which was very tasty but really thick in consistency.  Too thick for my preference.  The Bungalow Salad, however, was fantastic.  Made with greens, dried blueberries, Feta cheese, tomatoes, pepitas, and toasted almonds and macadamia nuts in a lemony vinaigrette, it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that the service at. Tommy Bahama restraunt is TOP NOTCH! They kept my ice cream cake in their freezer, gave us plates, knife, forks to eat the cake with, doggie bag the extra pieces of cake, and washed my cake container! All that with no cake fee!!! The waitress was super nice and was not bothered by us asking her to doggie bag the cake two times."}
{"text":"We stopped by after movie. Something new. Not hungry enough for full meal so we shared the small plate sliders and fish tacos on the happy hour menu.  We are always looking for great artichokes. Considering they are really out of season the artichokes were not bad - great dip but a little under cooked and off the regular menu. In all with the live music, great service and food a nice end to date night! Server was Huulan and she excelled!"}
{"text":"They looked at me funny when they brought out the pitcher of Sangri and I asked for a straw. It was a little sweet but had a great brandy kick. We stop at all of them for a pitcher and a bowl of lobster bisque. I wish I could mass produce that stuff, and in the winter I could freeze it and skate on it and then in the spring when it melts I could eat it.

Sooooooo good."}
{"text":"All I have to say is jerk chicken dish is on point.  Late night specials, can't beat it.  Staff is friendly.  Would recommend for the late nighters."}
{"text":"we were going to another restaurant ,but it had a 25 min wait so we decided to give TB a shot.  I saw the menu an wanted to leave the prices were a little high and the menu was kind of small.   We ordered the crab cakes calloway and the big island goat cheese w/ island flat bread.. First the crab cakes they were two about 2oz ea.. it was on an asian cole slaw which sat in a pool of sweet chile sauce and olive oil.
          The slaw was good but the sweet chile sauce was way too sweet, the crab cakes were meaty not to much filler and were good.
        The big island goat cheese with mac nuts and a sweet soy sauce glaze was pretty good but did not care for the island bread that came with it , more like a cracker.
          We both ordered the cuban sandwich it came with fried yucca. The sandwich was very good . It was pressed nicely so it had a nice crispness to it. The ham and roast pork was a decent amount. Everything was nicely balanced. The fried yucca was intresting it had a crisp crust and a creamy texture in the middle not much flavor like a potato. I kinda got used to it ,wife did not like it.  Service was very good. I took a star away for pricing and a small menu.  I think bahama breeze is a better deal and they have  a very diverse menu,if your looking for carribbean flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for a bite to eat and a few drinks. Sat in the bar area and ordered blackened fish tacos, coconut shrimp along with some fish and chips. The blackened fish tacos had grease dripping from them no where near blackened, the fish and chips was so greasy it was soggy, and the coconut shrimp was almost brunt. This is not the usual for this location but it has made me take them off the list until they get it together in the kitchen.

The drinks didn't fair much better. I ordered a Manhattan straight up. The most basic of cocktails and it came with foam on it. What the hell is foam doing on a Manhattan? I'm used to ice chips that dilute the drink but foam that's new."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the food dishes, and the service was terrific! Will definitely go back again for lunch or dinner...with the girls or with couples. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great service and surprisingly delicious chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"We had to change our reservation to 5:30 and that was no problem.  Our friendly greeting was followed with a round of drinks in a timely manner.  Very well appointed drinks were finished along with a special asparagus soup prepared by chef Reuben.  Waitress Dominique professionally handled our orders while manager Kevin oversaw the entire dining experience.  We were treated like royalty during our meal because the way to determine if our waitress is doing a great job is by not noticing her serving the table.  The food was cooked correctly and the presentation was excellent.  Remember when the food looks good it usually tastes good.  Our food was superb.  Our salad was served on cold plates and the entree was served on hot plates.  This enabled the course to remain in the proper temperature through consumption.  We completed our meal with the piña colada cake.  It was a huge slice that we split between the four of us and we were left licking our forks.  I cannot remember a meal that was any better from the beginning to end.  Our thanks to the staff for a job well done because we will definitely return.  In the past the 3 most important words in the restaurant business was location, location, location;  but currently the 3 most important words are \" I'll be back\"!  And all of us agree that we will return."}
{"text":"My first time to a TB and was pleasantly surprised al the way around. We had a large party of 11 and our host had eaten here the week before for the first time with a large group. The apps that we ordered were all killer especially the Ahi tuna tacos, and poki.
Overall, everyone enjoyed their entrees or salads as well as the desserts. Service was great however, we had dinner on the early side."}
{"text":"Dinner was poor service, bad food and too expensive.  Good location for happy hour only."}
{"text":"The place is nice, quiet and roomy and the service is quite friendly, they gave me a free dessert on my birthday! I have no problems with the food here and my favorite item by far is the coconut shrimp which is also on the happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere, singer and so many things about it...now the reason it is always empty is because the service is so frikin slow and inconsistent. It is such a shame. I just left the bar there and it took forever, again!! Come on folks, we want you to make it but you have lots of room for improvement!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with bread they serve here... or should I say cinnamon butter they serve with bread? Either way, it's free, and I'm pretty addicted to it.

I always order chopped salad here. It's so light but fulfilling. I believe they used to serve Tomato Soup here but the last time I checked, they didn't have it :( Should I try lobster bisque?"}
{"text":"Elected to take lunch here after shopping under the hot Nevada sun. I had a Cuban sandwich off the special lunch menu. The portions were a smaller size than standard however sufficient for most diners. Food was pleasant, nothing special and service was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Hey Maan!  Dis place is great.

We were on our way out of town and saw the sign \"Tommy Bahama restaurant in the town center\".  I have eaten in Scottsdale, Maui, Palm Desert and was looking forward to a \"leaving Las Vegas\" Mai tai.

We arrived just as they opened and sat outside in beautiful weather.  I started with a Mojito , rather than the Mai Tai and boy what a fine choice I made.  I never come to these for the food, rather I love the Island theme and Caribbean music, Steele drums etc.  But this time is was not just pleasantly surprised, it was delicious.  I had the Cobb salad and substituted shrimp for chicken and my bacon well done.  It was PERFECT!!!!!!

Double your vacation and make this your first stop in and your last stop on the way out.

{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a month as this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  When weather is good,  outdoor seating is perfect. It makes me feel like I'm actually on vacation!
I recommend the fish tacos or the shrimp & scallops with almond rice..both are amazing!  It is a little pricey but really worth it.  The wait staff is friendly and very accommodating. I brought my 22month old daughter and they made sure she was happy and kept checking on her to make sure she had whatever she needed to stay busy and content."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my hubs and family. Service was just okay. It was super busy because of the holidays but waitress tried her best.  4 stars is for the food.  We had the lollipop chicken and the ahi tacos for appetizers it was bomb!  I had the blackened fish tacos which came with plantains on the side. It was sooooo delicious. My family was also very satisfied with the entrée they chose. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama offers the locals and tourists alike the opportunity for a freshly prepared meal, drink or snack in an Oasis setting. Bonus- the free warm bread uniquely made in 4 pull-apart peaks is served with their homemade honey-cinnamon butter (churned on their $3,000 machine)!"}
{"text":"Pretty up-market kind of place.  The drinks and food were inventive, well-prepared and well presented.  I had the cheapest entree possible at @16.95... the blackened fish tacos which were excellent!  Next time I have the coffee-crusted ribeye steak... I can't even imagine what that'd be like.

Only place in the country I've found a \"Dark and Stormy\" (Ginger Beer with Dark Rum). Easy to get in the caribbean.  Tommy Bahamas makes a specialty out of its rum collection and concoctions."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated your 25th wedding anniversary at Tommy's in the Town Square. 

Our friends and family come from all over so our guests decided that our celebration would take place in Las Vegas. What better choice than the Marriage Capital of the World. Everything else was easy once the destination was selected. We immediately knew we were going to Tommy Bahamas.

We have been Tommy Bahama fans (both restaurant and retail) for a number of years.  We have always found the food, drinks, atmosphere and service exceptional based on our experiences in Orlando, Palm Springs, Scottsdale, Myrtle Beach and Las Vegas.   

Kaaren provided suggestions or assisted with coordinating a myriad of details including decorations, flowers, live music, menu, beverage and signature drinks, snacks, favours, and ensuring taxi services were available.

Finally our big day arrived.  We renewed our vows in the Bahama Room; adjourned to the Garden Room for champagne and hors d'oeuvres and then returned to the Bahama Room for dining and live music.

We could not have been more pleased with the success of the day.  Our guests attended from Bermuda, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Arizona and Nevada.  All of the guests commented on the wonderful venue and ambience.

We are already planning a return trip to Tommy Bahamas Las Vegas to celebrate our 26th anniversary, but on a much smaller scale. 

We hope to visit, have a Dark and Stormy and enjoy a dining experience at each and every Tommy Bahama restaurant location as part of \"Living The Life\".

Our sincere thanks for a fabulous day.

Till next time,"}
{"text":"Here for lunch. No line, no wait at all on a Wednesday afternoon. My second time at this location within the last year. It appears as though they changed up their menu a bit. Ordered the chicken lollipops (I think that's what it was called) for an appetizer and they were good. Wouldn't order again, too sweet for my liking. For my entree I had the kona coffee crusted ribeye. So good! (No taste of coffee whatsoever). Dish came with cauliflower mash and lemon arugula. The flavor was amazing! I recommend it. For dessert, I ordered their pineapple creme brûlée. Very pretty dessert & tasty! Only bad thing about lunch was I wanted a lemonade and the server said they were all out! Smh disappointed but ok...he didn't recommend anything else to drink either. But besides that, service was good. Don't forget to ask for warm bread with your meal!"}
{"text":"I went to Tommy Bahama's with my friends from NY for New Year's and I must say- It was an amazing experience!

To start, we ordered 2 pitchers of fall sangria and goat cheese for appetizers. In addition, the chef gave us a lil amuse-bouche of chicken and potatoes as complimentary for visiting for the first time! For entrée, we shared the fish&chips, steak salad, and pork chop special. We couldn't get any desserts because we were full but our server (he was Asian but I cannot remember his name) and manager (I remember her name-- it was Emily) were both super friendly and very accommodating. I remember Emily's name because she gave us a free dessert card to use in NY! 

Despite the date when we went (which was Jan 2nd) and despite the fact that it was on a Friday night, the restaurant was not crowded at all and we could not have asked for a better experience.

AMAZING PLACE. I would highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"We booked the private room for our wedding reception.  From the start, Kaaren was so helpful,  friendly and responsive to our ever changing head count.  Even though we arrived 25 minutes early, they quickly adjusted and our guest were promptly escorted into the room.  The buffet tables had fresh flowers that added the perfect touch.  The food was incredible! Days later our guests are still raving about coconut shrimp and Pina colada cake. Everything was so good! The drinks were amazing! No weak drinks! The 2 wait staff were friendly,  always on point and very attentive to all our guests needs and requests.  

They made this part of getting married easy,  seamless and as little stress as possible.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for a concert a few months ago. We all got there right at 11AM for the 1PM show. It was kind of an oversight on the restaurant since there was a major event taking place in the middle of Town Square (right outside the restaurant) and there's apparently a rule about no competing events in the same spot. The 1PM show got moved to somewhere around 3PM or 4PM. Throughout the afternoon it was pretty hard to get any accurate info on the exact when and where of anything and where to wait, etc. Not even the band had the info to give us since the restaurant hadn't figured out all the kinks yet. We were all starving and got take out from inside the restaurant. The food was pretty good. We got a variety of items and everything tasted awesome. Once everything got going it was a bit more organized but still a bit confusing. I think the really great meal got a bit overshadowed by the unorganized event that we were all there for; I might give it another try."}
{"text":"If you get the chance to check out Town Square and do some shopping, Tommy Bahama's is a great place to eat lunch or dinner.  It is so nice to sit outside on the patio when the weather is nice!  Sometimes there is a band playing live music in the grassy area nearby which sets a nice atmosphere.  

We have tried:

LOKI-LOKI TUNA POKE*
Fresh Ahi Napoleon, guacamole, capers, soy and sesame oil with island flatbread $16.50 

LOVE IT!  

SABA STEAK SALAD*
Marinated, char-grilled tenderloin medallions, grilled potatoes, roma tomatoes, shiitake chips, garlic aioli & tamarind vinaigrette $17.50 

CABO FISH TACOS
Blackened white fish, blended corn & flour tortillas, pico de gallo, chipotle aioli & Asian slaw $14.00 

We were pleased with everything each time we ate here... oh and the bread with butter they bring out is awesome yummy!  :)"}
{"text":"Made reservation for Valentines Day. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was good. Started with our absolute favorite the chicken lolly pops. We ordered their Valentines \"Special\" for two... 18oz prime rib and lobster (though we exchanged the lobster for chicken). It came with an amazing Gouda mac n cheese, asparagus, and herbed potato wedges."}
{"text":"The customer service at this store is Exemplary! From the moment you walk in the store all of your senses get stimulated. The aroma, the friendly staff who are so attentive to your every need and the GM who went above and beyond to make his customer happy!! Thank you James Williamson.... your store should be a used as a model of how great customer service makes your store just AWESOME!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Took the wife and kids and we all loved our meal. It was expensive but it was worth every penny. I think good again"}
{"text":"Happy hour great mojito coconut shrimp fish taco Cuban sandwich coconut cloud martini and great service always good times"}
{"text":"This location is in Town Square, I think it's a hidden gem, you dont expect a restaurant inside a retail store. The ambiance is actually warm- love the candles and the fresh lilies on your table. The hostesses are super friendly and there is always a table. My favorite is the filet mignon and their cauliflower potato mash. It has a red wine mushroom reduction sauce so it makes the filet even more flavorful. Before your steak ALWAYS get the macadamia crusted goat cheese appetizer- truly mouthwatering! Their salads are stellar, their steak is unforgettable with their fried shiitake as their \"crouton\". Overall I love Tommy Bahama... really great steaks! Romantic for date nights as well."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Right in the heart of Town Square. Appetizers are awesome, I had the coconut shrimp, and the scallop sliders. Sliders could have been better but the shrimp was one of the best I've ever had. I had a burger (was in the mood) and it was outstanding. Cooked perfectly. Perfect beef:bun ratio, toppings were spot on. The folks I was with had the stuffed shrimp and a salmon special both of which looked  really good. This was my second time there and wasn't disappointing either time. Well done. I never want to go here, but I'm never disappointing when I do."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great tasting food. We stopped here for lunch before going to the airport. It is only a mile from the car rental return so it has a great location. Restaurant is located in a local town center with lots of shops and other places to eat. 

Brandon was our server and he was so nice. Took time to explain the menu to us and even brought a complementary first course since it was our first time there. 

We had tuna tacos for an appetizer and they were amazing! Must get them!

For lunch I had the blackened fish tacos and my husband had the jerk chicken sandwich. Both were so good!

This is a place I would definitely go back to!"}
{"text":"I just came here for dessert after a bad dinner experience at a nearby restaurant.  My friend and I shared a chocolate cake dessert and the pina colada cake dessert while sitting on the patio.

Dessert and coffee was all we had, but it was a great experience.  It felt like being on vacation at this restaurant.  The service was also great.  A little bit slow, but overall a great evening experience.  I'm definitely going back to try their lunch or dinner menu items."}
{"text":"Excited to have an upscale dinner tonight at Tommy Bahama ... but was greatly disappointed. The food was excellent... enjoyed their 5 Star crab cakes and lump crab avocado salad ! What was HORRIBLE was the loud live music, which was anything but tropical. We were seated as far away from the bar area as possible ... but only taking our dinner \"to go\" would've been the best choice. So we ate, made the best of it (because we loved the food) and left! Our terrific server ... perfect ... we let her know we loved her, the food but probably won't come back because of the music & atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family stopped in for our second visit to TBLV around lunch time.  I was fortunate to have manager Kevin to make us some off the menu rum concoctions!  We all had various cocktails and they were all fantastic.  Atmosphere was relaxed but attentive.  Our drinks never ran dry.  We then had a fantastic lunch in the dining room.  All the food was excellent with a great variety to choose from .  Our server Jim was great!  Took care of us as well.  This is a permanent stop for me whenever I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting the price to be so high, I came in due to curiosity because I didn't know this clothing store was also a restaurant. The bread you get with butter is flavorless and dense. I had the tuna and it was pretty good. My friend has the macadamia crusted fish and it was not good at all I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Overall it's basic food with unjustified pricing. My dish with a few pieces of tuna was $32! It was cool to try once but I would not regularly dine here."}
{"text":"I come here every time I come to vegas now because I love the food and the cocktails ;) the artichoke appetizer is delish and i usually ask for extra lemon aoili. I like the cant e lope drink and the pineapple martini. The ahi tuna tacos and blackened fish tacos are yummy. I've had the key lime pie, chocolate cake and pineapple creme brulee and all of them are good. They also serve this bread before your meal with a sweet butter yum. The servers are all very friendly and i feel right at home"}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour in the bar.  The salads are good, along with the tacos.  Sip the guacamole and cream cheese dips, very strange.  Drinks are half price, service is good.  Bonus is the live music in the bar area."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I love their food, their Meomi, their ambiance, their patio, I just like it a lot. I've had both great, amazing experiences here and one not so hot. Overall I like this place a lot. I would recommend them to my friends and still do. The restaurant itself is located in a great area. Has a great staff, and their dishes are some of the best I've had in Town Square. Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and always go here when I'm craving a Cuban sandwich. Cool atmospheres and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you're willing to make the trek out here, it's fabulous! I first fell in love with the Tommy Bahama restaurant in Orlando and this one sure didn't disappoint.

Everyone in our group was really happy with their entrees. There was a chicken mango salad, crab-stuffed shrimp, coffee rubbed steak, and a chicken. I can't remember which chicken, but it was ordered at the recommendation of our server and was fabulous! We ate surprisingly little seafood, but if the crab-stuffed shrimp are any indicator of how good the seafood is - we'll need to go back for more! So yummy!

Save room for the key lime pie too!

It's also much more reasonably priced than on-strip restaurants. That's probably a no brainer, but it's nice to know. 

Also loved the service. We were the last ones in there, but never felt rushed or pressured to hurry it up."}
{"text":"Very fantastic restaurant in a nice shopping complex, it's right next to the Tommy Bahamas store. I was quite surprised to enjoy such a nice meal while shopping. 

We had the fish tacos and the scallop sliders both were perfect.  We also has the crab bisque which was very salty.  Would not recommend you drink as a soup but it was fantastic as a dip for the bread.  In fact the bread and the butter here were both fantastic. 

Service was great and kid friendly.  They have a kids menu with easy to digest food and a little drawing kit for kids to play with. 

I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday for a late lunch.   Atmosphere is very nice, open and airy, even in the Las Vegas heat.    I ordered the crab cake appetizer as a small portion, which they allow you to do on selected items.   It came with a wonderful asian coleslaw, and was very refreshing and delicious.   Wish I ordered the full size appetizer, it was far better than expected!

I also had the pork sandwich with blackberry brandy barbeque sauce.  It's basically a pulled pork sandwich with onion straws, and it was very good, as were the crispy fries.    The only reason that they didn't get 5 stars was due to the timing of my food.   The sandwich came out before the appetizer, so I had to ask to see if they forgot this item.   A minor issue, since this was ordered at the bar, and I'd expect table servers to be more on their game.

I had the New Belgium Ranger IPA on tap, very nice!   I didn't bother having them list all beers on tap, but this was a great option.

Overall, I will definitely be back, and would recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Always awesome staff in the whole restaurant, especially the bar.  I also love the live entertainment.  (Call for times)  
GM Kevin, bartenders Julian, Brian & Jennifer are super.  

Food mentioned in my previous reviews stand the same.. the most tasty & consistently fabulous.  I love the rums, wines & HH.  Chicken lollipops, Scallop sliders, Duo of Dips, Thai Shrimp & Scallops, Mahi Fish Tacos (to die for w/ the plantain side), Fish Sandwich, Stuffed Chicken Sanibel, Roasted Veggies w/ Cauliflower Steak & Chicken, Steak Salad w/ Tamarind Sauce, Pulled Pork Quesadillas, Ahi Tuna Stack, let me think... lol I guess I named more than enough.  Not only are these a few of my consistent faves, but I haven't ever been disappointed at this locations.  I once told a friend that this location was better than the one in Maui.  It truly is.  Thank you chef's for that."}
{"text":"What an experience!! We started by ordering the crab cakes and steak flatbread: both were super!!
We then had the ribs (melt in your mouth and that bbq sauce is yummmm), the fish tacos were also great!! 
We couldn't stop there, we had to have coffee and dessert. If you love chocolate like me, their chocolate cake with Oreo crust is the best choice, just make sure that you save enough room; the cake is super rich and it was too much for both of us.
I'm sorry, I forgot our server's name, but she was really nice and helped us with a couple choices. She really made our experience even better."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Happy hour is one of a kind and always hits all points. Just a reminder, happy hour is busy busy, so have some damn patience :)"}
{"text":"Love the wine, the service, and the fresh food of this restaurant located at Town Square. Music is good too :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We went with a party of 6 people and everyone was happy with their food. I got a macadamia crusted fish and it was really good. I didn't get a drink but everyone else liked their mixed drinks. Our server made recommendations when asked and knew the menu and ingredients really well. I also got a fruit salad for dessert and it was on point. Lots of mango and pineapple and strawberries. I'd definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"A pretty good dining experience overall.  The server was very friendly and accommodating.  The food was yummy and the cocktails were great.  The menu choices were a bit limited.  I also wanted a side of steamed veggies for my preschooler, and the only choices were asparagus and green beans.  No carrots, peas, or broccoli in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"We here all the time. We love it. We especially like their happy hour. Their fish tacos are the best in town and the live music is always very enjoyable. We've never had a bad meal at Tommy Bahama's"}
{"text":"The whole place was average. I thought the food was very plain and the atmosphere was not as fun as Tommy Bahama would portray."}
{"text":"Nice location, fun and good food. Even presented with a little something to try...Worth a trip especially if you are a Tommy Fan..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and realized I hadn't written a review. Probably because this is the kind of restaurant that is hard to write a review for...It's good, but not great. It has nice ambiance and good service, but nothing distinctive. It's in a good location, provided you don't mind going to Town Square. The food is good, and I like that it changes seasonally, but most of the menu is exactly what you'd expect to find at a restaurant that aims to please everyone. 

So I've been there before, and I'll go again, and I like the place. I just can't think of a reason to rave about it. Sometimes that's just what you want."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. 40 minutes and still haven't received our salads. Very inattentive staff. I will never done at this establishment again. Stay away if you'd like to receive your food in a timely manner. If they had negative stars I would use those."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a cocktail and a quick bite to eat for lunch on a recent trip. I had the ahi tuna tacos and a dark and stormy, and my wife had a mojito. The tacos came 4 to an order, but were so delicious I could have eaten a dozen by myself! The cocktails were just perfect, a good quality rum and a bartender who really knows their stuff makes a world of difference!"}
{"text":"I took my mother here on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm. The place seemed to be about half full. It's very stylish and the decor isn't cramped. Relaxing, but vibrant. We grabbed a table outside as it was close to the entrance because my Mom can't walk far. Our bullish choice may have been an inconvenient location for the waitstaff. The waitress was friendly and smart but we saw her very infrequently. Not sure, but she may have been a manager picking up slack. She told us what was especially popular on the menu, but we didn't take any of her recommendations. In hindsight, I think she was steering us toward the tastier items on the menu and away from the so-so items. She mentioned that they had fresh baked bread and we told her that would be great, but it never arrived and we didn't remind her. She seemed like she was playing catch-up on those occasions when we did see her. Kindly, she did make change for a dollar as the local parking meters there only take coins and we knew right off the bat they weren't going to be able to serve us our meal within an hour. We got the coconut shrimp appetizer and it was good, but not close to the best in town. Not the largest shrimp either. One of the four was much smaller than the others. The entrees took a long time. My Mom ordered a burger and for her taste, the bun was far too soggy. It was almost wet. She would have liked it to have been toasted. I can't see how that could have been eaten without silverware. We had to ask for salt, pepper and mustard as there wasn't any available on the table. Those items came quickly though. The french fries were kind of airy and relatively free of grease. I ordered the blackberry baby back ribs and they were okay, but nothing I would order twice. It was only a half rack, which was fine, but I think the item cost about $19, which for my experience, normally gets you a full rack. There were a few birds in the area begging for food and the people seated next to us fed them a full roll on the floor near our table. We could have done without the lengthy floor show that ensued, but that's hardly the restaurant's fault. Very clean restaurant from what I could see and very nice flatware as well. Nice people."}
{"text":"I came to Tommy Bahama Restaurant with a large group and we enjoyed our time outside on the patio for the most part. We were here during happy hour, so we enjoyed several different appetizers and drinks that were on the happy hour menu! The drinks were delicious, and the food was great! My favorite were the blackened fish tacos.

They only honor the happy hour menu in the bar (which there wasn't enough seats for our large group) and on the patio outside. It was a nice evening in Vegas, however it was very windy! We all decided to sit outside because we wanted to take part in happy hour. The large umbrellas they had outside to give us shade were blowing everywhere, and one even fell on my friend causing her drink to spill all over her. It was a little weird because the waiter turned it on us saying that \"they usually don't seat people outside when it's windy, but that they made an exception for us\". Mind you, there were many other parties sitting outside at that point so it wasn't just us. The manager never came out to apologize and even if they made an exception for us, the manager still should have apologized for the incident and made sure my friend was ok. We weren't even asking for a free drink or food, just a sincere apology would have been nice! I wouldn't mind coming back here again because the food was great, but I will definitely keep the experience I had in mind next time."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the service was great! Very attentive,  food came out quickly.  Coconut shrimp appetizer w/ a cabbage (cilantro) slaw was deLish! Cocktails....Pineapple Paradisio Martini, classic Mojito were tasty and refreshing. I had the jerk chicken tacos (appetizer but I had as an entrée) two tacos  w a small serving of corn & black beans....yummO! 
Next time we're saving room for dessert"}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good experience. Food was a little too sweet or salty for my taste but good nonetheless. 

I tried their prix fixe menu for Restaurant Week and got the Mahi mahi. It was a little too sweet for me - too much vinaigrette type sauce... added some lemon and it was good to go. I tried my friend's filet mignon and that was definitely good.

The peanut butter pie was like a giant reese's peanut butter cup. It was good for the first few bites but definitely too much for a full dessert. 

The service was a bit slow and probably was due to the dinner rush. I don't know if it'd be a good place to come when you're super hungry. Seating was ample though. 

Definitely worth another visit.

* update *
Just returned for a second run of their Restaurant Week deal. What I said before stands. Food tends to run a little sweet and salty. The chicken lollipop was good BUT REALLLLLY sweet/overpowered by the sauce. The filet mignon was well seasoned, but a little on the salty side. 

The food is pretty solid... and you can't really go wrong. The service this time was superb and on point. Overall win in my book."}
{"text":"Warm bread and wine.  The ginger nutmeg and cinnamon butter was tasty.  Mets are beating the Royals, we were off to a great start.   Then came the scallop sliders.  Perfect for a late and light dinner.  The size was just right.  Hawaiian tunes were a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"I went to Tommy Bahama (for the first time!) with my family for dinner last week.

The thing that stood out the most was the exceptional service. Our server was extremely nice and attentive. I absolutely adored her. I'm not even kidding, I wanted to take her home with us. 

The ambiance was very nice as well. The patio was cool and comfortable; a good place to people watch. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed eating inside as much. 

Of course, the food was excellent and the desserts are simply a must. I enjoyed the macadamia goat cheese, the crab-stuffed shrimp, and the pineapple creme brulee."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant a few times, years ago, and never had an issue. The wait staff is generally friendly and the food displaying a good spectrum of flavor. For Date Night, my wife decided to hit them up. The restaurant was dead as it was happy hour so what business there was had migrated to the Bar area with the live (but mellow) music. The Happy Hour menu is discounted, in some cases by five or six bucks, but pretty limited and with the appetizers being very scaled down versions (getting what you pay for).  Luckily, the few drinks offered are still very good. Try the \"Crazy Cuban\" and the \"Coconut Cloud\" for a sweet, boozy flavor profile! The portion sizes still waver between high-end snooty and fairly worth it though the food itself is hardly lacking. Though they no longer carry \"Blackbeard's pudding\", the dessert offerings are still quite delicious. If you're looking for something a little different with a relaxed atmosphere (You're already in Town Square so your wallet is expecting a dent or two), this fills that niche."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch because we wanted to try something different, some place new. Love the look of this restaurant.  I felt I was dining at a plantation house in the Bahamas.  Which is what they are going for. The bartender actually made a delicious Martini which is a dying art. My wife and I both had Crab Bisque soup to start.  Wonderful! My wife had the coconut shrimp appetizer for her main course.  (She is nuts for coconut) She said it was some of the best coconut shrimp she has ever had. I had the bacon burger which was delicious.  The service was just fine. The waiter seem to be busy else where in the back and would show up a few moments after I was started to wonder if he'd left. But it was still decent service just a hair slower than I've experienced at other restaurants.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how good the food was last night.  Ahi Tuna tacos a must.  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I usually like this restaurant because the food is good but the server I had threw away my food when I asked for a box and charged me full price when I asked for happy hour fish tacos.  I won't be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the macadamia encrusted goat cheese, so a friend and I went to indulge on this delicious appetizer, we get seated on the patio and from that point on get ignored, a waitress passed by three times and did not even give the courtesy to acknowledge our presence, even if it was busy (which it wasn't) a quick greeting would have been suffice. We too are in the industry so it's found to be even more disrespectful. I hope this opens the eyes to the staff about giving better service because we did end up walking out."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week during restaurant week with my parents, 11 month old daughter, my gf & her 2 year old son. We were seated promptly & we had the best service from Adam! He was friendly, up beat, accommodating, knowledgeable...from going out the night before & receiving horrible service at Bachi burger to receiving the best service from Adam. It was like night & day. Our drinks were always full, he helped me move chairs out of the way to fit the high chairs, our food was delivered in a timely manner. We never had to flag him down for anything. He even suggested we take our dessert to go if we were too full to enjoy at the restaurant. Thank you for being good at what you do & restoring my faith :) I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby & i went here for dinner before the JLo concert. The appetizers were great. Drinks were good. Entrees were ok, not the best but ok. Dessert flight of 3 cakes were good. I would go here again. Clean bathrooms, decent service, nice atmosphere. The courtyard outside the restaurant is beautiful at night. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I love this place.  Anytime I am somewhere warm I actually look for a Tommy Bahama's restaurant.  The food does not get any better than this anywhere!  The drinks are stellar as well.  The price, service and ambiance make this place an exceptional location for a nice afternoon lunch with friends or even a dinner date."}
{"text":"As a birthday treat, my friend took me out for lunch.  I hadn't had the pleasure of dining at Tommy Bahamas so let's go!

We were greeted and seated immediately.  The dining room is open and clean.  Our waiter was right over to our table.  He was very attentive and friendly for our visit.  Drinks were always filled promptly.  

A warm complimentary bread basket is brought to the table.  The honey cinnamon butter is great.  I could eat that all day long with that bread.  But I decided to order an actual meal.  The blackened fish tacos were delicious! The fish had a great seasoning. It's filled with tomato relish, chipotle aioli, lime sour cream and Asian slaw.  So filling and so worth it.  

When they bring over the dessert sample tray, it's hard to say no.  We split the piña colada cake.  You can order the half slice or full slice.  The half slice was plenty to share.  The vanilla cake had layers of pineapple, white chocolate mousse and toasted coconut.  I loved every bite.  Next time I need to try their pineapple Creme brûlée.  It looked so tasty.  

Since it's easy to find in Town Square, I'm sure I will be dining here again."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama's has a nice, relaxed and semi-formal vibe with delicious appetizers and desserts. 

My wife and I each felt our entrees were tasty, but we also felt we could make them ourselves with the right Food Network recipe! Considering each entree was in the $30 range (Ahi Tuna for me, Stuffed Chicken for her), we were disappointed overall.

So, my advice to any one pondering Tommy Bahama's for a meal, I say skip the sit-down dinner, grab a seat in the beautiful bar area, and enjoy a few rounds of appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Came in for Restaurant Week with Loren M. The $20 lunch menu features several of their best dishes, with a $30 evening/all day menu. Both seem to be a great value, with a large amount of food and several seafood options. Good spot to bring your pescatarian friend!

Caesar salad and chicken tortilla soups were solid, but the lollipop chicken and grilled artichoke apps were both very tasty with good dipping sauces. By the time we got our fish tacos, we were too full to eat them- trio of tacos with blackened fish (tialiapia?), on corn tortillas, served with plaintains and coconut cream. 

Save room for dessert- their peanut butter pie is a solid version but the Pina Colada cake is light and fresh and creamy, perfect for these hot summer temperatures! Request Phil or Pasha as your server- both are personable, attentive, and attractive!"}
{"text":"My family and i love Friday nights here, right after work, we all come together for Happy hour which is form 5 to 7 i believe, but we usually get there at the tale end of it closer to 6:30.  The Happy hour menu has some great dishes.  My dad love the Fish tacos, and the rest of us are shrimp fans.  It can BE VERY packed on Fridays when we go.  Get there early."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing. My first time here. I felt a little under classed with how fancy some of the other customers dressed and the ambiance of the restaurant was also nice but relaxing. I had some kind of sashimi style fish taco my wife ordered and it was probably the best fish taco I've ever had and I'm from socal!  I ordered pork belly fried rice and thought it was perfect. Probably about 1 1/2 cups alone of fried rice which being Asian makes me very happy. Not stingy on the pork belly cubes either. My mojito was strong which 
 the way I like it if I'm spending that much. My waiter gave great service with no problems and was always there when i needed something and made great recommendations and gave us plenty of sauces when needed. Price wasn't too expensive considering it's town square mall. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Excellent venue and very cool environment but idk if the food is that food. Crab bisque is delicious. Would go again, maybe only for happy hour and appetizers"}
{"text":"We enjoy the vibe and the food at Tommy Bahamas.  Its located at Fashion Square so the parking is kind of a pain in the butt unless you find an open spot curbside.  

There are two approaches to eating at Tommy Bahamas....Weight Gain or Weight Loss.  

If you are looking to gain weight with their delicious rich and savory menu selection, I would start by eating the bread with ginger honey butter.  If you like sandwiches, the cuban sandwich is very rich and tasty.  I also recommend the Grilled bbq spare ribs.  Decadent.  Chicken Tortilla soup is also very tasty

If you are looking to lose or maintain weight, they have a pretty decent salad selection.  Ahi tuna with Kale and mushrooms is pretty solid.  So is the grilled chicken salad.  

For those of you who are into libations, My wife loves the Grapefruit basil Martini.  Its a light drink that's not too sweet...perfect for a hot day."}
{"text":"Located in the center of Town Square, a convenient spot to take a break while shopping. Food are decent and staff are attentive."}
{"text":"Five stars to my latest experience at tommy Bahamas. Our bartender Kelly really made the afternoon perfect. She has the perfect personality for the service industry and our drinks were timely. But that's not all. This girl makes one helluva key lime martini! Our service was top notch and she handled herself like a true professional. The food was decadent, as always, and the happy hour music wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you. I always cringe when I hear the term \"live music\" but this was quiet, pleasant, and even enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back for happy hour and sitting at the bar so that we can have more of Kelly's FANTASTIC martinis!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak salad, great service, and generally the quality of food and service we've received at other Tommy Bahama Restaurant locations in Maui, Kona, and LA."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is awesome and the location is prime! Our host, Ron is very helpful and very enthusiastic. We ate here with my Mom and Dad who are in town from San Diego and they had a good time. With the help of Ron, coupled with his service and their delicious food, my parents had smiles of satisfaction and for a daughter, there's nothing more priceless than making your parents happy. 
I recommend this place to all who happen to be in Town Square. Worth visiting, indeed."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for lunch or dinner. I fell in love with their snapper dinner with rice and macadamia nuts. Probably one of the best fish dinners I ever had. May be too salty for some people but worked very well for me, especially with this fish. Reasonably priced too. My whole family enjoyed this place. While my friends come here for lunch for a reason. Nice atmosphere and great location too."}
{"text":"Fish Taco... You want the Blackened Fish Tacos.
I have eaten here 3 times. I'm a jerk and always get the same thing: FISH TACOS

But I have picked off other people's plates too. The steak salad is fantastic.
Service is good and we paced. It is honestly a bit pricey, but well worth it.

Also, FISH TACOS"}
{"text":"Dear Tommy Bahammas, today I cheated on you with Ale House and paid the price....  Undercooked chicken wings, tasteless food and poor service. I learned my lesson and promise to be faithful to you and my favorite bar tenders Katie and Brian.  

Yours truly,

Loyal customer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars.  Great atmosphere good music.  They had an awesome drink selection.  The food was very good and I felt it was a bit different which was nice.  My son had the ribs and my husband had the swordfish.  We had salads which were VERY good.  I ordered a side of risotto which was so good!  Now the problem .. The service was bad!  The only time we seen our waiter was when he took our order and brought our drinks.  Our appetizer came at the same time our salad and food came.  Not once did our waiter ask if we wanted another drink.  :(. Major bummer as it could have been so much better.  I had a reservation through open table at 4:30 so it was slow.  I would try again.. Maybe just a fluke!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Slow service during lunch on a recent friday while sitting in the bar area. Bartender was overwhelmed and the manager had to come out to take orders and help refill beverages. We waited close to 20 minutes from sitting down to having our order taken, and then 15 minutes after putting our order in we were informed the kitchen was busy and backed up and we would be waiting a little longer since out order was still 4 more to go. 
I had the fish sandwich and it was very good, but the bun was so soggy that it kept falling apart and I had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork."}
{"text":"I was here for a private party for Tommy Bahama retailers- cool bar and drinks were good.  Nice atmosphere!  The spread they offered was amazing!"}
{"text":"Chicken lollipops are the bomb.com.  Went with my daughter and everything was great.  The kona coffee crusted rib eye was decent with the warm potato salad.  Didn't care for the bread pudding but my little one loved it.  Good lunch while shopping at Town Square, love the beachy  feel."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good prices too, I get salmon salad was boom and the Cuban sandwich is boom to. I really love this place thanks . La comida muy bueno y los precios razonables , yo comí una ensalada de salmón súper rica y el sándwich cubano es uno de los mejores q he comido . Muchas gracias al mesero q nos atendió ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and good food! 

We started with the goat cheese and bacon jam crostini (yum, yum and yum). I would've liked a little more goat cheese and less bacon jam, but I enjoyed it.

I ordered the lump crab and avocado salad as my entree, which I really liked, except for the capers and onions which seemed strangely out of place. They didn't skimp on the crab, so I felt like it was hearty even though it was a salad.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you'd see I like a good bread basket. The bread here is served warm and with a cinnamon butter that pairs perfectly with it.

Their mango iced tea is also really good, especially during the summer! Because of the heat I can't handle sitting outside, but on a nice day, their patio is a nice spot to relax and people watch."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama is a good Caribbean-themed bistro with fresh dishes and bright flavors.  It's a little on the corporate side with it's ambiance, but the menu has a number of strong dishes.  

I'll admit that walking in the place, I was a little dubious.  The restaurant houses one side of the building and the other side of the building sells tacky J. Crew-style Caribbean clothing.  Doesn't really sound like the best place to find a meal.  But after a few dishes, I was won over.  

The tortilla soup was a huge winner with bright, fresh flavors and a nice spice.  Not over-the-top spiciness, but just enough to bring out the chicken and tomato flavors.

Coconut shrimp came across as fairly standard.  Not a real stand out dish, but I was impressed with the freshness of the shrimp.  

Also had the Jerk Chicken.  To put it simply, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and nice balance of sweet and tangy.

I'm not the biggest fan of the atmosphere--a bit too much corporate in this bistro for me--but the flavors were very good and the dishes all fresh.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food was good but not as hot as I'd like fish, rice and asparagus to be.  Good flavor and service.  Enjoyed a specialty drink. A little pricey. Unusual dessert looks.  Nice number of food choices.  Spicey butter was appreciated. Extra touches."}
{"text":"Dined here for restaurant week 2018 with my friend Jessie and my 19 month old son. They immediately brought my kiddo a kids menu with crayons and a working high chair! Our server Pascha was very friendly. We both ordered drinks from the bar and then looked over the menu. We chose this spot because they had two lunch menus, a $20 and a $30 with 3 courses; appetizer, soup/salad, and entree.

I went with the $20 menu and got the grilled artichoke, caesar salad and cuban sandwich. I had a hard time choosing between the sandwich or the tacos so I asked Pascha to surprise me. I really thought he would bring the tacos, especially since I over heard him tell another table they are a best selling item, but whatever. The grilled artichoke was delicious. It was grilled and had garlic butter and parmesan cheese on it, and it came with a yummy lemon tarragon aioli dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again. The salad was your typical ceasar salad, except instead of chopped lettuce it was lettuce leafs. The Cuban sandwich was okay, but really I think I would have preferred the tacos. It came with their island coleslaw and jerk yucca fries which were spicy! To drink I had the Kona Brewing Hula Hefewiezen which was yummy. Tasted a bit like Blue Moon but not as fruity. We also were brought warm bread and honey butter with our meals.

Finally it was time for desert. This was not included with the restaurant week special but it was $5 and I can't ever pass up dessert. I chose the pb pie and it was delicious! The crust was salted pretzel - yum. The pie tasted like a salty peanut butter cup. 

I have to mention I ordered my son the $7 chicken fingers with fruit and asked for ranch instead of honey mustard and the waiter said they don't have ranch. What?!!? I've never heard of such a thing. So fellow ranch lovers, take note! The chicken fingers were crispy and yummy and came with a side of fresh fruit. The boy was very happy as he gobbled most of it up.

I love restaurant week because it gives me a chance to try places I otherwise would not have. This is one of those places. I would for sure come back for a meal here."}
{"text":"The General Manager of Tommy Bahama Restaurants contacted me a couple of days after our experience.  We are dining at Tommy Bahama's Las Vegas Restaurant tonight.  I will certainly update my post.  Looking forward to a great dinner experience.
We ate at Tommy Bahama's 
It's always a good idea to give a restaurant a second chance.  We returned to Tommy Bahama's in TS.  We started with Happy Hour in the bar.  Fast, friendly service.  Well organized and staffed appropriately.  We had perfectly prepared martinis.
Bryan, a manager, spoke with us.  He is a friendly personable person.
We were seated on time.  The hostess took note of my request, (My husband is deaf). To be seated in a quieter area of the restaurant. Not that this restaurant is extremely noisy.  We had a very friendly, experienced waitress, Joanie.  Our wine was delivered promptly, by Dominica.  I think Dominica might be a manager.  Dominica was friendly, and knowledgeable.  Our food was prepared to perfection, and served hot. 
We loved our dining experience.  Everything couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"Yum!   Dinned on the Patio last nite,  was very impressed with the Chicken Lollipop appetizers, and  the Bread.......  oh my goodness it was was Soooo good,  the server gave us extra to take home .  The Caesar salad with Chicken perfect.   Will definitely  be back soon"}
{"text":"Being from out of town this place really is a great place the service was fantastic and food is excellent, will be stopping here every trip here and will recommend to all our friends."}
{"text":"Actually, this is one of the loveliest places for our family in Vegas. We usually come for Sunday brunch. Always have pleasant service and delicious food. I adore design and place is usually not crowded or loud. Good for families with kids, perfect for a date. And...desserts are...fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent establishment! Great team that works here that ensures every guest feels valued. I'd recommend this place for any occasion. They also have one of the best happy hours in town. Great for business meetings or date night."}
{"text":"This has been, by far, the best restaurant experience of our trip to Las Vegas. The food was excellent, the drinks were phenomenal, and our waiter, Anthony, was the absolute best! His suggestions were on point and he took care of us from the second we sat down. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Sin City!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome and food is delicious. I love the chill vibe and island theme. Reminds me of Boca Ratón Fl lols ...but serious I totally dig it"}
{"text":"Mediocore, okay, nothing significant about this place.

Tried out their happy hour cause my friend was fiending alcohol and cheap food. Well, the alcohol and food were cheap but it's small portions. Don't get too excited. 

Ordered ahi poke, madamia goat cheese, sliders and fish tacos. Seriously, after sharing those with my friend, I was still hungry. There are other happy hours in town where they serve a larger portion.

Also ordered a mojito and margarita. Eh, it's aiiiiggght."}
{"text":"Food quality and presentation was good. Prices are kind of high in comparison to food portions. Ask for outside seating if weather permits. Will be back when in immediate area."}
{"text":"It gets BUSY at Happy Hour! So be a nice, little, patient guest and understand that the staff is running their a***es off and will get to you as soon as they can. 

The live music was really fun and different. I loved the large selection on happy hour and as a first timer, I had a blast and will definitely be back :) Katie, our bartender, recommended the fish tacos and the goat cheese apps on happy hour. I got those! Yum! The regular guy next to me also ordered the blackened fish tacos and gave them high praise and a thumbs up to me in my wise ordering. My gf and I had a couple cocktails and personalized shots and we were then definitely inducted into the cool club. Lol. We went upstairs to Blue Martini for ladie's night, BUT I wish I had just stayed and chilled at Tommy Bahamas!!!!!Better service, more fun, delicious food, and a chill atmosphere at Tommy Bahama's I will tell everyone btw! It's a Town Square hidden gem.But, if you'd like to be carded a million times, pay more for watered down stupid martini and \"extra\" shaker drinks (BM) drinks, go to Yard House or Blue Martini. haha! Enjoy my photos and more to come!"}
{"text":"Hubby surprised me by taking me here for my birthday last week.  He had very specific parameters within which to work: 1) the restaurant had to be close to UNLV because I had to get back that night for a rehearsal, 2) the restaurant had to have good yelp reviews!, and 3) the restaurant HAD to have chocolate cake on the dessert menu (because I like cake and because it's my birthday!).  He found Tommy Bahama's, made a reservation just in case, and picked me up at the uni.  

What a lovely dinner!  The food was FANTASTIC.  Service was almost flawless; waitstaff forgot to bring our grilled artichoke appetizer before our main dishes.....BUT they comped the appetizer to make up for that oversight and gave me 3 free desserts because it was my birthday!  

Our dinner began with the bread basket and honey/cinnamon/garlic butter.  Warm, soft, crusty bread with sweet butter.  What's not to like?  The grilled artichoke was decadent and delicious.  For our mains, we both ordered fish: I had the the seared ahi tuna (YUM) and hubby had the black cod (again, YUM).  Portions were not huge; rather, they were \"normal\" sized and allowed us the stomach space to have a multi-course meal.  Desserts were perfect.  The chocolate cake was rich and velvety and indulgent, the key lime pie featured fabulous bright flavours that contrasted with the graham crust, and the pina colada cake was just plain good.  The waitstaff even sang \"Happy Birthday\" to me whilst bringing out my desserts.  How cute!

All in all, I never would have thought that a retail clothing store would house a hidden dining gem.  Would I come again?  Most definitely.  Thanks for a GREAT birthday meal, Tommy!  :)"}
{"text":"My parents held a reception/lunch there after their vow renewal.  The private room was so nice and bright.  The gal we worked with  (can't remember her name) was so nice and easy to work with.  The food was good.  They were super accommodating about setting up and doing a slide show and the cake.  Very reasonably priced for Vegas and great location at Town Square, close to the park so the grandkids got to run around and play after.  Highly reccmomended"}
{"text":"Our favorite waitress Becky told us to visit her at Tommy Bahama's for a great happy hour and amazing food. We finally went into the restaurant tonight not sure what to expect. First of all, we definitely under estimated the size of the space. The restaurant is much bigger than it looks from the outside and is a generally nice space. They had live music playing in the bar that you can hear throughout the dining room and the atmosphere was sort of romantic but still comfortable. We were very happy with the ambience.

We were happy that Becky was working tonight to help guide us through the menu. She convinced us to be adventurous with our food choices and I'm so glad she did. Without her I wouldn't have known how delicious Yucca fries are! I tried new things and even the simplest things, like my chicken sandwich were well above average. My only regret is that I wish I saved room for desert because those looked just as amazing as the food was! 

If you have walked past this restaurant with curiosity like we have, I strongly recommend that you check it out. The flavors are so deliciously different than any other restaurant and definitely a place you'll want to visit again!"}
{"text":"A true fine dining experience.  Rob, the manager, and our server Dominique provided and excellence service.  This was my first time at a Tommy Bahama restaurant as I didn't even know they were in the food industry.  I was truly amazed by both the service and the food.  I had the crab bisque and Thai shrimp and scallops, both were delicious.  One of the best meals I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Finally went for Happy Hour and it is now one of my favs! The closest you can probably get to feeling like your on vacay when you can't be.  The perfect weather did make such the difference. We had a table for 5 outside and it was perfect! The drink and menu options are great!  A small menu but a very good mix if things.

First round of drinks I had the sangria which the flower in it just gave it that little extra something to make you feel like you were on a tropical island somewhere...it's the little things!  2nd round was the basil martini which was delicious.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  I would have had more if I wasn't driving :)

Food was really good! My favorite was the macadamia goat cheese! Fish tacos and plantain chips were yummy too. I plan to go back and get the poke and the sliders, which others in my party said the sliders were really good, I was just too full! But always have room for dessert and when they brought out the dessert tray, had to try the creme brûlée in the pineapple.  Not only was it pretty and tropical looking but was amazing!  Never had that mix, glad we did and will definitely get it again!  We scraped the bottom!

I wouldn't have minded sitting inside because the guitar player Justin is amazing! I didn't realize he played there but saw him one day when I was passing through the restaurant.  He happen to be the musician I got to play at my sisters wedding. I saw him at a friends wedding and had to book him.  So glad I know where I can catch him play!

Town Square has many great happy hour options! This is up there in the rankings for sure! Such a great deal for the food and drinks you are getting!  Service is great and the outdoor patio is awesome for those perfect weather Vegas evenings!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas there are many party spots to visit. There are few places at which you can combine a cas and classy atmosphere, buying awesome clothes and having a perfect blue cheese stuffed olive Martini. This is it."}
{"text":"Came for our first time. Loved the crusted goat cheese. Then we shared the grilled Cobb salad with this amazing blue cheese dressing. Then our entree was the blackened fish tacos which we will be back for. Tried the pineapple mojito..which I'm sure some people would like but I didn't..but luckily Katey came to the rescue and made me a blood orange Margarita that was to die for. The pineapple creme Brule..which I'm pretty sure they killed someone for the recipe. We will definitely be back..but only when Katey is working since she can really make a drink and hold a good conversation."}
{"text":"This is our go to place at town square. The food is fantastic and the staff has been great every time. They seem like friends who remember what we like. I've been here about 50 times.
I usually sit in the bar area where they have live music on some evenings.
The regular dining area is also very nice. Makes you feel like you're in the Bahamas.
There's even an outside area that I belive is the nicest in all of town square.
I love the fish tacos, chicken lollipops, and just about everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Tommy Bahamas! 

This is our 3rd time here and it was on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. You MUST always get the Sangria, the red one. OMG its the best! 

I always get something different every time we go there, but everything is good like to die for. 

This is also a MUST try."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. I came for Restaurant week. It's was such a great deal for $20... I got an amazing tortilla soup, it was soooooo good. It's a must have. So much flavor. Then I got the Blackened fish tacos, one of my favorites at Tommy Bahamas. We got 3 tacos and on the side we got plantains with a pineapple dipping sauce with crusted coconut shavings! Wow! Then our 3rd course was a sampler of dessert chocolate cake, coconut cake and lemon meringue... Yummy! Ok so I am a big fan of Tommy Bahamas I have never been disappointed on anything that I've ordered there. 
Oh and my drink at Tommy Bahama is a Mai Tai also a must try. 
After all this knowing that I had a great lunch for restaurant week also felt good Tommy Bahama will be donating to three square!"}
{"text":"Super-cute little place, open, airy feel. Great decor. So tropically classy!
A local friend of mine took me here for lunch as she also wanted to show me the awesome shopping area it is in. We skipped over a super fancy place and chose this one - fancy in its own right but 'Florida-feel casual' at the same time.
Our waiter was really sweet - we got several wait staff helping us throughout our meal, actually. Some things took awhile like our waters and my coffee but overall, I liked our experience. 
I tried the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent and served hot. YUM! Little bits of sweet corn came on top. My friend had ordered an appie and a main and I knew that would be a lot for me for lunch but what the hell - I also got the blackened fish tacos. They were good - of course they do not compare to say, some you would get in Hawaii but they were quite tasty. I could only eat 1 out of 3 of them. Also on the side of the plate in addition to a lime, you get a little pineapple yogurt type dessert in a taco shell with beautifully fried plantains on top. OMG, I left full and of course I took my tacos with me!
My friend loved her lobster bisque as well as her chicken tacos and she too had a to-go bag!
My one comment would be that we had asked for all the dishes to come at one time but my soup came first and nothing else. Not even my friend's soup came so I felt a bit bad eating alone for a bit. But we said nothing and tipped very well.
Would love to go back next time I am in town, maybe for dinner sometime to see the mood of the restaurant at night."}
{"text":"Ask for Anthony!

We brought my parents here to celebrate my father's birthday earlier this week and we had a lovely dining experience all around. 

I should be talking about the food but, service first. We LOVED our server ANTHONY...he is AMAZING! Seriously, we dine out a lot and get a lot of sub par service. He went above and beyond my expectations as a server. Great personality, Great service. Very attentive and accommodating to my dietary needs. 5 Stars just for service seriously. 

Food was great too. I had Chicken Breast with broccolini. It was cooked to perfection. It was so tender & juicy. A nice change from my dried out home cooked chicken, lol 

Others at the table ordered Fish & Chips, Bacon Burger, Steak Salad. All meals were excellent. 

I'd definitely recommend Tommy Bahamas!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, good food. The staff really took time with us and made sure we were very happy. Even giving us a coupon for a free app/drink next time presumably because they found out we are locals. We got a pitcher of sangria and a local sandwiches for a late lunch and we had so much fun. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunched outside in the warm spring breeze. Lucked our way into Las Vegas Food Week so had to try the prix fix menu. The fried shrimp were crisp and delicious, burger was juicy and desserts top notch. Great place for a delicious but somewhat spendy lunch"}
{"text":"We had not been here for a few years. We were visiting Las Vegas from Dallas and thought we would check it out again. I think they do a very good job of making you feel like you are in Hawaii. Their lunch prices sure are similar to those in Hawaii. Although lunch is pricey, the food and service is wonderful.

I would suggest this is a great place to go if you are a visitor in town. If you are a local, what a great place for some wonderful Tommy Bahamas shopping and a nice lunch! The food selections and the service are fantastic."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from Austin and stumble into the Town Square shopping center just south of town on the strip. Couldn't have been more impressed with Tommy's. Sat outside during happy hour and had fish tacos and beer. Entertainment was good but a little loud. Service was outstanding.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pia was AWESOME, we were very well taken care of! The Happy Hour was great, prices from $5 to $8, and drinks from $6 to $8.

The patio was great, the weather just started to get good,.

FYI Happy Hour is in the Bar and Patio and goes till 7pm."}
{"text":"Major disappointment at this place.  Dishes were pricey and quality / quantity was low.  Maybe we just got very unlucky in the one time we've gone here, but safe to assume we have no plan to return.  I was very surprised to see a four star average here on Yelp.  So far as my experience, Tommy better stick to clothes (which I love BTW)."}
{"text":"What came first, the clothing store or restaurant? With how good the food was I would've guessed the restaurant but I was wrong! They serve solid food at higher than most prices (for the type of low key atmaphere)...but the portions are HUGE! I got a fish sandwich and the piece of fish extended out of the sandwich so far I basically got two meals. Everything is very light and fresh, I was impressed!"}
{"text":"Dear Allen -- I advise you NOT to come back for dinner.

We are big, BIG Tommy Bahama fans.  We have a house on Maui with lots of Tommy barware.  My husband owns tons of Tommy's Hawaiian shirts.  We were really looking forward to eating here after standing in line for an iPhone 3G for three hours.  (At least we finally got one.)  

We were seated promptly and taken our drink orders with dispatch.  That was almost the last we saw of our waiter without tripping him (and even that didn't always work).  We got water.  We were told there was no bread yet.  For appetizers I had the crab soup (OK, but not memorable) and my husband had the coconut crusted crab cakes (terrific, terrific Asian slaw with them).  Eventually we got bread, but it was so sweet (and so was the non-butter spread) that neither of us had more than a bite.  Does sweet bread make up for the bitter drinks?  The bar was backed up, so we had finished our appetizers before we got our drinks.  Maybe their Mai Tai mix had fermented.  Whatever, it was pretty ghastly and I didn't even finish it.  My husband had the Pelican Punch (Fruit Punch with not enough rum to speak of).  

My husband's main course was the Seared Ahi Salad (too much wasibi sauce on it for me) and I had the Chicken Salad Junkanoo.  What kitchen of any quality would send out a mess like this?  Consider some underripe grapes and unsweet orange slices surrounding a thick slice of toasted wonder bread (supposed to be Sourdough) with a couple of table spoons of watery chicken salad on top.  No wonder they had bread underneath the salad!  Something needed to act like a sponge for the dripping greens.  There was even an unappetizing piece of chicken skin in the salad.  My husband did want to try the Pina Colada cake that he saw on the dessert tray on the way inside, but after two tries to get more water (he got ice, no water), we paid in cash and escaped.  I don't think Tommy had this in mind for \"making your escape\".  Maybe other instances of this chain are better, but this was a disaster."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama has always one of the best Happy Hours in Las Vegas. We have come here about 15+ times over the years and still shines. Happy is from 4-7pm daily and on Friday evening they have live music. If you can score a booth even better and more intimate but you cannot beat the quick service when you sit at the bar.

Tonight we enjoyed a couple cocktails each the crazy Cuba 4/5, gimlet 4/5, coconut cloud martini 4/5 nice and strong and the Bahia Sangria 5/5, always delicious and great.

For our appetizers we enjoyed the world famous coconut shrimp 5/5 which comes with cole slaw and the fish tacos 5/5, simply delicious to the last bite. 

Thanks again Tommy Bahama's for another great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"After finding out the wait at another restaurant was 1 1/2 hours, we decided to check out Tommy Bahama's since they offer a gluten-free menu (my girlfriend is gluten sensitive) and we had not been there before. 

My experience was not all that enjoyable; while nothing was horrible, nothing was great either. We went at about 6:30PM on a Friday night and to our surprise, there was no wait. The hostess took her time and was in no rush to seat us - but she was nice. Once seated, the waiter had the same 'no rush' attitude and took his time greeting us.

We finally placed our order (I ordered the Cuban Sandwich w/ fries and my girlfriend ordered the Gluten-Free scallops). I was very surprised at the low-price of the scallops and couldn't wrap my head around the reasoning - until they arrived. First of all, the food was delicious. The portion size of the scallop dish was very small (2 scallops on some sort of salad). 

Our waiter spent very little time on us and it was very hard to get anything - and once the group of women arrived at the table next to us: that's all she wrote.

Overall - the food was delicious, but the serving sizes weren't great. Service was less than average. Environment was very noisy. 

I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice, the food was amazing and the Mai tai was probably the best mai ti I have ever had.   It was so good my friend and I each had two...I had the crab stuffed shrimp and the were AMAZING....my friend had the filet minon...it was cooked perfectly she said.  For desert we had the crème brulee which was served in a pineapple...great presantaion and great flavor.  I have eat at other Tommy Bahama locations and found them to be nice..but this location had excellent service and GREAT food...I am a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Did you know that Tommy Bahama's actually has a restaurant and bar??? Neither did I!

But I learned about it today when I was swinging through Town Square and I have to say I'm a fan!

Pleasant decor, in that Tommy Bahama caribbean kind of style. Ahi Fish Tacos were delish. Loved the Tortilla Soup. Prices were great. Side salad was fabu. Server Devin was pleasant and attentive.

Wish they had more locations so I could go more often."}
{"text":"What a great place to dine off the strip. Dinner has never disappointed at this restaurant. I ordered the Mac nut snapper and my hubby enjoyed the Cuban sandwich. We dined at the Waikiki franchise a year ago for our anniversary and loved it. We received a coupon in the mail for spend 100.00, get 50.00 off which was awesome. Unfortunately we couldn't eat or drink everything we ordered, so some of it was left behind. I did however manage to fly home our peanut butter pie.... which is to die for. Doug was our server and he did a fantastic job taking care of us. They treated us to a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was also very special. We will be back for sure!!!! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"First experience was a dessert run and it was amazing!  Went back the next day, New Years Eve, daughter and I had a great meal. I had the crab bisque for starters - it was so tasty my daughter ordered her a cup. HA!  Our entrees were fish tacos and fish & chips. Ooo. The bread and butter is to die for. Butter made with cinnamon, and ginger- delish! Over all the food was perfect!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Macadamia Nut Encrusted Goat Cheese was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Daily 4-7pm

Looking for a happy hour on a Saturday afternoon, we decided on Tommy Bahamas.  We sat in the bar area but they also have a nice patio.  For drinks my friend got a Grapefruit Basil Martini and I chose the Coconut Cloud Martini.  We shared the duo of chips.  I thought they came with plantain chips but they were just regular tortilla.  I ordered the HH fish tacos and my friend ordered the HH ahi poke and HH pork belly sliders.  We were happy with our food and service was sufficient.  This isn't my favorite happy hour in Town Square but a solid choice especially on a weekend where happy hours are limited."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food! I will be back for sure! All my friends enjoyed their meal as well.

The drinks weren't the best I ever had but they weren't terrible. 

Friendly service, I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm a liltte shocked that I actually liked this place considering that they are more famous for super cheesy  \"island attire\" (think Jimmy Buffett).  At any rate we were there for a private bday dinner for my mother in law and I have to say  that they made her day. The service was attentive, the food was actually good, and the sangrias were delic (maybe that's why the food tasted so good??). They also let her bring her own bottles of wine for the 30+guests there and had a wonderful huge coconut cake with candles for dessert. She was beaming the entire night and we all had a great time. Can't say what its like for dining in the main area, but for private parties its excellent..."}
{"text":"Late lunch early dinner, whatever you want to call it--it was so worth it!  The filet mignon salad was delicious. My friend had the crab and avacado salad and said it was excellent. Of course, how can you go without a bahama mama and a devilish dessert. All worth the stop. I'll be a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice, laid-back \"feels like I'm on vacation' ambiance. I would say this restaurant is more for adults versus it being kid-friendly. Semi quiet setting with dimmed lighting with a single candle lit on your dining table. This is definitely the opposite of say, Yard House on the opposite side of this restaurant.

Besides their regular menu, they got a small selection of daily specials too. We started off with a small cup of crab bisque. That was on the daily special. If I wasn't so body conscious, I would have ordered a bigger bowl!!! O_O lol! This was delicious! Very flavorful and creamy. Perfect for a cool, autumn evening. 

For entrees, my boyfriend got the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus) and I got the Crab Stuffed Shrimp (with Sautéed Spinach, Almond Rice, Thai Chili Sauce). See pics attached. We both enjoyed our dish a lot and would order this again. Good portion controls too. It was enough to get your comfortably full without making you feel like a fat lard walking out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The chef's specials are delicious. . We came early for dinner 4pm and it wasn't crowded.
Our server was knowledgeable and made very good suggestions."}
{"text":"Tropical delight!

Three adult diners and one child. We were greeted and did not have reservations but were sat immediately. We were met by a very friendly waiter who took our drink order and gave some healthy suggestions for my wooden leg. We started with the coconut shrimp (excellent flavor and not overly fried) and the crab bisque. Both are recommended and perfect servings. The bisque warmed me up while not being overly creamy. We finished with the Sanibel chicken, short rib dish and the blackened fish tacos. Each dish had a world of flavors and I would order each again and that's not the alcohol talking. Great location in town square great staff. Overall a pleasant meal and will return. Great for families too."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is one of our new favorites.  This is the first time we have tried this restaurant.  The atmosphere at the Town Square location was terrific.  It reminded us of Hawaii.  Luckily we were there during the early evening when it wasn't too busy.  I'm sure it get's packed with people later at night.

We shared a jerk pork tenderloin dinner.  I would recommend it.  The sauce they added was terrific."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and atmosphere and service were great. Grilled fish tacos and macadamia goat cheese were great, ahi poke and pulled pork quesadilla ok. I had a Mai Tai and a margy. Mai Tai was far too sweet, and the margarita just the opposite, far too tart. Next time I might stick to beer.

The decor is interesting, reminding me of a repurposed Ralph Lauren with monkey murals. It was very comfortable but I didn't get the island time feeling. For that I guess I'll go to Frankie's Tiki Room."}
{"text":"The ambiance left much to the imagination. Very loud and not so friendly staff with somber attitudes who couldn't recommend a dish or a drink. The fish tacos had some flavor but for 8 dollars the Poke looked like something scooped from a can. Most definitely not a happy hour and never a first choice for hangout. At least the drinks were pretty and delicious"}
{"text":"I love Tommy Bahamas! Everything tastes super fresh & has a twist on healthy meals. Fries made from a vegetable and not a potato? Ha! To go along with their paradise theme, their rum cocktails taste refreshing, yet not watered down. Prices aren't cheap, but reasonable. Their seafood tacos & ahi poke is delicious too. You have seating inside or outside, where there's the view of Town Square. You have music, lights, and servers who really know their menu. Come on a nice night with a designated driver!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The staff was exceptional and the food was absolutely delicious.  We were a party of 13 and every dish ordered was full of flavor, tender, and just phenomenal.  We were celebrating a surprise birthday dinner, complete with a cake, and the staff was so accommodating and wonderful, making sure we all had an enjoyable dinner.  I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a pretty big rum guy and well after finding out that almost no place in Vegas stocks Kraken Black Rum I was on the lookout for a cool hangout but not a bar that did. Well i found this place online listed as one of the best places to hang out, eat, shop, and get your rum fix of course!!!! So Tommy Bahama boasts a whopping selection of over 200 rums from all over the world and even has 2 bottles that are the only known bottles in existence so when they're gone they're gone.  I came in during happy hour (which is the best time to come by the way) to grab a nice Kraken and Coke and a bite to eat.  The place was pretty much empty save for a couple of groups of people so it was pretty quiet for the most part. The lady working the bar was immensely sweet and beautiful and she showed me the happy hour menu and gave me a few tips on how to save some money while eating.  
   I had both the burger sliders and the pork quesadilla and both were amazingly good. The burger sliders were a tad small but they were well cooked and flavorful.  The only issue with the sliders was the price differentiation from the quesadilla. The sliders were 7 dollars and you got less food while the quesadilla is 6 bucks. The pork quesadilla was recommended by the bartender and boy was I glad I took her advice. The quesadilla was  really well made and a pretty big meal considering it's very reasonable price (6 bucks like I said!). The quesadilla is served with a nice heaping side of mango salsa and is topped with goat cheese and beautifully cooked pork.  The happy hour was a highlight and I honestly will be coming back for the food and whenever I really crave some good rum. A word of advice though for any rum fans. So because they have over 200 different selections of rum, prices will vary depending on what you get. Cheaper rums (Captain Morgan, Bacardi, Sailor Jerry, etc) are right behind her on ground level while the really expensive stuff is above her with the whiskeys.  My Kraken Black Rum and Coke ended up costing 8 dollars which honestly wasn't bad at all and was pretty reasonable since it didn't tie into the Happy Hour. The only real con about the whole experience but not enough to deduct a star was the Happy Hour drink selection. Happy Hour really only covers a few wine selections, some rum concoctions, and really basic island drinks like a Mai Tai or Margarita. 
   All in all I really enjoyed my experience and the prices were not that bad. To show you how reasonable the prices were i'm a full time college student who is almost always broke due to tuition and I was able to eat at Tommy Bahamas lol. I was a bit afraid of the price because of the Town Square location but Tommy Bahamas offers really good food and drinks at a very reasonable price!  I definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes island style restaurants without the touristy feel that some of them have and also to people who want good food without the strip prices. This was a great experience and I will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"The service and ambience are classic Tommy's: A casual tropical vacation plopped down in the middle of a city--and it works so well. The Hostess set a tone of fun and light-hearted happiness.
Our server, Carrie M., was great and she gave extra attention to the dietary restrictions of our table mates.
The food was ok. The scallop sliders had too much bun for the thin scallops and the \"chips\" in the Fish and Chips we're loaded with pepper, effectively killing any flavor.
The ribs were perfect, as was the salmon.
This is not my first time at TB, nor will it be my last visit. I just wish I could have raved about it all this time."}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to try Tommy Bahama's mostly because we are really familiar with the clothing line and had never heard of the restaurant. And I'm so glad we went on this culinary adventure. I can not seriously think of a single complaint about my dining experience here... except that it might be a little pricey, but I definitely didn't mind as soon as I took a bite of the food!

Crab Bisque soup- Bring me a whole bucket of this soup because it is CRAZY good!! Super rich in flavor with lumps of crab- just the perfect way to start the meal. It was worth the $1.50 upgrade to get it.

Salmon salad- salmon crusted in panko on a salad with mango salsa all tied together with a Hoisin vinaigrette. WOW! This salad was light and refreshing. The vinaigrette was just perfect to balance the sweetness of the mangoes. And the salmon was so juicy and tender with the perfect crunch from the panko crust. It's seriously the perfect lunch dish! I would order this again in a heart beat.

Next time I'm in Towne Square, I'm definitely coming back to try their other delectable dishes!"}
{"text":"Comfortable, easy, always enjoyable. ZAYA is the sipping rum of choice. The Coconut Shrimp, Chicken Tortilla soup and the Salmon BLT are an absolute must!!!"}
{"text":"This could be a solid 4 for Happy Hour....but....the music is too loud and intrusive to be in the bar area...perhaps out in the patio would be better....The waitress we had was not professional but cute and tried her best....the manager was a joke....also not professional was just a A..H... personality...not customer oriented AT ALL. Happy Hour food and drink was good and atmosphere also good.....everyone was very nice except the manager....and the prices are appropriate"}
{"text":"First time visiting here and wow food is great! I'm visiting from CA for my birthday, what a treat!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Happy Hour. Enrique is the nicest guy working there. The food & the Cocktails are great. Thank you so much for your wonderful and professional Service. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Lets talk about THe FISH TACOS!  They literally are my fave!  I love the atmosphere!  Sitting in the bar, restaurant or the Patio, it really doesn't matter! Everywhere is awesome! They have great service and their bar is fabulous!  Outside of the Islands, some of the best Mai Tais I have had! 

Love Tommy Bahamas butter and bread as well! ;)"}
{"text":"We had never been here before but after trying their appetizers at a recent wine tasting, we decided to try it.  The place is very nice and the staff friendly.  They have a great bar and restaurant area.  The menu is nice with great Coconut Shrimp and Crabcake appetizers.  We had the fish tacos which were excellent.  They also have a great Rum drink menu to go along with lunch or dinner.  This was a fun experience and we will definitley return.
Happy hour is daily, 4pm-7pm, and is very good!"}
{"text":"My family really likes.this place. We always enjoy out meal. The Ribs are very very good, and the steak has good flavor. The service  was good and it has a really relaxed vibe. Parking is kind a pain, but not terrible. The bar had several  speciality drinks, and the price is well worth the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Always the best food and drinks in town....yes, even in Las Vegas where there are so many choices.  Pulled BBQ pork sandwich and bungalow salad are our favorites....along with the Mai Tais's and grapefruit martinis!"}
{"text":"I've been to many other TB's in other states. Always a consistently high quality meal, drinks and great staff. This location matched that standard and Carrie, my server, was great. This location was very quiet even though I ate an early dinner. Almost one on one service!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Met my parents here for a change while in Vegas and what a fun dining experience! It's beautiful and airy, and Town Square is a beautiful place to walk around. I got the fish tacos and they were light and delicious. Great flavor! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Easily the most forgettable meal ever! I thought we would try this place out and the restaurant is really nice and the service was great, but the food SUCKED. 

We went for lunch and hubby got the Cuban Sandwich and I got the rack of ribs.  The sandwich was very \"stock\".  Nothing made it stand out.  The ribs I got were soft, but lacking in flavor.  We also go the coconut shrimp appetizer which was great, but that was about it.  Even dessert ( Pineapple Crème Brulee) was underwhelming.  I really wanted to like this place, but $100 later..I was wishing I tried Brio or Kabuki.

It might be hit or miss because other diners really like this place..so maybe we just came here on a bad day. I don't think we will be back.  There are many other options at Town Square."}
{"text":"For lunch I stopped in and ordered: the iced Island tea (mango black tea with cilantro flakes and pineapple juice) which was refreshing and slightly sweetened. Their appetizer was calling me so I decided to give in and try the filet mignon flatbread (Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, crunchy bacon, crisp cherry tomatoes, tender filet mignon and fresh peppery arugula topping)! I left satisfied and looking forward to ordering this again for lunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tourist type prices and small portions of food. Soup was good but not much for the price.  Stuffed shrimp was over cooked and dry 

I'll take this one off the list for local places to go"}
{"text":"I've been to tommy Bahama twice and I LOVED it ever since. Restaurant is nice and clean. Servicer explained the menu well. So kudos for that! Basically I got nothing negative to say about this place \"yet\" (wink). Anyway, I will definitely come back again to try for some more food."}
{"text":"So, after the miserable service I received when I went to TB last month, I was ready to give this place another good-ole-College try before banning it from my list.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a totally different staff and fabulous service.  Our server, Anna, couldn't have been more energetic, helpful, efficient and eager to please.  Drinks and food were out reasonably quickly (but not too quick); no mistakes were made with the food; and when I asked for hot sauce, she had several options available and suggested I try a spicy aioli that she had the kitchen whip up just for me.  I had the fish tacos served with fried plantains again (oh how I wish there were more plantains!!) and couldn't have been more satisfied.  Well done, TB!!"}
{"text":"Class estlishment!  I've been bringing clients here for years and have nothing but praises to sing about this place.  From food to clothing Tommy knows how to do it right.  I love everything about the company.  They make the best chicken sandwich going and know how to dress it up  in class.  I would record Tommy Bahamas for anything form lunch to and formal get together with your favorite corporation.  This place is a classy joint and the food is to die for. Don't get me started on the service and world class cocktails.  I could go on forever.  Next time you're near a Tommy Bahamas you have to check it out. Yummy and awesomeness all around.  Keep up the amazing service and excellence in everything you do."}
{"text":"Meh.... $20 for a chicken Caesar salad is a tough sell even in town square. Too much good competion in the same mall for that."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere here. Very relaxed reminds me of good old Hawaii lol. Neways food is on point and so is the service!"}
{"text":"I walk inn after shopping and i have a couple of bags with me which are name brand bags some designers that some of us may know fyi im tiny n clearly need somewhere to put my bags i walk  over to bar too have a shot im happy ....then manager walks up jessica very rude and unpleasant do u just wanna seat here ..i say no her attitude got worse so shes now trying to seat me at a table for 4...just RUDE"}
{"text":"Love this.  I mean I LOVE it!  I haven't reviewed my past experiences, and it had been quite some time between the time I had tried it for lunch and my most recent experience, so this review is solely based on happy hour.

Good wine, delicious poke (I usually don't even like poke).  My friend ordered a cheese dip (or maybe I did?)  I thought it was hummus but super tasty!  The plantain chips were super yummy as well!  

Service was good, maybe a little too attentive.  Overall, I love the atmosphere.  It is very relaxing and I [almost] feel like I'm on vacation (until I keep checking my watch to see what time I have to go get my daughter from Artsy Nannies!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a guy named Tommy, who made it cool to wear linen pants and tacky flower shirts, could whip up some fantastic fare and amazing cocktails.

Service:  5/5 stars.  Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the food runner was on point, professional and efficient.  You can tell that the company cares about quality service and hires and trains the right kind of people to work here.

Food: 4/5 stars.  Don't let that reduction of one star discourage you.  That's reserved for knock your socks off kind of quality. This place is damn near close.  I had the crab bisque as I always do if it's on the menu.  The bisque was very tasty and was paired well with their fresh baked loaf of bread.  I'd prefer a little more \"meat\" in there just to make me feel better about the purchase; otherwise it was really good.  My main entree was the blackened fish tacos.  High quality white fish spread amongst three heaping tacos.  The meal was delicious once I scraped off the majority of the lime sour cream which the chef was a little over zealous with.  If I choose this again...\"sauce on side\".  The arnold palmers were flowing like Niagara falls in this place...I'd no sooner take the last gulp and there was another placed in front of me.  Was someone hovering behind me with one in hand at all times? Nope, they were just that good at anticipating my needs.

All in all this place is strong 4 out of 5.  I've deducted one star for the small points above and the fact that this place is not for the faint of heart, price-wise.   A dinner for two can and was easily 150 bucks.  Not for everyday (for me at least) but definitely on the list of 'must try again' in the near future."}
{"text":"This was suggested the other night while we were in Town Sq., I knew it was a chain, but had never gone in.

We had a blast! The food was great! The service was AMAZING! I was so pleasantly surprised and realized what I had been missing out on assuming it was \"just another chain restaurant\" 

Fun place that I would happily go to again when playing in Town Sq!! Maybe next time the Happy Hour, our waitress said it was the best deal in the Sq."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night for a quiet dinner. We had a great meal. Starter was the pulled pork quesadilla and it was delicious. For dinner I had a chicken cesar salad and my wife has the Crab stuffed shrimp. It was the best cesar I have ever had by far! The server Dominique suggested it would be best blackened and she was right. My wife enjoyed the shrimp immensely.  The rice was a little chewy but as soon as we told our server it was remedied quickly and the manager even gave us a free dessert or drink coupon for next time. We weren't even complaining we just wanted a replacement rice dish. The Sangria was delicious and really hit the spot. It was a great meal and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's not crowded. You feel like you're in the Bahamas. Everyone who works there is so friendly. The restroom is super clean. We had the nicest server. She wore pink and was so sweet to my infant son kept talking and checking on him. They even have a kids menu and I ordered him noodles. Our drinks were always refilled. I ordered the blackened fish tacos which came with plantains and this coconut creamy pudding in a tortilla chip bowl - so amazing. I wanted dessert but this sort of took the place of it. I would have rather have had a salad but I can't complain because it was so delicious."}
{"text":"Makes the work day better when some fabulous food comes I. The door.  Chicken lollipops. ..coconut cake..plantain crispy with cinnamon. .yummy lunch thank you... will be at the store soon for the full menu"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square, this is a really nice restaurant.... not super fancy or pretentious yet not just a bar or hamburger joint.  It's the perfect happy medium of nice and upscale casual.

LOVE, LOVE their coconut shrimp.  Not bready at all.  Big juicy shrimp, butterflyed and coated with coconut shreds... lightly fried ....NOT greasy at all.

They have a number of grea fish entrees so if you would like a nice fish dinner... head here.  (However, it's NOT cheap... so plan on paying a few bucks.)

Ambiance is tropically but not \"beachy\"... it feels like a nice resort.
They do have patio seating so if it's nice outside definitely try to get an outside seat so you can people watch.

Also, if you are looking for a place to host a party like birthday, retirement, baby shower, bridal shower, etc.... ask about their back room.  It's behind the bar and totally private.  TB does a really nice job with private parties so I recommend it.  (Just attended a baby shower there and it was beautiful!)

Desserts.... ALL of their desserts are decadent.  I particularly like their coconut-pineapple cake.... light and heavenly ...  am hoping it doesn't stay on the hips too long."}
{"text":"We arrived about 15 minutes before closing and they seated us and service was still very good. Everything we ordered was fresh and very tasty. The ahi tacos were crispy and well presented , the ceasar salad with shrimp was plump, and the seared ahi was crispy and a big portion,  tortilla soup was also tasty. The huge chocolate cake was also very rich and tasty and well worth sharing but the pineapple creme burlee was to die for. Very creamy and tasty with the pineapple. We want to go back again but won't have time"}
{"text":"We usually go see Brian at the bar. He is charming and fun. And he makes the best drinks! Chill ambiance. We had a round of drinks which included the Pineapple Paradisio, Cucumber Smash, Mango Habanero Margarita, Cantaloupe Martini.

The Mango Habanero Margarita is my favorite drink here. I loved it so much I tried making it at home. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't thank Tommy Bahama enough for making the Wisconsin Alumni Association Las Vegas Chapter's inaugural Founders' Day speaking and fundraising event a smashing success! As president of our chapter I was charged with securing a venue for us. After getting the runaround, headcount minimums and various other nickel-and-dime tactics from half a dozen other Las Vegas restaurants, I was fortunate enough to be recommended to Tommy Bahama. Tommy is on top of his game! From Kaaren - who was the most accommodating and responsive event coordinator I have ever worked with - to Adam, Amanda, Jason and the rest of Tommy's front-line team, our hats are off! No one went thirsty throughout the evening - a very tall task to tackle when you're dealing with folks from Wisconsin! The food was superb, as was the setting. If you are looking for a place that is reasonably-priced to have a very nice event for 40-60 people, I don't think there is a better option in Las Vegas. Thank you again Tommy for a wonderful customer experience - you get a 10 on the Net Promoter Score from the Las Vegas Badgers!"}
{"text":"A sweet fellow Yelper treated me to a birthday lunch here and man.. I was a happy camper.
I love the openness of the place and the decor is so light and airy. I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical. The tables and booths are spaciously spread out as to not have that on top of the other table kind of feel. There is a nice banquet room for special occasions. A separate bar area to keep those rowdy sports fans under control. :) The patio would be an awesome place to dine during pleasant weather. Service was friendly and attentive. I felt like our server Brandon was really happy helping us with our meal. I even got a candle in my pineapple creme brûlée which was nice. The menu prices were a bit high, but I felt like eating there and paying those prices- you get what you pay for in a very good way. So if you have a special occasion or a loved one that you want to treat to a great dining experience, I'd say give this place a try."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place, and I so desperately wanted to be.  Here's how the experience went down:

We walked in and the place reeked of pineapples, more than likely to set that tropical mood.  FYI: islands don't smell like pineapples, but whatever.

We were seated in a booth, which was nice, and our server took our drink orders right away.  We threw in some appetizers and 10 minutes went by before they come out luke warm.  The plantain chips, which I expected to be fresh from the fryer, were ice cold.  Oh well.

The food itself took 20 minutes to come out, which is way too long, even with refills of the bread basket.  By the time the food came out, I was full, but I tried it anyway.  The cuban is good, not great, and the other items my friends' bought: pork sandwich and jerk chicken were disgusting.  I don't eat things that look as if someone chewed it up and spat it out.  Presentation wasn't there, but it's not a 5 star restaurant.  All I ask for is good food, and the stuff they use in their sandwiches for the pork's bbq sauce and the jerk seasoning was too sweet and tasted very commercial.  Not for me, or them.

Overall, nice place to spend 12-15 bucks on a sandwich, but not worth the price tag.  I'll never eat here again, no matter how decent the appetizers were."}
{"text":"Had their coconut shrimp-appetizer...Good 
2 artichoke appetizer...to much butter-ok
Food, Mahi mahi-good 
Waiter , very slow....he was more attentive in the beginning and forgot his table and had to ask for more coffee and his manager had to pick up our plates...his name Doug...would have got a great TIP, SAVED ME MONEY THANK YOU DOUG"}
{"text":"I gave Tommy Bahama an opportunity to improve on my previous experience and they succeeded in spades.  The service was excellent.  Our server, Domonique, was very knowledgeable about the menu, she made a few recommendations that worked out very well. The first recommendation was for a spiced sangria that was so delicious.  Dominique was genuinely friendly and her service timing was excellent.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  There was live music in the lounge that we really enjoyed listening to during our meal.  

All in all, Tommy Bahama did a great job. Full Disclosure: the regional manager reached out to me about my previous experience.  I am impressed that Patrick cared about the issues and pledged to provide some training for the staff.  I am confident Tommy Bahama is a business that strives to learn from their mistakes and continue to strive for excellence. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a large party and I was very surprised on how well the waiting staff was able to take care of us.  My water glass was never empty for very long and the food all appeared to come out as one whole.  Nothing worse then watching someone else in your party eat while you are still waiting.  We started out with the chicken lollipops and the chicken was nice and juicy and the dipping sauce that came with it my wife really enjoyed.  My wife had the Parmesan Crust Snivel Chicken, the chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce that was served with it was to die for.  It came with a side of mashed potatoes which where very creamy and seasoned well.  I had the Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs, I only got a half rack but the ribs seemed very small and didn't have a lot of meat on them.  The BBQ sauce on them was really good tho.  My mashed potatoes seemed to be sitting out for to long and had a very dry taste to them.  I even put my potatoes next to my wifes and you could see mine had a brownish tint to them.  Over all we enjoyed the food I just wish they had some consistence in the food because I really did enjoy my wifes potatoes.  I think that the quality of food didn't rise to the price that they where charging."}
{"text":"Great tasty high quality cocktail, food are decent, but over priced besides happy hour."}
{"text":"Scallop sliders! Enough said, great option for some quick clean protein while at town square waiting for that Genius Bar appointment"}
{"text":"This review is for the Happy Hour, which we noticed when cruising around Town Square.  We were attracted by the 7pm closing, since we like to go to Callaway's driving range late in the afternoon, then have a snack.  We loved getting a booth for seating, and thanks to fellow yelpers, ordered the fish tacos, which features crispy small edible portions of fish..delicious.  I got Margaritas, fresh and salty, perfect for sipping while listening to the live music played by a creative guitarist singing his own tunes.  My beau enjoyed the pork tacos, and we split delicious jerk chicken lollipops, which were nicely spiced!
The total tab was under $40.00, and we tipped the guitarist $5.00 for his beautiful serenade!"}
{"text":"We live in Las Vegas and eat at many restaurants and Brendan the server there is one of the best servers we've had in quite some time we highly recommend this restaurant and if you get a chance ask for Brendan as a server , The food is very fresh and excellently seasoned and the combinations are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy for happy hour.  My favorite is the Tuna Poke app and the local brew hefeweizen.  Our bartender Kelly was friendly and provided great entertainment!  Her pleasant attitude made it a great night out.  Definitely ask for Kelly, she's the best!  There is also live entertainment with a great voice."}
{"text":"I'm usually not this harsh on a review but I'm not going there again.
Ordered tortilla chips and guacamole as an appetizer. $10 and a very small serving. Not worth it!
I had the beer battered fish sandwich. After 3 bites I already knew my stomach was going to be giving me problems. It was literally dripping oil. Every bite felt like a spoon of oil. Couldn't finish the sandwich. That's saying a lot for me."}
{"text":"The menu was small. Food is over priced for what it is.  It's all over the top seafood.  Sometimes a little less is more.  It's like putting lipstick on a pig."}
{"text":"I've always appreciated how fun this place is. Great food and drinks, but dining here during the day is another experience. A little too laid-back for those of us who have a limited lunch hour. Why is it always the \"other table\" has the fun waiter that is attentive to service? 

Food was delicious (when it finally arrived), and as always, the fish tacos were great. Be careful of filling up on the fresh, warm bread and cinnamon butter while you wait for the main course.  Obviously this practically became our meal while we waited for our waiter to stroll over with our lunch.

If you truly want to experience this place at its best, try the late afternoon, early evening when the sun dips and people are darting in and out of the various stores close by. Great place to meet with friends and sip mojitos."}
{"text":"I had the amazing tuna tacos, garlic artichoke, lollipop chicken, scallop sandwich.   These appetizers were so good I wanted more but I was so full.  I am an appetizer guy and these are close to the top of my list now.   The help was so nice which made my experience even better."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR EVERY FREAKEN DAY!! 4-7
LIFE IS ONE LONG WEEKEND

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #1**

The way to start a new year is by thinking of how you ended the year before.

I will start off by saying that I can FINALLY write a review for this darn restaurant now that I no longer am employeed by them. I have dedicated 5 years of my youth to this place & it has been the most AWSOME years of friendship w/ co-workers along w/ life long regulars who have become my friends. 

The atmosphere for this place is very mellow & relaxing. They have live performers from Tuesday- Saturday during dinner time. You get the whole Caribbean vibe starting from the bamboo host stand to the sea shell ceiling lamps. BEST time to go eat & really enjoy your RELAXATION time is during the spring when all the SLIDING doors open up & make you feel like you are dining outdoors whether you sit inside or outside.

FOOD is always the best of quality & if not the best to your standards... they do their very BEST to make you HAPPY even if they know you are wrong... they want to make your experience the best they can. I guess that is the power of a CORPORATION. The MONTHLY SPECIALS are seriously a HIGH recommendation as they are created by the ACTUAL executives chefs on site & not by the corporate Chef Don Donly ( don't get me wrong... he busts out some awesome dishes) but the point is that the menu will ALWAYS be there but the specials will never be seen again typically. 

The service is great, each individual server has their own style of serving but they all do the basics. So if one server isn't your fit, then just nicely ask for a different style of server. I BELIEVE this is kind of true throughout the restaurant industry but if you want fast cocktails.... eat at the bar.... if you want to wine & dine & have someone manage your meal for you so you don't have to think much after a hard day's work... then sit in the dining area. 

ALL in ALL this place is like your second kitchen. Fresh food so you can take leftovers & reheat it & it still tastes good. You can pretty much eat this place everyday & probably not get sick of it since I did it for 5 years."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING VEGGIE BURGER. They make them fresh daily. Packed with beans, rice, corn and spices. It was so delicious I had to write a review ASAP. I think it was $12.99 and included a side of fruit and either a simple salad or cup of soup. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. Everyone knows how hard it is to find a decent veggie burger that's not just a frozen patty.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA#8M4591pmudsTKD6IhLwd-A

The service was meh. He redeemed himself towards the end, but gosh it was awkward when our server took our food orders and then messed up the drinks. Maybe he had a hangover or a hemorrhoid flare-up. Got me. 

FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying. 

FYI Take Two- Be careful of the palm tree outside the door. I swear it jumped out and stabbed my boob when no one was looking. Glad it wasn't my eye, but still not the kind of physical relationship I want to have with a palm tree. Like ever.

Solid 4 Stars, easy."}
{"text":"Saw a sign last time we were in advertising a \"Chef's Table\" night, so we decided to try it out this week.  First the servers, and chefs were awesome!   
   Food wise,
       We started with a Scallop Appetizer with lobster succotash, Corn, and edible flowers.  This was insanely good, and really really beautiful.  I would order this if it was on the menu. 
       Next course was a Crab and Shrimp Salad with citrus sesame dressing.  This had tomatoes, avocados, shaved asparagus, and HONEYDEW.   I actually thought it was apples instead, But either way, EVERYTHING on this dish played an amazing part.  The sesame was perfect, the creamy avocados, the shrimp cooked just right and the right size, and the honeydew added a perfect sweet bite to balance it all.  It was amazing.
    Entre Course was a Filet Oscar.  This was my least favorite item.  The quality of the filet seemed lower quality, and mine was overcooked.  My wife's was cooked better, and she enjoyed it slightly more.  I have had better Demi Glaze. and Bearnaise. 
    Dessert.  This was not great.  There was pineapple that was too hard to cut without a knife(and we didn't have knives for this course). and the tarts were overcooked(Hard) and not real flavorful.  I am guessing that none of the chefs focus on pastry.  I would recommend instead of doing 4 items mediocre, to focus on one GREAT tart, maybe a chocolate tart with raspberry sauce and some fresh quality RUM macerated fruit(Sticking with the theme!).  But just do this one item perfect!  Especially since you leave people with this last taste, it needs to shine as good, if not better than the rest of the meal.

Food-wise, My Biggest criticism is that every bite of crab I had all night, which was on the first 3 items, had shell in it, and the steak being lower quality meat.  I personally would have been happier to pay $20 more and had slightly higher quality ingredients for these few items.

Drinks- First, they start you with a Rum Drink that was awesome.. even if you don't buy any drink pairings, this is included in your meal and was really great.  Then they pair either wine or Rum drinks to your meal.  I got Rum and it was well worth it.  I liked some, didn't like other, but it was matched well and I enjoyed that aspect of the meal.

Value-I felt this meal was excellent value.  I do think I'd pay more for slightly better, but understand why some people would be turned off to pay more, so I understand there is a marketing spin there. 

Then I leave it with the people.  We met some great people and had some excellent conversation all night and till we essentially got booted out, but it was the cherry on top.  Really enjoyed our time and cannot wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant food so good and pet friendly (service animal) also drinks is nice too. Inside there's have shop for shopping. Table area have inside and out side."}
{"text":"My mom and I went for a girls day out...I had the Seared Ahi Salad  and she had the fish tacos. The food was WONDERFUl and our waiter John was AWESOME. I will have to take my husband next time on a date night.

Really good food."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. The food is delicious but a little pricy if I didn't have the deal going on. The coconut shrimp are perfectly fried and nice sized meaty shrimps. I had the crab bisque it was creamy and had big lumps of crab and had a great flavor. They also brought out fresh hot rolls with sweet butter, those were fantastic. I enjoyed the fish and yucca fries. The fish had a great crispy coating without greasy aftertaste. The staff was really attentive and friendly. To end the meal I had the key lime pie. I loved it with really good whipped cream. The staff gave me a postcard they said they will send out and pay the postage which was a really nice touch. The decoration in the restaurant is cute and islandy. I really enjoyed the mai Thai and I will come back here again even without a special deal on the food."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama at Town Square provided us with a really surprising and fun dining experience.

We were looking for somewhere new to eat and decided to give this place a try. The giant billboard featuring a mouth-watering slice of key lime pie had been calling me for well over a year now, so tonight was the night to finally make the short drive to Town Square.

Upon arrival at the restaurant I was immediately struck by how friendly the staff were. I didn't get the name of the girl who greeted us, but she was extremely welcoming and let us know that our server, appropriately named \"Tommy\", was excellent. She was certainly right. Tommy was friendly, sharp, congenial, accommodating - everything you want from a waiter. He gave us lots of good advice and engaged us in conversation about the food, ranging from the bread with honey-cinnamon butter, to the excellent lemonade we ordered. He really seemed to have a passion for the menu items and did a great job of at least appearing to delight in our enjoyment of them.

I ordered the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the Antigua Quesadillas appetizer and a variety of sides to share with me. We both loved our food and were particularly taken by one of the sides, the enormous basket of plantain chips, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served with a black bean, charred corn salsa with lime sour cream.

Around halfway through our meal the idea of eating the key lime pie that had lured us there in the first place began to look like a bit of a pipe dream - but we were so happy we decided, what the heck. Two slices to go.

Overall our experience here was wonderful, particularly helped by the pleasant outdoor dining section and the lovely early April weather. My only minor criticism of the place is the lack of any real vegetarian \"main\" option for my wife. She was more than happy with what she had, but a little variety would call us back all the more often. That tiny gripe aside, Tommy Bahama was the complete dining experience for me and everything that is good about a meal out. We will be back."}
{"text":"Can you say Happy Hour! Yep.....it's good here and reasonable. Variety of wines $5-7 and food snacks which were all great. Reasonably priced 4-7pm everyday. Service- excellent bartenders."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a party of 8 to celebrate our daughter's 13th birthday at 1:30pm. The staff did a great job handling staggered arrivals, varying courses (3 of us ordered from the four course Restaurant Week menu, 3 from the kids menu, etc.) Everything was going great until the main course was over. It took literally half an hour for dessert to come out and imagine how awkward it was to present three desserts as part of the Restaurant Week menus but nothing for the birthday girl. Our server scrambled to get to dessert tray and we ordered one for her. We all shared bites of the Restaurant Week desserts while we waited for hers to come out. I ended up leaving my credit card with the rest of the party because I had to get back to work after a lunch that took almost an hour and a half. It started out so well but fell so flat that I felt compelled to post this review. Go only if you aren't in a hurry and especially don't go if you are celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"I went to Tommy Bahama for lunch with a friend. The food was amazing. I got grilled chicken mango salad and it was so delicious with the special vinaigrette. The mango ice tea is very unique here and it is a must to try for. The ambience reminds me of Hawaii or someplace tropical. Overall, I highly recommend this place for locals and visitors to try out. I"}
{"text":"I just ate here after I said yes to the dress next door at Viero Bridal! Tommy Bahamas was right next door and we decided to give it a try! The staff was excellent and were so very attentive. The manager Karen is literally the sweetest human ever and treats her guests like all restaurants should! She was so happy that I had found my wedding gown and gave us a free dessert. She personally came to ask how we were doing throughout our lunch. Our waiter Doug was amazing as well and knew everything about the menu and helped us decide what we wanted to eat. Everyone had a big smile on their face and the food was delicious! I had the crab bisque and it was amazing! So much flavor and just the right amount! Don't even get me started on the bread fresh out the oven and the sweet butter that goes with it! It was some of the best bread and butter I've had when out to lunch! Then our dessert, the pineapple creme brûlée was the best I've ever tasted! I will definitely be going back and make sure to ask for Karen and Doug! They are amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband went here, not planned. It just happened to be happy hour!  The happy hour menu was excellent. We tried almost every appetizer.  Staff and service was wonderful. Atmosphere Felt very Bahamas, lot of what seemed to be regulars at the bar with their Bahamas shirts and floral dresses, blouses.  A little dressy casual and totally relaxing with tad romantic for a couple. Good eats!  Will be back to sample more main dishes! I meant to take a picture of the food but got too excited and forgot. Managed to get a pic of our happy hour draft and bread... will do better next time!  Lol"}
{"text":"Overall tommy Bahamas was a good experience. I went for my girl friends work Xmas party. All the food was great. For an appetizer it was an amazing lobster bisque. I had a filet with asparagus and mash potatoes for my main course. For a large party of almost 100 the staff pulled it off relatively well except for a few miss communications. Ordered were laid out by little name tags in front of where we were sitting. So the servers seemed to run around looking for who had what. Besides that everything was great. I will be back again to try the restaurant on a smaller scale and really put it to the test."}
{"text":"You know, I was expecting more when I went here, but I was satisfied. This place is inside the Tommy Bahama Store in Town Square which is ideal, and I think it's a hidden restaurant but it's incredible. Good food with what seems like high quality service and quality food. I definitely recommend trying this place if you're new to Town Square, but it's not the cheapest place there. It's expensive personally, but the quality of food makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My go-tos are the Chicken Mango salad, goat cheese appetizer and coconut shrimp appetizer.  Eat here at least once a month and the food and service never disappoint.   Keep up the great work! :)"}

{"text":"Had lunch with the Family today ...Had the All American Burger medium rare ,the only thing that really stood out were the pickles a little sweet and salty , nice crunch  meat had no flavor to it . ahi tuna taco were probably the best thing i had there.... and the service was excellent very attentive... probably  will come back and check out the happy hour..."}
{"text":"Great selection of clothes - bought three ultralight jeans for summer wear, and three silk shirts - will be back for more - they have excellent selection - nothing like the stores I've seen elsewhere -ex. in Canada (where I'm from - they don't even have various pant lengths but offer to hem for free (regular price) or for $10 (sale price pants).  I will be back to shop here often the staff was very helpful (I was in a hurry) and they knew their merchandise really well. It's not cheap - a pair of jeans is $98+ but I'm comparing them to designer jeans that are less comfortable and twice the price. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour finally! Been dying to try the lollipop chicken, but it was taken off the happy hour menu. That's ok cause it was still a reasonable price. The lollipop chicken had a good spice to them. It was delicious. My friend and I also ordered the poke and the pork pulled quesadilla. All of it was delicious. We sat in the bar area where the booths are. Our server/bartender Chris, was awesome. He was attentive and nice. I asked him what he suggested and he said the lollipop chicken and the poke. The poke was tuna with avocado with a side of chips (wonton skins fried). It's great because the last time I was here, chris made some awesome drinks. I love how the service is consistent and always warm! Will definitely be back to bring more friends."}
{"text":"This was mine and my husband's first time and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was good and the service was great. It was a little on the pricier side and portions were small but again, it was delish! 

The setting was beautiful and I would love to sit in the patio the next time I go back and look out to Town Square. As far as drinks, I had a holiday special (can't remember the name) and my husband ordered an ale...can't complain! I also plan on going back for happy hour."}

Crab bisque 4.0
Ribs 3.5, side of slaw 1.0- blech oily and too many onions
Pina colada cake 2.5- boring, nothing special and the portion was half the size of the slice shown on the dessert tray
Atmosphere 3.5. The seat cushions need replacing. Dirty and worn."}
{"text":"Had to hit this place up as one my clients told me the coconut shrimp was a gift from God. Indeed the coconut shrimp was quite a treat.

Moreover the breaded chicken stuff entree I had was the highlight of my tastebuds. Thanks to the server my palate was pleased with what the Tommy Bahama Restaurant had to offer. 

I will be back and yes, we will order another couple appetizers of the coconut shrimp.

Thanks Natalie and company!

Cheers,

{"text":"This might be my favorite chain restaurant. Sure, it's kind of cheesy and it's attached to the Tommy Bahama store which has stuff I'd never wear (at least not for the next 25 years). But, I've been here a couple times now and everything I've tried has been tasty. 

During my last visit we got the scallop sliders ($11.50). There were 2 scallops in each slider, with a good bit of spice from the chipotle aioli. They've not your typical slider, but tasty nonetheless.

The Saba steak salad ($17.50) was also delicious. Plenty of tender, well seasoned steak over a salad large enough for two. It also had some grilled slices of potatoes, tomatoes, and a tamarind vinaigrette.

They also have a kids menu. My son is so predictable. He always goes for the chicken tenders. They're lightly breaded and the skinny fries are excellent

With drinks it came out to about $60. Yeah, a little pricey for lunch. From what I hear they have one of the biggest collections of rum around. So, if that's your vice stop by to check it out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly pretty good! I walked in, smelled coconut everywhere, and just had to have a piña colada. But by no means was it cheesy or tasteless. The waitresses were super nice, the food was really filling, and drinks were good too (disclaimer .. I had a virgin pubs colada). I would recommend the seafood dishes. I had the fish tacos and could barely finish my plate. And the fried plantains were accompanied by an interesting sauce (maybe a little too sweet).. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"\"If you like pina coladas...\" As I do, then head over for happy hour at Tommy Bahama's in Town Square. I usually frequent Yard House and Miller's Ale House to get my half priced drink on so Tommy Bahama's was a refreshing change of pace. It is from 4-7 pm everyday and offered only in the bar.

The bar was super crowded and it's easy to see why. We tried a few appetizers such as their ahi poke, chimichurri sliders, calamari noodles and fish tacos. Everything was delicious! My favorites were the sliders and fish tacos. Portions are rather small - the ahi poke was like amuse bouche - but the quality of the food made up for it. Prices weren't too bad but it adds up quickly since I wanted to try pretty much everything on the happy hour menu.

There was a musician who sang and played acoustic guitar. His melodic voice almost made me think I was on vacation.  I would definitely come back to try their regular menu and for some more pina coladas."}
{"text":"I went to Tommy Bahama's Restaurant at Town Center couple time with my best friend for lunch. I was really like the decoration and the foods are amazing. My favorite dish is Crab cake. The sause that they used on crab cake dish is diffrent from the other restaurants. Its like the asian sweet chilli sauce and olive oil with a little bit lime juice. Icouldn't stop dip on the sauce. I also like ceasar salad. It's very good size for lunch. The server was very nice and cute. I always stop there when I go shopping with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"We had the roasted vegetables, Bronzino and the stuffed shrimp.  Foods presentation and taste was very good.  The server there was amazing.  Prebussed our plates and offered suggestions to assist us with our meal choices.  She refilled my Arnold palmer 4 times with a smile.  I wish I remembered her name but did tell Mgmt how good she was."}
{"text":"Today was one of the restaurant week, this is what I ordered and they were amazingly good. For appetizer:MACADAMIA NUT ENCRUSTED GOAT CHEESE:
Mango Salsa, Sweet Soy Glaze, Flatbread; Entree:MACADAMIA NUT ENCRUSTED SNAPPER:
Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus; Desert: Piña COLADA CAKE:Myers Dark Rum, Pineapple, White Chocolate Mousse, Toasted Coconut. Everyone else that came to have dinner had a good time and enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Safe to say we will not ever come back here.  I can forgive a very long wait for the meal, especially when the assistant manager comes to your table and apologizes, telling us to save room for desert cause it was going to be on her.  After the long wait the LAST thing we expected was my 4 yr olds chicken fingers to be raw in the middle.  The most frustrating part was the apparent indifference the server showed other than to take our meal, and not even bother to ask if maybe she might want something else or a fully cooked plate.  Then when the check comes only one desert was comped along with a $8 chicken refund.  Called for the manager who did adjust the rest of the deserts off and said \"I made some other adjustments there too\" as he apologized.  Review of the bill shows only desert and chicken comped no \"other\" adjustments.  Very disappointed to have our Mothers Day dinner turn out so horrifying!  I mean come on RAW CHICKEN!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the crab cakes to start and they were delicious. I really enjoyed the Thai sauce that they were served with.  I ordered the crab bisque and it was amazing.  My husband really enjoyed the baked fish tacos.  I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Town Square."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service is great, but the place lacks the vibe you expect from a Tommy Bahama restaurant. We've been there three times in the last year and it always seems to be the same chain restaurant experience. Again, food is great, service friendly, just lacks ambiance. The fact they won't let you smoke a cigar on the outdoor patio also irritates..."}
{"text":"Elegant spot, with a breezy, safari vibe.  This is a place where E.F. Hutton, or the Dos Equis \"most interesting man\"in the world regularly holes away.  The fish and/or steak are the way to go here.  I would definitely try the \"world famous\" coconut shrimp.  Service is unimpeachable.  Take a break from the world, and transport yourself to a desert island. Don't miss the gift shop! Like being on a cruise ship."}
{"text":"LOVE the plantains...  yes, plantains...  I order the fish tacos all the time when I go for lunch just to get them...  Must have

."}
{"text":"My family and I came in here for lunch and it wasn't busy at all. The service here is impeccable. Our glasses were never empty and we didn't have to ask for anything. Love when that happens.

Between us we ordered two cheeseburgers, fish and chips, crab cakes and a chicken and mango salad. Everyone loved their entrees. There were so many blueberries on the mango salad...they don't skimp on the ingredients. Everything was cooked and prepared perfectly.

It's a beautiful restaurant with a nice tropical theme. You can pretend you're in the islands while on vacation in Vegas! And afterwards you can go shopping in the store."}
{"text":"Very tasty and unique food/drink menu...For my fellow Paleo people, they have mashed potatoes for us!!! (cauliflower) , but they taste just as good if not better!"}

We started with the Barbados Holiday cocktail which was rum raspberry muddle & Ginger Honey-Outstanding! We had the Ahi bowl and the Miso Salmon bowl from their specials menu. Booth were great but the Ahi won out.  Pina Colada cake & Kona coffee to finish everything off!"}

{"text":"HAPPY HOUR (4-7pm) REVIEW:

Man..their main courses are of wwwaaayyy better quality than their happy hour. Now, I'm a big fan of Brio's happy hour so when participating on a happy hour I expect the same quality. 

I ordered the blackened fish tacos for $6.00 and a slice of my faovrite Pina Colada cake for $6.00. Not only was the fish dry, but the size of the fish in the taco was about the size of my pinky finger. The seasoning was of a likeable taste, but it was drowning under a big mound of coleslaw. Definitely not a happy hour item I would recommend.

The macadamia nut goat cheese for $5.00 was pretty good. It is a small portion (like a small scoop portion) garnished with a sweet mango salsa. It was had a nice sweet flavor with a good macadamia crunch! 

I also tried the lobster bisque which was good too. A good cream density with a great sweet bisque flavor. It had very subtle pieces of lobster in their, but it was still a good eat! 

The desserts as usual are on point! As always I chose the Pina Colada cake which is my favorite cake of all time. It never fails. However, I did come across a new infatuation with the pineapple creme bruelee. So sue me for being super overly excited that it's serve in a pineapple dish! Don't start worrying that maybe with the nice presentation that they may hold out on the pineapple chunks. The creme brulee has two layers of pineapple in it, and then the actual brulee on top of it. Oh it was such a good combination. Who knew that pineapple and creme brulee would taste so good!

If the happy hour doesn't improve in quality, I do hope they bring back their 3 course menu special. (Hint. Hint. Tommy!)"}
{"text":"I had a flat iron stake with a sangria sauce (especially of the day) + a mojito. The mojito was not bad but a bit too sweet and the stake was good but the broccoli had too much butter. In general it seems to have food, I'd return to the restaurant but was not perfect for the price..."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot.  The bartender Brian was incredible and attentive.  He was on top of my drinks before I ever had to say anything.  Great suggestions on the happy hour food!  I am in the service industry and really appreciate an amazing experience all around.  If I am going to spend my money then it better be worth it and oh my god this place is great!  The atmosphere here and the live solo entertainer singing the music right out of my I pod just blew my mind.  This is great food, great drink, and great entertainment rolled into one.  Do it!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here regularly for the past 3 years, and it just never gets old. Fish tacos to die for!!! Tuna poke is a must, my husband is addicted to the steak salad. Love the live music, perfect people watching outdoor lanai, amazing wine list! Worth every penny! The service is impeccable, we truly miss it if we miss a week or two."}
{"text":"I read reviews and decided to take my friends who came in town to eat here. I had a chicken dish and they had seafood. This was the blandest food I had eaten in a while. Parking may require a meter or a walk depending on the time you go.  The extra star is only for the delicious pina coloda cake we split after being disappointed with dinner.  It was so big we even had leftovers to take with us.  I would only go back for dessert."}
{"text":"Food was not what I expected .  It was outstanding.  The flavors blended perfectly together. When I took a bite out of the  lollipop chicken it literally fell off the bone.  So tender and good.  The French Dip was mouth watering.  Great service from the host to our server to the manager.  It was our first time and we will so be back.  Our server gave us great suggestions."}
{"text":"love this place! excellent staff. very informative as far as the whole menu goes. absolutely amazing drink menu! great inventive appetizers! and two out of the 3 times i've been there, they had a wonderful guitar / singer playing during happy hour in the bar!"}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama clothes make you feel like you're on vacation all year round.  

Located in the super cute Town Square, we were able to drive right through the shopping center and park close at a metered spot.  I think this is the first time I've seen metered parking in Las Vegas.

We bought a t-shirt for Honey from the Tommy Bahama \"Relax\" collection.  I really wanted a cute blue hat but I didn't buy it.  Probably should have since I can't get it out of my head now!

They had a lot of beachy, but sophisticated, dresses.  And the barware was really cute and had a Carribean feel.  The candles smelled delicious.  

We were offered plenty of assistance but they also knew to give us room to laugh and shop.  And the atmosphere was tropical all the way!"}
{"text":"It's was good quite Sunday meal. It was not busy when we arrived at 8pm and was seated promptly. The Tuna with guacamole was great. One of the best lemon martinis ever. Carrie was our server and she was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Overall pleasant experience, had a good meal with outside dining.

Tried the Mai Tai, which was pretty good, having never tried one before. Came in during happy hour so it was priced well, yay!

Had the Salmon BLTA, as it seemed like a good day to have a sandwich; the sun going down, air a bit breezy. It was a good thing I chose outside seating. ANYWAYS, the salmon sandwich was pretty good, so it surprised me when I was told I was lucky, as it was being taken off the menu.

At the end of my meal, I was offered a postcard, which I can send anywhere in the world, and Tommy Bahamas pays for the postage! I sent it to my gorgeous girlfriend (great place to come drinking often fellas; always remind your S.O. you are thinking of them!)"}
{"text":"It wasn't entirely horrible but the taste and price were so far off. 

Ahi poke... More like guacamole with a little bit of ahi poke and by ahi poke they mean salty oiled down slices of tuna. 

Chip and dip platter... Guacamole is loaded with garlic powder but the pimento cheese is not bad!

Deep fried tomato... Average but interesting. 

Stuffed shrimp with scallop... Not good, yikes. 

Crab and avocado salad... Was that canned crab? Dry, loaded with feta cheese to look like there's more canned crab then actual.

Ribeye... Aiyayaya.

Pappardelle pasta... 

Vegetarian Cobb salad... Arrived with bacon. 

Party of four... $163... I'll stick to my usual restaurants and the next time I get curious and my friends ask me if the place is a clothing store I'll stick with that and keep walking. 

Three stars for the ambiance and kind staff."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely DELICIOUS. My compliments to the chef(s). I have it 2 stars because unfortunately the service is very poor. Our server took our orders wrong when we stated specifically 3-4 times what we wanted. Didn't bring one of our plates. And we felt rushed. Hardly came to our table. It was not even busy. The young boy (food runner) was very friendly. So was the manager. Won't be coming back to this location. I'd rather drive further to go to a different one."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception (28 people) at Tommy Bahamas in a room near the back. It was amazing! The communication back and forth (via email) was really great, I was able to customize our menu easily and bring in my own wedding cake. Everything was so easy and friendly. The food was amazing, all the guests were really impressed with the food and cocktails they ordered (especially the crab bisque soup!). To top it all off, the service was A++. They went above and beyond for everyone at the dinner. I can't say enough about my experience at Tommy Bahama, it was definitely the best and easiest part of my wedding day in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with a friend for dinner--the food is good, I had the tuna tar tar both times and it was great.

This review is mainly because Katie, the bartender/our server was so outstanding.  It takes a special flair for someone to be a great server and able to make people want to come back and she definitely has it.  Super cute, personable and goes above and beyond at her job.

Another plus-they have quite a few things they can prepare gluten-free, since my friend is intolerant.

But Katie is the highlight:)"}
{"text":"SO MUCH YES! 

Took my niece here for a celebratory lunch after her high school graduation. We'd never eaten there before but had heard rave reviews from friends. Those reviews were right. We enjoyed chicken lollipop appetizers, and assortment of entrees ranging from the burger to some kind of stuffed chicken breast, and the pineapple creme brulee was to die for. Oh, so were the coconut cloud martinis. 

My only complaint is that the closest location to me is two hours away. Sad face. :("}
{"text":"Last night was awesome.  Emily took great care of us and because of the bad service we got previously from 4 other restaurants, the chef gave us an appetizer shrimp coconut for free.  Sangria was great and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the service was great.  I ordered the filet mignon sliders and it came with a simple salad.  Little did I know that the simple salad was basically one large butter lettuce leaf with a tiny tomato cut up on the side.  The dressing was horrible.  The filet mignon sliders were great though.  The prices are a bit much for drinks too.  I'd rather go to Blue Martini or Morton's and pay for expensive drinks."}
{"text":"So apparently this place has been here for a while. I never knew it! I visited the one in the Palm Spring/Palm Desert area in California once while visiting good friends who live there and loved it. So, I had to come here for lunch one day and made the stop.

I loved the beachy, cozy feel of this place. It was pretty busy during a midweek day for lunch, which is a good sign. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich. Loaded with great flavor! I would have eaten the entire thing if I didn't need to lose a few pounds! :) The Jerk Yucca Fries on the side were just Yuck-A, in my opinion. Definitely an acquired taste, so I gladly gave them to a friend I was having lunch with and she enjoyed them. Let's not waste! 

I will be back to this location to try other things on the menu and will insist that we have more than just drinks the next time I am at the Palm Springs/Palm Desert location when I am visiting my friends. Kudos to the establishment!"}
{"text":"Wow I was quite surprised how great the food was here after doing some shopping next door at Tommy Bahama clothing store. The Scallop sliders are to die for... Awesome.. lump crab soup also incredible, chicken lollipops also amazing and the key lime pie was best I ever had. And pretty server/bartender who is very nice. Also live music from a one person guitarist/singer who is very talented. A lovely spot!"}
{"text":"*** Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***

This would be a three star review if not for the outstanding service we received.  This was an afterthought when I was looking at the RW offerings.  I decided it was wife friendly (it's difficult to get her to try different things).  

We came here in the late afternoon.  I had checked the times online and the Tommy Bahama website said dinner was from 4 on.   We were there at 4:30 and got the lunch RW menu and were told that dinner service begins at 5 PM.  That's where our server, Naomi, showed us what the service would be like.  She went to the kitchen and then came back.  After collecting our lunch menus, she went to the stand and brought back the dinner menus.

I started with the coconut shrimp with an Asian slaw.  The shrimp were resting on a mango-papaya chutney.  My wife had the classic Caesar--romaine leaves with Grana Padano cheese and garlic croutons.  Both were good starters.  My shrimp  had little coconut flavor.

During our starters, Naomi brought some hot bread from the kitchen.  They serve the bread with a cinnamon butter which is quite good.  I thought it was odd that they had no bread plates.  I happened to have my starter plater so I could use that.

For the main courses, I got the pork loin and my wife got the parmesan crusted Sanibel chicken breast--a selection not shown on their online RW menu but a good choice.  Naomi asked how I liked the pork--medium and I said rare to medium-rare.  I didn't want the meat too dead.  It was cooked too much and it wasn't a bit juicy.  It was a huge loin--almost like they took a loin and cut it in half.  It was served with asparagus and 6 silver dollar size sweet potato pancakes.  The sides were very good!  My wife's chicken was good.  Her chicken came on a bed of garlic mashed and some broccolini.  

For dessert, I got the piña colada cake and my wife got the four layer triple chocolate cake.  Excellent and once again, a large portion.

Iced tea was refilled promptly without asking.  Naomi was always around without being intrusive and she had a sparkling personality!  She makes this a 4 star review.

** I apologize for only having two photos.  I forgot to bring my Yelp camera and my phone went dead after just two."}
{"text":"Menu had a lot of fresh and healthy options. Service was great, large restaurant with tons of seating"}
{"text":"4 stars for a great dining experience.

1 star = for the awesome customer service.  Our waiter was super nice and extremely attentive.  She made some great recommendations and was never MIA!

2 stars = for the Crab Bisque.  Yum!  This soup was delish!  It is a definite must try!

3 stars = for the Santiago Sea Bass.  I love fish, and this dish was made beyond my expectations

4 stars = for the environment.  Well lit, and not too fancy to where you have to feel like you have to dress formal.  But fancy enough that the you feel fancy!

I will definitely come here again to bring a friend for lunch or dinner.  It's a great place to come and have good conversation over a great meal."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here since moving to Vegas, but it hasn't worked out. After \"checking in\" I found the timing was wrong given my new wardrobe addition of a foot and leg cast, very awkward foot boot, a walker and terrible parking with a long walk to sit down for dinner. After a couple of circles around the place we decided to give up this time around and try again when the cast is gone and there is less of a crowd. Guess this is the long way of \"checking out.\"  Four stars because that many people with four and five stars can't all be wrong."}

{"text":"\"Wanna get some food from Tommy Bahama's?\"

\"Sure.. wait what??\"

Yea, Tommy Bahama's is not just a clothing store, they serve Hawaiian type food.  My friend ordered stuff to go for us since she had a visitor at her house:

Loki-Loki Tuna Poke: Tuna w/ capers soy and sesame oil served with guacamole and 6 strips of chips.  It was ok.  Good filler but not worth $16.50. 

Little Cayman Lollipops: 6 drumettes grilled, smoked with a mango BBQ sauce glazed. Comes with a dipping sauce, but i had no idea what it was.  Very tasty treats.  My tongue was very please to meet these bad boys, but for $9.50 per an order.. Eek! 

Saba Steak Salad: Marinated, char-grilled tenderloin medallions, grilled potatoes, roman tomatoes, shiitake chips, garlic aioli & tamarind vinaigrette.  Steak was really tender and satisfying.  The vinaigrette was quite addicting too.

My buddy ate two salad, Tahitian Tuna Salad ($17.50 )and I think the St. Croix Salad ($16.50).  It still amazed me how much this tiny girl can eat.  She was pretty quiet the whole time munching on her greens, so i guess that's a good thing. 

Overall I was very astonished that the food came out positive for the most part, but it's just a little controversial since the price was a bit steep.  Service was wonderful though.  We ordered to go from the bartender and she was very easy going and helpful.

{"text":"I would have never thought to go to this restaurant had someone not given us a gift certificate. We were expecting nothing, we were very pleasantly suprised. Ambiance was very island bungelow themed, live guitar from a cute sunken bar. Menu was a nice mix of seafood and some
Bahamanian flare. Why someone would order a chicken ceaser salad here I'll never understand?? Our waiter (who we later learned was on his first night) was great, new the menu well and guided us to great choices.
Very impressive over all experience, Manager spent a few minutes with us very nice as well. I would recommend this place especially for light dinner with clients or lunches. Looking forward to trying it again."}

{"text":"Just recently moved back to Vegas from CA. I have to say that the bad taste left in my mouth from the utter lack of customer service in CA was quickly erased as we were seated at the bar in Tommy Bahama's. The bartender, Katie, greeted us immediately and asked us where we wanted to sit. She brought over water and menus without us even asking for them. My friend was commenting that her phone was dead and Katie brought over her own personal rapid charger and plugged my friends phone in. Then she helped me decide on what to drink, I was torn between wine and their sangria. Katie responded with \"Don't you worry about it, I am going to make you something that you will love!\" She was right on. It was delicious. She then proceeded to tell us about their mind blowing Happy Hour and all the different appetizers they offered. After we paid the bill, the General Manager came over, introduced himself and asked if everything was ok. Superior Customer Service is an understatement. They really nailed it. We will be back. Thank you Katie!"}
{"text":"I brought our daughter, her husband and two children to Tommy's for lunch.  The children's ages are 3 and 1.  Let me just say, the waiter got an extra tip.  We left a mess.  The food was as good as the other locations we have frequented.  The staff was polite and efficient.  The place was 10% filled so it was very quiet, with the exception of the 2 grandchildren."}

I'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.

Strolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. \"Bow ties are cool\" so who am I to judge.

Now for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos
And a Mai Tai.

All were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.

The service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..

Overall
Drinks: 2-5
Food: 3-5
Service: 4-5
Back again: yeah maybe I'll stop by, but there is a few other places Id go to first in town square"}
{"text":"My family & I go out to eat every  Friday,Saturday, & Sunday. I don't think we have ever had such horrible service. We sat at the table for 10 minutes not one person took our drinks or even greeted us. All the employees just looked at our table nobody ever came. When we finally got up to leave some of the employees said bye thank you. 
Worst service ever."}
{"text":"According to our server, everything is made from scratch. 
To celebrate  my one-and-only's pre-birthday dinner we stopped into Tommy's on a whim. I got the Kobe burger & he had their fish tacos.
Here's what we were in store for...

-Kobe burger: sautéed mushrooms, garlic aioli, grilled onions on a brioche bun and yummy skinny fries on the side.

-Blackened fish tacos (3  to an order): basa fish, chipotle aioli, shredded lettuce, cilantro & pico de gallo. Came with a side of fried plantains in a creamy coconut sauce.

WOWWEEE!!! So we always share dishes when we go eat and we weren't short of impressed or felt jipped by the fairly expensive dishes we ordered. The tacos were a prefect blend of tanginess & juiciness. The white flakey fish was amazing & aioli and pico de gallo, refreshing.  My burger was perfection but a bit too rich for my tummy so I wasn't able to finish it.  I definitely got it to go though. This restaurant/clothing store beat my expectations and I'm always happy about that. If you are at Town Center doing some shopping stop by and get some grub here. You won't regret it. They also have a happy hour...I think from either 3 or 4pm to 7pm."}
{"text":"amazing best dinner in years, Simply Amazing Food and Drinks.  Everything complimented each idividual flavor on all the dishes."}
{"text":"The perfect dining experience for my last night in Vegas this week.  One of my friends is a local and she brought a few of us to the \"downtown\" area - off the strip and away from the chaos that is Vegas on a Friday evening.  We had a great time and the food was stellar.  Couldn't have been a better place for us to relax, have great food, and chit-chat after a week in Vegas. 

If all the Tommy Bahama's are this good, the chain is going to be on the top of my must-attend places when dining out..."}
{"text":"I had the blackened Ahi Tuna salad and it was so amazing! 2nd time coming here and I will be back for more! Such amazing food and service is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"Nice. My husband and I spend the Christmas Eve here. Foods good. Environment nice. Price reasonable. Next time will come back. We had nice time here."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here seeing they actually had a happy hour on Sunday and it exceeded every single expectation! Katie our bartender was very sociable, knowledgeable, and especially sweet. Had the ahi poke (I wanted another one) fish tacos, burger sliders, goat cheese spread and my absolute favorite was the crab bisque. Quick chat with Kevin, the manager and the grapefruit basil cocktail made it the perfect Sunday dinner date with the other half."}
{"text":"Nothing but amazing things to say about this restaurant! 

My husband and I were here scouting options for large party dining options for our clients. Kaaren is honestly the most amazing host and representative of this restaurant! She walked us through the property and showed us the private dining space. If you are in need of  private or semi-private dining for ANYTHING this is the place to go! The decor is beautiful and the food was well above our expectations.  

The bartender makes amazing drinks - there are no weak drinks here! We started off with the coconut shrimp and then for our main course I had the Linguine with clams and my husband had the Fish Tacos (make sure SOMEONE in your party gets these).

This is by far our new favorite restaurant and I cannot wait to start sending our clients here!  Thank you to Kaaren and the entire staff for their hospitality! We will see you soon!

{"text":"This is a review for their bar area ONLY.  

I've been to Tommy's for dinner before which I thought was good, but pricey. Anyhow, back to the bar. My fiancé was really excited to take me to Tommy's for HH, because he had went with his friends and he raved about their excellent martinis. I LOVE martinis, so I was excited too. We decided to stop by for HH, the bar was packed. We decided to come back after walking around. We were just in luck, there were 2 seats open at the bar. The bar was clearing out as HH had just ended, but we didn't mind, because I JUST had to try this martini. We sat there for about 10 minutes and finally a bartender came up to us and we asked for their drink menu. As I had stated before the bar was emptying out and by that time the bar was only half full. There were seats next to us that were now empty. One guy came and sat in the seat next to us. The bartender gave him a drink menu right away. Another 10 minutes passed and no one has come by and asked if we liked to order anything. (It didn't seem like they were too busy as the bartenders were chatting with people and to each other). The guy next to us had already gotten his drink like 5 minutes ago. We left shortly after that. There was no reason why were ignored at the bar for 20  something minutes, we were sitting right in front and it was just ridiculous how we were being ignored. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in their lack of service and I won't be coming here anytime soon. I definitely don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxing tropical ambiance and friendly service. I enjoy this place every time I dine here. The shrimp yuzu tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time here. Delicious food. Tasty drinks. Happy hour was worth it. Prompt seating/service. Not to mention great location to walk off all the food! Would definitely return. 

The only setback was my wife's drink was forgotten when everyone else received their drinks. But it was understandable since service was busy."}
{"text":"This is a huge store (has to be the biggest in town, in fact), and it's not divided (males/females- like at the Forum Shops). Also, there is a Cafe as well. The last time we came here, the salesman (middle-aged) was helpful, but not pushy. Tommy Bahama doesn't associate itself as being a Hawaiian Shirt brand (there are some TB stores on the islands), but rather, a Fine Resort Wear brand. Oh, and those cilantro-pineapple candles are so yummy smelling.   

Ok, there was a joke about young guys wearing TB shirts on \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" My husband is a fan of the silk hawaiian camp shirts, which typically run around $125. I'm a fan of the dresses (runs about $78- $135, the average dress is $125), but I've also got shorts, and a sweater too by TB. We both love the copyrighted prints, the quality, and the designs. This is such a popular brand, that there are knock-offs of the mens shirts, so you have to be careful, if you're not shopping at the TB stores."}
{"text":"A cool place to check out.. Very trendy. The drinks and food are above average. I had the snapper and a signature drinks. Def a must go... AND OMG.. I don't even like deserts.. The Pina Colada Cake will give you an orgasm."}
{"text":"I can honestly say - and this is a big one to admit, this is my favorite restaurant in town. As a vegetarian it's easy to enjoy places as it is to get disappointed with their dull salads or non sophisticated dishes. 
Tommy Bahamas, though, have one of my favorrrrrrite things - their vegetarian tacos. This is what I call the perfect dish, tasty, large, so damn flavorful and simply yummy. That coconut yogurt is Devine! It comes with plantain are both are just heaven! Love it."}
{"text":"Came here for steak and its really great, very juicy and tender. The mac and cheese is super cheesy, my daughter absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"My first visit. I can't give 5 stars only because of the price. Normal menu items are pricey, but if you stop by for happy hour you can get a good amount of food and drinks for a good deal. I am local and going out for drinks regularly can add up. I prefer to go to places with a good atmosphere and deals.The coconut shrimp and pork quesadillas were my favorite. The shrimp is delicious, but you only get 3 shrimp for $8! I have been obsessed with Whiskey Smash's lately so I decided to ask if it was possible to make. Julian made me a Whiskey smash with blueberries and it was really tasty! Next time I will try the other happy hour drinks for $6 to $7."}
{"text":"If want a great atmosphere with Great patio seating... service was on point and the food was  good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We'd ordered salad and sandwich for 2 and told them we ganna share the meal, so we need small plates.
Then, they divided meal into 2 equal portion !!
Taste was good."}
{"text":"I decided to swing by Tommy Bahamas for restaurant week because the menu they had looked promising. We picked the 30 dollar option and from it we both got the crab bisque and coconut shrimp,  then differed on the entree where I got the ribs and he got the fish and chips. For dessert I added on the key lime pie. 

I was surprised how fast service was,  after each course they soon brought over the next,  and our waitress was super attentive.   I was happy to see they carried beer from kona  brewing company.   I appreciate the unique floral notes it tends to posses,  but I I was unsure which one I wanted.  She brought me samples of the two I was contemplating so I could easily decide. 

So down to the food.   The crab bisque was creamy, flavorful,  and had nice pieces of crab inside.  It went great with the heavenly bread they supply the table.  So hot and buttery mmmm  I'm having a moment just thinking about it. 

The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and coated, golden and juicy on a mango dipping sauce,  with a savory jicima slaw. The best coconut shrimp I have ever had.  

The ribs were where they lost me a bit.   They had this blackberry sauce which was OK,  but the ribs had to many dry hard areas.  It had the same great jicima slaw, which seems to be a common side with many items,  and the cauliflower mash was great.  However, since the star of the dish was the ribs it failed to continue the joyful momentum I had started to feel from the former dishes. 

My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the spin on the dish was the chips were made of yucca instead of potatoes.  The fish was battered well, not the best fish and chips I have ever had, but solid still.  It also had the jicima slaw, which they call island slaw actually. 

After all this food I was exploding so I asked them to switch my pie, which for restaurant week was only a 5 dollar addition, to a to go order. It ended up being delicious.  Great tart to sweet ratio,  solid crust, and lovely whipped topping. 

This was the first time besides happy hour I had dined at this establishment,  and over all I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner again...especially for those shrimp."}
{"text":"We came here to cool off from the heat and were we happy to have had a great lunch and treat. Doug was our waiter and couldn't have been more pleasant. He gave us excellent service by far the best service we have had in awhile. We enjoy cool beer and they split our appetizer for us which was very thoughtful. Our sandwiches came out in a timely manner and when they did we didn't even pause to chat because we were too busy enjoying every bite. 
Doug came out with a whole tray of their desserts they have available and believe me there was no way you could say no! Everything on that tray looked fresh and delicious! They definitely know what they are doing! We chose the coconut cake! By far the one of the best places to enjoy yourself. Shout out to the chef Agustine!!! Our food was great and definitely going back there!"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd. just south of the Famous Las Vegas Strip. What a fantastic happy hour! Fun items on the menu such as Jerk Chicken Lollipops! The coconut pineapple cake is not to be missed, and I usually wont eat dessert unless chocolate is involved, so there os that. Take a seat on the patio for some fun people watching. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Normally I hate to admit that I like a chain restaurant, but the food here is really good so I must break tradition.

The drinks are good and they have some fun, fruity drinks like the Key Lime martini. The crab cake appetizer is amazing. They fill it with blue crab and then dress it with a delicious Thai chili sauce. I also love the plantains that come with an amazing yogurt dip. My husband really enjoys the fish tacos.

They are located right in the middle of Town Square so it's convenient if you are already shopping in the area."}
{"text":"Two words - \"Kobe Burger!\" - This is a triple-threat full-flavored burger. This burger delivers on 3 levels, meat, topping and bun. Snake river farm medium-cooked meat. Crispy Shitake mushroom and onions. And toasted buttery Brioche Bun. My gosh, my mouth is watering with this review. 

The fries are top notch also. My big mistake was eating too much bread at the beginning of the meal. By coincidence, we stumbled upon a side of fried plantains that was divine. Similarly to the Brazilian steak houses, the plantains is cleansing to the palate but also delicious as a desert. 

Great Island ambiance and service, Tommy's my new favorite place to grab a burger before a movie."}
{"text":"Was in town square a few days ago and decided to check out their happy hour before catching a movie...what a great decision! Their happy menu includes a good selection of food and drink specials. We had the fish tacos which were grilled to perfection and the jerk chicken lollipops which had tons of flavor and meat that fell right off the bone. I also ordered the sliders which were moist and delicious as well. My only complaint was that it took almost 30 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered...but we did get our drinks pretty quickly. In addition to the food they also had a gentleman with a guitar singing in the corner of the bar area. Live music, excellent ambiance, friendly service, reasonable prices. I will definitely be back to try out their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Place smells amazing.  Stopped in lot lunch in a Sunday. Not much going on very relaxed. Defiantly an older demographic. Got the roasted goat cheese bake. Server brought extra crackers for it without asking. Had the special of the day jerk meatloaf sandwich. Very good."}
{"text":"From start to finish this is just a great place to dine and drink. I recommend sitting at the bar because they have a great happy hour and the bartenders are always extremely pleasant. Kevin is a hoot! 

They have a great variety of happy hour drinks, from sangria and glasses of wine, to martinis. The happy hour food is a good as well. The duo of dips is a good snack, the beer cheese is delicious! 

As for entrees I haven't tried many but I did try the ahi tacos and they were pho nominal!!!"}
{"text":"I am glad the Tommy Bahama brand diversified themselves with having restaurants or maybe the clothing line came after?  Regardless....the clothing line is by all means for individuals well into the 40s+.  Although it's the not the clothing line I am reviewing, but felt it was necessary to share.  

From Scottsdale to Maui and now my experience in Las Vegas, I have to say it is a chain that has yet to disappoint.  The service has always been top notch,  the food is fantastic and the prices are on the edge of being overpriced, but the price point works for me.  

Portion sizes are usually enough to share so getting a couple apps, an entree which allows drinking during and dessert at the end has been the way I usually do it.  Do not think they are oversized because they are not.  Each entree is sized to be filling....I'm just saying that the appetizers are too good to not order more than one.  Which ones do I recommend?  All of them....seriously.  

We were on the patio at night and wasn't crazy about the in ground spot lights that was kind of blinding at times....nice for ambiance, but wasn't a fan at my table.  The bar looked like a good place to come if you are looking to have a spot to attend regularly.  The right size and the right mix of men and women...."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I must say that place is nothing more than a glorified Chilis that specilaizes in fusion American/Hawaiian food. Mainly it taste like any other average American restaurant that happens to have Ahi tuna in a large number of their dishes. Despite my own inclination not to go with the special for lunch, I decided to go against my gut and get the \"Tuna Melt\" for lunch. I mean who doesn't want beer-battered avocado slices in their sandwich? Before any of you get on me, if you saw the menu, you'd see for yourself for the lack of eye catching items minus the fish tacos. Anyways, the food gets there and it looks like sandwich that came from Denny's. I must have not payed attention because the sandwich also came with two slices of thick bacon. Never have been a real fan of bacon and I have noticed in my foodie experience that places generally add bacon to dishes that lack any real flavor. Surprise, surprise: the sandwich tasted like nothing. The tuna was very fishy and was obviously not the freshest cut of fish available. It tasted like a very fishy chicken salad sandwich and also looked like one. If you are a huge fan of the aforementioned, you'd be in love. However, if the thought of a chicken salad sandwich ellicits a emesis response from your dopamine receptors like mine, then you will hate it. Fries...how can you mess this up. Shockingly, my fries were stale and cold and had something that resembled and tasted like Italian seasoning on it. Service, I wish I could say was on point, but our server looked pretty busy. No real rapport established besides for taking the order and refilling our waters. No recommendations. No small talk. Like dining at a  tropical themed McDonalds. The only great part of this experience was their Creme Brûlée which housed in a pineapple. I could have eaten four of those. In summary, I would not recommend this place besides for the desserts and will not willingly go back here again. I've heard their happy hour is great so maybe I'll try that out in the future. *Mic drop."}
{"text":"While heading to Tommy Bahama I was perplexed talking to my friend over the phone who had discovered they were offering a happy hour on a Thursday night. 

\"What? You mean the place that sells the Hawaiian shirts?\"

Well yes, they do, but this one has a restaurant/bar attached to it. And they DO have a very wonderful happy hour menu. I started off with a Chardonnay ($6) and then moved on to their Mai Tai ($6). I wish I had had two Mai Tai's! It was delicious and it packed a punch! I was feeling a little tipsy. The presentation was nice too. 

I had the fish tacos off the happy hour menu. The tastes were delectable and even though they were tiny little tacos there was plenty of grilled fish in them. I love grilled fish tacos and I hate fried fish tacos, bleck. However they were a bit on the cool side. I think they may have been sitting for a few moments too long before being brought out. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying them.

So, those are all the good things. Here are some not-so-good things. First off there was a guy there \"playing\" guitar. I use quotations because half the time he was not actually playing his guitar, but instead messing around with his Mac Book which was playing his music for him? Eh, lame. Next off when I was drinking my wine the bartender swooped up the little decanter she had given me along with the wine glass, well there was still wine in it! My jaw literally dropped and I stared at her in disbelief. She quickly deposited it back in front of me and I snatched it up and poured the rest of the wine in my glass quickly. I don't know if it was an accident, but either way it was incredibly awkward. Lastly, the bartender also dropped off the incorrect check for my friend and I (and then we never saw her again). A new bartender arrived who prodded us into purchasing more drinks, but then left us and never returned to see if we actually wanted more drinks.

Luckily another bartender finally noticed our displeasure because I'm assuming it was radiating from us after being given a check that was #1 not ours and #2 WAY more expensive than our actual check. This bartender was very nice and quick to fix the mix up though.

In conclusion - Tommy Bahama's not just for ugly pineapple shirts anymore!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to find out that Tommy Bahamas actually has a restaurant.  I was even more surprised that their food is really good.  Plus, their service is outstanding.  I had their Cuban sandwich and it was pretty good for it not being made by Cubans or in South Florida.  I think I know how to judge Cuban sandwiches because I used to live in South Florida as well as in the Caribbean.  I also had their crab bisque soup, which was really great too.  Their servings are large; so this would appeal to those with hearty appetites.  I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"We took my husband here for one of his birthday dinners. (We like to celebrate our birthdays all month long!) I love the ambiance because it feels like a mini vacation while you wait for your order. 

I started with the Crab Bisque . It had little bits of blue crab, sherry, cream and crushed croutons. It had a light sweet taste with a pinch of saltiness. It was crabtastic! I think this has a slightly better taste then Texas De Brazil 's Lobster Bisque. 

I ordered the Thai Shrimp and Scallops as my main entree. I was hesitant at first because some places under cook the scallops where they taste a little too chewy . They cooked the scallops perfect! I expect scallop to be flaky and not gooey. The curry taste was mild which I prefer. I liked that the coconut/ curry taste  didn't over power each other. 

We ended the meal with the Pina Colada cake. My husband and my brother wanted something chocolaty but I had way too much chocolate for Valentine's day  so we ordered the cake. Everyone at the table liked it because it was nice and moist and the frosting wasn't heavy or overly sweet. 

The service was also on point and very accommodating!"}
{"text":"The service and environment, location, private party room available are great for parties. The dessert and food are excellent."}
{"text":"Had a company party there. Service was outstanding, my glass was never empty. Great atmosphere!!! And the food is good!"}

{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff, a little oasis of peace in the middle of Town Square craziness"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. 
We came for happy hour, which seemed to be wise, because the regular prices on the menu are a little high. 

I ordered a Mojito which turned out to be pretty strong. No shortage on alcohol in this one. LOL! 
Then I had the Sangria, which was good, but a little sweet. 
Then I ordered the blackened fish tacos and macadamia nut encrusted goat cheese.  Both were yummy and I would order them again. My friend ordered the sliders and they looked very good, so I will try those next time. 

The service was great!  Bartender was friendly and super helpful when asking questions.  
Also they had a guy in the corner with his guitar playing music and he sounded really good.

This place had a great vibe and great happy hour!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing. met up w/ my bestie tonight @ town square. We were both hungry so as We walked past the tommy bahama resturant. We asked to peek @ the menu & the Host at the door was very Clever.  I totally wish i remembered his name...my bestie thinks it was Corey but either way you were awesome! We got a great server...William! awesome! Great bottle of wine & not totally over priced wine list.  It's nice to see a couple bottles under $100 bucks. FOOD was OUTSTANDING!!!....Scallop sliders, goat Cheese/mango Ap, lemongrass Ahi Tuna. everything was out of this world. So many other things looked amazing on the menu we will certainly be back to try then out!!! William brought over the dessert tray & made some recommendations. 2 Chocolate things we ordered...1 with Williams recommendation of Godiva liquor poured over it........AWESOME. Arturo the GM stopped by as we were finishing up our dessert. Thanks it was great to meet you!!!! It was truely one of the best dinners I've had in a long time.  The Company (my bestie!), the service & especially the food!"}
{"text":"This is another amazing place.  They have some great things to eat here as well as drink.

I am not a big wine drinker and the manager was willing to help me find a wine I like by letting me try a few different wines until I found one I liked.

So food, the lollipop chicken, the grilled artichoke, the burgers, the RIbeye, the fish, all amazing here. 

The staff, some of the friendliest I have seen in some time.  Every time we have been here lately, from the hostesses, to the servers all have been awesome which in my opinion starts with the leadership and managers.   They project the attitude of the staff and you will not find a friendlier staff who are always happy and wanting to meet the needs of the customer.

I highly recommend this place, they do have a happy hour which is awesome.  On some nights they even have live music in the bar area  which you can pretty much hear even outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Good food, enjoyed this employer event. However the waitress embarrassed me, but I'm over it."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that I hate Tommy Bahama clothes. They are over priced and ugly. 

So now you can imagine my shock when their food is amazing and fairly priced. Everything I've had there is super good. That said, I love almost any place with plantains - but I truly feel the food and drinks are amazing. It's a good go to spot walking distance from the place I stay in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's the beginning of restaurant week in Las Vegas and one of the best places to go for lunch or dinner is right  here. The lunch menu is such a great value and for a good cause. Of course the place was packed when we arrived at one. Service was spotty at times but our waiter, Bronson, was very good and apologetic when things got a little crazy.
Make a reservation......Check out the menu this week......
As a local who has lived here for over 20 years, try them during this very
crazy week in our city. It's awesome. Ciao"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times now and the food, drinks and service have always been consistently satisfying. Whether for Happy Hour or regular dinning hours...the food and service can't be beat!! I like coming here, especially for Happy Hour. The drinks are well made and the acoustic guitarist/singer performing at the bar entertaining the crowd is good!! I am a huge fan of their grilled blackened fish tacos. Very moist, tasty, and the fried plantains with the tropical fruit dipping pudding sauce topped with toasted coconut that come on the side, are simply amazing and compliment the dish beautifully!! Other recommendations are the grilled lime infused Mahi Mahi fish, served on a bed of almond rice and grilled asparagus. Or the savory jerk lollipop chicken wings, the succulent pulled pork quesadilla, and the juicy beef sliders! The desserts are amazing as well...especially the sweet n tangy piña colada cake!!"}
{"text":"I was going thru all the reviews looking for a gluten or vegetarian meal. I just found out about my allergies and wanted my first meal out. Arrived on a Sunday evening, no reservation and were seated at a booth pretty quickly. 

Requested regular water w/o lemon and it tasted a little funny.Not sure what that was about. Asked for the gluten menu and I was impressed with the selection of meals and even desserts for those of us with special dietary concerns. My date and I both ordered from the gluten free menu.
We both remarked around the same time that the service was slow. I had the scallops. It is an APPETIZER size so don't expect a lot. They were seasoned well but a bit overcooked.He seemed to really enjoy the ribs. 

The meal was \"okay\" . I would definitely recommend for those with food allergies, because we get a few decent choices, but I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"I came here for a first date and always thought this place was a clothing store. Well, I learned that Tommy was very versatile in business. This place isn't all that bad. It's a bit on the pricey side, but I you're willing to treat yourself, give this place a shot. The food is pretty tasty. I had scallops with shrimp for the first time and they did not disappoint. It was unexpectedly flavorful, and I'm kind meticulous and highly selective when it comes to seafood. I'll definitely be coming back to enjoy the splendor of their tasty menu again."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the food here at all. All the other restaurants were busy since it was a Friday night. This restaurant didn't have a wait and I wanted to try this place out since I've never ate here before. I ordered the Thai shrimp & scallops and I was very disappointed. It sounded good on the menu, but didn't taste as good as I thought it would. The scallops were undercooked and there wasn't enough curry sauce. The portion was small too and the price for this dish was $27. Definitely not worth that price. The drink I had was the pineapple paradisio which tasted way better than the food! They gave me a complimentary dessert which was the pineapple creme brûlée that was actually in a real pineapple for my birthday which was delicious since I love creme brûlée, but I'm not going to this restaurant for food again."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week meal #3 occurred at Mr Bahama's joint. I wanted to do a work lunch and Town Square is close to the office. Plus, I've always been curious to try their key lime pie. My coworker hails it as the best he's ever had.

With the weather being beautiful out, we sat at a perfectly shaded outdoor patio table and wasted no time in ordering our RW items. My selections were:

* World Famous Coconut Shrimp, Papaya-Mango Chutney, Asian Slaw
* Grilled Chicken & Mango Salad, Toasted Almonds & Macadamia Nuts, Dried Cranberries, Feta, Pepitas, Vine-Ripe Tomatoes, Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette
* Key Lime Pie, Graham Cracker Crust, White Chocolate Mousse

Not knowing much about the brand, I wasn't sure what kind of restaurant Tommy Bahama is supposed to be. Clearly, the store and restaurant have that tropical kind of feel. Everything I sampled today embodied that atmosphere. The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and the slaw and the salad tasted fresh and refreshing. I could totally imagine myself eating those items on a tropical island beach. The chicken could have been more tender and succulent, but the salad more than made up for that shortcoming. As for the key lime pie, it was indeed excellent. The texture was impeccably creamy and it wasn't overly sweet.

Add in the extremely fast and friendly service and I see no reason why I shouldn't give them five stars."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was incredible -service, dinner, drinks- and it's really a shame I didn't write a review then to compare the experiences. Oh well.

This time around, things tanked. A friend and I came for \"Island Time,\" their spin on happy hour. Let me tell you, the service was waaaaay behind island time and that's saying something coming from a local Hawaii girl.

We were waited on almost immediately which was great, especially considering it was NOT busy. But after all our food and drinks came, NO ONE checked on us or cleared our empty dishes or refilled water. The guy who initially waited on us disappeared. I literally had to search for someone to get a refill of water. And even after that it took another 15-20 minutes for someone to check on us. Before the service took a dive, I was interested in ordering more drinks and getting dessert. But when you pay no attention to your customer, to the point you could walk out and the staff wouldn't even notice....something is wrong.

Such a shame because the food here isn't too shabby. Service needs quite a bit of work before I would consider coming here again. Island Time prices aren't enough to lure us back in."}

Total bill cost about $80.00 for two, food was marginal. My daughter had a lobster bisque, as we were walking to our car my daughter barfed all over the parking garage. I went back to the restaurant and told the manager to not serve it anymore that evening.
He didn't seem concerned! He took my number down and told me he would call and check to see if she is okay. Well it's been about 1 month and I still have not heard from him. This place is over rated & I will not be going back and I hope you don't either!

What's is your email address?"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for work and my coworkers and I stumbled upon Tommy Bahama located in Town Plaza during lunch break. 

I only ordered one item:

House Roasted Pork Sandwich ($13.50)- Blackberry Brandy BBQ , Crispy Onions, Asian Slaw, Fries. This item on the menu is huge! Huge portion for a small girl but it was really good. The roasted shredded pork was flavorful. 

Customer service:
I have been eating around Town Plaza during lunch this week and so far Tommy Bahama provides the best customer service. Shout out to Brandon. He was great! Very knowledgeable and went above and beyond with providing us great service.

Overall, I will definitely come to this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome service, nice and clean place and the food was amazing. Thank you for a great experience tommy :)"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years of visits to Tommy Bahamas' restaurant that has solidified my admiration. I love its location (Town Square is just so convenient), the ambience, the sophisticated, yet casual decor, and most importantly, the food (and the drinks). I love planning lunches here with girlfriends, intimate dinners with my fiancé, or happy hour after a day of shopping. It's always wonderful.

I haven't had a meal that I've disliked, but of course there are stand-out dishes. I really enjoyed the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus), Rustic Chicken Pasta (Whole Wheat Spaghettini, Grape Tomatoes, Spinach, Cippolinis, White Wine Broth), and Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad (Lemongrass Crust, Edamame, Corn, Hearts of Palm, Mushrooms, Pine Nuts, Tahini Miso Dressing). I have enjoyed the other dishes as well, but these I would order again and again. 

During happy hour, I really like the Blackened Fish Tacos (Tomato Relish, Chipotle Aïoli, Lime Sour Cream, Asian Slaw) and Jerk Chicken Lollipops (Macadamia Nuts, Jerk Remoulade). The World Famous Coconut Shrimp (served with Papaya-Mango Chutney and Asian Slaw) make a tasty appetizer and their desserts are crazy good! My favorites are the Piña Colada Cake (Vanilla Cake, Myers Dark Rum, Diced Pineapple, White Chocolate Mousse,Toasted Coconut) and the Pineapple Creme Brûlée (Tahitian Vanilla Bean, White Chocolate Mousse). Seriously make room for these desserts and you won't regret it!

I love the island-themed cocktails - they're potent while tasty. The Pineapple Plantation (Van Gogh Pineapple, Honey, Muddled Pineapple, Lemon) and their Classic Mojito (Cruzan Citrus, Cane Syrup, Mint, Hand-Pressed Lime, Soda) are great! They're also usually $11-12, but just $6-7 during Happy Hour!!

Overall, they have great seafood and wonderful flavors. The service has been great every time I've dined as well. Keep in the mind that Happy Hour (4-7pm daily with a good selection) is only offered at the bar, but there are tables surrounding it as well! They also take Open Table reservations for dining in."}
{"text":"Great apps, great service, great decor, really mediocre entrées. Apps are always rock solid. Island time HH is great too."}
{"text":"Always love coming here . The food is amazing and the happy hour menu is terrific . Live music is a bonus ."}
{"text":"Been here several times! 
Glad they could kindly accommodate my allergies and modify their recipes.

I'm a big fan of their goat cheese app, red Snapper, monitors and I keep going back for the Piña Colada cake, I think it's the best thing they offer. 
Others offer it in their menu like the nearby Bahama Breeze, but it doesn't compare. 
I was in there this evening, and a young named Brandon served my family. 
He actually suggested things out of my comfort zone, and his suggestions - I was most grateful for.

I think I'll be back in next week!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for happy hour.   I come here about once a month.  Awesome outdoor patio area to relax and enjoy drinks and food.  Sometimes they have live music in the bar area.  The food is always good and very consistent. My staple food items are the jerk chicken lollipops and the fish tacos. Dined here yesterday with a group of friends and they had a mojito Monday menu. Mojitos for $6 - awesome deal. I love the pineapple jalapeño one!"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience here. Greeted at the door with a smile.  Servers are well educated. I'm kinda picky and when I have questions about ingredients, they always have the answer and never have to run to the kitchen to ask the cooks or managers. Servers are attentive and always make sure our drinks are filled. The bread with the honey butter is amazing! Have also had the parmesan chicken and the snapper. Clean plate! The desserts are all delicious, as well. Never had a bad item on the menu. Anyone on here who complains about the service is likely an overdemanding, entitled customer. Be a bad customer, get bad service, plain and simple. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Second visit for happy hour and I was not a fan of the pulled pork quesadilla. The waiter in the bar area was on top of our refills and was nice, but I feel like their happy hour menu is not as tasty as I would like. :( Maybe the sliders will win me over if I come back."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp. We were a little confused when we walked into a clothing store looking for restaurant. The restaurant is in the back. It is a really nice atmosphere with really fabulous wait staff. We enjoyed all he appetizers and the recommendations for our lunch entrées were spot on. They help you make the best choice by asking good questions and even brought us a free appetizer to sample. It is a lovely place and I wish we had one in my hometown because when I return to Las Vegas I will be looking forward to going back to this one."}
{"text":"Went in a few days ago and had the BEST server,  Shannon! She was so sweet and attentive! She also suggested the really yummy goat cheese app and my fiance also loved the blackened fish tacos she recommended."}
{"text":"Awful food. I ordered mushroom potato salad. Few little pieces of dry oily mushrooms, one potato and huge plate of lettuce. It wasn't written on description. One of the worst experiences ever. Won't recommend it."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama's Restaurant & Bar is located at Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd. South.  Metered street parking was available near the entrance of the restaurant.  The bartender/hostess greeted us quickly although she was dealing with approx. 5 other tables.  The blackberry, basil, ginger cocktail was out of this world!  Exceptionally delicious, the kind of drink you will remember & crave.  The scallop sliders were fantastic and fresh, and the slivers of onion rings were the tastiest I've ever sampled.  Quick service, relaxing/calm atmosphere, flavorful food & drinks."}
{"text":"The service itself would have earned this place a 5 star rating. Our server was Jarrett and he was very considerate (respectfully offering us chopsticks) and helped us Vegas first timers feel right at home with his friendly demeanor. Keep it up Jarrett! 
The decor was beautifully done, light enough to easily read menus and dim enough to be mood lighting. Atmosphere was comfortably chatty but not too loud. 
Food wise our expectations were definitely met. The ahi tuna entrée was my favorite dish and my father heavily praised their scallops. The Mahi Mahi fish itself was mediocre but the quinoa it came with was delicious. The complimentary bread and honey ginger butter was ridiculously addictive...

All in all, easiest (and first) 5/5 ever given."}
{"text":"Delicious moist chicken when we added grilled chicken to our salad. Solid food and went there twice during our vacation."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary there almost 2 weeks ago and I've been meaning to write a review because we had such a great experience there!! Started with the best Sangria ever, a marinated artichoke which was one of the best I've ever had! Our entrees were so delicious and to top it off they brought us a complimentary dessert of our choice for our anniversary. Our server was Teyonce and he was fantastic, we enjoyed all of his recommendations. It didn't even stop there. The next day I missed their call but they called to thank us for celebrating our anniversary there and wanted to see how everything was! Can't wait to go back! Very impressed"}
{"text":"Decided to try the Town Square location on Friday night. Surprisingly, we had no trouble getting reservations for 7:00 PM. When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty. This all seemed very strange given the location and the reviews. We were seated on the patio and the weather was beautiful. Service was somewhat slow but eventually arrived. Drinks were OK. We requested 1800 tequila but they didn't have it. We shared a salad and it was excellent. We had to wait on bread as it was being baked and they ran out. It arrived after the meal was almost over.  My wife ordered the fillet and it was OK but cold. The side vegetable offerings are limited. I ordered the almond crusted snapper. After I ordered they came said that they were out of snapper and would substitute Barramundi. This was a strange substitute. The fish was subsequently delivered and was tasteless and cold. Service was glacially slow. Ultimately, we did not eat the entrées and we left. We were offered a coupon for free appetizer but we left it on the table. Now we know why the restaurant was empty on Friday night."}
{"text":"Spectacular, island style decor.
Our entrees were both delicious."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  It's always a fun spot to go to for a laidback yet upscale meal.  It never seems busy in there for dinner, which is a shame because it's a cute restaurant and the food is great!  BF and I came for a dinner date last Friday and sat in a booth in the bar area.  There was a singer performing some laid back well-known songs.  It was quite empty so we had the place to ourselves.  

We ordered ahi tuna tacos, a crab cake and shared a large filet mignon.  I ordered a martini with cantaloupe (can't remember the name).  EVERYTHING was delicious.  They even brought us our steak already split up onto two plates for us with our own sides on each plate, without us even asking.  Now THAT'S what I call customer service.

I can't wait to go back and eat more food off the menu.  They are a bit pricey but the food is worth it.  

Their drinks are also ALWAYS on point.  Yum!  Highly recommended for a date or a small group.  Not really a place to meet and mingle as there was no one there!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the portion size and the price.  The portions are decent, but will likely not fill you unless you get appetizers and a dessert. And though the food is excellent, I found the price to be a bit steep for what you got. That being said, the service is fantastic and the food superb.  I had the fish tacos, which were probably some of the best fish tacos that I have ever had.  The appetizers we had were the short rib sliders and the coconut shrimp.  Both were delicious.  We topped our meal off with butterscotch pudding and pina colada cake. The pudding was really good, but the cake seemed a little bland.  They also had live music playing, which was great.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour that we take advantage of.  Cool little guitar player/singer in the corner providing some chill John Mayer/classic rock covers.

The manager came over and introduced herself and gave us a free app for a future visit.  Super friendly!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been debating on posting something about my experience at Tommy Bahama last Easter.  Although the food and service was as usual good whatever was happening in the kitchen that day didn't allow us to really enjoy our meal someone yelling, screaming to what I think was personel kind a weird to try to enjoy a Easter lunch with family .... haven't been there since then.... will think it twice on going or at least  ask not to be seated so close to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I like this place!  I was looking for something outside my normal Brio's and decided to try Tommy Bahama and I enjoyed this place.

1.  Style - The food is American and Hawaiian Fusion, which is a nice blend of Asian flavors more suited to the American Palate.  

2.  Ambiance - Very nice, relaxing setting, almost like resort style, with nice window views to the outside areas in Town Square. Very urban like.

3.  Service - Excellent! From the reception desk to the server, I found the service to be fun, relaxing, engaging, all at the right tempo / amount!

4.  Food - 

Appetizers - 

Had the Chicken Lollipop and this was pretty tasty with the Macadamia Nut and the Jerk dressing, although I am not a huge fan of the Jerk taste.  It is not as subtle to me in general. I love having the little drumstick lollipop style which is when they push the meat from the bottom to the top over the bone and it looks like a tootsie pop instead of a chicken drumette.  

Also had the Coconut Shrimp and this was very tasty, tender and very nice sizes as well.  

Seems that with all the appetizers, you can order in an entree size as well!

Food- 

Thai Shrimp and Scallops - Very light flavoring of Curry, with shrimp and scallops over a small bed of rice. The scallops were amazing and the shrimp was fine, it was way overshadowed by the amazingly tender and succulent pieces of scallop....

Lemongrass Ahi Tuna - The tuna was very lightly seared and very raw, which made for a really nice delicate taste / flavor.  Served on a bed of rice with Bok Choy Vegetables. The Bok Choy was nearly perfect, just a bit under cooked for my taste.  However, I do prefer slightly under cooked to overcooked, so this was acceptable to me

5.  They also have private dining area and plenty of space to handle most requirements.  Could be great for business meetings, rent the whole restaurant and etc.  I like it.

GK says check it out and I am gonna go back there for the Kobe Burger......"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my Mom .. honestly I went in not expecting to love it .. I'd been here five years ago when visiting on a trip (before locating ) ...

Anyway Mo totally turned this into a memorable experience so if you're heading to Tommy Bahama during lunch time ask for Mo he's awesome :) he didn't make us feel rushed and aligned and related while making awesome food recommendations and being friendly and genuine ...

Their seasonal menu was out and Mo showcased the different items that could be tasty .. My Mom and I could not decide so we shared one 702 Tenderloin burger meal and one Cuban Sandwich..

While waiting they brought out a little complimentary bite of seafood ceviche that was delicious 

The 702  tenderloin burger is like this ciabatta bacon jam burger which was cooked medium well since it's filet the meat was totally juicy and they make the burgers fresh and I was impressed with the bacon jam was yummy not overpowering .. the garlic fries were delicious too 


The Cuban came out and I admit usually I only go with that if my Mom is around cause she's so picky but honestly this was one that tasted fresh and authentic and the little potato fry things it comes with I don't know the name were delicious and the food filled us up so much ...



I plan to come back for dessert but we went home with Togo boxes ... this is not a cheap place but considering the service we received for the quality of food I definitely feel it's worth checking out if you're looking for a comfy place to feel like you're taking a trip with quality food while at town square .."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the first thing I noticed was that the prices were a littler higher than most restaurants, however the service was very friendly and food was incredible. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and was not disappointed! I say defiantly go. The atmosphere is fun and has a laid back island feel."}
{"text":"Spiced Sangria was okay but the glass was 90% ice, not drink.
Entree arrived while we were still munching on our appetizer.
My linguine Bolognese was excellent but ended up taking half of it home. Wife's fish tacos were also excellent."}
{"text":"I was so close to giving Tommy Bahama 5 stars, but I can't do it.  We had a friend invite us to lunch and recommended Tommy Bahama.  Neither my wife nor I had eaten there, so we gave it a shot.  Very glad we did.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were only a couple of tables.  Nearly an hour later the place was 75% full, and this was a Tuesday.  This is typically a good sign.    

To start, I had the crab bisque.  This was textbook bisque to me.  Velvety smooth with the cream, and the sherry flavor came through.  It had crab throughout, even a couple of chunks.  A couple of grinds of black pepper and this was excellent.  I would definitely order this soup again.

I had the chicken sandwich with French fries, rather than the yucca fries it is usually served with.  This sandwich was enormous, I was surprised how large it was.  The chicken was grilled perfectly, they pulled it at just the right time so it retained its maximum juices.  It has lots of fried onions, which are always welcome, as well as jack cheese, garlic mayo, and a jerk sauce.  I could have used more sauce, as it provided a well needed kick.  The soft bun kept it all together.  The sandwich was fantastic, but the fries were not.  They were void of seasoning, and tasted like they have been sitting at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.  Some were nearly cold, and none were hot.  This is the only reason I can't give Tommy Bahama 5 stars.

The wife had the special, a grilled cheese sandwich with everything under the sun and tomato soup with some sort of chiles.  We can't recall, it may have been poblanos.  Whatever it was, it was good.  The grilled cheese had blue cheese, bacon, and some sort of jam.  It was on the requisite crispy bread and was fantastic when dipped in the soup, which had a bit of heat from the chiles.  This was a fantastic version of a classic (and overdone) dish, one I hope they add to the menu.

For dessert, we ordered the side dish of fried plantains.  This comes with a yogurt sauce with bits of pineapple that was fantastic.  It was a great way to end the meal, a dessert that was unique but not that sweet.  Like the rest of the meal, I would order this again.  

Overall, very glad we hit up Tommy Bahama, and will do so again."}
{"text":"They were off their game today. The hostess stayed glued to her station letting customers stack up and waited for her one assistant to do the actual seating. The she gave the assistant dinner menus, during lunch, to hand to the customers. 
After ordering, the expediter kept bringing new courses while our empty plates were still on the table. We got to join in with the plate shuffling even though we didn't feel like playing. 
The food was pretty good, at the proper temperatures, and there was plenty of it.
Although service was a bit amateurish, the service wasn't delayed much and the food was worth going back for."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Portions are pretty good, I would say on the smaller side, but it all tastes great."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere -had the shrimp & grits - really enjoyed.it"}
{"text":"After filling our tummies with HH food specials from Brio, Tommy Bahama's Tropical Cafe was next on our happy hour tour along Town Square.

They offer happy hour daily from 4 pm to 7 pm.

They do offer quite a few drinks and food items such as small plate appetizers for $5 and drinks ranging from $3-$7.  (Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.

I started off with: 

* Coconut Cloud Martini \"Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut.\" - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.  

Next up: 

* Kohala Coladas \"Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float.\"  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.

The Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:

* The BBC \"Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice.\" - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!

It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a \"Tommy Bahama\" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.

Overall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you."}
{"text":"First stop...shopping at their retail location.  Wonderful service and fantastic selection.  They have a great layout and so much to choose from.
Next stop...bar.  After shopping and spending our money we needed a beverage!  Wow!  Great bartender, relaxing atmosphere and amazing drink selection.  If you can't find something on their menu to please you something is wrong.  If you're in the mood for a liquid dessert then try the Key Lime Martini!!  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a couple of times and the food is really great. Everyone I ate with loved their lunches as well. The wait staff is also fantastic. Our lunch meeting went over and they gave us a room to run our next meeting. They even shut off the music and closed the doors. Experiences like this definitely build customer loyalty and we'll be back a bunch."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch or even a late breakfast into lunch. Very comfortable setting and environment. The service was great and quick. I was there on a quick business lunch and it was perfect. 

The food was great and there are many options to choose from. I went with a grilled chicken sandwich. Great portion and great taste. I've been here twice and I plan on coming back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, so I was really unsure on what to expect.  We sat on the patio, which I highly recommend, and the atmosphere was great.  The food was delicious too!  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my friend had the Bungalow salad.  We also ordered the goat cheese as an appetizer.  What I didn't like is that they charged an $6 because we asked for veggies to eat with our goat cheese instead of the flatbread listed on the menu.  However, I didn't complain or ask questions, so they might have reversed that charge if I had asked.  One last thing, prepare to spend quite a bit because this place is not for a light wallet... especially if you plan on having a drink or two."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for their happy hour in their charming patios by the beautiful central park with a view of the gorgeous fountain pond, and really enjoyed it. This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!


YELPY DETAILS you could Skip

On this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table. 

We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance! 
- He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of \"On the Road Again\"! 

At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entrée: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent. 

Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!

We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts!

{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  I highly recommend the Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad because it was generous and very well made.  I didn't order a cocktail but I witnessed some other patrons sipping on drinks and they looked extremely delicious.  I also love sitting outside on a warm day and people watching.  This is a part of Vegas that is not geared towards tourists but I find it to be a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"I only give 1 star for the friendliness of the bartender and our server. 
DO NOT order the crab bisque! Was not a soup but more like a sauce.. Was way too heavy and rich. I had several spoonfuls of it and even my date said he was burping it up after. 
I had it worse. I ended up throwing it all up outside the restaurant around the corner by the perfectly, trimmed and manicured green bushes. 
Thanks Tommy Bahama for ruining my first night in Vegas and instead of drinking away, I had to be drinking Pepto Bismo!"}
{"text":"I LOVE coming to Tommy Bahama for lunch or dinner, especially when the weather is nice and we can sit on their patio! They have an awesome happy hour menu with $6 glasses of wine, $5 well drinks, and discounted fish tacos, coconut shrimp and more of their favorites!

Personally, I always love the coconut shrimp, the tangy slaw that comes with them is the perfect accompaniment for the shrimp and the remoulade they sit on! I also love the blackened fish tacos entree, especially the sweet plantains and pudding that come as a side! 

If I am feeling like eating healthy, I also really enjoy the Grilled Chicken and Mango salad that comes with tomatoes, toasted macadamia nuts, dried blueberries and feta. The chicken is always sooo moist and cooked perfectly, probably one of the best pieces of grilled chicken I can recall having consistently at any restaurant!

Finally, what a fun signature touch to provide a complimentary post card when the bill is presented. You can fill out the post card to mail to anyone and they will take care of the postage and mail it out!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for a lunch and business.  Parking can be a challenge at Town Square but worth the effort.  Varied,  extensive menu.  I had a grilled chicken and mango salad.  I was looking forward to the Meyer lemon vinaigrette and was a little disappointed as it was a little overly sweet.  The chicken was seasoned and cooked well.  Portion size was perfect. Service was good."}
{"text":"Good food with a Caribbean twist. Get the fish tacos, they are served with a plantain/yogurt side dish that you'll be dreaming of after you leave! Atmosphere is great and good selection of food."}
{"text":"Very nice waiters and bar attendants..... awesome place that caters to their customers to make sure the meal and drinks are enjoyable.....  thanks guys"}
{"text":"Home Run.  Every dish we had was fantastic. Blackened Fish Tacos, crab bisque and coconut cream were over the top.   And for service, Kevin Rocked it.  Go there ask to sit in Kevin's section.  We left completely satisfied.  Thank you TB team."}
{"text":"The staff and even the manager was every friendly  . The food was excellent and the desert was out of this world."}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama is located next to the park inside town square. We went for happy hour on a Saturday evening. The friendly hostess greeted us and advised us that happy hour was inside in the bar area or on the patio outside. We opted for the bar inside. We sat at a booth that had pillows, it was very comfortable. I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered the sliders. We enjoyed our happy hour meals the pricing for the meal at that time is 8$ or less. We didn't try drinks we wanted to stay hydrated and drink water. Our server kept filling our glasses with water. Our server was courteous and brought or orders quickly. There was also live music in the corner which we enjoyed. The music volume was just right. Not too loud or too soft and the musician was excellent. I felt very relaxed. We really enjoyed ourselves"}
{"text":"Okay so I haven't been back since my last review in November 2010. We went tonight and sat in the bar waiting for a table but 10 minutes in we decided why not eat at the bar? They had the Angels baseball game on and an acoustic duo that was great. Plus the volume wasn't too loud so we could still carry a convo. My husband had the ribs (and he's from Texas so he knows ribs) and he loved them. Let me tell you, he is a plainJane eater, I didn't think he would find anything on the menu let alone actually like something and he said it was excellent! I had the rib eye. Excellent, cooked perfect and I enjoyed every bite! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the location, great bar area, great drinks and surrounded by great people!  I recommend it for locals and hanging out away from the strip!"}
{"text":"Great place.   Feels like a chain but tastes fresh.   It's not quite a 5 star kind of place,  but not complaints."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour last year... Terrible drinks and crabby bartender. Will likely never go back."}
{"text":"Only sub par on this last visit!  The service was just ok.  The food wasn't as good as it had been at one time.  I ordered the fish tacos and they were very salty.  I was pretty disappointed.  They changed the happy hour menu a little bit.  There is happy hour in the bar everyday, even on weekends...but just not what I remembered."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the gf and I were only able to have dessert here on our Vegas trip, but next time we'll definately come back to try the menu.  We shared a slice of the pina colada cake while sitting just inside the deck area.  If you close your eyes you just might think you were on an island somewhere, especially if you have enough of their mojitos, which was made perfectly.  I'm guessing they're using the Tommy Bahama rum?

FYI, the restaurant is located in the new Town Square mall about 1 mile past Mandalay Bay heading towards the airport."}
{"text":"I went to this place after I discovered that Yard House almost requires a reservation for a seat at the bar on a Saturday night.  Almost every dish on the menu has overtones of something tropically influenced.  The service was excellent and the time to wait for the meal was reasonable.  The food itself was sweet in dishes where it didn't have to be (i.e.: the butter was infused with what seemed like cinnamon and sugar)."}
{"text":"I'm not convinced that this restaurant can stand up with everything else in town square. So we've been wanting to try this place out because we heard good things about it. So the place as far as decor was awesome it felt really high end. Now when i looked at the menu the items they had were very simple and stuff that had their own twist on it. 

Our server recommended that i try their vegas burger and my wife had the filet mignon and we had the Ahi Poke Napoleon*. Now the bill i think was the most outrageous part of this meal because for that a couple drinks and a dessert the meal was like $100. 

Ahi Poke napoleon (3/5 stars)- just your typical raw tuna dressed with sesame oil and on top of avocado came with some chips to eat with

Vegas Burger (3/5 stars)- It had alot of ingredients. Cheese, bacon, egg, and this pineapple glaze on a toasted egg bun. the burger was good but it was the pineapple glaze that totally threw it off.if they were to put some ranch and a little it of that glaze on the patty it might have tasted better

Filet MIgnon (1/5 stars)- being that i just went to Mastros to eat i think my expectations were that it was going to be a good steak but nope..overpriced and not well prepared

Overall i love the service and love the restaurant but if i eat here again i will probably order something else..Tommy Bahamas you owe me one!!!"}
{"text":"That's the worst 140 dollar I ever spent!!!!! The food is alrite, the server is suck!!!! There are only two of us and we try to order rids, the girl didnt told us it come with half size n full size...and yea she gave us the full size @@ n for the dessert, is not good at all, we picked the chocolate tart that she told us that's her fav and it was way tooooo sweet and it cost us like 10 dollar..... Last but not least she is not around at all and when we have to go she is talking to her fd and we have to ask another sever to get her.... I never tips bad but this time....she kinda only worth only 10%.... Never ever go there ever again, especially if u r looking for a fine dinning restaurant!!! Waste of my money!!!!!!!! The only good thing abt this dinner is the drink they are pretty good, I got the one with banana in it, yum!!! But other than that don't go!!"}
{"text":"Great experience all around! Many thanks to the most gracious service and food. It was unforgetable.. Very grateful to the best waiter, Mo! The best waiter I've had in a heck of a long time...My friend and I ordered their Cuban sandwich. It was a treat to say the least. It was flawless and on point..(seeing that I grew up in Miami) served with fried yucca, which was just the way it should be cooked, (crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) and a most refreshing lemony salad. And then we ended the lunch with a most special Key Lime pie. Yumm  I so recommend this restaurant. They make you feel special..We actually received a small bowl of their tomato bisque from the Chef for our first time visit, for us to try. Awesome treatment, I'd say!  It was lucious to say the least...The food is made with care...nice plating..clean place. Everyone/Staff is very attentive. No complaints here guys...Give this a try, you will not regret it..... We are coming back, my friend wants to bring her husband. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, meticulously clean with a stunning decor...pictures shown below:"}
{"text":"Ive been to a TB's before in Hawaii and thought the food was much better. Tonight I had the Ahi Tuna, with a ceviche appetizer. The ceviche was fairly bland. The tuna was cooked perfectly but was a little cool when it arrived at my table. Portions are pretty small also.

I'd try again to see if its a one off, but it wont be my first choice"}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference over the course of a year.  I reviewed Tommmy Bahama's almost a year ago, and I thought it was great.  The steaks were great, and even the sweet potatoes, which I normally don't like, were great.  

We have been going to Tommy Bahama's about twice per month since then, and each time has been good, with the exception of this last time.  

Things started off okay, we got our table, got our appetizers, and all was good.  But then the steak came.  My girlfriend just thinks it was overcooked, but it tasted like much cheaper meat to me.  The filet was bland and stringy.  And the sweet potatoes were actually the same, tasteless and stringy.  Odd, but true.  The whole meal was sort of so-so.  

The service was okay, but there was something not quite right.  The staff seemed on edge.  It was a weird feeling, like they were just not happy to be there.  And then the topper; my girlfriend put some sweet potato on a smaller plate to try them out, and some women came by and snatched her plate of food away.  She still had her food on it, and the woman never asked if we wanted it taken away.  The woman was wearing a pink polo shirt, so she looked more like one of the managers than a server.  We thought about complaining, but it just felt like maybe it wasn't worth it.  

Not to look to much into this, but I wonder if the place is having financial issues, so the food is not as good and the people are on edge.  Either way, it's a shame because this was a regular place for us to hang out for a nice dinner out, and we would usually grab some stuff from the store after the meal.  We may give it once last chance, maybe this was an off night, but it feels like the magic might be gone from this one."}
{"text":"I've only been for Happy Hour, but it's always been a great experience! I love that their happy hour runs from 4 - 7 PM (Yardhouse and Brio both end at 6 PM so it's really tough to make it there after work!). 

Drinks:
*The ones with banana were too overpowering for us. I hate that they put sprite in a mojito. It's simple syrup + club soda idiots! The sangria is decent but has lots of brandy, so make sure you're ok with that before ordering. The favorite was the mai thai - still super sweet like the other drinks, but at least had some nice tart citrus to balance it out. Honestly the drinks are relatively disappointing - I would expect perfect fruity drinks from a place inspired by Tommy Bahama's. Drinks average ~$6 during happy hour

Food (All of these are $5 during HH)

*Coconut Shrimp -while it only comes with 3 shrimp, they were amazing! My fiance is a coconut shrimp freak and declared these the best he'd ever eaten. We ordered a 2nd order of these as soon as we tasted them. The papaya mango sauce they are sitting in is awesome too. 
*Pork sliders - we found the pork dried out and over cooked. Fail. 
*Cheeseburgers - could use more cheese, and they were overcooked, but otherwise these are pretty damn tasty. I'd get them again. 
*Quesadilla - Yum! Lots of chicken and deliciousness inside. Decent portion, etc. Recommended. 

Love the cool classical music they play, love the vibe. Drinks could use a little work, but food was overall great. Officially added onto my regular happy hour rotation!"}
{"text":"Overall experiences was amazing - Dominique was great... 
Our server Dominique greeted us with a energetic smile, she let us know the special drink  of the day - lemon drop martini - which I ordered - he ordered a mojito as usual - Both drinks were great. While waiting for our meal, we were served warm bread w/ honey butter... Delicious - I had the COOPER ISLAND CRAB BISQUE - if you ever want to try a bit of heaven try this bisque, it is so creamy and good... He had a salad, this is going to sound funny, but the croutons was the best I ever had - fresh and crunchy... 

Our entrees arrived - He ordered the Special Filet Mignons
Grilled, red wine demi-glace, roasted garlic, Maytag bleu cheese with grilled lemon garlic asparagus & roasted fingerling potatoes - His enjoyed his food was cooked perfect

I ordered  SANIBEL STUFFED CHICKEN - 
Parmesan-Japanese breadcrumb encrusted, stuffed with herb cheese & roasted red pepper,roasted red pepper cream sauce with sauteed seasonal vegetables... It was different from any stuffed chicken that I have ever had - I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stuffed chicken

I could barely  finish my food it was a great experiences, excellent food, amazing service and the atmosphere there was out of this world... I love Tommy Bahama's"}
{"text":"Came here on my last night I'm Vegas.  I started with a Vodka martini,  they had Blue Cheese Olives!!!  That was a huge plus in my book as they leave a great taste in the vodka.  For dinner I had a 702 burger With spiced bacon and a sunny side up egg on it.  Twas absolutely delicious! The service was fantastic, so Tommy Bahama gets 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"*a bar lounge/restaurant review* 

Unfortunately the waitress we got stuck with ruined the entire Tommy Bahama experience. Poor attitude, neglected us all night, screwed up the order and since she never stopped by to check how our meal was after it was delivered, well we never got to tell her. Water cups not once refilled. 

The food, exceptional. I only got one drink and one appetizer (won ton tuna tacos). The drink was amazing. The tacos were good but won-ton shells are probably not the best case for tacos- they break easy and the contents just spill everywhere. Smh. 

If I come here again, it'll be for happy hour and drinks only."}
{"text":"It seems hard to believe that any of the four founders of Tommy Bahama could have realized just how big their brand would grow back in 1993, but having since merged with a larger company the store has nevertheless grown into a worldwide enterprise focused on \"island-style living,\" over 150 stores and counting with several harboring their own Restaurant and the company even manufacturing their own label of Rum.

Known for their love of khaki and Hawaiian button-ups with leisurewear bleeding over to a whole line of home décor, nothing in particular suggesting the desert but still sold in five retail outlets plus department stores throughout Sin City, it was during a recent trip to Town Square that the decision was made to investigate Lunch on the patio adjacent a recently erected Christmas Tree, the breezy environment befitting the concept without feeling overly \"themed.\"  

Toqued by Chef Ruben Vasquez Cruz and second-in-command Armando Vargas, the much-talked about Happy Hour, fresh Fish \"flown in daily\" and a substantial Cocktail list forming the backbone of a menu expectedly intended to please a broad audience, it was mere moments after checking in at the hostess stand that a four-top under umbrellas was offered on the restaurant's patio, a list of daily Chef's specials offered in addition to the typical bill of fare with most of the choices centered around Fresh Seafood.

Apologetic up front when stating that both service and the kitchen were understaffed on this particular afternoon, a rush of traffic completely filling outdoor seating with several additional groups and families sat in the spacious dining room or around a bar area displaying NCAA Football, it was still with relative efficiency that a middle-aged man from Florida took orders for drinks while additionally keeping up with refills of Water, first taste offered in the form of a foamy Pina Colada entitled \"Coconut Cloud\" alongside the refreshing Cucumber Smash and a \"No Proof\" Martini that tasted like Cuban Café con Leche with a gentle Citrus note.

Ready to place an order fairly quickly, the aforementioned staffing situation delaying the arrival of a warm basket of Rolls with Honey Butter until later, it was as the group watched several folks posing around the tree that six jumbo shrimp dipped in shredded Coconut Batter arrived alongside a Half-Rack of Ribs for the youngster, the \"World Famous\" item par for the course atop a dollop of tropical Chutney while the slab of Pork was tender and moist beneath sweet glaze, the sugar outweighing any suggestion of \"spice\" a theme that would be repeated throughout the meal.

Offering several menu items including daily specials in two sizes, the smaller suggested as an \"appetizer\" but equally appropriate as an entree for those with modest appetites, it was alongside a sharable bowl of Fish Soup that had unfortunately boiled too long that a $15 Flatbread arrived, the unannounced pile of Arugula seemingly unnecessary at first but presumably added to balance the Honey-soaked Onions that would have otherwise overwhelmed everything including the texturally pleasing Mushrooms and medium rare Beef. 

Rounding out entrees with a three-piece order of Jumbo Prawns, their snappy flesh and a bit of smoke from the grill a vast improvement from the rubbery Scallop or Shrimp from the Soup, Chefs Cruz and Vargas showed a deft hand when preparing Pearl Cous Cous with fresh Vegetables and light Cream plus tender Mushrooms, the quality of each ingredient as well as the preparation as a whole on par with what one might find further up the Strip for at least $10 more.

Told to \"save room for Dessert,\" a mock-display near the front door brought tableside to assure a sale that was already guaranteed, it was alongside a Double Espresso poured over Ice that three of the Tommy Bahama's signatures were selected, the Peanut Butter Pie eaily the richest with a thick and creamy base balanced by finishing salt as well as the pulverized Pretzel Crust while two tropical choices proved even better, the Pina Colada Cake fragrant and moist without being too dense while the Crème Brulee made from caramelized Pulp and Vanilla Custard re-inserted into the hollowed Rind may just be the best version served in Las Vegas.

***1/2 Dollar for dollar and plate for plate Tommy Bahama Restaurant and Bar occupies a position somewhere between the likes of Cheesecake Factory or Elephant Bar and places like Joe's Stone Crab or Aquanox on The Strip, certainly not \"destination\" dining but at the same time far better than it needs to be for an upscale dining option in an shopping mall."}
{"text":"The best happy hour drinks. Also, the food is great. Every time we visit Vegas we eat and drink at this establishment. I highly recommend this restaurant. Today a blues duet is playing and they are talented. I only have positive comments regarding this restaurant. I truly enjoy the food. drinks, and ambience."}
{"text":"Yes, clothes but that's on one side:) the middle has an airy bar, lounge area and with some televisions so one can watch sporting events!  Outdoor patio is adjacent wth the dining area. Always friendly service in the bar area and dining area. Wouldn't know about the retail clothing area (not a floral print person). Island happy hour menu is EVERY day, yep and from 4pm-7pm. Will post a picture of that menu for you. Today our bartender is Julian and he sold my friend on his whiskey smash with blueberries. She will post a review of her drink from her Yelp account for you!  The blackened fish tacos are always a must, and the coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere except for the occasional planes going by that can be rather loud. I've been for lunch as well as dinner. Great service, great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This review is for the store, as I've never eaten in the restaurant. My husband loves Tommy Bahama clothing so we browse here frequently. 

I've purchased clothing from here in the past and some of the clothing is great quality. I love the swimsuits! My husband gets a lot of wears out of his stuff and I notice that some of his shirts pill and come apart after a lot of washes and wears in a shorter period of time. Maybe he's too rough on his clothing but so many of his shirts have pulls and loose threads. I do not expect this from such pricey apparel. 

The customer service here is good. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. Sometimes a little too much so. I'm the type who likes to browse without being bothered. A simple, \"let me know if I can help with anything,\" and then walk away is completely my style. The \"what can I help you find, what are you shopping for, blah blah\" approach is too much for me. 

This store just makes me think of vacation every time I walk in, and that puts a smile on my face!!"}
{"text":"Overall it's what I expected for a Caribbean upscale bar. The complementary bread was good and hot. Not a fan of honey butter on french rolls, but the waitress brought butter which I liked better. The drinks were refreshing. Our marinated and grilled artichokes were charred black. And not just grill marks. We brought this to the attention of the waitress. She said she would take it back if we didn't like it after trying it. But I believe the cook shouldn't have left this for us to decide. As an upscale establishment, it shouldn't have been served this way. We had other food that was good but unremarkable."}
{"text":"Bahia Sangria.... Sangria with a little brandy....
Yum.... Ahi Poke & fish tacos.... delicious. Happy hour...."}
{"text":"I was out in the sun the whole day working on my tan. Tropical was the only word that came to mind for what I wanted for dinner after such a wonderful day of nothing. With that being said, Tommy Bahamas was the go to choice for happy hour. From 4pm-7pm, they run a deal on six food options and maybe ten drink specials. The food runs from $5-$7 and the drinks from $6-$7.

I got the ahi poke, fish tacos, and a mojito. The poke is nothing spectacular. In fact, it is rather puny. The same goes for the macadamia goat cheese. The fish tacos are as amazing as Philip T. makes them out to be."}
{"text":"A large group of us got together here to celebrate some friends birthdays. The staff was very accommodating, our group had about 30 people and were able to keep us all together. The staff was polite and even with all of the guests they had to take care of, did really well at  making sure no one had to wait for food or go thirsty. Very efficient staff.
I started with a Millionaires Mai Tai, which was very good, so I ended up getting a 2nd during dinner. I ordered a bowl of Crab Bisque, for the price (9.50) seemed like a small amount but it's very rich and think, so a cup would've been a better choice for me. It was very smooth and creamy, with a hint of crab taste. It was good but I don't think I'd get it again. For my meal I opted for the \"World Famous Coconut Shrimp\"(16.50) not sure why it's famous, I've had coconut shrimp elsewhere many times and this wasn't the best by far.The shrimp was cooked well, not greasy or anything, it was just not anything special, and the papaya mango chutney seemed too sweet to dip the shrimp in.  On a good not, My husband got the Cuban Sandwich (13.50)...wow! I would've never thought to order a Cuban somewhere like this, it was very good, a little messy but lots of flavor. We both agree we'd go back just for that!
The staff was nice enough to let us bring our own cake, they cut it and served it as well. 
Everyone had a good time, we sang Happy Birthday, ate cake and enjoyed good conversation in a pleasant setting."}
{"text":"I could give this place a 4 but.....BUT the Manager of all of people made the experience so awkward.  The unemployment rate is so high EVERYWHERE that there are plenty of people who look better and posses so much more professionalism than NATALIE!  yes, Natalie.  She'll remember from the table she was so rude to earlier this evening.  Katie, an amazing server, split a salad that me and my bf had ordered.  When the food was being brought to the table half of a salad was brought out and our entire table laughed bc it looked so small.  Natalie then replies to our cackle by saying \"what?... I couldn't bring both salads out\"  rolls eyes and walks off.  She left us at the table stunned, we became more stunned as were were informed she was the manager of the establishment.  What nerve for a woman who is clearly dressed inappropriately (wearing a sleeveless shirt without the body to go with this type of top). 

 I yelped this as promised, and if it werent for the cool server the tip would have almost been non existent.  Natalie, if you dont like your job quit.  Its a waste of your time and patrons when you take your unhappiness out on us.  

As for the food, it was yummy.  The regular menu is definitely over-priced but the bar is a great place to go for happy hour with  live hawaiian style music playing in the background."}
{"text":"every time I go to Vegas this is my #1 hang out place I want to go to eat!! best food, service is great, its in a outdoor mall is my fav part to go shopping then I will go eat at tommy Bahamas!! and it has happy hour 4-7pm!! 1st timers going here u will fall in love with it when u take the first bite of the food u order!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and decently priced, but their drinks are WAY overpriced - even for a trendy area of Vegas. $35 for a sipping rum? This isn't a nightclub, come on. That was literally half my tab. There are 12 sipping drinks in a fifth. The bottle of rum costs $100. At $20 a glass they would still make 140% profit on the bottle and you would leave with some dignity instead of feeling taken advantage of. but instead they shoot for 320% profit on the bottle and lost a customer who otherwise would have been back in a heartbeat. Different strategies for different people I guess"}
{"text":"I love tommy Bahamas! However I give this place 3 stars because the Tommy Bahamas in Newport gave me the biggest impression and I fell in love with them but this Tommy Bahamas is just as good just missing a little something I'm looking for...just don't know what it is. However, the atmosphere is nice, the shopping mall that it's located in beautiful so you can definitely eat and shop here!"}
{"text":"This was an opportunity to try a new place, this seemed a little bit different for us, my husband and I usually avoid places like this. We've had the \"real thing\", island cuisine that is, so we were a bit shy at trying anything that might be a knock off, but I actually enjoyed it. 

We were seated right away, the bar had cozy booths that were available, and our server was also the bar keep. She took our drink and appetizers order right away, and the food was swift to come our way. 

We had the crab cakes, which had a very beautiful presentation. The green and red sauces were sweet chili sauce and olive oil. Then on top of that was cole slaw with a vinegar dressing. Then two golden brown crab cakes stacked on that. I thought the crab cake was really good, I had big bites of crab which I love, and the sweet chili sauce made it zesty. I don't think my husband cared for this dish, his comments were \"it's too sweet\". 

We also tried the fried goat cheese, with macadamia nuts and soy sauce glaze. I love the bold flavors. It was served over a bed of diced mango's. The cracker served with it was a little thin, since the goat cheese has pretty strong flavor a thicker wafer would be better. 

We both tried the Cuban sandwich with fried yucca. The sandwich came cut on the diagonal and it was difficult to eat, as each bit I lost a little bit of the insides, the meat and pickles kept sliding off. The yucca fries were light golden brown, and had a very different texture, it looked like fries, but it was very soft when biting into the wedge. The texture was too much for me, so I gave most of my fries to my husband. 

I did enjoy the meal, I thought the flavors were good, the service was excellent, as our server took good care of us, but I did feel it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how much I liked dining at Tommy Bahama's! My boyfriend and I opted for patio seating, which has a very relaxed, tropical vibe. Later in the evening, they even had a live performer who sang and played guitar. 

We came for Happy Hour (which is from 4-7 pm) and ordered the Bahia Sangria, Mojito, Duo Dip of Chips, Sliders, Blackened Fish Tacos, and Pork Rib Entree. My sangria came out with a pretty flower and it was strong enough to do the job. The waitress told us that everything they serve is fresh and cooked in house - which was apparent when we saw tasted the food.

The Duo Dip of Chips are just chips with fresh guacamole and zesty cheese. I was surprised at how well the cheese came out! I never had that type before and that's certainly not the last time. The Sliders are the miniature versions of their real burgers and come with BBQ sauce, bacon, onion, tomato and lettuce. The Blackened Fish Tacos were amazing!! They gave us quite a bit of high quality fish! The Pork Rib entree gives you about 6 ribs with mashed potatoes and asian cole slaw. The ribs were cooked tenderly and the sauce was spot-on. I would recommend all of these items! The happy hour items were very affordable - about $5-8 each. The entrees are more expensive as expected, ranging around $18-30. 

Since it was Valentine's Day weekend as well, they also offered a trio of desserts for $10 that included strawberry panna cotta, chocolate cake with oreos, and red velvet cake. The panna cotta was my least favorite - I think the strawberry made it more tart than I'm used to. I definitely over-indulged with the rest of the cakes though! :) 

My waitress offered amazing service and was very friendly. The only downside about the whole night wasn't due to the food or even my own waitress but was because another waitress rudely refused to take a picture for us. I don't think I've met a waitress who has been so unwilling to help before. Other than that negative aspect, I highly recommend trying this place out for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the staff was on point.  They recommended food that was exactly what we were looking for and it all came out in a timely manner.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you shopped all day and are dying in the desert of Vegas for sustenance, you find it at Tommy Bahama. The food is awesome (Chicken lolipops, fish tacos, breaded fried mango). The service is awesome.  The desert is great (key lime pie)."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Saw on Yelp that it had 4 stars. Checked it out. Great service. Great food. Our server Adam was awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some noshies and and drinks. Good service and decent food. The decor is what you would expect from Tommy Bahama -- the Florida Keys circa 1955. It's attached to the store, so you can cruise by afterward and pick up a silk shirt and some sandals."}
{"text":"The original plan was to do Brio's happy hour but they only had food specials and no discounts on drinks that day.  Might as well just call it apathy hour.  We had never been here so thought we'd finally give it a shot.  

Fish tacos were the big standout of the happy hour menu.  These are the kind of tacos you imagine eating while vacationing at a beach resort.  I could've eaten 6 of them.  Ahi tuna was also good.  Judging by other patrons around us, the sliders were the most popular so we'll try that on a future visit.  Drinks were fruity and strong although none were too memorable (cause and effect?).  

They also had a guy doing acoustic guitar renditions of songs by the likes of Van Morrison, Coldplay and the Chili Peppers.  I would've requested Stephen Bishop if we had stayed longer."}
{"text":"We never come to Las Vegas without stopping here.  If a restaurant can be a vacation unto itself, this is the place. 
MAIN COURSES These are huge and delicious (notably the fish tacos, crispy fish sandwich and macadamia nut crusted salmon to name the ones I've tried.)
APPETIZERS Instead of the large entrees, I prefer to order an appetizer (such as the Ahi tuna tacos or Ahi poki Napoleon) and salad (the bungalow salad sounds simple, but it's SO delicious!) so I have more room for the so amazing cocktails and dessert--more on those later.  My husband adores the chicken tortilla soup and the seared scallop sliders.  And we always order the macadamia crusted goat cheese, even though we have the cookbook and make it at home from time to time. 
I should mention that I'm allergic to shellfish, so I can't eat shrimp, scallops, crab, lobster, etc., but I never feel deprived here, even though TB Café places a strong emphasis on seafood in general.  THANK YOU!
COCKTAILS  These are heaven.  Like vacation in a glass.  Best pina colada anywhere.  Yummy mojitos.  A key lime martini to die for.  Blood orange margarita--yes, please.  My husband ordered none of these, but was very happy with his order.  (Hmm, memory of beverages consumed is a little foggy, wonder why?)
DESSERT:  I keep trying to resist the key lime pie to try something different, but I can't do it.  My husband has ordered the pina colada cake and loved it, but his current favorite is the pineapple creme brulee served in a thick slice of carmelized pineapple.  I would love to try the malted chocolate pie or the peanut butter pie, but the key lime pie has a hold on me...
SERVICE:  So warm, welcoming & attentive without being overly familiar.  They're happy to carry on a conversation about food if you engage them, or they'll drop off your cocktail & appetizer and just keep an eye out for when your head pops up or your drink gets low.  My understanding is that a lot of the staff has been here since they opened (close to 10 years ago) and that tells me they treat their staff well, and their staff is loyal to them.  With plenty of other restaurants & bars in the LV area, that's saying something impressive.  I believe our server's name was Matt, and he was perfect.
DECOR:  I'm not exaggerating when I say we have seriously investigated decorating our home in a similar style.  Love the tropical wallpaper, the combination of dark and painted-white woods, the floral pillows in the wooden booths, etc.  It's a relaxing color palette with colors of sand, golden pineapple, and shades of green, much like resorts we've visited in Hawaii and Florida.
MANAGEMENT:  We met the sales manager Kaaren Kragerud for the first time during this last visit, and she's the real deal.  She spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about the offerings at the restaurant and at the store, and overall put a friendly human touch on an already great experience.  She's amazing, and we'll ask if she's in when we visit from now on.  
SUMMARY:  Just go."}
{"text":"Always take ant opportunity to visit Tommy Bahama Restaurant. This one doesn't disappoint. A little off the strip and with all of the favorites. Service is great food is always outstanding. Don't miss when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The crab bisque is amazing and the chicken sandwich was really good as well. It's got a nice atmosphere. They give you a postcard you can fill out and they mail it anywhere you want which I felt was a unique and fun thing."}

But after sitting at the table for 15 minutes with no service..No one even approached the table I understood why. The service is sub par and the staff is obviously not well trained. The funny part is that when we walked out they thanked us for coming ... clueless!"}

{"text":"Our flight came in late, it took forever to get our luggage and rental car... by 3pm, we were hungry and ready to chow down. We Yelped dog friendly restaurant with minimum 4 star rating and near the Vegas airport and Yelp directed us hete. The receptionist and waitress were friendly and personable and that's a good first impression. Since we've never been to a Tommy Bahamas restaurant, we asked our waitess what she recommended. Even though she did mention that the appetizer and salad could be a meal in itself (warning to us ), we ordered all her recommendations because we were ready to chow at 3pm for lunch. We started with their fillet mignon flatbread (excellent suggestion) appetizer, lump crab and avocado salad (perfect, love the light dressing) and finished with the blacken fish tacos. We couldn't finish all the food and would have love dessert, but our belts were popping. We will come here again on our next trip and will make sure I leave room for the key lime pie. Our waitress's friendly and personable demeanor made it a 5 star experience. She was very attentive but not overbearing. Being a dog friendly restaurant a big plus."}
{"text":"Town Square in Las Vegas - a \"shopping, dining and entertainment center\" - has the attraction of being less tourist-ridden than, for instance, The Strip, so I often go there if my itinerary finds me routing through Sin City.

I was somewhat surprised to see that Tommy Bahama - which I thought to be a retail store - had a bar/restaurant there, but as it was a Friday night and waiting times were pronounced at other restaurants, thought I'd give it a go.

And I was very pleased I did :-)

The food - ironically for a venue in the middle of a desert! - is seafood focused, was well thought out, well presented and tasty.

And the service was good.

So I'd mark this as 4* / commended (which is about as good as it gets for a chain restaurant - I have to declare my personal prejudices make it unlikely I will ever give 5* to something that is a Cookie Cutter artefact)."}
{"text":"This is located in the center of Town Square and is attached to their retail outlet. We arrived at 11am when they opened on Sunday and we were seated immediately.  Our server was friendly and kept track of us with refilling our water and soda before we even asked. He even made recommendations on drinks and foods. We share with him it was our first time and he was happy to walk us through the menu and specials.  I rested the Vegetable Seasonal Plate which was amazing. I felt so healthy after eating it. And my partner ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with French fries. Wow taste great and reasonably priced relative to the other restaurants nearby. We are locals and will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The location was perfect. Also the restaurant smelled great. If you like vanilla and coconut. The restaurant itself was nice. We sat in the patio which was perfect for a hot Vegas night. My only problem was the menu. Nothing really there. Everything looked or sounded bland. Very small variety. And nuts in every dish on the menu. I wish the menu had more to offer, cause the place was great."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place -- Town Square that is. It does not seem like you are in Vegas anymore -- horse and carriage rides, a train for the kids, a lawn for people to gather on, and for us -- a place to eat outside to watch all of this by. 

The food at Tommy's was as good as ever and the only thing missing was the great entertainment of the place in Naples FL. They did have something going on inside but the tables outside we just too inviting to opt for the music instead of the outdoor space. The finishing touch would be to have the same kind of layout as Naples but alas it does not.

The service was outstanding and for the first night in town it was a great way to unwind, enjoy the food, and enjoy the sights without all of the craziness of the strip."}
{"text":"We stopped into Tommy Bahama's for lunch because we had previously enjoyed our experience here and we were again pleased. The food is delicious, the service attentive, the atmosphere pleasant and the overall experience is a good value.
I ordered the fish sandwich and was extremely pleased. The fish was prepared in a light batter and was about twice the size of the bun on which it was served. Moreover, it was quite thick making the portion a very substantial and filling main course in the meal. 
The Fish Tacos my wife ordered featured plenty of fresh fish, nicely grilled rather than battered or fried, and like my fish sandwich, made for a good meal experience."}
{"text":"Tropical paradise and fantastic staff!

The service here is amazing, the staff is friend and the food is wonderful.

I got here just in time for happy hour. What a fun menu! There are 5-6 different foods choice on the happy hour menu, 5 different martinis and 5 different cocktails.

I had a a pineapple martini, and a taste of the ahi poke and the sliders. All if which were amazing. 

The sliders came with the usual fixings, but if you're a tommy regular, they used to come with fried onion sting... Which is the way we ordered them! So much better. 

Can't go wrong with this pit stop. It's nice because it's off the strip, and it's a little break from the hustle bustle of the strip grind. It is located in a little strip mall, so some good walking around after a full stomach."}
{"text":"Food: world famous coconut shrimp, Thai curry shrimp and scallops, baby back BBQ pork ribs, kids margherita pizza, special of the day seafood bisque, key lime pie, triple chocolate cake, chocolate ganache cake. 

The best items were the coconut shrimp, Thai curry and key lime pie. I would go there just to eat the key lime pie. So limey and refreshing and the graham cracker crust was perfection with the perfect amount of salt. YUM. The. Best. Ever. Nice big slice too enough for two to share. 

Ambiance: really cute island feel. Made me feel like I'm on vacation in Hawaii or some tropical place. 

Service: a little slow in checking in on us, but overall satisfactory. The waitress brought my daughter an extra amuse bouche, which was appreciated. 

Location: conveniently located inside Town Square near the open green area."}
{"text":"The food and beverages here are top shelf.  Nice ambiance and patio.  Great attentive servers.  Cocktail menu is a delight (too many sweet drinks).  Appetizers are tasty, imaginative and plentiful.  Crab bisque is to die for.  The seafood and meat dishes are delicious.  Desserts are yummy, especially the key lime pie.  Restaurant keeps you in that laid-back Tommy Bahama mood."}
{"text":"Sooo...after my second time at Tommy Bahama's, I thought I would review the place. I ordered the Rustic Pasta, which I have tried before in a red sauce from friend's plate. I remember it being amazing pasta, I was quite surprise that pasta could be this good at Tommy Bahama's, after all they just sell clothes. Anyway...I ordered the Rustic Pasta for myself this time. I was quite disappointed with the dish this time around. They had changed the whole dish! It was basically a sour soup with tomatoes and pasta. Ew. My friend ordered the same thing and was quite disappointed too.

We called the server over to politely ask if there was a reason why the pasta tasted the way it did, and why it had changed from before. The server, also named Tommy did not hesitate to give us the menu to change our order. I ordered the special, Parm crusted mahi mahi and green beans and lemon infused rice. 

By the time the second dish came out it had two hours since we sat down...I was starving. I tool a bit of the fish and it was meh, I took a bit of the lemon infused rice and it tasted like soap. I swear if the establishment isn't Indian or Asian-decent they EFF the rice up!! I swear. I decided just eat the mediocre fish and green beans off my plate and call it a day. At this point I was so exhausted from waiting for dinner I had the server just pack it. I figured I could re-purpose the food to look and taste like something else.

I hear their happy hour is good for tacos and run drinks. Will stay away from Tommy Bahama's (if I can help it)."}
{"text":"On this July 2011 trip to Vegas, my husband and I decided to do some shopping and get some dinner at Town Square before checking into our hotel. Town Square is located between McCarran Airport and the Strip...but that's for another Yelp review...on to the Tommy Bahama's review...

It's a store...and it's a restaurant/bar! We decided on eating here because of the atmosphere..like you're on a Caribbean vacation. There's palm trees, ceiling fans, white shutters..and it wasn't very crowded. The menu made my mouth water and I couldn't decide what to get. So since we were on vacation we decided to not hold back! Ready for this? We ordered and shared the Ahi Tuna Tacos, Seared Scallop Sliders, Coconut-Crusted Crab Cakes, the Crab Bisque, the Mushroom & Onion Kobe Burger and a salad (which I really could have done without but thought I'd get something light and \"healthy\" haha). The food was to die for!! The Ahi Tuna Tacos were yummy, in crunchy wonton shells with some asian slaw and wasabi-lime avocados. The scallop sliders were my favorite because they were good sized scallops that were juicy and seemed to melt in my mouth. The crispy onions that were with it gave it a tasty crunch. Oh and the Mushroom & Kobe Burger was amazing, and I'm not a big burger fan. That was a whole lot of food for just the 2 of us but we pretty much polished it off (except for the salad) and had no room for dessert.

I really wanted a mojito but it wasn't on the drink menu. So I asked our waiter if there was any possibility that the bartender could make one for me and sure enough they did! I was very satisfied and had a second one. ;)

I look forward to eating here again on our next trip to Vegas, but the next time saving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Tommy Bahamas Restaurant while living on Maui (Wailea).  I always enjoyed that location and I was surprised to stumble upon T.B.'s here in the middle of the desert. I thought it was a mirage at first sight. Just as I remembered from da island. Very tasty food and impressive cocktails all in a beautiful West Indies style dining room right in the middle of Town Square. Only problem.....it's on the other side of town so I can only hope for a location here in Summerlin. I like the crabcakes and one of their signature salads. Add a rum cocktail and if you close your eyes, you just might think you have escaped to a very nice island."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite happy hour in Las Vegas! Sit on the patio and chill. Food is fantastic and the drink options are pretty great too! We have been here a few times within the past month or so and it does not get old. Service is great me food is consistent. Great for groups me even the little ones.... I keep mine outside. 

Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas traveling and visiting my sister.  Before we went out on the town we decided to stop by Tommy Bahama's for dinner.  There was a bit of wait so my friend and I decided to grab a drink at the bar.  When you walk in the shop, bar, and restaurant are all right next to each other.  Kind of interesting.  

While waiting on the bartender we listened to a live solo singer and his guitar. Usually these people are either loud, annoying or bad but this guy had just the right sound. He played alternative, rock, and pop music.  Things that people could sing along to.  I really liked him.  I ordered a Mojito which was soooo delicious.  Bartenders usually don't know how to make a good tasting Mojito. This lady did!   Anyways, our table was ready within 5 minutes. They sat us down by an open door. It was, of course, nice outside.  

I ordered a salad and within 15 minutes it came out. Honestly this had to be the best salad I've ever had.  It had steak and some potato and whatever dressing they used was to die for. I wasn't  that hungry coming in, but after my first bite I couldn't stop myself. I wanted more! I couldn't  allow myself to order dessert knowing I'd devour it.   Who knew the original clothing store could create an amazing restaurant. They need more of these in Chicago!  

Well next time I'm back in Vegas Im definitely stopping by Tommy's.  I want more salad and I want it now!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 star, the food is good, however, way too pricy for what it is.  We shared two meals amongst four people and we payed around 30 bucks each!   Next time i'll go, i'll just stick to the bar with the live acoustic music."}
{"text":"Was just ok. Went this afternoon for a late lunch with the hubby. Service & atmosphere was great, the food just ok. Got the goat cheese appetizer, I didn't care for it due to some odd after taste. Hubby enjoyed & finished it. The complimentary bread & cinnamon butter was good. Crab bisque soup was good, very rich. Coconut shrimp appetizer was good too but not sure what's \"world famous\" about em. Hubby said the philly steak tacos were just ok as well. He only finished 2/3 which is rare for him. Overall I think it was ok not a bad experience and didn't think it was a waste of time or money but probably won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner with my coworkers and spouses. We had an entire room to ourselves. I saw the menu beforehand to try and prepare my choice but once we got there and ordered some appetizers it was difficult. Everything looked so good! I didn't order the appetizers so I'm not sure exactly what they were called but they were coconut shrimp, some sort of chicken drumstick, a quesadilla, and a flatbread with pear and cheese. All of them were amazing but the coconut shrimp was the clear winner. I ordered the seared ahi with succotash and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The crust on the ahi was chili and brown sugar which was amazing and I loved the veggies. He loved the fish but the \"chips\" left something to be desired. For dessert I ordered the pineapple creme brûlée and he ordered a chocolate tart. Both were amazing but the chocolate one was so rich we had to bring it home for the next day. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The service was extraordinary!  ESPECIALLY for Vegas, where I've been disappointed time after time.  (We go out at least once a week, and find the service in this city atrocious).

Water, check, bread basket, yummy, check, attentive service, check, great drinks, check...

JB ordered the special, some kind of creole Mahi Mahi which he found excellent. (I don't eat fish, but it was beautifully presented) and a caesar salad, which was the real deal.

A friend and I'd had a late lunch so we shared a basket of fries (nice fresh cut fries) and I ordered the Tortola Tortilla Soup, wonderfully filling, very generous bowl, savory and our friend ordered the Cooper Island Crab Bisque, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

It's a bit pricey, but worth an occasional splurge.  Live steel drum music, and I was transported to an island or the Florida Keys... aaaahhhhhhhh!  Lovely."}
{"text":"My go-to place! It's so relaxing to get a delicious drink and sit on the patio or by the windows and people watch. It's a great location, the food has always been excellent, and the service has always been top notch. I've never been disappointed here. 
The fish tacos are my usual but the fish and chips and the 702 burger are also great. I hope to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with my cousins for the first time. Good food, drinks, and great atmosphere. Will definitely be back with hubby."}
{"text":"Before I get into my review, I just want to preface that this rating is for happy hour.

Happy hour is from 4-7p all day errrday, which is pretty convenient.

I ordered the smoked salmon, fish tacos, ahi poke, crab bisque soup, chick lollipop, and the crab cake.  I had the sangria and cantaloupe martini to drink.

The food was just ok.  I didn't fall in love with any of the dishes we had, and thought that it was still too pricey for what it was.  I can't imagine paying full price for any of those dishes.

The lollipop chicken was dry, sauce was ok, mango salad it came with was good.
Ahi poke and smoked salmon dishes were ok, but I didn't like the chips they came with.  Plantain chips would've been a better choice to serve with.  I thought the fish tacos lacked seasoning, flavor, sauce;  all I tasted was the flour tortilla.  Crab cake had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much sweet chili sauce.  It over powered the crab cake, which was too salty anyway.  Lastly, the crab bisque!  Disgusting.  I tried this cause it seemed to be a favorite dish on yelp reviews.  It was really difficult for me to eat because they went wayyyyy to heavy on the cream.  I really felt like puking after.  I would not recommend this dish.  The drinks were ok.  Sangria wasn't really a sangria.  No fruit, just cheap red wine mixed with fruit juice and water I suppose.  Cantaloupe martini was good, but way to sweet.  I think they should've held back on some of the melon liqueur.  Probably would've tasted better if they used real cantaloupe juice.

Service was friendly, but slightly inattentive.  No big deal cause he had the whole bar to take care of, plus the tables.  Didn't bring us the bread in the beginning, but did offer it half way through the meal.  I told him i'd like some, but he never brought it.  Asked for it after our meal was done, cause I wanted to taste the apple butter.  Had to flag someone else down for our check.

Overall, I will probably not come back because I didn't care for the food we had.  I tried to sample as much as I could from the HH and appetizer list.  Based on what I had and the price, there are other restaurants in Vegas I'd rather spend my money on.  That's it."}
{"text":"Dropping my review down to a single star. Here's why: 

Came here at my suggestion for a good friend's birthday dinner last week. Her salmon dinner was ridiculously under cooked. We sent it back and another was brought out, but this should've never happened, let alone on her birthday. It was never mentioned or offered to be refunded. 

Tonight I dined with my children, and my daughter was halfway through her burger when I noticed it too was severely undercooked. We ordered a medium burger, and it was very RAW. I felt bad that I hadn't noticed it earlier, but again: it should've never been served this raw. My son ordered the same burger and it too was raw. Our waitress did remove one burger from our bill, but why not both? Both burgers were undercooked! She didn't even pretend to care. We had a horrible, neglected dinner. I guess we weren't worthy enough to offer the dessert tray to either. I didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I did leave a crappy one. Very disappointed, because I come here often and these back to back poor experiences just left me angry. 

I don't know what the hell happened to this place. But two visits in one week and awful food is unacceptable. Where is the accountability in the kitchen?!?! Stop sending out under-cooked food! 

Love the rum drinks here, but we won't be back. Just rotten.  :-("}
{"text":"Perfect place to stop after shopping for lunch and cocktails. We started out with the coconut shrimps; they were delicious.  The bacon cheese burger was average; but the blackened fish tacos were outstanding. Nice atmosphere and different. Staffs were friendly and attentive. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"Waitor Ron L and his Apprentice were Excellent! Town Square Tommy Bahama! We were treated with Exceptional care and we received a gift  as well!"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner their with some friends.  The food was VERY good, wait staff was friendly, professional, attentive, and  knowledgable of the menu.
The atmosphere is good for a small gathering or large crowds."}
{"text":"I would love to go here again because of the relaxed ambience and delicious food. My boyfriend and I visited this location to have an early dinner and absolutely loved it . While the waiter was missing most of the time, he timed his visits to our table perfectly. We ordered a filet mignon flat bread, Branzino, and a slice of pina colada cake. Everything was superb and yummy. Despite my allergies to some of the things in the dishes we ordered, I would do it all over again. The corniness of the fake Hawaiian scenery was cute and reminded me of shops and tourist destinations from back home. Kudos to them for making me feel like I was home without the humidity."}
{"text":"Cinnamon Honey Butter!

When a restaurant changes the way I shop and eat, this is a 5 star all the way. This was a life changer. I never gave much thought to butter and bread. Then I was surprised! Wow, I enjoyed Cinnamon Honey Butter a lot. I need to up my butter game.

The food was good. Considering how pricey Vegas is, I am so grateful for keeping the food prices reasonable. The gambling life can be hard on people especially when you get a bad beat. I ordered the burger w/ french fries. The burger was made medium rare. There were plenty of beef on the burger and everything tasted great. I tried some vegas food on the strip and it is just simply overpriced by a lot. Tommy Bahama delivered on high quality food while providing great services w/o emptying the bank account."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for you amazing hospitality and support of Safe Nest and Nevadas Big Give! The staff the food everything was amazing! Thanks for supporting our community."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service and good food. It was a fun early dinner and i do recommend this place."}
{"text":"This particular Tommy Bahama's has come quite a ways since I first tried it a few years back.  Their drinks are not only bearable now, they are actually delightful!  The food has always been good BUT the Crab BISQUE is lick the plate exquisite!  I always enjoy the bungalow salad with chicken.  The Leap of Faith is my favorite drink because I love the jalapeño!  The service has always been satisfactory."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour but ended up ordering mostly from the main menu. The only item I ordered from the HH menu was the Ahi Poke. It was served on top of guacamole and came with 3 crispy chips. It was pretty good but wish it was a bigger portion. The main entrees, I had their 8oz filet mignon, med rare. They cooked it perfectly. The filet was very tender and easy to slice. The sauce was on the creamy side but had a nice flavor to go with it. I also had the coconut shrimp. A crisp outer layer and a refreshing slaw & sauce to go with it. I had the pineapple creme brulee for dessert. Delicious! They served it inside a pineapple slice. There was pineapple chunks on the bottom and creme brulee on top of it. I will come back for more."}
{"text":"You can NEVER go wrong with Tommy Bahama's restaurant.  Save room for the coconut cake!"}
{"text":"If pricey, beachy resort wear & assorted barware/gifts is your thing, you're gonna love this store. The island theme carries throughout the restaurant as well. They have a nice selection of women's/men's clothing and some unique gift items (Tommy Bahama logo stuff, beer glasses, flasks, etc) You can also find candles, lotion, scents, etc. 

There always seems to be some promo going on too. I purchased a $20 gift card for $5 for a charity promo and received a postcard from the store in the mail reminding me to use the gift card! Nice touch.  I also receive discount cards in the mail a few times a year for retail purchases. 
My fave thing about the store is the yummy pina colada mini cakes & iced tea you can enjoy while shopping!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Tommy Bahama a few times over the last couple of years and always enjoy it. My family and I decided to spend my birthday dinner there last minute and our service got off to a rough start with our initial server, perhaps she was having an off night..we all have them, but things weren't going so well and my father in-law ended up requesting another server as we had yet to have our orders taken or much else. The manager stepped in and was extremely accommodating (I didn't catch her name) and sent Adam to be our server for the evening. Adam was WONDERFUL and he really turned the experience around for us. I appreciated him taking on our group, especially knowing that we were a bit upset, and he treated us so kindly and was very attentive. We have dined here before and will definitely continue to in the future...requesting Adam, of course! He helped to make our evening special along with the management and that meant a lot to us. Of course, we enjoyed our food and being together, but Adam's service was really the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour yesterday and what a happy hour it was :P We were greeted by Xavier (Javier?) who immediately sat us at a nice table on the patio. Happy hour is only available on the patio or at the bar. It was a little chilly so we asked for a heater which he said was no problem. 

Joni was our server and quickly arrived to take our drink orders. There are several HH drinks available, everything from beer, wine and cocktails. We chose the sangria and coconut cloud martini. The coconut cloud was SOOO GOOD. Ron Matusalem Platino, Vanilla Stoli, Coconut rum, cream of coconut and toasted coconut on top. I could have drank about 6 of these! 

We perused the HH small plates and decided on the following:

Coconut shrimp- 4/5. 3 large shrimp covered in coconut. For $8 was hoping for at least 4.
Blackened fish tacos- 4/5. 2 tacos with cabbage and lime sour cream. Very good. 
Roasted pork quesadilla 4/5. About 6 pieces (1/2 a regular one?) loaded with delicious pork and cheese. 
Macadamia crusted goat cheese- 5/5. This was really good, loved the flavor combinations. Ended up ordering a second one. 
Ahi Poke napoleon- 5/5. Fresh Ahi tuna on avocado, delicious. Again we ordered a second one it was so good. 

Ended with the pina colada cake- 3/5. Didn't live up to its description. Lacked any Myers Rum flavor. All the food came out fast and our service throughout was pretty good. The first heater only lasted 5 minutes. The couple next to us asked for another one which they brought out. That one lasted about another 5 minutes as well. No one ever came to try and fix it or try a third one. 

Overall really happy with the happy hour and would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"I had really good service when I went to Tommy Bahama for dinner.  My friend works in their marketing dept, so I figured she had said something to our waitress.  However, when the check came and our friend's discount wasn't on there, we found out that they had never spoken about us.  The waitress was just really good to everyone!  

We enjoyed our dinner; I had the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken ($29), and it was very juicy and flavorful.  I do think the prices are a bit high, unless you go for happy hour and enjoy the yummy small plates.  I could eat one of the $5 plates for a meal, though hubby might need two to fill him up."}
{"text":"Great representation of Key West cuisine - makes for quite a lovely brunch with the family."}
{"text":"We went to the bar to get out of the heat. The environment was clean and very tropical. The Bartender was attentive with a chill attitude. 

We decided to get drinks and a bite to eat:

Mai Tai: sweet and strong and full of pineapple. Perfect for cooling off in the Vegas heat.

Dark and Stormy: Made with Gosling's Black Seal Rum and Ginger Root Beer. It was strong, tart and refreshing. It's considered \"Bermuda's National Drink\". I had two.

Key Lime Pie: Delicious and silky with the slight sweetness and tart of key lime. The crust was a moist and crumbly graham cracker crust. 

We'll be back for the lobster tacos."}
{"text":"Well THAT was disappointing. Terrible cut of meat, my husband had the rib eye, mediocre fish tacos, poorly made Coconut Cloud Martini, which used to be my favorite cocktail, and horrid service. I have watched Tommy Bahama change over the years, moving farther away from the original vision, and this was a total let down."}
