{"text":"Great resto for authentic afghan food. Nice mixture of flavours and spices. The rice dishes and grilled meats were delectable. My fave has to be the eggplant! Afghan tea is a must to finish off the meal. Byow too."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and the experience was excellent. Subtle spicy touches that let the flavours explode in mouth. The ravioli as entree was perfect. The soup was also delicate and extremly tasty. Recommend chiken kabob chose the leg instead as it is juicy and tender in mouth. The waiter was very friendly and offered good suggestions. I highly recommend this place and hope they will sustain the quality over time."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner at Sur Kaboul. Great service and very accommodating to young children. Many healthy choices on the menu. Loved the Borani & the Tarkari Chalow."}
{"text":"Super bon resto ! Prix raisonnables et nourriture délicieuse ! Ambiance chaleureuse et super bon service !"}
{"text":"Very good food,good location, and nice ambiance,  the service is also professional. I love their Ashak and qabuli palow. It's byow! Reserve your table for weekends because it gets busy"}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente . Très belle découverte ! La soupe perse est succulente . C'est un amenez votre vin ! J'enlève un étoile car vaut mieux réserver les fins de semaines. De plus , étant donné que tu emmènes ton vin ça parle fort !"}
{"text":"Great Place to taste afghan cuisine. I highly recommend their lambs"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem quite by chance while walking around with a friend. We were uninspired when we stopped to look at the menu so we entered without any huge expectations. But we were very pleasantly surprised. Everything was just right: the staff, the interior, the overall ambiance... But the food...it was just amazing. The spices, the flavors, were nothing like anything I've ever tasted and I loved that."}
{"text":"Great food and attentive, yet not disturbing service. Oh, and it's BYOW, which you should do do :)"}
{"text":"Je n'avais aucune attente face à ce restaurant Afghan. Personne de mon entourage ne l'avait essayé, il n'y avait pas vraiment d'avis partagé au moment où j'y suis allée en 2014 et c'était ma première expérience afghane. Nous sommes arrivées et le restaurant était vide. C'est sûr que c'est questionnant, mais on ne savait pas ce qui suivrait! Le service était très attentionné, nous avons choisi un menu 4 services pour essayer le plus de plats possibles. La soupe était savoureuse et l'entrée fantastique. Les mélanges de saveurs m'ont vraiment étonnée. Quand le plat principal est arrivé, j'étais déjà pleine! Je l'ai finalement rapporté. Le restaurant s'est rempli au fur et à mesure de la soirée, mais je crois qu'il est encore peu connu. Pour ma part, je n'hésite pas à le recommander! Un des serveurs nous a raconté l'histoire derrière l'ouverture du restaurant (familial) et en a profité pour nous partager quelques souvenirs d'enfance qu'il avait dans son pays. Allez à ce restaurant, si comme moi vous n'avez pas l'intention de visiter l'Afghanistan de si près, vous aurez au moins l'occasion d'y goûter et de vivre une très belle soirée."}
{"text":"As someone who loves to explore new flavours, this Afghani restaurant was a great experience. First, the food. Presentation was nice, taste was amazing. It's one of those restaurants where you really feel that the chef cooks has a purpose and a love for what she is doing. So heartwarming.   Our entrees where Samosa and some Afgan Ravioli. To die for. The main dishes where a plate of different meat. Chicken, veal and beef. I didn't care that much for the beef but the veal and chicken were tender and well seasoned, exactly what you would expect from that kind of restaurant.   As for the staff, our waiter gave us an excellent service. Worthy of a 4 star restaurant. Koodos!  BTW, I went on a week day, but I heard that, in the weekend, it's better to call and reserve."}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas si nous sommes tombés sans le savoir sur une mauvaise soirée, mais le service était vraiment très long. Nous avons mis une demi-heure avant de pouvoir commander, et j'ai eu mon entrée une heure après être entrée dans le restaurant... A la limite, si on avait eu quelques snacks à grignoter en attendant, l'attente aurait été supportable, mais même pas. Au final, après 2h15 assis à table, alors que j'attendais pour un dessert, j'ai fini par demander l'addition et un dessert à emporter. Résultat : arrivée à la maison, j'ai ouvert la boîte, et ils m'avaient donné le mauvais dessert !   C'est franchement dommage, car au-delà de ça, la nourriture est bonne et les plats variés. J'étais ravie de pouvoir tester la cuisine afghane, mais pas le service..."}
{"text":"Great place, chill, friendly staff.  The food is AMAZING.  Totally new and unconventional.    Like any authentic resto, be prepared to wait - but it is SO worth it."}
{"text":"This is a pretty new restaurant with some amazing dishes and a great family behind it. The eggplant appetizer Borani Badenjan is amazing, as is the lamb 'jarret' Qubuli Palow. I predict this restaurant will only get better as they learn to handle the dinner rush and speed up service."}
{"text":"Super resto afghan, traditionnel, même le serveur est afghan! Bouffe extraordinaire, vraiment goûteuse, excellente Les plats sont typiques et le serveur vous les expliquera  C'est un apportez votre vin, ce qui est cool! Nous avions apporté des bières pour l'entrée/apéro, et du vin pour la suite Le décor est très stylé aussi, et le service très bon Bonne ambiance, bonne soirée Allez-y!"}
{"text":"I've now been here twice for dinner, and loved it both times. The second time, I brought an out of town guest, who also loved it. The food is good and I've had great service both times. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to several Afghan restaurants all over USA and Canada and have never been to one that serves such a big variety of authentic dishes! I would recommend the quruti as an appetizer. The kabobs were very tender and tasteful and the qabuli palow was amazing. The service was great and the staff were friendly and welcoming. I will definitely return soon :)"}
{"text":"On a frenzied Friday night, we were a group of 4 desperate to find a restaurant that was firstly open and secondly willing to seat us without reservations. The hunt took longer than we hoped and the impending winter storm, rapidly dropping temperatures and our grumbling stomachs were making us desperate for a hearty meal. Then Kaboul did come to our rescue as the lineup outside Ma Poule Mouillee was more than atrocious that night, and we were grateful.   Not so grateful were we to be seated at a very cramped corner of the restaurant when there were plenty of other tables and a whole other empty room on the other side. Now, I understand that it's easier for the staff to clean up if the mess is constrained to one area but I knew we were going to get ignored the whole night. And sadly we were ignored as our waiter came 30 mins later than usual to take our order and then after our appetizers did come out, he forgot to bring the bread that went with them. That was all after maybe an hour wait for our food (which again I can blame on the dinner rush) but all this simply added to our exasperation that night.   The mighty saving grace: my Quboli Pulow - the rice and lamb shank dish! I wasn't too impressed with the appetizers - I had had high hopes for my favourite Persian dish, the eggplant dip dish but I bit into many pieces of raw garlic when tasting it sans the bread that never came. But, that quboli pulow - with the tender meat and fragrant, flavourful rice - earned major redeeming points for this place. I like supporting restaurants that are under the radar but have good food so yeah, I would recommend this place!   PS: the other dishes we had ordered were the meat dumpling - okay - and the chapali kebab and the chicken kebab - both good - maybe a bit pricey but not too bad."}
{"text":"For what it is, the price, the food, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm certainly not an Afghan expert, but I've returned and I will again. BYOW"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday dinner in December. It's a small restaurant, beautifully decorated on the pricey side. The host was very polite and explained the menu several times. We had the 5 course meal which I ended up sharing with someone because it was too much for one person to finish. The food was great. The soup was warm and hearty, so many flavours that I wasn't used to but it was delicious. The two main meals were just as good. I've had mantoo at other restaurants but really enjoyed it here. I didn't like the lentils over the dumplings so ate it alone. Green tea and dessert were included. The tea just helped down just a heavy meal, you could have about 2 small cups. Finding parking was the biggest headache in that area."}
{"text":"The second visit was even better than the first. On the weekends the place gets packed so the service  can back up a bit. All the plates were just excellent and they have added some nice desserts including homemade ice cream and a very competitive baklava. The staff are as nice and as friendly as ever and you will most likely have a Memorable  meal."}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers & kebabs. This place is a hidden gem in plateau. It's a must visit if you like good afghani food.  Highly recommend the eggplant appetizer, minced meat stuffed ravioli, the veal main course & beef kebabs."}
{"text":"Excellent chef and services. I highly recommend to anyone in the area in need of catering and orders for delivery! Hakim makes the best food and listens to all your needs, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally a fine dining afghan restaurant. Everything was perfect, the food had so much flavor and was cooked to perfection. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious. Fresh ingredients, BYOW, handmade and extremely flavorful. This place is a must try! I walked in on a Thursday evening and wasn't expecting much since there was barely anyone in the restaurant however I very quickly changed my mind when I received the plate of their fresh bread with dipping sauces. Amazing! I was also advised by the waited that some items on the menu were not available seeing as how the woman who makes the Asha (by hand... every day) called in sick. WOW! You had me handmade...  Every single bite was better than the last! I look forward to the next time I go back! Give this place a try and let me know what you think ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. It was my second time at this restaurant and a first for my partner. We wanted a special celebratory meal and we definitely got it. The food was absolutely delicious. We had Ashak, Manto and the Qubuli Palow which was one of the best lamb dishes I've had in my life -  tender and full of flavours. The service was also excellent with a pleasant and patient waiter who was happy to explain and recommend us what to order.  Oh, we ended up with a lovely light desert, rice pudding with rose water and pistachio. No doubt it's a 5 star place. For sure we will go there again next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very nice food and very attentive service. Four of us had lamb, vegetable, chicken, and beef patties. All were happy with their food. We tried the Afghan teas as well, which were flavorful and a welcome warm up before heading out into a cold night. But the highlight was the house specialty ice cream, with cardamom, pistachios, and other secret ingredients."}
{"text":"While the food was heavenly, the service was below average. The restaurant was not busy the evening we visited. Still, it took a long time for our food to arrive. I also had to go find the server in the back to request the bill. Its a shame. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this amazing place! The food was phenomenal and service was great. We got the chabli kabob and the tarkari chalow both of which were great but the kabob was the winner for sure. We also got the baklava and the jalebi for dessert and enjoyed them both. Only thing though is to come early or make a reservation because it gets busy quickly!"}
{"text":"J'accorde d'abord les 4 étoiles pour le service. Impeccable! Wahab, notre serveur, s'est occupé de nous du début à la fin. Il connaît le menu et n'hésite pas  nous conseiller. La nourriture? À mi chemin entre la cuisine iranienne et la cuisine indienne, la cuisine afghane fait place aux grillades et à l'eau de rose (Perse) et aux épices tels le curcuma, la cardamome, sans compter le basmati, présent dans tous les plats (Inde). Si vous vous attendez à de généreuses sauce avec le jarret d'agneau ou la brochette come accompagnement, vous serez déçus. Mais les saveurs rachètent le tout. Sans compter la fraîcheur des aliments. À la fin du repas, on nous propose de prendre le dessert (avec un des thés proposés, dont le marocain, ou un  café de votre choix) au salon de thé. Bonne idée! Et belle attention. Le décor est sobre et rappelle les origines de l'endroit mais pas surchargé de babioles exotiques bon marché. Je retournerai certainement jeter un coup d'il à travers cette fenêtre sur Kaboul."}
{"text":"I had their ashak - vegetarian - leak and coriander filled ravioli topped with yogurt and lentil sauce. It was good and different for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Good authentic Afghan food. Service was a bit slow cuz there was only on server serving 6 or 7 tables!"}
{"text":"it was delicious, all there dish are really well presented and looks authentic. I went with 2 of my middle eastern friends and they though it was good. It's not the kinda place where you say i can't wait to go back but it was a great experiance."}
{"text":"I have had this on my list of places to try for the longest time, and I'm so happy I finally came! The family that owns the restaurant was so nice, and the food was amazing.   There aren't many vegetarian main course options on the menu, so I opted to just eat a bunch of appetizers so I could try a bit of everything.  They were very accommodating and replaced the meat sauce on the Ashak with a lentil sauce to make it vegetarian. The Ashak was nice and light, and the Ash Reshteh soup was super soothing. The Qurooti was also really tasty but after the first few bites, it got to be way too salty, which is probably why it's meant to be shared as an appetizer and not as a main. My favorite part of the meal, though, was probably the free bread. It came with tangy dipping sauces, and had the most divine texture to it.  All in all, beautiful décor, great service, authentic food, and BYOW - what's not to like?"}
