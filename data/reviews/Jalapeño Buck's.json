{"text":"The BEST Brisket Sandwich I have ever had.... Lived in KC and this beats them all......."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried the pulled pork, brisket and the green chili burrito. Everything was wonderful! This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome... Beans are really good. Pulled pork is ah-mazing. It's a nice little authentic place nestled in the orange groves."}
{"text":"No indoor seating but there was shade, misters, and an outdoor AC unit. The food was not bad but who doesn't have any type of chicken on a BBQ menu? The owner came out and asked how things was and we asked why he didn't have chicken and be straight up said he never would. You'd think he'd be more open to listening to his customers about what they want...after all, it's the customers who keep him in business. There was a lot of fat on the meat and the burritos were filled with \"mush\" rather than shredded beef. The mango salsa was good and the bean quesadilla was good too."}
{"text":"We've had pulled pork sandwiches, ribs and burritos. They were all fantastic though the ribs especially stood out (not in an emaciated way, I just mean they were really good). The service is fantastic, and we've always left happy and full. You should probably try it."}
{"text":"Coming from K.C. I'm use to good BBQ and Buck's doesn't disappoint!  The burros are great but the beef brisket sandwich is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"The green chili beef burrito is like, cornstarch beef flavored jelly in a tortilla. I never seen anything like it."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food,  Great bbq and if you remember the old El charro, this is it and then some. Awesome  Mexican food.  Great people serving great food . Highly recommend. .."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had in AZ in my 6 years living here! Burnt ends and brisket were both AMAZING! I used to love Joe's BBQ but now that I've eaten here Joe's can't even compete. Green chili beef was also on point! Definitely recommend this place and will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited Jalapeño Bucks for the third time and decided to add my praise to a wonderful BBQ stand.  I have tasted their burritos which are pretty good.  Their pulled pork sandwiches are even better. However, my favorite is the brisket sandwich. Their BBQ sandwiches come in 1/4 lb and 1/2 lbs versions and I had the 1/2 lb tonight.  Amazing.  I have had the 1/4 lb sandwich before but the half pound is really loaded with very tender smoky meat. The BBQ mud sauce is my favorite on the brisket.  Probably a lot of calories so I won't have the 1/2 pound version very often.   If you love BBQ, give this place a try. We brought some out of town family here tonight for a special meal at a very casual place. They loved it.    Jalapeño Bucks has some very good homemade salsa's as well.  Our favorite is the mango salsa. A half pint was perfect for our group."}
{"text":"The BBQ at this place is amazing! They have a variety of meats and sauces to choose from as well as Mexican food options. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. Be aware, it is outdoors (picnic tables and misters to keep cool) and there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! The best BBQ in Arizona and for the best price! Got the burnt ends, they were so good, great smokey flavor and good tenderness. They have great homemade BBQ sauce all different flavors but it doesn't even need it. We also got the pulled pork sandwich and that was really good. The only negative thing would be when you buy their homemade chips salsa doesn't come with so you have to buy the salsa as well. But overall great place!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Pulled pork sandwich heaven. My only advice is to join Uber eats so I can eat it in my jammies."}
{"text":"4 of us ate fantastic BBQ for $40 in the middle of an orange grove. People are friendly,  service with a smile. Owner was grateful.  Hard to find an issue. We loved it."}
{"text":"Tried Jalapeño Buck's for lunch and we weren't overly pleased about this place after we ate our meal. I had the BBQ pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw, both were very good and tasty. Their choices of bbq sauces were tasty but very watery. Husband had the ground pork burrito and he was not pleased at all with his meal. He likened the flavor of his burrito to elementary school meat in a tortilla. Hardly any flavor. The place was cute and rustic with only outside eating. The prices seem high for the amount of meal you get. $2.50 for a little cup of slaw on the side. $6 each for the sandwich and the burrito. It was okay food but not worth going back again."}
{"text":"One of the valleys best kept secret! Among food and even better prices. Seating is outside but totally tolerable with misters and portable ACs. Mango salsa is a must have!"}
{"text":"Yummy chips and salsa (mango salsa is my fave)!!! Delicious green sauce shredded beef burritos  They also have amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The food is so good & everyone that works there was so nice! Only wish I could order smaller portions of the salsa so I could try them all. But seriously amazing food people!!"}
{"text":"My mouth is soooo happy! Pulled pork best ive had. Quaint, adorable place. Burrito excellent. Long line to order but food came fast."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual place after rafting and this was perfect. The brisket sandwich was tender and really good. The mango salsa was also a favorite. We also tried the pork sandwich and coleslaw - very good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!!! One of the best Green Chili Shredded Beef Burritos in town!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  Been here 4 times the past few months or so, and every time the lunch line just keeps getting longer and longer.  And for a good reason.  I almost hate to give it a good review, in fear that more people will visit this place - making my wait even longer.  But it's cool - Buck deserves it for the amazing burritos and coleslaw-topped pork sandwiches.  Even my borderline-vegetarian wife loves the meat here.  Oh, and props on the \"small\" bag of chips - great bargain, even tho the salsa costs extra (WTF?) Overall though, the easiest 5 star I've rated!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. A friend did their promo video and recommended it to me.   Price was okay for quantity but quality was seriously lacking. I got \"everyone's favorite\" green chile beef burrito. Flavor was okay but the beef/chile was like pure aide gravy inside a tortilla. You couldn't even identify what was inside. Not good a start.  I can understand and appreciate creativity but if you're going to mashup two culinary concepts (BBQ & Mexican) into one it needs to be exceptional, not mediocre.   I don't know if it's a Mormon cultural thing due to too much jello and casseroles, but poor choice in local cuisine is not uncommon in Mesa. And based on the high reviews here, most of the reviews have to be coming from the same people that have had their palates desensitized by Pete's and El Charro their entire lives."}
{"text":"This is great little spot to get a breakfast or red chili pork burrito and a pulled pork sand which! The ribs are a little overrated though - just a heads up."}
{"text":"Really good mix of Mexican and BBQ. I got the Red Chilli Shredded pork burrito and it was really good!  They have delicious sauces as well.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try this place we keep seeing as we live nearby. Was pleasantly surprised to find the best brisket in the valley!! I'm not kidding you; we are meat eaters in this family and this place definitely hit the mark! On top of it, they have some great original sauces ! My favorite is the Spicy Barbeque or \"Barbeque with a Kick\", as she called it and my husbands favorite is the mango salsa. Great customer service . We've always been greeted with a smile and had wonderful conversation with the owners. The hours are a little disappointing but on our visit this week we informed they are training employees so they can expand their hours! This place rocks!! My husband says he pulled pork is the best, I say the brisket is; either way, you can't lose!"}
{"text":"We were out looking at model homes and wondered why there were so many cars in this parking lot. Now we know why, the BBQ was amazing! The seating is all outdoors and tucked away in an orange grove. I had the ribs and my wife had the 1/4 lb pulled pork and the servings were large! We also tried their homemade salsa and chips and they were fantastic. We highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"We love this place. The Beef Brisket is melt in your mouth good. No need for any sauce but, if you want sauce, all the options are good. All the burritos are good. We buy chips and salsa here at least once a week. We usually get take out but have eaten here as well."}
{"text":"Listen yelp friends, I've been to the proverbial Kansas City BBQ mountain top many times. Plates of ribs have been  handed to me at Jack Stack and Arthur Bryant's- and I did indulge. In fact, I didn't think anyone could smoke ribs on par with our mid west friends...until I went to Jalapeno Bucks. You see, it takes a LOT of time and very low heat in order to penetrate ribs in a way that leaves a deep smoke layer with a beautiful \"bark\" on the outside. This bark is what defines a very good meat smoking process- you know you did it right when the meat is fall-off-the-bone moist and delicate, but is contained by a smokey, mildly crunchy, almost pie-crust exterior, dusted with a hint of house sauce. Too much sauce and the house is covering something up. Too little sauce and you're not experiencing enough of the house ingenuity. Well, Jalapeno Bucks DOES IT RIGHT. Their ribs are exceptionally well done- first rate. They are less barky than a KC joint, but more smokey. They have struck a perfect balance between delicate, and punch-you-in-the-face. Dip them into the house's sauce and MAN, you got yourself a great plate of ribs! The only downside is they only make them for Saturday consumption, and they sell out fast. So, order them specially or come early."}
{"text":"We love eating here. Macaroni salad is incredible!! Just about everything is good and they are super nice."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a line, but there is a line for a reason! The food is delicious and the service is just as great. We love this neighborhood spot, it is very unique with a lot of charm. Very fun non-chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good place to visit if you don't mind watery beans in your burritos. The only saving grace was their mango salsa. I'll go back to try their BBQ next time but the burritos sucked IMO.."}
{"text":"Amazing green chili burrito and quesadilla! My parents and I happened to stumble upon this place as we were meeting at mid pot in between our house. I pulled in not knowing this has been here for years. We had to try it as many people were taking Togo orders. We decided to dine in and it was one of the best random places we have ever stumbled upon! Keep in mind their business hours as they close early and closed on Sunday and Monday. I hope to go back with in the next few weeks with some girlfriends and try their BBQ.   Great customer service and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place: they have the best barbecue in ARizona. Must go for ribs on Saturday"}
{"text":"This is a great take out restaurant the brisket sandwich is my favorite with three different barbecue sauces to choose from it truly satisfies everyone's taste buds"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The pulled pork sandwich- The absolute BEST I've ever had. The macaroni salad-a sweet and creamy delight! The beef green chile quesadilla-AMAZING! I can't wait to go back and try all of their menu offerings!!!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket sandwich was perfect! I'm not a huge fan off coleslaw normally but it was a perfect addition to the sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. The pulled pork is cooked just right.  The ambiance is old Arizona"}
{"text":"I liked the brisket.  The green chile burrito was a bit too runny for my liking, but overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"Put simply: This restaurant has arguably the best brisket I've ever eaten. The meat was tender and loaded with flavor. No sauce required! I will definitely be coming back here more often."}
{"text":"I am also among those reviewers who wonder what the hype is. It's a cool location by the orange groves, but the food is just not really that good. My wife has been there a couple of times and has tried a couple of their different burritos. The bean burrito she got tasted like something you could make at home for less than $1. In fact making one at home would have been better because the cheese wasn't even melted. I finally tried the place out since we recently moved nearby. I got the pulled pork sandwich since so many reviewers mention it being the best they've ever had. I thought the pork's texture was way off. It was a combo of being soggy with some strands that were kind of tough and the flavor was just okay. I feel like I make better pulled pork on my smoker at home and I am by no means a professional with my BBQ. Parking is crazy and there is always a huge line and I just can't really piece everything together."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place you must not have taste buds. Best brisket I've had EVER. We came with a very large group for lunch and they had our food was out within 10 minutes. It's picnic seating so if you're not cool with that then don't go."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Bucks is amazing. Tucked away where I would have never found it myself, but my boss turned the entire office on to them and we frequently eat there for our Fun Friday office lunch days."}
{"text":"This place is the best ever and always remember to call ahead and place your order because they are always busy because they're so good will definitely recommend tonanybody!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I tried this place!!! I came from California for the weekend and my friends took me here! Their beef briskets are out of this world and their bread tastes amazing!!!!! Highly recommend this place! You won't regret it! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast and friendly, too. This is some of the best BBQ around. Go try it for yourself; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. You can tell they take pride in their barbeque. Walk up ordering was quick and when the food came out it was a big portion. Two big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby brought home some bbq last week, and it was amazing. Beef brisket, macaroni salad, and I love that they have rice as well... very very good!"}
{"text":"They have the best brisket and pulled pork.  Brisket sandwich with coleslaw on top is the best. You can sit outside and watch the hummingbirds while you eat."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. It's a little rustic outdoor place tucked away from the road in the middle of an orange orchard. Had the brisket sandwich (the quarter pound option) with cole slaw on top. The meat was tender and tasty, and the bread was exceptional. The sandwich could've been complimented with a stack of pickles and/or raw onions on the side. Ordered a side of beans and found out only when I received my order that they were refried instead of whole. Overall a nice dinner and I will be back to try their pulled pork."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona but they need a restroom. They don't even make exceptions for toddlers who can't hold it and there's nowhere around. It's a far drive so my kiddos have to go EVERY TIME. Plus it's uncomfortable to eat when you need to use the restroom AND nowhere to wash your hands after eating BBQ. Wish they would get a port a potty at the very least. Every time I'm there I hear customers asking for the restroom so not sure why there still isn't any. Otherwise would be hands down best food in AZ."}
{"text":"Super good BBQ!!!!  We tried the pulled pork sandwiches and they were soooo good!!   I love how they leave the BBQ sauce out of the sandwich and let you pick ones on the table yourself. This way you get to actually taste the amazing smoked meat instead of having it drenched in sauce, and then pick the sauce that you actually want. I tried all 4 sauces and then opted to eat it without sauce because the meat tasted that good.  The Mexican good options that other people ordered around us looked amazing as well.  Minus a star because they don't have public restrooms. We had to drive to the park nearby just to use a restroom afterwards."}
{"text":"Good bar b que and amazing red beef burrito.  Drove past it at first, but glad we turned around. Pricing is fair. Green spicy salsa is a little creamy and delicious. Definitely going back asap!"}
{"text":"Had a red chili burrito w/cheese and large sprite,great value for just over 8 bucks. It was really good.(don't try to eat it with a white dress shirt on) I'll try green chili in the near future. Will also try the bbq soon ,I smoke all my own meats so I'm very particular, to be honest I haven't found a BBQ joint in the valley worth my money let alone the drive there ,but I will give it a try soon and let you know."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. I had the beef brisket and hands down was the best beef brisket sandwich I have ever had...will get it many more times in the near future."}
{"text":"Well I hate to be a pisser on all the great reviews of this place, but I have to give my honest opinion of the food I had.  Service and cute atmosphere was fine.  The Brisket on my sandwich was thin, greasy and I think was smoked with liquid smoke, really not very good.  Sorry I lived in Central Texas and still have family there so I know what real bbq brisket should taste like.  This isn't it.  The Mac salad was way too sweet in my opinion. The Red Chile I had was mediocre at best.  These people are sitting on an absolute gold mine with the citrus business and the bbq joint.  Glad for them that Mesa Mormans who don't what good bbq is and snowbirds will support them.  Just not for me.  Again, just my opinion, don't want to make anyone mad."}
{"text":"I had the briscuit, and it was amazing. Dwayne served us and gave us TOP notch service!!! Comin here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best burrito I ever Ate I swear to god. The older woman inside was a little disgruntled but I probably would be too if I were in that hot box"}
{"text":"Good eatin! Everything is good except the coleslaw!gotta try the burritos! Best brisket ever! Puttin az barbeque on the spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today and found it very appealing. Very busy as well which does say a lot about it. I had the green chili pork burrito. It was on the good side of bland, not much if any green chili with no spice/ heat at all. I am going to try something different next week and expect to add another star or two!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good!! I've ordered the pulled pork for my family before and it was pretty good. The ground pork and green chili burrito is by far my favorite. I could eat one every other day. Salsa is tasty with just enough spice. I can't stop eating the chips once I start. Great place, I got every so often and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Food is great!  They have a Sasparilla for a beverage choice.  Burritos are very wet, but yummy.  Brisket is exceptional.  Looking forward to trying the pulled pork.  Prepare to eat outside.  I prefer to take it home."}
{"text":"Wow! Super good BBQ, better than Rudys or Joes in my opinion plus its super close to my home. Staff was friendly and food came out quick. Outside seating only."}
{"text":"I had a rack of Ribs. Melissa had Brisket and Macaroni salad. My Ribs were outstanding. Good char, very moist, very tender. Basically a big rack of Ribs double wrapped in foil. Too hot too handle at first. Their sauce is vinegar based, which I usually think is gross, but it was pretty tasty. Melissa said the Brisket was very good. I can't say because she didn't let me have any. The macaroni salad looked like it had slaw mixed in, but she didn't offer me a bite, so it must have been good. Nice outdoor picnic tables surrounded by citrus tree orchard. Lots of hummingbirds.  Definitely going back to try their burritos, and everything else. Good find."}
{"text":"NO RESTROOM, I wish that the owner, who I did talk to, has to endure going to places where they have NO RESTROOM. I spent 40.00 for food to find this out. They don't have to worry about me coming back by their special place!"}
{"text":"After passing Jalapeño Bucks many times and noticing it is constantly busy, A couple of weeks ago I decided to give it a try. Sooo glad I did.  Although, the line to order is a wait, the food is ready quickly (even with large orders).  The atmosphere is different as it is a shipping crate in the middle of an orange grove with patio seating. What makes it fun is all the different signs. Service is friendly and upbeat.   Our order consisted of green chili burrito, pulled pork sandwiches, quesadillas, bean burrito, and side of beans. The portions are large and well made. After one bit of the green chili burrito, I went back to order one to take home to a family member who couldn't join us for lunch. Everyone was very pleased with their orders.   Have already been back."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their Gringo Green salsa, which they sell by the pint and the quart.  So delicious!  Their burritos are, as other reviewers have mentioned, a bit on the liquidy side.  My first time here, I had a green ground pork burrito, and it was delicious.  The second time I got a red shredded pork, and wasn't a huge fan.  I haven't had their BBQ yet but it's next on my list.  Friends and the husband have had it and said it is really good.  This place is always packed despite its out-of-the-way location and that it's only been around less than a year...which tells you something!  They also have a lot of regulars, so I'm not the only one who keeps coming back.  I believe they are closed Mondays, FYI."}
{"text":"I hate to burst the bubble of 4-5 reviews, but I wasn't impressed. We ordered a red chili burrito and a pork sandwich. Plus chips and salsa. The bill was 30.00. The mac salad was good and burrito was good. The pork sandwich was ok, maybe better with the slaw $$. The chips is where it pissed me off! 1/2 bag of chips plus salsa was 10.00 bucks! Never even got to try the specialty salsas! I don't know how others get these salsas and meals, but too pricey for me to find out. Never again"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the no dog policy is a bummer especially since it is an outdoor only restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness a hidden little gem it is! In the Grove's off Val Vista and the 202 Red Mountain freeway. They don't advertise, it's a place you know by word of mouth. But once you go there you will return! Everything I've had here is excellent. It is outdoor seating only, they have mister's that help some. But they are real good about wrapping up to go.  The pulled pork is smoking and tasty. You really don't need BBQ sauce, that would be an insult! They have an unusual combo of food, BBQ and burritos. The red chilli mix burrito is the bomb. Delish mixed with beans even better! I eat here about every 2 weeks or so and will grab a full rack of ribs on a Saturday night on my way home. Their chips and salsa are delish also. You got to try this place!"}
{"text":"The barbecue is very good. My wife had the 1/2 ribs. That size is a large size for one person. Probably 2 meals for most. I had the 1/4 pulled pork, it was very good as well.  Their regular sauce & the bbq mustard were are favorites, they have a spicy also. The macaroni salad was macaroni noodles with cole slaw dressing. If you like cole slaw, you will like it. Cool little place!  We were going to eat there, but it was too hot out, so we brought it home and ate it. No indoor seating, but still great when we got it home."}
{"text":"My friend Jeff Crandall told me about this place...wow oh wow my husband and I couldn't choose so we got BBQ chopped sandwich and green pork burrito with cheese..we truly couldn't decide which was better. Finally the weather has cooled off and it's perfect to eat outside."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich, I was presently surprised with my sandwich, lots of tender meat. The variety of sauces and salsas is great, all tasted amazing. Customer service was friendly and fast. Will comeback for sure."}
{"text":"I've been driving by these orange groves several times a week since the 202 opened to Val Vista, but only recently tried Jalapeno Bucks.  I have tried both the green chili beef burro and the red chili pork burro.  They are both great finds for those of us who believe that chilis of all colors are definitely a food group.  The only thing my husband wants when we go, is the green chili ground pork burro.  I haven't tried it yet, but everyone in our family who has, raved about it.  Our family is five-generation Arizona residents (4 in Mesa) and we are picky about our Mexican food - we appreciate home-style burros and don't eat at places that have trendy ingredients (the worst is pineapple salsa!).  We patronize local establishments that have good food and staff that are focused on the customer.  Jalapeno Buck's is definitely that type of restaurant.  We haven't tried the BBQ at Buck's, but who wants BBQ when there is great Mexican food on the menu?"}
{"text":"Really fun place that mixes Mexican and BBQ in a surprisingly delicious way! I had a red chile pork burrito. All outdoor seating with misters so it wasn't bad even in June. Make sure to note the closing time as they close relatively early. They also have a deal on ribs on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Wow, what I nice surprise. The brisket sandwich was awesome, and the Cole slaw too. I asked for lean cuts and they took care of my request. Bun toasted somewhat and very delicious. The sauces (3) were all good, but I did find a favorite. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The food is really good and it is so nice to sit out in the orange grove and have lunch. BUT they no longer have restrooms which is VERY inconvenient and unacceptable. Is that even legal? If it is it shouldn't be!!!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place but after trying several items off the menu, I'm just not really a fan. The brisket is dry (including the burnt ends, which should never be dry unless you're starting with bad meat) and the pulled pork was over cooked mush. Giving it 3 stars because the green chili burrito was good. Otherwise, the BBQ side of the menu either has some quality control issues or just isn't as good as the reviews say."}
{"text":"I am a smoked rib snob...,picky.  The ribs at Jalapeño Buck's are very good.  Pulled pork...very good.  Was impressed.  Too bad ribs are available only on Saturdays."}
{"text":"If your hungry try a bean and cheese quesadilla, or a green beef burro with cheese. You can't go wrong with either of those, there is also bbq."}
{"text":"Read the great reviews and wanted to check this place out. Absolutely best mango salsa around. Hubby buys it by the quart. Wonderful on grilled seafood! All salsas are pretty good too! The brisket, egg and cheese burrito is awesome. The sweet macaroni salad is yummy. Staff very, very friendly. Call ahead or you will be waiting in line. Worth the wait though!!!"}
{"text":"Love Jalepeno Bucks!! Their food is excellent. Pulled pork, salsa, chips, burritos,and sandwiches. My family loves the sweet green salsa and the smoked pork. Anytime we are having Mexican at home we crave Jalepeno Buck salsa. The service is great too. Family owned, fun casual atmosphere. I recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Some great BBQ, I had the pulled pork and it was amazing. You get a pretty decent amount of food for the price too."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the BBQ Brisket sandwich for lunch and it melted in your mouth..it was that good!  Cons--BBQ sauce was very thin, pricey since you only get the sandwich and no sides, they charge extra for chips!   Parking was tight, and no public bathrooms at a restaurant?? Not understanding how they get away with that.  Seating is outside on picnic tables and very limited."}
{"text":"Hubby said he had a surprise for me and brought me to this little walk up bbq/burrito place hidden away in an orange Grove. I had the best beef brisket sandwich I've ever had. Yummy can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw, burnt ends and a green chili burrito. The brisket was very tender and paired well with the soft bun. The coleslaw was very sweet and creamy (FYI -it does have onions in it for those who don't like onions).   The burnt ends were good but we preferred the brisket over the ends. However, it was late in the day and that might contribute to their dryness.   The green chili burrito (with cheese) is a unique combo of flavors. It's VERY liquidy and is hard to eat as a burrito. For me, the cheese overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. It was good but I don't think I'd order it again. The tortilla was freshly made and very tasty.   They have 4 sauces, all were good, some with more of a kick. Our favorite was the mud sauce which had a mustard flavor that we both enjoyed."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. It is always busy and that is the only negative thing. The red chili shredded pork burrito is more than enough and filling!."}
{"text":"As far as Phoenix bbq goes this place is very good. The brisket was as good as I've had outside of Austin. Good homemade tortilla chips and excellent bbq sauces and salsas."}
{"text":"Love that Jalepeno Bucks are my neighbors! A family owned company that is so inviting, friendly, and tasty.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and I love it all.  The BBQ is unique and smokey and the burritos are awesome - I get mine mixed green beef + bean and cheese.  Its all the awesomeness of a B+C burrito with spiciness of the green chili and the smoke of the beef.  Yum."}
{"text":"What a gem!  This is just a road side fast food place with the best brisket sandwich I have ever had!  The meat melted in my mouth!   It had a wonderful smoky flavor!   We sat at the picnic table outside but you can get your order to go!  Fast friendly service!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I think they have the best beef brisket sandwich I have ever enjoyed. The bun enhances the taste of the BBQ meat.  I have gone there many times and can't get myself to try anything else.  One of these days I'll try a burrito, but till then I'm loving the beef brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Pretty fun atmosphere.  Portions are big and the food is tasty.  Seating is a bit awkward, but the biggest issue was no bathroom.  If you have kids take the food to go.  In fact this is more of a to go restaurant in my opinion.  Mango salsa was excellent.  The other sides were good.  Medium bag of chips left us with leftovers and we were 7 in the party.  Burnt ends were good.  I like a little more char, but it was still very tasty."}
{"text":"My family and I had passed by the \"burritos and barbecue\" sign many times on our way home from work and were very intrigued to try it. Finally one Saturday, we made our way down to this cute little spot nestled into the orange groves. Initially, I wasn't as excited about the menu because I was more in the mood for chicken, but I went with the barbecue sandwich with coleslaw and all thoughts of chicken floated away. The selection of barbecue sauces was tremendously delightful and really made the sandwich. The cheese quesadillas were very cheesy and the salsa had a slightly spicy marinara sauce taste and was good too. Coke products served is also a plus and I enjoyed walking around the little store in the barn next door. We hope to return again soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful people, with a wonderful restaurant!!!! Get hooked!!!! I had the 1/2# brisket and it was amazing! Tried all their BBQ sauce and feel in love with the Buck Sauce..has a gentle heat to it."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich in the valley!!!  The buns are amazing and soft.  If you get chips the x-large is huge."}
{"text":"Goooood. Took my parents for first time. They really liked it too. Now the green Chile burritos are good, u can't beat my mamas tho, but these are next in comparison. The BBQ pulled pork was heavenly. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well I'm pretty dang happy with Jalapeño Bucks. This place is literally right around the corner from my brothers spot and I have been here twice in the last 3 days. I am from AZ and just moved back to North Carolina and this is some great BBQ Arizona style. I'm not typically a fan of BBQ style food but holy smokes his is really good   We ordered in the last 2 orders the red chili quesadilla, the red chili burrito combo with cheese, and the green chili beef quesadilla. Also got the Mac, the mango salsa, the biggest bag of chips for so cheap and this red sauce that is so moneyyyyyyyy!!!  We order the food get in the car from down the street it is literally ready in 4 minutes. The ladies at the register are super nice and friendly, good phone customer service and it's speedy. Overall I'm gonna get super fat from this place if I keep eating like this because it's freaking good. I will be back to try more, I promise you. Can't wait."}
{"text":"I just found bbq Nirvana! It's not Memphis, St Louis, Texan or even my beloved Kansas City. It's Arizona barbeque at Jalepeño Bucks found in an orange grove in Mesa, AZ.   They make the best brisket sandwich ever! It is juicy but tender like a short rib. Great deep smoke and the black pepper rub is perfect. Then it's placed on this buttery, squishy, big dinner roll (like) that has a very light amount of some aioli. Almost no fat on the meat but sooooo juicy. Joe's Barbeque, Brobeck's, Gates, The Wood Shed must come to the orange grove to see how sliced brisket is reinvented at Jalepeño Bucks!"}
{"text":"BBQ sauce is great however we did not love the Mexican food. My husband only eats chicken and my son and I have gluten allergies. Therefore there is nothing that any of us can eat here. I head that the ribs on Saturday are great but we have never had them. I think they need to work on their Mexican food."}
{"text":"Really good! I got the green chili project burrito. They didn't have any salsa to put on it but the spicy BBQ sauce on it wasn't bad. The only down side is that it is kind of pricy for being an outside shack. Really hot to sit out there and eat hot food. Hot good food."}
{"text":"Very cool little spot in the citrus orchards next to B & B Farms. Brisket, pulled pork and ribs I hear are very good. I had the red chili pork burrito combo and it was delicious.   Look forward to bringing friends and family by on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off, the Brisket sandwich I ordered was amazing! Like, really, really amazing. I drove over there from work to pick up lunch for myself and two co workers. They also were really impressed with their Brisket sandwich. I wish Yelp would allow stars for the different experiences because the food would get 5 stars hands down. My reason for giving the 2 star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" was because of the lady that gave me the order and asked what sauce I wanted. I politely asked if we could get three different sauces they offered for each sandwich since we had never eaten there and would like to try them. She was really rude about informing me that since i only ordered three sandwiches I could only have 2 sauces each.  REALLY? I just gave you $31 dollars for 1.5 lbs of brisket and 3 buns. You can't spare one more .5 oz cup of bbq sauce for each sandwich? Meanwhile, they have all the sauce you want on the tables for dine-in customers. Great food, not so friendly service.It's terrible how one employee can ruin something so good."}
{"text":"I just ate the best brisket sandwich ever. I'm a serious BBQ snob and finding this place in Phoenix I was skeptical. The brisket was perfect. Smoky and blackened on the ends and yet tender and juicy, seriously they give you sauce but I didn't want to ruin it. The bun was amazing and toasted with butter. I waited about ten minutes in line but it was worth it. The staff are super friendly and the venue is pretty cool. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Judging from the line of white shirts and SUV's you typically see at Cafe Rio and Mattas this place has definitely earned a following. The setting in the Orange grove was really nice and I kept hearing about their great brisket and burritos so I ordered a brisket sandwich and a red chile burrito. I can't think of a reason of why this place has such great reviews. My red chile burro had good flavor at first but about half way in I found a large portion of unmelted cheese that when I opened the burrito looked and tasted like it came from costco.  As for the brisket, it looked great when I opened it up. Nice smoke ring to the meat but unfortunately it just tasted like liquid smoke.  The lady at the register said I'd love the coleslaw on top for an additional dollar but I it didn't add to the sandwich at all and I love slaw on top of my BBQ normally. Its obvious that the people that think this is good brisket have never had BBQ outside of AZ. The place is a bit overpriced and if you didn't live in AZ you could probably justify paying their prices because it's still better Mexican fare than you find outside our state. But This is AZ! You can get a red chile burrito without the unmelted costco cheese for half the price and all of the flavor almost anywhere in town, or at least a side or two thrown in for your $8.50 1/4 pound sandwich. This joint does have one thing going for it though and it's their Mexican Red Hot sauce. It's awesome!  I won't be going back for any of the food but I'd definitely swing by for a pint of the sauce."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place when I have been living in Mesa for a whole year!?!  Today I was in the mood for steak or bbq and I thought I would just look for a new place on Yelp and hopefully I will find something good not too far from home coz I was so busy today. I checked out Yelp and to my surprise I found Jalapeño bucks literally 8 min away from me! Wow that's close and the reviews are great! So my husband and I decided to hop in our car and head there quickly to try it. We arrived and it's actually easy to miss especially when you're a regular customer of the orange farm, u think, it can't be here! But it is, right next to it!! How did I not pay attention before?!   We arrived, parked, ordered, got our food in about 10 min, maybe less! The place is like a shack with some tables outside. Very simple, very easy to order and u get ur food in what, 2 min? Yes!!  By the time my husband and I decided which table we wanted to sit on, my name was called!   We both ordered the same thing, the green shredded beef burrito. I only had rice in it coz I'm going dairy free at the moment and my husband had it with rice, cheese and sour cream. We also ordered a side of slaw (they offered us the bigger size instead of ordering two individual ones to save money) and 1 Crush. The total was $23! Not bad at all for something this fresh, this flavorful and this fast! On all the tables you'll find different sauces that you could add to ur food. I only tried the jalapeño bbq and it was fantastic with my burrito! The food was super hot and fresh and had a great kick to it, the slaw was the perfect cooling agent for the yummy fire in our mouths.   So glad I found this place. Definitely going back very soon! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited this place during my lunch break, I took the food to go as there is no inside dining area or bathrooms. Once I got into my Brisket sandwich I was very impressed. Amazing flavor, awesome bread. I would definitely recommend this place, only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it offers no bathrooms."}
{"text":"ARIZONA STYLE BBQ  Nice little spot! Definitely worth the drive! Great country feel and the staff are super polite! I would recommend the brisket sandwich or green chilli burrito."}
{"text":"Their salsa and bean and cheese quesadillas are fantastic. I would definitely recommend the bean quesadilla over the bean & cheese burrito. It's a fun casual place to take the kids, but they close early (I think 7pm).  Great service and the owners are really friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue.  Big portions For the price. Very friendly staff. Nice country atmosphere. I had the brisket sandwich with cold slaw on top. I am not a fan of cold slaw but this was not overpowering. My husband had the green Chile beef burrito. Very tasty but he said it would of tasted better if the the tortilla had been cooked a little. A little out of our way but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"You can probably tell by my check-in's and the fact that this place is bookmarked that it is one of my favorite eateries. If you are reading this review wondering if you should try jalapeño Bucks, I would suggest discontinue reading reviews and head there immediately. I myself am partial to the half pound beef brisket sandwich with coleslaw and shredded cheese. I want to try other things but I can't bring myself to do it because I just absolutely love that sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I've tried other stuff off of other peoples plates (people I know of course) but that sandwich, holy heck!!! Sauces are unconventional and quite delicious. Good luck in trying to refrain from over eating, an absolute favorite for everyone introduced to this place"}
{"text":"How did I not know this place existed?! It's a mix of BBQ and Mexican that is definitely done right. The menu is a perfect size with sandwich, burrito and quesadilla options. They serve sides of rice, beans (my favorite), mac or coleslaw salad. I'd recommend the green chili cheese burrito with added cheese. Be sure to check out the sauces on the tables and feel free to bring your own drink- theirs are $2. My old gripe is the limited parking; be there before 11am or it's a maze trying to find a spot. Keep in mind, it's outside seating only so I wouldn't venture there in the summer time. Sometimes the shaded awning just isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Good bbq - ribs were great, pulled pork was good.  Make sure to get the burnt ends. That was the highlight for sure"}
{"text":"Are you looking for something original, unique and amazing, then you have found it.  Went there for the first time today for lunch and will be heading back on my next available Saturday to have the ribs.  Had the green chili shredded beef burrito which was already described here as a soupy mess.  Spot on description and I agree it was very good.  Wife ordered the burnt ends thinking it was a sandwich but pretty much got a plate of the stuff which was fatty and melt in your mouth tender.   Surprisingly very good.  After I ate mine I helped her finish hers.  Outdoor seating only.  Staff very friendly.  Make sure you mention it is your first time and they might have a little something for you to try."}
{"text":"Love love love Duane and Diane Burdens hole-in-the-wall business idea that feeds friends and family from all over - I'm shocked how many people come from all over the valley just from raving reviews - no advertising.  I don't have a favorite dish either - everything is fabulous!   Haven't tried the PB& J brisket sandwich yet though - maybe I'll go there now and order it!   Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Jalapeño Bucks located in the parking lot my favorite orange grove B&B Citrus Farms. Bucks serves some of the finest BBQ I've ever encountered in Arizona. BBQ of this quality is generally found in Texas not in MESA. Had I not tasted it I wouldn't have believed it. Interesting how you discover such amazing culinary cuisine of this magnitude when you least expect it.  Obviously this pit master has been schooled in the finer art of flesh smoking. Bucks superior brisket skills  showcases his passion of an expert smoker. He's  truly taken time to discover the craft how one properly smokes the almighty brisket. Once you've mastered this meat then all else falls in line. I always measure a BBQ pit master by the quality of the brisket.    The Brisket sandwich is what I ordered not once but twice to savor the meat. The smoke ring around the brisket was impressive. The true birthmark of a brisket is the smoke ring itself just like ribs. The meat was moist and flavorful and broke apart with each bite. My side order of burnt ends if your a fan is worth grabbing. Very juicy meat nuggets explode with flavor morsels in your mouth as u masticate them. Grab some cold slaw, beans and a Dr Pepper for the finishing touches of your meal it will only lead to your personal pleasure.   BBQ so good it will create an addiction so bad you'll have to share with others to justify cravings. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I almost want to leave a bad review so that people stop coming here!  This is hands down our favorite place in the valley. The burnt ends are perfect every time. Quesadillas are out of this world tasty. Sauces are all amazing.  Generous with the chips. Service always friendly!  Don't be intimidated by the line, it moves pretty fast. We always call in now so that it's waiting for us."}
{"text":"I have to say I don't get the hype about this place. The ribs had almost no flavor if you didn't load them with BBQ sauce. I thought the green chili burrito was bland. And the burnt ends? What the heck? I don't see how these can even be called burnt ends, mine had no burnt or crust anywhere on them. It was just plain pieces of meat in a watery substance that could not even be called sauce.  If you really want to try good BBQ go to Joe's in Gilbert, it actually has flavor."}
{"text":"I tried this place last Friday after seeing a review somewhere..Great concept..It is in an a citrus orchard. I ordered the half pound Brisket sandwich to eat there and a Green Chili Burrito to go. As a Kansas City native I will never concede that much compares or appeals to me when it comes to BBQ. I am a BBQ snob but this was good, it was lean on a toasted bun and the various sauces I tried were all good..As I wolfed down the sandwich I kept looking at the \"to go burrito\" sitting there..I went to take just a bite and accidentally ate the whole thing..I was so ashamed but it was so good and I was able to forgive myself. This is very obviously a individual or family owned joint that takes pride in what they do. It is a take out place with outside tables in the shade if you choose to \"dine in\", it is worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place has the best brisket I have ever had. The sandwich is amazing because the roll is so fresh and soft. I loved the sauces too. Went back and had the red burrito which was also delicious but very spicy. I loved the spicy but you have to be in the mood for that. My husband had the green chili burrito and he says it is the best one her has had in AZ."}
{"text":"I've never been there myself, but my husband is a firefighter in mesa and goes there all of the time so he brought some home for me. I'm not sure what I like better, the beef brisket or the macaroni salad, they're both amazing!! The beef brisket has a great smokey flavor and the macaroni salad has a little sweetness that I love!! The mango salsa is pretty bomb too!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was amazing so I took my husband than we went again then we took our whole family who said it definitely lived up to the hype so I took my co workers who loved it and picking up some for home after work! I had the brisket sandwich, the brisket has an amazing flavor and the bread is perfect! Everyone I know who's had it craves it! It's a must! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while at a soccer game nearby.  It was the closest place recommended on Yelp.  We got there 5 minutes before closing and the line was long.  Well worth the wait!  We got a BBQ plate with several sides to take and eat while watching the game.  Best BBQ from a \"food truck\" I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"We love Jalapeño Buck's! Great food, and great customer service. Had a wrong order one time, and the manager went above and beyond to make things right."}
{"text":"We haven't been true regulars here but it doesn't mean we wouldn't recommend them. They are fantastic from start to finish. The owners are amazing. We've been here a few times and have used them for our business. Each and every time they have delivered amazingly. Yesterday, unbeknownst to me, my wife used them for a surprise birthday party for me and they supplied the pulled pork and phenomenal baked beans. Everybody was raving about the meat and as good as my sweet wife is with cooking, this blew her out of the water.  Last time we ordered from them we asked to have the burnt ends and man alive it was ri-dika-lous (purposely misspelled). I haven't had a better BBQ place in AZ yet. They've knocked the socks off of everyone else I've tried. We will be coming back again and ordering for our business too."}
{"text":"Wowza, this place has amazing BBQ. The meat is literally falling off the bone and the sauces provided are delicious. I will definitely be coming back to try the burritos and the sandwiches as they looked awesome as well. Service was quick and the people were very nice. Won't be my last time here that's for sure"}
{"text":"My husband is fantastic smoker of meats and every time we have BBQ out its good but it's never amazing....until now! Hands down the best brisket and ribs I've ever had. Everyone is very friendly here and I just love it. I can't believe I've lived in the east Valley all these years and never knew about it.  Tucked away amongst the orange groves, the outdoor eating is perfect for this AZ BBQ gem."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.. the best ribs ever.. wow.... great place..    I've had ribs across the country in the top BBQ places.. and I tell you what.. you need to show up hungry.. you will be one happy camper..!!!!"}
{"text":"First time today for lunch. Best BBQ that we've had in AZ, and that opinion comes from 2 southern die hard BBQ connoisseurs. Delighted to have such a cute, peaceful, country feeling, BBQ stand in east Mesa.  All the sauces are home made with incredible unique rich flavors. The owner, DeWayne came out and greeted us, asked about the quality of our food, then brought us out a complimentary sample of his salsa and chips. Good food, good people in a charming Orange grove farm atmosphere! We will be back a lot!  My only recommendation is you've got to add sweet tea!"}
{"text":"So impressive!!! Truly incredible in such a unique setting! I really loved the multiple sauces they gave."}
{"text":"Delicious food! You can't go wrong with Jalapeño bucks! We always end up getting their brisket sandwich but truly everything we've had has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Really good service but was not very impressed with the pulled pork. It does not taste homemade at all; more like the store-bought kind that you heat up in the microwave. Overall I would recommend because of the location and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I got the 1/4lb. brisket sandwich w/ coleslaw on top, and it was stellar. The brisket was perfectly done, the slaw wasn't too sweet, the bread was soft and chewy, and all tje sauces were delish (especially the Mud and Sure Crazy). My wife got the green pork quesadilla and it, too, was heavenly. Cheesy, just spicy enough for casual enjoyment (I like stuff hotter than most, though), and quite large. The beans and mac salad were equally scrumptious!  Service was quick, the staff were pleasant and exceptionally helpful, and it was just an amazing place for casual BBQ and Mexican. Plus, they had a crazy advert on Facebook where they had a helicopter land in the parking lot (as a helicopter pilot, I approve of this tactic)! Weird mix, but it works. Two thumbs up and five stars. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's a great spot for bbq enthusiasts and I've heard the pulled pork is great. If you're vegetarian or vegan, this is NOT the place for you - they have a bean and cheese option but the beans are cooked with ham hocks.   That being said, their BBQ sauces are INSANELY GOOD and are all homemade. The \"mud sauce\" is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place appears to be a little gem. The location is odd and thought it's close to where I work it is still slightly off the beaten path. I've driven past many times over the past couple years and never stopped but their social media (Instagram) account finally convinced me to go for lunch. I got there at 12:20 and the place was full with many waiting for their food and I still got mine within 5 mins from ordering. I had the 1/2 lb. brisket sandwich. The sandwich was amazing and easily over 1/2 lb of meat. It is probably the best brisket I've had in AZ. I had the macaroni salad as my side it and was also very good.  I'm a fan and will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy BBQ Batman! Love this place! Family run, so friendly and the BBQ is amazing! Homemade salsa and BBQ sauces are hard to stop consuming!  You can't go wrong here.   Thanks Jalapeno Buck's!  A++++"}
{"text":"Can't stop thinking about the red pulled pork burro. And their sauces are the . Just wish I lived closer. Seriously in my top 3 restaurants in the valley. We try to get out and try new things but I have to keep coming back here about every 3rd restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. My geen chili burrito was awesome and huge! There only problem is limites seating. The misters helped relieve the 90 degree sunshine."}
{"text":"Stopped after tubing and the food is delicious. I had the green shredded beef quesadilla. My friend had the brisket sandwich. We tried the chips and salsa. So worth every bit."}
{"text":"Smoked brisket was tender with very little fat - excellent flavor. Just right amount of smokiness, tender with a peppery finish. It melts in your mouth. Choice of four sauces-we tried the Mexican Hot and the Mud. The bun held together and was perfect. Excellent fare! Cole slaw a little sweet - not my fave. Thank you for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Don't get the burritos, since they are more like stew in a flour tortilla. However, I can recommend the bbq. I will continue going back for the bbq and for the laid back outdoor roadside vibe. I hope they rethink their burritos though."}
{"text":"I LOVE bbq... have tried out a lot of places in the valley but none can touch this joint.  I drive almost an hour round trip just for their food and there's usually a line, so worth it!  I load up on a pound of their dream worthy brisket, pulled pork, mango salsa and a side of coleslaw for the road while my son and I slowly enjoy a delicious shredded beef burrito at their comfortable location nestled in the middle of the families orange grove.  Reheating it tastes just as good as if you got it there, great quality and the perfect smoke on it. The oranges are also the best I've ever had! The prices are perfect and the family running it are exceptional!  You truly can't get better anywhere!!!  Saturday is rib day!!!! YUM!!!   LOVE us some Bucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Great smoked brisket, flavorful and moist.  The bbq sauces offered are excellent.  Sides offered are good. This is a casual stop with outdoor seating, great for lunch."}
{"text":"We love everything about this place. Good food, customer service, and environment. We always walk away happy and full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here, as promised. The brisket sandwich was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Whoa. Did not expect to be blown away like this. My uncle who is a local recommended this spot and I'm so glad he did. I had the green chile pork burrito with cheese and the flavors were so delicious. Service was friendly, the location was awesome tucked back in the Citrus groves, and the atmosphere was very cool and laid back. I also split an order of the brisket with my uncle and wow, these guys know how to do bbq. I didn't even really want to put sauce on it because the meat was so tender and juicy on its own. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. If you're passing through, Bucks is a must!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be coming back to try it again. The service was awesome and the food was outstanding. I would definitely recommend the brisket, it was tender and juicy and had the perfect balance of smoke and seasoning. It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I've tried most burrito's from here and the pulled pork sandwiches, all delicious. I have nothing bad to say about this place except expect to wait in line - it's well worth it but just know ahead of time that it'll be busy!!! Their location is hidden in the orange groves, just off the 202 on Val Vista. They have a cute little patio to sit and eat, the service is great and like I said..the food is even better!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious BBQ, and a wonderfully fragrant setting.  This is such a great place to visit on a beautiful winter day! I had hesitated to come here for a while, because I knew that there really wasn't a whole lot of which to speak of where Val Vista meets the 202 in Northeast Mesa. But my brother told me it was worth visiting and the reviews are consistently great, so I made it here with a couple of family members. I'll be making it here on a regular basis going forward, because it really is a great little place, especially on a winter afternoon. While sitting there waiting for our food, we counted no less than 8 hummingbirds feeding at the edge of the patio. The restaurant is only a few feet from Val Vista, but it's not a particularly busy stretch of the road.  Jalapeno Bucks is set among a bunch of orange trees and is next door to a citrus store that sells a bunch of the produce from the groves surrounding the place, along with some other tasty items (like Arizona honey and tasty candies). As soon as we got out of the car, we were immediately hit by two competing smells: citrus and BBQ. As we got closer to Jalapeno Bucks, the smokey BBQ smell won out, and our mouths were watering.  There are a few picnic-style tables under the roof of the porch. You order at one window and pick up your food when it's ready at the other window. The menu is pretty basic. There are a few different kinds of burritos: red chili with pork and green chili with pork or beef. There are a few sandwiches with different BBQ meats on them. Ribs are available on Saturday. They sell a few different kinds of salsa as well--all are pretty tasty, but not particularly spicy.  I tried all of the different chilis, but I preferred the red chili version that I ordered. The burrito came out piping hot. I tried to exercise some restraint in eating it so that I wouldn't burn my mouth, but I only had so much restraint in me. I may have burnt my mouth a couple of times, but it was worth it. This was a tasty burrito! The red chili was a little spicy--nothing overpowering, but I do consider myself to be a bit of a pepper belly, so keep that in mind. You can add cheese to the burrito for $1, but it was just fine without it.  I'm definitely coming back for more red and green chili and more BBQ."}
{"text":"By far the best brisket sandwich I have ever had!! The ribs were super good but the brisket with the bun was unreal. They have really really good BBQ sauces and their Mexican food was really good too!"}
{"text":"Super cool place!!! It was my first time here as I just moved to the area and a total stranger bought my entire $45 to go order...what a sweet man! We told me to enjoy my new home and this amazing food!! Mango salsa rocks!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jalapeño Buck's, but our most recent order was disappointing. My husband picked up two half-pound sandwiches with coleslaw, one with brisket for me, the other pulled pork for him.   Neither sandwich had much coleslaw, maybe a tablespoon and a half per sandwich; it did not even cover the meat spread thinly.  Definitely in the past they have had more coleslaw. Hubby did not like his pork sandwich and fed most of the meat to the dog.  I have never been a fan of their pork, but normally I love the brisket.  For the first time since I've started eating here, the brisket was dry and not tender.  It still had a good smoke flavor, but normally the brisket is very tender.  Unfortunately, the dog got half my meat as well. The two sandwiches were over $20 with tax, so this was an expensive fail. I am hoping this was some anomaly,  and that on the next visit JB will redeem themselves.  Normally, after eating their brisket, I'm craving it again by the next week.  This time I think it will be quite awhile before we return."}
{"text":"1 thumb up! The other one is compulsively guiding the tasty brisket to my mouth.  Get ready for an affordable and delectable trip back in time. Nestled in what remains of Mesa's Citrus farming past, they don't do a lot here. But what they do, is done with friendly moth-watering expertise.   If you like BBQ & Mexican fare and are up for no-drive-through Take Out or an outdoor, no-frills, picnic-table type dining experience read further.  Still with me? Good you're in for a total 360° feel-good experience. Your taste buds, stomach, and anyone waiting on you to bring them lunch or dinner will thank you.  J Bucks is hidden North of McDowell on Val Vista.   Their barbeque rivals anything in the Valley. For me, the brisket eclipses everything here. It is life-changingly phenomenal, moist, smokey... and will stick in your mind for years, trust me. Be sure to try the other BBQ fare, like the pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. But me, I gotta have at some brisket each time. When I go, I tend to get a brisket sandwich with bean and I share a red chili beef quesadilla with whoever's with me. The Mexican food is on par with what's available from local upscale sit-down restaurants. You'll love the various salsas, especially the mango.  There's enough here to change it up each visit without feeling in a rut... even if you're like me and have to get some form of brisket EVERY SINGLE TIME you drop by.  They had me at Jalapeño. They keep me coming back with great service, food, and the farm-style homey experience.  Look for the weathervane. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"WOW! That's what my husband said after his 1st bite of the 1/2 lb brisket sandwich, followed with, \"That's damned good brisket.\" My pulled pork sandwich topped with coleslaw could not have been better. Seems like they have a good following of locals because there was a line when we got there."}
{"text":"My company moved their offices to the Mesa area recently and my team and I have been looking for a new local food joint to pop in to grab a quick bite. I passed by Jalapeno Bucks on my way into work and saw \"Burritos and Barbecue\".... uh yes please.   Nothing short of spectacular. I got the green pork burrito with cheese for lunch and it is soooo good. The burrito was a big, flavorful, soupy mess of deliciousness. I've gone back 4 times now and each time is just as good as before. I got my husband the red beef burrito and brought it home for dinner and again, seriously good stuff here guys."}
{"text":"I love this place the brisket  sandwich  is outstanding  great iced tea great people  working  there they remember  my name  good bbq ribs just great"}
{"text":"Good stuff was very impressed! Best I've had in town behind Lil Miss. That Being said, you don't have to wait in the horrific lines like little miss BBQ!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!  Awesome setting.    We split a pulled pork and a brisket sandwich.   My wife enjoyed the brisket more than the pulled pork.  I say they were equally good.    There was a line, but it moved quickly.  They are closed Sunday and Mondays.    Definitely returning"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! I had the 1/4lb brisket.. SO YUMMY!! Plus the scenery you can't beat!! It's such a beautiful location and even better food. The sauces are great as well"}
{"text":"This is an urban citrus farm with KILLER Barbeque. Great prices and shaded seating. I would highly recommend. Can't wait to take out of towners..just not in the Summer."}
{"text":"That Peanut Butter and Jelly Brisket Sandwich AINT PLAYING!! I don't know what kind've bun they use, but its FIRE!!! The jelly actually melts into the bun and is not overwhelming while the peanut butter brings it all together. Try their take on burritos, it's delightful! They have different BBQ sauces in a bucket at each table and by far, my favorite is \"SURE CRAZY\" its a sweet sauce that compliments the meat. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Always tough to give 5 stars but this place is close already and I've only had ONE thing! I ordered the 1/2 lbs brisket sammie with the plan of jus eating half and saving the rest for later. DID NOT HAPPEN. I started and ate the whole dang thing. It is that good. I grew up in south Tx and Dad smoked a brisket almost every Sunday in my teen years. So I've had my share of brisket. This brisket is very rich in smoke and that's a good thing. The slaw on top was a perfect pairing with the spice of the \"mud sauce\". I am so full I'm telling people in my OFC I have something to do. I'm gonna go Power Nap now."}
{"text":"Ordered a red chile pork burrito with cheese. The food was so good. The people are friendly. I think I just found my new favorite place to get a burrito!"}
{"text":"Great burritos! Who even knew this little orange grove store was open all year?! Me and my kids go all the time now and we love the staff and the food.  Spicy but not so hot you can't enjoy it.  Right off the 202 north loop and Val vista.  So it's an easy stop.  Love love love this little place! Prices are actually very good for what amount of food you get :)"}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was excellent. Meat was juicy and smoky, although it was a bit fatty in places. Loved the mango salsa - the bags are chips are huge! A small could probably feed a family. Green chile pork burrito was also good, albeit a bit saucy - it's difficult to hold. The highlights were definitely the brisket sandwich and salsa. Would come again!"}
{"text":"This food is over the top. Best bbq in the valley area and beyond, and also at the same place, the best Mexican food in the valley. If you don't believe it, try it, that is if you can find a parking spot,,,,,,. The food will speak for itself...bbq sauces and salsa amazing,,,,just give it a try,,,,,,,,5+ stars......"}
{"text":"It is 100% outdoors in AZ, soooo not comfortable. They have misters but that's not enough. They also don't have any chicken or fish options. No bathroom for their customers. It really should be - $$ rating because they nickel and dime you for everything. Want chips and salsa? You have to buy the salsa for $6 and the chips are $3.50. We had bean and cheese burritos and they are DELICIOUS! This the 3 stars. Maybe it would be better in the fall and winter, and they should definitely have more options!"}
{"text":"Yet again we are here at Jalapeño Bucks again and  couldn't be happier to stop by our favorite BBQ place! We keep coming back for the great atmosphere and the amazing food. We usually order 1/2 beef briquet and 1/4 pork sandwich! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the beef brisket, and their BBQ sauces are amazing! The macaroni salad is sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"I take back a part of my last review. Nothing about it was false but I think the owners of JB are really good about listening to customers. I come quite often and I've seen noticeable differences. The portions are way bigger which is why JB deserves 5 stars.   But anyways.. Jalapeno bucks is truly tex mex food. It has barbecue and burritos. The brisket is awesome, and I like the red chili burrito. It's different than any I've had before. They slow cook it all day so it's super tender and has a great heat. There's nothing else in the burrito besides the pork, unless you ask for cheese and beans which is why I say it's different, and I agree that it's kind of liquidy but it's really good. I'm not a fan of the other two burritos though but you might like it. The Mac salad is sweet, pasta is al debate, and is the best Mac salad I've ever had. Beans and rice are also great. The beans are the best I've ever had.   As for the ambience, it's all outside so i prefer taking it to go. Service is also great. The couple/owner (my guess) is so nice and they always remember me! I can tell how much they genuinely care about JB.   My complaints are that Mac salad can occasionally be too drenched in dressing and they don't have the best hours (although the lady there told me they'd be expanding to Monday's when it gets cooler!)   Overall though the food is so worth it. It's worth trying out."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich's  are excellent, good variety of sauces, love the mac salad!! Family owned!!"}
{"text":"Have driven past this place 1 million times over the years. Finally decided to stop in with my wife today. Had the pulled pork sandwich and chips. Fantastic! The bun was battery and the pulled pork was amazing. got a medium size chips and they gave us a bag full of light and airy Tortilla chips. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best brisket I have had in a long time! Amazing sauce and flavors. Bread is awesome too"}
{"text":"Our go-to BBQ place here in the East Valley. The brisket is so tender and has a great peppery bark to it. Pulled pork just melts when you eat it. The buns for the sandwiches are sweet and always fresh and I love the special sauce they put on the brisket sandwich.   Haven't had the Mexican food from here, but we always leave with some of the Sweet Green and Mango salsa."}
{"text":"Cute little BBQ shack in front of a citrus farm. Has only been open a few months. There's also a farm store but that is seasonal. Very charming place, all new but old timey looking.   Stopped here after passing by several times. They were about to close on A Saturday night but were super friendly and happy to serve us. We split a 1/4 lb pulled pork sandwich between us, got coleslaw and a couple of lemonades.   Within minutes the owner brought it out to us, along with a bag of tortilla chips, hot & mild salsa, and 3 kinds of BBQ sauce.   The pork was succulent, juicy, perfectly seasoned and had a bacony finish. The sauces were all good, one was slightly sweet and smokey, one had the tangy taste of vinegar, and the last was spicy. Lovely soft roll that was not soggy held it all together.   Coleslaw was light and fresh. What you want in a coleslaw, really. I like pulled pork with the coleslaw on top, but my partner didn't so I ordered an individual side which was a very generous portion.   The tortilla chips were the thin and crispy type, very nice. Salsas were both fresh and tasty. Not sure if these always come with your meal or the owner was just passing them out because they were closing. He was chatty as well, obviously knew we hadn't been before. Friendly without being creepy, which is a bonus.   Prices are good, $6 for the sandwich which was easily enough for us two ladies.   Really the best BBQ I've had in the east valley, and on par with what I've experienced down south.   Closed Sunday and Monday, like everything else in Mesa. Just buy extra on Saturday and you'll be all right."}
{"text":"OMG...best bbq I have ever had in my life!!!! I've traveled many parts of the country and I can't believe this place isn't Internationally known. Absolutely, incredible. God bless the hands that prepare the meat. The only BBQ spot worth speaking of in Arizona (& the country imo)! Out of this world. Thank you, thank you. I would walk through fire to get to one of their beef brisket sandwiches!!! Outstanding. Mesa's treasure. It just doesn't get better than Jalapeño Bucks. It just doesn't!"}
{"text":"1st time I had Jalapeño Buck's was at a wedding. I thought the food was pretty darn good at the wedding so I wanted to try out the restaurant.   Went there today with a buddy and had the pulled pork sandwich. WOW! Very juicy, nice smoke flavor. It was so good and flavorful that I didn't need any sauce. Most pulled pork is a little dry and I always drown it with BBQ sauce.   I was too full to try anything else. I would definitely recommend this place. Just be aware there's only seating."}
{"text":"Great beef sandwiches and burritos.  There is sometimes a long line, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Found it by accident due to a freeway closure on a Saturday ride. Will be finding excuses to come back. Brisket is outstanding. Sauces are a perfect compliment. Awesome little atmosphere. All outdoor so July might not be your best choice for a time to dine in but misters make it bearable. If you haven't been here and like BBQ get your butt over here."}
{"text":"Any one who holds no love for jalapeno bucks can kiss my ass...... This place is so good. They get a little weird about hooking you up with extra sauce..... But the burritos are too bomb to complain too much about the sauce situation..... So good"}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwich with side of mac salad. Best brisket sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place based on all the GREAT reviews but I don't. The brisket was ok not the best nor the worst that I have had. The pulled pork was a joke. Pulled pork is suppose to be just that PULLED not MUSH. I could have used it as baby food. There was nothing to bite into. It was a greasy mush mess. Won't waste my time nor my money going there again. If I was the owner of Jalepeno Bucks I would be ashamed of what came out of the kitchen on Thursday. If you continue to serve mush pork your business will NOT grow and thrive."}
{"text":"OMG Jalapeno Bucks is to die for. I had the most amazing green chile burrito here and they have amazing mango salsa. I have yet to try their BBQ. I've had it twice and that burrito itself was enough to come back."}
{"text":"I've had both the green chili beef burrito and the pulled pork/brisket sandwich. I am not a huge fan of the green chili burrito, it just doesn't live up to the hype. However the pulled pork and brisket are good, and good luck enough that I'll return for them. The atmosphere is nice, however there isn't enough seating during the busy hours. The salsa that I've tried has been good, so overall this place is good, and I'll return."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and the food is amazing!! The burnt ends are awesome ! Need to order ahead of time to make sure you can get them.  Good Eats!!!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket sandwich is the best thing your could order! This is delicious! My husband is a big time BBQ Master in North Carolina...so I'm very picky with my BBQ and this was really really do it right! Great job!"}
{"text":"Jalapeno Bucks has incredibly good food. Located off the 202 and Val Vista in Mesa for easy access. If you want an awesome green chile and beef burrito, this is the place. The brisket/ cole slaw sandwich is my personal favorite. No inside seating, but there are picnic tables surrounded by orange trees. Great place for a family to gather."}
{"text":"I've tried barbecue from all over the country and this has to be authentic to Arizona. Nothing can match the different flavors of sauces you can spread on your food. I would recommend the brisket but the burritos are also tasty. Everything is great. Just come ready to wait a moment for your food and be sure to use the restroom prior as they do not have a public restroom."}
{"text":"Mexican food and BBQ in the same space is mind blowing! When I think Mexican BBQ I think carne asada but this place is so different. It takes a simple and delicious Mexican dish like Green Chile (both in pork and beef) and Red Chile and really makes it great. Then it adds great BBQ like brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Wow!   First the BBQ. I have only tried the pulled pork with the coleslaw and it was done very well. The serving is quite big with two options, 1/4lb and 1/2lb. You can always order meat by the pound as well. My favorite part was the BBQ sauce options that they bring out to your table. The BBQ is smoked with a dry rub and you have your option of sauce at your table. This style of BBQ they don't claim to be from any particular region. They call it AZ BBQ! Whatever they do it's great.   The sides. They have coleslaw, Mac salad, rice, beans, and you have the option to purchase a bag of chips. The rice and beans were good. Nothing amazing or different but good especially because the star is the Green Chile. The coleslaw is very sweet but complimented the spice form the bbq sauce I chose. I purchased some Mac Salad for my son but it was also sweet. It was like coleslaw with pasta added. Too sweet for my taste but not awful and pairs great with BBQ.   Now the Mexican food. The salsa options are there and their chips are warm and salty. Just what you need to accompany the salsa. The Red Chile from the burrito needed a bit of work and it's not what I'm used to. It needs more flavor. The menu said it was spicy but I didn't think so. The Green Chile burrito (I prefer the beef and make sure to add cheese) is spot on. I personally make Green Chile differently but it doesn't mean this isn't any good. It's not spicy but has flavor. The burrito is big and I shared with my husband. The meat on both Chile's is very tender. And the burritos are packed with sauce.   The menu is very simple and straight forward but the food is done right. The lines are always long but you get through it fairly quickly.    The ambiance is great! You're outside in a grove of orange trees. There's hummingbirds all around. This time of year it's great for eating outside. Please remember that there is ONLY outside seating at this place."}
{"text":"Great place and good value. Well worth a stop by. The burrito was tasty, the service was not only courteous but also swift."}
{"text":"Don't order the ribs here unless you LOVE FAT. No meat and all fat. What a waste of $25!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little place. Great BBQ nestled in the orange groves. I had the quarter lb brisket sandwich. It was fantastic. The brisket was tender with a great smokey flavor. The bun is like a giant homemade roll. I put the sweet sauce on it. It was a bit of culinary heaven. My wife did the bean and cheese burrito. It's an easy 10 inches. It's big. The sweet green salsa went well. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Talk about a unique place... Jalapeño Bucks feels like it's located in the middle of nowhere even though it's literally right off of the 202. As soon as I parked and got out of my car, I knew I was in for a treat. The smells of BBQ filled the air and makes your mouth start to water.   You'll most likely have to wait in line, but it's so with it. The menu is fairly simple but has all the \"staples\" of good BBQ. There are burritos, quesadillas, sandwiches and... just meat.   I ordered the brisket quesadilla and let me tell you... it was full of greasy brisket goodness! On the side I got their Spanish Rice which, I must say, is a must-have! All of that (along with a bottle of water) cake to about $15. Not bad for good BBQ as far as I'm concerned.   Only thing to be aware of... yes the rumors are true... no public restrooms"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this cute bbq joint. I do not normally like or crave bbq but this place has changed me! Super addicted to their brisket sandwiches and red chili pork. You can get the traditional style bbq on its own or change it up with a Mexican twist and make your meal into a burrito or quesadilla. Good quality meats and good service."}
{"text":"Wow! Who would have thought...amazing BBQ and good burritos inside a small shack in a remote orange grove? Very, very good 1/2 pound pulled pork sandwich and good but spicy sauce. Definitely going back...probably tomorrow -- only negative was they forgot to put slaw on my sandwich and charged me for it"}
{"text":"Best brisket in Arizona! It was tender on the inside but the outside was crisp and it was all juicy. The Green Chile Beef Burrito is amazing as well! The pulled pork was good, but I've had better. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone! The mango salsa is a different breed of salsa but it is definitely really tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ pork sandwich around! I love the sure crazy sauce to put on top! I only wish they had potatoes or baked beans to go with it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The pulled pork sandwich is amazing.  Their sauces are excellent!  Love the location,  just afraid they will get too popular!"}
{"text":"YIPPIE!!!! Our new family favorite restaurant.  We are now eating her about once a week.  They close currently at 6pm so call ahead if you are running late or keep that in mind.  It is a mix between a Mexican & BBQ restaurant.  Their salsa and homemade BBQ sauces are so delicious.  I recommend the Steak Burrito with Green Chili Sauce.  You can order the salsa in different sizes to take home to enjoy.  This is a small family run place.  It is not open Sunday.  Saturday they cook special bone in RIBS.  That is the only day to get the ribs.  They do not have restrooms unfortunately but who cares the food is AMAZING and the price is unbeatable.  I HIGHLY suggest trying it out you will be so happy you found this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I love this place.  We usually get the brisket and it's amazing every time. I'd eat here more often if it was close to home :p"}
{"text":"Great food. Do not pass this place up.   Great burritos, BBQ...get mango salsa for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket + slaw sandwich. Got a small bag of chips (think large bag of popcorn! Medium is a grocery bag, Large is a Hefty lawn bag.) Salsa and sauces are awesome. Seating is outdoors only, so weather could be a factor. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Saw this on Good Morning Arizona (Channel 3) and had to check it out. So glad I did. We stopped here after going to the Peach Festival in Queen Creek. That's another review, but won't go back there.  Anyway, when we pulled up there were cars lined up and down the road as well as a full parking lot. A group of firefighters were leaving and a few police officers ( that's always a good sign). I have to sayJalapeno Bucks is hands down some of the best brisket I've had here in the valley. Granted Little Miss BBQ is very good also, but the plus here is you don't have to wait 1-2 hours before they open. Prices are reasonable too, $16.00/lb. for brisket which literally melted in your mouth. The pulled pork was good but the brisket was the winner in my opinion. Nice smoke flavor and awesome rub. I also like that they give you a bucket with all 4 sauces to try. I liked the Crazy the best. We had a pound of Brisket and a pound of pulled pork. Definitely will be back. The owners are so friendly and went up to the table and asked how everything was. We noticed they were giving hugs to many of the regulars. Such a nice feeling here.  Oh, and $5.50 for a HUGE bag of chips!! Insane!! Love, love, love Jalapeno Bucks."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Arizona for a family wedding. We landed in the Gilbert airport and decided we wanted to go get some food. I've seen a lot of good things on social media about jalapeño bucks from people I follow, so we decided to go. First impression pulling up, absolutely love the atmosphere. It is so cute and vintage. There was a line, which you know means the place is good. The staff was so nice. We told them our story and when they handed out our food they gave us a sample of all their salsas and a bag of chips for free! How nice! on top of all their salsas they have buckets on each table with all sorts of their homemade sauces! They're all so good! My favorite was the mustardy bbq. My dad and I got a pulled pork sandwich, the bun was absolutely to DIE for. The pulled pork was also so delicious, tender and juicy! My dad also got their rice and fell in love! My boyfriend got a brisket quesadilla and omg it was so good! He would squish it and juice would come from the brisket inside! last but not least my mom got their green chili and brisket burrito and holy cow it's one of the best burritos we've ever had! My mom said it was the best green chili and beef burrito she's ever tasted (she literally wanted to stop and get one on the way home-put it in her purse and take it with us on the plane- that's how much she liked it). This place is a MUST TRY! HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"In the orange grove on val vista hidden in the trees-the most delicious smoked barbeque youve ever tasted,,,,the brisquet is amazing...this stuff they put on the bread compliments the smoky brisquet,,,and the sauce omg~I fell in love~"}
{"text":"Found this little hole in the wall type place in the groves out in East Mesa.  All I can say is wow!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best BBQ place I have come across in Arizona. There ribs on Saturday are to die for. My wife loves the spicy pulled pork sandwich & the brisket is done the correct way.   If your in the neighborhood this small joint in the orange grove is a must."}
{"text":"The most amazing BBQ/Mexican place I've ever been to!! All the employees and even the owners go out of their way to make you have the best experience possible! This will always be my families favorite food joint! Let's eat!"}
{"text":"Sauces are good (not mind blowing to my tastes), but I come for the brisket. Great smoke-ring and tenderness, moist but not chewy/fatty like some BBQ places."}
{"text":"Great place to start a tradition. Support this local business...it's worth it. Smokin' up some favorites and keeping things simple. YUM!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Really great barbecue in a fun outdoor setting! The brisket is awesome and the tomatillo green salsa they make is great (can be purchased to take home). We found this since it's next to our fave orange grove. Fun place to take friends and family visiting."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich is worth the stop! 3 kinds of Bbq sauces, all different but good. macaroni salad too sweet for me but I'll be back.   Order at window and eat outside, & no restrooms only slight downsides.   Haven't tried burritos yet but they seem popular."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ Brisket I've had. Found this place by reading reviews. What a gem! Hope they keep up the quality that they put into there food. We will be back,"}
{"text":"Wow. I was driving down Val vista and stopped at the city's grove because so many cars were parked on the road. Much to my surprise the tastiest beef brisket sandwich ever!  The big square bun gets toasted and comes with unique bbq sauce. I can hardly wait to try the rest of the menu. Outside picnic style eating. Family friendly. I bought some juicy navels and orange blossom honey at the citrus grove store as well. I heard the tangelos are sweet and drip down your arm juicy, while chatting with a gal waiting in line."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Bean cheese and brisket burrito is the way to go. The pulled pork is also a good second choice."}
{"text":"Delicious! Casual, laid back atmosphere. We got there around 2:30 pm and there was a line, as there was the entire time we were there. Usually a sign of good food and we were not disappointed! No inside seating, but plenty of shade and misters. We ordered the burnt ends, pulled pork, sides of beans, mac salad and cole slaw. Both meats were very good, but the burnt ends were our favorite by far. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I keep thinking I'm going to try their barbecue but when I get there I just have to have the green chili shredded beef burrito again! It is so good. I'm also addicted to the gringo green salsa! I usually get my food to go but I am looking forward to eating there when the weather cools down a little more. It isn't too bad with the mist system on even in the summer though. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Love the bean & cheese burritos. The sweet green salsa is good but really sweet so I like it in moderation. Chips are thin and crispy. Hours are short Saturday nights. Staff is always really friendly. My husband likes the green chili burritos."}
{"text":"Omg this place is a hidden gem, me and my wife came here for our anniversary and it was spectacular. We had the pulled pork sandwiches the meet was cooked to perfection. The service was fast and friendly the employees always kept a smile on there face and the cost was great for the amount of food you get. I would definitely suggest this place if you like BBQ food. The parking situation is not as bad as what I read before there seems to be plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Finally another BBQ place that is Amazing other than Rudys.  I highly reccomend this place. Everything tastes amazing!. I got the green chili shredded beef burrito and a side of brisket. Has amazing flavor and will definitely will be coming back here!."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on the way home from a hike.  I saw all of the great reviews so I thought it would be worth trying.  Unfortunately I wasn't impressed.  I felt it was very mediocre and not that flavorful.  I ordered a burrito with pork and the meat was ground pork, which I've never had before in Mexican food.  I expected shredded pork which would have been more traditional and likely more flavorful.  My friend has the brisket burrito and the grease was rolling down her arm.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Out of This World! Not Much to Say Here But.. OK They Want Me to Say More! Well The Green Chili Pork Burrito is My Favorite Hands Down! Flavors Like None Other! Come Get Some! #yumyum"}
{"text":"Wow........... wow! If you are looking for a lights out BBQ place this is it! I mean wow! First time here and I had the 1/2 brisket sandwich with the coleslaw on top and a side of mac salad. It was like eating a little piece of heaven! The employees were very friendly and helpful and it showed that they have a passion for serving others. If you don't go here we can't be friends ever!"}
{"text":"There is a pitmaster onsite! Pretty dang good brisket melts in your mouth a little bit of bark n bite action, real mild smoky flavor, super tender, this is the best bbq I have had in arizona solid 4 stars for bbq ( probably should be 6 stars cause ain't much good bbq in Az, this blows little miss wanna be pitmaster outta town jalapeno buck style kick in the face!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that this establishment does not have a public restroom or hand washing facilities. When asked, the cashier suggested I drive to a Walmart. It is set up as a take out window with picnic tables, so the place is exposed to all of the outdoor elements. They didn't have any BBQ sauce set out when we arrived, so be sure to ask for some. The food was above average. The quality of the meat was excellent."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident tucked away in an orange grove at the bottom of a small ravine. Went back for lunch yesterday and so glad I did. I had the 1/2 lb brisket sammy with the macaroni salad. To be honest I just wanted the brisket and was never going to eat the bun, but the bun they used was so soft and delicious, yet it stood up just fine to the meat and sauce I ended up eating it all. The brisket was perfectly smoked with a great smoke flavor. The rub wasn't overpowering. The Buck sauce was vinegar based and had a nice little kick to it. And the macaroni salad was good, maybe a little too sweet for my taste but I still ate it all. I will for sure go back, maybe today! They have a limited menu so be prepared. I saw lots of people ordering the burritos as well but I'm going back for more brisket!"}
{"text":"You know those places that are popular but not quite that well known? The ones that you're not sure you WANT to review because you don't want the lines to get any longer? I was conflicted about writing this review, but unselfishness prevailed!  :)  I am the husband who was brought here after my wife heard about and tried this place. I never would have found it on my own. Tucked in the orange groves in a little shed with minimal signage, along a route that I just don't take very often, if ever. Once you park in the lot shared with the fruit stand, just follow the line of people up to the little window in what looks a lot like a shipping container with wood paneling on it. Place your order from the simple menu, then wait for your name to be called. It couldn't be much easier.   I had a red chili burro platter, which was very simple and tasty. The rice and beans are nice accompaniments, but nothing nearly as special as the burro... or the macaroni salad. I'm not one who usually eats a lot of macaroni salad, but the platter came with it, so I figured I'd try it. It had a nice combination of flavors and textures -- there was so much food that I had to take most of the salad home. I ate the rest of the salad as a late night snack.   My burro was a large flour tortilla (very nice and fresh) wrapped around red chili stew -- and I paid the extra buck for cheese. The chili had a nice level of spice: not too much and the cheese probably helped cool it a little. Next time, I will try the green chili.   They have 3 kinds of BBQ sauce and a red hot sauce on the tables. The hot sauce gives a nice kick to the rice.  My wife had a brisket sandwich, which I got to try. The meat had a nice smoked flavor and was moist. I am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome, Smokey meat!! Having never been here before we ordered a little bit of everything. Some things to note: Medium Chips are HUGE (like family size huge), the Cup of Red is super spicy and yummy, the bean burrito is ginormous. Everything was super delicious and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I ate here, I had the green chili burrito and it was AMAZING! I always smelled the BBQ though, and finally decided to try it. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was sooooo good! Probably the best I have ever had. So good in fact that I went back and had another 3 days later, and am currently pondering having another today for lunch."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I've had in a long time. We had the green chili burrito and a brisket sandwich. Brisket was outstanding and the burrito was great. This is quality food that doesn't need to be covered up with really hot sauce. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was a great spot for dinner! It's odd to think they sell BBQ and burritos, but they do both so well!! I had the green chile burrito and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an authentic burrito. I of course had to try the BBQ the next time I went and that was even more fantastic. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting. I can't say there is any other bbq food out there like this, probably because there isn't. They have really good sandwich bread, its a mix between a sweet roll and sourdough. The brisket is tasty as well as the chili burritos - pork or beef."}
{"text":"BBQ brisket was AMAZING and you get a lot of food. We got the Mango salsa and chips, it was yummy and we might try a new flavor next time. We got a medium bag of chips which had wayyy too many chips for how much salsa we had. Wish they had some other sides to choose from."}
{"text":"This roadside take out place has the best ribs in Mesa. Get there early on Friday or you won't get any!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, GREAT food, good service, good location! Independently owned/operated and they are very friendly people.  We've been here quite a few times and it never disappoints. The BBQ is good from top to bottom! Pork, brisket, and OH MAN THE RIBS! If you get the sandwiches, make sure to add the coleslaw. The burritos are good as well, along with the green chili varieties of quesadillas."}
{"text":"This place is solid little find for BBQ.  I know everyone talks about the burritos, but I've been addicted to the brisket sandwich!! 1/2lb Brisket Sandwich add a scoop of slaw!! Man I've been telling myself I'd order a burrito each time I've come back but I have always gone to the brisket sandwich lol.  Great BBQ spot in the groves on Val Vista near 202 (north side).  I wish they did Ribs on more days then just Saturday.  They make there own BBQ sauces and they are amazing.  Only thing I'd like to see there is a good Potato Salad and some baked beans would be some awesome additions, only sides offered now is Macaroni Salad, Cole Slaw, Chips and Salsa.  All in all I'd recommend J Bucks if want some great tasting BBQ but they only have Brisket and Pulled Pork and Ribs on Saturdays.  So not many options but the Brisket is really good.  I can't speak on the Burros but the BBQ is worth stopping in for :-)"}
{"text":"First time going there. Very good sandwiches! Had the 1/2 brisket sandwich and it was good! No bbq slapped on there, which I like, you add your own. Very good place to eat I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Very nice outdoor seating. Caution: no bathrooms. Better relieve yourself before you come."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jalapeño Bucks is one of the best BBQ places around. If you're looking for delicious food along with great prices and service.... give them a try, they are well worth it."}
{"text":"They do not have public restrooms. I had the worst customer experience as a result of this. I brought my family of 5 there for dinner last week and we had just ordered our food when my 4 year old daughter indicated she needed to use the restroom. We went looking for restrooms and saw the sign that said \"No Public Restrooms\". I went to the counter to see if they would make and exception but I only received attitude instead. I then proceeded to ask where the nearest public restroom was located. The cashier said that there is one available on the corner of Val Vista and McKellips. So I left the rest of the family with my daughter in tow to only find more citrus groves on the corner of Val Vista and McKellips. The nearest public restrooms happen to be 4 miles away! On the corner of Val Vista and University. So not only does Jalapeno Bucks not have public restrooms but they do not even know where the nearest public restrooms are. So after an 8 mile round trip risking a toddler accident, I ate my cold brisket sandwich while the rest of the family waited as they were already done, ruining our family dinner.  - The Peanut Butter and Jelly Brisket Sandwich is delicious. I love this place, but they need restrooms. How can they operate as restaurant with no public restrooms?"}
{"text":"This place is super cool..out of the way, hidden and great eats!! I won't say its the best brisket sandwich I've ever had...... But it's the BEST I can't remember ever having! Wow.  Add their homemade Coleslaw to your sandwich... You will be very glad that you did. My friend had the green chili pork and bean burrito...outstanding!! He loved it and I tried it....now I don't know what to order next visit.   Must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Had the mango salsa which is superb. I like salsas that are a bit on the sweeter side and it had a perfect blend. Mind you a medium size back of chips is like HUGE. I wish we would have gotten a small. They give you like a brown grocery bag full of chips.   Also had the brisket sandwich. The meat was extremely well cooked I loved it. Bread was a little doughey tbh and the beans very average. I heard the Mac salad is terrific and I wish I would have gotten that.   Def the brisket and salsa were the highlights!"}
{"text":"We just finished trying Jalapeño Bucks and while I will say that I do believe some of these reviews are exaggerated, I won't say it's bad BBQ.  We tried a wide range of their menu to get a feel for it, including the green chile burrito, quesadilla, rice, beans, burnt ends, brisket and Cole slaw.  I wouldn't call it the best BBQ I've had by a long shot but it's not terrible.  I'm not certain if we will go back only because there wasn't any stand out items from what we ordered, but wanted to drop my review regardless because I saw a few negatives and felt the need to contribute a little kind honesty for those scoping this place out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  Green chili pork burrito is awesome!  Slaw is yummy.  BBQ is some of the best.  Good all the way around."}
{"text":"Oh my! This place is so delicious!!! We drove 30 minutes just to try Jalapenos Bucks. You get a farm-like feel to it, it's very nature-y! We probably only waited 6-7 minutes for our order. They have a variety of sauces - which were all tastey! There were a lot of people (which shows it's a great place to eat), so the only thing I'd recommend is probably more tables. But, I definitely recommend this place!!! :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight.  Shared red chili and green chili burritos withy wife.  I thought both were amazing, though my wife thought the red was a little spicy.    Also tried the chips (which were great), and the mild chunky red salsa.  It had a good flavor.  Next time I'll try the spicy green salsa it sounded really good!  Beans were good but not out-of-this-world.  The service was also great.  I showed up 20 minutes after they had closed and they were still happy to feed me!  My only complaint is that their hours are so short.  Unfortunate that they close at 6pm on weeknights, right when many of us get around to eating dinner.  Excellent food, look forward to returning!  They have a unique menu both with delicious burritos, and delicious looking smoked meats.  Look forward to trying the BBQ!"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos and sandwiches!!! Best brisket I've had in a long time. And their bean and cheese burrito is solid!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things and it definitely did not disappoint. I had the beef brisket sandwich with coleslaw on top and it was amazing! And it wasn't too heavy, which I sometimes find to be the problem with BBQ. I plan on going back very soon."}
{"text":"All I had were the brisket burnt ends but they rate with the best in AZ. Flavor was strong, Smokey, and tender. Bark was flavorful but soft. A little fatty but that's the flavor. I tried all 3 sauces. I want to try the ribs at some point."}
{"text":"Though out of ribs (probably due to summer weekend events), we chose a burro combo plate and a stuffed pork sandwich. So delicious and they don't skimp on the meat. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We just moved to this part of town and this is by far our favorite place!   So good!!!!! Haven't had a bad meal!  Everyone is friendly!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Kansas City and have been for the most part disappointed with BBQ in AS.  Not with Jalapeno Bucks.  This place has the best pulled pork brisket I've ever had.  Highly recommend this hidden gem"}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich I have ever had by far! The pork sandwich was ridiculously good as well! I think it tastes so good partly because of the delicious sweet sauces they use. The macaroni salad is to die for! A must try food stop!"}
{"text":"This is a fun/unique place to grab some food if you're in the area. I found that the food was tasty, but it's the atmosphere that makes you want to go back. It is enjoyable to sit outside among the orange trees and it feels very family-friendly. When we were there, the credit card machine was not working correctly and so our order was being calculated on a calculator and we were not confident we received the right total. Then we were given the wrong food. The young lady that brought the food to us was very apologetic and fixed it right away. She also brought us complimentary chips and salsa (a very large cup of mango salsa). The mango salsa is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food but not consistent will quality or taste. However, with that said it is never bad! Love the salsa and brisket! Wish their BBQ sauce was thicker, so as to be less messy. But flavor is there and always good."}
{"text":"So I've been sitting here wondering how this place has gotten 4 1/2 stars... Its been boggling my mind since I visited on Saturday afternoon. Going thru the reviews I see a ton of 5 stars from people with 1-10 reviews and no profile pictures, and some that have pictures, with very little reviews but seem to be just promoting certain business with 5 stars. Many of the negative reviews seem to be active yelpers. Makes you wonder what the deal is... I wish I would have noticed that before I spent my money here. To be honest with you if is kind of upsetting to know that Yelp has allowed all these (kinda fake) profiles up that just throw out 5 star reviews. Its misleading to genuine people that want to spend their money.   This place is located in the orange groves and literally .5 mile from where I was raised so I was stoked to hang out and have a green Chile burrito that I had read so much about. The line was pretty long which to me is a indication that it lives up to its hype. I got a green Chile beef burrito, my wife got the brisket sandwich and my daughter chose the quesadilla. We sat down and hung out on the outdoor seating (bench tables) area. The food came out pretty quick and just looking at it, the sandwich looked pretty good and the burrito looked.... well, like a burrito.. I was stoked to take a bite and when I finally did......... I felt nothing........ it was like goo with pieces of meat.... It had no flavor, no texture, no nothing... I tried to put some salsa on it to give it some flavor and that was pretty damn bland also. What a disappointment. My wife said her brisket sandwich was descent. She let me try it and again there was extreme smoky flavor to it and not much seasoning, the BBQ sauce provided I though \"(in the voice of Shania Twain) That don't impress me much\" when trying it. The only thing that came out AMAZING was the quesadilla, but how in the hell could anyone mess that up (I guess not melt the cheese). The visit itself to me was a waste of 30 bucks and my time. IM shocked that there are honestly so many 5 star reviews. I think something funky is going on there, and i'm not paranoid I went back like 8 pages...  I will not be going back to this place, aside from the mediocre food, the reviews have made me question the integrity of the owner. There are way better spots in Chandler and Mesa that sell real Green Chile burritos, and they don't have to lure you there with bogus yelp profiles full of 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"It's a delightful little barbecue stand, in the middle of a citrus farm---try the brisket, it's not half bad, not bad at all :)"}
