{"text":"Bomb BBQ. Every time we come to phoenix we stop by.  Same only problem it's a Pepsi account but they have mexican coke."}
{"text":"Good Texas Brisket served the way you like it, either moist or lean with sliced white bread. The ribs were ok, the beans plain and the sausage was again just ok but their brisket is great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a native Texan, and felt that Phoenix has been definitely lacking in the BBQ area.... not anymore! This brisket is awesome! So flavorful... don't need the sauce, just the way it should be. My only complaint is that they ran out of food! My fault for getting there at the end of the day. Also, proves that the food is good because they are selling out! I will be a repeat customer, for sure! The owner came by and thanked us for our business, and the other employee were friendly, too. Great experience, even better food!"}
{"text":"Texas APPROVED!  Being born and raised in Texas, this was the perfect place to try while visiting Phoenix. I got the lunch special which was 1/3 pound of any sliced meat, side and a drink for $10.99. I chose the brisket which was flavorful, moist and very tender. They cut and weigh the meat in front where you can see and serve everything on a tray with parchment paper rather than plates. The sweet BBQ sauce is just right and a great compliment to the brisket. I highly recommend it and can't wait to come back when in town."}
{"text":"Good environment, brisket is phenomenal. If you are hungry try the Texas Po-boy, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage on a bun. The mac & cheese used to be delicious...cheesy with flavor, seems the last couple of times it was lukewarm and the cheese was gritty. Other than that, great place. Staff is nice."}
{"text":"My wife is from Texas and loves BBQ. She has been in love with Dickies BBQ until one day I decided to switch things up. I came over to this BBQ place and wanted her to try it. Brought it home and her first reaction was this is my favorite BBQ. It's a million times better than Dickies. I ordered us the pulled pork and the serving sizes are very generous and better than most places. The Texas Po' Boy was AMAZING. The price is right for any appetite :) 
This place is a must. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Passed by last week and decided to stop for lunch.  Brisket was amazing almost as good as we get in Kansas City.  I would recommend checking it out.  Got my food fast and service at the counter was very friendly.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Texas BBQ House after seeing a menu that was dropped off at my work. First impression is it is a small place in a not so good location. A couple previous restaraunts were in the same location and had to close shop. To put it simply, I hope this place does not go anywhere. The beef brisket is great. Worth 4 stars itself. Barbecue sauce is on the sweet side but very tasty. Most meats are sold by weight. You have to arrive early if you want the moist brisket as it sells out early. The sides are not too much to brag about. Simple cream corn and baked beans are good, coleslaw is made fresh as I saw them preparing it in the kitchen, potato salad tastes as if it is purchased pre made.

I have eaten here about a dozen times and it always has good food. I however found another place that has a better smoke flavor to their brisket. Rudy's. Rudy's uses a real wood fired Oyler Smoker that produces a consistantly better flavor than Texas BBQ House. I will still eat here when I am in the area but if I had to choose, I am going to Rudy's as both places are the same distance from where I live."}
{"text":"I can never get here early enough. They are always closed, earlier than 7pm on top of that. Tried on Friday around 5:30pm four different occasions and they were closed each time. Are they only open for lunch or run out of food?"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. My first time they helped me order and I was very pleased.
These guys know how to BBQ. Awesome."}
{"text":"Was looking for some good BBQ after a long day of hiking...

THE SCOOP:
The food here is delicious. We had the brisket and the baby back ribs, which were great. A side of coleslaw and potato salad, and a banana pudding for dessert. Make sure to order the pudding! The staff was friendly, the place was casual with great outdoor seating. The BBQ sauce was definitely tasty.

THE POOP:
No alcohol is served (yet, they say), they did run out of some items (fortunately none that we wanted to order) and I wished they had a few more side dishes to offer. You eat on thick butcher paper (no plates), which worked fine for us, but definitely count this place as casual.

THE RECOMMENDATION:
We would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and was looking for beef ribs.   Arrived an hour before closing and scored a full rack of beef ribs to go.  The staff was very friendly and also gave us samples of the brisket.

The ribs were great and the sauce was awesome.  Great experience and will return again."}
{"text":"I wrote this review months ago, but still wanted to post.  Unfortunately this location has closed --- SOOOO sad.

My husband and I eat here at least once a week.  Consistently delicious.  Must try:  chop BBQ, spare ribs, and turkey.  I recommend getting a 1/4 lb of a couple different meats because it is too hard to choose a favorite."}
{"text":"We had catering from them. The brisket was probably some of the best brisket that I've ever had."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!   Knowing what real Texas bbq taste like I was skeptical but this really hit the mark, it's so frkn good....  almost just like my daddy's."}
{"text":"Needed a place for lunch the first time I was in the area.. Went there for lunch and dinner both days and now I'm back and made this account just for this place.. Best pulled pork ever and the employees are very nice. Will be going here all 3 days I'm here."}
{"text":"This is the best!  Their beef brisket is excellent along with every thing else. Also love the creamed corn."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Rolled into Texas BBQ house 5 mins before closing and owner welcomed us to place any order. Gave us samples of anything we wanted to try and a special side of his brisket. Delicious."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying it's hard to impress me with BBQ as I run the BBQ Club here in Arizona for a living.

That being said, this place is one of the best I have ever had.  Their Moist Brisket is nothing short of amazing, certainly the BEST Brisket I have ever had at a Restaurant.

Their Pork Loin & Sausage are also fantastic.  I'm still working on the rest of the menu.  I will post up more once I sample all of it.

I love their Cream Corn Side as well as their Banana Pudding, I could just go there and order those all day.

This Restaurant is one of the top BBQ Restaurants here in the Phoenix area and I highly recommend everyone stop in & try them out.  I know they are working on opening up another one in South Scottsdale and I'm excited for that one as I live close to where it will be.

Stop in, tell them you read the AZBarbeque review & post up your thoughts."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in the greater Phoenix area. That's right. I said greater Phoenix area. Because it is better than Rudy's (which I heard is getting a location in Chandler). How could I make such a huge statement? How dare I? Because I am from Texas. I know good down home service and food and this is it. Plus my fiance is a BBQ snob (also from Texas). He takes it very seriously (it's a little funny but cute). 

We got the brisket and the pork ribs with sides of creamed corn and beans. So good. Top it off with Shiner and I was in heaven. Seriously, I felt like a kid again just after finishing a long trail ride (minus the Shiner, of course). We also got to taste the jalapeno sausage and it was delicious. 

I can't wait to go back and try every single thing on this menu. The service was the best in the city. THIS is what good service looks like, Phoenix!! Y'all don't even know!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this place.  We went for dinner at 5PM this past Saturday and the place was locked up.  Checked their facebook page thinking maybe there was an entry of closure for whatever reason.  They HAD been on vacation but returned Sep 2....didn't work out this time around.  Next time, I guess we have to call ahead.  Very odd."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town (I am a Texan). Only downside is that half the times I go they are either sold out of meat or closed for the day to a catered event elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place...it's just...ah.  I forget things, you know.  My friends say that it's starting to really concern them and they've urged me to see a doctor about it, but I don't know...doctors are just...I don't know.  I really don't.

Anyway this place was great."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best brisket in phoenix. I should know as I've tried them all. I stop here every time I'm in the area. 
I'll often get the Texas poboi sandwich for lunch. It's a full pound of meat! 1/3 brisket , 1/3 pulled pork, 1/3 smoked sausage. Yummy.. 
The restaurant is usually busy, especially during lunch time. But the que moves quickly. The staff are friendly, and everything is always clean.
Make sure your good and hungry when you try this place.."}
{"text":"Great bbq, especially the brisket and the turkey!  Beware of the hot sauce, as it has some real zing to it.  I only had to go several times, so I can't comment on the dine in experience.  Great lunch to grab for a group at work."}
{"text":"The brisket blew my mind.While I am no expert,I did grow up in Texas and good bar b q was a regular thing for me growing up.That brisket reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Wow.  My sister was in town from San Antonio and I thought this would be a perfect time to put this place to the test.  My colleagues have been talking about it for months and it did not disappoint.  Her and I consider ourselves foodies and can be tough customers, but Texas BBQ House hit a home run.

PULLED PORK, PULLED PORK, PULLED PORK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here, the first time we got a sampler platter and that was good. But he second time we got the poboy, and that was out of this world incredible!  With excellent customer service and great food, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is friendly, fast and delicious. 
I am a huge fan of lil miss BBQ and go there often, but the line is sometimes something I can not deal with. This place is very close to as good, reasonably priced an now on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Awesome great love this place great service everything is decisions highly recommend please go here you will not regret it"}
{"text":"With out a doubt the most tender, moist and tasty brisket I have had since I left Houston. They offered samples of the meat before we ordered and to me that is pride in your product!"}
{"text":"Have been driving past this place almost everyday since moving here four months ago.  Stopped by tonight to give it a try.... Yum!  If you've ever had good Texas Barbecue, and have been missing it, this place more than satisfies... Wow!"}
{"text":"Simple great BBQ. Haven't been disappointed yet.

Prefer this place much more than Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's not the cheapest but absolutely worth the price. It was my first time visiting so I was able to try a fairly good size slice of brisket for free. I ended up getting the Texas Po boy filled with brisket, pulled pork and sausage. It was absolutely amazing and a huge sandwich I almost wasn't able to finish. There is a nice walk up condiment bar and the staff is nothing less than friendly and  enthusiastic. Only complaint is they don't sell alcohol so don't plan on having a beer with your BBQ. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, from Texas, knows her BBQ well, and she gave this place 5 stars. I have to agree. Now I've only had \"real\" Texas BBQ once before, but this place was just amazing. The flavors....oh the flavors. Very clean and comfortable place. The owners are really nice, and they have college football on all the time, you have to love that. Please try....you will go back."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ I have had since moving to Phoenix from Austin 8 years ago. I've been there twice in the past two weeks and I can't get enough! Now if only someone could open a kolache shop...."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sliders and they were awesome. A little bit of a line and parking was tough but it was worth it. Really great barbecue."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Very no frills, but all that energy goes into the meats.  We tried the brisket, the pork loin, the ribs, and the jalapeno sausage...all served in a soda basket on butcher paper.  The brisket and the ribs were my favorite, but they were ALL very tasty, moist, and cooked with some of the best rub we've had anywhere.  They were hoppin for a Tuesday night, so it looks like word has spread.  The only so so thing was the potato salad, tasted storebought, will get the cole slaw next time.  The pecan pie was a great finish. We WILL be going back. This spot is definitely a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ ever. I always get the moist brisket and Mac n cheese. The sauce is delicious and if you want dessert I suggest the banana pudding."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ then visiting this place will be a religious experience. Ribs, smoked turkey, links, chicken, are the best in Phoenix. The brisket is the best I've ever had anywhere. If you like BBQ then get there now!"}
{"text":"Texas BBQ House was the first to bring real Texas style BBQ to Arizona and on good days they do it very very well.

The problem is that they are not consistent - some days they are amazing, other days they are barely edible.

If you get lucky and catch them on a good day, their moist brisket is awesome and their pork ribs are amazingly awesome."}
{"text":"It took 15 f***in' years for real barbecue to make it to Phoenix. I've suffered the chains and the boiled gray attrocities that some chumps around town kiss with fire and then slather in spicy ketchup. Thank you guys. The meat eats rock and service is good 'ol, unmistakable Texan hospitality. It was good food made by people in a good mood, which makes it taste and feel that much better.

Shiner available but no Lone Star. All good. Also, I could use some type of green veg next time, even if it is fried. Perhaps some green beans with bacon and onion?

P.S. I'm a born and raised Texan. If you don't like that, **** you. I'm kidding. Bring on the jokes. Let's see what you got or if you just serve up the clichés you've heard in movies."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket!! The sauce is amazing too!  Sadly this place is on my drive home. I have to force myself not to stop."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with for a business meeting after having a yearning for BBQ for a week or so.  Ambiance was nice. Staff were friendly. First time so they offered samples, which was helpful. I ended up trying the beef brisket with a side of the regular smoked sausage. Flavors were good; all the meats are smoked so served \"dry.\"I really liked the home-made BBQ sauce on the side ... Thick, nice flavors, not too sweet. The outside patio was small but pleasant with picnic table seating. Definitely a plus for Phoenix in the fall/winter/spring months. All in all, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in town, hands down. I don't travel anywhere else but here now. The guys in the back are great and friendly and the food is excellent. The different cuts help with my mood, want lean you can get it, want moist you can get it, want extra fat you can get it. Service is quick and you are in and out with excellent food!"}
{"text":"F-. Food is way overpriced and its mediocre at best. You can get better bang for your buck at a steak house."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews but sometimes a place is so great you just have to. Been all over Texas having BBQ. To me Texas is the only place to get real BBQ. Texas BBQ House is the bomb. Real deal awesome Texas BBQ. Brisket was AMAZING!!!! Anybody who want the deal go here."}
{"text":"I was told this was the best place in Phoenix for BBQ by a friend and they were not lying! I came in for lunch today (4/24/2014) and had the Texas Po'Boy sandwich and potato salad on the side. The sausage, brisket, and I believe pork loin in the Po'Boy were tender and excellently prepared. If you come in hungry, the Po'Boy is definitely more than enough to satisfy that hunger as it is BIG. This is a true BBQ house and a definite 5 star place!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a replacement for Rudy's BBQ in Albuquerque ever since I moved to Phoenix 8 years ago. Texas BBQ House opened up just down the road from me and thank God it did. It may not be quite as good as Rudy's, but it is pretty close. 

I usually tend to stick to the lean brisket and turkey  to keep the fat and calories down and I enjoy both cuts very much. Some might not think they have enough flavor or juicyness. If so, try the moist brisket and the pork ribs. More fat and calories, but definitely more flavor. 

Everything is served in the traditional Texas style, on butcher paper. Your tray is an old soda crate, and your plate is a clean sheet of butcher paper. The staff will give you a few slices of white bread based on the amount of meat you purchased. More meat, more bread.  You grab the three common sides, pickles, onions, and pickled jalapenos seperately  and the BBQ sauce is at the table. 

If you want to purchase other sides, such as beans, cole slaw, etc, it is all there in the true Texas fashion. I recommend the creamed corn and the pinto beans. 

As I said before, I have definitely had better Texas style BBQ in NM and Texas, but this place holds it own. My only real issue is I wish they would make a spicier bbq sauce. 

I eat here about once a week, so the place definitely deserves a high rating."}
{"text":"I'm a Texas girl born and raised and I know good BBQ when I taste it. If you're not a Texan, you may not be aware of how serious BBQ skill claims are. Well, I'll tell you, its' pretty darn serious. So much so, that even though I haven't eaten meat in several years, I did the unthinkable.

My husband and I were walking around Old Scottsdale while on a trip from Colorado and saw the Texas BBQ House and decided to have lunch there to see if it lived up to its name. We walked up to the counter where we were greeted with the friendly staff offering samples of any kind of meat on the menu. 

While normally I would just opt for vegetarian sides, I became so distracted by the divine aroma coming from the pit, that I think it hypnotized me into wanting a sample. Now a good bbq place will always have at least 2 kinds of brisket - lean and moist. They had a 3rd kind which was cutter's choice. My husband sampled the moist brisket and was oohing and awing that it made me want to see for myself so I sampled the lean brisket. And yes, I heard a choir of angels sing as it melted in my mouth. The clouds parted and heaven's light shone upon that delicious piece of brisket. Just the right flavor of smokiness, definitely lean, I'd have to say the best brisket I've had anywhere, that includes the great state of Texas. To my husband's (and my) surprise, I asked for half a pound and began to check for the other Texas obligatory staples that are absolutely necessary. 

BBQ Sauce - check, they have two - original and spicy, both yummy - though I liked the spicy better. Sliced white bread - check... no nut-covered, artisan bread thank you, just plain, sliced white bread. Potato salad, beans, cole-slaw, creamed corn, check - the creamed corn was the best I've tasted, ever. I can eat an entire soup pot of that. Sweet tea, oh yes. I didn't even have to add more sugar. Fixins - check - which if you don't know, include, pickles, onions and jalepenos. These are a must. 

AND... the meat and bread was served on butcher paper atop Pepsi crates! Texas BBQ indeed. 

This is not to say that I am a converted vegetarian and now a meat eater. I've decided that the only time I'll eat meat is the next time I'm in Scottsdale, at Texas BBQ House - which a trip to AZ just for the brisket would totally be worth it."}
{"text":"Today it would have been nice if they would have posted either on their web site or on Yelp, they were closed for vacation before I drove out there from North Phoenix.  Disappointment.  I think the sign stated they are closed until 9-8-2017."}
{"text":"I've just now come down from the high that Brooks' Place gave me eating brisket in FOR REAL ACTUAL TEXAS (see the review I made just previous to this one), so I actually went searching for a place close to home that laid claim to Texas fame. I was excited to find the Texas BBQ House with such glowing reviews. It's good, it really is. Unfortunately, it ain't quite the same. 

Naturally I had the brisket. I mean, it *is* the \"Texas\"  BBQ House, right? It was good. It was tender, it was smoky, it was probably on par with the best I've had in Phoenix (which was Bobby-Q by the way, but that was a long time ago). The problem is, it didn't blow my mind, and as I mentioned, I recently had my mind blown by brisket in Texas. Maybe that isn't fair, I don't know. It is what it is. 

So then what we have here is basically \"competent,\" and \"at least as good as anything similar you'll find elsewhere in Phoenix,\" which seems like faint praise. But brisket is hard. I make my own (and I'm no slouch myself) so I know exactly how hard it is. So really, just to say it's as good as I've found in Phoenix is pretty high praise. 

The real problem is, little else caught my fancy. I had cole slaw on the side. It was unremarkable - could have been bought at Costco. They have one sauce, it tastes like... nothing. Like Kraft. Boring and unremarkable - and no spicy option. 

Add to this that my *first* experience at TBBQH consisted of being turned away by a sign at the door saying \"SOLD OUT\" (at 4PM) and well, you basically get a three-star \"average\" review from me.

I really prefer my competent brisket to be served with mind-blowing sides and sauce(s). Alternatively, you could serve me mind-blowing brisket and merely competent sides and sauce(s) and maybe you'd get up to four stars. Either way, that's not what I got here.

Prices were OK, I suppose, $14 for a half pound of brisket, a couple ounces of cole slaw and a drink. Beef ain't cheap these days, that's for sure.

I do like the way they serve their wares - real deal Texas. Butcher paper, white bread. Plastic forks and knives. The place looks like a dive and is in a crap neighborhood, and honestly, that's all as it should be."}
{"text":"Another great meal - cutter's choice brisket, a couple of sausage links, and the pulled pork for a group to share. Along with some excellent coleslaw and potato salad.

We appreciate that they don't want food to go to waste at the end of the evening, but we often need to make some substitutions on what we order if we get there after 6 pm. Last night we didn't get there soon enough, and the creamed corn was sold out. Other times it has been the regular sausage links.

Fortunately the other choices are excellent too - we just have to make those minor adjustments, and have a back up plan of what will take the place of the item that has sold out.

This is by far the best BBQ we have found, and we are fortunate to have it in the South Mountain area."}
{"text":"Food was delish

two orders of ribs = 3 Ribs

thats TWO ORDERS??????????"}
{"text":"Two times this month we have had them cater to our office. This is at my guys request. They love it. Food is always good always fresh and the help is great. They deliver they setup; you will love their catering service. Give them a try you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is some of the best barbecue I have had in a long long time.  Real Texas style. Pork ribs falling off the bone and brisket melting in my mouth. 
I will definitely have to come back here again. Did I forget to mention the pecan pie?"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Among the Best BBQ in phoenix! I always get there poboy sandwich $12.99. It can get busy in afternoon's on weekdays. Try to get in early for easy parking. 

There is a living social deal , but that's not valid for daily specials or poboy sandwich. IMO deal is not worth it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. It's excellent every time we go. The brisket is the best I've ever had. The desserts are to die for. The sides are down-home cookin' at it's finest. I wish their hours were extended!"}
{"text":"Amazing brisket and Mac n Cheese!! The spicy BBQ sauce is killer!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ Restaurant in the Phoenix area! Amazing brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. All the sides are exceptional. My favorites are the beans and their macaroni and cheese. Leave room for their banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've ever had.  I'm not from the area and will be back whenever my travels bring me to Phoenix.  The moist brisket was a religious experience, the ribs were amazing, jalapeño sausage was perfect and the cole slaw was just right.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Good food. They know they run out and they are usually always busy. How about being smart and making more food and hiring a couple more staff. We know you aren't hurting for the money."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's a small place but they are very friendly and offer up samples if you want to try one of the meats.  They cut the meat right behind the counter and it is always great.  I have had the brisket, pulled pork and the sausage and they were all great,  I really like the sauces as well, although the spice sauce definitely has a kick."}
{"text":"B B Q started here!  The chef  knows how to cook!  New York steak medium rare was YEAAAAAAA BUDDY good!!


-Cheers-."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had.......
I was asked to pick up food here for a work colleague , and 24 hours later have already been back.  I have my own smoker, and am a very good cook, but I, nor any other place I've ever been to, comes close to this.  The brisket fell apart when I picked it .  No knife required,or sauce IMHO.  The cole slaw was some of the best I've had as well.  Took some home to  my family and there was a fight over it.  
This is by far, the best BBQ in AZ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brisket I've had in Arizona.
The meat is tender and moist in all the right places.
There online ordering is quick (unless you use the famished app which has failed to work once since I tried using it). Customer service is great and they always have a smile and greet you when you walk in. Keep up the good work!

Update:
I have used their famished app attempting to get food and the majority of the time orders are not accepted. I got emailed a coupon by them to use with the app! The app failed and I went in and showed them it failed and I wasn't allowed to use the coupon on the app again saying I already redeemed it. They refused to give me the discount! Bad customer service. Their food is amazing but get it together with your online ordering and don't send coupons to customers then refuse to accept them."}
{"text":"Appears to be a family run joint.  BBQ is solid.  I had brisket w a little fat, side of coleslaw, and a roll.  Made myself a tall sandy for lunch by adding pickles and a sliced pepper (hot as hell).

Service is great.  Appears one of the kids works the floor, and he's sharp as a tack cleaning up after customers.  Even offered to run down a drink refill for me.  

Great booths to sit in, tvs playing sports, comfortable covered outdoor patio, etc.  

Only drawback was this big banner on the side wall that read, \"You're in (Dallas) Cowboy Country.\"  Eh, I hate the Dallas Cowboys, but I didn't see Tony Romo or Jerry Jones, so I'll come back for the BBQ."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ House is the real deal! Awesome food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"went in today 2/12/13 had ordered mac n cheese, cutters choice brisket, pulled pork, and pork spare ribs. 

First and for most I went in around 1050-11am and didn't eat until just after 1130 since I was waiting for my wife to go on her lunch break (shes a teacher in the area).

mac n cheese: warm and filling with a great flavor not to much of anything though i could have used a little more pepper in mine that is a personal preference.

Cutters choice: With a nice thick smoke ring and a nice flavor profile the cut melted in my mouth. my wife and I made it into sandwiches and with a small amount of there spicy BBQ sauce I devoured this great meat.

pork spare ribs: now let me start off by saying that Ribs are my personal choice in choosing a meat to smoke and i like mine sweet. But I had to keep in my mind open. The meat had no pull which is something to look for in a good rib. The ribs had a good flavor with the major flavor in mine seemed to be pepper but man let me tell you that these were on point. If you understand Texas BBQ you know that it rarely comes with a BBQ sauce which was the case her and honestly it didn't need it though some may say it did. 

At this point in our meal I was full and was unable to get and of the pulled pork but my wife said she enjoyed it with just a little of the original BBQ sauce. 

I highly recommend this place i know i will be back as long as they maintain the Q.

{"text":"Hot damn this BBQ is no joke. Don't let the area turn you away, it's 100% worth the drive. The moist brisket is absolutely incredible and not to be missed. My last visit I ordered the Po Boy sandwich and it was outstanding. A third pound each of sausage, pulled pork, and cutters choice brisket, all for only $10 and unbelievably delicious.

Staff is awesome and for what you're getting it's worth the price. Definitely making Texas BBQ House a weekly tradition."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ House catered my daughters wedding last  week & they did an excellent job. We got so many people saying how great the food was. We had it buffet style so there were different items to choose from....everything was delicious! They're staff was so great & friendly. I highly recommend their restaurant or using them to cater your event!! Thanks Mike, you & your staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"I am from Arkansas and have always been of the mind set that you can't get great BBQ outside of the mid-south or my own backyard smoker. This myth has been disspelled by the Texas BBQ House. Their pork ribs were tender and juicy. The brisket was outstanding. Even though it has a rustic looking exterior it was very clean and the entire staff was extremely friendly. I have already told several friends and plan on using their catering service for the staff at my work. Beware the samples-you'll want to buy everything on the menu :) ."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good! Do not let the outside fool you...it is not what you would expect on the outside but the inside is just what you would expect a BBQ place to look like. Today was our first time trying it and the girl at the counter was very nice and offered us samples of the brisket. The meat was so good and tender. I am so happy we found this place down here in this area!."}
{"text":"Great low key spot!  We loved our food here.  To be honest this is where we ended up after Little Miss was sold out BUT we were very happy!  The couple that ran the place were very sociable and we actually talked for some time.  My partner in crime for the week was visiting from Florida and we ended up giving the guy and his fiancé a bunch of recommendations for his trip down that way soon; so I hope it all works out! The pulled pork sandwiches (with) coleslaw that we got were wonderful and our bellies were full!  Sweet tea was perfect and we had a side of potato salad which is made how I am used to, being from NC, so I loved it!  We would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, very juicy and tasty, and reasonably priced.  Just removing a star because on Yelp it looked like they serve beer (they don't).  I'd definitely come again"}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in Phoenix! Shared the sampler platter with friends, everything was done right! Brisket and ribs were to die for...potato salad and green beans were perfect. I will be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"It's wonderful to once again have excellent BBQ in South Phoenix :-D

We had the moist brisket, sausage, sweet corn, and pinto beans.  The brisket had a wonderful mild flavor and doesn't need sauce unless you want a bolder flavor.  The sausage was delicious and made a great sandwich in the white bread with onions and sauce.  The corn and beans were delicious!

The setting is cozy and casual and the staff were great.  One minor complaint was that the unsweetened tea was over-brewed to the point of being bitter.  That aside, we loved it and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The jury has deliberated and the verdict is in....a easy five stars people. This is just good que!  That's it people, if you're reading this review stop...... go and order food and then go ahead and drop five stars in your review. 

The place in South Phoenix next to a beauty shop. It may not be easy on the eyes  driving up and looking at the exterior; the inside isn't must better, however, it is clean.   

The people working here are down to earth, you'll hear good ole country music playing in the background and you can count on seeing NFL network playing on at least one TV.  They serve your food in Pepsi and Coke creates, don't go looking for plates cause all you'll find is ole fashion wax paper. 

If you don't like this place I would like to understand what makes you rise to the level of nirvana.   

The parking lot is..... the first word that comes to mind that's smaller than \"tiny\". I would say parking is intimate but that's the adjective."}
{"text":"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que. 

And for those \"the meal in a carton on butcher paper\" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers..."}
{"text":"Going to Texas BBQ was a last minute decision in an unfamiliar area after meeting a client over the. I left the meeting feeling really hungry, so I got on to Yelp to find a place to eat. After seeing so many 5 star reviews, I had to check it out. Not only were the staff nice, but the food was amazing. We had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, jalapeño sausage, green beans and coleslaw. I have never had such tender brisket or tasty ribs. It is worth checking out. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best part of this place might not even be the stellar bbq. It might be the folks who run it. Great people. Mike is very gracious with his time and bbq. I never miss an opportunity to stop by. 
I take my bbq seriously and this beats every other place in town. Just call ahead or get there early. That moist brisket goes fast. Especially if I'm there."}
{"text":"drove past and saw the sign, and after having spent several years in Texas, had to try this place -- and was extremely impressed. I had the moist brisket, and even without sauce, it was awesome. Nice pink smoke ring, moist and tasty. They even had the sides of dill pickles, jalapenos, and onions -- yum!

I also had the cole slaw, and it was very good as well.

I definitely want to go back and try the hot links and the turkey -- but both my friend and I really enjoyed our first (of many to come) visits."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed here is that the wait time wasn't bad at all, but I came early for lunch on a weekday.

I tried to brisket and the ribs. The brisket was really, really good. 5 stars by itself. The ribs were kind of touch and chewy, and I wouldn't bother with them again. The sides were pretty dang good as well.

I'll definitely come here again when I want some good brisket and don't want to wait in line for 45 minutes at the other place I like to go."}
{"text":"Did this place close? 1pm on a Sat and no sign of life. All the roll downs were closed too."}
{"text":"Amazing brisket. Best i have had in years!  Wonderful staff, friendly service. Don't judge by the outside, get in there, son!"}
{"text":"Visited Texas BBQ House for lunch after hearing reviews that it rivaled one of my favorite BBQ joints in Phoenix, so I wanted to check it out. Anything with Texas in the name has my intrigue when it comes to BBQ

First of all, you get $3 off for checking in to Yelp which is a huge plus in my book. Great move by the owner. The parking is a little sparse, but we managed to get a good spot with minimal line. They have a great selection of BBQ from both fatty and lean brisket, to their signature sandwich the Texas Po Boy. The prices were consistent with other BBQ joints.

I ordered the Texas Po Boy because it covered the main types of food you're looking for: brisket, pulled pork and sausage. This sandwich is huge and comes with plenty of meat. I'd suggest it if you're coming hungry and ready to eat. It was quite tasty for every bite. The down side for me was that the sausage tended to overpower the other meats, which makes sense due to the strength of sausage flavor as a whole. I also wish they had their own BBQ sauce selection for customers. I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce they put on the sandwich for you. I would have liked to add my own, and had options like you do at other places. If you're getting brisket, I would recommend getting the lean. My friend had the \"moist\" brisket and it had a little too much fat on it. That was coming from a guy who loves fatty brisket.

All in all, it was a good BBQ experience and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good BBQ and not in the mood to stand in line for a long time. I would definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"We came at around 4pm, all they had left was 1 order of ribs,  1 order of pulled pork, turkey & sausage. We were really looking forward to brisket, but we decided to try it anyway. All the food we got was excellent!! Kids loved the sausage & mac n cheese. Hubby loved his ribs & coleslaw. I quite enjoyed my pulled pork & pinto beans- spicy! Pepsi products for drinks with Big Red! Decent prices for fresh & authentic Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had probably ever. I got the Texas Po Boy which is a 1lb sandwich for $13 that uncles a 1/3 lb of each brisket, sausage and pulled pork. Unfortunately they were out of pulled pork but doubled up the brisket instead. I split it with a carnivorous boyfriend and we were both happy. The meat is moist and flavorful. BBQ sauces were a delightful condiment, not overpowering. 
Soft drinks, takes cards. Nice cold inside and clean tables. Service was amazing and provided generous portions. 
Can't ask for more and will be back."}
{"text":"The good: The creamed corn side.  A. Mazing.  The service...very friendly.

The so-so: The brisket that's mixed with sauce was very lacking in flavor.  The sliced brisket was much better, but had lots of fat in it, which I don't like (some may).  There were 2 sauces, didn't really care for either of them, both are pretty spicy (I like spicy, but just FYI for those who don't).  

The bad: The bread they serve the meat on is like wonderbread.  

I probably will not go back, but 3 of the 4 men (my co-workers) whom I've gone with have all been back multiple times."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's delicious. The people that work there are super friendly and let you sample if you aren't sure what to order. Make sure to stop by earlier in the day because at the end of the day they don't have every menu item- I can understand why."}
{"text":"It's always a good idea to wait a few hours before writing a review. I had six pork ribs, half a smoked sauage and a small side of green beans. Cost with small beverage slightly over $22. The food tasted great with the ribs looking cooked to perfection, BUT a few hours later...I could not get off the toilet. I don't know if they used MSG in the food or what, but it doesn't matter how good the food tastes going down if it gives you \"Montezuma's Revenge\" later! I was going to give it 4 solid stars, subtracting a fifth star for boring sides and dilapidated seating, but I cannot say I'll be going back...except to my bathroom!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The briquette is one of the best I have ever had, and the po boy sandwich is phenomenal."}
{"text":"My wife was born and raised just outside Houston and I've traveled all over the country on business and in search of great food. I never thought I'd find a place that could even come close to The Salt Lick or The County Line in the Austin area, but folks, this is the real deal. These boys know how to whip up a batch of Texas best vittles this side of El Paso! Don't go gettin' all dressed up for this one, 'cuz you are going to be wearing (and bringing) some of this home! The down home atmosphere and Shiner Bock on ice is just the start, and the finish with some pecan pie makes it all come together at the end! Great place to take the family, friends and their families, too!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I don't know why it has such good reviews...maybe I came on a bad day but the food was cold, the soda was watered down and the employees rude. Not to mention its way out of the way in a not so great area. 

If you are looking for good Texas style bbqB try Rudys or Alisons."}
{"text":"Great meat and perfect country feel at this place. Best pulled pork I've had in years! Definitely the place to go for some real BBQ"}
{"text":"I found the meat, although tender, lacked seasoning.  It was very smokey, which I like, but a little more seasoning will push it to more stars.

It is a bit pricey as they charge by the pound."}
{"text":"If you're hankering for some real Texas BBQ on the Southside of town look no further. Albeit this place is smack dab in the ghetto but when you walk inside the atmosphere is very rodeo-ish.  The guys behind the counter are extremely friendly they even offer samples. MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH!!!! I hate it when restaurants make you pay cash, but it does keep the operating cost down for small business owners. On the bright side there is an ATM in the store so don't worry if you forget to bring cash. Let's get down to the star of the show; the MEAT! I had the Brisket and the Jalapeno Sausage both were served in meat paper not plates. The flavors were fully developed and easy to chew. For sides I had the Potato Salad which was standard and the Mac & Cheese which was nice and cheesy. It is a bit expensive but what good BBQ isn't. This place sells the items ala carte with the exception of the daily special. I will be back for more! Oh yeah, the BBQ sauce was served on the side and was a nice touch to all of the food"}
{"text":"Best bbq I have had in phoenix HANDS DOWN! Moist brisket is the business! Ribs, chicken, jalapeño links, potato salad, Mac n cheese, topped with that spicy bbq sauce and pickles and jalapeños on the side! With all that amazingness AND a great friendly staff how could you go wrong? Thanks for making my stomach happy time and time again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been there for lunch several times. The BBQ doesn't even need BBQ Sauce. The sides are savory and delicious too! The Po Boy is awesome and the brisket is to die for. The staff is friendly and helpful. Try this place if you love BBQ!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now but haven't had the chance and conveniently enough it's down the street from my house so it wasn't much of a drive. It was my first time and I ordered to go. The staff was friendly and the environment was good, only the parking lot is a small and tight but their food is worth it! Got two different kinds of ribs and cream corn soup and it was amazing! Definitely returning for ribs! Too bad they don't  deliver. It a hassle for me to take my 18 month old with me. If you haven't tried them already you should!!"}
{"text":"A little of everything....juicy brisket, jalapeño sausage, pork ribs with a great pink smoke layer, green beans made the way I like em, creamy Mac and cheese and banana pudding like I had when I was a kid. My stomach feels like a ripe melon after putting all this down. 
I will have a nice nap on my flight back to Texas!"}
{"text":"Awesome brisket and great, fast service. Will be coming back next time we have a hankering for bbq."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ House has the closest thing to Texas style brisket that I've found outside of Texas- props for offering it three ways, moist (fatty cut), cutter (chopped), or lean (why?), with my preference obviously being the first. Squirt on some of the \"hot\" bbq sauce (unless you're a pansy, then choose regular), add on a couple pickles, and it's heaven. White bread and red onions are optional. 

Heads up, even though the wait time isn't nearly as bad as Little Miss BBQ, if you don't go early they'll be out of a lot of things, most definitely the ribs. Even going in an hour after opening on a weekday, they were down to just brisket, pulled pork, and sausage. That said, I'm not much of a fan of pulled pork but theirs was really good: not too saucy or too sweet. Hot links were solid, too. 

Loved the atmosphere with picnic tables and outside seating, country music blasting, and three different football games playing. Really hit the spot when I was feeling homesick during the holidays. Opt for the $13 1-pound Texas PoBoy if you want a taste of everything!"}
{"text":"Tried the Texas po' boy. It is freaking good. They allowed the swap out of the links for more pulled pork, that rules. Really some of the best pulled pork ever. The brisket was unbelievable too, and I don't even like brisket... Unfortunately they were out of beef ribs so I cant even imagine how good those are, will obviously be back to try them. Really nice people too. So far this place is better than Rudy's (pulled pork wise and sauce wise) I just wish they had baby backs instead of the St. Louis cut so cant really make a conclusion until those beef ribs have been tasted."}
{"text":"On our most recent trip to Phoenix, we set of goal of eating at a new BBQ place every day.  We avoided our regular haunt (Rudy's) and selected the new places from the best of Yelp and recommendations of local friends.  We found some winners and some losers, but Texas BBQ was by far the best of the bunch.

I had the Po' Boy special, which was a sausage topped with brisket and pulled pork, nearly a pound of meat.  All three meats were top notch, but the brisket was significantly better than most places.

My wife decided to go with the turkey breast and the creamed corn.  The breast was very moist with a nice smoke ring.  She also really liked their sauces, but her favorite of all was the creamed corn.  They make it from scratch, and it has a bit of Jalapeno for flavor.  I've never had a creamed corn that quite matched it.

The owner was very friendly and helpful, and allowed us to sample several other meats.  His young son was clearing tables, and was very polite and fun to chat with about the pit and the business."}
{"text":"I love walking in & smelling the smoky goodness. Friendly, fair prices and GOOD food!  I love barbecue and they do it right.  Quick service and I love the prime rib.  The spuds are back, smoked baked potato loaded with meat.  Their creamed corn is real, homemade and incredible.  I didn't like creamed corn before this but it's a whole new level.  Green beans are cooked with the brisket and well worth it."}
{"text":"You ever have the Experience, where you just appreciate goodoll A friendship feelin. My first time stepping into the restaurant. I was greeted with pure LOVE. This is a family owned business from Texas that takes wonderful care of their customers. Letting them know it was my first time they let me try the brisket. the inital sample had me hooked like a Giant 15LB catfish.. I wasnt going to leave this place.. I became a customer for life once I had my order! I CAN SAY TRUTHFULLY THIS IS THE BEST BBQ IN TOWN.. Since my first time I have been 3 times a week faithfully! I move to mesa so i am not able to visit as much but i can tell you... IF YOU WANT THE BEST BBQ IN TOWN. YOU COME HERE!! NO QUESTIONS ASKED!! BECAUSE WHEN YOU STEP IN HERE YOU WILL BE GREATED WITH LOVE EVERY TIME!!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had the brisket and at Louis ribs.  Both were awesome!  It's nice to find a neighborhood bbq joint.  I'll definitely e coming back when I'm on this side of town again."}
{"text":"There's a nearby place with long lines. I thought that sounded good. I went there. Waited in line near garbage cans and bugs. Was told it would be an hour and a half. Decided to bolt for Texas BBQ House. Went in, was greeted by welcoming people. They told me the other place was all hype and that they would match their brisket against anyone's. They gave me a sample. I was sold. I'm no a fanboy or insider. Ignore the hype. Go to a place that appreciates you---and makes damn good 'cue."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Wish the portions were bigger for the price."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The food here kicks serious ass.  I have been coming here since they opened.  I have tried most of the things on their menu and it all is good.  I might work up the courage to try the poboy someday.  That sandwhich is a beast.  Their brisket is super good. I usually get turkey though since I have to watch cholesterol.  I recommend this place and think you should try it.  Just a reminder there are different style of BBQ here now.  They are all different remember that."}
{"text":"This is the place if you LOVE brisket. They have 3 choices of fat content on your brisket, lean, cutters choice and moist. The cutters choice is in the middle between lean and moist. Look on the board for lunch specials. 

My favorites
$6.99  1/2 LBS of brisket moist
$2.09 small side of Texas cream corn
$1.99 Texas sweet tea

3 slices of white bread
1 Jalapeño
Spicy BBQ sauce

HEAVEN :)"}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for a decade, Texas BBQ House is as close to Texas BBQ that we have found in Arizona. Not a fancy place, however, you go there for the BBQ.  Texas BBQ House will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoenix, and my wife found this place on Yelp since the barbecue place down the street had over an hour wait on a Saturday afternoon. Well, this place was fantastic! It's a hole in the wall, authentic Texas barbecue place with plenty of tables and no wait. You order at the counter and get your food right then, and because we were first timers they gave us free samples of their moist brisket, their specialty. It was dynamite and my wife ordered the brisket and got the hamburger bun to make herself an awesome sandwich.

I got the po boy sandwich, 1/3lb brisket, 1/3lb pulled pork, and 1/3 pound sausage (no bread). It was ridiculous! I liked the sausage, with mustard, but the other two were outta this world. I highly recommend this place.

My wife and shared the sides of cream corn and mac & cheese, both top notch. We couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"The best, had the moist cut, can't wait to try the others"}
{"text":"I got there early so that I'd get sliced brisket, and it was really good. Choice of a lean or fat cut, and generous portions.  Nice condiment bar for pickles, onions, sauces, etc.

Basic dining area, but cool, clean, and comfortable.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Do a better job running and planning your restaurant \"son\". Running out of food two hours before you close either means you have no idea what you are doing, don't give a s#!t about your customers, or you had just an incredibly larger amount of people than you've ever had.

Heard about inventory tracking much \"son\"? Heard about effective management \"son\"? Probably not as your answer to your customers is basically f#@k you.

I certainly won't be back to your dump."}
{"text":"These reviews make me wonder if my palate is off or whether this place is the closest anyone's ever had to southern bbq. 

Unfortunately, I can't say that I was a fan. All the elements for this to have been a home run were there - quaint location, screen patio door, the picnic tables. But, beyond that it just didn't land for me. 

I ordered the lunch special and got the brisket and potato salad. The potato salad was my fault. I was raised to know that you can't trust just anyone's potato salad. But, the brisket...it was way too fatty for me. 

Again, everyone seems to love it. But, if you were born below the Mason-Dixon line, proceed with caution."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped here for lunch about a month ago.  I had the brisket and it was really good.  I liked it so much that I took my wife back a couple of days later to eat again.   I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food- I had the \"cutter's choice cut\" of 1/2lb of beef brisket, very nice smoke ring, good fall apart meat, bbq sauce there are two types, spicy and original both have a good sweet, bold taste. I also had full jalapeno link, not hat spicy, but certain yummy. The sides I had were cream corn and mac n cheese.  Cream corn was great had a little hint of sugar in it made it a little sweet tasting. The mac n cheese was nothing to brag about, the temp of mac n cheese was warm could be hotter. 

Service- The employees are very polite and will let you taste any product if you are not certain between fall off the bone chicken or nice smoked beef brisket. 

Environment- Felt like I was back in a Southern BBQ stop, small, cozy and loved the paper wrap as my plates (keeping it real, bravo)

**My only complaint is this, I have been back a few times and each time they are out of something. Last time it was the sausage links and they couldn't serve beer. Then I went back a month later and still out of sausage and no beer. Then I just went back on 10/15/2012 and they were out of Beef Brisket and Ribs. Come on! That is how you lose business by not keeping your product in stock. I had to go to Rudy's for beef brisket and I did not enough it.***

I will call before I go in again to see what products they are out off."}
{"text":"You seriously have to do yourself a favor and come here at least once a week. Its that good and then some. I just had the basic lunch special with the tri tip and it was beyond good. Im looking forward to trying the other cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Great Brisket and beans. Worth driving from Gilbert. Love the spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I can't wait to move to Phoenix. This place provided me with some of the BEST BBQ I've actually have ever had, and they only had so much on the menu, ran out of food early. I see why lol. I will say i think the Mac N Cheese needs a lot of work, and baked beans on the menu, but man those St. Louis styled ribs, and brisket. Mmmm Mmmm MMMMM!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Get there when it opens to avoid long lines and product run outs. Brisket is out of this world. The banana pudding is amazing."}
{"text":"Prices are getting too high here. Now most meats are up to $9.29 per half pound. The lean brisket wasn't so lean this time, but hey they have hamburger buns now. The Texas twosome are overcharging by at least $2.50 per half pound now and even though it is still good, many more options are out there now for BBQ. Not worth the special trip anymore. Nothing lasts forever."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!! I was recommended to it by my boss for my wedding food and let me just say it did not disappoint! The moment we did the food tasting, we knew this was the wedding food! The day of the wedding went off without a hitch, Mike and his staff were amazing and stayed the entire duration of the wedding to ensure everything went smoothly! All of my guests were raving about the food and how much they loved it! If you're thinking of having a party or wedding and need a caterer look no further, because not only is the food incredible, you really can't beat the price either!! Thank you Mike and Texas Bbq house for helping to make our wedding so amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time here and was happily surprised. The brisket was mouthwatering and the coleslaw was perfect too. Definitely get the banana pudding to finish off! Can't wait to come back next time I'm on the side of town."}
{"text":"The brisket here is fantastic - moist, tender, delicious - and they sell out sometimes so don't delay.  The staff is always friendly and pleasant.  This place is a win!"}
{"text":"I love TX BBQ and always go out of my way to find it. This was my second visit here. The first was with my wife and friends. Nice little restaurant that reminds me of what we would get along the train tracks in the poorer areas of TX.

Menu has your basic items that you would expect at a BBQ joint. The meats are all served by the pound and you can get as much or as little as you want. They also have several side dishes that go great with the Q. The Texas Cream Corn was a treat.

Normally get the Brisket and some Jalapeno Sausage. They have a small area off to the side with onions, pickles, jalapenos and some hot sauces. There are two different house sauces that they make and serve. One is mild and the other hotter.

Food is pretty good but not super great. My Brisket and Sausage seemed to be at room temperature and not very warm. The Sausage was dry and could of had more fat in it. The white bread was not very fresh and tasted like it had been sitting out too long.

Be careful where you sit down. I tried one of the red booths and about killed myself. Apparently the springs are shot and you end up lower than your body was expecting. Play it safe and go with the chair.

Definitely better than a lot of the sweeter styles that are offered around town. Give them a try and see what you think. Located south of the river in an area of town that could use some urban renewal. SMOKIN A-OK!

3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Probably the best I've had in Arizona.  I had the moist smoked brisket and man it was good. The sauces were fantastic and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Wow I was so impressed. My first time here was Friday for lunch. The brisket was the best I ever had. The portion size and quality for the price was the best part. Don't let the outside deter you from walking in. Staff is friendly and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Great BBQ, great service and soda in a nice coke bottle was a beautiful touch. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I so wanted to find a killer BBQ place close to home. After reading my fellow yelpers reviews, we tried the Texas BBQ House. Twice.

Was I being too picky? Am I expecting too much? Why didn't I love this place? The better question is... Why didn't I even like it?

1)  I don't find the flavor of the brisket to be genuinely smoked. Trust me, my neighbor knows how to smoke meats and fish, and his smoked meats blow this place away.

2) The brisket was lukewarm, not hot. Twice. 

2) It wasn't the experience that you say \"OMG, I LOVE this\". It was just okay.

3) Parking is a pain in the ass unless you're coming south on Scottsdale Road and can park in front of the restaurant...there are only a few parking spaces. IF there was fabulous BBQ inside, I wouldn't mind a walk, but there isn't.

4) Yes, the corn is good. I don't go to a BBQ establishment to eat corn. I go to Iowa to eat corn.

5) The beans are average, as is the potato salad. 

6) Their menu is getting smaller (\"sold out\" signs on sausages...already?).

7) They don't sell beer (yet).

Sorry, but I give them 4 months unless things get going on (in a true Texas direction)."}
{"text":"First visit and the food was awesome.  Went with the Texas po boy, they ran out of pulled pork quickly.  I'll get there earlier next time.  The brisket was so most and tasty and the sausage links were great.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The moist brisket melts in your mouth! Make sure you dip it in the spicy sauce!!! True Texas BBQ!"}
{"text":"Anyone comparing this place to Joes needs to have their head examined.  BBQ in the valley Texas BBQ, Pork On a Fork, Haps, The Pits Again, Q to U BBQ, and in that order (all are very good).  Joes is cafateria food with sauce on it.  Sorry east valley folk but you don't even travel out of your neighborhood let alone to other parts of the city.  Texas BBQ stands tall.  They also just added a BBQ tater which is very good as well."}
{"text":"The brisket was alright... Didn't want to wait in the long line at Little Miss BBQ, so I thought I'd give it a try. The meat was pretty tasty, but I was disappointed that they don't cut out the fat layer in the center of the brisket. At LMB, the cut it out and don't include it in weight of meat."}
{"text":"great food, loved the mac & cheese and the ribs.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday with a groupon deal. The inside feels a little cramped when busy. Similar to Rudy's where you order meat by the pound. Not as wide of selection of meats, drinks. I wanted to try a sample of the Jalepeno links but they were out of those. The moist brisket was a bit too moist for my taste and the lean too dry. I tried the cutters choice which was supposed to be in the middle. Instead it was just half lean and half moist. The BBQ sauce was ok, nothing special. I would've preferred a spicy BBQ sauce as well. 

I ordered the beans and potato salad sides. Beans were just ok-- I thought both Rudy's and Joe's Real BBQ were better. Overall, not a bad place considering there is nothing comparable in old town--but I doubt I'd come back unless I had a strong craving for BBQ."}
{"text":"I am not a meat eater but this place was amazing. Got a 1 pound sandwich that had brisket, sausage and pulled pork. Amazing. They had their own spiced BBQ sauce and hot sauce. Would recommend to go hungry and possibly skip a meal after this place."}
{"text":"My husband is a BBQ junkie, me not so much... until now. Loved the brisket, and jalapeño sausage. The mac&cheese and creamed corn are also pretty good. My hubby is also a fan"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ went for the first time today and can't wait to go back!! Briscuit was like prime rib it was that falling apart good! Macaroni and Cheese was yummy and the sweet tea was perfect! Small place but amazing food"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and decided to grab some food before my flight. Decide on this little BBQ joint because it was near and the photos looked good. 

I met with a friendly waitress who took my order at the front counter. It was a great experience. They cut your meat to order. It was quick and easy. My meal was served on a huge serving platter along with pickled onions and jalapeño. 

The ribs had a bit of a unique flavor. It was a dry rub which was cool but the flavor was something I had to get used to. I also order the fatty brisket and man was it good! So moist and flavorful. 

I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat here for my first time. I had read other reviews about the food and decided to try it out. Guess what?!!! The door was locked and a hand written sign was taped to the front door stating they were SOLD OUT. Keep in mind this was a Thursday at 5pm. How can they be sold out. How can a restaurant expect to be successful if they are out of food. I guess I won't go here at all. By the way I went to Rudy's Barbecue in Chandler...the food and service was great."}
{"text":"This place is quick and fantastic. Brisket is tender and very flavorful! Best I've had. 
Jalapeño sausage is awesome! Very friendly and a nice down home joint. Only in town for a couple of weeks, We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Staff, fantastic BBQ.  The Sweet Tea is fresh, and the sides such as the mac and cheese and the creamed corn is almost worth going for... just for that."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had a beef rib , like the one that you see on the opening of the Flinstones! It was huge, but above that it tasted amazing and was super tender! The staff was awesome as well, friendly and very helpful to a first timer. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Parking is hit or miss - small lot, shared with another business. 

Service was cordial. They offered a Yelp special- $3 off order. 

I got the Slider Special (3 pulled pork sliders, 1 small side, and a drink). The side of Mac n Cheese was very cheesy & had a touch of pepper. The sandwiches were very good... Pork came slathered in sauce, so take that for what it's worth. The fountain drink was very watered down. 

Overall, 4 out of 5 stars for efficient service, good pricing, and tasty food."}
{"text":"Couple things I want to get off my chest about this place.

The food itself is probably the best BBQ I've ever eaten to date, and I love BBQ in general. Pulled pork, brisket, and their bbq sauces both sweet and spicy ones are incredible. They deserve the recognition for their A+ flavor in BBQ. 

Now for the part that really annoys me...

- Since I've heard about the place 2 months ago, I've been there 8x (roughly 1x/week) because I work so close and love the food. 4 different times I've asked for their WiFi password, and they refuse to give it to me. I ask because I want to do some personal work on my laptop as I'm enjoying my meal. If they accommodated this, I'd easily go here probably 2x a week because of its location, great food, and it allows me to multitask. Since i spend on average $11 per visit, They're losing roughly $44/month of my business, not including the coworkers and friends I bring in with me because they can't accommodate a simple request, or set up a guest wifi."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed some of their brisket at the BBQ and beer fest. They were the best out of everyone."}
{"text":"To be honest, when we pulled up to this place I had my doubts.  It doesn't look like much on the outside - but I am so glad we stopped here.  This was AMAZING texas style BBQ.  

We arrived about 30 minutes before closing time and were greeted by two really helpful, friendly ladies asking if we've ever been before.  This strikes me as the type of place that has a lot of regulars because the food is SO GOOD. 
     They offered us a sample of the moist brisket (their specialty) and we knew we'd come to the right place! The best brisket I've ever had!  We ordered the po boy sandwich and two sides to share and it was plenty of food for my husband and I and our kiddo.  

I didn't try the sausage - but the pulled pork and brisket were amazing.  The BBQ sauce was tangy and the perfect compliment for both.... though the pulled pork could have been eaten alone because it already was really well seasoned.  The creamed corn and green beans were both great, flavorful and a good size for two people to share.  

Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  We will seek this place out the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"(The continuing story of a yelp-loving couple seeking great locally owned joints, friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere for playing Magic the Gathering...)

NOTE: Do NOT confuse the little tiny kinda scary joint on Broadway and 27th ish street with this place.  They had a BIG sign that said \"Teax BBQ\" so I got confused.  We almost ordered but I just felt like this was NOT the place, so we left and I found it.  SOOOO glad we did!

Ok, so when I asked my husband for his rating of this place...he Stood Up and shot me a 5-Finger Salute.  *lol*  His new FAVORITE BBQ joint.  I must say, as a native Phoenician with no real experience with regional BBQs, I thought the food was top notch.  I just didn't have small kittens like my hubby...  :)

We ordered...
- Moist Beef Brisket (5/5 - yum!  I never knew beef could be so moist and flavorful WITHOUT any BBQ dripping over it!)
- Creamed Corn (DH said it was done right like his Grandma used to do it.  First time I have EVER eaten creamed corn...and liked it.  I will actually order it next time.)
- Mac & Cheese (Just good ole creamy mac & cheese.  Wanted way more...)
- Banana Pudding (VERY homemade.  Big chunks of banana in a creamy yummy pudding with 2 like Nila wafers and a big dollop of whipped cream.  We split and DH thought it was delish)
- Pecan Pie (pretty good as well.  Not life changing but solid)
- Sweet Teas (Diabetic Warning!  This sh_t it SO sweet, *I* did NOT get a refill!  I mean, it was totally yummy...but I started to feel my system balk at the suger overload....which means my southern DH thought it was made just right :P)

The white bread slices straight outta the bag struck me as hilarious but again, DH thought it was even more authentic due to it (and the country music, which he was digging.  Even I tapped a toe along).

The staff was super friendly and the small shop (seats outside as well though) was very comfortable for playing MTG.  They are located in an area some might consider \"Sketchy\" but I bet the building (which looks new or renovated and is lovely btw) was affordable for them!  PS:  Anyone in need of a relaxer or a fade - they are connected to a salon/barber shop which was nice looking and the barber had a line so good sign!

Seriously good eats.  Keep them in business.  I am NOT a big meat eater and I already know my next meal!   MTG Score: DH 3 / Me 0"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get brisket in Arizona and in line quality-wise with the best places I've had in Texas. I do a lot of BBQ and eat a lot of BBQ and these guys clearly know what they're doing. The sausages (both the regular and hot) are great, creamed corn is awesome, and pecan pie is sooooo good. It's easily worth the trip down there. Just make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"This place has the best brisket in town. Love the simple style of the place, focus is on the food. Terrific customer service. The creamed corn is my favorite side!"}
{"text":"They don't worry about making it fancy, they concentrate on making it good. My boyfriend and our 2 friends did a sampler and tried everything. It was all delicious but my favorite was the BBQ Brisket and the BBQ Chop. There sides are delicious too and the banana pudding is D-LICIOUS! =) YUMMY!
The owner (or one of them) was there and was so friendly, helpful and entertaining. Don't let the area or the building scare you... this holds true to the fact that \"the best food comes from mom and pop hole in the walls\". 
The only thing I would change, is they hold back a bit on the spices in there rubs... and the BBQ sauce could be a bit better....
But all in all, great place and one of the best BBQ places in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place has the best brisket of all time! The moist is so juicy and delicious! I just throw some on fresh white bread with some pickles and sauce and I'm good to go. They also have delicious creamed corn and their pulled pork is delicious too! This is the one place that my husband and I can always agree on. You will never go wrong at Texas BBQ House -- just make sure you get there in time (especially on Fridays) cuz their BBQ goes fast!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, great customer service! The food is amazing! Their sliders are so tasty and their lunch specials are a fair price. I really like how it's so clean and the service is fast and simple."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing atmosphere. This is as real as BBQ food gets! Been here a few times and tried the baby back ribs and beef rib, both are amazing. Their Mac n cheese is also delicious. It's a little pricey but it's worth it if you like authentic BBQ."}
{"text":"Smell of oak wood smoke fills Texas BBQ House.  I love the sweet aroma and the nice staff.  This is the friendliest bbq I've been to in Arizona.  While waiting at the counter to order the helpful cashier offers me a piece of beef brisket to help me decide what to get.  It was melt in your mouth tender and full of smoky flavor.  They have 3 different options in the level of moisture/fat in the brisket.  I chose the moist which they were sampling.  The fat rendered down during hours of smoking in their oak pellet filled smoker.  Amazingly moist it's one of the best beef briskets I've had.  Brisket was a deal at $11 for a half pound.

I also tried a $17 beef rib and a half pound of beef brisket for $11.  Beef rib was huge and full of meat.  Very tender beef cooked to medium-medium well.  Loved the flavor from the dry rub and oak smoke. 

Service is really good here.  A couple under 18 kids were keeping the place clean and greeting the guests.  I've never been to Texas but if all the bbq is as good as here I'm gonna have to go."}
{"text":"The more that I visit BBQ joints across the valley, the more I love Texas BBQ House.  The food is always delicious and the staff are quick and helpful.  By this point, I've had most everything on the menu and it's all wonderful.  My favorite BBQ place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've had a chance to eat some of the best BBQ in Texas (Snows's, Louie Muellers, Blacks, etc) and I'm sorry to say that this is not close to any of them. On my first trip I had some of the moist brisket, some ribs and some sausage.  The ribs were okay, but could have used a spicier rub on the meat. Not much smoke on them either. The brisket is so-so. Granted that this is the only place I've found in the valley to serve moist brisket or even give you a choice, but the meat was lacking flavor. It was tender though. The sauce is sweet and lacking a kick either from vinegar or spice, but if the meat is good who cares about the sauce. Sausage was just okay, didn't taste smoke on the sausage at all. I'll try this place one more time, but there are better places in the valley where the BBQ has more flavor from the rub and smoke than Texas BBQ house. I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but was let down
Hopefully the second time I try will be better"}
{"text":"This food is great!!  I would highly recommend the moist beef brisket, BBQ chicken that falls off the bone, coleslaw, and pinto beans!  The owner/chef will let you sample the brisket. After one bite, you will be hooked. Also, you can order a side of the brisket by weight. I did a combination plate of qtr BBQ chicken and 1/2 lb. of beef brisket.  Yes, I was hungry, and I ate every last bit. My co-workers enjoyed their meals, but recommended that you skip the sweet tea, unless you like super sweet tea. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit it does stink prices went up. I had not been here since vefore prices went up by another 3 or 4. I tried the cutters choice brisket. It had a good flavor but kind of dried. Also first time trying a spare ribs. Gotta say im a fan! Love their spicy bbq sauce as always. THE ONE THING I REALIZED THIS TIME AROUND IS THAT THEIR JALAPENOS ARE AMAZING. Always crunchy and spicy. Need to find out what brand they are."}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times now. I arrived at noon on a Thursday and it was 3/4 full. As I left, there were at least twelve in line. Probably for the 'Thursday only' rib tips. 

They were already out of tips by noon, so I got a half pound of moist brisket, a half sausage link plus a drink. 

The owner, Mike, is a Dallas Cowboys fan. I will forgive him for that since he smokes such succulent meats. 

I will be making numerous repeat visits."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this great bbq joint. 2nd visit today & their brisket is awesome! I tried the creamed corn & it may be one if the best things I have ever had. 

The spicy bbq sauce is delish & comes on the side in squeeze bottles. Parking could be tough during lunch hour but worth the trip! Food comes out right away & everyone is quite friendly here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all these good reviews are coming for this place, but I have had way better BBQ than this and the 8 other people with me agreed, we aint goin back. ( with a southern draw of course)   I was very excited to see a BBQ joint in Old town Scottsdale since I am a avid BBQ fan.  I also do a lot of my own meat smoking and love the smells and flavors so I do have some background in it   I was terribly disappointed in this place.  I ordered the 1/2 lb. BBq plate w/ coleslaw and sweet tea   First off, I don't mind the \"pay by pound\" idea in a BBQ joint but I don't like it when BBQ comes drenched in BBQ sauce, and when I mean drenched it was soaked in sauce. I like to put the sauce on myself.  Which leads me to something else I didn't like about this place, the BBQ sauce itself.  WAY to sweet.  To me when  a sauce is to sweet your covering up to much of the meat flavor.  I can put there sauce on a Mc Rib and will taste the same. :) not to knock the famous Mc Rib.
There spicy sauce was actually better but since my meat already came slathered in sweet sauce I couldn't use it.   The potato salad and coleslaw seemed mast produced, in other words they bought it from a supplier, I don't know if this is true but the 8 other people I sat with last sunday all said the same thing.  With my 1/2 lb plate came white  \"FRY\"s\" sandwich bread, no joke.   If you wanted to get an actual bun for BBQ sandwiches it was $.99 extra. 

Again I'm not sure where these good reviews are coming from but if I were you I would stay away and try another BBQ joint, I'm not going to give any suggestions because then people would think I'm an owner of that \"other\"  joint, I'm just going to suggest that there are way better place then here.   Did I mention the Sweet tea was good?"}
{"text":"Best BBQ Spot in South Phoenix! First time here and definitely not the last! They gave us samples of the brisket to try. And damn it was amazing! The brisket is where it's at, it was not tough and you can tell it was made with passion.. 

The BBQ sauce they have reg and spicy both are amazing! The spicy has a kick but it's one where you can't stop eating it! Hubby got the Po Boy and he has no regrets and even though he was full he still kept eating it was so good! 

Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.   Hands down best BBQ in town.  The brisket is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The best brisket in town and you better get there early! They sell out for a reason, it is so darn good, I have now gotten in the habit of going over there before noon buying a pound of moist brisket, sides of slaw, mac n cheese, pecan pie, toss in some bread, some spicy and sweet sauce and I've taken care of lunch and dinner. Winner winner!!"}
{"text":"Are lunch there today. Food was very good and served quickly and the owners young boys were there hustling around cleaning tables, suggesting different sauces and getting drink refills. A bit off the beaten path but worth the stop"}
{"text":"Great wet  brisket. Good sides.  

    Small place.  Could not take clients here but a great place for lunch or a quick dinner near the airport."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I recommend there brisket and if you are especially hungry their Texas Po'boy is excellent!"}
{"text":"I am leaning towards a 2 star rating but am bumping it up because I thought the service was great and the two boys that helped me carry my order to my car.  I really really wanted to like this place.  It is close to home but doesn't accept credit cards.  That always is annoying.  I like that you are offered a sample if you have never been.  I didn't care that much for the sample so I should have known right there.  I ordered 1 pound of lean brisket as my children do not like fat on their food.  I also ordered some st louis style ribs as they were out of beef ribs.  We added on a small container or creamed corn, a large container of macaroni and cheese and a gallon of sweet tea.  The bill was over $40 for a lunch that I had to bring home and dish out for me and 3 kids.  I think that is pretty pricey!

Everything tasted very peppery to me.  We were offered a choice of spicy or regular BBQ sauce.  They came in identical containers.  One had a marking on top which I couldn't see or notice when I got them home to open them.  I had to taste all of them before offering to kids.  The spicy was way to hot.  The regular was good but it killed my stomach trying to figure out which was which with each container.

I didn't care for the choices of bread - sesame hamburger style buns for a plastic bag or white bread slice.  Was hoping for homemade rolls or biscuits.

Brisket was very forgettable.  The ribs were best of the meats and I am not a fan of pork.  

The creamed corn was by far the best part of the meal.  This was the only thing that I actually enjoyed.  Mmmmmm....

The macaroni and cheese was $8 and got thrown away with only what we sampled gone from the top.  Sad because mac & ch is one of my all time favorite foods, same with the kids.  Tons of flakes of black pepper.  Didn't like anything about it.

The sweet tea was a hit with the children since I never let them have caffeine but it was sweet and not refreshing to me.  I am more a fan of unsweet though so that could likely just be my personal opinion.

I wish the restaurant much success but these neighbors won't be back.  :("}
{"text":"Never been till today and the place has a sandwich called Poor Boy. Large
 and just wonderfully. Sausage, pulled pork and Brisket  pile thick and smoked. Great BBQ place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time (and put my Yelp dollars to work). It's a very small, cozy place in South Phoenix, light on furnishings, but big on flavor and service. I told them it was my first visit and they proceeded to let me sample sides and meat cuts at the counter. Great service!  Packaged up some pulled pork, brisket, and creamy corn to go and headed home. Really good flavor, though brisket was a tad fatty. Still, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Texas BBQ catered our office lunch today. Outstanding! We've used the other BBQ place in the past and it does not compare to this place.
I'll be sending them a thank you note tomorrow. Best BBQ and sides in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for the most awesome of the most awesome brisket and have found another high contender today. I was in the area and decided to stop by. The brisket was wonderful!! Melt in your mouth wonderful! Service with a smile. Great job :)"}
{"text":"OH NO! THEY CLOSED IT! :(
Best BBQ in Phoenix! We just moved from TX and we were bummed that there was no good BBQ around until we found this place! The meat is just great, even without the sauce but if you like BBQ sauce then you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best BBQ I've had outside of KC. It's a hidden gem in south Phoenix that seems to lack on culinary finds ... but no worry, because Texas BBQ will not disappoint. The people here are very friendly and helpful with the menu and will give samples of their BBQ too, if you're on the fence as to what to order. Mike takes a lot of pride in his talent of BBQ and smoked meats and it shows heads and tails above other places in the valley. They chop and slice right in front of you as all of their meats are smoked on site and you can smell that smoky deliciousness! The side dishes are all good : Mac & Cheese; Potato Salad ; Cole Slaw ... And the sauces: I like that they aren't put strait on to the meats and there are options ... lots of options ! If you want sandwiches or sliders , Texas BBQ has those. The Texas Po Boy is filled with 1 lb!!!! of meat : pulled pork, brisket and a link sausage !! You will be full! I love that the place is clean and although it's always busy, as most great places are, they are efficient and friendly ! They have the option of ordering online ... I wish they were open past 7pm, as some nights my husband and I have got home and said , 'mmmm wouldn't Texas BBQ be good...?' and it's closed :-( But , it's a family run business and I get the need for time off... so plan ahead ! Get in here ... this BBQ is a surprise for being in Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"You guys win , best barbecue joint ever! I think my guy back homes going to know I cheated on him and that I found a new joint. Where do I start everything is good. That's it plain and simple. The chef stands there and talks to you While he cuts it up. The brisket and ribs r world-class. So glad I found this place"}
{"text":"The barbecue is good, just not the best ever.  

There usually is no lines and it's very quick to get food!  I come here when I need to eat quick and want barbecue."}
{"text":"4 stars on the brisket, not so much on the pork, and not on the bread pudding, but Texas = Beef, so OK."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I've ever had. They don't have freezers so you know everything is fresh and made that day.  Every meat I've order here is juicy and foul of flavor and the sides are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Was told this place was almost as good as Little Miss bbq but without the hour long wait. I was lied to. It was a solid bbq place, but probably wouldn't go back. I was very put off by the fact that you are just given some slabs of meat on tissue paper. Not even a plate! If you wanted bread you were given some slices of generic white store bought bread. No thanks! The meat was good. There didn't seem to be much selection though. We all had a side of Mac and that was also fine. Shared a pecan pie slice and that was very good! The wait staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was cute. I just can't stop the comparison and feeling like I missed out. My whole family agreed."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had.  I've had the pulled pork, moist brisket, sausage, and chopped brisket, and they are all amazing.  Their sauces are perfect for each of their meats, and the cream corn is amazing - also probably the best I've ever had.  I work at the airport, and although the surrounding area isn't all that great, I'm thankful for the convenience of the location."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ joints in Arizona! The beef briskett can be ordered three ways (Lean, Regular, or Cutter's Choice) Sides are great and find the hot BBQ Sauce in the red bottles. Order by the pound to feed the whole family and enjoy all the local sports figure autographed photo's that adorn the walls. Fresh cut red onions, peppers and pickles await your indulgence as you carry your prized meal to the outdoor dining facing South Mountain. 

Owner is usally there helping ensure quality is constant. They support many local charities as well and are a great asset to the community. Togo and catering available to really impress the guests."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try take out for my husband's birthday celebration we were hosting. Having noticed on previous reviews that they sometimes run out of brisket, I called at 10am when they opened to put in my order of moist brisket. Very glad I did because another man arrived at 4:30pm as I was picking up our brisket and was told they had run out fairly early that day. Poor old man had driven 30 minutes just to have the brisket and the rest of us had already vultured the stock. I felt bad, but not bad enough to share. The moist brisket was AMAZING. Like jaw dropping amazing. We never thought we'd have anything that rivaled Franklin's BBQ in Austin, Texas but this place might just do it. They were sold out of Jalapeno Sausage too, which other reviews suggested was good. I can't speak to that, but the creamed corn and macaroni were good. The creamed corn was somewhat unique so I'd probably go with that over the mac n cheese, but really you should skip sides altogether and just order more brisket. I might try one of the leaner cuts one day, but I also might not because the moist brisket totally knocked my socks off. Yum.

As for the old man, I think he ordered some pulled pork instead and seemed pretty happy with how that tasted as well so all is not lost if you show up late to the party."}
{"text":"I'm a big time fan of another BBQ joint that has received National recognition in Phoenix but the Texas BBQ House surprised the heck out of me and 2 others with their Awesome Burnt Ends.  This is definitely a diamond in the rough and I will be back.  Besides the meat choices, the cream corn is a must have."}
{"text":"I rarely review anything on yelp... but this place deserves it. I've been living in Phoenix for over two years now and have been in constant search of a great ribs place.  This is THE BEST ribs in town, in the valley, in AZ period.  I was so incredibly impressed I sat in the restuarant with a huge smile on my face. AZ is finally starting to feel like home when you find a stellar place like this.  If you are visiting and want BBQ, go here and only here. Don't waste your time or money anywhere else.

I ended up have the St Louis Ribs... absolutely killer. A huge slab of ribs. Either BBQ sauce compliments them perfectly. The rub is so incredible that you don't even need the bbq sauce. Seriously so good.

After the ribs I sampled the brisket and the turkey.  I felt like I was Guy Fieri on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I couldn't give the own enough compliments on the food. I was floored at how good everything was. 

I also sampled the texas corn and the mac and cheese. 10/10 winners. I couldn't believe that everything I ate there was that damn good.  This place is batting 1.000. They hit it out of the park on every dish I had.  I can't say enough good things. 

Keep in mind this place is in the ghetto and is a bit of a dive. But in the persuit of excellent food, that should not deter you one bit. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to get back to this place since I moved to Mesa. I tried to go back on my last birthday but they were closed for a week 'cause they were on vacation. Probably back in Texas. This place hands down has THE best brisket I've had since leaving Texas. If I remember correctly the guy is from Corpus Christi. Even their sauce is great but this isn't some Chicago-style BBQ joint, the meat and the dry rub is all you need. That, a DrPepper, a grape soda, real southern sweet tea, or Big Red (which I forgot even existed). Texas Cream Corn, Banana Pudding, Pecan Pie, it's all there. Authentic to the core. Only things missing are fried okra (I'm from east Texas) and 'Blue Bell homemade ice cream' but I'm sure you could bring your own if you were so inclined but leave that Ben & Jerry's stuff back on the shelves where it belongs."}
{"text":"Texans do things a little differently. They pledge allegiance to the Texas flag in school. They maintained the right to secede from the Union. Their flag flies at the same height as the US flag....and they make insanely killer BBQ. This is a little taste of Texas right here in AZ. As a former San Antonian - I know BBQ! Don't let the location deter you - once you step inside those doors you're transported to the Lone Star state. 

The food was delicious. We tried the pork ribs, the moist brisket, and the sausage. All amazing - their meat is cooked to perfection. Next time I need to save room for the pecan pie. They serve the meat with slices of white bread and there are pickles and onions on the side - that's how they do it in Texas :) . 

The service was incredible - these guys are great. They are wiling to accommodate their customers however they can. They are going to have all the NFL games this season - they have several t.v.'s. This is a perfect place to grab lunch and catch a game. 

I really hope all my fellow downtowners will take the time to drive a few miles south and support this business. The food is great and affordable - one of the least expensive BBQ places I've been too. Go and eat some great food and enjoy some Texas hospitality. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Really good bbq.  The moist brisket is excellent, the food is affordable, and it's got a couple of comfortable tables and booths in an air conditioned area.  Little Miss BBQ is about 2 miles away, and is better bbq, but Texas BBQ House has faster service and more comfortable dining area."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Paid $9 for 1/2lb ribs, no drink or sides included."}
{"text":"Whatever the one pound BBQ sandwich was, was amazing! Sides were good, I would like to return and try a few more items."}
{"text":"Friendly owner. Great food. Kinda pricey but worth it. I wish they were open longer and didn't close early when the run out of meat."}
{"text":"Food is great. The staff is terrific. Kind of small dinning area and some limited parking but worth it. Texas Poorboy is a definite rerun. This place has BBQ down. Cream corn is very addictive."}
{"text":"I had the moist (fatty) brisket and thought I had died and gone to Texas. Also had a few slices of sausage as a taster, that were excellent.

Although I'd like to try everything on the menu, I am sure I won't be able to resist the call of the brisket."}
{"text":"Came here because of the rating.  Food was average in taste and quality and pricey to boot.  Atmosphere is very basic at best...kind of like a run down college diner.   On the plus side, food was served almost instantly and the bbq sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the closet thing to Texas bbq you'll get in Arizona, actually it's the real deal. It has the perfect amount of smoke, and everything was so tender. I got the rib special, which come with 4 ribs, a drink, and one side, I got the mac and cheese. The ribs were falling off the bone. Texas bbq is a big fan of just seasoning the ribs with salt and pepper, and you can definitely taste it there. I am more of a sweet rib guy, but I still liked it. I also got the most brisket, which was to die for. It had that perfect bark on it, and it melted in your mouth. Then there was the mac and cheese, which has to be some of the best I have ever had. It has creamy, and some added pepper. I don't like it when the cheese is to thick. This place was really amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the price, I know smoked bbq can get pricey, but I think it was a little to expensive."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ House is located across from RnR towards the southern end of Old Town where Billet Bar (and something else in between) was originally located.  Parking is plentiful on the street, but I'd be careful of parking in the lot next door.  There's big signs that say \"Bucca di beppo will demolish your car if you park it in this lot\".

Walking towards the restaurant, the outdoor patio is quite small with the ability to sit maybe 24.  There's only 2 umbrellas so watch out for the Scottsdale sun.  The inside definitely had a BBQ house feel to it.   Imagine a really clean Famous Daves.  What I really liked was the front of the restaurant was completely opened to the outdoors.  It let a lot of light and sun shine in.

The service was really good.  The employees knowledgeable and helpful on different cuts.  They also didn't scoff at my 12 different questions about the BBQ meats they served.

There's free samples of any BBQ you want.  They are sold by the 1/2 lb or any weight you want.  I got the brisket cutters style, cream of corn, and some sweet tea.  They give you a couple slices of white bread to go along with the meal.

The sweet tea was probably not helpful to my dental checkup next week, but you kind of have to drink some at a BBQ joint.

The cream of corn was delicious.  It was sweet, creamy, but a tad too rich.

For the main event, the brisket comes in three different styles: no fat, more fat, and \"i'm fat by choice\" cuts.  I ordered the more fat cutters style.  It was a little dryer than I wanted it, but it had a great taste to it.  I wish there was more smoke to it.

On the downside, there were only 2 BBQ sauces available: spicy and mild.  They both tasted the same to me.  I like it when a place has a dozen different sauces to try out.  The BBQ style is also dry rub which probably led to it being a little dry.

Overall, it's a nice place and something Old Town has been needing for a while.  The food didn't blow me away, but if you're craving some BBQ and in the area, then I think you can't go wrong with Texas BBQ House."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some take out after playing golf at The Legacy which is just around the corner.  First visit and was very impressed.  The service was quick and friendly.  They slice up the Q right there at the counter, weigh your portion and wrap it to go or serve it up on butcher paper.  I chose the \"moist\" brisket, regular sausage and St Louis style ribs.  The brisket was very tender and juicy, some of the best I have had anywhere.  The sausage was also very good.  The ribs were \"fall off the bone\" tender.  The guys included some of their home made BBQ sauce and it was excellent with everything.  This place is definitely not fancy and located South of the Airport, but the food was AAA+++ and I will definitely go back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by this BBQ spot on a whim with my boss and I am so glad we did. The food and customer service were awesome. We came in at 7pm not realizing that they were about to close, they accomdated us despite it being after their closing time. 
The pulled pork sliders are rather large. The mac & cheese and cream corn are awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place after it being open for months and being just down the street. 
The people are actually from Texas! And have really good barbeque. Some of the meat seems a little high but totally worth it.  Just means I wont be able to eat here as often as probably would like.  The sauce is on the sweeter side, then has a kick...and the pecan pie is homemade and isn't a true southern recipe but is really good too.
If you are in the mood for great barbeque, try this place. Better than Rush's!"}
{"text":"This is not the worst or best BBQ place I have been to, so I'm rating this place a middle of the road ranking of 3 stars. I had the special with one side and a drink for about $10 which consisted of the sliced brisket and beans. I'm debating whether or not to copy and paste Daren C.'s review from 10/20/11 underneath this paragraph because I pretty much had the same experience and opinion that he had.

The serving of this meal in a carton was a real turn off to me. Basically requiring the customer to take the butcher paper out and spread it out on a table and then take all of the items out of the carton and transfer stuff to the butcher paper. Then get up and dispose of the bulky carton. In short, too much paperwork to do for a guy out on his lunch break.

The brisket was uninspiring and the beans were awful."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing and is offered at a price you should expect to pay for BBQ. First clue this place was going to be amazing is it was packed with cops and detectives. Ordering is a bit confusing and their menu is not the easiest to understand which is why I only gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Texas PoBoy is best far the greatest thing ever made! Best BBQ in AZ hands down! Do yourself a favor and go ASAP"}
{"text":"Great bbq, the service is excellent and helpful! My brisket was moist and was cut to my liking w just a tad bit of fat. The sausage was excellent just disappointed they didn't have spicy jalapeño the last 2 times I've been there which I prefer over regular sausage but I've enjoyed the regular had plenty of flavor. I lived in Texas and ate my share of bbq and this is the real deal. They have two sauces hot and mlld, slices of bread are available upon request plus they have the pickles, onions, peppers are available as well. The sides are just sides nothing real special but their beans are the best in my opinion. All served in a tray on butcher paper just like in Texas! The last time i was there it was cash only so just be prepared. The neighborhood is a little sketchy but the bbq is for real! Don't Judge it by its cover.. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves bbq and lives around Phoenix go check it out!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus. All of my prayers have been answered. I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the 
\"best bbq\" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence. 

As I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years. 

Highlights of the meal:

Brisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crust
Ribs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavor
Sauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerina
Coleslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummy
Potato salad-  Oh how I love thee

I will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door."}
{"text":"Being a Texan (it's a whole 'nother country) I am always on the lookout for places which do REAL Texas BBQ the right way.  This place is one of the few.

Funny Story:  the first time I brought some meat home from here, my son smelled the bag and said, \"Smells like the Family Reunion up in here.\"  We always have brisket at our annual family reunion back in Texas, so when he smells brisket, he always thinks of that.....:)

I had made two trips here to get a variety of meats and sides, and they have ( for the most part ) all been big hits with me and the kiddos.

Lean brisket - can be a little dry-ish, but that's what you get when you lose the fat.
Moist brisket - really moist, and excellent smoky flavor.
Pork Loin - my son raved about it, called it the best pork he ever tried.
Jalapeño Sausage link - nice flavor, but not hot enough for me.
BBQ Chicken - nothing special - a weak point in the meats
Chopped Beef - also known as chipped beef, and the sauce is a little overpowering and too salty.
Red Beans - a little meat in there, and other flavors - VERY GOOD.
Potato Salad - nothing memorable about it, but it was \"good\"
Ribs - good flavor, but not tender enough for my tastes.  I like them falling off the bone.
Banana Pudding - was GREAT one time, and was GROSS another time - WTH?

It will run about $12 per person to get a good \"two servings each\" batch of meats, so that is pretty reasonable for the quality of meat you get.

And lucky for me, they are only a couple of miles from home.  I have found my Go-To Texas BBQ place."}
{"text":"At least for this one visit, the Scottsdale location was slightly disappointing compared to the original location in a couple of ways:

1.  The prices are slightly higher.  I understand that of course the cost of running an Old Town establishment is higher than running one in some other parts of town.  But It's a little off-putting to use the company website for pricing out an order, then finding out when you get there that the prices on the website reflect prices at the OTHER LOCATION, not THIS location.  Not a huge deal, but it cost me an extra $8 overall.

2.  The \"lean\" brisket was very dry.  Normally, at the original location, the lean brisket was mostly free of fat but had a little moisture to it to save the day.  The batch I got on 5-23-2012 was REALLY dry.  Edible when drenched with the spicy BBQ sauce, but unacceptably dry.

So I guess I'll stick with the original location."}
{"text":"*A desert landscape at midnight. A few men gather around a campfire seeking its warmth and the rare company of a passing stranger. One man, equally ravaged by the sands of time and the desolate landscape began to speak with just the smallest glimmer of contentment in his voice.*

I had heard for years the ever-so-tantalizing cry of \"melt-in-your-mouth brisket\" sung to me by oh so many men who had come before....men far more accomplished than I. I remember them telling me as a young boy, \"Son, some day you will find your brisket.\" I stared up at them with a gleam in my eyes. An innocent and naive sense of hopefulness filled me to the brink and then poured over the edges of my soul as I thought to myself, \"Yes! I will find my brisket.\"

Many years have come and gone since that time. The months like an ever strengthening gale storm pushing me further and further from my deepest, darkest desire: to find my lost brisket. Lo, the days were long; the minutes past like decades. 

Soon my cynicism began to take the best of me. A crusade of the mind against the heart ensued as brisket after brisket entered my gullet and filled my disposition with neglect. Some were flavorful, sure. But none would fulfill the promise my elders had made to me as a young boy.

None, that was, until I found the Texas BBQ House of south central Phoenix. I knew the moment I walked through their doors that I was in for something special, but just what, I could not have told you. I watched a man behind the counter wield his blade flawlessly as a woman kindly prepared a basket with bread and cheesy macaroni. She had potato salad and and sausage and all sorts of other wondrous items. And then the brisket was placed before me. I could see the tenderness of the meat as its juices glistened in the daylight. I saw burnt ends that I could swear were calling for me by name. I thought, \"Could it be? Have all my dreams come true?!\" My heart went aflutter with the still unfulfilled promise of my forefathers.

Finally, the moment had arrived. I prepared a slice of bread with a few slivers of meat, and a helping of barbeque sauce. I slowly bit down as my eyes closed, hoping and preying that the day had finally come. It was like I had died and gone to heaven. I saw Jim Morrison. I went towards the light. Only...when I walked through it, there I was. Sitting at my table, across from my father, with some brisket in a slice of bread that now had a single bite taken from it. I was happy. Down to my core, I was filled with contentment. And I realized at that moment, that I hadn't been searching for that \"melt-in-your-mouth\" brisket all along...I had been searching for myself. And now, I had found it. I had found...me.

*hold for applause*

This is the Q I have been waiting for!!!! Awesome brisket, both the lean and juicy are fantastic. The sausage was the next big winner, followed by the potato salad and then the mac, but actually everything was fantastic. The hot bbq sauce has quite a kick to it, but its a whole-mouth warmth kind of thing so its quite pleasant. Without a doubt the best bbq I've had to date, and I will be back."}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to another restaurant in Scottsdale for lunch when we passed by this place.  We walked past it intent on our destination of choice when we we were no longer able to continue, succumbed by the intoxicating smell of smoked meat.  We pulled a quick 180 and ditched our plans in a quest to match a taste to the delicious aromas that were floating around Old Town.  THIS PLACE IS LEGIT.  We ordered the smoked links, smoked turkey, choice brisket, and the fattier cut of brisket (they have 3 choices of cuts for brisket) along with a medium side of creamed corn.  The owner and girls at the counter were throwing samples at us left and right.  Overall we were extremely satisfied, and we almost forgot to bring the promised food back for a coworker we were so preoccupied with stuffing our faces.  As if we had not had our fill we ended the midday feast with Banana Pudding which I have to say was quite awesome as well.  

I will go back there tomorrow, eat, and then take a nap on their hickory logs."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best barbecue I've found in Phoenix.  I've lived in South Carolina, Memphis, and Texas so I like to think I know a little bit about what makes good barbecue.  Their brisket is very good and has a nice smoke ring.  A little over peppered that last time I was there.  The biggest surprise was their take on pulled pork.  It was actually quite good.  It had a bit of jalapeño mixed in with the sauce that really worked well."}
{"text":"AWESOME BBQ. You can get brisket however you like, with fat, some fat or no fat. Laughing at the review below in which someone asked for fat and then complained about fat HA! The marble on their brisket is a work of art! I have not had a bad meal here and everyone I have taken wants to go back. They have great spicy BBQ sauce too.  I have to say, out of all the BBQ stops in the valley, this one is the best there is.

I took a few guys from work here Friday. They have a new Poboy sammich which is brisket, pulled pork and sausage. Damn heart attack on a bun but YES it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This little Texas smoked  Bbq spot is awesome and has the best spicy sauce so far. I ordered 2 chicken halves here and spent about $15 and they were delicious with the sauce. Hours are limited to lunch times so you need to get there befor 3pm. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I have grown up on BBQ. I have always enjoyed finding excellent BBQ, and Texas BBQ House qualifies. I looked all over the valley and when I visited this place, I found my BBQ spot. Friendly staff, not a long wait, and just an overall great experience. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This joint is for real.  Food is hard to find on the way to Phoenix from LA, but once you get there, this place will NOT disappoint! So save your appetite!  I warn you, the butcher is super hot.  He'll let you try meat if you ask nicely, but I just tell them to make it nice with a few options to share with friends.  nothing is bad here.  wax paper is your plate and the sauce is so good I bought TWO bottles to bring home.  i'm gonna say it...their sauce might rival Ohio's Montgomery Inn's which is ALSO in my fridge!"}
{"text":"WOW. Seriousky just had the brisket and ir is Amazing . .We wilk be regulars."}
{"text":"We bought a \"living social\" coupon thing for this place.  We're always up for trying new BBQ!  We got the brisket with the coupon, plus got some sausage links and pulled pork.  Plus the sweet tea.

The tea was very good (though my wife thought it was too sweet...it was just the way I like it).  The brisket, while it had a nice smoke ring, had very little smokey flavor.  And basically no seasoning.  The sausage link was \"just a sausage\".  No smokiness, nothing special.  The pulled pork was drowned in sauce, so I can't say if it was smokey or not.  The flavor of the pork was OK.  Not great.  Just OK.

Two stars is \"I've experienced better\".  And I have.  Dave's BBQ is better.  Rudy's is much better.  And Joe's is vastly better.  Texas BBQ House is not bad, but it's not particularly good either.  I've certainly had worse BBQ, but there is much better available.  So why go here (unless it's just that it's convenient to where you are)?"}
{"text":"Came in to play some golf, started the trip off right.  Awesome ribs, brisket, poboys and sides.  We got a bunch to share so we could taste different options and I think that is the way to go.  It's all good."}
{"text":"Yummy brisket and ribs.  The cream corn is good and potato salad too. Also, good sauces.  Sausage wasn't my taste.
Very salty, so it is definitely not good for those watching sodium."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq in phoenix! omg. I am a fan of any place that serves meat by the lb and uses a beverage crate as a plate. I ordered the pork spare ribs (I asked for a full pound and didn't need it), the rub was spicy and the meat was moist and just about fell off the bone. We also had the mac and cheese, homemade and perfect. My husband ordered the Texas Po Boy sandwich, a full pound of meat. Smoked sausage, brisket and pulled pork it was so flavorful. He also ordered the green beans, I didn't try them but he said they were very tasty. The staff was very friendly. The chef (maybe owner) gave us a sample of brisket. We got there before 7 (closing time) but no one rushed us and the waitress even stood and chatted with us for a bit. When we are on this side of the valley again we will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Wow this place knows what they're doing.  Everything was great, especially the Poboy sandwich!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, chicken, and pork! Hands down the BEST BBQ in Phoenix! Everything is well prepared and filling! Best go with an appetite and best get there early because they can sell out of things really fast. I'm normally not a big fan of creamed corn, but these guys have converted me and I'm hooked! Definitely will be back for more! Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"When you walk in you are greeted by an incredibly friendly staff. They ask you if you have dined with them before and when you say \"no\" they give you a slab of brisket. It's the best brisket of my life. So moist. So delicious.

You must go here! It's fast, friendly, and delicious. I'm so happy we were able to stop here on our business trip. Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and it's obvious that this place is popular. Parking lot is usually jammed around lunch. There is a reason for this... BECAUSE THE BARBEQUE IS DELICIOUS.

I had a BBQ brisket sandwich lunch meal last time, and 3 pulled pork sliders this time. Both times I got the macaroni and cheese, and a drink. The food is ridiculously good.

It can be pricey, but worth it. There is a $3 off coupon on Yelp, so that's cool if money is tight.

My only \"beef\" (pun intended) is the tacky use of 2 liter drink carriers instead of trays. How expensive can trays be?"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the valley and well worth the drive to get there.  Their sampler pack is out of this world.  Give you a chance to try it all.  Absolutely fabulous!  BBQ sauces are out of this world."}
{"text":"We got to this place late, so we had to chose from a short list of what they had left. I had some of their spare ribs and the smoked sausage. Both were really good. My wife had the pulled pork sliders. They were also really good. The cream corn was excellent . Next time, I will,get there earlier, because I really want to try the brisket. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best brisket we ever had. Ordered the platter and everything was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing and friendly staff, truly about the food. For my first time they made sure I got to sample the brisket to make my best choice. Meats are cooked perfectly with perfect marbling and incredible amount of care. Plenty of food with every meal. Owner was present and really proud of his food, made sure we enjoyed our meal. Came around with samples of some new food to try. Really enjoyed this slice of Texas in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The moist brisket was amazing, just fatty enough that it melts in your mouth and the flavor is better than most brisket that I've had. The Texas creamed corn was so good I could eat a tub of it. I wish I didn't live all the way in Los Angeles, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it was awesome! I understand what the hype is about. I've had some good BBQ, but this takes the cake. Nice smoky flavor with the lean brisket and it was soooo tender.  The sausage tastes like it is made fresh and the pulled pork was tasty, but a little tough. We had the potato salad and banana pudding and both were pretty good, but the banana pudding would have been better with a layer or at least more of the vanilla wafers. 
The only bad thing was that they seem to run out of food quickly (This is why I gave it four stars). We tried to pick up some food yesterday and they were completely out of everything. This was at least an hour before they closed. I really wanted some ribs, but today they didn't have any. However, I understand why they do run out. Next time I will call in my order nice and early to make sure I get to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Call me Frank Underwood because I just found my version of Freddie's BBQ Joint (for all of you who watch House Of Cards).   I came here on a whim after seeing the reviews for this place and boy were they correct. This place is what BBQ is supposed to be. The meat is flavorful and moist. You can taste the smokiness and the flavor from the love they put into their meat. 

The way they serve the food is also pretty cool! The sides are spectacular and the sauce is flavorful. The staff here is also very helpful and you can tell they take pride in their food. The actual place is non description and is exactly how a BBQ joint should be. 

I loved this place so much I got two servings! Well worth it! If you want BBQ this place will not disappoint. :)"}
{"text":"I have a new go-to! This is bbq done right!

My first visit here I got some chopped beef, lean sliced brisket, a link of sausage, cole slaw and a slice of pecan pie.

The chopped beef made a delicious sandwich (for the record, a 1/2 lb of chopped beef makes 2 hefty sandwiches for less $ than most bbq joints charge for 1) but the star here was the lean brisket. Might be too dry for some but I prefer mine super lean cuz you can always add some sauce to it. They do have moist brisket as well.

The sausage was tasty too and I can't wait to see what the jalapeno version is doing.

Top notch quality and for a price that isn't gonna hurt your wallet. Proof that a lot of valley bbq restaurants are charging too much.

To put it plain and simple, THIS BBQ IS LARAPIN!

Oh yeah, cash only."}
{"text":"Pluses? You can get in, order, and get out of there reasonably quickly. If you're looking to be seated and inside, there's more of chance for you to find a spot, also. But that's about it. If you can wait a bit, and/or planning on takeout...just do yourself a favor. Drive a half-mile north to Broadway, and turn west. Just before the light on 16th St. is JL Smokehouse on the north side of the road. You can review it here on Yelp, also."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!! Had the brisket and sausage link, it was outstanding! Best BBQ I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love to have BBQ in different states when I'm traveling and ran across this place through yelp. The outside appearance is what I would expect for a fantastic BBQ joint... nothing fancy as I pulled into the parking lot.

I walked in to be greeted by a friendly pit master, awesome waitress, a couple of friendly locals and a great Texas menu.

Three meat poor boy on the special board, but a free taste of the moist brisket sealed the deal. Juicy with a nice subtle rub flavor with some mild smoke. I settled on the 1/2lb of Brisket, 1/2 Rack of St. Louis Ribs, Cole Slaw, sweet tea and Texas Dirt Pudding.

The brisket was awesome, juicy and tender with a hint of seasoning. The Ribs were the best St Louis ribs I have had yet. The coleslaw was so fresh and had the perfect flavor and sweetness, as good as it gets and I can only think of one other place in Georgia that came close.I tired the house BBQ sauce (i'll try the spicy next time) and absolutely loved it. The sweet tea was great and three huge glasses.

I asked myself if I should get up and order more??? but the dirt pudding looked like the end of me and hoped that after a excellent meal it would not disappoint. We'll that was almost better than the rest of the meal if the BBQ wasn't so good and in most places it would have been.

Thanks to the friendly owner this place is on my A list when In Phoenix from now on!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here by accident and glad we did. One of the best BBQ experiences ever! \"Moist brisket\" was killer and never had anything that good. Jalapeño sausage and ribs were excellent!"}
{"text":"Greatest barbecue on the planet and great service highly recommend it. I come here once a week"}
{"text":"Ok so this place...if you blink you miss it cause it's in the corner like a little secret. However we discovered it and let me tel you, this place has the best BBQ food I have had in my life. Their staff is great! The food to die for. Their Cream Corn OMG they ALWAYS run out and I can always only get a pint which to be honest is never enough, I always want more. Their Sausage, Turkey, Ribs Beef or Pork, their pulled Pork...All delish! We always go for their best item which is the BRISKET. OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it! This is a MUST try place, believe me you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Granted it was my first visit but I don't get down that way often, but i was underwhelmed. 

The building looked good from outside but it sort of went down hill after that. The deli style, by the lb, served in cartons, butcher paper, cash only, one sauce thing was overload...negativly. 

I ordered the \"cutters choice\" brisket, side and drink for 7.99.  I was given a 3.5 cuts of dry brisket on was paper, a small side of beans in a styo cup with a lid, a plate which is another section of wax paper all folded, two slices of WALMART white bread, on wax paper served in a huge 2 liter pepsi container used to carry 10 or more bottle at a time with more wax paper under it all. 

The drink was a styro cup, with an individually wrapped straw, individually wrapped fork, knife and spoon and more styro cups or paper trays for the pickles, onions and peppers. 

The entire thing was a freakin mess. I had more trash to throw away the a family of four in a normal place. Yet they only take cash because they want to keep costs down...WHAT?

The brisket was ok, the sauce was ok (one type yet there are buckets under the cooler of beer that say HOT SAUCE on them?) The beans were ok. Really nothing to bring me back which sucks because they are better then my review and I know it."}
{"text":"Dropped by again this past saturday and again was VERY satisfied! They also serve a pulled pork now and it is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing meats. They let you try anything before you buy and they explain the different types of cuts of the meats. This is nice becuase I have no idea what different cuts means but I could try everything and then decide which one I liked the best. Their home made desserts are very delicous also so is the creamy corn."}
{"text":"Ill start this out by sounding terribly biased, and just get it out of the way. I am one of their original staff members, from years ago. And while I was only there a year (and have been gone several now) I still am a fan, and keep in touch with the guys. At one point in my life, I was a vegetarian (gasp). How I ended up working at a bbq joint, God only knows. But I did, and yes I ate the food ALL the time. I personally prefer to get the turkey, and the jalapeno sausage. I don't eat ribs, never tried them, so I cant comment on them. The cream corn was my favorite side, although the beans are suuuuuuper yummy as well. If you try a dessert, the banana pudding is the way to go. You'll want more than one cup of it! Dale and Mike have been there since day one, and I respect them as owners, and how they interact with their customers. One day many months ago I ended up out west, when the Rudys in Goodyear opened. Although I felt like I was cheating, I needed to compare. That being said, although Rudy's is a more known facility, and larger, it just wasn't the same. I still prefer Texas BBQ House. The hospitality and pricing are better, and they are smack in the middle of the valley. To the people complaining about them running out of items, these meats take hours and hours to prepare, I would suggest calling ahead if its that big of a deal. If you haven't been to this place, its well worth the visit. And yes, you'll be in Cowboys Country :)"}
{"text":"First visit was pretty good.

*Update - my last 30 visits have been great!!!

Once you get past the look of the parking lot, it's all good.

*Update - new parking lot looks great!!

I got the $10.99 lunch special, pulled pork with a bun, side of mac & cheese and a drink.

Not a bad deal and was filling!! Nice people, basic laid back atmosphere, but clean.

The bun was fresh, the pork tasted great and was cooked and was not fatty, mac & cheese was pretty good, came lots of black pepper in it :), soda was mixed well and tasted good, clean soda machine and amenities table.

I normally would never do a comparison, but since my disappointment at the nearest BBQ shop............... 
Texas BBQ House is very good food at a fair price --VS-- The Barbecue Company (a mile away), is grossly overpriced and the food was not so good. (see my review).. I had the same basic meal at each location, the quality definitely goes to the Texas BBQ House, and at 2/3 of the price.........

This is my new go to lunch at my new job. Feeling blessed to have a great place so close...

Give this place a try for sure if you like good BBQ. The guys at the next table were going crazy over the brisket and sausage...."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meat I have ever had!

The moist brisket is like eating heaven.  I usually over estimate a food when someone tells me it is good and it never ends up meeting my expectations.  This was built up so much that there was no way it was going to be that go, i mean it is just BBQ, right?  Wrong!  This was like eating a new food that I have never had before.  Seriously, you can not understand the tastes that you will experience until you do it yourself.  And if you think you have had it before, you have not :' ) soooo goood."}
{"text":"Thank you Texas BBQ House for ANOTHER great meal!  I served 16 of my clients your BBQ for lunch and they went back 2 and 3 times!! Wasn't much left over!  I appreciate you ample portions and all the sides..even a couple gallons of tea! 

Absolutely the BEST BBQ IN TOWN and well worth the 25 minute drive to get there.

Definately my first choice when pleasing my clients, friends and family with an awesome meal!  You never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I had given up on finding great BBQ in Phoenix. There is some good stuff out there but not like this. This BBQ is Texas style all the way and few places outside of Texas can duplicate. The moist brisket is amazing and I like their sides and desserts as well. The owners are always there and give that family feel to the place. I recommend this place to everyone I run across. ***Disclaimer, this is not the kind of place that will make your sandwich for you and drench food with BBQ sauce. You get the food by the weight and make it your self. Its Texas style, all about the meat! Get Bread if you want and add sauce if you want. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So after visiting Rudy's today, I was able to do a much closer comparison. Texas BBQ House definitely has better moist brisket than Rudy's!"}
{"text":"We decided to have Texas BBQ prepare the food for our work team Holiday Party.  We figured it would be good but had no previous experience.  All I can say is WOW!!!  Every aspect of the meal was incredible.  The folks on the other end of the phone were helpful, pleasant,  and knew their product!  They gave us a \"smokin' deal\" (no pun intended).  The delivery and set up was right on time to the minute.  We had not even expected delivery.  The food was amazing!  Everyone raved.  The brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It fell apart when the fork touched it.  The pork loin was moist and succulent.  The smoke was sweet and not harsh or overpowering.  All of the sides; cowboy beans, slaw, and potato salad were fresh and homemade with just the right kick.  Also featured was one of the best BBQ sauces I have had to date.  I am a former professional chef/caterer, working in education.  Believe me, I would not take the time to write this glowing review unless all of the components lined up right:  promises kept, food well prepared; clean, ample, and delicious, and great value!  Bravo Texas BBQ!!  You have not heard the last of me!"}
{"text":"Went here with a co worker I had the brisket. It was unbelievable. Super tender and great flavor. My co worker has ribs. He also said that they were great.  We went close to closing so they did not that much food left. So I would recommend going earlier in the day to have a larger selection. The meal also came with a side I had the Cole slaw which was also very good. The employees were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ in Arizona! I've tried other BBQ places in the valley and always paid a hefty price.  Texas BBQ House has the best meats and sides and for me,my wife and my 2 kids to eat was half the price of other restaraunts. I had the chicken(the meat just falls offf the bone!) My wife had the moist brisket(superb) my boys had the ribs and sausage.  The ribs r huge and delicious. Sausage was amazing.  The beans and the creamed corn are to die for.  I found my BBQ place! Like their sign says \"That's how we do it son!\""}
{"text":"Fans of good Texas-style BBQ (sauceless meat fests where your only true side dish is white bread, onions and jalapenos served up on butcher paper) will find delight here.  There is BBQ sauce, but it's an afterthought.  You can get sides of meaty pintos, creamy cole slaw, gooey mac and cheese and damn near sinful creamed corn.  But honestly, all of the above compete with the space you're gonna want to reserve for the meat.  

As far as I am concerned, the two offerings that I have dreams about are the fatty brisket (fall apart goodness that's juicy as hell) and the jalapeno sausage.  I slip into an amnesiac's haze when I eat them, devouring all in front of me and awakening once they are all gone.  Smoked turkey is surprisingly moist and full of flavor, and the pork loin is light and delicious.  The only miss on the menu for me is the chop beef - a near mash of meat and sauce that just doesn't do the trick.

Get a big ol' sweet tea before you leave, and order more than you think you'll eat, because you will definitely want it.  No fuss, no muss, just carnivore heaven.

PS. A lot of people have reviews here and they are for the Scottsdale location and not this place.  This one is in the middle of nowhere in Central Phoenix - it looks kind of like a roadhouse, which lends to the appeal."}
{"text":"This place is just plain FANTASTIC!!! We were just driving by and I told my wife we should try it out since we haven't had good BBQ in a while. Unfortunately we came around 3pm and they told us that their brisket was all sold out for the day but they still had other great meats available. So we tried the sausage links, ribs & pulled pork with potato salad and the mac & cheese.(and sweet teas of course) The food was so good we came back the next morning to get the brisket and we could see why it sells out because it was delicious! Perfect blend of smokey, moist and full of flavor!! The staff is SUPER friendly and make you feel very welcome. We will definitely be back again and again and again......."}
{"text":"This is a joke right? What idiotic restaurant owner is CLOSED at 6pm on a beautiful Saturday evening? Just drove by... 6:12pm and the place is boarded up. Next."}
{"text":"My mom and I been going there for a while. We absolutely LOVE the moist brisket. I found this place online almost 3 years ago. You got fans lol."}
{"text":"Found this place while searching for a good BBQ spot for lunch.
Thanks Yelp this place is very GOOD!
Don't judge the book by it's cover applies here. Outside appearance is less than spectacular as is the parking lot. Inside is a gem serving some of the best BBQ in Phoenix.
Brisket is the house specialty and offered in three options and is tender, juicy and very tasty. 
Staff is friendly, patient and seem to appreciate your business.
Word of advice this place gets very busy at lunch and parking is limited. If you need to park a little distance away don't worry they give you a lot of food and you will need to walk off the calories!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great staff, awesome BBQ! Born and raised in Memphis, I am definitely picky about where I eat BBQ, but I will have to say this place is top notch and has opened my eyes to Texas-style. Favorite meal: Moist brisket with side of creamed corn"}
{"text":"Today I took a friend to the airport and we decided to have lunch before her fight. We stopped at Texas BBQ House and had the best brisket. I've had some good BBQ in my time but this has to be top 5!!! Do yourself a favor and stop by! The ambiance is casual and friendly. It's a true dig in and eat type of place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ! But you cannot call in an order and the website does not provide a consistent experience to order your food. Last time I tried to submit my team's order (11 people) and the site crashed on me three times!"}
{"text":"Phoenix does not have many good BBQ joints. This is a true southern style rib shack. Excellent food. Great service! Get there early for lunch or you will be in line for awhile."}
{"text":"Whoa!  Sample what you want, over order, enjoy it and then deal with the guilt.  Great bbq!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  As good as or better then the reigning AZ BBQ Champ, LMB."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always left happily satisfied.  On this particular visit my friend and I had an amazon deal where we got a pound of brisket and two drinks.  We also ordered Texas cream corn, coleslaw and mac n cheese to share.  We got the small portions for all of them and the size was just enough to try everything and be satisfied.  Brisket was amazing without the sauce, but even better with it.  Super tender.  Coleslaw and cream corn were great and I'll definitely have those again.  I absolutely LOVE the cream corn.  I could have a big ol' container of just that.  The mac n cheese was good.  Not great, but good.  The sweet tea was AWESOME.  They should bottle that up and sell it.  The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and offered suggestions.  I loved the little boys that were working and hanging out.  From the look of things it seemed like their dad owns or runs the place.  One of them was so sweet and polite.  We would ask for things and he would say, \"yes mam, no mam, thank you mam\".  He even asked how everything was.  I'd go back just to hang out with him.  The only thing I noticed different from when I visited over a year ago was that they no longer sell beer and while I'd like a Shiner to add to my Texas bbq experience, the food and the staff are enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous when I drove into the neighborhood but I am a retired cop and in the daylight, it's ok.  I wasn't sure what to expect but when I walked in and saw some chubby white boys from Texas slicing up some brisket I knew I was at home.  I've been back several times and there isn't such a thing as a bad choice you can make here.  It's all good and well priced.  Pull up a bib and get ya some."}
{"text":"Had the brisket.  It was moist but too fatty.  Pulled pork -- portion size not bad but would have preferred sauce to be on the side. Too much sauce overpowers the flavor.  

Love that food is served on paper.  Seems environmentally friendly and gives homey feel. 

Pork ribs are really salty with a bunch of spices -- there's a kick there.  Definitely don't get the ribs because of the over spice. Meat does not fall off bone. Another reason to stay clear of them.  So disappointed.

Recommend the pinto beans and sweet tea.  That's all."}
{"text":"Once again great food. Texas cream corn is a must. Brisket, pulled pork as good as any we have ever had. Pecan pie and banana pudding homemade and wonderful. 
We come here whenever we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"A bit pricey. Very greasy. Small portions. Have had better mac and cheese. The meat was moist and fatty. Teammates suggested it. 
13.95 for beef brisket and macaroni and cheese = MUY MALO"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  This is the best beef brisket I've ever had.  Succulent and flavourful. Wow! I'll be suggesting it to anyone coming to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Don't miss out on the hidden local neighborhood gem.  All of the typical BBQ  selections.  Yummmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all of the hoopla is about this place!! The food is average and bland."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it."}
{"text":"We have been blessed by eating here on different occasions, we are NEVER ever disappointed with their brisket...the smoke ring around the brisket is to die for.  I like the brisket w/out BBQ sauce...as that is the true testimony of the quality of the brisket for me regarding the taste, moist, tender and melt in your mouth...Naked brisket is better. We luv the cream corn also."}
{"text":"This is the BEST BBQ in Arizona!!!!!! When you bite it to the Moist Brisket it's a explosion of excitement. The ribs have some amazing spices!!!!  What got me was the CORN. I hate cream corn. That was until now!!!! OMG words can not begin to tell you how amazing this was... The down side.... It a far drive for me but will sure as hell be back!!!! Try this place and be early!!!! When the food runs out they close down for the day!! And with how good it is it happens weekly!!!!!  This is by far the BEST I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after drive to South Mountain Park. Found it on Google and glad for it. Food is great. The atmosphere is perfect . Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a number of times, good friendly atmosphere (the owners kids help out sometimes with cleaning up and getting re-fills, which I thought was pretty cool.) The meat is smoked perfectly, good sauces (sweet and spicy, Texas style sauces) definitely a good spot to get that authentic Texas bbq fix...they even have Big Red at the fountain (nice touch). I've read on a few reviews that they've been closed due to running out of meat....Guess what, it happens! Especially with BBQ this good, why would you ding them on a review for that? Anyhow, definitely will continue to frequent so long as the food and service stay quality!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite and one of the best BBQ places in Phoenix! Everything is so yummy! They are famous for their Po' boy sandwich, sooo gooood! And their brisket is so juicy and delicious. Definitely worth checking out! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"They should change the name of this place to just \"BBQ House.\"  The Texas part is unfair to them as the BBQ in the state of Texas cannot stand up to this place.  I say this as I meander through Texas tasting any smoked flesh I can get my hands on.  

The brisket at the Texas BBQ House is the best I've ever had...hands down.  I've eaten enough in my time to fill an airplane hanger so I think I'm qualified on the subject.  If you fed this to a vegan, they'd leave the restaurant and go on a long spree of violence once they realized what they were missing in life.  It's that good.  Here's the thing though, average BBQ still tastes pretty good and most of your life you'll eat average BBQ.  Once in awhile you'll get a perfectly cooked brisket or pork shoulder or rack of ribs that blows your mind.  That's this place every single time.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd take a half-pound of their moist brisket over a surf and turf from any high end steakhouse if given the choice.  They only cook a given amount a day so make sure to get there early or call ahead to make sure they have what you want.  When a place sells out of food daily...that's a good sign.  They don't compromise their product by squeezing a few more briskets in the smoker.  They have a formula for delicious food and they stick to it.  

Some would say the location and shack-like appearence are a downside.  It's out of the way for sure but I find that to be a good thing.  If this place were near my home I'd weigh 400 lbs easily.  If you come here and don't like the food, you just don't like BBQ.  You might like BBQ sauce but you don't like BBQ.  And if you don't like BBQ, I weep for your misfortune."}
{"text":"Definitely the best bbq outside of Texas that I have had in the past 5 years. This place reminds me of home. I sampled a little of everything in my three visits and it is all good. Don't change a thing!!!"}
{"text":"Oh wow...this place was amazing.  Work place friend and I went for lunch based on the Yelp reviews.  We each got the PoBoy sandwich and it was huge.  It could easily be split between two people.  It had an assortment of meat and each was amazing in their own way."}
{"text":"The Phoenix New Times reports that this place has closed its doors just a few months after opening. I'm very surprised and frankly a little sad--I thought this was excellent Texas-style BBQ, and had a good location, and I feel bad this small business couldn't make it despite cranking out good product. 

Go to the South Phoenix location if you can. The BBQ is worth the trip."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ joint in Phoenix with amazing brisket! I've tried their giant beef ribs, St. Louis ribs, brisket, chicken, regular & spicy links. I would rank the St. Louis ribs as my second fave item on the menu. The links are probably the least of my fave. Their sides are ok, nothing over the top. The staffs are friendly and service is fast. This place keeps us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I have not had a better brisket ever.  

I'm a frequent visitor of PHX for work and have had the opportunity to try many places. Many may be put off by its location, which seems away from the city proper, but I know from experience that there are some great finds on roads less travelled. 

Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I told them I was new and asked them what were their best sellers.  Mike, who I later found out was the owner, cut me a not-so-shy slice of moist brisket.  The flavor blew me away.  From that initial experience, this has been a regular meal spot when I travel to PHX.

In many places that do dry-rub bbq, there isn't a heavy emphasis on sauce.  At texas bbq house, they once again stand out with a great regular and spicy sauce that adds to an already amazingly seasoned cut.  You don't need the sauce, but its good to know you have a good one on stand-by.

Im also perplexed on the other reviews regarding customer service.  They have always been friendly with me at lunch or dinner. This past visit I was greeted by 3 boys, the owners sons, who ensured visitors were taken care of and tables were cleaned for the next guests. A true mom and pop location that deserves praise!   

Thanks Mike and team!  See you next time!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in the morning Tuesday,  stopped there for lunch.   Friendly service,  generous meat portions,  pulled pork BBQ ok,  but nothing that special.  Side dish portions were skimpy.   Maybe I just ate too much meat, but I don't think so. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards hit with severe nausea.  We won't go into details,  but the last 16 hours haven't been fun.   And I even forgot to mention the yelp $3 discount."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town hands down!!!!!! Great staff met with great meat cuts..... It's a win win! Do yourself a favor and get the brisket moist!"}
{"text":"Great little family owned and run BBQ spot! The meat is awesome and melts in your mouth. Be sure you're a Dallas Cowboys fan, as this place is diehard Cowboys Country!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in Az.  worth a drive from anywhere.  Everything on the menu is kick ass and the service is friendly and helpful. Cashier chased me to my car with a bag I forgot and apologized, saying \"I should have made sure you remembered it\"--what a gem!!!  She gave me a big hug and told me to enjoy and come back soon.  I will!  Brisket, sausage, ribs and sides all perfectly done. Thank you, thank you."}
{"text":"I was so blown away! the service was amazing and I loved it!"}
{"text":"Great little BBQ, just South of Sky Harbor Airport.
Off the tourist track, but we'll worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing Barbecue! I can honestly say I've never been able to make it there in time, before they run out of Pork Spare Ribs! If you can get there before 11:15, you should be fine. But this is the best barbecue in the area, by far!

I'll damned sure pay the fee, to get this barbecue delivered! Their jalapeno Pinto Beans are awesome! The jalapeno smoked sausage, St Louis Style ribs and brisket (which has a perfect smoke ring on it) are all to die for! I highly recommend this restaurant, however you can get their food."}
{"text":"OK, I was born and raised in South Texas and was raised on a ranch.  We BBQed typically to feed a large group of people for a reasonable amount of money. I haven't lived in rural Texas for quite a while. Since than while still living in Texas I got great pleasure from a great plate of BBQ and a cold beer. In Texas this is not a luxury but its a right.

Since I've lived in Arizona I have found some OK BBQ, some that was pretty good and some that just down right sucked. In general I wasn't particularly fond of any one place to get BBQ and I didn't look forward to the prospect of being in the general area of any particular BBQ joint.

This all has changed tonight. I just had by far the best BBQ I have ever had in Arizona. \"Texas BBQ House\" has got it right. They understand what it's supposed to be and how to present it to the public. Let me tell you how BBQ is done in Texas and than I will explain my experience tonight.

In Texas:
*You are always treated with respect, a smile and feel welcome
*You always order your meat by the pound
*You never get a plate (meat paper) or a sandwich
*You have choices when it comes to what kind of Brisket (lean & moist, two separate things)
*You have a good selection of sides (beans, cole slaw, potato salad, corn)
*Sweet Tea is a must
*Good selection of condiments (pickles, onions, jalapeños)
*Shiner Bock Beer
*Decent country music playing

Texas BBQ House:
 *I was treated with respect, a smile and felt welcome
*I ordered my meat by the pound
*No plates only meat paper
*I had a choices of three types of Brisket
*I had a good selection of sides (beans, cole slaw, potato salad, corn
*i had Sweet Tea
*I had a selection of condiments (pickles, onions, jalapeños)
*A stack of Shiner Bock Beer
*They had decent country music playing

I have completed my search for Damn Good BBQ in Phoenix, if you haven't tried this place do yourself a favor and drop in.

Note: They are not on Scottsdale Road, they only take cash and they close at 7:00 PM. All more reasons for me to like this place, it's a tiny bit of Texas just south of the Airport."}
{"text":"Nationwide Barbecue tour continues -This place was very good their brisket is moist and smoky and I really liked it the ribs seemed a little overcooked in the hot box but we're also very good with a good crust on them.
The people were very friendly the sides were good but not great that's where the fifth star could come in for them. I don't get to phoenix very often but this place is a stop"}
{"text":"two words... \" Rediculous son !! \" ... finally a real BBQ spot thats warm and welcoming like back home.  I travel a lot and being from TX this is rare to find. They smoke their meats with a home made rub and its damn good.  To top it off, every one that works there is so helpful and energetic as hell.  I work in the west valley and we need these over here for real.  Great find and a must try, thanks gang 

JB"}
{"text":"FINALLY, More BBQ here in Old Town Scottsdale!

Food was great!  They even let you try a sample before ordering.  

Staff was 5 Stars!  There is NO wait staff.  You order your food, get your drink, sit down, eat, leave.  Really awesome concept.  You can get in and out at your own pace.  A nice change from most of the restaurants here in old town. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I had to check this place out. It first of all, looked pretty legit from the outside. Inside, looked pretty legit too! I had a few minutes before I needed to be somewhere, so I just got 1/4 of the moist brisket. I love when places keep the bark on the brisket, which is where a lot of the  flavor is. The brisket was super moist, very name appropriate. The spicy BBQ sauce was great. It wasn't very spicy, but it had a nice kick to it. I have to admit, this was pretty great brisket - they know what they're doing here. A little on the expensive side, but worth the try. I would definitely go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm not as enthusiastic as most reviewers here.  While I had no issue with the method/atmosphere of service (I kind of like the butcher paper/casual thing!), I was underwhelmed with the meat.  There was discernable smoke flavor and a smoke ring, but not as much as I normally would expect.  Also, the meat was a bit dry (even though I got the \"moist\" cut of brisket).  The sides we had (creamed corn and potato salad) were excellent.

In short, this place does NOT replace my valley favorite, Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Blows Rudys out of the water, hands down

Omg! Hands down, the best bbq in AZ.

You can sample (they encourage it) before you buy it.  The creamy corn and mac & cheese are pretty much outta the park!  The brisket is mmmmm mmmmm GREAT! (3 cuts to choose from).  Everything is smoked right there, infront of you."}
{"text":"We decided to head out for some BBQ, after finding this place on Yelp.  We weren't quite sure what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised.

Since it was our first time, the very nice and friendly woman at the counter let us sample some of their brisket...amazing!  Also, the gentleman who was cutting and serving the food, was quite friendly and answered questions.

We went with the sampler, so we could try a little bit of everything.  It consisted of:  pulled pork (my absolute favorite!!!), brisket (we got the moist, and it definitely was), chicken (juicy, but a little bland), St. Louis ribs (the meat was so tender...delicious!),turkey (surprisingly tender, moist and flavorful), sausage (also quite flavorful!) plus 2 sides--we decided on potato salad and cole slaw (both really good, but I favored the slaw).  It was also served with some white bread, which is perfect to make little sandwiches, or sop up some sauce.  They had 2 sauces, a mild and spicy one.  I prefer the mild, it was sooo deliciously sweet, I could almost drink it by itself.  Hubby tried the spicy, and it was a bit much for him.  So, he also stuck with the mild, and couldn't get enough of it.  Throw in a couple of iced teas, and you've got yourself a meal...actually 2, since there was so much food, we ended up taking some home and having it later.

My only \"complaint\" is the booths...they really need to update the seats.  They were all cracked and you could feel the springs as you slid into the dips.

We will definitely head out there again, it's a bit of a drive, but for that pulled pork, I'll go anywhere!!!

Oh, and by the way, it's all gone!  We devoured our leftovers while watching some TV...it was still delicious warmed up."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  The friendly staff is the only reason they get two stars.  Ordered Baby Back Ribs...... weak looking and tasted baked not slowly smoked for hours.  Where is the pink smoke ring????  Felt as if they had been sitting around since last night.  NO MOISTURE left in them at all.  My collegue had the \"smoked\" chicken and was similar in that it tasted baked and was dry as a bone.  The staff talked us into the \"homemade\" pecan pie which tasted and looked like it was right out of Quick Trip.  

Wont be back..... $37 for lunch for two and I could not have been more dissatisfied."}
{"text":"My kind of BBQ joint. Moist brisket and ribs were spot on. Right down the street from the airport and the Marriot Butte. The folks behind the counter couldn't have been nicer. When I wasn't sure what I wanted, they gave me a sample of each, so I got both. It'll be my go to place next time I'm in Phoenix. Great job, folks."}
{"text":"Brisket and St Louis ribs were really good."}
{"text":"I have a love for barbeque joints that has gone unsatisfied since moving here.  I drove past this place for two months multiple times per day and finally decided to meet up with a buddy for lunch.  
The guys at the counter were very friendly, very accommodating and offered samples of pretty much anything.  The moist brisket and pork are amazing.  We ordered the potato salad and the beans and the cream corn.  I wouldn't shut up about the beans.  We also got one of the jalapeno sausages.  It was pretty tasty as well.  
I also went for lunch one day and got their lunch special.  I was amazingly full by the time I left, but managed to have some of their pecan pie.  It was tasty!  I would definitely go back, and also wouldn't hesitate to recommend others to go.  
While I don't consume alcohol, I loved that when you walk in the door that there are coolers on the side that you can grab a bottle of beer out of.  It is a clean-feeling restaurant.  I liked that you order it by the pound and so, if desired, could order like 1/4 pound of this and 1/4 pound of that.  It is very affordable.  Two of us ate more than a healthy portion of food and it was only like $28.  Not bad for 3 sides, 3 servings of meat, drinks and bread.
 
It closes at 7pm though, so don't venture over here if you won't make it before then."}
{"text":"If you live out here in Phoenix there are a number of good BBQ places, many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ pork, specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce. Texas BBQ, at least from my own personal experience (born in Texas and raised there till I was twelve and moved to Hawaii, which has a very different type of BBQ), is generally dry rubbed and smoked and any sauce is put on after you get your meal, at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state there is a strong focus on beef BBQ and in addition, thanks to the many German settlers, it is also known for some great smoked sausage (in fact, if you find yourself in Corpus Christie take a drive out and go to Orange Grove, a small town, at least when I was there 20 years ago that is very German and wow, the sausage, but that is another story).

Well, this place, based on the BBQ brisket (always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ) makes some great BBQ and even better, it has the bare bones approach to cost that is standard in many little Texas BBQ joints and many great food hole in the wall places in general. It's not in, to say the least, the fancy part of town, all transactions are done in cash so leave your credit card at home, and the meal is provided on an empty soda crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced meat of your choice is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of bread you want, and you reply, they reach into the drawer below the cash register, rip open a loaf of sliced Wonder Bread (or the equivalent) and give you that to make the traditional folded sandwich of sliced meat and BBQ sauce on bread. You can also get a sandwich special but I'm a traditionalist, I'll make my own.

In addition, I have an obsession with potato salad at BBQ places (once again, an offshoot of the German influence, I would think, on Texas BBQ cuisine and boy, the potato salad here is classic potato salad. Oh, and to drink, if you are off work, they do have Shiner Bock, in the bottle, along with a number of other beers and if you look up the Shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong German influence and one thing that I don't think is German, but definitely Texas, Country Music on the sound track.

Now, for those looking for a luxury experience, you may need to go to Joe's BBQ, which two of my 3 dining companions said they liked better (the whole slices of Wonder Bread did not excite them, but one of the people, along with me, was sold on this place....it is VERY authentic Texas hole-in-the-wall BBQ and it does that well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the BBQ experience, then some other place may be more to your liking."}
{"text":"Awesome moist brisket, you gotta try it.  Fast courteous service....definitely will go back soon."}
{"text":"Just happened to drive down this road which led me to Texas bbq house, u turned and stopped in for lunch. Friendly staff, and the food was D-lish! I happy I found this restaurant it's not a huge place it's was very comfortable and you can tell they put a lot into the food. If your looking for some yummy bbq and are in the area stop in."}
{"text":"After landing from a long flight, my husband and I wanted something casual, quick and delicious. ..this was it!! Found it through yelp and so glad we did. It's family owned and they were super friendly.  We had brisket, creamed corn and mac'n'cheese. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Phoenix area from San Diego and have been in search of good BBQ.  Seems like most places add smoke flavoring which does not taste good to me.  Texas BBQ House does not add smoke!  That lets the flavor of their meat speak for itself.  And boy does it ever.  This is THE best BBQ.  I can't decide between the cutter's choice brisket and the pulled pork as my favorite.  They are both so good!  Hands down the best side dish is the creamed corn.  As the very helpful employee said, \"This is not your mama's creamed corn!\"  It is unbelievably delicious.  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent Texas BBQ from a little hole in the wall! Some reviewers here seem to be confusing this place with one in Scottsdale listed elsewhere on Yelp. Too bad as it affects their rating. We went on a Sunday about an hour before they closed so unfortunately they were out of the sausage I wanted to try. Offered a sample of brisket and man was it good (and I am very picky about fatty meat)! Decided on the pulled pork, side and drink special for $8.99. The pork was delicious as was the mac & cheese side. Reviews on here complaining about food served on a piece of butcher paper, the decor, and some of the other negatives must not have ever eaten BBQ in a real Texas joint. If you're not going for the great Texas BBQ, then please don't go.You'll ruin it for the rest of us. It's a half hour drive for us to get there but we will definitely be going back. This would be a great stop for food before a DBacks game."}
{"text":"Love this place, always come here when I am on this side of town. 

Do yourself a favor and try the po boy."}
{"text":"Great service and cool staff. Had the sausage, brisket and pull pork Po'Boy - be careful for what you ask for...Excellent BBQ! Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"As I said in my \"quick tip\" this place is AMAZING!!! Dell, Vanessa, and the quiet guy in the back were so nice, friendly and accommodating. We arrived minutes before closing and the treated us as if it were 2:00 in the afternoon. I have never had BBQ that tasted so DELICIOUS!! How about Texas BBQ House - San Francisco...then I won't have to travel so far."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Brisket is perfectly cooked and the ribs are to die for.  Make sure you get some mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Yum! That's all I can say. BBQ sauce is out of this world. Wish they had a bigger building...but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Wow, I have heard about this place from customer's for years and never been a BBQ fan.  I went because I saw the great reviews and I do like brisket and took my husband there and was so impressed with the food and service.  When we got there the lady was like, is this your first time, would you like to sample our brisket? It was great, will for sure come back again and maybe do  take out to my customer's who love it too!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty much awesome.  I have been missing southern bbq, and this place hit the spot.  We got here close to 7 without realizing that was their closing time, but staff was so warm and friendly and accommodating for us.  My friend and I shared a 1/2 lb of the pulled pork, which you can get with slices of white bread to make sandwiches, and we ordered creamed corn, green beans, and coleslaw as our sides.  Definitely go for the creamed corn-- creamy and delicious!  The green beans were good, filled with little bits of pork in it, and it had a very subtle kick to it.  The coleslaw was refreshing and tasty, great seasoning.  The pulled pork was delicious, super tender, juicy, and went great with both the sweet and spicy bbq sauces they had to offer.  This place thinks of everything- from ziploc bags for takeout to wet wipes for your bbq sauce stained fingers.  We had wanted to order the ribs, but they had already sold out!!  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will definitely come back!  Just plan your visit well-- they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very nice people! Moist Brisket is the best I have ever had! This is our favorite place to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great barbecue!!!  The brisket was very tender and tasty.  My husband got seconds on the turkey and my daughter loved the pulled pork (she is a picky eater).  The coleslaw was good, the creamed corn was fabulous; the green beans were a bit too mushy and the macaroni and cheese was not the best.  Service was friendly and helpful.  This is a very relaxed atmosphere and very small seating area.  Don't miss this place - it's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star. This review is for brisket & sausage only because I don't do sides.... Moist brisket was great.... Really some of the best brisket I have had west of the Rio Grande..... The sausage was a great blend of beef & pork.... If you want Texas BBQ in AZ this is your place... If you don't like it ... You don't like Texas BBQ... So don't blame the establishment. I did not give them a 5 star because they could of knocked that brisket out of the park If they used a real smoker and not an electric smoker... You can only go so far with an electric smoker... Cmon boys get off yer lazy asses and buy a real smoker and rival TEXAS!"}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ fan but let me tell you............... Went in and ordered the Po Boy, they gave me a sample of the brisket. That was the best piece of meat I ever had.  The sandwich was pretty darn good as well. Had a sausage link some brisket and some pulled pork. Was mighty tasty. Its a bit pricey though, 13 bucks for this beast but was delicious ! The sausage is a bit peppery but great flavor !"}
{"text":"Very simple and delicious brisket. Their homemade spicy BBQ sauce was awesome, and the service was super quick and friendly. We got to try the sides before picking the pinto beans. The chicken was also moist. Very big servings and ziplock bags are ready for leftovers. Simple atmosphere, no fuss, country music and sports in the tv. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best options out there for BBQ in Phoenix.  I ordered the cutter's choice brisket with a side order of macaroni and cheese.  The brisket was decent and the macaroni and cheese was average to me.  I would like to try and go back to try their turkey or ribs.

To me, Little Miss BBQ has better brisket and it's my favorite bbq place around.  However, this place has better hours of operation.

I would recommend this place because the bbq is good and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"Parking: It's a little sketchy with the barber shop next door but still not bad, plenty of parking.

Entrance:
Greeted by a couple of cashiers not sure which is willing to take my order. 

Food:
I order jalapeno sausage and regular sausage to see what the two were like. Mind you guys my review has a 31 years of experience of Texas bbq eatin. Always about the good ol sausage. However, this was not the experience I was looking for. I got it to go and when I got to where I was going, I decided to dive into the Jalapeno sausage and after unwrapping it, just by looking at I notice it looked super dry. I was even afraid to take a bite of it. I did it anyways and it was disgusting, I wouldn't have served that to any guys. Owners if you are going to use the Texas name, you sure as the hell need to get it together. You're not representing Texas in great spirit. I'm actually kind of upset your using the name and selling that crap to anyone for that matter. I'm not going to discredit the regular sausage because it wasn't as dry and tasted pretty good. But let's just say the jalapeno sausage left a bad taste behind.

Why not a 5:
Well no need to go into details, hopefully you fix your issues, not sure how you became highly rated, but I'm in hopes my next visit I'll be able to see why. True Texan believes in second chances."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork Sandwich. Cream Corn. Mac & Cheese. Pecan Pie. Sweet. AMAZINGGGGGGG!!! Now back to eAting."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good prices for downtown Scottsdale but mediocre food puts the kabosh on this place.  Chicken was pretty tasty but the jalapeno sausage was horrible.  Got a free sample of the brisket and while tasty seeing the cook butcher the slab and scraping off the crust was horrific in bbq terms."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price!!  BBQ sauce is outstanding!  HUGE portions, friendly atmosphere,  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"- The moist brisket was full of smoky flavor and had the perfect amount of fat.

- The pulled pork was a little bland and had too much sauce.

- The sausage links were perfect. Just a hint of smoke and still crisp and juicy.

- The green beans were delicious.  The potato salad was above average. The mac n cheese was ok.

- The mud pudding was pretty good, but describing it as a blizzard with pudding instead if ice cream made me want to go to DQ.

- Prices are a little high for BBQ in AZ, but on par with what I've experienced in TX.

- Very friendly staff.

My family and I will definitely be back.  It's our sole good BBQ option in AZ now."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I am skeptical about all things barbecue and chicken fried outside of home.  Most places, hard as they try, will never get it right.  That being said, Texas BBQ House was like stepping into a teleporter that brought me right back to the doorstep of home.  
Served up in a traditional Texas style, you walk up to the counter and order various meats by the pound.  They are sliced right in front of you, placed on butcher paper and set in a plastic crate.  You grab cold sides from a reach in fridge and order hot sides from one of the nice men at the counter.  They've got sweet tea, the good Coke (the Mexican kind in the bottle that still has real sugar), and IBC in a bottle.  Doesn't get much better than that.  Every single meat (and I do believe we tried them all) was moist and just seemed to fall apart as you picked it up.  A quality Famous Dave's has yet to master with their brisket.  The boyfriend and I decided to try order as much as we could, stuff ourselves, and go home with leftovers.  As we ordered, the staff would cut us both samples of each meat.  We were not disappointed in a single one.   After loading up on brisket, jalapeno sausage, pork loin, and ribs, they brought us samples of the creamed corn and pinto beans.  Both were excellent, but we just went with creamed corn (like we didn't already have enough food).  And what kind of barbecue dinner is complete without potato salad and coleslaw?  So, we threw both of those on as well. In true Texas tradition, they hand you as many slices of white sandwich bread as you'd like, you pay, and you're on your way to carnivore heaven.  
Like I said, everything we had was delicious and I guarantee this little gem would not be shunned back home.  There are LCD televisions in every corner and they'll put on whatever game you'd like to watch.  It's chilly now, but during the nicer months you can enjoy your feast outside on picnic benches under a covered patio.  It's in the middle of nowhere, (24th street and Broadway) we nearly missed it, but they are opening a second location in Scottsdale sometime in January 2012.  I think I'll still head out to this one, though, as I can't really see myself eating barbecue around the Scottsdale crowd.  They close early (7 pm) so don't waste daytime.  
Next time I'm in, we'll try not to overload ourselves and leave room for dessert.  I'm eager to try the banana pudding and the boyfriend loves pecan pie. So, I'll update on that as soon as we get hungry again."}
{"text":"Went there again today. Had the Texas po-boy. Super good. Probably the best bbq sandwich I've ever had. The creamed corn was outstanding. High recomedations to all. Every time I go here it's very, very good. Again best brisket I've had...recomend the one with some fat on it."}
{"text":"Tasty Pulled pork with option of how hot you want the sauce. Nice people working there so fast polite service with a sweet smile:) Always busy at lunch so you know it's good and I was in and out (take out order) in 8 mins - perfect for local lunch!"}
{"text":"The brisket is wonderful, super tasty bark, nice smoke ring.  We got the cutters choice which is in between the juicy yet fattier cut and the lean cut, a good all round compromise.  Wasn't a big fan of the sauces, not bad but nothing spectacular but the brisket is so good you really dont need any.

The mac&cheese is good, as is the cole slaw, wasn't a fan of the cream corn, just too sweet for me. I wish they had some greens to choose from."}
{"text":"I literally just demolished the Texas po boy in 15 minutes. Awesome bbq served the right way, smoked fresh in house, cut fresh when ordered, dry except the pulled pork and chopped brisket, but sauce is on the table. House made of course. A tiny little shop with a tiny patio that's worth seeking out if you're in the South valley! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious. The brisket was fantastic. Everything was good. 

Can't wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"The search for amazing barbeque in Phoenix is over!  I have driven past the BBQ house for a few months, always wanting to stop and finally did.  Walking in ordering my food, I was reminded of Rudy's, and as I ate my brisket i was throughly impressed.

The brisket is moist and flavorful, the potato salad was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect.

By far the best barbeque in Phoenix, I've already recommended this restaurant to friends and co-workers!"}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 5 stars for the meats and the service!!!  I ordered the pork loin (ordered chopped) and creamed corn which were extremely good.  I also tried the lean brisket and moist brisket.  The sample of moist brisket was the best I have ever tasted; I would have ordered it, but sampled it after I bought the pork loin.

I have to knock it down one star for a few reasons, but I will be back many, many times for sure!   I was not a big fan of the banana pudding; it did not taste very fresh today.  A couple of the reviewers noted how good it was; I may have ordered it on an off day.   I am also disappointed that you can not order a traditional sandwich; basically, they give you white sandwich bread and offer to chop the meat up for you.  There is only one type of BBQ sauce, and I am not a huge fan of it.  But as the other reviewers noted, the meat tastes so good you may not even want any sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, simple, affordable and a very high quality product to boot. Power to Texas BBQ as old town definitely needs more high-quality food served quickly. I loved my brisket (avoid the lean cut - too dry). The sauce is incredible."}
{"text":"Best BBQ PO' BOY I've ever had!! Love the spicy bbq sauce - sweet and has just enough kick to it, meat - tender with so much flavor , even the bread was so good! The Mac n' cheese and coleslaw was tasty too. They have good ice tea, tastes freshly brewed. I'll definitely be back the next time I crave bbq!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Texas & this is the closest to \"home\" bbq in the Valley!  Even my NYC boyfriend loved it!  Reasonably priced with a great selection with nice-sized portions!  The brisket was cooked perfectly; and is good with OR without the wonderful bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"I didn't feel like waiting in line for an hour at the other critically acclaimed BBQ place not far from here so I decided to give Texas BBQ house a try and I'm glad I did.

It was a Friday so I was disappointed to find out that they were out of ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. But they were able to throw together a custom sampler plate for me with their brisket, turkey, and 2 types of sausage. It did not disappoint.

The brisket was \"fatty brisket\" and it was packed with flavor. I'm a BBQ junkie so I've had some of the best brisket in the world and their brisket is right up there.

The Turkey might have been the best BBQ turkey I've ever had. Sliced thick, tender, and packed with flavor.

Their jalapeno sausage did outshine their regular sausage, but both were fantastic. 

This place is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite barbecue spot in Arizona. They are consistent with their food and the customer service is always on point. I like my Brisket with a little fat on it and their cutting is perfect. My girlfriend likes hers with fat all the way through and I must say it's pretty good also. Their St. Louis Ribs are tender and flavorful before the sauce is even thought about, and the Hot Links while smaller than I'm use to pack a nice punch of spice and flavor. I also like that the Mac & Cheese is cheesy, already seasoned, and not runny like its out of a cheap box. The Green Beans are also full of flavor with just the right amount of meat mixed in. I can't wait to go back and eat. 

Now I recommend calling ahead if your going after work or close to closing time. They once ran out of every meat except pulled pork, but that's when I knew I was going to be back. If they run out of meat it must be good!

{"text":"Not bad.

I tried this place out a little while back as I had passed it many times and finally decided to check the reviews on the place.  I was surprised to find such high reviews this place so I figured what the heck?

I love BBQ and can't get enough of a good brisket.  So we decided to try the brisket here.  The guy told us that they only have so much per day and it is best to come in earlier to ensure that we get some.  We decided to try the moist and the cutter's choice and a couple variations of sauce, original and spicy.  

Overall, it wasn't bad.  The moist brisket definitely lives up to the name and the cutter's choice had a pretty good texture to it.  The spicy sauce had more spice than flavor though.  I would recommend the cutter's choice and the original sauce personally.  It isn't as good as some of the BBQ I have had in New Orleans but it is decent for something closer to home if the hankering arises.  

If you haven't tried it yet, I think you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I only just stumbled on my having given Texas a 4 start because they were cash only back in the day, but now that that's long been resolved, it's fully deserving of 5-star. The brisket is some of the best I've ever had. The smoked wings are a thing of beauty. The mac and cheese is amazing. This place does true BBQ right, and without the 3 hour wait of some other joints."}
{"text":"Amazeballs!!!!

This is not just some of the best barbecue in Arizona this is some of the best barbecue in the country. These people know what's up. Moist brisket and the spareribs will blow your mind. Not to mention the fact that they carry beef ribs! That's amazing

The place is def a dump however and seating is fairly limited. They need one of these on the East Side!

DOWNSIDE: CRAZY EXPENSIVE considering they are in a bad neighborhood and their rent is probably nothing. They are def proud of their BBQ to charge what they do for it."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for BBQ if your flying in/out or have a layover in Phenoix.  Hands down some of the best brisket I've had in a long time.  So close to the airport that with a long layover it would be easy to step out for a bit and grab a bite.  You can order in pounds if you like but they always have daily specials for a quick meal.  The BBQ sauce rivals that I've had before in Nashville. A must stop if your in town."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite to eat and found this gem on Yelp. Great BBQ and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I picked up lunch today. I made my order online. Good service when I got there. I returned home and realized they forgot my potato salad. I picked up the phone to call and let them know. I saw they called me first and left a message. I called back, they adked if I wanted to drive back up there for it. I decided to take the refund. Where I got my receipt online they refunded the total amount of both lunches I bought. That made the difference between a bad experience and feeling a little bonded to this place. BTW - the food is really good."}
{"text":"First time here and it was hands down amazing. BBQ sliders were so  delicious and ribs were so tender fell right off of the bone. Great friendly servi. We will be back"}
{"text":"I've had better but this one was good, better than I've found so far in Phoenix. But it was a bit pricey for me and inconvenient that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"The best Texas BBQ is not in Texas, it's in the heart of Phoenix. No wonder this place has high reviews and really famous in the area. Don't be scared of the outside setting (i did but still went in); the service is good and noticed their kitchen has nice appliances too. Will definitely go back. Tenderest meats and yummy BBq sauce! 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com. Cashier gave us nice size samples of the brisket and it was perfect. Ate to quick to snap pics , but the pulled pork sliders are delish. Lunch specials include side and drink."}
{"text":"Love walking into a place where the owners remember who you are no matter how long it's been between visits!  The food is amazing as always and the service is great to boot...check them out and feel free to tell them that \"southwest chick\" sent you!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy they put a location in Old Town.  I had been to the location in South Phoenix before and it was awesome as well.  

I had the Chopped BBQ which is Turkey, Chicken, and Beef all chopped up and cooked in BBQ sauce.  It was very very tasty.  They gave me two pieces of bread to make a sandwich and with the 1/2lb order I still had more left over.  

For my side I got the Texas Cream Corn which I really enjoy.  It has great flavor and is an excellent compliment to the BBQ.  

The location has a nice patio for the great weather we are having and you can also sit inside on picnic style tables."}
{"text":"Stilll the best BBQ is Arizona.  The kid ate the \"Po' Boy\", a pound total of sausage, brisket, and pulled pork.  Yummy.  What few asked, so what's good here?  I said, \"it's all good in da hood\".  Cause they're in the hood."}
{"text":"Hate to do it, but today's meal was whack and totally deserving of this one star rating!

I had this place bookmarked for awhile and am seriously trying to hit a low carb diet pretty hard in order to lose some weight.  Low carb options are somewhat limited when eating out, so I figured a plate of meat would fit the bill.  I drove down, parked in the lot, and walked inside.

I asked the cashier lady (very friendly btw...best part of the visit) how everything worked.  She explained how everything is served by weight and even gave me a sample of fatty brisket to sample since it was my first time here.  I decided to go with a 1/4lb fatty brisket, a sausage link, and 3 pork spare ribs.  That and a fountain drink came out to $27.50!  I know BBQ is expensive, but sheesh!  It better be good for almost $30.00!  I took my tray to my table and dug in.  Here is how everything was...........

Fatty Brisket-  This was the best meat of the bunch, and even then, it was barely edible.  I am down with the fat.  Fat=flavor.  I am NOT down with whale blubber, gelatinous type fat.  This brisket had a huge bark of whale blubber fat.  I picked off most of it, and ate the actual meat part and it was decent.  Not the worst brisket I have ever had (Rudy's in Goodyear takes the cake on that one!), but nowhere even close to the best brisket I have had.  1/4lb is about 2 slices.  Probably should have tried the lean?  Who the hell knows....disappointed though! 

Sausage Link-  Dry and chewy.  Flavor wasn't that great either!  Reminded me of eating a dried up hot dog.  At almost $5.00 for this link, I felt it was not worth it at all.  I made my way through about half of the link and couldn't eat any more.

Pork Spare Ribs-  These things were huge.  That is not necessarily good though.  The outside bark had a decent peppery taste, but the meat was a little tough, tasted like it was boiled, and just flat out didn't smell or taste too appealing.  I made my way through about 3/4 of one rib and was done...couldn't eat any more.  

I boxed up my remaining sausage and 2 ribs and gave them to a homeless lady standing by the 17 freeway entrance.  While I was there at the light, she sat down, opened the box, took a couple of bites and then closed the box and stood back up to continue begging on the side of the road.  That right there should tell you something....a hungry, homeless person didn't even like the ribs and sausage enough to sit there and eat them!  Fuck, right?  

Not sure how so many people love this place.  Service was very friendly, and that is the only positive thing I have to say about this visit.  There are way better BBQ places in town (Little Miss, Naked BBQ, even Rudy's is better than this joint!).  As I write this, about 4 hours later, my stomach hurts and it feels like I have to barf. $27.50 poorer...all for some barely edible BBQ.  Horrible!  I will never come back!"}
{"text":"Great bbq! I don't typically enjoy bbq, but I enjoyed the Texas Po boy sandwich I got here. It's a 1 lb sandwich filled with pulled pork, cutter's choice brisket, and link sausage. The meat was very tender and juicy. Meanwhile, the sausage added a nice kick of spice to each bite. The bun was nice a soft. The portion was also huge -- I could only eat half the sandwich. I saved the other half for later, and it was just as good (maybe ever better) later!

Service was good and fast. Upon arrival, we were offered samples of meat, which were delicious! We also used the check-in offer on Yelp to save a few bucks. Once your food is ready, it is placed in a big blue bin instead of plates, which is fine by me."}
{"text":"Hot diggity damn, there's a new BBQ place in town (and by \"town\" I am referring directly to the imaginary place my dreams occur in.) 

The pulled pork and coleslaw are not to be missed (shredded things drenched in tasty sauce = all systems go), and save room for the old-fashioned banana pudding. Not many folks in the Southwest can make a banana pudding like these fellas... and even fewer can make my mother literally pull the dessert we're sharing away from me and finish it before I've had my second bite. 

Between BBQ sauce that I'd lick off the bottom of an old cowboy boot and brisket that makes me feel disloyal to my own grandmother's secret recipe, these are the areas where Texas BBQ truly shines. There's no question that this comfy hole-in-the-wall knows how to put a sauce-stained smile on my face."}
{"text":"\"I have the meat sweats\"

AWE AWESOME all the way around. Brisket was perfect,Texas poor boy simply fantastic,Jalapeno link was amazing & the mac&cheese was off the chain.
My 1st experience was this past Saturday & I drove from Surprise needless to say I will be back.Be prepared to open your wallet & enjoy all that they have to offer."}
{"text":"I was on a quest...BBQ and smoked goodness that could meet or beat the standard set by my favorite BBQ place, Rudy's, which is a Texas based chain with locations in Albuquerque. I rarely give 5 stars on first visit and this was pretty darn close...by PHX standards this is easily 5 stars!

Fate delivered an article in a local food Blog, It was touted as being like Rudy's as a result I took that as a challenge. Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.  
The locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's. 

 What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalapeños. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy.
The sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most. 
I didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well.
I was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding. 

Rudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley.
[It's CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM on site.]"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Very helpful when choosing items or can't decide on what to order. I got brisket and pulled pork. They were delicious, just wanted to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The PO Boy was delicious! ; but it was expensive and it didn't come with sides. The place is small, very personal, and the  workers weren't the most welcoming."}
{"text":"Checked out Texas BBQ House while visiting Phoenix on a work trip. Tried the lean and fatty brisket, as well as the jalapeño sausage. The sausage was out of this world - probably one of the best smoked sausages I've ever had. The brisket, on the other hand, was just okay. In general, at least for my palate, the smoke flavor was too subtle - parts of the lean meat without the bark tasted like brisket coming out of an oven, despite the amazing smoke ring. I'd probably go back for the sausage, but in my opinion, a place that dares to put \"Texas\" and \"BBQ\" in its name absolutely has to nail brisket."}
{"text":"TEXAS PO BOY

AMAZING

This sandwich changed my perspective on BBQ. I'm  usually not a huge fan and could care less. This food was incredible and I absolutely could not finish it despite my trying due to how filling and large it was. (Apparently people usually split it)

I didn't photograph the establishment but I should have photographed the line GOING OUT THE DOOR. I beat the lunch rush, but let me tell you, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  Love when I find these gems, thank you Yelp!  Brisket is so good and I love their green beans wow!!! Will definitely be back as the hubby loves his bbq."}
{"text":"Note: CASH ONLY ... ok now that we got that out of the way ... Fabulous BBQ with amazing service. Great flavor - they'll let you sample a bit before you order just so you know what you're getting. Great quality meats with amazing flavor. Real Texas BBQ. We'll definitely be back. Take out or dine in ... just remember CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this placed opened. service was great at first, but now that they are getting really busy, you got to wait in line for awhile to get your food at busy times, service is ok. so expect to wait in line if it's busy. food is still great though, so i try and go when it's not busy at all, don't go at noon:)"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing meal. Had the sampler. It was full of amazing awesomeness.

This is easily the best BBQ place in Phoenix. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Omg this is the best kept secret in Phoenix . The Texas Po'boy is unreal sausage pork tenderloin and pulled pork is a must try. The Ribs are phenomenal  tender moist and meaty. Please try this place I promise you will not be sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"The BBQ at this place is insanely good!!! The first order I ever had was the moist brisket and experienced a tiny bit of heaven. I've never really had genuine before Texas BBQ but if this is it I'm completely sold. 

All that aside it's at a great location and the food is high quality. They do not give you plates so be prepared to eat with your hands. I've been here several times after my initial visit and have sampled many of different meats that they offer. I've been impressed everytime and highly recommend Texas BBQ to anyone looking for great tasting meal especially barbeque"}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy in this place.  Very simple presentation of very good food.  I ordered the brisket and pork loin, and both were quite good.  I purposely got a pound of food so I could take some home as leftovers.  Friendly, helpful staff.  The mac and cheese was homemade and tasty as well.  

The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but that's OK."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ brisket I've ever had!  It's hard to find good BBQ in California where I'm from, so I have to search for spots when I travel.  Found this gem and was I impressed!  

Spoke with the owners after my meal to learn more. The owner's (husband and wife) run the place as the chef and cashier.  They are from Corpus Christi, TX, so they indeed can claim \"Texas BBQ\" to their name.

Brisket was incredible moist and tender.  They apparently smoke their brisket in Oakwood for 18 hours.  Also samples Pulled Pork, St. Louis ribs, and a hot link.  Pulled Pork was also 5-stars!  Ribs and hot link weren't anything special but were still tasty (Phil's BBQ in San Diego still is king of ribs IMO).  

If you give Texas BBQ house a try (and you certainly should) definitely stick to Brisket and Pulled Pork.  It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my BBQ. I really am and I rarely like eating it out. But this place is amazing. Brisket...incredible. Sides are amazing, the sweet tea is spot on. Now they have sandwich specials for lunch (with a small side). I can't stay away. Pulled pork sliders and this unreal meat mountain sandwich they call a Texas po boy. Wow.  
Stopped in for a larger order to take to work and they very nicely filled it for me even though I didn't call ahead. Great people, great food!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal. From the brisket to the turkey (and especially the po-boy). One of the best Texas BBQ places in town with minimal wait and fuss."}
{"text":"In Phoenix. Trusted my yelp buds and found his place. Was not disappointed. Yum. Yum. The brisket was off the charts and fell apart and melted in your mouth the ribs were not the best ever but they were excellent. It was the brisket that was beyond compare. I love this place. Super nice people down home food. All da best!"}
{"text":"Unlike most of the folks who wrote real reviews down below, I'm not from TX and I've never tried TX BBQ.  I can't compare it to any place in Austin, Dallas or Lubbock.  But I have taste buds.  And they liked it.  They liked it a lot.  

I love BBQ.  Sure, there's better and worse BBQ around town based on where ya go, but generally speaking if I go to a BBQ place, I'm going to enjoy myself.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to recommend the place, or come back again, and it really doesn't mean that I'm going to write a review on it.  But as I sit here wondering how I ate that whole freaking sandwich, I know that I have just had one of the best BBQ nights in a long, long time.  And once my stomach isn't full (say, tomorrow afternoon?) I'll be calling friends to plan our next trip there.  

OM-frickin-G it is awesome!  As has been mentioned in other reviews they hooked us up with some samples when we said we hadn't been there before.  Sure, their brisket leaves this taste of buttery meat in your mouth (if you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you) and makes you want much much more - but why has no one mentioned the turkey?  We only got a sample of it, but DANG I could eat a lot of that!  One day when I'm trying to be \"healthy\" I'll get that but today was not that day.

I got what I believe was called the Big ol' Boy sandwich.  When he called back for the guys to make it he said to make a BIg ol' Girl.  Nice touch dude.  So the sandwich is 1/3 pound each of BBQ chopped pork, brisket and hot links.  I am not a fan of hot links, but figured I'd give it a shot as I liked the general concept (It actually comes out as a sandwich vs. it being a make your own thing...).  I LOVED the hotlinks.  That casing had an awesome \"pop\" as you bit into it, had a black pepper-y hint that I loved, and was good enough that I would almost contemplate trying one solo.  And I have NEVER felt that way about a hot link before.

Between our samples and our meals I got to try all 3 kinds of brisket and I don't know that I'll be able to tell you my favorite.  Like picking a favorite child.  Sure, Bobby is the juiciest, but Jimmy tastes intense and smokey...well, you know what I mean...

Not sure how new this is - but they now have 2 BBQ sauces for your eating pleasure.  Normal and HOT.  Hot won't burn your lip, but definitely makes the tongue to a double take.

And the service.  Clap... Clap... Clap..Clap..Clap.Clap.Clap.Clap!!!  Right on point.  By the end of the end of our introduction to the food we knew what things were made fresh that day, what things were made every other day or weekly, and which ones came from his Grandma's kitchen.  Thank you Grandma - for both the recipes and raising folks right.  Folks were just as sweet as that tea.  

I was also happy to see that even though we got there around 6:20pm and they close at 7pm, there were 3 big parties and 1 to go order that came after us.  Please folks - keep these people busy!  Don't you dare let this place go out of business because I have found my new BBQ heaven.  

Review done.  Tummy still full.  Texting friends to make our next trip..."}
{"text":"Not bad but I've had better.  I give the brisket a B-.  It was good.  I certainly wouldn't call meat smoked on a pellet cooker Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"From my vegetarian perspective (I went with my Texan, carnivorous husband), I had to try all the sides with #1 being the tastiest:
1. Cream Corn
2. Potato Salad
3. Coleslaw
4. Mac & Cheese
My husband says the brisket had good bark, was moist, and worthy of an hour drive, which won't really work since we live in Sedona. While I was writing this review, he ate all my sides, and now I am pissed."}
{"text":"I went by Texas BBQ House today, and it appears they have closed down already. I thought the extra lean brisket there was decent, but not as good as Rudy's, which I recommend as an alternative. One thing that rankled me about Texas BBQ House was the high price on the stuffed baked potato. Another issue was the parking. Finally, the dining area was very cramped. I've never been to the South Phoenix location, but if I'm going to drive that far, I would go to Rudy's instead."}
{"text":"This is real Texas bbq. The brisket is excellent as well as the sausage. Side dishes are great as well. Very busy place in south Phoenix and the parking lot gets filled up quickly. Certainly worth the drive from east Mesa. This is as good bbq as you will find even in south Texas."}
{"text":"I would have given this 3.5 stars if it was an option. I ordered the fatty brisket (.5 lb serving), a side of potato salad, and a cup for water. It was $11 after a $3 off coupon they offered for Yelp users. The value was fine, as this is about the market rate for BBQ. I noticed the menu had a few lunch specials that appeared to have a solid value. 

The location is just off the northeast corner of the intersection and parking is limited. I would recommend carpooling if you plan on visiting with others. We arrived during the noon hour and service was concise and cordial. If you don't have time to wait out Little Miss BBQ - the best BBQ in Phoenix, in my estimation - this would seem to be a timely alternative and not far from the interstate. There's a fair amount of seating outside and picnic tables on the patio.

The brisket was good. Definitely above average but it didn't stand out. If I could go back, I would have ordered lean brisket because the fatty wasn't trimmed properly and there was some waste I had to cut off myself. If the price was a little lower, again, $9.30 is certainly reasonable for a half-pound, I could more easily excuse there being some waste. The flavor and moisture were both solid, though the burnt ends were a bit rubbery. There wasn't a strong smoky flavor to it but it was still satisfying. 

As for the sides, the potato salad was decent. Nothing remarkable but certainly complementary with the brisket. The portion was pre-scooped into a cup and refrigerated. A friend I was with ordered the mac 'n cheese which I found to be quite good. The cheese was silky and had a pinch of pepper dashed in to add some dimension. 

Overall, I was pleased with my experience and there was nothing, in a vacuum, that would keep me from returning. If I find myself craving some BBQ in the future and I don't have the time to wait at Little Miss, this is certainly an alternative I would consider."}
{"text":"Took the fam here the other night and was thoroughly impressed! Usually brisket isn't done right and ends up dry, but they did it perfectly! Pretty sure it's my husband's new favorite BBQ place :)"}
{"text":"In general, I love BBQ.  I grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to BBQ in the winter!  

I tried a few BBQ places when I first moved here, but I gave up on BBQ in Phoenix shortly after moving here and I didn't eat BBQ unless I cooked it.  Unfortunately for  all BBQ places in Phoenix (past, present and future), as far as I am concerned, there is LMBBQ(I try not to use another business' name in my reviews) and then there are all other BBQ places in Phoenix.  

I stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try, 2 years after the first time.  I was underwhelmed by the food that I tried.  I ordered the Po'Boy sandwich... a mountain of meat... sausage, brisket (chef's choice), and pulled pork.  The meat was far too saucy for me.  I do not care for sauce on my BBQ.  I prefer the sauce as a garnish,  on the side. I think it was added to the sandwich and I wish I had been asked. The sauce wasn't very tasty itself.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that I enjoy!  Same for the brisket.  The sausage on my sandwich didn't taste fresh,  so I didn't eat it more than a bite or two.   Rather unfortunate because I bet normally the regular sausage is good. 

The only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage I ordered on the side that, it JUST occurred to me, didn't taste like it was spiced with jalapeno, but black pepper.  Nevertheless,  the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good.   

i really would like to see BBQ places in and around Phoenix win, but this place is didn't satisfy my taste-buds.  For Phoenix, I suppose it meets some folks needs.  For me, its a \"do not return\", unless LMBBQ burns down.

Return Factor - 1%."}
