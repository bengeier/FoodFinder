{"text":"came with a groupon deal, very well worth it. but it looks like the actual price is a bit too high. we had:

appetizers:
Antipasti Il Mulino - i very much liked this one, very interesting flavours
Penne Pollo e Gamberi - shrimp pasta really... 

mains:
Lombata Di Vitello - this grilled veal was so tasty!! and huge in size, i had to pack half to go
Bistecca Mulino - i didn't try this, looked decent but nothing special

dessert:
Traditional Tiramisu - hubby said it's the best he had, i thought it was too bitter
Strudel Filled With Apple, Pear & Cranberry - this was very nice, but kind of like apple pie.... 

our server was so friendly so we had a good time. and they have a huge wine selection if you're interested."}
{"text":"I Went here after hearing it mentioned in a Drake song (I know, embarassing, it was Pound Cake with Jay-Z if you are curious). Il Mulino is a kind of throwback to great Italian restaurants of the past and provides a sense of nostalgia for its customers. Not trying to say this is for older people trying to avoid the slew of hipster restaurants blaring mashups of 80s hip hop with electro funk (what is that exactly again?)...but it kinda is. I ordered a lobster pasta with red sauce (very informative I know) but it was really good and I have no complaints. This is a place that I'm worried will be forgotten about and cast away like an old taekwondo star (Jean Claude Van Damnne?) who just couldn't keep up with the changing of the guard. Fortunately, shout outs on Drake records never hurt anyone so maybe this place will stick around. Moreover, considereing the aristocratic neighberhood it is located in, it might very well be a stretch that this place will ever struggle to stay in business. I guess im checking out Sotto Sotto next...

Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino

{"text":"My dinner at Il Mulino on Saturday night has to be one of my favourite dinners to date.  Everything from start to finish was impeccable.  The interior is simple and elegant, with detailed molding and candles lit on each table.  The staff were so pleasant and friendly, they really made the ambiance of the place one to remember.  Very New York little Italy white cloth dining feel.  I have driven by this place numerous times and never even knew it was there, and probably on purpose.  Very discreet and understated entrance, but the place was completely full with obvious regulars. My boyfriend and I dine out quite often (mostly in the downtown core) and are always looking for new places to experience.  He heard about this place by chance and decided to take me here for my birthday on Saturday.  I will never forget how amazing our night was.  The servers and host were so inviting and the food was near perfect; we had the Bolognese and the pasta di mare.  After Saturday night we both agreed that Il Mulino will now be one of our favourite dinner spots to frequent!  (worth the drive!!)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Thursday night. Went in with groupon deal (89 dollars for 3 course meal for 2). There was no separate menu for groupon-ers. We could choose anything from the menu. I had the grilled calamari while hubster had the anti-pasti platter. These were sizable portions. For mains, we chose rack of lamb as the smoked duck linguine. The duck was nicely done and left me wondering why I don't order duck more often. For dessert, we got the molten lava cake, which was fairly standard as well as the lemon deep dish pie, which was quite nice. 

The service was quite patchy. Initially quite good as we were one of three couples in the restaurants at 7:30pm. However, as the night progressed, there were only 2 waiters for up to 10 tables. There wasn't even a check in following the delivery of mains for salt&ground pepper. This definitely brought down the overall experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a nice meal without heading downtown. After some investigating we settled on II Mulino. 

Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and seated right away without a reservation. That's pretty much all that went well for the rest of the night. 

We sat and waited 20 minutes just to be greeted by our waiter. We waited another 10 minutes before we received any water or bread. To top it off that was the last time he even served us for the rest of the night. However, he was in the restaurant and served the table behind us quite thoroughly.  

We both decided on getting a three course meal with a bottle of wine, but after the wait we settled on just getting our mains, since we were pressed for time. My friend got a Risotto with mixed mushrooms and parmagiano, and he did enjoy it but wished the portions were a little bit bigger for the price. I had lingunie with chicken, spinach, tomato and shrimp. It was alright. Nothing mind blowing or to rave about. 

I really wanted to try some sort of dessert but after reading numerous reviews on how good the desserts are, but because of the lackluster service my friend and I gathered up enough cash to pay the bill and leave . Who knows how long we would have had to wait for a credit machine."}
{"text":"I bought a teambuy for this restaurant several weeks back and decided to go use it before it expired.

My first impression of the restaurant was very good!  It's a nice quaint little restaurant that was a little difficult for me to reach at first.  The ambiance was very nice.  It was dimly lit to give a nice romantic atmosphere.  Some might argue it was too dark but I found it to be just fine as I was on date with my gf.  This is definitely a dressy/classy restaurant without the huge crowd.

I ordered the Carpaccio Valtellina which had shavings of parmigiano cheese drizzled with lemon, arugula and extra virgin olive oil.  The beef was marinated nicely; added with the combination of the cheese,  and arugula complimented the overall flavour of this dish.  I certainly enjoyed this dish but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.

I tried my gf's appetizer the Calamari Amalfitani Grilled Calamari, Moroccan Black Olives, Fresh Tomatoes and Lemon juice in a White Wine Sauce.  This dish, I would have to say it was absolutely delicious.  I definitely wish I had ordered this as I felt the calamari was cooked to the perfect tenderness and marinated in a tomato was which was to die for.  Next time I come I'm ordering THAT!!!

My main course was the bison short rib which had some truffle oil which was beautifully presented!!  I had my doubts at first as I was using my teambuy coupon, but as soon as the waiter set the dish down I was blown away.  The bison short rib was marinated in a tasty sauce (don't know what sauce =( sorry) that wasn't overwhelming and tasted delicious!  I was glad that the chef added just the right amount of truffle oil so it didn't overpower the taste of the meat.  I had a side of sweet potato mash which normally I don't like but combining the sauce from the short rib with the sweet potato mash i found it to be quite pleasant.

For dessert I had a nice apple strudel that came with a vanilla bean gelato.  It was ok..  The pastry part of the strudel was a nice and crunchy and absorbed the flavour of the apple well... I'm not normally a dessert person but it was good nonetheless

Conclusion:

I would DEFINITELY come back here as a regular customer... the service was great!  food was great!  atmosphere was great!  what's not to like?  Quality of food served I would say is comparable to Auberge du pommier or North 44 except without the crowd.  This is my new favourite Italian restaurant and I would definitely recommend this hidden gem to anyone.

In other words.. The food here was like, sooo goood... like SOOO GOOD!!!.."}
{"text":"Second time we have been here.  Among the best Italian restaurants in Toronto.  

Their rosemary & olive oil focaccia /bread appetizer is absolutely delicious.

Grilled calamari (wonderfully flavourful, without being rubbery) had a delicious smoky flavour, and beef carpaccio appetizers also amazing. The carpaccio was a deft preparation of a classic dish: the beef was not bland but nicely spiced and set well against the lemon, oil and arugula notes. Very delicate and tasty!

The pastas are very flavourful (we had lobster linguine, gnocchi, and smoked duck with mushroom), and homemade, though not in-house. In our opinion both dishes displayed a depth of flavour and attention that would make them at home in any better Italian restaurant in Manhattan. For sure.

For entrees we also had the lamb and steak with Marsala sauce, and veal. the steak was maybe slightly over the requested medium rare, but it was no more than medium and the difference was not missed. Very good and flavourful beef. The sides were nothing to write home about but still good. The pastas by far are what you have to order, if you can't have both. 

The tiramisu for dessert was classic and well-made. 

We haven't been disappointed in our visits here.  We actually came here on a groupon (which is a steal considering the quality of the meal), but would readily come back for full-priced meal (albeit with mains on the pricey side).  

Staff were very attentive and with good sense of humour.  We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Terribly cold outside, but warm and welcoming inside! 
The decor is a hit, and the ambiance of an upscale Italian experience is terrific. Ornate, classic, white table cloths, a boisterous, noisy gathering place; very nice.
Service was authentic, personal, and friendly. Server and manager were attentive and made us feel like we were visiting old friends. 
The menu is quite extensive. Our appetizers included the sardines (quite a big serving; probably could be scaled back). Entrees included the daily fish (black cod; prepared beautifully, but for some reason wasn't a hit), and meat lasagna, which was great. Don't miss the tartufo for dessert!  Great wine list, although a smidge on the pricey side. 
Overall, a wonderful experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a list of Italian restaurants. More than I can remember. This is by far the best."}
{"text":"Came here for a lovely dinner last year. 

The service was fantastic and the staff were not only friendly but also helpful.  The setting was dimly lit and comfortable with some ambient noise--just enough to enjoy private conversations at the table.

The food was delicious and priced as such for a place of such quality.

I will add that it was not a groupon dinner although I would imagine the groupon dinner would be just as good.  A great idea if you want to try the establishment on a budget!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with my mom for the first time and ordered from their Summerlicious menu.  The place was pretty full when we arrived at 7pm and filled up completely by the time we left at 9pm.  The service was nice and our waiter was a lovely gentleman who was attentive despite how busy it was.  We were both very satisfied with the quality of food and the portions they gave.  

We ordered their steamed mussels in tomato broth to start, lobster linguini as our mains, and tiramisu for dessert.  They served us bread drizzled with olive oil and rosemary, which was excellent for dipping into the broth after eating all the yummy mussels!  

I will definitely go there again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"came here for my boyfriends birthday and they made it fabulous.

if you mention the dineto special they let you and your date each choose an app, entree and dessert for $89.  This was such a good deal considering just one app, two entrees and one dessert would have been over $90 anyways.

The portions were just right, the quality of food was spectacular and the overall atmosphere was lovely.

I would definitely recommend this place, esp for special dinners. Man i'm practically drooling writing this review."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is fantastic. The restaurant its self I found a litter dark. 
Follow my 2 step program for an amazing experience.
Step 1: order the smoked duck linguine 
Step 2: thank me later

The duck is even more succulent than poppy could have hoped"}
{"text":"Bought the groupon and was dreading poor service, but service was great throughout... partially because we had a fantastic waiter! Wine was on the pricey side but the waiter suggested an excellent bottle that paired well with our meal and didn't break the bank.  The beef carpaccio was just ok but the mushroom risotto was phenomenal!  We had the veal for our main which was flavourful but I could have used a larger portion of veggies/ whatever side to compliment the steak.. The cheesecake was very good as was the molten lava cake though my opinion is biased as I would eat anything erupting with chocolate.  Cons: The lighting a little too dim and quite a small space so not fantastic if you are claustrophobic or ummmm large..."}
{"text":"We've been to Il Mulino 5 or 6 times, but this time we found out the resto had been sold in March.  I'm happy to say that the food is still wonderful and the staff is excellent.  Victor is still there and he's very good to us.  We met the new owner, who also owns Il Posto in Yorkville, and his son.  As for food -- we split our appetizers: half lobster and the calamari, and then split gnocchi and seabass, with molten chocolate cake w gelato for dessert. It was delicious.  Very nice ambiance in the resto; very pretty."}
{"text":"After reading all the lovely reviews, I decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday. Even though it was a Wednesday night, it was bustling and loud in the dimmed restaurant.

We ordered the anti pasti Il Mulino, the duck linguine and the seafood risotto. The shrimp and calamari in the anti pasti was really tasty, and the proscuitto was great as well. The duck linguine was delicious. The seafood risotto was a little undercooked in my opinion, and it was good but not fabulous. 

The reason I am giving them only 3 stars even though the food was good, is because I am not impressed with the service we experienced. When we asked for plain water, the server brought us a bottle of overpriced mineral water, he clearly did not try to clarify whether we wanted tap or not and took us for suckers. Near the end of dinner, we found out there was a \"special menu\" and we were never presented that at all. And after they had collected our plates, they neither asked us whether we would like to see the dessert menu oor if we would like the bill, and instead left us to sit there. 

I had expected better from Il Mulino. I don't think I will recommend it, nor will I return."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon - what a great deal! We ate some fantastic food and received some fantastic service (which isn't always there when you dine Groupon-style because I'm guessing people forget that you should tip on the full value of the meal and not the Groupon itself).The restaurant itself has a great ambiance, dim-lit and nicely decorated.

- The starter bread is crispy and delectable, unlike any I have ever had at an Italian restaurant. It's drizzled with olive oil and herbs. Sooo yummy!

- For apps, we shared the gnocchi & the antipasti plate. Both were really good! I especially liked the seafood (calamari & shrimp) on the antipasti plate. 

- For mains, we had the lobster linguine and the rack of lamb. Both were delicious. The lamb was somehow a little bit crispy on the outside but the inside was melt-in-your-mouth good! A perfect balance.

- Desserts were tiramisu and the cheesecake. Both were delicious but I especially loved the tiramisu.

We were talking to the owner and he was telling us how they buy everything locally to support neighbouring businesses which I thought was great. Everyone who worked there was really friendly and attentive. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Drive to uptown was worth it. It's pricey, but you get amazing, unique food. We ordered some seafood pasta dish and a variety of apps. It was better than our expectations and the wait was worth it. The decor of the place is very nice and romantic. It's a small restaurant and it was packed when we went there.  Would definitely go again. 

Value - 8/10
Service - 9/10
Environment - 9/10 romantic
Portion size - 8/10"}
{"text":"We came on a Groupon in December for my husband's birthday.  We somehow (by either a blunder or a happy coincidence) went during Hannukah, which meant, given the neighbourhood, that it was absolutely dead.  There was one other couple who left midway through our meal.  So we had the waitstaff all to ourselves and they did not disappoint.  They were attentive and chatty (and yet knew when we wanted to just be on our own) and very helpful.  Ambiance was very romantic, like a little bistro.

We shared appetizers (mussels and caprese salad).  When I ordered the mussels, they asked if we wanted them how they were on the menu, because the chef would do them however we wanted!  I chose to deviate and they were perfectly done to order!  Very pampered!  The bread is TO DIE FOR, it's a house-made rosemary foccacia that was SO GOOD, it's unreal.  We asked for seconds, then thirds!!!!  For the mains, I had the leg of lamb and my husband had a steak.  They were succulent and tasty and perfectly seasoned.  The sides paired well with both (mashed garlic potatoes and seasonal veggies, though not entirely seasonal, since its December in Toronto).  In any case, wonderful.

For dessert, my husband had the molten chocolate cake and I had the tartufo.  Both were the perfect size and decadent and wonderful.

Overall, zero complaints, we wouldn't hesitate to return.  It was the perfect birthday gift!!!"}
{"text":"I came here last year after reading reviews on Yelp, and oh boy! This restaurant definitely showed me what \"real service\" meant.

At first, we were seated at a quiet corner. The atmosphere was quiet and calm, although all the tables were taken. A short while later, we were asked to be reseated to the middle of the restaurant because an old couple wanted our seats. It actually didn't matter much to me since I was there mainly for the food, but from there on, we were treated like royalty. I especially appreciated the manager coming out to apologize and offer us extras for the night. 

Now onto the food.. We ordered a pear puree soup for the appetizer. It was very light and certainly something I've never tried before. However, you could still taste the pear. This refreshing appetizer was fantastic.

For the main course, we ordered the Linguine all'Anatra. A small size, but perfect for a small girl like myself. The duck was nice and soft and it sat on top of a flavorful linguine. Pleasant as it is, I think there are better Italian dishes.

Finally, we ordered the cheesecake special. I loved the texture of the cake. It was thinly layered, unlike regular cheesecake. The mixed berry sauce wasn't too sour either. 

If I were to make any criticisms, it would be to turn up the lights just a tad bit. Near the end of the dinner, I found myself full, but also barely awake!"}
{"text":"Nice place but I expected service to be a bit better for such an established restaurant. The hostess must have been new. She took us all over the small restaurant before seating us. The waiter was good. The food was kind of flavourless. But the calamari appetizer was pretty good. I don't think I will go again or recommend it to anyone. Many other much better restaurants."}
{"text":"After a late meeting the other night, my friend offered to take me to dinner. As I was tired and I LOVE to eat, I was no match for any sort of argument. I had a craving for some really good Italian and initially thought of a few swanky places downtown, but being a Monday night, there were very few options at 10pm where one would not feel like a total ass for keeping the wait staff holed up at work any longer than they need to be. Thanks to the crappy weather we were having (hail in late-April, that is), I wanted to eat closer to my 'hood so that I could jet home afterwards. We ended up checking out Il Mulino as a result. Funnily enough, it seems bad weather has brought other reviewers to the place!  

I am so grateful that Il Mulino is close to my house!! All the raves of other reviewers here are so right! A fine meal and impeccable, old-school service made me forget my long day and the shitty weather outside. 

We shared the generous house antipasti platter which included a few grilled items on top of greens alongside a mini serving of caprese: calamari, shrimp (two of these would have been nice), cured meat, and mushrooms with a ratatouille-type mix of tomatoes, herbs, olives, etc--so yummy! Their risotti are also pretty amazing (friend had the al funghi version) and I can tell you that their grilled seabass is also a must! It was a whole fish griled with herbs, along with your choice of I can't remember what but I opted for the grilled vegs (roasted then fried potato, braised carrot and greens). I am pretty sure I would have wet my pants if the skin were crispy, but alas, it wasn't. 

Our host and server, Astrit, treated us like we were friends stopping by. He was a real sweetheart who chatted with us for some time. I love this type of personal service and it's the kind of thing one remembers that keeps you going back (besides such good food!). I was surprised on the one hand that Il Mulino is associated with Sotto Sotto as pointed out by one reviewer, mainly because it doesn't seem to be too well known outside the area, yet it's not that odd when you consider how good the food is! Everything about the food was just right: flavours, portions... 
 
In a word, I would describe the food as 'comforting'. The ambience is nice, clientele seeming to be mostly from the area. Some may consider the prices high but the labour that goes into the food, the quality of ingredients, and such amicable service are apparent justifications. Il Mulino could easily make for a nice date spot, a family dinner, groups/celebrations. I was impressed by the lack of pretension and snobbery that one could expect at such a place. As relaxed as it was though, I would suggest that you put some effort into throwing yourself together somewhat if you plan to dine here."}
{"text":"Went because of a groupon.  Food was alright.  Pasta was on the salty side, both my dish and my hubby.  Ordered lamb chops as the main.  Not sure if it was sinew or fat, but I found it hard to eat/chew.  Service was not impressive.  Waiter took our order and we didn't see him again until end of the night.  All the food was brought out and cleared by runners.  At the end of the night, the waiter comes with our bill, proceeds to condescendingly explain it - including the addition of an automatic gratuity.  Note: there's only two of us, not a large party of 8+.  Methinks Il Mulino does this to ensure tips for groupons, while providing sub-par service.
Overall, poor experience. Okay food does not make up for snotty service."}
{"text":"Hands down our favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto- warm and welcoming service, excellent food, fantastic sommelier!"}
{"text":"Went there again few days ago and wasn't disappointed at all.
Not sure if it's me or the portions got smaller somehow. Nevertheless, I was full after I ate everything.
Service was still on a great level and the waiter was passing by occasionally to see how we're doing.
The Sea Bass was really delicious. Can't wait to try something else next time."}
{"text":"I suggested this place based on reading City Bites magazine and finding out Sotto Sotto owners run this restuarant.  After reading the yelp review from the out of towners, I figured let's try it out

So I will start with the negative.  My friend made a reservation using Open Table and his reservation did not show up.  Ok now that's out of the way, we had excellent service from start to finish.  All of us ordered glasses of wine through their expansive list.  While waiting to order we had their bread which was in olive oil and herbs.  VERY VERY tasty.  We all agreed in getting their prix fixe menu for $39.  It was a choice of Caesar or garden salad, gnocchi and a choice of veal, chicken or beef and a choice of dessert.  Gnocchi is generally heavy but it is made fresh because it was very soft and melted in your mouth.  It was a very small portion but it worthwhile.  As for the veal, MY GOD!!! One of the best veal dishes I've had.  All of us ordered creme brulee, apple strudel and the molten lava chocolate dessert.  Exquisite.   My gf, friends and I all enjoyed our experience there.

As a side note, one server came over and told us the Habs-Pens score and the other server talked \"calcio\" with me, even though he was a Napoli fan.  But at least they were sports fans, which made my night."}
{"text":"It's just so good! Old school New York style service and delectable dishes. I've never had anything here that disappoints. Try the veal, the steak, the pasta, risotto, mussels, salads and dessert. Honestly I'm drooling!

Definitely on the pricey side but a great place to catch up with old friends or lovers. And a superb wine list to boot. I've had one of my favorite wines ever here, not available at the LCBO, so I find myself there time and time again for the food, service, wine and company. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"They charge you a 20% tip because apparently \"its confusing\" to people when they see a bill. Not only are you ripping me off. NOT ONLY DID i not see the server the entire service, youre also insulting me stating i would be too confused to tip myself."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 

As soon as we walked we were greeted by the nicest man and the biggest smile! We were sat down and the menu was read to us. The place wasn't too busy (a Thursday night) and our amazing servers (Astrit and Victor) made sure we were taken care of and were very entertaining and accommodating and the friendliest people I have met at a restaurant. 
We had the risotto (best ever) and the duck meat (first time I have had duck meat and was not disappointed at all). We were told about the perfect wine that went VERY well with our food. Finally ended the night with tiramisu!

Overall a great night, because of the AMAZING food and even better workers!
Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"The best Italian resturant in Toronto . Everything is delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because of Drake songs. There is Forest-Hill-neighbourhood nostalgia about this pricey-place, but as a non-local, I would be hard-pressed to choose it again given the better options in Toronto.

Had some grilled octopus, carpaccio to start and linguine with truffle sauce. A dirty martini or two. Our servers were career waiters, who were very accommodating.

But, for this price (over $250 for two), in Toronto, you can get more than the usual assembled pasta dishes. You can get a chef with inspired visions for food. You can get small works of delicious art. This place does not do that.

Il Mulino does regular Italian food very competently. Therefore, the restaurant was a mix of well-to-do families having a regular meal, and super-dressed up couples having anniversary dinners."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago and I fell in love, a great place to bring your significant other or if you're looking for more of a romantic/intimate setting. 

For dinner I had the linguine all'anatra which features smoked duck, mushrooms in  jus cream sauce. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! Not a usual fan of duck but il mulino has got me converted. The smokiness of the duck almost had it tasting like something else, it was the best duck I've ever eaten. A great option is that you can order any main in an appetizer portion in case you're a light eater! 

As read in other reviews, it is highly recommended to make reservations ahead of time as there is limited seating. I visited on a Monday and it was nearly packed!"}
{"text":"I came to Il Mulino with a WagJag voucher in hand for a four-course prix fixe menu for 2.

The wines here are expensive $13.95 for a glass of 6 oz. Cabernet Sauvignon that I didn't think was a great wine.  

The food at Il Mulino was very good, though attention to detail needs to improve as I was brought my soup without a spoon to drink it with and my order of cappuccino was totally forgotten about until I asked about it.  I had already finished my dessert by the time it finally came. Also, no bread basket?  And I doubt they do this to regular customers, but an automatic 17% gratuity was added to my bill.  That didn't sit well with me.  But in their defense, they charged 1% less than what Toronto Life magazine standard of 18% being the norm.  

The 10 oz. striploin was the standout of the evening with a nice char and a great grilled flavour to it.  They know how to cook a great steak!  Their gnocchi is also pretty amazing (they have a cream sauce or tomato sauce option).  Pillowy-soft and the tomatoes were extremely fresh.

One of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at and if it weren't for the little details I would've given it a full 5 stars.  If you're promoting your restaurant, the worst thing you could do is count the pennies.  At the end of the day, I think the prices are a little inflated for what it is."}
{"text":"So far, the best resturant I've been to in Toronto.
BF and I decided to pre-valentines day here (as real valentines day usually means crowds, sub par service, and set menus). 
Intimately small, and a little loud due to the Saturday night crowd, but I think the boisterous laughter from surrounding tables added a bit of character to our night out.

Started with a half bottle of wine reccomended by the server. 

Restaurant bread with olive oil... fresh and quite good, but unmemorable compared to the rest of the meal, so don't fill up on it!

Appetizers: 
Muscles in spicy tomato broth - amazing, fresh, flacourful
beet Salad - fresh, but not memorable

Main:
Rack of lamb- amazing, medium rare to order. Reduction sauce (port?) was perfectly fitting. 
Spigola- baked, which is my favourite. Herb crust was fantastic, with a bright flavour and crisp texture to compliment the denser fish. The accompanying rosti seemed a little soggy, but didn't drastically affect my opinion... well paired, execution could have been better.  

Dessert: 
Tiramisu- traditional, not too boozy, high custard to sponge ratio (my preference, though BF would have liked more sponge).
Cheesecake with blueberry reduction- dense, rather than the fluffy style, so, although very tasty, maybe just not for me.

Wonderful, friendly (but still appropriate) attentive service, with a little lesson about Italian wines.

The epitome of sophisticated, old-school italian- I'd go back to Il Mulino any day."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant for a dinner while on a trip in Toronto based on the yelp reviews as well as its Zagats rating and I wasn't let down. Food, service and ambiance were excellent. Portions were well sized and the dining experience overall was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and helped pair a wine that went well with our meals. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday night for dinner. Place was packed with what I could tell from the 'special' menus were folks with coupons. The 4 course prix fix dinner was offered with plenty of choices for every course to suit almost all palates.

Service was quick, responsive and friendly despite the crowd. Cutlery was replaced with every course and water was refilled fairly regularly. Wait time between meals was reasonable, not very short but also not very long. The ambience is quite decent, romantic and kind of cozy I guess but the tables are plenty roomy and a decent distance apart.

Highlights were the excellent Risotto, the decent Striploin Steak and very creamy Gelato. On the other hand the Gnocchi was very blah... The Sea Bass and the Panna Cotta were actually below average.

Overall food is decent but I wouldn't personally go back for the regular price menu as, despite good, solid service, the dishes lack refinement or for lack of a better word, a 'punch'.

With the coupon though, I'd definitely give this joint a shot again."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant as the ratings here on Yelp were so high! However, I was very disappointed by my experience. Coming here on a Tuesday night, it was quiet, with only two other tables. The decor was nice and cozy. The service was great. What was terrible though, was the food! The risotto I had for appetizer was incredibly salty, the fish for my main was greasy to the point that oil was dripping and my cheese platter at the end featured a very disappointing selection - and this is coming from who LOVES cheese! I didn't finish my main or my cheese platter. 

Needless to say, i am surprised by the amazing 4.5 overall rating for Il Mulino. I came here expecting an amazing meal. I had a groupon, but even then, it was not worth the price - we ended up paying an extra $60 in tax (+ 2 glasses of wine) on top of the groupon price. There are far too many other places with better food for a similar price. I feel like the promotional groupon of this restaurant duped a lot of people into thinking the food is good - there was no way that the food in the quality that was served to me, could've garnered such high ratings."}
{"text":"great service, great intimate little restaurant...
of course food was good, well portioned, fettuccine bolognese, galetto al maltone, but for some reason, i can't say it was memorable.. was great, but .....why?? i don't know... i wasn't wowed... maybe try different dish next time..."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and every time is a treat. The restaurant is romantic and the staff is super accommodating and and makes your visit super romantic and cute. 

The restaurant also has lots of promotions going on all the time (Summerlicious, Groupon etc.) so the price isn't even that expensive if you time your visit well. 

I've tried the risotto, lamb, mussels, and steak here. Everything's well done but I must say that the mussels and lamb are my favourite dishes so far. 

Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came back to the resto for my bf's bday, I made reservations with them and made sure to tell them I had a deal. They didn't talk to me any differently or change of attitude either. (Some restaurants can be a bit judgey when it comes to deal vouchers). We got there around 6. Restaurant was pretty much empty. The servers are great, the customer service never changed since our first visit. Very attentive and quick to move dishes to next course. 
We ordered : anti pasto platter + seafood risotto
Mains: rack of lamb + braised short rib
Dessert: chocolate lava cake + cheesecake
Drinks: two glasses of white wine

The service and the food is what keeps bringing us back. We're a big fan of this restaurant and recommend it to everyone we know."}
{"text":"I work along Eglinton and decided to give this restaurant a try due to their five star rating on yelp. When I walked in, I wasn't greeted or asked to be seated. I had to wave to catch the attention of one of the waiter who told us to wait for five mins. I was seated and it looks like they were short of staff because there was only three waiters. All my courses took forever to arrive and it took three hours for me to finish dinner ( I am quite a fast eater). We ended up leaving the place nearly 11pm. And everyone was too tired and exhausted to have a good time"}
{"text":"You have got to try the Insalata di Funghi, it is probably the best arugala salad I've ever had! For my main I had the Gnocchi with the basil tomato sauce, nothing too special about that but it was still good. My date was very happy with the Spigola alla Griglia and he is hard to impress when it comes to food."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Ordered for pickup, treated incredibly was offered drinks and they treated me as if I were a sitting customer. I brought my food home and it was absolutely specular! I was full from the yummy bread but wanted to continue eating! It is pricey but very much worth the price! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Modern white-table-cloth kind of place.  To see the place empty, as they are preparing for dinner, it might appear a bit stuffy.  However as you are greeted by the staff and often the proprietor himself, you quickly feel the warmth of the place.  Great for couples, but also for gatherings of close friends.  The E2E experience is fantastic, from greeting to appetizer to after-dinner drink."}
{"text":"It was cold and snowy outside when we visited this restaurant, but the welcome was warm and inviting and the decor is tasteful and simple.  Il Mulino is always a busy place, but it never feels stuffy or full, just happy, intimate and bustling.
Although we visited this beautiful Italian restaurant during winterliscious, we ordered off the regular menu.  I started with a caesar salad (a delicious staple) followed by a perfectly cooked mushroom risotto in a creamy white wine sauce. Both were executed perfectly, and all others at the table were just as pleased with their meals as well.  My husband ordered a heaping portion of lasagna, which he was thrilled with. I didn't try them myself, but am told the mussels were tasty as well.
Wine selection was pretty good, with a nice selection of well-priced wines.
Will definitely continue frequenting this satisfying and consistent place! I rarely give a 5 but I think the effort really shines, from the great staff to outstanding service and of course, the food!"}
{"text":"My husband & I decided to have our Valentine's dinner last night to avoid the set menus offered by most restaurants on Valentine's day.  We had originally chosen & made a reservation at Blu but then chose Il Mulino based on its fantastic reviews & menu choices.  My husband & I were really looking forward to this dinner & a chance to have a quiet evening alone together.

The restaurant's decor IS very nice.  The arched ceiling & chandeliers make it a beautiful location for special occasions & the tables being well spaced apart makie it a lovely spot for couples to have a romantic dinner.  We arrived at 7:30 p.m. and were, at that point, one of six couples in the place.  

Our waiter, Fernando, promptly came to our table with a basket of  a delicious Rosemary toasted bread.  We decided to order a bottle of wine to accompany our meal.  Their selection of wines was vast offering many choices from different regions around the world.  The Italian red wine list alone was nine pages long though most bottles were over $100.  We decided on  the 2010 Chianti \"Riserva\" Sensi ($67) which was perfect for our dinner choices of  Agnello del Fornaio  $44.95 (Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb in a Pommery Mustard Sauce) & Lombata Di Vitello $38.95 (12 oz Grilled Veal Chop with Roasted Shallots & Port Reduction).  

We started our meal splitting the appetizer Mozzarella e Pomodori
$16.95  (Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, Vine Ripened Tomatoes and Fresh Basil Drizzled with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and a Balsamic Reduction).  It was very good BUT we were quite surprised at the portion size,   Considering the price, we were expecting more than three small slices of tomato & cheese.  A disappointing start to an even more disappointing meal to come.

After some time, our main course arrived.  The vegetables were done to perfection & the sauces on both the veal & lamb were delicious.  Although both meats had a nice flavour, both were rather tough & the lamb was underdone.  I asked for medium rare but some parts of my lamb were almost raw while the rest was very rare.  If the waiter had bothered to come back to the table & asked how our meals were, we would have mentioned it but at that point the restaurant was getting very busy & we were having a hard time flagging him down.  We were starting to feel ignored & quite frankly invisible, not something one expects at a restaurant of this calibre.

At around 9 p.m. we asked for a dessert menu.  And yes, we had to flag the waiter down to ask as we were still being ignored.  I ordered a cappuccino & chocolate biscotti & my husband also ordered a biscotti,  The waiter brought my cappuccino  & after about 15 minutes we wondered whether he had forgotten about the biscotti.  I had wanted to have the biscotti with my cappuccino which by that time I had finished.  The waiter said it would be out soon but that it takes time?  At that point I assumed they must be baking the biscotti fresh or that they presented it in some special manner.  Moments later the waiter brought the two biscottii,  They were nothing special, similar to biscotti one gets from Starbucks.  Perhaps they needed time to thaw?

By 9:30 p.m. we had had enough so asked for the bill.  We dine out a lot & usually leave at least a 20% tip.  When we choose to dine at a finer establishment, we expect a level of service to match.  We did not get that level of service so tipped accordingly,   

The evening had started out great but quickly went downhill.  As we left I felt very upset that we had just spent over $200 of our hard earned money on a mediocre dinner & poor service.  I know this restaurant gets rave reviews & maybe we just hit it on a bad night.  In any case, we won't  be back anytime soon.  

Thanks Il Mulino for making this years Valentine's dinner one we would rather forget!"}
{"text":"I had an unreal dinner here, and I don't say that often. In true high end cuisine, I'd grade this a little lower. Maybe a 4/5, BUT I'm not in NY Or London, I'm a walk away from a really great meal. 
Took my wife for our anniversary and fortunately the place wasn't packed. Had some wonderful appetizers and mains. Zero complaints. Great wine list and if you go by the glass, your meal will be $200 tip (20%) and tax included for two.  Yum yum. Oh, we didn't have desert. We were too full!"}
{"text":"We had a delightful time. Though I'm not convinced our waiter's Italian accent was real. . ."}
{"text":"Nice presentation, great wine list in the his & her BMW part of town. Authentic ingredients appreciated with a great Olive oil and balsamic paired together for the best Caprese Salad. Thanks for making the extra effort, loved the experience!"}
{"text":"Get:
Caesar Salad
Whole grilled fish special
Veal, mushroom, Parmesan"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. I've had better pasta. 

Although it is in a more affluent area of Toronto, because of the drake song, it attracts many tween girls. There was a a table of 9 girls beside me celebrating a pre-legal birthday....all because of drizzy drake."}
{"text":"I get really confused by this place. Is it related to the Il Mulino in NYC and Las Vegas? They have similar font and such on their websites...But the service at the LV and NYC locations blow this place out of the water if so.

Extremely slow service from an extremely slow server. I overheard several times from him while he went to tables that another server was sick, etc etc. 
Still no reason why 3 tables around us got their apps and mains before we even got our apps. Very disappointed.

Mozzarella e Pomodori is saving the day on this review, an excellent starter.
Bistecca Mulino was not seasoned very well, and was a bit dry.

Too bad, as the LV Il Mulino (if they even are related) was one of the finest dining experiences i have had."}
{"text":"My boss took me here once and i can't stop thinking about it. 

It's nestled in the bathurst and eglinton area, and is a non descript gem. 
This is an elegant and simple Italian food restaurant with an excellent excellent excellent wine list. I highly recommend the place. A little pricey (about $60- $80 per head) but well worth it for the level of service and quality of food. The place is intimate and friendly. The managers and servers all give you attention and the restaurant is small so it feels like you belong. 

If you're confused about the wine, ask the sommelier. If you are unsure about something, ask the server. I sometimes expect a level of arrogance at restaurants like this, but i found none here. I was torn between the ahi, beef or octopus carrpacio, so the house made me a trio platter without me even asking!

Really where do you get service like this in Toronto anymore? 

I love the place and recommend it for small groups (2, 3 or 4) just because of the intimacy factor.

If you take a date here, she/he will be impressed with you. If you take your family here, they will thank you. If you take out of town guests here, they will appreciate the high level of food and service canada has to offer!"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare times where five stars totally fails to capture the greatness that is Il Mulino. 

The food was magnificent - and by that I mean ridiculously good.  But it was much more than just the food.  The owner, Oscar, was gracious and welcoming.  The atmosphere is romantic and intimate.  The service was, in a word, perfect.  The evening when taken in totality was amongst the most enjoyable I can remember.

First - the food...

My wife had heard great things about the gnocchi, but could not decide if she wanted the marinara or the four-cheese.  Oscar's solution - we will do it \"two-ways\".  Wow.  They should put that option on the menu!  Visually it was beautiful.  And the taste?!?  INCREDIBLE!!!  The gnocchi was so fresh and the two sauces kept the taste fresh and enjoyable.  Oh, and she loved her beet salad.

For me?  The octopus special was a great appetizer, but the star of the show was the calamari appetizer - which looked so good that I ordered as a second course fully expecting to have the veal.  Well, let's just say that plans changed upon having my first bite.  Words cannot describe how incredible their calamari tastes.  I was immediately swept back to several small Mediterranean villages where the grill their morning's catch with nothing but sea salt, EVOO and lemon.  Oscar adds a perfect chunky tomato, garlic and black olive topping and I was in heaven.

I was a little embarrassed, but I had to order a second portion.  And I would have had a third if I could have managed room.

The service also merit mentioning.  It is rare to walk into a new restaurant and immediately feel like family.  The entire staff made us feel at home while still respecting our romantic evening. 

We left not only wanting more, but planning our next trip to Toronto if only to come back."}
{"text":"Went for the summerlicious with a vegetarian girl friend. I would have personally rated it a 4 but then the gf's main was terrible. I had a bit and it definitely was sub par for an average, casual place so since it was served here I was disappointed that the \"celebration\" meal wasn't as good for the lady friend.

The dessert did give her a happier ending to the meal though. Mine was pretty good, the lobster linguine as they gave a big portion and even half a lobster. Service could have been better but it was still a nice dinner.

Oh right and the setting and atmosphere was really romatic / cozy so that was a plus."}
{"text":"I visited Il Mulino a few months ago and I was over the moon about how great everything was. I had a groupon voucher that entitled us to 3-course dinner for two. We got to choose whatever we wanted off the menu with no restrictions (I highly recommend using groupons when trying out a new place). The food was fantastic, everything tastes great and came out in a timely manner. We were very satisfied. 

The decor is very nice. It's a smaller sized venue, with darker \"mood lighting\", it's all very romantic and very Italian. I really really enjoyed it, it makes for a great date spot but I did see families with children here too. 

The staff was probably one of my favourite parts of the experience. The waiters were absolutely amazing! They interacted with us, cracked jokes with us and ultimately made us feel very comfortable and at ease which impacted our overall experience very positively! 

I would definitely come back to Il Mulino again, I had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Right when we entered, we received the WARMEST welcome! The food we ordered was delicious and recommend the risotto ai funghi, Linguine all'Anatra, and tiramisu. The server, Astrik (sp?) and Victor were phenomenal with customer service. Not a flawed first experience in any way. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a very lovely meal at Il Mulino, a hidden gem tucked in Eglinton and Bathurst. The interior was warm and intimate, a perfect setting for a romantic dinner with your loved one. We were greeted very warmly by an Italian gentleman, who thoughtfully asked us for our seating preference.

We were served some flat bread dressed with rosemary and drizzles of olive oil. This bread was amazingly addictive, particularly that lovely, crunchy crust. we finished two servings of it on top of our meal. 

The meat lasagna was utterly delectable! The flavours were very robust and the texture of the pasta sheets was wonderful- not too mushy but adequately soft. I wanted to lick the whole plate clean.

In comparison, the other pasta fell a little short. I wanted something simple, so I opted for an appetizer portion of gnocchi quattro formaggio: grana padano and ricotta in a four cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was rather bland, perhaps because I had tasted the lasagna first. I also thought it could use a little more salt. I was really looking forward to a more pungent cheesy taste (after all, it had four cheeses!), but that didn't really come through. However, the lasagna was so good that I could easily forgive this dish.

For dessert, the tiramisu was very tasty. It had perhaps a little too much cream for me, but the flavours were excellent and not overly sweet. 

The service was just wonderful. When our server missed us leaving the restaurant, he even ran out the door to bid us farewell. Next time I come, I would definitely call ahead to find out whether meat lasagna is on their menu that day."}
