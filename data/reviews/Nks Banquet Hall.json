{"text":"So this Banquet hall is actually located in Kennedy Square or Peach Tree plaza. It is absolutely HUGE and you would have never have expected it to be so big.. you can't tell at all that this is there in the plaza. It's located in the corner and for the longest time i did not know such a huge establishment existed. 

I've recently had both dim sum and dinner there. The dinner is better than the dim sum. The dim sum is okay. Not the best but it's not bad. The prices are fair and the food is alright. The benefits of this place is that the restaurant is HUGE. The wait for dim sum is minimal and seating for big parties is great here! 

My family is pretty big so we'll continue to come back, but hopefully the food improves a little."}
{"text":"Food NOT fresh. Also a disgrace to have a wedding here, considering this is a banquet. They need a renovation big time. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot with my family but unfortunately the service and food quality here have been going downhill! They seem to be more understaffed than ever before and it takes really long to flag a waiter/waitress down. They've also recently raised the prices on their regular dim sum (now $3.38 all day) as well as special dim sum items ($4.99+). Their menu is more condensed now too and some items that I used to order are now no longer available... disappointing. Time to look for other options in the area..."}
{"text":"This place is large and spacious! Lots of tasty treats all around! 

All of our food that came out in the baskets were steaming hot! Only few selections of food when waiters walk around with food carts, the rest is ordered on a sheet of paper. 

Very hard to find parking spot in busy times, so I'd suggest coming a little early.

As for the food - LOTS of food to pick from, even if you're a picky eater, there's something on the menu that I'm sure you'd like. The food all came out fresh and quick!

The servers don't talk much but are still fairly helpful when asked for help."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum lunch today, haven't been in over a year and they have changed management. 

The great thing about coming here, is the size of the place.  You rarely have to wait for a table or the wait is quite minimal.  The walls have all been whitewashed and all wall decorations have been removed.  The stage has been altered to the opposite side of the  restaurant, to where it used to be.

The food was ok, nothing great but nothing really bad.  At $2.98 per S,M or L dish, you can't really complain.  Early bird special is before 11am, and is $2.68 per S, M or L dish.  The dim sum used to come out on trolleys/carts but they have been abolished.  Only saw 1 congee cart.  The food is now brought to the table on trays.  I personally, prefer the carts, rather than placing the whole serving tray on your table.  But times are changing and most restaurants serve like this now.  The hot water for the tea, wasn't very hot.  

Overall, not a bad place for dim sum, less noisy than a lot of places.  But I personally, prefer the hustle, bustle and atmosphere of noisier places.  If you want a nice chit chat then it's better here."}
{"text":"It's extremely average. The oil to deep fry was old and the deep fried shrimp balls weren't \"bouncy\" in texture. However the tea was good."}
{"text":"Dim sum with the family on a Sunday morning. This is a banquet hall turned restaurant!

Personally I found it very chaotic and confusing. We were seated in the back because our party was 15 people. There is a large lazy Susan in the middle of the table for easy access to all food items. Still, I personally found it very chaotic and odd setup. We ordered our food but the people with carts still came to our table with items. Some of the waiters told us \"yes, you ordered this\" but ended up getting double orders of some items. Luckily our party was large so we finished everything!  The food quality was good and I thought all the items were well flavoured. The calamari was my favourite but they had a lot of variety and things I have not tried before! Lots of fried food, lots.

I would image having someone that can read Chinese/Mandarin would make things easier but the menu is in English. Just might be easier communicating with the food runners! 

For our table the bill was $157 which included taxes I thought it was a great experience but I personally would not go back!"}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good. Or maybe it was the early tips. I was going to a Chinese banquet and usually \"red envelopes\" are given to the servers early on prior to paying and giving regular tips. 

I'm not the biggest fan of the full 9 course Chinese meals. So I wasn't expecting much. I usually only eat the roasted pork, which comes at the beginning of the feast. Then I wait for about 3 dishes later for the chicken. The 2 meats I had were well done. Not overly dry. My husband and friend from the states (who has not had this kind of feast before) said it was alright. Nothing too spectacular. 

The restaurant itself is inside of the Peachtree plaza. The decor is very average. White walls and a standard small stage area with the Phoenix and Dragon design. 
Relatively clean. 

I might go back to try their dim sum, but for a banquet, probably not."}
{"text":"This place was formerly known as \"Mong Kok Chinese Restaurant\" and it was a full push-cart dim sum place (all dim sum pushed on carts). It was relatively decent and good service.

Now they use a paper-form ordering system, along with some carts that mostly carry deserts or high-profit margin items they want to peddle you with. Unfortunately, with the new system they are quite buggy, slow and sometimes forgetting items. 

There's a few paper-form ordering dim sum places in the GTA that does better in terms of speed, quality and price. I was only willing to pay a premium before, because of the full push-cart system, so I will not be returning anymore."}
{"text":"Many of these less fancy dim sum places usually end up with lower Yelp scores. Doesn't matter though. It's not the millennial \"foodies\" that will keep them thriving. It's the grannies who drag their millennial grandchildren to dim sum brunch on weekends. I mean, that's what my grandma does to me with Nks. And I LIKE it. 

Food-wise, the stuff here is actually pretty decent. Take a look at the shots I took. No filter needed. Smooth and plump shrimp rice rolls, glistening egg tarts, nicely glazed BBQ pork buns. But these guys aren't all looks, no substance. Sure, with every place, you'll have weaker dishes, but it's quite tasty overall. 

For dinner, I just got a chance to take part in the $98 dinner special. The amount of food we got, at such great quality, at THAT price? Unbelievable. Included Peking duck, fried ribs, steamed fish, poached chicken with lots of ginger/green onion oil, bean sprout leaves, and dessert (tofu pudding or sweet mung bean soup). ALL of it was delicious. Seriously, what a steal. We had 5 people and plenty of leftovers. 

Sure, they're probably not going to top the charts any time soon, but Nks is really quite good. Great food, decent prices, and not-too-shabby service. Oh, and the place is huuuuge so lines aren't that big of an issue. That's already better than a ton of dim sum places out there. And if it keeps grandma happy, well, that's a solid win in my books.

{"text":"Pros:
-this place is huge, so you'll rarely have to wait for a table
-cheap $$

Cons:
-some of the dishes were poorly made; pretty sure the chicken feet we got was reheated
-presentation and quality of the food isn't as nice as other places.

I would come to Nks if you want to save some $$ and don't want to want to wait for a table elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been here lots of times for that traditional Sunday family brunch. Quality is a solid 3* in the sense that it doesn't really stand out but it isn't the worst thing I've ever eaten either.

It's a huge restaurant and the service is alright. Honestly, it's about as average Ã  place as you can think of.

I did really like their scallop and vermicelli with grated garlic dish. It's huge and it's $6.99, only available on weekends. Definitely get it if you are feeling rich. It's a nice experience and it's actually pretty tasty. I think this is what makes it different from other places.

I also really like their congee. Flavour is great but the actual congee is a little too watery, meaning they didn't cook it enough.

Finally, I don't know if it's because it's so big but their ac is weak. I was literally sweating and fanning myself the entire meal. I looked like I was having hotpot but I was just having cooled down dimsum. Ridiculous. 

Their yin yang rice... I wouldn't recommend it. The shrimp has some veins and the taste isn't totally spectacular but the red sourish sauce was not bad."}
{"text":"I had a really really low expectation for this place and I honestly wasnt looking forward to coming here. However i was pleasantly suprised. Food wasnt as bad as I thought. It was quite fresh and the taste was legit too. The shrimp dumpling was fresh. The chicken feet was flavourful. The pan fried pork bun was also fried to perfection. Early bird is $2.98 mon-friday before 11 am. They also come out with a variety of dim sum too in their little carts. We got their fried red bean bun which was also delicious for $2.98. Service was friendly and food was fresh."}
{"text":"I come here almost every Saturday for family dim sum. I enjoy the environment a lot and really appreciate the spacious restaurant as well as the cleanliness of their washrooms. The food is pretty good for their price and does taste cleaner than surrounding joints. 
The smartest thing about their business is even though most food is pushed around in carts, you can order the \"ha gow\" & \"siu mai\" off a paper menu. That way you won't have to wait forever for the cart to get to you!
This place gets fairly busy after 11am, so be sure to come early!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service is meh. You tell them the type of tea you want and they give you something else. You ask again for what you want and they forget to bring it to you. Good sized restaurant for a wedding banquet but be warned that weekend parking is horrendous. Your wedding guests will be 'thrilled' and I emphasize that in a sarcastic manner."}
{"text":"??kennedy?hwy7???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok,?????????????????????????????????d???????"}
{"text":"Dimsum is awful. Food in the bamboo steamers are lukewarm at best and the quality of their food just ins't there. Very fatty meats used and you have to ask multiple times for the same thing (e.g. mustard, tea refills, etc.) They have tons of tables and the space is massive, but it's a shame that their kitchen can't produce food of decent quality and their management is still as awful as before. Their selection of dimsum also isn't that large and their prices aren't competitive, so they really don't have any standout aspects about them for dimsum.

We came for Friday night dinner and we were very surprised that they had cornered off more than 60% of the restaurant and only around a dozen tables were being used for that night's service. It's very shocking to see that on a Friday night. We were given a dinner menu and a page with 2 set specials for that evening. The set specials were too much food for our party of 3 and frankly, food we didn't like. For example, there was a water duck stew, but water duck is very chewy and traditionally only meant for soups, not as a stew. However, the a la carte dinner menu was extremely overpriced with prices on par with high end dinner establishments - which they are not. As an estimate, ordering off the a la carte dinner would have likely been around $120 + tax + tip. We paid $100 for the special we ended up ordering, which was definitely more food than we needed. The service was lackluster and they seemed very rushed even though the place was not full and they weren't closing soon. We also did not get change after we paid in cash, which was fairly rude, considering we really weren't going to pay that much in tips. As is with most restaurants in the area, if you pay with cash, they cover the tax, so you end up only paying the listed price + tips.

Anyhow, won't return unless absolutely necessary. Poor dimsum and dinner in terms of quality of food, service and price."}
{"text":"This place has changed over so many times. It was pretty empty when we arrived. In-laws asked for a certain tea but they brought the wrong one. When they asked for the right one they wanted, they took forever to bring it over.
 
But besides that, the dim sum itself wasn't bad at all. The ha gow were super big and was very well made, skin stayed in tack when picked up and texture of the skin was just the right thickness. 

We ordered 8 dishes for 4 ppl. The price was still a bit pricer, total was $37...."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for dim sum before the change in name/ownership and I've always been satisfied with the food and service. I didn't expect anything different on this visit. We kinda got carried away with the ordering and dishes started showing up fast and plentiful. Maybe it was a bit too fast. We started getting duplicate dishes and we lost track of what we had already consumed. In the end, our party of nine had ordered 34 dishes (I told you we got carried away!) and they brought 37. Hmmm, whatever. We took home leftovers.

Although the food was good and the service was fast, it was confusing. None of our servers spoke English and none of us spoke Chinese. If you come here for a meal, bring a friend or relative  who speaks Cantonese."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Hmm...seemed like that experience I had the first time was a one-off experience. 

I've been back here a couple of times since, and I will admit, for the price you pay the food quality is actually very good. It's not Dragon Boat or Spring Villa quality, but for $2.98 fixed price dim sum on weekends the quality is way more than what I can ask for. In fact, I find the beef tripe here to be better than many other dim sum places I've dined at before.

Service was also a lot better this time around. It was actually easy to wave someone down, and by no means will they chase you out once you finish eating.

Hopefully this place stays afloat; it gets quite busy during weekend lunch!"}
{"text":"Service - Pretty awful. Had to get up and serve myself. Found a hair that's clear as daylight and the man in the black suit didn't even apologize. 

Food - Decent, cheap. Understandable why it's so busy."}
{"text":"We like the previous owners WAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. It obviously isnt as busy as before. Yet we still come for dinner for the peking duck. Communication is difficult but we manage, however they are so rude when we try to explain what we want. We come here occasionally for dim sum and the pace of the food is consistent. Sometimes it is rather slower and things needed to be reminded. 

We were here for Thanksgiving dinner and ordered two ducks and some other things. Its interesting how when we asked for the items to be packed up they handed us some styrofoam boxes and left it there (with no bag). If they're going to name themselves a \"banquet hall\" shouldnt the expectations be of that? Not just because they can book off sections of the room? The service should be just as expected. Maybe I'm high maintenance who knows but meh. 

The food is just average. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"[Good]
Price - Dim sum prices are decent.  Topped out at $4.99 for the special dishes like short ribs.

Menu - I actually don't mind the dim sum menu being a little leaner.  Most places have so many rows to sift through.  I guess I was feeling lazy.

Restaurant size - This replaced New Mong Kok and it's just as big.  The bigger the less wait for a table.

[Neutral]
Food - Pretty standard fare and flavour.  Nothing really stood out too much.  If you like mango pudding, it's huge.  Also they serve durian tarts for those who are into it.  Flavour wasn't bad for the tarts.

[Worth it?]
Yes, it's not bad.  Pretty middle of the pack on everything and hence the 3 stars for A-OK."}
{"text":"Other than the food being really good, the people were just way to cold. I walk in and the servers just look at me very coldly. Afterwards, when we wanted to ask for the vinegar, she gave us the \"not impressed look\"

  Despite the servers being cold, the food was really good. I told my mum that I wasn't hungry and I didn't want to eat a lot, but I couldn't help it! My favorite dishes were the cow tendons, the steamed bun with salted egg yolk custard, and steamed chicken feet with abalone sauce...Soo good."}
{"text":"Dimsum is pretty decent here nothing too special but I did spot dr. Ho so if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for me :)

Wide selection of dimsum to choose from, big space and no waiting times."}
