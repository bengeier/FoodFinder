{"text":"Great restaurant in a location where good food is hard to find.  So far I've had the Penang Curry Tofu and the Pad Thai. Both were very good. I especially like that they have brown rice at no extra cost and small and large portions.  Another plus is that the place looks spotlessly clean!  Their to go menu indicates that they have four other locations.  I plan to have many meals here."}
{"text":"Really good quality food for the price.   I really like the Tai Delight.  Also good lo mein."}
{"text":"Asian cuisine is my choice for neighborhood take out Chinese with beef with broccoli being my go to order. The portion sizes are pretty big and can last me 2 meals. It's a cheap, fast, and good tasting Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Great little Chinese restaurant near us in Monroeville.  We've dined in, as well as ordered for take-out.   For dining in, it's a good venue for a quick bite.  You won't be dining for the ambiance, just for a good, quick bite to eat.  For take-out, it's quick.

The quality is good, always freshly made.  Service is friendly from a family run operation.  Price is great.  The two of us get two meals plus egg rolls for less than $25."}
{"text":"This is always my go to Chinese restaurant (granted I work in the plaza) everyone who works here is awesome and friendly and gets my order correct. Service is really fast! I've never eaten in so I can't really say how that is but the take out is great! Online ordering is nice, but so is calling in it just stopping in while you're doing your shopping! Specials all day! Favorite dishes are the panang curry with tofu and the honey shrimp!"}
