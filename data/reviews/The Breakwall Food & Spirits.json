{"text":"Love this place.  Great atmosphere and the prices are right.  I have yet to have a bad meal at this joint.  The service is very, very good and they have a nice patio so you can enjoy the nice weather.  The pizza has a little extra zing to it which is delicious.  It's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"My daughter and son in law has done an excellent job with this place. All their home made food is priced well for the family. Their remodeling is beautiful. YOU will always feel welcome and have a clean place to eat drink, DJ an Karoke lots fun."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times and service is hit or miss, however the last visit was terrible.  My family sat down and we waited 15 - 20 minutes for a server even though they passed our table several times.   It was not busy.  After our drink order they brought some drinks after a considerable wait but did not bring my wife her drink.  When we ordered the food they said the do not put chicken on pizzas even though it is on the menu.   The sever was very rude and when we asked for help part way through our meal the sever said they were done with their shift and we would have to wait.  Ok food but very poor and rude staff.   Our visit last month was definitely our last!"}
{"text":"I love the breakwall! Great food, great prices, great service! The pizza crust is delicious, Arizona ranch wing sauce is amazing, plus they have a patio! Come for lunch, good specials!"}
{"text":"The Breakwall is an excellent place. They treat us like family. The food is awesome and all the food specials are big portions. The clientele is very friendly and middle aged. Kid friendly. We love this place and visit often. It's a must try establishment."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood bar and eatery.  The food is very good and the drink prices are very reasonable.  They have a very nice patio and the service is excellent.  They usually have some sort of entertainment going on in the evenings as well.  There is plenty of bar seating, tables, games and a jukebox.  It's not a bad spot to watch a game either and they are happy to turn on the volume as requested which a lot of places won't do."}
{"text":"Friendly and cozy little bar. People of all ages seem to hang out there. Compared to many Avon Lake bars this one has a cheerful and fun vibe. I have only had the wings and they were outstanding. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Boy Oh Boy... What an interesting experience!  My boyfriend lives on the far west side and I am always looking for new places to check out within a reasonable distance from him. I have driven by this place a few times and read decent reviews and decided to suggest this place for a late Friday dinner.   I knew from the area that this was going to be neighborhood bar and apparently on Fridays they have karaoke! This was the first thing that made it quite a night but also the fact that the 3 people near us was very drunk (at 9pm)!  Those said people kept staring at us,and I felt I really had no where to look as we were sitting at an L shaped bar. Can we say awkward!  The bartenders were busy, so busy that we waited almost 10 minutes before we were even recognized-probably because we are not regulars. Once we did get service we were surprised by the food. It was actually pretty good. I got a french dip and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The fries were like fair fries (in a good way). Unfortunately, after we got our food we were forgotten about again. It's easy to say we won't be back and that it was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"Just picked this bar out of the blue to meet with another couple.  We were not disappointed.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Service was great, the food good (French fries just ok, but tater tots rock) Will make this my new handout."}
{"text":"We adore coming here! My husband and I have had date nights as well as family time for rock and rill bingo Wednesdays!! I also bring my book club in every other Friday. I choose this location for the amazing food, fantastic service and fun vibe if the restaurant.  As i stated previously the menu has a great selection with very affordable  prices. And the portions are HUGE!!  The staff is always friendly and attentive as well as the owners always visible.   My favorites... Bloody Mary (they craft their own mix) and the French dip!!   Looking to try something new.... Look no further!!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for a bite to eat and grab a drink. The original burger with cheese was incredible along with the fresh fries. The inside is a lot larger than you would image from the outside street view.   Waitress was friendly and very attentive to our service and keep the drinks coming, both pop and spirits...  We will definitely be back to watch a game in the near future."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Amazing food and service. Super friendly crowd and the Sunday breakfast is truly the best! Prices are great and the beer is cold! They also offer cans of beer in addition to bottles! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Went for breakfast and what a deal!! The omelets we ordered were HUGE and delicious. First time we were able to get a pepperoni stuffed omelet!! Delicious!! Breakfast also came with hash brown potatoes, sausage or bacon and toast!! The service was great and was able to have a carafe of coffee at our table so we didn't have for ask for coffee!!Will definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"The regulars are rude. The service was OK. The patrons were weird, they don't work there, but were rude to me and my friends who do not go there often. The servers seem to favor the regulars as well, felt like it was a private bar."}
{"text":"Move over Disney,  This maybe the HAPPIEST place on the planet.  And the food is all made with love. The folks that make all the magic happen are some of the kindest people you will ever come across.   In all aspects my short time there this was just a pleasure.  If i lived in Avon OH, this would be my place Of choice.  Very similar to the famous bar Cheers!!!  I will return. Thank you Steve"}
{"text":"Great value time and time again.  Had the sliders again. Always good. Love the chicken hunks and fried pickles too. Cuban good. Nice folks earning a good reputation for above average bar food.  Oh, and chicken noodle soup was delicious.   We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great food and local . Love the vibe and low key feel. Living close we go often for a quick bite and a nice cold one . Always treated great"}
{"text":"I come here all the time but recently they have cut back on staffing and it seems that all of the good people are gone now. We were in with a great group and suddenly the service dried up. Everyone at our table needed drinks and to place our food order and the server wasn't around for a half hour"}
{"text":"This is a fine place. Prices have crept up since they opened but still good value, especially the specials. Crowd is mixed, mostly middle aged locals. If you're looking to have a few drinks and some bar food at fair prices, Breakwall is a good option in this area."}
{"text":"After my review the manager contacted me. She never got any of my messages. She resolved my issue. Very nice lady!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Better than average burger with generous toppings. Tomatoes almost sliced too thickly, red onion, good pickles, toasted brioche bun, and fresh cut fries. The place comes off as a divey biker bar, but the food and decor are taken up a notch. Really good iced tea. Very pleased."}
{"text":"It's hard to beat... Great food, nice place, and the bar tenders are what makes it a great experience."}
{"text":"I couldn't finish the shipwreck. 1 lb of meat is a lot. I got about 90% of it down. Delicious as usual."}
{"text":"Inconsistent unfortunately.   My wife and I have been regulars here (3 times a week usually) until this morning at Sunday brunch.  I have never been so insulted as I was today at a restaurant. My food came out slow and was cold and when I mentioned it to my waitress she told me to \"mind my surroundings.\"   She had 8 tables and was the only server there.  I really like food here and like supporting a local business but can't see myself going back.  It's too bad, I really wish they weren't even open for brunch so I could continue to support them and enjoy the restaurant. Hopefully if the owner reads this she cares enough to eliminate the problem."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this restaurant based on food- mainly takeout.   Breakwall is a solid choice- especially when rocking the daily specials. Thursday is burger night and it's a delicious burger- and even more affordable than usual. The burgers are a nice size, usually cooked to perfection (docked a little for a few times being a little less than medium well). Tonight I paid a small upcharge for tater tots instead of fries with the burgers. Fries can be a bit soggy when getting takeout.   I also really enjoy the pizza special on Saturday- it's more of a homemade style pizza but super yummy IMO. Crust has herbs in it and sauce has a slight heat (very subtle but makes it interesting). Saturday night pizza is $5.50 and it's a nice size. Small upcharge for toppings. I usually ask for it to be overcooked and it comes out perfect. Great tip of you have some people over- I ordered 4 pizzas a few Saturday's ago and they were a hit and though it took a little longer- can't beat the price!   I've tried many things on the menu- nothing I wouldn't get again. Really enjoyed the chicken breast sandwich (plain with just a nice grilled breast that is seasoned slightly and well cooked) and the pulled pork with cole slaw.   This is a local, family run place and the food  is solid, affordable and can't beat the daily specials here.  Oh yeah, my husband says don't forget the wings!! Yeah, they are awesome. I love the BBQ- pretty sure the BBQ sauce is homemade. Yum.   Takeout time can be a little slow and since it's a bar the customer service for food orders is a little off putting-- but we still think it's worth it, especially since it's right on our way home."}
{"text":"A group of us went to The Breakwall for our lunch hour and ordered: large Caesar salad (no meat), black and blue burger, and a personal pepperoni pizza.  The salad was $9, the burger was $9, and the pizza was $5.50 (on special).  It's strange that a meatless salad and a huge burger cost the same?????  The salad was not worth $9 for the following reasons: the croutons were burnt making everything else taste burnt, there wasn't any meat, and there wasn't anything overwhelmingly awesome about it.  $9 for a meatless salad is just too much to charge.  My friend ordered her burger as medium rare, and it was more than well done.  The fries that came with her meal tasted like they were leftover from the day before and had no seasoning.  My other coworker who ordered the pizza said The pizza dough wasn't cooked all the way and had too much seasoning in the dough itself.  The dough looked brown instead of golden.  The pizza was super greasy looking at it and didn't taste very good.  The staff was super friendly and the decor inside was nice as well.  Probably a better place to drink than to eat.  I don't recommend their food based on all three of us having a poor experience, but I would be willing to try their bar.  Kind of a letdown."}
