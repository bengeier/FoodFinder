{"text":"Love this place.  Affordable and delicious.  It would get a 5 star if it was a bit nicer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesecake!!!  I got the vegitarian lasagna with a side of mac and cheese and potatoes. Very deleicious. Huge portions. New favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Greek food.  The owner is a very nice guy.  I tried the chicken and pork souvlaki dinners with rice and potatoes.   They offer garlic bread over pita if that not your thing.  

Will be back"}
{"text":"We've been here several times. If we still lived in Scarborough, we'd come here even more often. Their portions are HUGE. From the souvlaki to the philly, the average person won't be able to finish in one sitting. Speaking of the souvlaki and the philly, both taste great. The fish sandwich isn't overflowing with flavour, but I'd have no objections to getting another sometime. The weakest item I've had would probably be the breaded chicken. Very soft, not crispy. Just personal preference. The strongest point, however, is the Louis Burger. It's not always perfect (2/7 times it's tasted like grease or questionably prepared), but when it's good, it's, in my opinion, the best burger I've had in all of Scarborough."}
{"text":"Showed up for takeout dinner on a Tuesday Evening, got the ribs and chicken combo. Mac and cheese was kind of bland, potatoes and chicken were good, but the ribs. Oh man. Raw in the middle, still bloody. Absolutely disgusting! Be careful!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best place to eat. If you want authentic Greek food at an amazing price come here. As a Greek I can tell you this is the best Greek food I've had in the city and the service is friendly and accommodating with the menus. Awesome job guys!! Love your place!!"}
{"text":"Really nice to find a Greek place in the area. Nice clean premise, with good naturally lit seating. Prices are reasonable, considering what you get. 

Chicken Gyro  
-Went for the chicken gryo. Good portion size, came with coleslaw ( I think ), and a beverage. Nicely packaged, when I first got it assumed it was the wrong order. 

Good not too dry or stale pita, good amount of veggies, sauce, and good portion of well seasoned chicken. During the end had to use a fork to finish all the extra chicken. 

My only gripe was that the chicken seemed a bit dry and the entire gyro was oily ... Not sure if it was a mistake or if that's their method of preparing it but wasn't my thing. When I took it out of the container noticed a good amount of oil residue. 

Based on the chicken gyro I received, would give it 3.5/5 stars. It was good, but the excessive oil and dry chicken wasn't."}
{"text":"Best gyro outside of the Danforth! I no longer have to make the trek there for proper greek food. Fries were delicious and the souvlaki was solid too."}
{"text":"Great food great neighbourhood love this place in east Scarborough ..the chicken and pork gyros are amazing so is the souvlaki and tzatiki yummmm!!!"}
