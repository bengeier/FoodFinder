{"text":"The epitome of \"country kitchen\". The sweet staff and obviously fresh home cooked meals warmed me from the inside out. I felt like I was back at grandma's. The items on the menu and decor are very...how do I say this...Anglo Saxon? So if you're in the mood for something very traditional, they've got it. If you're in the mood for something exciting, keep walking. I'll probably never go back again, but that's not because it left me unsatisfied, but because I can't imagine ever being back in Schomberg again."}
{"text":"This looked like a cute homey place so we stopped in for brunch during a day trip but it honestly had the most DISGUSTING food. I ordered a quiche which was bland and tasteless, even a little watery. The quiche came with a side salad that had dirt on the leaves. My boyfriend ordered pasta which might as well have been a microwaved Michelina's meal. It came out extremely cold in the centre and so he let the server know. She took it to the back and I swear to god I heard a microwave turning on and then beeping, lending even more credence to our Michelina's theory. After trying the food, we cancelled our dessert order and left ASAP. Everything we had tasted like cheap frozen dinners with jacked up prices."}

{"text":"I've been coming to Sheena's since I was a little kid. If you are looking to visit Shomberg with small children, I remember my visits with a pleasant nostalgia, theres a small park along on the main street and connections to trails nearby activity wise. Coming from the city you wont be blown away by Sheena's service or their latest update to the dining room which consists of plastic table cloths. The food is all like something my English grandmother would make; quiche, shepherds pie, scones and sugar cookies, its good north-western european comfort food. The store adjacent to the tea room is always full of fun reclaimed antiques and trinkets  which are really grounding with a cow printed pillow priced at $20.00 which would be sold at Urban Outfitters to serve some gen-x longing for irnoy at $50.00. If you ever find yourself stranded in Shomberg during Sheena's hours of operation, stop in for a spot of tea."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely not something you see everyday. It's a mishmash of eastern spices along with some, I suppose, what you could call \"Canadian Cuisine\" although I'm not sure what exactly that would be.  Overall the food has a very home made to it and it's certainly not bad, and on the healthier side of things (low sodium etc.) I suspect to fit the main elderly clientele of this place.  That said, I had a chicken wrap which was just terrible! The pita was stale and broke apart as soon as I tried to take a bite. The chicken was drenched in mayo and straight out of the fridge, still hovering at around 4-5 degrees centigrade probably. Yes, they use cute napkins, cutlery and plates but those are no excuse for sub-par food. The rest of our group tried some other fare (after the special on the board turned out to not be available!) which were OK. Portions, at least for lunch, are tiny as well so don't go here on an empty stomach expecting to get full at a reasonable price.  Overall this place is a bit quirky and I guess it has it's own local clientele judging most of the 5-6 tables were occupied. It might even have a certain cuteness factor to it but it's one of those places Robert Irvine won't stop shaking his head looking at all the stuff hanging and dwindling all over the place.  One thing to note: We didn't try their pastries and I believe that was a big mistake. We probably would have had a far better experience with their pastries as they looked quite tasty on the other patron's plates.  Alas, for our experience I can unfortunately only give a Meh 2* rating considering the high price and the poor quality of my wrap specifically."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try this place by a friend who is a returning customer, who had great things to say about the food. Decided to try it out in the summer of 2015 with the same friend and we were really excited to go.  It is a cute, cottage-style restaurant on Main Street, which is around the corner from where I live. When we arrived, it was around lunch and extremely crowded, almost overwhelmingly in such a small place. We were offered to find ourselves a seat (???) so we took to the patio to feel less congested (also because there were no seats with enough sitting space inside). Out there, there was a table but only one chair, which we had to wait for.  When we finally both sat down, we ordered 2 fresh lemonades which were SO fresh and delicious. The menu is very underwhelming, however I've heard that they have recently improved it. I ordered a BLT and my friend ordered half a BLT with a side soup. I would rate my BLT as the #1 that I've ever had! Trying to locate the waitress was difficult as it was so busy and there was only one working. Definitely recommend the brownie, which is HUGE for a great price! Overall, great food, lacking service."}
