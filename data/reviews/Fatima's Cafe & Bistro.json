{"text":"A great little place in the Junction.  

Try the Penne with Spicy Italian Sausages & Rapini in Tomato Sauce.  It is amazing and the price is reasonable for the portion size you get!!"}
{"text":"I visited this new restaurant in the Junction area of Toronto a few days ago with chef, author and food critic who now resides in Toronto.  The meal started with a baguette accompanied  by olive oil and balsamic vinegar The entrees included penne pasta in a tomato basil sauce and a burger accompanied with fries.  Both meals were good.  In fact, the burger was excellent, perfectly prepared and served on french bread instead of a stale bun.   

In terms of price, this bistro is a good value.  Both meals were less then $10 each.  This is definitely a welcome edition to the overpriced food typically associated with Bloor West as well as The Junction area.

We will both be returning.  I have heard great reviews about fatima's weekend brunch and plan on trying it.
