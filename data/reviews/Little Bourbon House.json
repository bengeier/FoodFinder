{"text":"Very small place is a bit of a hole in the wall with only 4 tables plus the bar for seating and one guy doing the cooking and serving on Sunday afternoon, but the food is pretty good. I got the shrimp po boy sandwich which was really tasty with a spicy mayo. The bun was a bit too big, making the ratio of bread to insides a bit off. You get fries with it so you don't really need anything else since it is a lot of food, but I also ordered the hushpuppies and AA side of cheese grits just to see what why were like since they are almost impossible to get up here. The hushpuppies were delicious and came with a hot dipping sauce.  The cheese grits were ok but definitely not made by someone who really knows how to make grits. The taste was ok with lots of cheese and jalapeno but were over cooked and a bit mushy.

It is way out of the way for us, but I would go there again if in the area.  Next time I would like to try the gumbo."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. Great food. Great ambiance. Great service.  Do yourself a favor and go here. Order anything. Seriously, anything and find yourself satisfied and at a very reasonable price. 

I cannot say enough about how great all the food is, quality and quantity. Usually I would describe food, but all I can say is it's a special delicious comforting joint that is perfect for a chill date, a hangover, getting a hangover, cheat meal or a family dinner. TRY IT. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have rarely had food of this quality before. And we LOVE finding fault with food. This is a little Toronto gem!!! Our server was stellar - happy, full of suggestions and a genuine compliment to the quality of the food. If you love Cajun/creole cooking you will LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"We found this little gem of a place while driving by past it on our way home. Thank you Yelp reviewers for the help. We love the food !(takeout or sit down). The staff were so friendly and helpful. They were quick to greet us and ask if we want some water while we're deciding our options. If your looking for a four star dinning room experience and ambience look no further. What I really mean is that all you need is great comfort food, friendly staff, and a place to enjoy it. Well, enjoy!!
We first tried the corn bread with butter followed by the Creole Mac and Cheese ( 6 cheeses, sweet potatoes and red peppers). We had to order the Hush Puppies ( with Lime Garlic Piquante hot sauce).  I had to have the Voodoo Shrimps and Grits ( with Andouille bites and creamy spiced sauce).  The staff went out of their way to make sure I was able to have my grits .My better half had the Smoked Beef Brisket Po'boy Sandwich (served with fries). We ate most of our meal but left some for my lunch tomorrow . Yummy"}
