{"text":"Great family owned business. We love paradise valley burger company and have been looking forward to trying the pizza restaurant.  We were not disappointed. Great job!   We will be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our takeout of one each of the small Jorge and Brulee pizzas, and a side of the Brussel sprouts.  We found the flavor combinations very creative and complimentary.  Now, there can be great debate about the nuances of this, that and the other thing, but in all, I'm ecstatic to have them in the 'hood and wish them great success!"}
{"text":"First time in, the guys were super friendly and made some good suggestions. I went with the Pizza Brulee and was not disappointed!! Personal size was enough for lunch with leftovers for later. LOVED the crust and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place has been open for one week and I've already been there twice. I got the Jorge pizza both times and my wife tried the paradise pesto, we both think the pizza is fantastic. The wings are insanely delicious. I would highly recommend the Jorge pizza with the brown sugar buffalo wings. If you're looking for delicious pizza and wings this is definitely the place. Great food. Great people."}
{"text":"This is the BEST PIZZA ever!!!!!!!!!!!! I like the variety of toppings and the connoli are out of this world.  Try the calzone special - its to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, easy and delicious!!  Pepperoni Pizza was as it should be with spicy authentic pepperoni.  Perfect amount of crust.  The Phoenix was equally good with just the right amount of BBQ.  Not a fan of the cannoli, but that doesn't detract from the main course."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff. Even the teenage mutant ninja turtles eat here when they com visit the desert. I like the pepperoni,  some of our party did the Ditka, we even had a hamburger and cheese. Loved the butterygarlicycrunchi crust!!! Can't wait to return and try the CeasarSalad. Thanks for not making any ordinary pizza."}
{"text":"Love the burgers. Love the pizza. Love having the Paradise Valley Co restaurants in our neighborhood!! Great job guys, keep it up!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I heard about Paradise Valley Pizza Company from a trusted relative and made a 30 mile drive from Gilbert to see if it was really that good.  Wow, I wish they would open a place in Gilbert!  We started with the brussel and artichoke salad and it is simply the best salad with roasted brussel sprouts ever made.  Our brown sugar buffalo wings were served at the same time as the Ditka pizza and I went for a wing first.  Just right amount of zing with sweet, crispy outside and tender inside with a flavor to savor.  I thought the place should be named the PV Wing Company, but ... the pizza was incredible!  The crust was done to perfection with just the right amount of marinara, cheese, house made sausage, and crispy onion to yield superior flavor and texture.  This is a very casual place with paper plates, plastic utensils, and friendly staff.  You want to plan on eating slow to thoroughly enjoy the flavors and textures of the food.  The pizzas are made from scratch and the prices are very reasonable.  Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of their sister restaurant, Paradise Valley Burger Company so naturally we had to get our hands on the pizza. I didn't think they could improve upon pizza (because I love all pizza- one of my favorite foods) but they knocked it out of the park! My husband got the Ditka, I got the Phoenix, and my kids got a simple cheese with mushrooms and sausage. My daughter, who is picky, ate three slices of pizza and asked for more. The crust is a little crunchy on the bottom while still being chewy around the edges and it is perfection. We also ordered the maple bacon wings which were good. My husband raved about them, but I would like to try more flavors. We left with four cannoli and full stomachs. Please try this place out if you're on the fence. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot just ask Brett, Thomas, Mitchel and the rest of the staff!  We love to support our local proprietors so when we found PVPC and their burger place next store we knew we found a neighborhood gem!  Their pizza is awesome but you must also try their slow-roasted  wings and homemade sauces too. Everything about this place rocks..and that goes for the staff too....they are 100% customer focused.  Oh and if you want a burger and fries with your pizza they will bring it over from their sister restaurant next door. To top it off...PVPC is a byob!   We couldn't decided on the toppings so they split the pie into quarters!"}
{"text":"Brought to you by the same folks who own Paradise Valley Burger Company. And just as thoughtful and good. On the menu? Personal sized pizzas, wings, a few salads, and cannolis (imagine a Lucky Charms cannoli). I had the Paradise Pesto which is a white (no sauce) pizza with ricotta, garlic, basil pesto, artichoke, lemon, parmesan, & pignolis (pine nuts). Excellent combination. The lemon brightens without overpowering and artichokes are great with a little char. I'll order out again when I want a white pizza. I also got a garden salad. Except for the pickled onions the salad was kind of unremarkable. The slices of beefsteak tomatoes would be better replaced with a tastier version of tomato and maybe some sliced black or green olives. What was wonderful was the bleu cheese dressing; creamy, rich, with a little (surprise!) heat. Definitely a treat. Hopefully they'll expand their pizza sizes & maybe consider doing calzones (that would be great). Regardless, I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed some delicious pizza here. The Cesaer salad was very yummy too. It's just a place to get quick pizza to eat in or take out order. No real atmosphere.  But its just what we were looking for that day. They have a creative pizza menu I would try some different ones next time. Only suggestion maybe pizza could be a bit less greasy.  Definitely recommend good food here."}
{"text":"I can honestly say, this is the best personal size pizza I've ever had! I picked up the Paradise Pepperoni added shrooms to it, and it was straight flame emojis. I've been a fan of their Burger joint down the sidewalk for years, but this was my first time trying the pizza spot, needless to say, I'll be back! Keep killin the game fellas!"}
{"text":"I went back for round 2 and I'm happy I did.  I really enjoyed my second pizza from here. This time around I had the Paradise cheese pizza with fresh garlic and it was perfect. The pizza purists will feel me on this one. You don't need a ton of toppings all the time to be good :) I now have a go to spot for fresh ingredient local pizza! Thank you Bret and thank you Paradise Pizza Co."}
{"text":"Saw the triple D episode where they came and visited Paradise Valley Burger and Paradise Valley Pizza Company, and thought to myself \"Well, I'm doing business in Scottsdale so let's make a pitstop and see if I can get some pizza?!\"  Stopped by for a late lunch about 2:30 and the friendliest guy is the only one working in the joint. I ordered up at Ditka personal pizza, and he hands me these homemade Doritos chips that are like crack! Think of if Frito Lay made something from scratch, and you get the drift.  Pizza comes out in like 10 minutes, and it's everything I hoped for. It's got pork it's got sausage it's got cheese, and it's really great! I can at half and take half back with me to the hotel for later... I leave happy-happy.  So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"Hmm. Less than impressed, even after all the positive reviews. Really wanted to like this place since I love PV Burger Company. But the taste just didn't translate from burger to pizza. And before ya'll get crazy and call me crazy for trying to compare Burger and pizza, allow me to explain.  It's ok to have a little grease to a Burger because beef needs some fat to enhance the flavor. When my pizza is greasy, something is up and it inevitably ends up being a sloppy pizza. The Margarita pizza had some ok flavors. Let me assure you, I love cilantro. If I could have cilantro cologne, I would. I'd put cilantro on sugarless Wheaties and enjoy it simply because of the cilantro. Because let's face it, no one likes sugarless Wheaties. But besides that, it just felt like I was eating a thick crust cheese crisp. The Jorge and The Goat pizza was incredibly greasy and salty. I get that there's pepperoni on it so it's going to have some of those qualities but I shouldn't be able to soak a napkin with grease when dabbing the top.   The only reasons I gave this 2 stars were the price and proximity to home. Otherwise, just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I love their burgers but this is just like any other personal sized pizza place like Mod. Would be 3 stars because it isn't bad by any means, just nothing special. But they're lucky I didn't knock it to one for the cannolis. Good lord might be the worst dessert I've ever put in my mouth, for almost 5 bucks."}
{"text":"This little pizza joint is absolutely fantastic. I ordered a Ditka pizza and can say I was impressed with the variety of specialty pizza's and with the flavor complexity. They also do wings and cannoli's in a wide array of flavors. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like pizza and this is the best pizza in Phoenix. I loved the Ditka. They have crazy cannoli, and maple bacon wings! Will be back next week!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago on vacation out west we dined at Paradise Valley Burger (the sister resturant in the same shopping center) after seeing it on the food network. Best Burger Ever, simply put. After hearing chef Bret Shapiro ventured into the pizza world with his second location - a stop at paradise valley pizza was a non negotiable on our next trip.   As a native New Yorker, I can confidently say I know my pizza! This may be a casual dining joint, but is honestly serving Michelin quality food. The Speciality Pies are the way to go, the menu was intriguing - original, extremely creative, yet classic - which means we had to try a little of everything. We had the 1967, The Phenoix, and traditional Pepperoni. They were all truly awesome, my favorite being the 1967 (they are known for their Pizza Brûlée too). We also had 2 orders of wings, the Chipotle Truffle and Maple Bacon which were accompanied by home made ranch and dipping sauces. After we demolished everyone we polished off the meal with two homemade cannolis, the lucky charms and Oreo.   Overall Paradise Valley Pizza was able to honor and elevate the tradition of pizza by mastering their cheese, sauce, and dough game and brought their \"speciality pie\" game to an extraordinary level. The ingredients are so fresh, paired perfectly, and the pies were executed flawlessly (crispy, proportional, with a timeless cheese blend and mouth watering sauce). Didn't miss a NY slice for a second!  I eat pizza 3x a week my whole life, I've earned the right to be a pizza critic in my own regard and this place is a GEM, just hoping they expand to the east coast.     Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Great personal pizzas. I just got the cheese and added some goat cheese and it reminded me of the pizza I had in Italy. Nice thin crust and very flavorful. Not the calorie bomb like most places! I also love that it is not a chain and the owner personally makes sure you are happy with the food."}
{"text":"My family was going to be in the neighborhood so we had to try out their pizza. We have already eaten at the burger joint and loved it so I was super excited to try out the pizza place. The kids wanted burgers and my wife and I wanted pizza. We asked the very helpful girl at the pizza place if we order there could we take the pizzas over to the burger place. She said of course. So we did and she said she would deliver the pizzas when they were ready. I try the daily special \"pollo asada pie\" and my wife had \"the Phoenix \". I love mine, it was spicy, cheesy, and so tasty. The chicken on mine had great depth of flavor and I really like the pomegranate seed on top. The Phoenix reminded me of a BBQ chicken pizza from CPK but this on have pulled pork on it and was much better. I wish we lived closer so I could try some of the other flavor combinations, but I would definitely eat there again!!"}
{"text":"You know that saying \"Get you a girl that can do both?\" Well Paradise Valley Burgers does Personal Pizzas now too. And they do it well.   Just a few doors down from their little burger shop, they opened up a pizza place. Just like the burger location they will also have a Pizza of the week. Today's was a St. Patrick's Day special. Irish Seasoned Beef, Creamy Whipped Potatoes, Baccon, Onions, Mozzarella, Tilamook Cheddar, and Horse Radish Crema. It was delicious. I was afraid that the creamy potatoes would make the pizza's wood fired crust soggy or be strange on a pizza in general. No... it was surprisingly perfect. All these toppings came together for the perfect St. Patrick's Day meal. Much better than Corned Beef and Cabbage. I'm very excited to come back and try their Pizza Brulee as the Brulee Burger is my favorite burger on planet earth! And it looks like their wings and unique sauces will be something fun and different to try as well.   Also, just like its sister store, its a simple building with no décor and no playing around service. You go in, order your food, give them your name, and either take it home or they will call your name and you can eat it there. Like they say on their website \"To make pizza great again! Gourmet pizza in a laid back environment!!!\""}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying me and my roommate fuck with PVBC and PVPC. Customer service is on point, I had the Phoenix and he had the brûlée pizza. We ordered the buffalo brown sugar wings like we were on a hot date. So much goodness wrapped into every, single, bite. And to top it off the muthafuckin lucky charms cannoli! Holy shit boys and girls (that's the only two genders that should eat at these places because the rest of you are fucking retarded) this shit was like the first time I orgasmed, it was gone way too quick and I wanted another."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Simply excellent. I moved to North Phoenix from Tempe, which is a Mecca for great restaurants, and I have been seriously missing the variety of options. We stumbled upon PV Burger Company after trying the other restaurants in the area, and fell in love with their burgers. Then we found out they were opening a pizza place, and it is some of the best pizza I've had in a while. We've tried the 1977, the Phoenix, the Special of the week with prociutto and dates, and a few others, plus the wings which are amazing! I absolutely recommend. Don't forget a side of jalapeño ranch!"}
{"text":"Really different types of pizzas. Ordered my own simple which I liked, ordered the Brulee for husband he liked it. Will order again soon."}
{"text":"I love PV Pizza!! I stop in at least once a week during my lunch break! Fast, friendly service from all who work here:) My favorite place to get a good slice"}
{"text":"We've loved PV Burger for a long time and PV Pizza Co is our newfound love! The pizza and wings were delicious."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Why? Here you go...  Greasy. Undercooked pizza dough. Skimpy on the ingredients. Greasy. VERY small pizza.  Go to My Pie on Tatum and get a much better, higher quality, handmade, bigger personal pizza actually cooked in a brick pizza oven for less."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I received a very nice note of apology from the owner and he took steps to address my issue. Based on that, I'm updating my review to 4 stars. The food IS really good - and the staff is really friendly (...they just have bad taste in music... )  ORIGINAL POST: \"While I really like the food here (as much as Paradise Valley Burger Co.) and the staff is friendly, I was shocked to hear a rap song playing in the place saying \"f*** my b****\" while I was standing at the counter waiting to pick up my food. I most certainly don't dislike rap music, but I think the \"kid friendly\" designation needs to be removed from Paradise Valley Pizza Co. if they insist on playing VERY kid-unfriendly music.\""}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley.   Everything about their pizza is great. The thin crust is beautifully thin. The cheese is flavor able and the toppings are a step above the rest. This is very authentic NY style.   I personally love getting their family size pizza. The slices are large and it reminds me most of NY pizza.   Service is always 5/5. Food is 5/5. Overall 5/5."}
{"text":"Paradise Valley Pizza is a small family owned business. The restaurant is very casual as you order at the counter and seat yourself. On the menu are mostly unique non-traditional individual pizzas, wings, salads and mostly non-traditional cannoli. (one was maple bacon)  We were greeted as we entered and everyone there was very helpful and pleasant.  I soon received my Margarita Pizza. The first thing I taste is an end of the crust. It's not like any other pizza crust I ever tried. It's light, flaky and shattering crisp, maybe buttery. The bottom is a thin crust that was crispy. My pizza is covered in a green sauce that is tangy and lightly sprinkled with serrano chili that is spicy. There is a light sprinkling of queso fresco, cubes of avocado and sprigs of fresh cilantro. My pizza is good but is hard to eat. The avocado cubes fall off the slices. I think if they were cut in slices they'd stay on better. The other minor issue is that the cilantro would be easier to eat if it was chopped because when you bite into a slice you accidentally chew up a whole sprig. If I got this Margarita again I would add corn to balance out the flavors and texture more.  I thought the pizza was a perfect individual size. Not too much and not too little.   My review is only based on one visit trying one pizza.  3.5 stars rounded up for cheerful pleasant staff.   Paradise Valley Pizza Co.  offers something different.  Worth a try when you are in the area."}
{"text":"If you want to try something different be sure to come here for some unique gourmet pizza.  The crust was really special and the taste combinations were a delight. We'll be  back, Looking forward to exploring other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Live around the corner from this place and finally got around to trying it. He pizza is awesome and the maple bacon wings were really good. We got three different pizzas and none disappointed. Also got the Oreo and lucky charms cannolis. The pizzas may sound a little odd but they're very creative and tasty. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had here in Phoenix!  We ordered the Belgian and the Phoenix.  Both were sooo good!  Service was excellent.  We'll be back for sure!   The only issue I had was that the restroom didn't have any soap.  Otherwise...it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in awhile had my favorite burger the Brûlée Burger on a pizza. It was out of this world I was craving another slice later that day."}
{"text":"As good as the burger place that spawned it (next door).  An eclectic collection of pizzas - some sound a bit too weird to be good, for example the pizza of the week inspired by biscuits and gravy, but who knows the one I had with crushed Doritos on top was alright and definitely loved the pizza brûlée.  Also tried maple bacon wings, which were really good despite tasting nothing like maple or bacon.  Only complaint was the cannolis are a bit runny - made my lucky charms soggy, which was a big fail."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place. Pizza was delicious. Bit pricey but worth it. Will definitely come again. Bravo PV Pizza!"}
{"text":"From the owner of Paradise Valley Burger, comes Paradise Valley Pizza. Ever been to the burger side? Bret is creative as hell, coming up with some of the craziest and bomb'est burgers I've ever had. Now, he's doing it with the pizza! I had something called the Phoenix... I can't describe it. This isn't your average pizza joint. This man / his team knows what's good and isn't afraid to experiment. You need to try it and not be scared to try it. BBQ pork on a pizza? Outrageous! But delicious! The only thing I have a problem with when I come to this side of town is whether we're having pizza or burgers... tough choice right there."}
{"text":"Tom is the man! Made a fantastic pizza and made sure we enjoyed it. Will be coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Very creative, unique, exceptional pizza just like their burgers at Paradise Valley Burger Company just 20 feet down the sidewalk!"}
{"text":"Went tonight around 7pm with my boyfriend, first time here. My boyfriend got a personal cheese pizza and I got the stuffed cheese pizza. Thomas was super quick, polite and friendly at the counter. Pizza was very good and the prices were nice! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The most creative personal pizza you'll ever have.    Everything I've tried is great, and I've tried almost everything, but my favorite so far I think is the \"Jorge and the stoned goat\". It has incredible flavor with the Fresno chilis, pepperoni, and goat cheese. It has Crushed Doritos on top and it's amazing. If you're thrown off, don't be! Chips and cheese dude! Kinda like Nachos? Yep.   Definitely try the maple bacon wings. They're a revelation.   I also can't not mention the Oreo canoli. If you're debating on which canoli to get - because you're obviously getting a canoli - get the Oreo. It's the best, and I've tried the maple bacon and traditional which are delicious as well."}
{"text":"AWESOME restaurant. We live literally right down the street. Been to PV Burger Co and they kill it, so we were thrilled to see this place go up. Came out tonight to try it and they have BYOB from 4-9pm. Good thing there's a liquor store right next door! These guys are doing good stuff."}
{"text":"Quality is what you get here. Don't let the price or the uniqueness detour you. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Crispy crunchy saucy cheesy tears of joy. Heavenly, gourmet, interesting. Friendly staff, cute shop, a stones throw away from Paradise Valley Burger -- my other favorite owned by the same people.   Try the Mediterranean with a side of their hot wing sauce."}
{"text":"Elliot : Move over Phoenix pizza joints... there is a new kid in town. PARADISE VALLEY PIZZA just opened and it's hand crafted pizza's are quite simply , perfection. The wings...amazing ! The salads are so good, you forget they're  good for you. Do yourself a favor and by- pass the others a go directly there, tell them Elliot sent you."}
{"text":"By far some of the best local Pizza in Phoenix!! Pizza was great! Everything was so unique. But one thing I was most impressed by was how passionate Tom was. If I didn't ask I would have thought he owned this place. ATTENTION OWNER: Tom is your man!! And if you leave this place without a cannoli your a fool!   We will be back, maybe tomorrow.   Side note, they have a BYOB license. Who woulda known that was a thing!"}
{"text":"Pizza ok, staff were super nice.  Was looking for a more artisanal pizza so this didn't really do it but."}
{"text":"The pizza here was ahhhhh-mazing!! Very delicious, fresh and awesome variety of pizzas! Service & staff was the best! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god!!!! I was in yesterday to try the pizza and was blown away! I have been thinking about this pizza all day! I got the special with chipotle ricotta, dates, arugula, and prosciutto. I am blown away with the quality of the crust cheese and all ingredients. Also the inside looks so cool and unique with pictures of their pizzas and cannolis with other retro props. Highly recommend this pizza! Best pizza I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful to live so close to this place. The employees are always extraordinary and kind. They go out of their way to be attentive and helpful. The food is amazing and they have various unique flavors on a weekly basis. One of my absolute favorite places as is paradise burger company!"}
{"text":"Small neighborhood place. Legit pizza. Little guy got the pepperoni and devoured it. The ditka if amazing. Wings were great too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, as their sister restaurant in the same plaza is my favorite hole in the wall burger spot. It has manhandled my hunger into submission on dozens of occasions. I ventured in on opening night and was greeted by a very happy to be working there employee and a guy who I later found out was the head chef and one of the two owners. She made recommendations which I appreciate and didn't hit me with the,\"everything's good\" Mumbo jumbo. I settled on my pizza, (the name fails me but it was ur a-typical play on words menu item.) Just a note of caution for families or hungry people they do not deliver and they don't have different sizes this is a one size fits all. Butttttt who knows it was opening night and I have to imagine they will eventually do both so don't not go just for that. I also got an order of six wings. Took everything to go. Tab ended up over 19 bucks. With tip 22 bucks. 10 for the pizza which for that price at a spot such as this I was expecting much bigger. 8 for the wings again for a small order I expected angels to fly out of the box and hand feed me those bad boys. I ordered the second hottest wings and they had zero spice.They were good don't get me wrong but not the heat I was hoping for. The pizza I will give it to them was GREAT. Wouldn't have changed a thing about the ingredients just maybe would have made it bigger as like with all good things I wanted more. The food was good and I would love to see them make it as they are a chill spot."}
{"text":"This place had surprisingly slipped under my radar for the past few months.  While my girlfriend and I have visited Paradise Valley Burger Co. on a few occasions, I'm sure I've spotted it and just assumed it was another local pizzeria going for the whole New York-influenced vibe. But after swinging by Tropical Sno recently, I noticed a striking similarity between the pizza and burger signs. I quickly put the pieces together and realized that the owner of Paradise Valley Burger is now serving up pizzas. Although further research revealed that this was actually his original intention and the burgers just simply came first.  Before going in, I kind of already knew what to expect. This isn't a place that's trying to be \"authentic\" or selling itself as Neapolitan. And as my girlfriend quickly pointed out, I typically turn my nose up at pizza places that gimmick themselves up too hard. But I guess I give this place a free pass, because they're not really trying to be anything more than what they are. A pizza place that emphasizes creativity over tradition.  Much like the burgers a few door down, some of the creations here are a bit strange. I'd imagine it might take some trial and error in order to find something that works for you. If you're a fan of the excellent burger brulee next door, you'll undoubtedly enjoy it in its pizza form. Only I'm pretty sure they forgot the burnt sugar on the one we tried for unknown reasons.  The margarita here is not the classic pizza that you're familiar with - but an actual take on the margarita drink. This pizza included a green sauce with serrano chili, avocado, lime, cilantro, and queso fresco. There's a bit of spice here, but not too harsh. I really enjoyed it. Additionally, we've also tried the elote, which seemed to be loaded up on everything except the actual corn, which was very minimal. Weird.  The crust, which I'm insanely picky about, was actually done quite well. They use a traditional pizza oven and the crust has a nice flaky texture with flavor depth and a light crunch. The style is similar to what you'd find at a place like La Grande Orange (sans the sourdough). I was actually quite impressed!  Honestly, I doubt this place is for everyone - although they do offer more traditional styled pizzas for those who want something basic. But as a whole, their pizza is more of an unconventional style that's all their own. So for that, I do give them some credit.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Yay! They are open!! I was psyched for this place to open. We have been huge fans of PV Burger since they opened. Delicious, creative food with warm service. We have been anticipating this opening for a couple months. Well, okay. I have been stalking them a little. On FB and in person...  They took over Isa's Pizza's spot. Cozy little place by PV Burger Company. (Which is awesome if you are fighting over what to have for dinner... pizza or burgers?)  I had the Paradise Pesto. Soooo amazing. Honestly this is some of the best pizza in Phoenix. The crust is PERFECT. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and slightly buttery. The toppings are high quality.   Hubby had the Nitka. He was in homemade sausage and fried onion heaven.   I can't wait to try other menu items. It was so hard to pick because everything looked amazing. They have great vegetarian choices too. I can't wait to try the salads and hubby can't wait to try the wings.   Service is great. Everyone is so nice and truly excited about their food.  BTW... I found out from the owner they are BYOB. There is a liquor store a few doors down. Amaxing pizza... beer... someone put a fork in me. I'm done."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and tried the margarita pizza. Was so amazing service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars is only for the cannoli, have not tried the pizza yet. We were dining at same owners burger place relishing their goods, needed a sweet nightcap but wasn't keen on a milkshake so late at night. I noticed a picture of cannoli on one of the paper menus and became giddy with intrigue and excitement. What a great quirky idea. Not sure how they came up with but it was truly magically delicious. Service was awesome, will return to try pizza soon."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The owner of Paradise Valley Burger Company has another hit! The specialty pizzas are very creative and delicious but you can anything you want on your pie. The Brussels salad is also an amazing accompaniment to the pizzas. You won't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"First time there. Ordered the personal size Paradise Pesto & a Lucky Charm Cannoli. Both were delicious! Personal size was actually bigger than I expected, and full of flavor. Cannoli was perfect! Not too sweet, just perfect. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Pizza in Phoenix! Must try the Brulee or the Phoenix. Both were phenomenal, the Chipotle truffle wings and lucky charms canoli are also incredible. This place is for true food lovers! It's not for the trendy people that like all the hip garbage restaurants popping up serving mediocre food."}
{"text":"They raised the bar pretty high with their bomb hamburgers next door. Now they are doing Pizza? Well I tried it and woah. They did it again. Guys are good. The creativity and quality of ingredients makes this pizza top notch. Now they have the best burgers and best pizza in Phoenix on 1 corner. Props PV Pizza. See you soon."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff were all very friendly.  We had 5 in our party, 3 had burgers from next door and 2 of us had a salad and wings.  I had the Cesar's Caesar salad... delicious!  We had the brown sugar buffalo and BBQ wings, the wings were cooked perfectly and were full of flavor!  I'm looking forward to going back to try the pizza.  Great local restaurant (both pizza and burger) with creative chefs."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Awesome combinations... great flavors! Unique all around... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to try their pizza (their burgers at the sister restaurant are awesome). We got 2 pizzas to go; 1 pepperoni and 1 special (pesto, chicken, ricotta, Parmesan, and red grapes. They were amazing! Just the perfect personal size! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Man this place is so bomb! They just added 20 inch pizzas, and we fed my whole family for $30. Such a steal. I'm from Chicago, and I must say this is the best pizza I've had in phoenix so far hands down. Very friendly staff, the red headed gentleman at the counter was efficient, and the man cooking the pizzas was even friendly! Excited to try the pizza place!"}
{"text":"I tell you what. I'm a fan of Brett's creativity cause I love his burgers at PV Burger. So I had to try his PV Pizza. It's a small little place and reminds me of the same concept as PV Burger. Menus are on the counter and little confused at first but figured it out. They have personal pizza 10\" (four slices) or a larger pizza.   We went for the personal so we can try these different pizza's. I ordered the Pizza Brûlée cause I love the Brûlée burger. It had caramelized onions, ricotta, burnt sugar, beef, bacon, egg, and of course picked onions. It was very good. Just so many flavors going on. Never had a pizza like this. It's just unique. Very different but very good.   My wife got the 1967 Pie which had mushroom, ricotta and red onion but she was able to take out the red onion and add Brussel sprouts. What? Brussel sprouts on a pizza? Unheard of. It was really good. We both enjoyed it. She saw my picked onions and ask the guy if she could get some picked onions. Poured it all over and she just fell in love with this pizza.   The guys at the counter was really good. Very friendly. Very patient with us since it was our first time. Had no problem with my wife wanting substitutes and add-ons. So service was really good.   So overall very good pizza place. Be aware it's not your normal pizza joint. Like I said these are unconventional pizzas. Very good. Only downside is they were a little greasy but I enjoyed. Enjoy. I sure did. For sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Great wings!!! So unique! Loved everything we got! We got 4 types of wings and personal pan pizza.  You literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"It's in a strip mall but don't let it fool you I had the Cardinal Fry's oh my God they're delicious pulled pork fresh cilantro jalapenos my husband had the Paradise Burger with cheese absolutely great I had the booze Burger too bad I didn't have a booze night because this would have been the perfect burger for the next day the Patty is beer battered smothered in Chili's with vodka cream sauce very unique and delicious Burger of course I had to try the Lucky Charms Shake the only thing I was disappointed in it's just ice cream with some lucky charms on top if you're in Phoenix and you want to try a good burger I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"New place in an old pizza spot.  OK pizza.  Not as good as the last pizza place that was there. The customer service was a little better.   Price is at what u would expect. Has potential we will see"}
{"text":"These guys are the best, and their food is fantastic. Make sure to try their burger place next door too!"}
{"text":"Pizza had a nice flavor  just had little toppings that I paid extra for felt sorry for the next guy cause looked like I got all that was left"}
{"text":"I was craving a slice of pizza and garlic bread today. Very nice employees and clean. Pizza and garlic bread was great, going to come by again."}
{"text":"We came to have a Caesar salad. The previous pizza place in this spot made awesome salad. Sadly, the new management in this spot doesn't do that well. They added hot peppers and cilantro and had mediocre dressing. We also tried their Brussel sprout and artichoke salad was mushy and needed texture and maybe some seasoning. Maybe time to forget Top Chef."}
{"text":"The P.V. Company dudes have done it again, but this time with pizza. These dudes did not just wake up one day and think \"you know what I'm good at burgers...I'll try pizza.\" NO ladies and gentlemen the fine people have found a craft, and that craft is FOOD. there is no favorite menu item because everything is absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and I am definitely glad i did! The pizza was so yummy! Fresh out of the oven and so cheesy and delicious! I ordered the the white pizza and my friend ordered the veg. She doesn't like Brussel sprouts so I got to eat them. Nomnomnom"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!   Got the special and it was sooo good!  First burgers and now pizza.  You guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out as I go to the dr near here every couple of weeks. Finally did this evening, just happened to be driving around and what a find! Doesn't look special when you walk in but the guys working were extremely friendly and the Pizza wow! Then on my way out I learned they delivered to me almost 5 miles away. I think I found my new go to, must check out this spot."}
{"text":"Got the Elote pizza after seeing it at the paradise burger co. a couple weeks back. So yummy, I love to get elote at all the Hispanic shops, along the beach, making it at home as well. This pizza is like a munchie masterpiece. The menu is different, the pizza is amazing, the quality is legit, it's thin crust, & the vibe is super chill. Both companies ( don't know if same owner, seems like it) have something about that that sets them apart from other family owned pizza companies. Excited to try other menu items. Also had \"house made Doritos\" while I waited for my pizza to be extra crispy, which was the cutest thing ever, delish too."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of PV Burger Co, I had really high expectations and they definitely did not let me down. We ordered the Brulee, veggie, George and the stone goat, Oreo cannoli, lucky charms cannoli, and maple & bacon wings. Everything was great!  Some of the pizzas may sound crazy, but they mix the flavors just right. Give them a try.  The pizza's are small, ~10\" I'd say, which we didn't know, so I wish we would have ordered more. If you're a big eater like me, know that you could eat at least one pizza by yourself."}
{"text":"This place is a unicorn in a sea of sub par pizza. I have been here 3 times since they opened. Love the burgers and now pizza!!  My new pizza spot hands down. Wings are excellent and unique. They fry then oven baked for crispy goodness!  My only suggestion is get with Uber eats, Postmates, etc so I can get it delivered!  Ignore the guy complaining about the ceaser salad: Who orders a salad at a pizza place anyway? That's like ordering a burger when you're at a pakanstani place."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is awesome!    First, the staff is very fun and friendly.  They are glad to see you, they appreciate your business and most importantly they truly want you to have a memorable experience.  Second, the pizza choices are amazing.  They have two size options; personal and large.  The large can serve as many as five or six people easily.  They complement creative and innovative pizza creations with salads, wings, etc.  By the way the pizza crust is NY City all the way...you fold and eat...cutting with a fork and knife totally not cool.  Third, you'll like this...they have liquor law credentials which allow you to bring your own beer and/or wine.  How sweet is that!   Bottom line, we had an over-the-top experience and look forward to returning in the not too distant future.  PS: they also own Paradise Valley Burgers which is next door."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype was or if the owners are posting five stars! Where do I start!?! There sauce sucks, no flavor nothing special (jar of pizza sauce would of been better)! The dough, was a joke, doesn't even taste like a pizza dough, I think it was something that held the toppings up. And then they put cool ranch Doritos on top thinking they are new and inventive and it dosent work at all! Get the basics down before you open up a pizza shop! No bueno will not last!"}
{"text":"Small pizza location next to their burger mothership.   Order at counter and they bring it out to you.  We ordered the Phoenix and the Ditka Pizza  The Ditka with Sausage and Fried Onions are good, but the pizza is very greasy.   The Phoenix Pizza is sweet  Kind of small pizza but came out hot.  The Paradise Valley Burger Company is awesome, too bad the pizza is not. Don't think it's going to last long"}
