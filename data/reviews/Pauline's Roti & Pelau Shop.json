{"text":"I like the change, the roti is far better than what it was before, the pholourie is not as good but I like the fact that they licensed it now. Great hang out spot late nights,  music, dancing and drinks."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for Roti in Scarborough. Ever since my mom recommended this restaurant to me last year, this is the only place I go to for Curry/Roti. The staff is also very, very friendly. I don't ever write reviews, but try this place out. You will be very surprised."}
{"text":"I have been coming for lunch to this place for years; but today was the last time. I ordered a curry chicken with rice and peas and was not impressed with the lack of taste. I gathered the courage to eat my meal amidst an angry owner cursing over the phone to someone to the top of his lungs. Lodt my apetite.There was no respect for any of the customers whatsoever. Owner should keep in mind that people chose this place for a lunch break over many others nearby. I was also surprised that they passed the food safety inspections when the washroom is a hang out spot for cocroaches. I even took a picture."}
{"text":"Good service. But not the best roti I've tried. I mean if your starving and u live close and there's no McDonald's I guess it's a place to go.  3/5"}
{"text":"Best Roti in all of Toronto, hands down!! I actually now live in the city but will travel east just for this, very worth every bite."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying their roti is not the best I've ever had. My roti was full of chicken with tons of fat on it. I mean eww how can anyone eat like that? My advice is hit the pizza pizza two stores down."}
