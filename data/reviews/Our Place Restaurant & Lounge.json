{"text":"Went there again today and ordered wings. My wife used the bathroom and said it was filthy. 
We got the wings and they were rubbery and tasted like old meat or maybe the were cooked in old oil. 
We were told we were the first ones in 14 years to ever complain about the wings. They took them off the bill though."}
{"text":"We were the only ones in the restaurant at lunch time.  The prices are high and the quality of food is LOW.  My sandwich came with \"home cut fries\".  They tasted old and soggy and like they were cooked in old oil. The price was $8.00 for a sandwich and fries.  This was one of the most reasonable priced sandwiches - burgers with cheese were $9.00!   I did not mentioned this to the server, as I read several other reviews that stated the staff was not very accommodating."}
{"text":"2.5 stars with a little bonus for military discount. (Appreciate that) 

The new owners have dropped the ball and are headed for disaster. The menu is crowded and all over the place. They have deep fried everything, wings, bbq, pizza,burgers salads, sandwiches and I think wraps. It just seems over flowing for a small staff. The server announced that it was a 45 minute wait for a pizza and that they closed in an hour. 45 minutes for a pizza IN a restaurant that only has 9 total people in it? Started off kind put off by this.  So I went to order a burger but was told no ground beef. I hear another customer get told there was no green peppers, in a place known for pizza. The server was trying his best but he's just not cut out for serving. Slow and tooooo apologetic(again 2 tables most of the time.) He kept coming by and saying \"hey im gonna take care of xyz then ill be back with you\" and still took kinda long.  So I finally land on the rueben sandwich. It comes out thin with bland meat, practically no Sauerkraut and no thousand island dressing. (For 12 bucks!) The saving grace for me was the onion rings with some  BBQ sauce were excellent. My wife's chicken tenders were VERY TOUGH. I feel they suffer from inventory issues on food and lack of staff. Pros are discounts for city workers and military and a pretty solid happy hour."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family. There were 6 of us, but the place was fairly empty considering we showed up before the rush. The food took over 45 minutes, and the server was bringing out one dish at a time. My mother's pork was completely undercooked and had a hair on it. My brother's French Dip also had a hair in the french fries. We asked to see the manager who made excuses and was extremely rude concerning our complaints. Looking into the kitchen, I noticed 2 cooks with no hairnets and full facial hair. We will NEVER be returning."}
{"text":"A friend and I like to try new places especially local businesses. We are all about giving and hoping that were surprised by a great meal and great service. However when we first got to our place the restaurant was empty when we went at a time when the restaurant wasn't that busy we got there around 2 p.m. I'm pretty sure we got the only server that was working at the time and for us that wasn't a good thing. As nice as she was she just wasn't a great server we had to ask for our first round of drinks more than once we didn't get the sauces that we asked for and she got her order messed up twice. The menu looks great and we were super excited to try some of the flavors on it however it just didn't deliver our food wasn't bad but it was very greasy and just mediocre lacking lots of flavor. I was even more mortified when I walked into the bathroom with my 4 year old son and he lifted up the seat to go potty. It was one of the most disgusting bathrooms I've ever seen in a restaurant which can only make me think that the kitchen is not much cleaner. Towards the end of our meal my friend ordered a cup of coffee when it came out it was in a black coffee mug that was absolutely filthy you could see crusty stuff all over the outside along with fingerprints and food and everything else. What does great is the menu sounded I hope that someday they fix these issues because this restaurant has a lot of great potential and I'd love to go back and try some of the stuff on there pizza menu."}
{"text":"The first time we went was good; so we decided to go back.  Last night 3/16/13 it was awful food was good service sucked.  Had 2 hudge parties kitchen and wait staff couldnt handle it; I will not return."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this place a second try... Dingy, dirty, dine-in area. Hostess was abrupt, unaccommodating, condescending, and not willing to honor gift certificates towards their establishment. The food was nothing special- especially for the price (which was too high). Overall, this restaurant is NOT worth your time and you are better off walking across the street for fast food... To top off our experience, other customers were sick in the restroom (vomiting). I hate writing bad reviews but this one is well deserved."}
{"text":"I am giving Our Place 3 stars overall. They have a good Reuben sandwich, but anything else we have gotten from here has been okay at best. We also have had much better experience when we get food to go (call in first or else you will be waiting awhile) than when we eat in.

The restaurant is dated in that it looks like the old Pizza Hut buildings from the 80's. The service when eating in has also been pretty slow and unfriendly. If we only had experience eating in and had not tried the Reubens we probably would never return. However when ordering and doing carryout on this single dish it is a good deal.

Other dishes I have had include fried chicken which was okay (still a three star out of five) and the pizza (I may have to dip to a one star out of five here). Based on experiences with those dishes I don't think I could try any other dishes for fear of extreme disappointment and wasted money. I definitely wouldn't recommend eating in, but if you want a decent Reuben to go this may fit the bill."}
{"text":"First time getting food there and watched them prepare food while we were waiting. They never used gloves when dealing with any of the food and also would stick their fingers in the salad dressing containers and lick them. Gross!! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Since their are new owners,  the food is amazing. The baked beans are really good. The steak was done perfect"}
{"text":"This place is waaaaaaaaaaay over priced. The pizza is good, but the pasta was very disappointing. Also, they need to update the look of the place.  I live 3/4 of a mile away and end up passing this place every time we go out to dinner. Even for pizza because their prices are so high.  All in all it's overrated at best."}
{"text":"We went there on Fridau evening at 7pm. The servers didn't seem to want to do their job. Took 15 minutes to finally get a server. We ordered water and a Pepsi. It never came. I stopped the hostess and asked where out server was and she said over there and walked the opposite direction. We left after we ordered dinner because we never did receive our drinks. I used to go to this place all the time and was hoping things would be better with this new owner but obviously its not. Don't waste your time. Good thing Pizza Hut is across the street."}
{"text":"Ok, so my first review of Our Place was based on a pizza and beer experience.  Since that time, I returned to have an entree experience.  Bottom line, I will maintain the 4 for the pizza (especially the white pizza), but have to give a 2 for the entrees (at least the ones that my husband and I tried)...my recommendation...stick to the pizza and beer."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. I called to order a pizza this evening and had a 50% off coupon from one of those large coupon books that I purchased for a fundraiser. The woman that answered the phone was  one of the rudest people that I have encountered in a very long time. She was pleasant until I mentioned that I had a coupon and boy did her demeanor change after that!  She practically demanded to know where the coupon was from and when I told her I couldn't remember the name of the book, she then acted as if I was trying to scam her and rudely stated \" we don't take expired coupons\". I then asked her, \"why would you assume I'm trying to use an expired coupon?\" She then huffed and said \"what do you want on your Pizza?\" again in an extremely rude tone. I proceeded to say never mind and promptly ordered my pizza from Aces Grille and will never patronize Our Place again. Maybe it's OK if you don't try to use Coupons!!"}
{"text":"Took my children there for the lunch buffet the other day and this is the WORST restaurant I have ever been to! The floor was sticky. The buffet had no food on it. They told me when I was coming in that fresh pizza and wings would be out in a few minutes. About 25 minutes later, nothing. I had to ask. I should have just left. The pizza tasted awful! The wings were old, cold and gross. The service was awful! If you only have 2 tables, who are ordering from a buffet, what excuse do you have that it took 15 minutes for water and not bringing silverware and napkins to the table? Oh and not to mention there were no plates at the buffet. Then when they brought more they were dirty!! Thank goodness we didn't get sick. NEVER eat here, EVER! I will never go there again!"}
