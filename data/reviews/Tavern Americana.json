{"text":"The beer selection wax slight but those they had were good, and the happy hour prices excelled.  the tavern burger was geat, cooked to my specs and big and juicey.  Burger and beer give me a reason to go back."}
{"text":"We've been coming here regularly every other month or so since they've opened.  The owner, Tim, is a great guy and he makes sure every customer is happy.  Wait staff is always friendly and efficient. Matt the bartender isn't afraid to go off menu and make some interesting drinks tailored to your likes.

This has always been a \"cheers where everyone knows your name\" kind of place for us with good modern twists on bar food.  The ingredients are always fresh and local as much as possible.  Our favorites are always the patty melt, the steak salad, and the mad Hawaiian pizza--they make some pretty awesome pizzas out of their pizza oven.  

They just hired a new chef to lead up the kitchen and Tavern Americana is bringing their A game.  We were in two weeks ago and the chef had a special of home made chicken and dumplings.  I wasn't too sure about eating such a heavy soul food dish when it's 110 degrees out but I thought I'd give it a try.  I was so glad I did.  Flavorful broth, fresh veggies, tender chicken, and dumplings as light as air.  It reminded me somewhat of my wife's matzoh ball soup which is about one of the best things I've ever had.

We were in last night to see what else chef Ian had in store.  We tried the pasta Bolognese special. It was fantastic.  Home made pasta cooked to perfection.  The Bolognese sauce was rich and had a deep meaty flavor.  This is one of the best pasta Bolognese dishes in town--I'm not kidding.  We also had the fried chicken, which is only on Fridays.  Wow.  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, yet not greasy at all.  For dessert, another one of chef Ian's new additions--a sort of deconstructed bananas foster bread pudding.  The four of us were literally arm wrestling for the last bite.

If you haven't been to TA in a while--check it out and make sure to try what chef Ian is cooking.  You'll thank me later.

And P.S.--if you like bourbon, ask Matt to make the western rye (not on the menu).  It's kind of like a Manhattan.  Has some bitter, has some smoke.  But first he coats the inside of the glass with some absinthe to give the drink a licorice finish.  If you have a few, you'll thank me later.  Just make sure there's not a huge surge in uber."}
{"text":"went two nights ago. Upcharge for Martini was $2.00 for Smirnoff bringing it to $8.00. Salmon was the salty side of the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea. Worst we have ever had despite the manager saying it was the best. Green chile was good but again salty. My wift threw up upon getting home. Will not return. The $15.00 coupon was not worth it."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great green chile pork and fries!  Organic greens, nice neighborhood spot with patio, service can be hit or miss..."}
{"text":"Really hate to have to have to come edit my review after moving into the area this was my boyfriend and I's favorite hang out spot. However, we went the other day for happy hour and our Montana drivers license were denied because they appeared to be fake by the owner. My family and I own our own restaurants and I understand the position he was in. But how he handled the situation was absolutely uncalled for and rather embarassing on his part. Very rude. He informed us that he went to college in Missoula, Montana and he knows for a fact that Montana drivers license do not look like ours did. Little did he know, in the past five years they have changed their appearance. I will never go back in there, nor will I ever recommend this place to anybody. After this, we weren't even waited on for the rest of the time there. No drink refills, no nothing. I don't recommend anybody supporting such an operation ran as poorly as this one."}
{"text":"Strongly recommend. All fresh and delicious. Had the green chilli pork off the starter menu and it was fanomanal. Simple salad was the best salad I have ever had. The burger was amazing and cooked perfectly. The fries are delicious. The beer selection is superb. The live music was great. Chris C was our server and probably the best service I have ever had. Overall 6 Stars if that was possible. Get the extra star because everything is made in house and comes from local vendors. A must dine place."}
{"text":"First off, let me start off by saying that Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. There's something on the menu for everyone, whether it be appetizers, beer, cocktails, or entrees. The atmosphere is fantastic. The service is always great, and food and drinks are always out fast. I really love eating outside on the patio since the weather is getting cooler."}
{"text":"Not sure why this has 4 stars. Pizzas had been setting for a while before they were served. They were barely warm. Guac was nothing special. Over priced  too if it weren't for happy hour. Too many choices in the area to come back."}
{"text":"This is a go to spot. Good food, good service, nice relaxed atmosphere. Good selection of beers. Traditional American food."}
{"text":"We recently visited this place on a Saturday night and it was so-so.  The food seemed overpriced for what you get and the pizza was average at best. We ordered a pear salad with chicken to start and it was very small for the $12 price. It had good flavor but not worth the money. The wood fired pizza was bland and small. The one positive was the bartender was really efficient and nice, and even though the kitchen messed up the food order, he offered to get me a glass of wine to make up for the error. I really appreciated the good service and he corrected the mistake quickly. I may stop back in to try the burgers but for pizza, no chance."}
{"text":"Its 1:30 am and i am awake because i am still tasting the propane flavored hamburger.  Service was friendly and fast but both meals were lukewarm which leads me to believe made ahead of time and kept warmish.   Horrible.  Will not return a second time after reading poor reviews from others"}
{"text":"First of all they are in Scottsdale.....you can't charge $13 for a burger made from Ground Chuck....that's the worst meat out there and it costs under a dollar a pound at the store! 

Second - premium liquors are NOT Cuervo and Smirnoff!

Pizza was ok but could use more INGREDIENTS for what they charge! 

The decor Inside makes it Feel cold and unfinished! Soooo disappointed!  :("}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service is equally good, and the prices are good too. We go there all the time and every experience has been great. One of the best restaurants around. Everything about it is 5 stars."}
{"text":"We've been their 3 times since finding out about it a few weeks back and have been extremely satisfied each visit.  What drew us there is the beer selection.  My husband and I are beer geeks, and often our dining out is limited to establishments that serve an IPA.  They have a great selection of beers on tap - 20 fixed beers with several rotating handles.  Matt the bartender also gets specialty bottles not on the menu.  We had a Palate Wrecker bomber last night which was fantastic.  The Racer 5 on tap is a fantastic IPA, and was very fresh.  If Miller is your beverage of choice you're SOL :).  

The food we've had was very good.  Beet Salad with chicken was fresh with quality ingredients; tavern burger was fantastic, amazing quality to the beef, cooked perfectly, one of the best burgers I've had in years.  Reminded me of Hamburger Hamlet as a kid.  My huband got the classic pizza, loved it and added some of my burger to it.  We had the roasted chicken and fillet previously which were both very good as well.

Service has been great all 3 times.  We've only sat at the high-tops in the bar area so we can't comment on the floor seating.  On our first visit, she sent the bartender over after learning we enjoyed beer and Matt told us about Palate Wrecker which was not on the menu.  It would be nice if all the beers not on menu were listed on the chalkboard,  but it was easy enough to learn about them.  Our server remembered us on our second visit and that we enjoy IPAs.  Our drinks and food orders were delivered promptly each time and she followed up to ensure our food orders were to our liking.  She has nice positive energy.

Ambiance- I like the indoor-outdoor feel with the large doors leading to the patio.  Nice open feel inside with large, butcher block high tops in the bar area.  We've been there during the week and on a Friday after 8:30 and haven't had a problem getting a bar table.

To address a couple prior reviews- the cut of meat in a burger should not correlate with price- it's the quality and how it's prepared.  I've had prime fillet elsewhere that tasted like liver because the quality and cooking were sub-par.  The beef at Tavern Americana is from Niman Ranch, it was prepared perfectly, and tasted great.

We're not that into happy hours because we both work late, but I agree they should change their HH policy regarding beers.  I don't expect the craft beers to be priced the same as Coors because kegs of premium craft beer are sometimes twice as expensive as crappy American macros (we have a quad kegerator at home so we know :) ), it would be hard to include all of their craft beers in one low happy hour pricing and make any money at all.  It makes more sense to decrease the price of the craft beers a buck or so and offer Coors at 2.50. Matt said they are considering adding a couple of the craft beers to the HH menu if it makes sense to them.  As beer lovers, we were lured in by their list, and HH availability or not we will keep coming back.  I'll gladly pay $5 for a pint of fresh Racer 5. For comparison Racer 5 is normally $6.50 at Yard House, around $5 for YH HH.

Bottom line- for us it's great- close to home, great beer and great food.  Does it have the best beer list in town- no, that would be Papago and Yard House; is it the best food in town, no; does it have the best combination of craft beer AND good food- maybe..."}
{"text":"Horrible Food Quality; took my family on 4/24/17 (a Monday evening), it was my son's 11 year old  birthday dinner.  We went because we saw a captivating promotional spot on channel 12.  My expectations were somewhat high because every pizza, sandwich, and burger platter started at around $14.  I also thought that going on a Monday evening would be in my favor because it wasn't busy.  The buffalo chicken pizza was too overly tangy with sauce to the extent that it ruined the taste.  The chicken pesto pizza tasted foul and a bit gamey.  The burger patty was thin and the bun was huge but falling a part.  French fries were ok, but the server only brought a small side of ketchup, I repeatedly had to request for more ketchup.  The entire dinner came to be $75, it was incredibly over priced, i felt taken advantage of by the tv promotional spot.  Wish I went to Cheesecake Factory, BJ's or even Red Robin.  The worst part is that it was my son's birthday dinner and I can't redo the memory.  I wish restaurants, especially after a news channel promo, would put way more care and attention into their product."}
{"text":"ate here for first time.  service was good.  food was okay.  fries came out cold. had to return them for hot ones.  ordered the pulled pork.  came with cole slaw on it which mixed in and then looked like paste.  not very appetizing but I was hungry so I ate it.  so many good places in Scottsdale not going back here"}
{"text":"Waited 10 min upon arrival for any service.  Only 6 tables filled. Food was nothing to rave about. Waited 20 minutes to get bill and only then after we found another waiter to get it. Very poor service if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"We were in the area and searched for a place for dinner, tried this place thanks to Yelp. The decor is cute, clean and friendly. We sat at the bar and were waited on immediately. I was indecisive on which beer to get, the bartender was very knowledgable about the beers on draft and was helpful. Our food was delicious, too. I got one of the pizzas and my husband got the green chile burger. He even ate the kale in the side salad (which I could never get him to eat kale at home, let alone pay for it!) All in all, a great neighborhood place! We will be back."}
{"text":"Perfect...  Ambiance, food, wait staff.  We came because the restaurant we wanted to go to had their ovens down.  Now we will make this spot a first choice."}
{"text":"very professional service and atmosphere.  Went late one night after Barrett Jackson, server was very attentive, food came out quickly, no complaints.  Review the menu before you go to make sure it is what you want because there is not a lot of variety.  Someone vegetarian is not going to be happy here."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here with about 25 people, it was perfect. They were very attentive and accommodating. All the food was tasty and the drinks were cold. It was a great evening and would recommend it to others looking for a party venue."}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice, but service was at best average.  It seemed the restaurant was understaffed....I waited 15 minutes to put an order.   The food was unfortunately probably the worst I ever had in North Scottsdale... the half roasted chicken was the SMALLEST I have ever seen and potatoes were greasy.  I did mention to our waiter the chicken was also dry and he acknowledged, but did not even ask as if I wanted anything else instead.  Very disappointed with this place.... there are so many better choices near by....."}
{"text":"Great place. Great service. Had the salmon. Excellent and cookie dough desert also wonderful"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with this new Resturant. It was very well decorated with excellent lighting. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks then ordered the French fries with their own ketchup, it was amazing! The bartender was very helpful. We are going back tomorrow for lunch.
Great addition to the Grayhawk area."}
{"text":"My daughter and I along with four other families visited a few weeks ago ...middle of a sat afternoon....terrible service....we will never go back..."}
{"text":"Kelsey is amazing!!!! Best server ever!! Always come here! Not too bad on $$ and the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Saturday nite dinner, perfect ribs falling off bone, my wife had the Quiana salad with salmon, great cocktails, fast service, friendly and great food 

We will be back"}
{"text":"Food is good, there is no denying that, but the service was some of the worst I have ever seen. They served us at a table of 10 and then took an hour and 10 minutes to serve us. They said they wanted to serve us all at the same time, but then they bring some people their soup. They all served several groups that got there much later than us before we got served. And oir servers were unpleasant and did even apologize for the wait. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and terrible experience.  Went around 6 and the place was empty (should have been our first clue!).  Sat in the dinning room but had to go to the bar ourselves for any drinks including water.  Food took over 30 min to come out - salmon was so fishy it smelled like it might still be swimming!  I think the turkey burger was actually spam it was totally gross.  After taking one bite of food two of us left and ate elsewhere.  Other two stayed and struggled through and then had to suggest to the server that they take the other two entrees off the check (each had one bite and that's it) which she finally did after \"checking with her manager\".  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"We will give this place another try in the near future because I like the atmosphere and service was great, however, I agree with previous reviews about food coming out cold :( I've never had an experience of ordering wings and having the inside of the wings being lukewarm/ on the colder side. That leads me to believe it's not fresh? Being reheated? Maybe we will try something else next time"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. The wife had the chicken sandwich and it was luke warm. I had the pizza which was just ok. The biggest issue was we were sitting next to a couple with a kid that was throwing rocks around the patio and no one would do anything to stop her.

Service was just average. We won't be back. There are a lot of restaurants that have better food and a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place truly deserves five stars for a tavern.  Let's start with hamburger quality.   A+. The meat tasted very fresh very very good.  Mine came out perfect as ordered.

The french fries were good the chicken wings were awesome & the beer selection was perfect.

Our waiter was polite and very helpful.

The restaurant itself is very clean modern Tavern a nice comfortable touch.  The bar has TVs.

I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food and even better staff. Happy hour was perfect. I highly recommend taking a large group of you are looking for a good time"}
{"text":"We hosted 50 people here for dinner before the Phoenix Open concert and it was wonderful. Christine was great, staff was awesome and clients were happy! Thank you - we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here one evening to have a quick dinner and catch some of the Post-Season baseball games. The server and manager were amazing for switching the tv to the game we were looking for. The nachos were excellent and our entrees were good. The Happy Hour pricing was great too!"}
{"text":"I want to say our bartender was kind of inattentive, but then I realized....the entire time this guy was working he was going 100mph. This guy was running everywhere. Bartender 5/5 Restaurant 3.5/10 


Solid food, great beer selection."}
{"text":"Oh yeah... I like!  This is a regular spot... The greens for the salads are just ... soooo good!  I have had most of the lunch menu... and I would rave about most of it! The Steak Salad is my favorite... the Green Chili burger slides in second..."}
{"text":"Great food and great waiter. Kyle was awesome. The Diet Coke stayed full. He was there when we needed something but not hovering. Very happy with tonight's meal."}
{"text":"We randomly decided to pop into Tavern Americana after a day trip to Tucson and needed a restaurant on a Saturday night that could fit a party of six.  We were able to get in no problem, since I assume people are just starting to find out about this place.  My first impression was that this restaurant needed a boost in the decor department.  I loved the garage door walls, but otherwise it was just gray and drab with nothing hanging on any of the walls really.  Besides the decor, it was loud and bustling in the restaurant, so the overall vibe was good.

After sitting down, our waitress greeted us, but it took awhile to get our drink/food order.  She seemed overwhelmed and all over the place really.  Once she did focus on us, she offered some suggestions and we all placed our orders.  I had the beet salad and added chicken.  Everyone else had different dishes, so I did get to taste some of the other items.  I LOVED my salad.  The grilled chicken was awesome and the beets were cooked perfectly.  The salad met/exceeded all my expectations and was rather large.  The Hubs had the gnocci and seemed to like it, but it was rather small.  I must mention we tried to order a couple appetizers, but they were already out for the day, which was kinda sad.  To top off the meal we had the cookie and apple fritters.  OMG that cookie is to die for, and I consider myself a cookie connoisseur, so you can take that review to the bank... you'll love it.

All and all, for a place close to home with good quality food, we will surely be back soon.  Hopefully they will add something to the walls and perfect their service.  If they do that, surly they'll have a winner!"}
{"text":"So we tried a new place for \"happy hour\" or in their words \"happiest hour\".  So we look at the happy hour menu & check out their drinks and appetizers.  The drinks are $4.95 BUT she tells me if I order a lemon drop martini that they only use real juice (we live in Arizona and lemons are abundant) so that will be $2 extra-ok fine.  Then we order the guacamole with chips to start with and she comes back and says-avacados are expensive now so that will be an extra $2 added on (NOTE:  BASHA'S is selling them 4 for $1--yikes that is expensive lol) to the $7.95 price that is on their happy hour menu.  Also, when we ordered the green chili pork it comes with one tortilla that you need to tear apart and it is steaming hot when you get it.  Well one wasn't enough so she asked if we wanted a second-we said sure-that's a $1 more of course.  I've been to several establishments where you get unlimited amount of chips (which in essence is tortillas cut up and deep fried) with no extra charge so this is also ridiculous.  Needless to say NOT going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is open and airy. Never too crowded. Nice clientele. Every dish coming from the kitchen looks delicious. I can attest that the grilled steak and grilled chicken is some of the best I've ever had. One of my top 10 favorite salads is the Grilled Niman Ranch Steak Salad. The steak is always an excellent grill at a good medium. Piled high are arugula, parmigiano cheese, pickled red onion, tomato, and balsamic dressing. I CRAVE THIS SALAD. The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is due to the service. It's hit or miss but even at that, it sucks. There always seems to be manager doing paperwork near the front door so it's surprising even to me that this is a continuous problem. I won't get started because Yelp will not give me enough to room to finish my thoughts. Give this place a try but have patience  because the food is truly worth it."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area on a Saturday night and decided to give this restaurant a try. It was a very good choice. They offer both patio and restaurant seating, with large garage doors that open to bring the patio inside. They have an extensive bar with many beers on tap. The menu is diverse from pizza to burgers. We decided to try their burgers. They offer two different ones. One is the \"green monster,\" a green chili cheeseburger, served on a fresh potato bun. You have a choice of a side salad or fries. The burger was cooked perfectly to the med-rare, as ordered. The fries were hand cut with the skins on,and fresh. The burgers use organic fresh beef. The service was efficient and friendly. The restaurant offered two dinner special, including salmon. They offer several wood stove pizzas, from their open oven.  We would definitely return to try the pizza next time..."}
{"text":"Really terrific menu.  Steak, pasta, salads, seafood, pizza and more! Signature chipotle shrimp boat is to die for!  Great atmosphere, great friendly service, located in the heart of Beautiful North Scottsdale in Grayhawk."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal after a looonnng day traveling. Friendly and competent staff"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this restaurant 5 FLYS!



...couldn't eat my food b/c flys kept landing on it...disgusting! Waitress never asked why I didn't eat my food! Flys all over the restaurant! Went there b/c Yelp had it's 4 stars...never again"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Super friendly staff. Very accommodating with food allergies.  I was able to order a bunless burger and salad no problem. Even going there at 730pm on a Friday night, we were able to walk right in. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would go back to try more food, and the menu does offer something for everyone. However, service was not great and when they say Spicy, they overdo it. I have never had cole slaw that was so hot I could not eat, I wish they would have offered an option. We were there about 6pm and the sun was unbearable, 2 people in our party were blinded (we were inside) and there were no shades to pull and no options offered, other tables were also complaining. the waiter while very nice, was not the greatest. Had to ask twice for water, then only brought to me without asking others. Poured tea into a Bloody Mary with no offer to replace, brought 1 entree out with the salad which should have come with dinner, got checks wrong. 
Suggest that they offer levels of spicy and get some shades. Also, when arrived, the bar tender was talking to other employees and took quite awhile to come and get our drink order, we were the only ones at the bar."}
{"text":"1st visit. Mid Sunday afternoon before heading to the airport.

Big upgrade from O'Donoghue's, previously at this location.

Very good tap beer menu. 

House made hummus w/ pita, fresh made and hot from the oven. Fabulous.

The Green Monster burger was very good, high quality Niman beef. 

Excellent service (Matthew). Comfortable atmosphere. Plenty of TV screens in the bar for sports fans.

Convenient location for Grayhawk residents"}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food and a great draft selection. I was ecstatic to find an upscale pub so close to home. Their ingredients are usually local, and their bartenders know what they are talking about. Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Plenty of TVs to watch the games.  Chef Patrick Fegan and his partners of TK Urban Tavern in Scottsdale Quarter just opened this great location.  Pumpkin Soup with pumpkin oil and croutons is such a great start to the Fall season.  Wood fired oven pumping out flatbreads.  Sweet Potato gnocchi made in house with roasted corn and gorgonzola crema is unbelievable.  

Very impressive selection of beer handles and delicious cocktails.   Amazing view of the sunset as well.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich is super duper good!!! Tender, juicy, thinly sliced, very flavorful! 

Also had the quinoa salad which was served warm but I felt would have been better served slightly cold. Otherwise, very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm torn here. We went on a tuesday night for dinner before going to a movie. I noticed the \"green monster\" burger and googled to find out it was a second location of TKs in Scottsdale Quarter, who's food I have found to be bland at best the many times I have visited. The hostess was spacy and very \"scottsdale\"- no smile, no emotions, just looked at us dead faced and sat us on the patio and stomped off. Our server, however, was amazing. We got two White Rascals and ordered dinner. My bf had a burger, and I ordered a steak- MEDIUM RARE. Well when we got our food the steak came out well done. Thankfully the waitress insisted that they make me another and let me nibble on the one in front of me. The thing I noticed was how bland it was, just beyond bland. The green beans were great, and our server was awesome, but then the second steak came and it too was almost well done. I am a huge steak lover but it was super disappointing."}
{"text":"We come here for the amazing bartender...who I believe manages the bar.  The food is average at best....but we come for his great service and expertise on craft beers and cocktails.  The amosphere  here is great.  If they improved the food...think it could be a true destination in the area."}
{"text":"The jalapeño cocktail is excellent!  The chipotle shrimp appetizer was great and the kids liked the Tots.  I don't recommend the tortilla soup though.   Good chicken tenders & cheese pizza for kids!  The waiter was very nice & the atmosphere is comfortable/trendy/clean"}
{"text":"We are always on the look out for new pubs and craft beer kitchens.  This is our new favorite in the north Scottsdale area!  They have a great rotating beer list and most/all of the food is made in-house, including the ketchup!  We've enjoyed the Chicken Pesto Pizza and both the Pulled Pork and the Steak sandwich.  My favorite is probably the Steak Sandwich that includes a nice horseradish sauce!  We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Well so everyone else knows, call before you go here because they sometimes they close their whole restaurant for private parties. Guess this is just a downside of being a popular place."}
{"text":"Ordered the tavern double burger with tots. Licked the plate clean. Good food and good service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant in Scottsdale turned out to be surprisingly good, though lacked just a couple of things for me to rate it a full 5 stars.  In short, the food selection was excellent, beer & wine choices aplenty, but the ambiance suffers a bit due to a very basic covering of the walls and very little sound dampening.  It was very loud from neighboring tables and was hard to have our own conversation!

Our server was very knowledgeable on the beer offerings (extensive), and picked out a Four Peaks Kiltlifter for me that turned out to be very good (I had never had it before).  As for the food, I had the Grilled Pork Tenderloin, which is served with butternut squash puree, sauteed green beans, and warm apple compote.  Very delicious!  The only suggestion I have for the chef would be to add a small portion of starch, say some baby reds or mashed potatoes.  Our server also agreed with this. :-)

The dessert also impressed - the Cookie Dough Skillet is a large, fresh baked, warm chocolate chip cookie in an iron skillet, topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  OMG this was GOOD!!  

With decent service, and outstanding food, I rate this 4 stars only because of the environment issues with too much noise."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly bartenders, solid beer selection, and really above the board bar food.  The green Chile pork is a must, and the burgers are great.  Wood fired pizza is worth a try too.  

Great bar atmosphere.  Hang out and have fun!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place for cocktails. There are some really tasty ones on their list. Matt at the bar is awesome! If you feel like being adventuresome he'll make you anything you want and if he doesn't know the recipe he'll look it up for you! And there ain't nothin wrong with bacon loaded mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"Loved the Fish & Chips here.  Service was very good too."}
{"text":"A place for just about everyone! Had a little work lunch here the other day, and it was perfect. This place has everything. From lunch, brunch, dinner, happy hour, greasy foods, to good for you food, even a nice little brick oven. I got the Grilled Niman Ranch Steak Salad: Wild arugula, vine ripe tomato, pickled red onion, parmigiano cheese, balsamic syrup. The only thing I would change is I wanted more salad ;). The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Arugula was nice and crisp. I would re-order that any day. I want to come back for happy hour, the cute patio, and to try the Green Chile Pork Appetizer. A few of my co-workers highly recommended it! This was a very cool, open, modern, rustic feeling, place with large high-tops, 1/2 booths & tables, nice patio, a great bar with a large selection of craft beers, wine, and liquor.. I really enjoyed this place, I can't wait to come after work hours to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The only complaint is that the food I order came up to fast. :-)"}
{"text":"Great beer and light food.  I love the Barrio Rojo Scottish Style Ale   My favorite appetizer is the Green Chile Pork

Ya'll come by- hear?"}
{"text":"My wife and I love to come here. I'm giving this place a 4 star only because the last two times the service wasn't as good. As for the food I have zero complaints and their salmon is by far my favorite in the valley!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, my burger was good. 

We had a serious problem with our take out order. 

Ordered a plain kids burger without cheese for my daughter with dairy allergy. My husband picked up the food and brought it to the park where we were eating. 

The burger had cheese!! How difficult is it to make a plain burger with no cheese? Also we were given no utensils, and I had a salad, no mayo, no ketchup, no condiments and no napkins! And we were at the park. 

I called back and asked for them to remake the kids burger, no cheese. My husband goes back to get it. It was a burger patty in a box with NO BUN!!! What the heck is going on in this place? So my kid ate French fries for dinner because we weren't going back AGAIN (they would probably mess it up again anyway, I now have zero confidence in this place, they all seem brain dead...). 

The manager Ian offered us nothing. He credited the kids meal which was cheap anyway. It cost my husband more money in gas to go there and back twice, we didn't get to eat our dinner together as a family due to all the running back and forth, and my child still had nothing to eat despite TWO trips there. If I was the manager I would have deleted the entire bill. Really bad customer service and total incompetence. Never again.

Oh and when I finally got a fork to eat my salad, it tasted dirty :/"}
{"text":"Decided we wanted to take the family out for dinner and landed at the doorstep of Tavern Americana. 

Large restaurant, t.v.s throughout, nice large bar that is separate from the dining area. 

We came with our kids so we knew that burgers and or pizza was going to be ordered that evening. As far as appetizers go, we got the Diablo tots which were indeed good. 

3 of the 5 in our family ordered burgers. Honestly, there isn't anything special about the burgers. One of the kids ordered the pizza, he ate it all so it must have been good. I ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, I couldn't finish it, the arugula was too overpowering. Thought they would have mixed the arugula with some spring mix, I was wrong. 

One thing that had us talking was the kids menu. My 8 year old daughter ordered off of it, she got a burger and with that burger, she would also get an ice cream. On the kids menu they put that in no way will they let you take the ice cream to go, the way it was written was so unprofessional. It must have been an issue with families with kids wanting to get the ice cream off the kids menu to go. We all know when we have little kids, by the time dessert comes they are tired, so why not put the ice cream in a little cup and let the parents take them home WITH their ice cream? The only alternative is that you keep the tired kids there to get their ice cream and let other paying customers hear tired kids. LOL, doesn't make sense. Give parents the option to get the ice cream to go for their tired kids! It's almost comical how they have it written on the menu, almost insulting to parents."}

{"text":"The manager, Ryan, was exceptional. We went in to watch the Blackhawks game and decided we wanted to more of a \"Chicago\" bar. We hadn't ordered a thing and Ryan was more than happy to not only find a bar (since we are new to the are) but he actually called and made a reservation for us. We will definitely be back to Tavern Americana because of the amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot with parents and grandparents.  Food was great everyone enjoyed their food. As a big beer guy I enjoyed their local and regional beer selection had a few different ones. Venue was nice modern \"tavern\" with a brick oven pizza set up and wine room.  (It was upscale don't let tavern turn u away) Their were two private rooms one for about 12 and one larger one good for small events. It was mid summer so we did not get to enjoy the open air dining room and patio. As it was 112 I was happy to enjoy ac instead.  All and all it was a great experience and I will be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"Two years since my first review... Still love this place!  Great place for good food with a solid bar.   Plenty of TV's to catch all games."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I eat lunch here at least once every week. Only criticism is that they need to change up the menu a bit. A must try."}
{"text":"Matt makes the best Manhattans around plus he's a great guy and bartender. Always friendly and wants to make sure you are having a nice meal. True professional."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and helpful! Ashley is so sweet and attentive. Great place for lunch and dinner, the salmon salad is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on afternoon. Brought the kiddo. The place was empty save for a few bar flies. The Mac and cheese for the kiddo was amazing. He loved and and so did we. The pizza while good intentioned was below average. The quality of the toppings was low. Especially the pepperoni. It's weird to spend so much money on decor and ambiance and than try to save pennies on cheap pepperoni. No one comes back for pepperoni that curls up. Cmon. Had a couple other dishes and everything was just ho-Hum. The server/bartender was friendly and accommodating.
An awkward interaction was happening right at the front door for a while between their chef and a manager. Deft a conversation to have in the back out of earshot of the guests. They have to figure some things out for sure. Make decisions that benefit and improve the guests experience. Focus on making dollars not saving pennies."}
{"text":"From the fresh and absolutely delicious food, to the great service, this place is definitely the neighborhood hangout! We have fun watching all the games here, and are obsessed with the amazing wings, plus the green chili pork is perfectly spicy and yummy:)"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The green chili pork is FN great. Staff is way better than Local BISTRO. 
Sweet outdoor patio and brick oven pizzas. I highly recommend to check this place out! ENJOY!!!

{"text":"Went here for a group event and giving it two stars ONLY because the parking was easy and the front room is nice and accommodates a big group easily with lots of Windows. 

However, the rest of the experience was a huge disappointment. We only had one, maybe two waiters helping us and we had about 30 people. Because of this terrible ratio, almost all of our orders were wrong and we had to ask for water multiple times. Not to mention our server was rude and acted like we were inconveniencing him (I'm sure he didn't feel that way when he received the mandatory 20% gratituity on our huge bill). It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty otherwise. Food was decent but the service was so terrible, we likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I live pretty much down the street from here but I had went for the first time last weekend. I must say, I liked it! I think they are the same people that urban tavern was run by, which was a family favorite before it was taken out. 
The menu had a good variety and it was not busy on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated and helped right away. Unfortunately of the whole almost empty restaurant, we were seated next to packers fans who were literally yelling and singing the whole time haha. But other than that our experience was good.
We started off with pretzels and cheese and omg I could've had that as a meal. I can be pretty picky with cheese sauces, but this one was really good. The pretzels were warm and soft too, yummy. For my meal I decided to get a build your own pizza. I had it with pesto, mozzarella, goat cheese, and caramelized onions. It turned out soooo good. Also the pizza was huge for its price! I brought almost half home. My dad got a margherita pizza and it was good too. My sister said her chicken sandwich was too spicy and didn't like it, but that was the only complaint. Service wasn't bad either. Good eats here!"}
{"text":"The food is average, but I plan to give it another try.  I came with my husband and two sons.  They all ordered burgers and no-one thought they were anything more than Ok.  I ordered the Southwestern Chicken salad and it was adequate.

The service was slow and it was not super busy, not sure if they were short staffed or not?"}
{"text":"I don't know what I like better: the good service, incredibly satisfying home cooking, the mellow rustic environment, fair prices...this place blew me away. 

My boyfriend and I stumbled in here while we were hangry, ready for the infamous Mac & Cheese. I started with a vodka specialty cocktail and he got a glass of Pinot Noir, both were dangerously tasty. 

I was pleased to see the Mac & Cheese and Baked Brie appetizers come out quickly (remember, hangry). I pride myself on making an amazing Mac & Cheese but this one blew my mind. I don't know what magnificent witchcraft they're performing in that kitchen but I'm HOOKED. 

We received excellent service from Matthew at the bar, and will absolutely be back soon for 10 orders of Mac & Cheese. 
**********************************************
BACK FOR MORE MAC AND CHEESE :) :) :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid place to grab a burger and beer.  The Tavern burger is very good and I enjoyed my Wooky Jack beer out on the patio."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a great review as we know prior management, but after our experience tonight I'm not sure that we'll be back. Server meant well, however service was extremely slow. We started with the Mac n cheese, and it came out cooler than what it should've been and for the price was an extremely small portion. I ordered the turkey wrap and the hubby ordered the 3 little pigs pizza and pork stew. After some wait, he brought out the wrap and pork stew, but said the chef burnt the pizza and it would be out ASAP. I ate one of the wrap rolls and didn't touch the rest. Wasn't the worst thing I've had, but it was lacking flavor. No ranch or cheese on it either as stated on the menu. After coming by 20 minutes after he originally brought the food, he never asked about my full plate or if there was anything else he could get in place of it. At this point, still no pizza. By the time he brought it, we were ready to go and asked for it to be boxed. Side note as well, we came in after 8pm, so it was not busy at all. When he brought the check, there was no comp or anything for the delayed pizza. Again, we really wanted it to work out and hate to be the stereotypical yelpers, but we feel the only way a place will succeed is with honest feedback. I hope Tavern Americana does well in the long run!"}
{"text":"We have had a few very nice meals here. Excellent service. The shaved apple and gorgonzola salad with mixed baby greens, candied walnuts, bleu cheese, red wine vinaigrette is so delicious!  The grilled Niman Ranch steak is was wonderful and so was the Salmon.  We have eaten here a few times and have enjoyed every meal!"}
{"text":"Holly was very nice, knew what to recommend and was very attentive.
The drinks were phenomenal: Maker's Mark Manhattan, The Western Rye to die for.
Try the Chipotle, it's a must. Loved the Yukon Gold Gnocchi and Salmon Filet get 5 stars.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our four year old there last night. It was our first time dining there. We didn't eat super extravagantly but the price was a little extravagant. While they are super kid friendly and have a lot of options for kids' food, my daughter ate for $10.95, which seemed a little high. For a four dollar applejuice, I would have expected for it to be spiked with a little rum or alcohol-- $4 dollars for a kids' drink?!?The food was not terrible but it was not terribly remarkable, either. We ordered pita and hummus as an appetizer. There wasn't anything special about the hummus. The pita, however was super fresh and pillowy. I ordered the tricolored quinoa salad with a piece of salmon on top. The salad and salmon were a little bland. My husband order the 'hold the tomato' white pizza and said it was very good. We were very satisfied with our service. The atmosphere is super pleasant and the waitstaff was awesome. Overall, their menu is limited and small and food is pricey. Will try again but not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Love going to Tavern Americana.  Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great.  Food is great!  Try the pizza, it's awesome."}
{"text":"Great location.  Great food.  Friendly staff.  Fun happy hour.  Pizzas are excellent.  Huge selection of draft beers.   Outside seating comfy and relaxing.  Chopped Chicken salad is spectacular."}
{"text":"This place must be going under or the management just closes up whenever they want, despite posted business hours.  Showed up an hour before they are supposed to close on Sunday and no one is there and the lights are all off .  Nice...."}
{"text":"We made it out to Tavern Americana because we purchased a Groupon for Art Revolution Tonight painting class that actually takes places inside of their location.  We went early just so we could sit and eat here since it was new to us.  Luckily, we made it for happy hour, which runs til 7 p.m. (great news since the art class starts at 6:30 p.m. and you can grab up a drink or two while painting).  

We ordered the Mac & Cheese appetizer off of the happy hour menu which was around $5 and normally is about $8 - decent savings.  It was very good.  We forgot to request the optional bacon in it, so we will give that a go next time!  It was delicious with out it though.

For main course I had the Western Burger and my fiancee had the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Both of the buns were a touch dry - but the meat on both sandwiches was very nicely done.  The coleslaw on the pulled pork was a touch too tart for him, but if you like more tart coleslaw this may be right up your alley.

We could NOT pass up a chance to try the baked cookie skillet with ice cream a la mode.  It was well worth it.  

Overall: A
Grab up an Art Revolution Tonight Groupon with Violet and eat at the Tavern.  Excellent date night!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to stop in here based on the amazing reviews so this past Sunday afternoon, my husband and I finally did. It was probably about 3:30 or so when we arrived and it was quite dead. There were a few people at the bar but not many people dining. 

We both had a bloody mary which was extremely flavorful and the craft beer selection was impressive. They had some different beers on draft that are a tad more uncommon which I appreciate. 

As for the food we both decided on a burger. I got the Green Monster per the waitresses recommendation and my husband got the Tavern Burger.  The burgers came out and they were huge! They also looked very juicy and delicious.  That is where the excitement ended for me though. The burger lacked flavor and did not seem to be seasoned well. Also for the amount of flavors I should have gotten from the poblano chile and chipotle aioli, it was extremely bland. 

I would stop in again... but only for a bloody and a good beer."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and went for beers and appetizers to watch a basketball game.  Ordered chicken nachos which were good.  However, we got there a couple minutes before 5:00 for a 5:00 game.  Asked to have TV by us switched to ESPN2.  Waited 15 minutes before they turned it to ESPN.  My wife went up to bartender who was the only one the waitress said could turn the channel.  He told her he would change it went \"he had time.\"  Waited another 6 minutes until I went up and complained.  They finally changed it with 8 minutes left in first half.  By that time we got our check so we could go watch somewhere else.  We will stick with Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers in our neighborhood instead of here.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not as good as our previous visit last year. You can find better for less elsewhere. I had ribs and they were ok (better at Longhorn) but the finger wipes were pathetic. My wife had the patty melt but again not anything special. The service was good but again nothing special. This is a shame as we really enjoyed our visit last year."}
{"text":"The place was horrible. One side was not open but trash was just piled all over tables. The tables were all in random spots and dirty. We went to sit and the seats were all covered in food. Hostess didn't even offer to clean them. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I am so embarrassed that I suggested we go here for the Mother's Day brunch, which I made reservations for a month in advance. The floors were littered with squashed food and the menus were stained. On the email they sent out advertising the Mother's day brunch it advertised a great selection for that day which they did not actually have on the menu, so I was bummed that the Crab cake Benedict was not a menu item as advertised. There was only  2 other tables occupied when we got there and it was pretty empty. We placed our order and an hour later we still did not receive our meals which were basically sandwiches and I ordered the power bowl.  We asked the waiter why we were still waiting and he said they were so busy, which was not true. Finally 10 minutes after complaining that we waited for over an hour, our meals came out and not at the same time. My power bowl was okay except for the under cooked tater tots in it. My son was served a very pathetic looking $14 patty melt with fries so hard and burnt that they were actually hollow inside.These fries were visibly burnt and looked petrified, someone else in our party had fries and their were normal.I was so angry at this point and asked to speak to a manager but I was told he was in the kitchen. I The portions were small in all our meals. Each meal was $14 and worth no more than $2. I would not recommend to anyone and I wish I didn't have to pay for this junk we were finally served."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff and atmosphere.  Diablo tots and a steak salad were a wonderful afternoon lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with some family. The servers and host were polite. Staff was really attentive and not pushy at all. The place was very quaint,  and comfy. The food came in a timely manner and it was pretty tasty. It was more on the expensive side but it was good. I noticed they have herbs growing outside which I thought was cool. 
 I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries. I loved the havarti and apple slaw on it but the pork itself was dry. They have a decent alcohol selection. I didn't try any desert but I would surely go back again to do so."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, good staff, great location. Kid friendly. Happy Hour starts at 2pm. Green chile pork is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"The service was very slow and upon entering the fairly empty restaurant, the hostess was very unfriendly and made us feel as if there was no space for us to sit. The staff members and the manager yelled at my kids for walking around. Their menu was not creative as they used kraft mac and cheese instead of an original and the food was cold. After all of this madness, a staff member stole our credit card numbers as we had fraudulent activity immediately after we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the first time and tried the Three Pigs pizza.  It looked very good when we received it, lots of toppings.  Unfortunately as soon as we bit into it we were extremely disappointed. It was very, very greasy. Not what a pizza should be. It seems like they do not have a clue how to make or cook pizza at this restaurant or they need a new pizza cook.  I don't think we will return.  There are other places that know how to make pizza.  Tailgaters is one example (Tatum Blvd.)"}
{"text":"The previous reviews of this restaurant were mixed so it was a nice surprise we found it quite nice.  The menu is basic but very good.  The wait staff  friendly and accommodating and the price is right.  We were there early on a Sunday evening so it wasn't very crowded.  If you sit near the outdoor patio they have heaters that are turned on after sunset.  The only thing I would mention is -- they have a number of television sets scattered throughout so it gives a \"sport bar\" look at first sight.  If there was a big game and lots of people I'm sure the atmosphere would have been quite different.  It was not this way the night we went -- we could actually hear each other talk !!! :-)"}
{"text":"Good restaurant, tables a bit close together, but cool layout and good food."}
{"text":"Ordered the green chile pork on recommendation from server, Matthew. Holy cow, the pig was delicious! Melt in your mouth pieces with a soft tortilla. 
Split it with my husband as a prelude to later dinner when we will return with friends. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times couldn't get anyone to take our order.  Talked to the manager and didn't seem too interested in our problem so we left.  Will not be going back, just outright rude there."}
{"text":"Had the roasted chicken. It was juicy, and the whole plate, spinach, onions, and polenta(don't even know what that is but fantastic). 
Some items from tks. Which I love. Not too loud, good lighting. I need to see my food. Timing was FAST.  In at 6:58, food out by 7:05. Not kidding. Def coming back."}
{"text":"Solid food and service. I like that they use all locally grown products.

We came on a weekday and it wasn't that busy at all. I assume it gets way more hectic at night. The outdoor seating was pleasant. My only complaint is that the food took awhile to come out, but the quality was good."}
{"text":"About as advertised. Great beer list. Mediocre food. Mediocre service. Open and noisy like .... A tavern. Go figure. Decent selection of TVs to watch the games. 

If you and some buddies wanna grab a beer or two then this is a great choice. For lunch maybe okay too. Dinner....meh."}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3.5 Stars
In short, the food was good but compared to other restaurants in the area, it could be better.

I came here on a business lunch with co-workers. When we arrived, there were only one or two other tables with customers and the place seemed pretty dead. Not sure if it was because we were here around 11:30am and the lunch rush hadn't picked up or what. This worked in our favor since our waiter was very attentive and the service was fast and efficient. 

I liked the inside as it was very open and had plenty of seating. There was a lot of wood, which looked nice. It reminded me of an upscale tavern, which is what I was expecting. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated and had ample room in the stalls.

For lunch, my boss ordered the Diablo Chicken Pasta, which had a very spicy and creamy sauce with chicken and bacon. He said it was very good and it looked delicious. Another co-worker ordered a Green Monster burger and I ordered the Western burger. I normally enjoy a medium-rare burger, but since I've never ordered a burger from this place previously and had no idea how they cook their burgers, I went with medium.  My co-worker risked it and went medium-rare. When our burgers arrived, both were cooked about the same. (Mainly medium, leaning a little towards medium-rare. The burger itself was flavorful and the fries were pretty good.

By the time we finished our meal, only one other table filled up and this was an elderly couple. It was crazy to see a place so dead during a weekday at lunchtime. 

Overall, while the food was good, I don't know if I'd come back. I say this only because it is located in a shopping plaza with several other restaurants that I really love. Thus, if I was in the area, I would choose those restaurants first. However, their happy hour does look pretty good and I might give it another chance."}
{"text":"Ask & ye shall receive! I gave the bartender Matt ordering privileges for my dinner & he delivered with a the Diablo Chicken Pasta - make sure to get it with an agua back compadres - this one is ¡muy caliente"}
{"text":"Love the food especially there wings,  love the service and atmosphere, in a great location look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Food = Phenomenal.
Ambiance = Needs improvement.
Service = Very friendly, but slow and disorganized. 

Tavern Americana has a nice space, but it needs to be utilized much better.   There's a nice open wine room that is pleasing to the eye, but other than that and a couple of TV's, there's nothing to look at.  The walls are grey and plain.  A few photos or paintings would do a lot for the atmosphere. The acoustics are also awful.  It is loud in there.  The restaurant was packed, and hostess was trying to tell us that we could wait in a small \"lounge\" area, and order a drink, but I could only catch every couple words she said.  I know I'm getting older, but at 33 I shouldn't be freaking out that my hearing is starting to go.

Service was slow, and it was obivious the servers and runners were a little over whelmed.  We didn't have any major problems, but a couple of the tables around us were brought either the wrong food, or the runner couldn't tell which person ordered something sans a topping, etc.

The food is great.  It's a tad pricier than it feels like it should be, but the ingredients are all fresh, which makes the price very forgivable.  We had the roasted chicken pizza and a tavern burger.  The pizza was good, but a touch oily.  The burger was also good, but it felt like it could have used something to make it special.  The fries are awesome and served with a house spicy ketchup.

The good news for Tavern Americana is that the flaws of the place are all fixable.  Put some art on the walls, figure out a way to quiet down the background noise, and get a better system for running food.  Definitely would go back."}

{"text":"First time I went to this place we enjoyed the food and the servers were very friendly,  went back a second time ordered the pizza and Yuk!   Greasy soggy crust and tasted horrible,  servers were friendly and fast.  I guess you have to just have a couple favorites here because not everything is good. Not sure we will go back again."}
{"text":"It is not the menu or the food, but the service that may be downfall at this new neighborhood place.  We sat at the bar (which is usual for us) and the bartenders were more interested in chating with friends than to make sure we were happy with our meal.
We were going to order dessert but as soon as the plates were taken, the bartender presented us with the tab.  Too bad, we walked over to Local Bistro and had dessert there.  May come back but with some many other good places that have opened up lately (Soul Cafe, Isabella's, etc.), it might be a while before we return."}
{"text":"Pretty excellent burgers and decent beer on tap. Nice place...upscale but still casual. Great lunch spot."}

{"text":"I loved it the first time. That review is below but I will never return. Went there on a Saturday afternoon, 2 pm, four top for linner. It reeked of perfume which was soon revealed to be a failed attempt to cover a sewer smell INSIDE the restaurant. We moved to the open air patio where it was tolerable. Being a vegetarian I ordered off the menu because they do not have any veggie entrees or sandwiches. I created a sandwich from all the other sandwich options. They charged me for a club and added $1 charge for avocado. Lame, because my club was two stories with arugula, havarti, sundried tomatoes, & pesto. Their club is three stories with meat etc. My husbands pulled pork sandwich had no bbq sauce. It was BLAND. The server Anthony was attentive and friendly but as we left he was sitting at a table with several other workers, it was the only other table occupied. The placed smelled dirty, tables could have been bussed. The hostess was bored and possibly mute, I don't think she spoke. This place won't last. Too bad, I loved it the first time. 

Bravo! Delightful joint. Service was spot on. Food was generous and delicious. Vibe was just what a Saturday afternoon calls for, relaxed, spacious, clean, comfortable. We met two friends of ours there. Sat in the bar. Ordered hummus and nachos. The cilantro sauce on the nachos was unique and tasty! I didn't try the hummus but there was a lot of it, which is nice. The beer was cold and fresh. Arugula beet salad was yummy. Lots of beets!  Hubby had a burger, he said it was very good. The service, again, was spot on. The girl was genuine, friendly, knowledgeable and conscientious. I don't recall her name but she's a vegan. Also, happy hour prices or not this place is affordable, and serves high quality food."}
{"text":"I ordered 45 min before.  Mushroom pizza. It was prepared on time. However it was barely cooked. I expect a bit of char. On a brick oven fired pizza.   Was at work so did not have time to ask for my za to prepared correctly. Was originally told 45 min. Then told 20m. I will no longer dream of Tavern Americana pizzas"}
{"text":"I love this place! 
High quality food. Great atmosphere. 
Tavern Americana's pulled pork sandwich is amazing and their salads are perfect.  My favorite is the apple and gorgonzola.  Kid's eat free on Tuesday nights too which makes it a great place for family.  I lunch here with clients and vendors because it's quiet enough to talk and there is wifi.  There is a private room that is perfect for board meetings. 
Management is very attentive and the wait staff rocks.  
Try their skinny mojito as well!"}
{"text":"There are so many different things that can make a restaurant special. Sometimes it's the food, sometimes it's the service, still other times, it's the ambiance.

In this case, while it's true the food was wonderful, swiftly delivered and the wooden tables and comfortable benches were welcoming, the best part was the horrific date that unfolded in front of us.

If you want more detail on the food, it's sprinkled throughout the review.

Ok, so this really pretty girl came in, dressed to the nines -- hair, makeup, shoes, dress, all perfect. Her \"date\" was older than she, wearing a wrinkled t-shirt, a baseball cap, and jeans.

No big, hey, fashion, etc., who am I to judge?

Well, he went directly to his phone and started doing something, we couldn't tell what, but he utterly ignored the girl in front of him. She waited politely, didn't pull out her phone, but just sat there expectantly, figuring (at least I think) that he'd be done soon. He wasn't and our appetizers arrived. 

The calimari / zucchini was awesome and flaky with zesty sauce. Definitely worth it.

We started eating and noticed that the girl had moved around from the far side of the table so that she could join him in whatever he was doing.

At this point, he called someone, grabbed his hat, and left. She moved back over to her side of the table, waited about 5 minutes while I enjoyed the taco sampler (the fish taco was amazing, the other ones tasty but so spicy my wussy self couldn't finish them), then pulled out her phone.

She briefly tapped at it, then put it away.

Their appetizers arrived, and she looked around to see where her date had gone, but he was nowhere to be seen. After waiting another 5 minutes, she started to pick at them until she was eating in earnest. Apparently the wings were really good.

Our entrees arrived and my pastrami sandwich was wonderful. My 8-year-old daughter got the chicken strips and said they were UH-MAY-ZING so I guess they were pretty good too.

We ordered the cookie with ice cream and that's when the couple's entrees arrived.

This poor girl sat alone at a table with four large platters of food, no date in sight, glancing around every 10 seconds, just wanting someone to save her.

My daughter and I finished the cookie which was also UH-MAY-ZING (seriously, best I've had -- chocolate chip in a skillet) and asked for the check.

Still no guy.

Paid the check.

Still no guy.

Left. 

Still no guy.

For all I know, she's there still, waiting on some guy to come back to the table to eat cold food and receive an even colder gaze.

I decided to use the whole thing as an object lesson and asked my daughter what she would have done.

She  said she would have left, because he clearly didn't like that girl enough.

I told her that she was close -- first, eat, then leave.

Because the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Tavern Americana delivers what it promises nearly flawlessly.  To start with, Tavern Americana is exactly as the name implies - a tavern-like setting serving American tavern-like food.  There is a bar and a bar eating area with high-top tables, and an adjacent standard dining area with booths and tables.  Both are noisy, but not so bad that you can't have a conversation.  Everything is new and perfectly clean.  The service is prompt, friendly, and attentive to just the right degree.  The prices are surprisingly moderate.

And the food is spot on - at least what we tasted, which included a flavorful pizza, a salad, and a burger (good, but the least successful of the lot due to under-seasoning).

But it is the \"little\" things which differentiate Tavern Americana from the crowd.  For example, the beer was properly chilled and poured correctly (just the right head).  For example, when we ordered a half salad and split that, they brought it in two bowls with a separate dressing cup for each.  And, I didn't have to ask for ketchup (home-made I believe).

Hint: We went on a Wednesday evening and it was full but not overflowing.  Reservations are a good idea any day of the week."}
{"text":"Tavern Americana is proof you can't get by on interior design alone. Everything we ordered was cold which included appetizers, burgers and fries. The restaurant was not busy which makes you wonder if the food is prepared beforehand and warmed up before it is served. Underwhelming to say the least."}
{"text":"Bar area is quite fun and more vibrant than some of the other stuffy places in north scottsdale where old people just drink wine and smell their wine glasses. I would recommend if you're looking for something a little more fun."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place after finding the doors at The Grind locked....what a fantastic surprise. Organic and local ingredients, a great craft beer selection and an owner/chef who was a delight to chat with. We just moved to the neighborhood and having a place like this with some healthy options is a huge plus for us!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant, and it didn't disappoint. This used to be the old Irish pub style bar, this place feels anything but old now. The decor feels modern but warm and very open and airy. The wine selection was very well priced and had a great selection. I had the Pinot Gris ($ 6.00 a glass) nice! There was three of us in our party each had a different dish, I had the pulled pork, they had the steak w/risotto and tenderloin. We all cleaned our plates enough said. They do not have a happy hour \"yet\" we were told. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Can't wait to try this place again.  Love, love!"}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful in house made Pasta Bolognese with Lemon Ricotta.
As Chef Ian explained: it's the Lemon Ricotta that's the secret to enjoyment, without that filling feeling. 
Can't wait for next week's Specials. 
Thanks Tim for thinking outside the box and expanding your offerings."}
{"text":"I've only tried this place once, but can't wait to go back and try more of the local favorite menu items. I hear the happy hour is great."}
{"text":"The pulled port sandwich and green chili stew are are great along with the excellent bar staff give this five stars  -  one for the drab space.
Great draft beer selection!"}
{"text":"On the positive side, the place has nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.  On the negative side, the food just isn't that good and our service was a bit slow.  We tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was a bunch of bun and a small piece of chicken.  Two different burgers were tried with the sides mixed up on each.  Last was a wood fired pizza which came out 15 minutes after everything else.  It was evidently the pizza guys first night, and it showed.  The pizza was soggy in the middle and not what a wood fired pizza should be.  I would love to say I would try again, but when 4 out of 4 entrees are average to not good, it is hard to recommend."}
{"text":"$8 beers are you kidding me? NO WAY. will never return. Ambiance,  food , staff fair at best."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Claire waited on us, wow!!! What attention she gave. Constantly taking care of our needs. Good prices. An excellent place with a good owner who offers good conversation & enjoyable libations. Would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and enjoyed the outdoor seating. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered off the happy hour menu and it was good. Nothing exceptional but the atmosphere and the outdoor seating made it"}
{"text":"Very good food at this restaurant, but the lunchtime service needs some work. We went here for lunch on a Thursday around noon and there were only two servers working. Although the restaurant was generally quiet at this time, it took a moment to get seated because the host was running around like he was busy. Once we got seated we had our servers attention until the lunch rush happened; at which point we had to wait 20 minutes between the time we finished our lunch, to the time we actually got up to find him and pay our bill. I think the restraint just needs some more time to figure out staffing for the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood tavern serving burgers and pub grub.  Recently had the ribs.  They were good.  They have a lot of TVs and a good bar.  Normal kids menu.  Family friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, good selection of beer on draft...  Downside....  Prices are too high.  Happy hour prices are not happy!  Game day Sunday and the bar is empty...  Should be packed.  If the prices were reasonable, it would be.  Volume people, volume."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a week and came here twice!  We enjoyed the setting, the wait staff was attentive, and the oven baked pizza the best!  We also had a salad with roasted beets..yum!"}
{"text":"I have ate here a few times now and think this place is great. Lots of beer on tap and an excellent green chile dish. The staff is really responsive and friendly in both the dining and bar area. Great place to meet up for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Solid food and service. Both owners have extensive food and beverage experience  and it shows in their menu and service. There are plenty of TV's to watch your favourite game. Had the three little pigs and chicken pesto pizza from the wood fired oven and they were delicious. I highly recommend this place to get out of the house."}
{"text":"Went here as a group and we all had a good time.  They had live music which was a plus.  Wife had the NY steak which she said was great and I tried the Green Monster off of a recommendation and thought it was good but not stellar. The rest of the group also seemed pleased with their choices. Overall, food and service was good and we'll be back to check out more."}
{"text":"We live nearby and eat here on a regular basis. The green chili pork appetizer is delicious and I love the steak salad. Good value for quality and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner, my mom lives up the street and my hubby and I are in town from Orange County visiting her for Easter. We have eaten here 3 times before and always had awesome meals and service. Last night was subpar, our food came out over cooked and cold not once, but twice even after we sent it back with the first cold & over cooked complaint. It was such a bummer! By the time we got the 2nd round of cold, over cooked burgers we were so hungry from driving 6 hours we ate it despite it not being warm and delicious. The food runner was not helpful and seemed like he was in a bad mood. Our waitress was nice and friendly, but was maybe too busy to get our hot burgers out to us on time or check on us regularly to get us more drinks or make sure our food came out right? Not sure, but It was less than stellar and we were bummed. At least she took a few bucks off our bill which was the least they could have done considering. Maybe they were short staffed or too busy b/c of Easter weekend? Either way they need to step it up busy or not! We were huge fans, hopefully they redeem themselves for next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on a Friday night. The place is extremely loud. Happy hour selection is good. The pizza was good. Overall the place was just ok."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, fantastic menu and wine/beer/cocktail selection.  We had the Pumpkin Soup (superb) and salmon salad and pizza with the apple fritters for dessert.  So jazzed to have a great American rest in the area.  Shocking how poorly run the service staff were.....they were indifferent, borderline snotty and inefficient. Had to ask for utensils, salt and pepper, water, drinks etc.  We asked for parm cheese for the pizza and the waitress actually brought us an empty cheese clear shaker.  We ate dinner at 8pm and even though the rest was half full, the young wait staff were breaking down everything for the night.  When we left we literally had to walk past the chef, manager and lead waitstaff having a meeting at the exit area and no one said goodbye, thank you, hope you enjoyed your meal etc.  I had to say thank you to them and they looked annoyed to be interrupted.  To make it in this town you have to have more than great food and atmosphere........Service, Service, Service ( and I am not talking fawning/fake/over attentive service.....I am talking decent hello, thank you and caring about the customer vs hiring young and beautiful people type service.)"}
{"text":"Happy to see this addition to neighborhood. We started with pork green chili appetizer. Very good!  Noted as a house favorite and I see why. Pastrami sandwich is another favorite and it was excellent. Not huge as many are. Just excellent.  Mushroom pizza had way too many mushrooms on It. Good pizza.  Would pick a different flavor. Overbearing.   Good selection of wine by glass.  But I think I got one opened one too many days. Unfortunately too many restaurants do this. Especially when manager of it is not a wine drinker. Still overall happy for this addition to neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and found the food to be average nothing spectacular especially to go there again. We had asked our waitress about the price of one of their beers posted on the blackboard in the bar (no prices were posted) and she told us this particular beer was on happy hour pricing but she failed to let us know of anything else that was on happy hour. My husband the chicken wings and he said they were tasty and I ordered the pastrami which was lean but very dry and just okay and not something I'd order again. Their homemade potato chips didn't even seem like they were homemade. They have a decent amount of craft beers but they didn't have as big of a selection as we thought they would. They didn't have a stout so I had ordered the only porter they had instead which was good. It seemed as if they mostly had ales. No reason for us to return."}
{"text":"Lure in the premium craft beer drinkers with a good list but then shove them away when those beers are excluded on the happy hour.  In all honesty they might as well just not have a HH if they're going to make it so obvious that they just want the full price folks.  They have a great list of craft beers, but only Coors light and Coors' Blue Moon are beers listed on the happy hour.  And then for spirits, it's the low quality options like Cuervo Gold, JW Red, etc. that are discounted.  Yes this is a high rent area with a wealthy local customer base, so why not just omit the happy hour altogether?  Alternatives for happy hour just head over to City North or Desert Ridge and get those same beers on HH because this place doesn't want (need?) your business.

More generally, they've vastly improved the atmosphere over the Irish bar that went out of business in the same location.  It has a more upscale feel, good presentation of food, and our service was very good on this occasion.  Nothing to rave about with the food, nor necessarily critique either.  Food pricing is within normal range for the area.  Parking is good due to the shared strip mall & grocery store parking."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour!  Above the norm typical happy hour bar food:    The green chili pork was amazing - so tender with just the right amount of spice!   We also ordered a delish vegetarian pizza with roasted corn, mushrooms, red peppers, and more.   Typically happy hour pizza's are small and just barely enough for one person, but this pizza was huge - actually took it home and had it for lunch the next day.   The serving sizes are really generous - especially for happy hour - such a rarity!   

Service was great - server was personable and quick.    The dining room is loud....extremely loud.  They have hardwood floors and open ceilings, so nothing to absorb the sound.  Thinking once summer is over and they open the patio doors it will be at a more acceptable level.  So keep in mind if you don't want to shout across the table!

Can't wait to come back and try the gnocchi - which I hear is amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here mainly to attend the Art Revolution day class on Saturday.  The class was FANTASTIC!!!  We stayed to have lunch afterwards and what a wonderful surprise.  I had the pork chili and asked for tortilla chips instead of the flour tortilla it normally comes with.  Little did I know, they make their own tortilla chips (just like my mom used to).  Even some of the best Mexican restaurants don't do that!  It was a real treat!!!  The chili was also fantastic and so was my daughter's mac & cheese.  Staff is super friendly and made me wine spritzers exactly the way I wanted them, with the wine chosen from the wine list.  A big pet peeve of mine is stale lemons or limes in my drink.  But, nope, I could tell that lemon in my wine spritzer was freshly cut, seeds removed, and exactly how I like it.  I'm the type of person who would never complain if it wasn't exactly right so it was such a pleasure to get it exactly how I like without any pretention that I want it that way.  Would go back in a heartbeat!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for Mother's Day and what a disaster. It took 50 minutes to serve us with what I call fast food. I had the roasted beef salad and it was good except for the chicken I had added. The chicken was day old and tough not moist and fresh. One person with us had an egg whites dish that came from the kitchen burnt. Service wasn't much better. The waitress came early and got us our initial drinks and then we didn't see her for 30 minutes. She came to our table filled our water glasses and spilled some water on the table and just walked away without the intention of cleaning up the spilled water. Had to summon her back. I have never had a worst experience and will never come back."}
{"text":"Went out for happy hour with some friends. Was really pretty dead for a Thursday night. Ordered some Margherita pizza.  The pizza was just okay but my friends had some chicken and quinoa and they said it was very good. Champagne? Check. Good glass of wine ? Check. Close to home. Check. It was good. Not 5 star but I would go back."}
