{"text":"Hot dayum this joint is my new jam!

As I type up this review, I'm shoveling in last nights leftovers. 

So BK is pretty much a hole in the wall. But to me that usually translates to AWESOME. I can't say much more than the previous good reviews have thrown down. 

I'll say this: the oxtail, curry chicken and jerk chicken were all delicious. My favorite was the rice and beans.

I'm sad that I only just found Bratenahl Kitchen last night. I'll be a regular now. The owner was seriously nice, too. 

Also, don't plan to dine in. Take that shizz out!"}
{"text":"Bratenahl Kitchen is pretty much just that - a kitchen, behind a bulletproof window, with a table inside and a covered patio outside. Food - amazing. Vibe - shady as f***. What it lacks in hipster appeal, it makes up for with plenty of personality and flavor. 

I drove up to one of the handful of parking spots located right off the road and had to double check that the \"OPEN\" sign was lit because it didn't look like anyone was inside the tiny shack, or the decrepit, tinier shack next door. Luckily, the door was unlocked and bells jingled to alert the proprietor/cook of my presence. The menu is succinct, but it was hard not to be distracted by the graffiti covering every surface (even the ceiling), all heartily endorsing the authenticity and tastiness of the food. A good sign. All the items are competitively priced too since the menu price includes tax. (But definitely include tip if you're happy with your meal.) Going with my gut, I projected at the ear behind the plastic that I wanted Shrimp Sautee. He nodded and disappeared into the domain of his kitchen. 

The place has a smell like spoiled vegetables and unwashed rags, which wasn't the most pleasant to wait in, but I hoped the graffiti wasn't wrong. One of the four chairs around the lone table was my temporary perch. An unseen radio was broadcasting some Winter Olympics event, so at least I didn't have to wait in silence. You may also choose to amuse yourself by reading the various signage, including the answer to the question, \"Is there a public bathroom?\" on the door to the kitchen (No) and \"Am I safe here?\" (Yes, potential goonies beware of the owner), and a myriad of religious fixtures. 

In short order my shrimp came, smelling a hundred times more fragrant than the rest of the dining area. He showed me my order in a takeout box through the window, an exchange of cash was made, and I collected my goods. All the utensils are disposable, so I guess a lot of labor is saved by not having to wash anything but the cookware. 

Now, the food - DELICIOUS. Like, currently salivating while thinking about it delicious. The shrimp were fluffy and covered in a rich, sweet, and smoky sauce. Fresh black peppercorns added a kick to the meal, and even the rice and beans I couldn't shovel into my mouth fast enough. These portions will definitely keep the munchies away for a few hours. 

I will be returning to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place deserves Zero stars I ordered curry shrimp the rice was hard and stuck together cabbage bitter just all wrong. I call the place talk to the guy Ricky who runs it I guess and he super rude wouldn't listen told me he not giving me my money back and if one bite is missing he 's not giving another order out. Whatever u do never eat here"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience when I come here. It is a little spot but the food is good and fresh. The owner Rich is always friendly and full of life. I never have to wait a long time for my food.  I usually order the Curry shrimp which is always good and made to order. The curry is a little spicy which is perfect for me.  This past weekend I ordered the oxtails and they were BOMB! The oxtails were so tender and flavorful. And he gave a generous portion. (usually places are really stingy with oxtails)  I can honestly say this is one of the best Jamaican spots I have had in the Cleveland.  area."}
{"text":"I had never tried Jamaican food but my daughter came home from college and we went there.. a little scary it wasn't my kind of place but I go along being the cool mom. Oh my god this food was so Good.. AWESOME!! I had jerk chicken she had ox tails if I learned one thing from my daughter is never judge a book by its cover.. I will be back to try something else"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place. This is the epitome of a hole in the wall, but the guy running the place is super nice and friendly. Credit card machine wasn't working and he told me where the closest ATM was. It had a $1 fee and he gave me a $1 discount off my food without even asking!

There's only one table on the inside. Probably take your food to go if it's cold outside. There's a patio with a decent amount of seating in front of the restaurant. The menu has quite a few options, check out my photos of it. Judging by the tape over the menu, It seems like it changes quite a bit or some items are seasonal (there was a grill on the outside, maybe some taped off items involved that?). I didn't try it but they had sweet potato pie if you have a sweet tooth (wasn't on the main menu). They also had a few Jamaican sodas. The menu has a good variety of dishes and some you won't find anywhere else.

From what I've gathered, the food is authentic Jamaican home style cooking. It was delicious, but make sure you're ready for those bones! I got a \"small\" goat curry and a large braised oxtails to share with my wife. I love goat in general and the goat curry was great. It wasn't as strong as Indian curry, but it was still very flavorful. The braised oxtails were excellent as well. Both were served with a side of cabbage, rice, and beans. I don't know how to explain the cabbage, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"As soon as I opened the door and smelled what was happening I knew I was in the right place.

First time having a beef patty, SO delicious! The curry patty is also wonderful, but I found myself less willing to share the beef with my boyfriend. Plantains are great, the side was a pretty good portion for $3. Really enjoyed the jerk chicken, falls off the bone! I did expect it to be a little spicier but I hardly minded, it was so yummy. I think the cabbage that comes with the meat might honestly just be cabbage and celery cooked in fat but somehow is also amazing.

The gentleman cooking seemed really nice! I can't wait to go back. It is a good sign when the restaurant is covered floor to ceiling with graffiti raving about the food."}
{"text":"I had driven by a number of times on the motorcycle and always wondered if this was worth a shot; well after reading the reviews, thought I would stop after work on Saturday.  Wow was this worth the trip.

This is almost literally a hole in the wall, just a little storefront with the kitchen behind plexiglass for security and a single table inside, although there are a couple of tables outside.  The chef is the only one there, he takes your order and cooks your food.  You don't want to go here if you are looking for atmosphere; but if you want great food this is the place.

Ordered the shrimp saute, since they had no fish left.  For $12 I got a large portion on nice sized tail on shrimp with some red peppers over the rice and beans with a side of cabbage and veggies.  The food was delicious, not overly spicy, but nicely seasoned and very rich.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce.  I will be back again.

While they are willing to take credit cards, he is doing this on a smartphone and the system doesn't work very well, so I ended up paying cash.

Overall this is the kind of place that is out of the way, but has sensational food.  Go and check it out.  They are open 7 days a week from lunch through dinner, with 1pm to 7pm hours on Sunday."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and hot. I recommend this place to anyone. Please don't be fooled by the small unique building, try it and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This place looks like it is closed all the time, it's not; Just stop in and get a great dish made right in front of you. The guy was very friendly and patient. I wasn't sure what I wanted, he let me sample some of the prepared food. Great place when you want some island food"}
{"text":"Loved it! I had the chicken brown stew and a beef pattie. Place isn't exactly the ambiance palace, but the food is worth the stop. This place should bump enough to afford a better location. I want to partner up and make this happen. If I only had restaurant capital and a dream. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is the second Jamaican place in Cleveland that I've encountered with a bulletproof window that I had to order through. Hmm...is this the norm?

It's pretty run down looking - but that's never deterred me from great food before. I ordered the small size of curry chicken and jerk chicken. They come with rice and cabbage. The serving size is HUGE! Food was good but not memorable imo. I've ordered the same things from Ocho Rios and the curry had more sauce and flavor and the jerk chicken had more of a kick. 

Another thing - they do NOT accept the restaurant.com certificate and even though they show signs that they accept credit cards, it's always conveniently \"not working.\" So I would consider this a cash only place. I'd prefer it if they straight up just say that rather than do the CC machine isn't working bs though."}
{"text":"curry goat was terrible gave me heartburn and the flavor was off never going back"}
{"text":"Don't be scared by the appearance or location, or you'll miss some SERIOUSLY GOOD FOOD!! Everything I have tried has made my mouth do a happy happy tongue dance. Ox tail, goat, jerk chicken, all are worth trying because you will love it! And those patties... DROOOOOOOOOL.

My family first discovered the place while house hunting and immediately decided this food would be perfect for catering an upcoming party. The owner was so cooperative, generous, and creative to work with. He so kindly thew in some special coleslaw and extra patties with the large order, which was also mouth watering. Overall, wonderful and consistent service, food, and experience. Cannot stress enough that you should give this place all your money."}
{"text":"Really good Jamaican home cooking here. 

Location is quite obscure. You are likely not ever going to be 'just driving by' this place. But if you are anywhere near University Circle/Cleveland Heights, I highly recommend you take a 20 minute detour to find this little treat. 

We got jerk chicken, cabbage and red beans and rice - classic and very well done. Chicken was falling off the bones as it always should be in this food genre. Very well spiced - yummy. Sides were equally good. There are good options for Jamaican beverages as well for you to try. 

Expect to get takeout. There really is not seating to speak of and what there is consists of white plastic deck furniture which was pretty dirty and sketchy looking. But don't worry, you'll get a giant take-out container of yummy goodness to take with you. Head over to MLK and sit at one of the gardens or to Case campus to lunch with a friend as I did. 

Only downsides are the somewhat sketchiness - no eat in option and also they didn't have plantains the day I went - bummer because that's one of my favorite things to get when eating Jamaican. 

Overall definitely worth the detour into Bratenahl. Will definitely stop here again sometime."}
{"text":"Delicious food but ran into the same issue as others with \"the credit card machine is broken\"' routine. Curried shrimp was excellent!! My
Husband said the oxtails were excellent and we both enjoyed the beef patties!!
Close to home so we will go often and take cash if the machine is \"broken\" again!!"}
{"text":"This small, hole in the wall location has the Best Jamaican food I've had in Cleveland. Be prepared to carry out or sit in the outdoor patio, and bring cash. This is a charming, no fuss gem providing great food by a delightful owner/chef.

The portions are generous even for the small size and become 2 meals for me. I've had the ox tail, jerk chicken, curry chicken and curry goat; all were so delicious! Chicken curry patties and beef patties are perfect. You can not chose poorly here!

I also have used their catering and was overjoyed with the results. Amazing Food for 50 people at an amazing price. Please stop in to make an order for catering! The owner is a very generous, kind, and trustworthy person who simply wrote down my order, took a deposit of half, and had the food ready by the time I wanted to pick up."}
