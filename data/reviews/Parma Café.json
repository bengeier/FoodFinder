{"text":"Amazing spot to eat and study.. they have a great lunch/ dinner menu full of panini's, salads and cold pizza... everything I have tried has been fresh and delicious. The espresso beverages are made with great care and taste 10/10. The staff is always friendly and welcoming too-- check this place out. I recommend the chicken cutlet panini!"}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise ! I had no idea this place even existed until tonight, it was one of the best pizzas I ever had.

Picture side walk pizza but 10 times fluffier and way juicier! The margarita pizza was awesome, it comes pre sliced in squares and each slice has a piece of bocconcini on it. The tomato sauce they use has to be made there because it's so juicy and sweet that I refuse to believe it's store bought. The bread is very fluffy and is made just right. Meat balls were good as well I'm pretty sure it was made with veal. They gave a few slices of bread also for the meatballs, I was to stuffed to test it but it did look home made as well.

Only thing I would recommend is adding spices on top but other then that I would recommend to try it with friends because it's a thick yummy pie  :)"}
{"text":"Je ne peut pas vraiment donner mon opinion autre que sur leur \" cold coffee \" mais par contre j'ai aucun doute que le restant de leur menu est décadent!

À la première gorgée de mon café glacé, j'ai instantanément été surprise par le goût et la qualité! Je l'ai demandé un peu sucré avec du lait de soya, et c'était magique. J'y retournerais sans hésiter car le staff était accueillant et chaleureux puis en plein jeudi soir de semaine, il n'y avait pas trop de gens donc c'était agréable d'y être sans la fameuse cacophonie des petits cafés souvent trop remplis! 

Considérant le fait qu'il est plutôt situé proche de Guy Concordia, c'est un must pour ceux qui vont à l'école ou travaillent tout près!"}
{"text":"Went with their \"charcuterie\" panini and arancini balls. I enjoyed both! The panini bread was fresh and fluffy and the cold cuts were tasty. I really liked the arancini balls as well all was washed it down with Brio.

Parma cafe is big and spacious and you can study here. With the nearby universities I can see this being a popular hangout space!

Service was nice and quick and overall it was a very positive experience. 

Minus one star however for not having any protection from the elements. Sitting anywhere near the doors in winter was an issue for us with the amount of times it opened and closed. I truly recommend administration to install either a secondary door to prevent the cold elements bother their patrons or at the very least some thick curtains.

Another note is that I found pricing either really good such as the 3 small arancini balls for $3 or not so much with the $10 panini with no side option. That puts it a bit on the expensive side. Also the cappuccino is $3.50 which puts it a bit on the expensive side as well considering it's $2.50 or $3 in most parts of little Italy. I guess rent is high in this pretty location.

Overall, I'd come back. I want to check out their chicken cutlet panini and try other stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"I love the customer service, the staff is friendly and the food! It's definitely one of my favorite places and convenient for school. Everything's a reasonable price and the menu is a new surprise everyday!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stopping by this nice Italian cafe for a great lunch. A nice open area with a lot of seating at the bar and a few tables in the cafe. They have a wide variety of Italian goods from pizza, panini and also pasta.

So we took 2 chicken cutlet sandwiches with lettuce and hot peppers, a side of French fries with a fantastic truffle mayo.... and I'm saying this was FANTASTIC! And also an order of rice balls also very good! 

I'm glad they opened up an authentic Italian cafe in the heart of downtown. It was about time! I will definitely be back for a nice cappuccino and maybe some Nutella horns... hmmmm!!'"}
{"text":"This café is on Bishop, but it has more a fast-food restaurant vibe because of the big counter of sandwich and pizza inside the café. The noise level is quite high even starting at 10AM in the morning and the tables are quite small. The price is okay but the meal options are not very attractive. I have the impression that most choices are vegetarian and the portion is not big. I don't recommend this café for people who want to study because there are so many distractions, but as a place to meet up friends it is a good spot."}
{"text":"Le biscuit.

LE

BISCUIT!

Ceci sera loin d'être mon avis le plus étoffé, mais il n'en demeure pas moins pertinent!

Je prendrais le métro ou l'autobus sans autre destination que ce biscuit. Peut-être que je capote, mais l'alliance du Nutella, des morceaux de chocolat (pas des vulgaires pépites) et du biscuit sablé juste-un-peu-salé-et-pas-trop-sec est super satisfaisant. Est-ce que je vous ai dit qu'il était immense aussi? Ouais. 

Ces temps-ci, les édifices voisins du café subissent de gros travaux, alors la rue Bishop est un peu triste à regarder. Profitez-en donc pour aller encourager ce commerce et dynamiser la rue :)"}
{"text":"office catered from them.  had leftovers the day after and it was excellent !! recommended"}
