{"text":"Freshly made chicken chawerma (shawerma) - freshly made bread and sauces. Slightly more expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"I agree. I just got the burger which i really liked and it is not completely cooked. Cant bother to return it. But probably wont come back."}
{"text":"shawarma plate: lots of lettuce, no condiments at all."}
{"text":"When they first opened, they were wonderful. It used to be a great price for a huge portion and great quality. I just ordered a chicken kabob sandwhich that came to over $8 with tax. There was minimal lettuce and veggies and the chicken was hard and not fresh. Seems it has gone downhill"}
{"text":"I work at SickKids too and when they first opened the food was fresh and I really enjoyed the variety in toppings -I used to go almost every day. Unfortunately, the quality has gone downhill and I find myself going less and less..it's just not what it used to be- the past 3 times I went the my chicken shawarma sandwich was a bit 'off.' and smelled strangely or the order was incorrect and I had to get it re-made."}
{"text":"Had to update my review, I agree with the other poster quality of the food has gone downhill rapidly which is shocking. The size of the wraps have become tiny less meat and more lettuce. The meat is always cold and greasy lately as well. I have given this place chance after chance but sadly i am done.   The previous head chef which is no longer working there was excellent but has since been replaced. Bluefig owners if you read these reviews get him back and pay him what he wants."}
