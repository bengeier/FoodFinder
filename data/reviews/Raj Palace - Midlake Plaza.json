{"text":"Have you tried Authentic South Indian Cuisine?  Not sure?  It's difficult to find South Indian in Calgary but Raj Palace has just opened its third location and will soon open a fourth.  We tried the recently opened Midlake Plaza restaurant.  It is small with a banquette that wraps around the interior perimeter of the space.  Families and friends chatted as they enjoyed their fragrant and colourful dishes.  Although Raj Palace can accommodate your party for dinner most of the business we observed came from take away orders.  This evening Dosa was the most popular item on the menu and it is dosa that makes this restaurant South Indian.  Dosa is a crepe that is cooked crisp, filled with potato masala, and served with chutney and sambar.  Masala is a blend of ground spices which commonly contains the earthiness of cumin, turmeric, coriander, and cardamom.  Chutney is a condiment that is a mixture of spice, vegetable, and fruit and Sambar is a vegetable broth.  These are explanations of the elements of the dish in their simplest terms.  We tried the special Palak Paneer Dosa with a spinach curried masala spread on a rice and lentil crepe and stuffed with potato masala.  It was light, crispy, earthy, and flavourful and free of gluten and meat if that is of interest to you.  Sampling the butter chicken was an absolute so that we could report back to our \"Indian Food\" Loving Posse.  The chicken was tender, nutty, buttery, and fragrant.  We ordered some garlic naan to mop up the sauce and found the flatbread itself to be delightful.  It had brilliant green pieces of cilantro baked throughout and was infused with garlic so it was tasty without being overpowering.  I have to give a shout out to the Mango Lassi.  Best I have tasted in the city.  We will be back to try the lamb and goat and fish dishes and are extra excited to sample the Chef's Specialty - Chicken Vepudu."}
{"text":"Why have I waited so long to come back here?!?! The food is fresh and delicious.  Friendly service, great atmosphere. Already looking forward to my next visit. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with big flavours! We are lucky to have a South Indian restaurant like this in Calgary. Of course they offer more well-known North Indian fare, but I personally love the Masala Dosa combo with sambar, idly, and vada.  Friendly service.  I hope that their business grows. Well done!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Staff is very friendly. I didn't like that the rice cost extra. I think that should have been included in the price of the entree. 5 stars for quality of food though"}
{"text":"the place is faboulas.neat and clean,friendly stuff mostly very tasty food they serve.dosa,idly and fish min moily love them"}
{"text":"The wife and I love this place! Really small and a little hard to find, we found it by luck and easily my favourite Indian restaurant in the city! We have both ordered takeout and ate in, food is always good and can't wait till I'm back there!"}
{"text":"This place blows all the nearby Indian restaurants nearby out of the water and that includes MM. Having been kicked out of our kitchen by my daughter's Friday night slumber party, the rest of us started looking for a place to eat. I have been wanting to try Raj Palace for a while now so we went. The place was packed upon arrival but several tables were just getting ready to leave so we were able to get a table in a decent amount of time. I'm not really familiar with South Indian Cuisine so we stuck with what we know...butter chicken for the boy, and a coconut beef curry for hubby. I picked 'onion bahji' for a starter but am not sure if that is what we ended up getting. They weren't like any onion bahji I've had before. We also had ordered naan and steamed rice with peas. If I was going to rate this place solely on the food I would give it 5 stars, however, the service was not so great. Our starters arrived with half of our dinner and the other half of the dinner took forever! They gave us some complimentary mango lassi's to make up for the lateness of the food. The mango lassi is amazing. You should make the trip here just for one of those delicious drinks! In addition to beer and wine they also have a tiny bar. I wouldn't call it a 'full bar'. We had a good chance to study the food of everyone around us (and yes, we were the only non Indian people in there) and it seemed many were here for the more Southern Indian Style dishes like Dhosa (which are large crepe- like rolls stuffed with potatoes and spices/curry) and a whole marinated and grilled Pomfret fish which we found out later is NOT on the menu and you have to know to ask for it. And now we know :) If you have no where to be and want great food and authentic atmosphere Raj Palace is the place for you."}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to find authentic SOUTH Indian food in Calgary?! Raj's Palace is a God send for those of us craving dosas, idly, vada and uttapam. They do a nice job with the popular Indian dishes people love (butter chicken, samosas, etc.) but what makes this place special is their South Indian offerings. The staff are friendly and attentive, I always notice them taking the time to explain dishes to their customers with pride and cheer."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Raj Palace. Their speciality is South Indian dishes like Dosas, but they also offer some North Indian fare.   I had dinner with my mom here on Friday. We were both craving Indian, and after some research on Yelp, I knew I wanted to try this place. After a disappointing experience at Moti Mahal right across the way, I was hoping I would get some good Indian food in my belly.   It's a smaller restaurant, probably around 12 tables in the whole place. When we arrived, we were very lucky as we got the last open table. We ordered some Vadas (lentil donuts), Chicken Tikka Masala and Goat Roganjosh. I had never tried Vadas before, but they were delicious. I was worried they would be really dense because they're made with lentils, but they were wonderful. I loved the dipping sauces that came with them as well. The Chicken Tikka Masala was really spicy, but that's how I like my food: with heat! It was really flavorful, definitely my favorite dish of the night. The Goat Roganjosh was also really well done. Goat is a difficult meat to cook, as it can become really tough in a matter of seconds. The goat was cooked perfectly, and I loved the sauce. I find Roganjosh is so inconsistent in many Indian restaurants in Calgary, and I loved the one at Raj Palace. It was still gravy-like, but not super heavy or salty. Perfect!  There are only two servers for the entire restaurant, so you can wait longer than usual for things. But it is so worth the wait! The staff are also super friendly. I definitely will be back soon, and you should go too."}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice. First time with my family and the second with my wife. The food is authentic South Indian and tastes great. There are many varieties. My old time favourite which I have not had in a long time was the rava thosai. The one here was great. I can make it a notch better but it's great to just have someone make and serve. Their puri was fantastic and their other dishes. My only advice would be to make sure you order everything you want at the start. It takes a while and ordering later may be a long wait depending on the crowd. The place is small but okay. I have yet to try their lassi. I have no hesitation to recommend this place to anyone who love South Indian. It is authentic and none of that fusion nonsense. I will be returning. As for cost, it can be a tad on the pricier side."}
{"text":"This is a great place for an Indian food crave. A piece of advice, reserve a table for a party of greater than 4 to prevent from waiting. The place is small, but the service was excellent, knowledgeable of the menu, offers suggestions to new people. It is also flexible in offering various spicy level.  I have visited this establishment twice upon writing this review and both occasions left me very satisfied. My recommendations are the following:  *Biryani (the orange rice in the picture) *Masala Uttapam *Gobi Manchurian (the other picture is a vegetarian dish, battered cauliflower, but using Indian spices) *Garlic Naan *Saffron Rice *Chicken Roganjosh *Mango Lassi (a yogurt-based drink with mango concentrate)  Overall, great food, tiny place, excellent service, speed of food delivery is slow, a bit pricey, but all worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic naan bread made in a tandoori oven. I've done take out here several time lately and have been very happy. My favourite is the lamb vindaloo."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Worth it. Great for gluten-free  people and anyone who loves Indian food. Small restaurant, friendly caring staff. I can't wait to go back. Make sure you ask for mild if you have trouble tolerating any hot spice."}
{"text":"This is my fav East Indian restaurant in the city. The food and service are exceptional. They have several locations in the city - my fav is In Midnapore. We love the dosas and the paneer!"}
{"text":"This is literally the best Indian food I've ever had. The staff are so friendly and informative. The menu is huge and everything is delicious.  The marsala dosa is amazing, the kulfi is dense and sweet, and the butter chicken changed my life. If I could eat here everyday I would.  If you haven't tried Indian this is a great place to start. The chef at this location is even better than the one up north. Thanks Raj palace for blowing my mind and taste buds. YOU ROCK."}
{"text":"Fantastic South Indian food.  I have made this my go to Indian place.  I am working my way through the entire menu, but the Chicken Chettinadu is a constant.  It is delicious, full of curry leaves.  I think you can judge the quality and authenticity of ethnic foods by the number of people indiginous to the food type in the restaurant.  I'm a white person, and in Raj Palace I am always in the minority.  Place is always full."}
{"text":"Just dropping in for some take away.  Though it's not a big restaurant,  they definitely have big flavor!   Jut the aroma as you enter is enough to make your stomach rumble."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Raj Palace instead of the usual Moti Mahal in Midnapore Mall and Karma in McKenzie. Decided we wanted to try some South Indian food because we like the spice level. For starters, we picked the chef's special Chicken Vepudu. The portion was very large for 2 people but the chicken was good. The cashews offered a nice contrast to the spice on the chicken. Then we decided to brave it and got the lamb vindaloo and the Chettinadu Chicken curry. The chicken curry was far superior and was just the right amount of spice. The Vindaloo was very spicy, the lady who worked there gave us fair warning but we decided to err on the side of super spicy. Nonetheless the flavor was good. We also ordered some Naan and Raita on the side. The raita was actually one of my favs in the city. It had a bit of a sweet/tangy undertone and was excellent.   A couple of notes on the restaurant itself. It's tucked away in the corner of the plaza with just a couple of tables. It's a bit tight but comfortable still. The staff working there was very friendly.   Will definitely be going back to Raj Palace again and again."}
{"text":"Even though they claim to be authentic South Indian restaurant, they do serve some North Indian dishes too. It's a small place. Has decent furniture. Has about 9-10 tables.  We were driving from California to Calgary and hadn't had Indian food in 4 days. So we decided to order some North Indian food. The food was decent. Presentation and taste were all good. We had orders yellow dal, palak paneer and aloo gobhi. Nan's are pretty good too.  The reason I am giving a four star is because we went on Sunday evening and the place was jam packed. Which is a good thing except these guys were severely short staffed. It took more than 10 mins to get water on our table. Otherwise, I would recommend this place and if I am ever in the area, I would go back there myself.  Parking is ok. 4 of us paid about $50 CAD. So I think it's pretty reasonable price wise."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The owner was very friendly, had a warm smile on his face the whole time.  Food was also great, I got the crepe with chicken. Also asked for very spicy and man, it was soooo spicy! But in a enjoyable way.  I just love the combination of all the different spices that Indian cuisine offers, created a very diverse taste palette. A coconut sauce and a curry sauce were offered on the side. The coconut sauce really balanced the spiciness of the chicken fillings. Got the mango lassi to end my meal, delicious! Will  go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his family and I frequent this restaurant and we love it. The food is amazing, the variety incredible, the staff are all so friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Great for a satisfying meal whether it be sit-in or takeout. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my family's very favorite Indian restaurant! South Indian is different from other styles of Indian food, so you won't see typical dishes like Butter Chicken. Be adventurous!  Order Chetanandu Chicken, Gobi Manchurian (dry), Coriander Prawns, Lamb Roganjosh, Chicken Tikka, Prawn Kurma (similar to Korma only Kurma is how South Indians spell it).  Dosa is a burrito shaped crepe filled with potato masala or lentil and rice. There is a huge party size dosa for 10 people, but the normal one is just right for 2-3 people to split. I see a lot of people order it as a meal, but I have too many favorite dishes to do that."}
{"text":"Raj Palace specializes in South Indian cuisine. With three locations in Calgary, you have your pick of the litter. We decided to grab a late Saturday afternoon snack/lunch and stuck with what they're best known for, which according to our Indian friend is their southern fare.  - Masala uttapam ($9.95) - thicker soft dosa topped with special spiced mix masala and mildly garnished. Served with sides of chutney and sambar. My buddy described it as being an Indian style pizza. It was my first time trying an uttapam and it was quite enjoyable. Very light and surprisingly filling. It reminded me somewhat of an omelette. Definitely give it a try if you've never had it. - 3x Ghee masala dosa ($9.95) - lentil and rice crepe made in clarified butter and stuffed with potato masala. Served with the same sides of chutney and sambar. My friends originally wanted the onion rava masala dosa but they were out of it already or apparently never have it on weekends because it's too time consuming to make.  Quoi? Doesn't make sense to have something on your menu that you don't have on your menu but c'est la vie. If you've never had dosas, they're interesting. The crepe is extremely long, light and has a slightly crispy texture. The inside had mild (aka. not spicy) potatoes. The only issue with dosas is that I find there's not much filling to it. It's good for a light snack but that's it."}
{"text":"Hello again!   In 2 words - eat here.   I ordered the following:  - Chicken Vepudu - Coconut Prawn Curry   Chicken Vepudu - oh so succulent pieces of well-marinated lightly-battered boneless chicken with spices and cashews. I dream about these at least once a week.   Coconut Prawn Curry - tender juicy prawns in a creamy coconut curry. I teared up while eating this. It reminded me of the last time I ate this here. SO good.   Raj Palace is one of the few restaurants I frequent during my Calgary visits. I hope to make my way through the menu, if I can only get past these 2 spectacular dishes.   Excellent service too - professional and courteous. Well done!   I have a Culinary Wall of Fame - Raj Palace has a spot on my wall, hands down."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to write a review and tell everyone about this lovely place hahaha.    Small space with approx 10 tables only...  Almost all tables are 4 person tables,  but can be pushed together if needed. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group... you may be waiting awhile for a table.   Family run with 3 locations across the city (the other locations are in royal oak and country hills).   Very friendly service.  Lots of variety on the menu to try. ...  Best of all...  The majority of the customers were Indian!!!  That MUST mean that it's good!!  Quite busy so get there early or else you'll be waiting outside as there's not much of a foyer.    They also offer take out (which I'm happy about)."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Raj Friday night. What a treat!  Every thing from the delicious nan to the succulent Vindaloo was perfect. The service was courteous and swift, the atmosphere relaxed and intimate. We were also surprised on how affordable the meal was, given the high quality ingredients. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had their goat sukka- now that tastes really good and the quantity is pretty good  .  I recommend their prawn vindaloo and goat Rogan josh too. The nice thing about this place is that they use all the authentic spices (which is a pretty long list ) and not the shortcut recipe which uses about 3 to 4 spices.  It's got a cafeteria feel to it, but don't let that put you off . As an Indian who cooks, this is my go to place for Indian food if I want to do takeout ."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food.  Try it you'll be happy you did.  Smaller restaurant, prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"I got a Masala Dossa for take out today. It was fine. I like that the place is nearby. Maybe I'll go back. It's a cute, clean little restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! One of the very few Indian restaurants in Calgary having really nice customer service. We always have gone with friends, just me and my husband too and have got the South Indian dishes.   I personally am a big fan of their \"dosa\" ( savoury rice flour crepes) . And uttapams( savoury rice pancakes). Decently priced they come with a coconut chutney and sambar( lentil curry) these are size of dips which are must with the crepes and pancakes.   Their chilly paneer, gobi manchurian and bonda are to die for !!! Be careful, they are nicely sized for appetisers so may be like a for the table type of order.   They also sell raw batter for the crepes and pancakes to be made home. I always take a tub home.   It's a must visit!"}
