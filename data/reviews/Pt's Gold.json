{"text":"Looking for something other than fast food for lunch my husband and I stopped in.  Right down the street from his work and just a few streets from mine we figured that we'd have plenty of time to eat and get back to our respective jobs within our hour lunch.  We were wrong.

When you enter there is a sign that instructs you to seat yourself; we did and the server came over within a couple of minutes.  She took our food and drink order and was off; after she dropped off our drinks however, we didn't see her again at our table though we did see her bouncing around to all of the other tables that had also come in.  As time ticked later and later I finally went to the bartender to ask for our check and a box and she shrugged and pointed to the server and then turned and walked away.  I naturally assumed that the woman was a mute but then I heard her speak to a person seated at the bar and realized she simply didn't want to be bothered by someone who wasn't \"her customer\".  

Once I finally managed to get the servers attention it still took a bit before we were able to get out the door.  I don't necessarily blame the server because if she's the only one working that speaks more of an issue with management scheduling than server ability but I can't believe that a manager never came out to help her.  

The food was okay for what it was but I would never go back for the lack of service alone."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying if I could give them a negative star I would, my fiancé and I watched this place being built and couldn't wait to try it.. So last night we thought we'd give it a try, we walked in there was no welcome, no \"hi guys how is your night going?\" Nothing like that, so we walked in and sat at two machines and started to put money in, a little afterwards bartender came up asked what we were having and we order.. Now mind you I order a Malibu pineapple and my fiancé order a sprite and Three olives grape, cool so we aren't new to the whole play and get your drink comp, anyways we ask to see menu's and when we were ready to order the bartender took over 20 mins to even realize we were still there.. Mind you I do not do good with service people who can't do there job,it makes me super upset when someone can't do there job, but no instead she was flirting with the guys that walked in 15 mins after us. 

Now on to the food my wings were ice cold, my fries were soggy the flavor was good probably would have been better if my food was hot. I asked the bartender for another thing of ranch and misheard me for another round of drinks. Whatever I guess it happens. My fiances food was alright she usually demolishes her Wings, she barely ate them none the less the fries. 

I'd say I would like to give this place another try but after seeing my bill(4 drinks and over $100 played) and the shitty service we will not be returning.

If service was better and knew how to treat the players we would return. I guess we will still be looking for a new hang out or returning to old ones."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here a day after it opened, and this place was awesome!  The interior design was nice, the servers were friendly, and there were plenty of TV's to watch.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in, it smells like one giant cigarette. I don't want that in my day, so I will never go there again, and neither will those that know me."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars for this place! I really tried to support my local restaurant, however the service I received today was just criminal. Ordered a happy hour drink and a pizza for dinner @ 645. When the drink came it was horrible, so I sent it back for a do over. They brought me another drink, just as horrible as the first, but I kept it, as I did not want to upset the bartender. Pizza comes and we enjoyed it, however the bill to follow charged me with 2 drinks. I explained to Bria(waitress), that I only had one drink and furthermore, the second was twice as expensive as the first. Bria told me that the \"do over drink\" was after Happy hours (7pm) so it was @ regular price. I explained that I did not drink the first and the second should not have been charged, esp at regular price. She said the bartender/ manager told her to charge me for 2, when she clearly knew I only had 2nd one, as she dumped the 1st one herself. I was a fan of having a local pub, but if this is how you do business, I will take my business elsewhere. Keep in mind we are only talking 6 bucks, but for me it's the principle. I paid the bill as I did not want to make a scene, but they lost a potential frequent customer. With hopes of a grand opening, and now a grand closing!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment at PT's! Especially this one with the nice lounge area in the back and two pool tables. Food comes out fresh and tasty and their pizza's cannot be beat! Especially for $9 on Happy Hour. Definitely my bar of choice!"}
{"text":"Great gaming, excellent bartenders, tasty Ice cold beer and cocktails. Happy hour 5-7pm and then again 12-2am. Can't beat this place for all it has to offer!!"}
{"text":"WORST service ever by the most miserable bartender who seems to hate life and everyone who walks into the bar!  His name is Tweed, you will recognize him because he's the Michael Myers looking guy with the messed up hair who looks like he has a tumbleweed sitting on his head.  He won't acknowledge you, we literally had to flag him down after sitting at the bar for 20 minutes, and his shit attitude will cause this place to lose a lot of business.  #BYESWEETHEART #NEVERAGAIN"}
{"text":"I got two Long Island ice teas and they were made wrong I asked the bartender and he said oh I was out of an ingredient and I had to substitute it I told him I should of been aware and he then told me he'll make me a new drink no charge , got the bill and not only did he charge me for the drink he took and spilled out he wouldn't take it of the tab and not being the one to argue I payed tipped him and left , not a giant problem but being that I got to pt's often I'll expect to be shown love , what happened to service with a smile smh"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time in a few months and pleasantly surprised and stoked to see the TV upgrades/remodel. 

Finally a PTs with TVs like a real sports bar!  Great flat screens and plenty of them.

Plus Robby behind the bar.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with 1/2 off drinks from 5-7pm 12-2am. Come here for the drinks and back again for the service. Mike, Shelly, & James hold it down. Thirst is always quenched yet mike finds a way to get US wanting another tall one. Dim lit rectangle bar with surrounding tables & 2 pool tables in the back. Great undisturbed relaxation for a drink or 5 and great company. And please request \"846 the boom box\" channel on the tunes; there's no jukebox, but you can't go wrong with old school late 80's early 90's hip hop. 
PTs Anne and Camino, 
Certified quality Customer service."}
{"text":"Shelly is an amazing bartender she's so amazing we tried all the specialty drinks and they were so great new spot Shelly is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Pear cider on tap and great ground beef quesudilla's!!!!"}
{"text":"After a day of touring the Hoover Dam my friends and I were anxious to find a place to watch our UConn Huskies take on Pitt in the Big East opener. We decided to try our luck off strip. After driving around in circles for 20 minutes we happened upon PT's and went in because the game was starting in 10 minutes. Upon entering the darkly lit bar we were surprised to find that it was spacious and had numerous televisions set to the UConn game, even though a highly anticipated Monday night football match up between the Saints and Falcons was on. The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful, and recommended the nachos and half-price pizza for us out of towners. The nachos were among the best I have ever had. The steak was tender and not undercooked, while the fresh jalapenos and roasted tomatoes complemented the crispy tortilla chips and warm nacho cheese. The pizza was nothing compared to New Haven pizza, but was thin crust and hit the spot. For $6 it would be hard to complain. Drinks were half-price for happy hour, so I was able to get two huge mugs of Fat Tire (aka nectar of the gods) for about $6, while my friend got 2 Buds for the same price. During halftime we played a round of pool on one of the huge pool tables and people-watched as a group of UNLV students played beer pong at one of the designated tables. I highly recommend this bar for anyone who wants to get away from the strip for some good deals on food and beer and a great place to watch your team. BONUS: It is also in a strip mall with a Von's where we were able to stock up on Tecate, limes, water, Gatorade and all of the toiletries we forgot to pack for our trip."}
{"text":"Went to get some food and have a drink and it took them 15 minutes to even greet us and another 30 minutes to even take our order. When the apps came out the cheese that goes with the pretzels was cold and the artichoke spinach dip was room temperature. finally dinner came out and my girlfriend was looking forward to the pepperoni pizza she ordered and i was looking forward to my philly cheese steak both with came out looking great but wasn't even worth giving it to a homeless man or woman. This place sucks and so does their service. 10 thumbs down. the only reason they received one star is because i can't give them a negative one!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop and have a few drinks and a little video poker,awesome bartenders, they.make my drinsk just the way I like them. I will continue to visit this one, its not a packed place,a pretty chill environment!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few weeks. Sadly, my experience was the same both times. 

We sat on the couches near the dart boards to watch the rugby match. First, the genius who put the dart boards near the TVs...NOT a genius. When people are playing darts they block the view of the TV's. I came to watch a rugby match & drink...this mission not accomplished. But not bc of this alone. 

Service is crap. Period. BOTH visits our server was rude. The first visit the server got a $20 tip on a $20 tab bc my date is a bartender & a generous guy...I wouldn't have left you a penny. Our second visit...Whoever the dark haired snot is that worked Saturday night around 10:30pm...I hope my date didn't tip you bc not only were you rude, you couldn't be bothered to do your job.  That I had to ask you for a menu, ask you if I could order food & ask you if you would take my drink order was disgusting. Forget we waited 20 minutes for you to appear just to ask you for a menu, but when you did appear you're condescending & asked \"What do you want?\" Sorry...you're there to do a job-serve-I certainly wasn't there to give you money without you having earned it.  

I'll go to Maryland Pkwy or St. Rose location. Not impressed by the lazy & rude staff at this place.  Food is \"okay.\"  Definitely overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great service, but the food is consistently horrible."}
{"text":"Great pancakes!!! Chris and Ashley are awesome! A new neighborhood place to have some good food."}
{"text":"Prices were good because of the late night happy hour but the service from the one bartender was horrendous. I'm not going back. He obviously doesn't care about working for tips!! I walked in and it took 30 minutes for him to to even acknowledge me and my boyfriend. Then he didn't come back around for our food order or another 45 minutes."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and watched this place being built.  We were excited to try it when it opened.  We went in today around noon and found one big open smoking room, with no non-smoking area for dining.   We had to leave because my Mom is on oxygen and we don't like to eat in a smoky environment.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Staff during the day doesn't seem to make much effort. Nights are slightly better. Service sucks, food is decent but half-added compared to other locations. After this location opened, it is as if they stopped caring. Drive the extra mile to the Sierra Gold on Warm Springs and Stephanie for quality. I know I will."}
{"text":"This is probably my favored place o hang out for a cold beer and shots, stuff are very friendly especially Leontray wry friendy ad funny we will most definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong beer nice cold.......but 2 blonde employees working their til 12am all they talked about, complains about customers while we're listening made me very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Live close by and wanted to support a local business.  Was disappointed to find there was no pool table or shuffleboard anywhere to be seen.  Bartenders and the female manager were trying their best to establish a repoire with the clientele - was nice to see.  We heard the pizza was good, but the food we ordered off the menu was mediocre.  Overall, will be back for the convenient locale, once they get a pool table."}
{"text":"This is a new neighborhood gem. Really fun industrial decor - tons of gorgeous TVs and super friendly staff. The food is awesome and the machines were super hot while we were there. This beats the other gaming bars in SoHi hands down."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this one! frequent on graveyard happy hour and they're always on point!!"}
{"text":"Was in Christmas Eve, not real busy. I was with my family, sat at a machine, put $5 in and ordered a soda. A diet soda, I'm diabetic. Steve gives me a regular Coke. He comes up and says he knows what I'm doing, that I can't put money in and just sit there. I was a gaming bartender, I know how it works and that's their money. The whole row of machines was empty and I cashed out and stood there while my machine remained empty the rest of the night. Clearly I wasn't playing enough for Stevens liking. There's a PTs less than a mile away. I'm not going back to this one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite PTs on this side of town! The bartenders are cool, the mugs are frosty- plus half off drinks from 5-7pm after work, I'm there! The bartenders are the best too, they're all so nice! Mikey & Steve rock!"}
{"text":"We just recently moved to Vegas and were looking for a nice local pub and we found it a this PT's. We come here about twice a week during Happy Hour.  Love the nachos, wings and Pizza.  Great price on beers during Happy Hour.  Big shout out to the gals that wait on the tables.  They always remember our favorite beer and serve it to us with us not having to ask...love it  :-)"}
{"text":"the location is convenient and the interior and patio are relatively nice especially for at PT's however it was the worst breakfast burrito I've ever eaten and they ripped me off, albeit for a few dollars, but I was overcharged and was refused when i requested it be fixed. I would have returned it and left if i wasn't starving.  The breakfast burrito comes with two ingredients from their list and between certain hours it is half price. I ordered bacon and avocado on my burrito and was not warned that avocado was extra (and not half off) nor that I was going to be missing out by not getting my other ingredient. The eggs aren't real eggs, the bacon was maybe a slice and terrible, and the avocado is the only edible portion of the burrito. The tortilla was also cheap. I've had better breakfast burritos at Jack in the Box and del Taco off the dollar menu. I don't expect any good food from these establishments, so that wasn't surprising, but when i got my bill, it was wrong. I ordered a burrito with two ingredients during half-off hours. Make it work as advertised. she claimed the computer did it and she had no control over it. Total BS. Would not order anything but beer from these places. The wings are overpriced but are the only decent thing on the menu."}
{"text":"A group of us met up there for a drink and some food.  The place was not busy at all but what do I expect for a Tuesday night.  The server was nice but was really slow.  She even forgot a round we had ordered.  The real disappointment was the food.  We ordered wings and tenders typical bar food.  The wing were small and overcooked.  The tenders were as small as the wings and also overcooked.   All which had no flavor.  Really, I have had better chicken at KFC and I hate that place.  We would have said something to the server but she was hard to find.  Wouldn't be returning to this bar."}
{"text":"Jed and Robin are the best bartenders in town, the beer is ice cold, and you never have to wait for a drink. Great bar!"}
{"text":"Easily the best PT's location in Las Vegas! Sarena is the best bartender that you'll ever come by! She's literally the reason we always come to this bar because she's so personable and friendly with everyone that steps inside those doors! The bar is always kept in good condition and doesn't wreak of cigarettes like most of the other locations!"}
{"text":"Crappy service.  Dirty bathrooms. Bartender spent more time on her phone than interacting with customers.  Cold food brought out at separate times than my friends food.   This place is awful.  Go to the Lodge!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour like all PT's. I prefer this location for convenience, their patio and music selections. The staff is as freindly as they can be in a volume place like that but are attentive enough to know they are trying."}
{"text":"This guy had no idea about the menu, my pizza came out cold and was rude.  His name was Steven.. If you care about local regulars and a business doing well you would change the staff. Which is easy to fix. Just don't hire people that are not personable and demand tips before they even take your order. How rude. It was a horrible experience.."}
{"text":"Food is aight, but the soda is terrible. I've been there 3 times and every time the Pepsi taste like it's being run through dirty lines."}
{"text":"Nothing nice to say.  Food was cold and terrible.  I was so disapointed in the food for 2 at a cost of $40.00 only drank cokes.  I sent an email to PT's Corporate.  Never received any type of response.  I had not been in this Pt\"s in years, do to a similar experince.  Gave it another chance, won't ever give it another.  Terrible food and with no response to my email I doubt I will ever enter another PT's again."}
{"text":"So I moved here a year ago and this is my home away from home! Everyone here is family !if your looking for a cool bar that plays hip hop/Kroq this is your spot !!  
Ask for Nikki,zack,Steve or mikey !!! These are mire than bartenders their family"}
{"text":"I've tried the burger, pretzels and steak nachos. They were very delicious and the steak served with the nachos was quality meat. All three meals were very reasonable priced. 

I don't drink alcohol and they have a good selection of non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. 

I even won $200 playing Keno on $20.... SCORED!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night around 5. There were two blonde batenders working. The place had maybe 8 people in it including my party of 3. We each put in a $20 and slow played it since it wasn't a gambling night and we were catching up with an old friend. The bartenders were stuck up and were anything but friendly. I mean isn't that part of the job description? At the end of the night after I few shots we were charged entirely for our drinks even though we had lost $60 because we played under the minimum. I think there's something wrong with that. Isn't the rule $20 equals one drink? Now you want to add in the minimum play rule? Well I still lost my $20? It isn't so much about the money but the way we were treated. I will never go here again. There's a Village Pub down the street with bartenders who know your name and oh yeah, better food too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Graveyard bartenders are awesome and 12am-2am is half off all drinks and food. The \"Gilroy\" pizza is freakin amazing!"}
{"text":"This used to be my spot until tonight. I went for the midnight happy hour and was completely ignored by the sad sack of a bartender who didn't even look my way. He circled his habitat with a crooked back permanently bent at a 30 degree angle from lack of balls or intuition. The bastard had tits for brains. big fat ones that left little room for intelligence. Gravity is heavy for that hapless heathen. I almost got mad, but then realized he has to live that way forever. A sucker. So we left and went to B-dubs instead and had a good meal.

After midnight PT's reminded me of a saloon from Star Wars: full of misfits who are unable to wrap a belt through all the loops, or figure out what clothes to wear in public so they dress in table cloths and shower curtains.  

I lived in Las Vegas for damn near 9 years now and never saw such a low-life scum-sucking bartender than the eunuch serving drinks at PT's tonight. What sort of man hunches like a hound and doesn't even ask someone what they would like to drink?? Give that mutt a towel and send him to a Terrible's gas station."}
{"text":"Bartender sucks!!! So rude. Ordered one drink and tipped her $10 hoping for better service but noooooo. Skinny blond rude as Hell. We are locals and will never come back and be sure to tell every one we know."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, food, and service. Beef sliders are awesome, as are the wings. We got jack and coke and a fuzzy navel, exactly what we expected. Definitely worth each of the 5 stars! Coming back for sure to try some new dishes."}
{"text":"Good food good beer!!!  Great service!!'nn"}
{"text":"We were playing 20.00 each and didn't even get comped for bottled water. Who doesn't comp water when u play. I guess the Bartender doesn't know how to make any money.."}
{"text":"Local watering hole - decent food and nice service. Great place to get away from the heat!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible. TERRIBLE! The worst service and the bartender doesn't know how to make or mix drinks. Ordered a greyhound and received a drink with cranberry vodka and rancid grapefruit juice. Didn't know how to make a lemon drop either. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"So I randomly stopped by to check this place out with my fiancé. Wow. It was recently renovated and looks AMAZING. The service was fast, attentive, and super friendly. James and Liz more than took care of us. We cannot thank y'all enough for such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"This PTs Gold, is smokey and noisy, and crowded.   If that is what you like then this one is for you.

We prefer to meet up with our friends for great food and conversation in a more calm atmosphere and less smelly/smokey.

We always just 2 blocks south on Eastern to PTs PUB.
that is far better.

They just don't advertise as much.

They are located just behind Village Pub, on Eastern and Sunridge Heights, kind of hidden, but a great place!!

They also have a Great pizza and happy hour special.

We can buy a pizza and 2 drinks for $13.00 during 4pm and 7pm.

The waitress is a sweetheart, but bored, because it is so slow.

Come on PT PUB ON SUNRIDGE HEIGHTS & EASTERN, advertise!!  Don't go out of business, we love you."}
{"text":"Nice bar close to the airport. I like the outside seating viewing the airport and the strip. The bartenders are great. Good spot!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour..half priced drinks and pizza's. Great seating area including booths and they have a separate nonsmoking area if you'd like to just dine in."}
{"text":"Went here for a party for a friend who found a new job (Congrats Jo!), and they have a great patio seating area.  There are high-top tables, and some lounge couches. There is also a nice inside area you can reserve for group gatherings. The happy hour prices for the food and drinks are a good deal.  Most of the staff are pretty friendly, and it has Golden Tee for those of you who like that game."}
{"text":"I had a great time here hanging out Friday night.  Bartender was on the ball and fun.  Food was surprisingly tasty.  Music was fine.  My only complaint is that it was too smokey inside.  But that is Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came to stop by at a birthday party , was not even inside and right away she asks if we are paying separate or together? Then again this is a bar so I should expect this type of rudeness. I ordered chicken tenders and they were as hard as a rock . Almost burnt , very dry and beyond salty . It's not the waitresses fault it's the managers . Please whoever runs this junk whole , get a new frozen food server. Try your own tenders and let me know if you would serve this to your family , or kids  . I requested a new plate , mind you it's been 25minutes !!! Then she brought the same hard as a rock chicken tenders . I was so hungry and waited now 1.5 hours for 4 tenders to hurt my teeth and still charge me the full price. I would like to know the management running this place . If I could rate -1 , believe me I would..."}
{"text":"This is the best pt's interior above all the others. Not dark and smokey. With high ceilings and spacious appeal, this design rocks. Staff very pleasant and eager to serve you even if you are not loading the machines up with alot of hundreds. Really appreciate the new design of the PTS Gold brand"}
{"text":"The location is great, but the service is absolutely terrible. It took forever to get drinks and even longer to get the bill. Once we finally got the bill, the bar tender took another 15 minutes before she came by and instead of taking the credit card to run, she took the empty glasses and then disappeared with her make-up bag towards the bathrooms for another 10 minutes. I will not return"}
{"text":"So I've been to this bar many times, and liked it.  Sherry the manager is great, Sara is awesome too, and today i met a trainee named Suhmer (summer, thats how she spells it..lol)...who was a doll...and i hope to see her again.  BUT, the new assistant manager who's name i think is Wesely (a woman) is not worth your time or,money .  She wont comp your drinks right if you put 100 in the machine she may comp you one draft beer...then charge you on any other beer..plus good luck getting good service from her...she just pays attention to her freinds and lets empty beer glasses sit in front of you while she talks .  Once she was holding my beer in her hand and talking up her friend while i was like...can i have my beer now please.   This bar would do much better if they got rid of her and hired Suhmer....Suhmers second day of training and is way better than Wesely...hands down"}
{"text":"Happy hour is good. Food is pretty mediocre. Stopped coming here one night after the bartender Steve told my wife and I to step away from a half empty bar because we weren't gambling, after I had just finished playing 10 dollars in the machine in front of me. I was honestly shocked because I had been in this place a couple of times a week for months and was familiar with the bartender. Why ask a regular paying customer to sit away from the bar when there are like 15 open spots with machines? I really liked this place but this experience will keep me from ever returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and fantastic jessica and gina the bartenders are so lively and courteous. 
I will go back to this place again and again. 
This home my home now because of them..:)
Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Great little local with half price specials from 4-8pm & after midnight until early morning. Friendly and busy staff, fair bar food, loads of flatscreen in HD, 3 pool tables and a large sofa area for sitting comfort.

PT's is a local bar, where the drinks are almost 1/3th the price a tourist will pay at the main attractions."}
{"text":"I had been to two other PT's for breakfast in the past few weeks (a) Buffalo & 215; breakfast was edible but not worth returning and (b) Sierra Gold 215 & Jones, worked but nothing to write home about.  I was still looking for a great option for breakfast and low and behold I found myself at PT's at Post Road and 215 (near Sunset, west of the 215).  I know that it was converted to a PT's not that long ago and this was my first visit.  We were instantly welcomed by Serena who gave us great service and friendly conversation during our visit.  We (2 people) ordered breakfast and were presented absolutely perfect plates of bacon, eggs, and omelet goodness by our cook, Kevin.  He later walked through the area after delivering another order and after we told him how good it was, he responding that he was just doing his job.  PT's has to wonderful employees with Sererna and Kevin.  And to top it off, PTs has breakfast specials!  What a deal! Serena and Kevin are the kind of staff that keep the customers coming back over and over.  Keep up the good work and this is my new go to place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I don't normally yelp, but felt i should this time. I almost never cam eback to this PTs due to an experience i had had with a blonde bartender. My friends wanted to stop for a drink,  so i reluctantly went with them. I was pleasantly suprized when we were greeted by Emily. It changed my pov an we will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Awful food and service! Food was cold and gross. Service was slow and she didn't seem to care at all. I will never go back with the intentions of eating."}
{"text":"Frequently visit this location because it is close to my apartment, and on my way home from work.

I usually sit at the bar and order boneless wings or various appetizers. Everything has been very good, and I typically look forward to the wings. 

The atmosphere is very laid-back, with pool tables and video games separated from the bar. If gaming is your thing, they also have video poker at the bar. It's definitely a good atmosphere to sit back, relax, and have a few drinks with good food. The bartenders are very friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"I always visit thus location when I visit my parents in Henderson.  The staff has always been friendly, the service good and they have great food."}
{"text":"Good clean bar with nice TV's.  The games never seem to pay out for me but I guess that's gambling.  The food always comes out in a timely manner and surprisingly was better than expected."}
{"text":"15 minutes waiting for a beer and the bartender could not stop talking to his friends. Even the server was getting  annoyed.

If they were busy then I would have understood."}
{"text":"Love coming to this PT's for football on Sundays. They have all the games on and great service especially w/ how busy it is."}
{"text":"Presentation , needless, very cool atmosphere, have not tried the food yet. Beer is awesome, great temperature and refreshing taste. (Ashly) is my go to waitress. She's friendly, caring and just has a great vibe and awesome personality that keeps us coming back. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! staff is always friendly. I look forward to going for my favorite Martini. Keep up the great work. Also, love the nachos!"}
{"text":"It sucks that I have to give 2 stars for food from a place that used to be quite good.  But it sucks even more that we paid $31 and change for less than mediocre food.  We ordered to go food last night.  We purchased a french dip, their November wing special and a club sandwich.  

First off the french dip was barely edible.  It had shredded beef and was over salted and way too much pepper.  That was my dinner.  My husband ate half and we threw half away.  The wings were breaded and fried and came with fries.  Pretty good deal for the price.  However hubby ordered plain with mild sauce on the side.  The wings, unsauced, were very spicy so just be aware. How is that even possible?  And the club sandwich was okay.  The bread was greasy from the cheese.  It's like they grilled the cheese and then added the cold meats.  The fries that came with the food were good.

The french dip was almost $12.00, the wings $7.00 and the club sandwich I think was around $10.00 or so."}
{"text":"I've received nothing but good service in this bar from Liz. If you do not, then you've done something wrong. Don't be a dick in a bar and expect good service in return."}
{"text":"Drinks and bartender always what I need them to be. It's a slight bummer that there is only 2 pool tables so we had to wait a decently long while to get our game on. People are always chill and occupied with their own business to bug. This place is also a Pokéstop. Just saying."}

{"text":"So if your looking for bad customer service this the pts for you Amy the blonde bartender and the other bartender was worst let's call her the plus size bartender with the tattoo sleeve I don't know her name because  she kept her back to us all night trying to make a love connection with a customer. After requesting water three times with a bar that only had 5 patrons I had to get up out of my seat interrupt Amy during her Facebook trolling then after she finished her post she grab my water ,but I still had to wait until she finished the three way conversation with their friend who was clearly getting comp drink but not playing any games, so in future the customers who are gambling should at least get greeted by both bartender and should be checked up on every now and then  and stop letting their friend drink for free especially if there not gambling"}
{"text":"Some people trying to start a fight and greg the bartender handled them great without conflict. That's why I am here great food good times great bartender."}
{"text":"Gave this place two chances. First chance, I was trying to buy a pizza for my employees. I called and made the order and when I showed up they had no pizza. In fact, a manager came out and lied to my face and said the pizza got cold so they have to remake it. I didn't have time to wait so I left.

Second chance, my wife and I stopped by for a drink around 1020pm. The waitress didn't come back after our first order until 1125pm. One hour and we had one drink and left. TERRIBLE service!

Never going back again!"}
{"text":"I have had the best oatmeal cookie shot here. There is no comparison."}
{"text":"Hubby, sis, and I came here for some late night grub.  We ordered cheese quesadillas, mini sliders, and a breakfast platter.  Food is OK, typical bar food.  Hubby and I ordered the beer on special, $4 for a large pint (maybe 20 oz?)...not bad.

We were the only ones in the dining area so we had the server all to ourselves.  She was nice, attentive, and friendly.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Half price drinks 5-7 and 12-2 it's a chill place and the food is pretty good. Definitely a regular place for me"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER.  Bartenders ignore you and wait over 30 mins to refill a drink.  Bartenders are lackadaisical.  I've been waiting 26 mins to get a drink while I write this and 3 bartenders walk by.  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"It's a bar with nachos, beer, and sports on at all times. It's clean. The staff are friendly.  Ok. I love the space where you sit on couches and armchairs with a game in front as it it was you own place.   Made me feel right at home- a clean home. 
Also there are 2-3 pool tables in the back area.  Nice to see age groups vary and all are welcome."}
{"text":"I ve been to lot of other PT s in las vegas but this place is definitely best and adorable!!!  The outside patio is best mood setting for everyone. Usually go there at night time, sometimes fox come by and eat some food from employee.  And lady who works at night all the time serves us so nicely."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to go. Whether it is this PTs or another one. Great evening bartenders. I normally catch the late night happy hour and Bonnie and Manny are the best! Always a great time with my friends and bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service my husband and I have had in a while. First, it took 25 minutes to get the attention of the waitress to order our drinks and another additional 20 minutes for them to put the game on we ask for when we first walked in. This made my husband very discouraged because he missed the first quarter of the game he was looking forward to. It took the waitress another 45 minutes before our order for food was taken. Another half an hr later when we finally got our food, it came out way overdone. I would have understood this type of service if the place was packed. However, when there is only 5 maybe 6 tables occupied, this type of service is ridiculous especially for a sports bar on football sunday. We felt extremely neglected seeing we barely ever saw any wait staff on the floor."}
{"text":"I hope you don't get Javier as your bartender. He was very unknowledgeable about porters and stouts. He recommended goose ipa and Brooklyn lager..., he was also on his phone and, openly discussing about the discount he gets, to his  patrons and how he can void items etc. meanwhile I dropped 30 bucks on the keno and ordered 2 chicken Caesars( witch were amazing)., ( that took 20 min ) he did not comp my $7.30 Newcastle my bill was $40.13 for two drinks and really bad service as he continued to cater and practically give the bar away to friends. I hope this post is read by the PTs entertainment group for the property on Silverado and Maryland prkwy. One star for JAVIER & 1 star to the business for hiring such poor staff. PTs entertainment is great company but will loose quality Las Vegas patrons for this. The place, food and atmosphere is great just POOR bartdnders.  HOPE ya's get a proper bar host. Thank you for reading.  Note: the time was around 2am on 10/13/15"}

{"text":"Where should I start, Mandi and Monica, Ozzy & Tweed and Curtis are freaking awesome. I've been coming here for 2 months now and I can say these guys are more then servers and bartenders. They pay attention to what you say and hold solid conversations while sitting at the bar. Mandi and her crew are on point with service. I would consider them now friends them just servers. They are all about you and you only. The bar is super clean and I love the company while enjoying a cocktail. Love this place and the crew. Big thank you to Mandi & her crew for running the best bar in town. I love them all."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. Wasn't impressed when I was in here last spring. Thought I would give it a try a couple of weeks ago. Glad I did!  The service at the bar was excellent! Traci, the bartender and a new addition,   gave me and the others at the bar her full attention and made all of us want to come back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing bar and place to eat!! 
I visit here 2 to 3 times a week to enjoy not only the food but the staff!! 
Cesar is absolutely amazing and makes us laugh which is needed after a long day of work! 
My friend and I never have to tell him what we are eating or drinking he always remembers and that says a lot so thank you Cesar and all the staff at Pt's !!
Definitely a place you want to hang out!!"}

{"text":"So whatever Alyssa is making here is not enough. PTEG, if you read this, you need to give this fantastic employee a raise. So I've hated on this place in the past, yet today, due to already having had breakfast at a Sierra Gold and spending like 4 hours there then coming here afterwards, I felt like a loser with no life going back to the same bar, so I went to a different bar so they wouldn't know how little of a life a I actually have. Alyssa was attentive from the start, greeting everyone as they walked in the door with a \"welcome\" and a gorgeous smile. She was attentive throughout my stay there, was witty with her back and forth banter, and gave her recommendations for food choices when I asked with appropriate requests and ridiculous demands on my part. In essence, she's the kind of bartender that turns a guy who comes on occasion into a regular. PTEG, as I've stated already, give a raise, promote, or sculpt this woman into your management circle, because she fucking gets it. This place earns my business again after destroying Beano's."}
{"text":"So I was trying to find a customer Service email address online but can't find one so here it is. My boyfriend and I, along with a couple friend of ours (4 of us total) went here last night for the first time. The atmosphere was nice and Jodi was nice enough as well. We started ordering drinks and about 3 in we all realized our drinks were crazy weak, and asked the bartender (Jodi) to top us off, which she did. So we all order about one more drink each, still pretty disappointed in how weak the drinks had been originally. My boyfriend and his friend had each played about $10 a piece on the machines- no complimentary drinks. Then we get the bill and see that an automatic $16 gratuity was added. For a \"large party\". I didn't realize our party of 4 people could be considered large, not to mention each couple paid separately. On top of that, $16 is nearly 25% on a $67 tab which is ridiculous. We live so nearby but I can't imagine coming back for crazy overpriced service and Under poured drinks. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here with a buddy after work and were having drinks and food and then the UNLV game comes on so loud that  you cant hear your self think or talk to the person across from you at the bar. I asked the Bartender Mark if he could lower it and he got an attitude and he later told his boss Todd Parmelee Director of Operations that me and my buddy said a curse word at him, which did not happen and then I got a nasty email from Todd Parmelee. I will never go their again and the service is horrible. Todd Parmelee recommended for me to take my business to Buffalo Wild Wings. By the looks of it Todd your bar is not getting the best reviews maybe you should quit covering for lazy employees."}
{"text":"I am going to be completely honest here, I hate yelp reviews. I find them to be so terrible and unjust for anyone in the industry until this evening. The bartender was rude, very short and condescending with me when I inquired their tequila selection. I also encountered Megan, who was absolutely unpleasant all evening, IF we even had the honor of her presence from time to time during our visit. If that was not enough, she had even CURSED at us during our cashout! When a member of our party was charged for a shot that they had never ordered she said \"Seriously, it's three dollars. Fuck it, ill take care of it. Whatever\". I had to inform her that it is serious when it is something that was never ordered. She was rude from the beginning and after enough of her high horse attitude we cancelled our salad because we just wanted to leave at that point and the bartender had the audacity to say \"The one in the red shorts\" (speaking of me infront of my finacee who only wanted to leave at that point) continued to say \"its time for them to leave.\" Honestly if you are in the industry, BEWARE OF THIS PTS!!!! It was a terrible experience and it only got worse. I like to expect the best in people but this left such a bad taste in my mouth I can't justify this terrible service."}
{"text":"Went to this place for late night food, the service was very good but the food was horrible! The nachos were horrible hardly any cheese and I ordered the steak to be cooked medium to medium rare and it was basically rare! The chips were super salty, the salsa tasted gross as well. My friend ordered sliders and got very sick after eating them, she was vomiting and had diarrhea."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local hangout in Henderson. There are PTs everywhere in the valley, but this one has a cool firepit outside and a fun group of regulars. I normally come late Thursday or Friday night to take advantage of the half proced beers and pizzas. 

The bartender Greg is a Steelers fan (which is forgivable) remembers your name and your beer (which is awesome) and always makes sure people are taken care of and enjoying themselves. 

The food offerings are standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, pizzas, but its always worth checking out the monthly specials menu. Bourbon wings, buffalo chicken sandwiches, black and blue burgers, there's usually something that is pretty damn good and reasonably priced to boot. 

All in all, you can't go wrong with this location if you're looking for a spot for good eats, cold beer and a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Only second time in the place.  First time was mediocre at best.  Walked in tonight thinking great, watch some football,  get a beer and something to eat.   Sat down at a table by the bar.  Now we wait, and wait and wait.  Then someone else walks in, sits at the bar, a guy, I guess you could call him a bartender  in a ratty 49ers the shirt that looked like he slept in it all weekend help him and got him a drink.  Now he walks around the bar, speaks to no one and goes and plays with the register.   So I continue to wait, and wait, and wait.  There are two other people I am guessing work there standing against the wall holding it up watching everything and talking.   Finally we get up and walk out.  PTs is a great place to go unless you want something to eat or drink and enjoy being ignored.  Won't be back, thanks for making it easy PTs."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, the bartenders are fast, friendly and happy! love going in for happy hour. Food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"First time in this location since PT's took it over and remodeled it. What a great place!  Happy hour was a blast!  Food and atmosphere were great!  Love the outdoor patio and the cool touches in the bar (like USB charging ports). Best part of the night was our bartender Liz...she was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. She had us laughing the whole time and made us feel like we were right at home. Great job on the remodel PTs, and for hiring Liz...she's a gem.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service ever! I bought a pizza and did not know it was on happy hour and when I went to take it to go this bartender snatches the box from us and the slice my boyfriend was about to put in his mouth... And tells us that that's not how it works and said we couldn't get it on the happy hour price but we didn't care what the price was and could have been paid more but he didn't even offer that then when we tell him the pizza was for our 18 month old son he brought it back and said it is on me, BUT WE ALREADY PAID FOR IT! So we ended up leaving and brought the pizza back and got our money back but he only gave us $7 back and we paid $8.50!!!! wtf don't go to this place it is all bad smh"}
{"text":"Deano the bartender was very nice and very good with customer service. But the philly cheese steak! OMG! That thing was SO SALTY! I will never ever get in my life again"}
{"text":"Absolutely worse service and experience I have ever seen at PT's in the last 8 years of living in Las Vegas.  I am a golden rewards member and pretty much only game at Pt's or Sierra Gold.  So I stopped at Pt's right next to my apartment tonight to have a couple drinks and some food.  I was at the bar by myself gaming and my friends arrived so I cashed out, tipped kindly and moved to a table right behind me at the bar.  The server must have just ended her shift, she was on her phone and ignoring us.  We just wanted a quick bite and another drink.  We gave up on her after 20 plus min.  Went to the bar and ordered food.  The food came quickly and was great.  The two girls bartending seemed to have left but the late night bartender, the gentleman with longer hair in a pony tail, the same guy that cashed me out when I was gaming was busy at the bar dealing with other guests.  We completely understood as we are in the service industry.  about 15 min. later we finally got his attention and received our bill, it was a little high so I asked to see the print out.  The drink that I had while gaming prior to my friends arriving was still on the bill.  I explained to him calmly that I was gaming over $20 max bet and it should be a comp.  He argued then got quite loud so other guests heard him and turned towards us, telling me that I should take it up with the girls that were at the bar before him.  He said he did not see me put $20 in the machine and could not do anything about the comp.  I explained to him that he had cashed me out and he witnessed me leave a good tip.  He said there was nothing he could do.  At the end of the day, you have to take care of your guests.  I gamed and still was not taken care of, my party was ignored, not even acknowledged and not treated as if you need our business.  I will not be returning to this Pt's location and I will take my gaming and any business for that matter to other establishments, maybe I will find one that actually cares about their guests.  I hope you find this email informative and sort your problems out.  I will never do business with pt's or sierra gold ever again, end of story."}

{"text":"Who needs Starbucks?
I get great coffee and service daily here and it has become part of my work week writing.
Between the $2.50 coffee and a great view of planes landing, it's a great destination spot to start your day.
Also, from 6-10am, all breakfast is half off. 3 eggs, steak, toast and potatoes only $6. Steak is great quality and seasoned well. Might be best deal in town. 
Great AM service with smile, good coffee, great food prices. Check it out"}
{"text":"I got the most amazing service from a bartender named Molly and I wasn't even drinking booze on this day.

I was panicking at home at 9am Saturday morning when my internet crashed. I had a deadline, so I rushed to my favorite PTs in town for use of the Wi-Fi, even though Its much further than the four PT locations nearby home.

Much to my delight I got to meet Molly who got me a fresh cup of coffee and kept refilling it. Perhaps the best thing about her was the genuine smile that felt like it was saying \"I'm so glad you came by; thank you.\" 

Molly apparently is just naturally friendly, but the stress of my situation quickly evaporated with that smile and good nature. I got the job done well. PTs should bottle up what Molly has and make it part of initial training for all to follow. She's almost Muse-like, inspiring.

The reason I come to this location even though it's so far from home is because of routinely getting great service. I visit once in a while during the day and there is another great bartender named Carrie who is always so kind.

So thanks Molly, and thanks to Carrie. You both got it down and I'll continue to visit no matter how far I live. Great service creates loyalty. The coffee was good as well, but that is so secondary in this situation."}
{"text":"horrible .....

went at 4am...3 bartenders and they couldnt handle 30 people in the bar...at times waited 10-15 min for a beer..

drink prices outrageous...felt like i was on the strip.. also pt's adds tax to cost of drink instead of being included in price...
large draft $11..???!!!! 

i havent been to a pt's in over a year and now i remember why.....
corporate attitude ruins what used to be a great bar for industry get togethers after work...."}
{"text":"Will never return. Sat and played video poker for a couple hours, had a few drinks but the bartender is a dumb ass.  Was over charged and he didn't know how to comp drinks for gamblers.  Also, the bathroom in this place is disgusting.  I would rather go in a porta-potty.   Then when I went to leave, the bartender chased after me with another bill that he thought was mine.  It obviously wasn't because I had already paid mine.  What a garbage establishment that used to be a popular place to have a drink.  Really went down hill."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new PT's in the area.  We have come here several times since opening and keep coming back for their awesome customer service, drinks flow, machine payouts and food.  Ashley is a big reason to keep coming back.  Something about feeling special every time you walk in the door is enough even if the food is bad.  Thankfully its ALL good.  We've only been here for breakfast time however I see us visiting any time of day."}
{"text":"Love love love the wings at PT's!  This was the first PT's I went to in Vegas and is a cool lil spot.  I've been to others since bit this one is pretty clean and newer looking compared to others.  The cons though are that it didn't feel very nostalgic like some of the others and the glasses my beer was in wasn't very cold.  All in all its pretty mediocre but not bad to kill some time or watch a game."}
{"text":"I love the environment and the people that work there are great. They remembered me after 1 time"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast there today about 10:00am. The waitress, Dawn, is a sweetheart. Helpful, friendly, and a nice lady. The food was delicious! Potatoes with onion cooked in and seasoned right! Yum. Bacon was tasty and crisp, not fatty or thin. The sausage patty wasn't fat and greasy it was delish.The scrambled eggs were good, iced tea was freshly made. I was there 2 1/2 hours waiting on my car to be fixed across the street. The tea was refreshed, I was checked on just enough. I signed up for their card because I like the atmosphere here. Bathroom was clean, tables, floor etc. The only negative was music a little loud, but that's everywhere now.
Thank you!!"}
{"text":"this location could and should be much busier than it is. it's severely understaffed, and that's putting it pretty mildly. I came in at 2am on Thursday morning to order food to go and there's maybe 30-50 people in here. it took longer to get my order taken than it took to get the food. there is one bartender, Mark who doesn't really have a dedicated bar back (the person ducking out to help him is clearly from the kitchen, which is fine,  but he shouldn't have to...there should either be a dedicated bar back or another bartender-even a server!) and is having to not only serve his bar area, but also the tables. this place is way too big to be doing that with so many people here. the bartender is out numbered by frustrated, rude patrons...myself included unfortunately. it's not his fault and he's truly doing the best he can with what's available to him, he's the only reason I'm giving this location 3 stars instead of one or two. also, remember it's not your bartenders fault his/her boss is a dick and doesn't staff him/her with the appropriate help they need-they're working their asses off...DON'T STIFF THEM ON A TIP, YOU JERK. that's the main source of their income-remember their making a \"tipping hour wage\". thanks Mark, sorry for being annoyed-you're a rockstar and I'm just a hangry you know what"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to our nearby bar but it was packed due to the Golden Knights game. We decided to check out this PTs. We were impressed how clean it was and the plus side, there were only about 20 people there. It was great. We got a chance to sit somewhere comfortably which I may add this place has a lot of great seating. I was very impressed with the food as well. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I know it's brand new, but I'm excited about this place. Clean, great location with awesome people all over the place. I've only been a few times, and all late night, but the girls there during happy hour and the guy on grave have all  been super friendly, and fun to hang with. I expect this to be one of my new favorite bars."}

{"text":"Amazing food. I'm a big gambler and frankly don't win much but the staff keeps me coming back. Cesar, Robin, Kerry, Jonny, and Josh are always delightful. Thank your staff for being amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst PT's I have ever been to. The staff is very rude and disrespectful. They don't want you to come in and they especially don't want you to order food. The bar tender Mike who works at night is flat out rude. His attitude sucks and he will make you never want to step foot in this location ever again. He would rather sit at the bar on his phone then wait on paying customers. I had to wait 10 minutes for him to even acknowledge I was in the place. There were only 3 other people there at 2AM. He just sat at the bar playing on his phone. Unbelievable. Don't wast your time. There is an awesome Sierra Gold right down the street who would be happy to have your business."}
{"text":"Very modern design and excellent location. I've lived in the NW for 5 years now and I'm happy to see that PTs is branching out to this area. I came in, sat down at a machine, put a $20 in and one of the bartenders told me I would have to spend pretty much all of my twenty just to get a comp beer. I'm not sure why he assumed I wanted a comp but that's the reason for my OK review. Most PTs aren't really picky about comps, if your gambling, but this one seems to be one of the few that is. No need to reply or comment about the \"comp rules\" I know how they work."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. They don't pay attention to their gamers at all. Ordered a drink and played for 30 minutes and no one acknowledged or asked to take my order. Bar is set up very nice and the decor is cool and the seats are very comfortable. But again, the service is horrendous"}
{"text":"the worst service ive ever seen! it seems they dont like tourist in there!! i was meeting with my friends there and bartender was really rude! my drivers license didnt work for her! ive been using it in every casino, bar, etc but pt's bartender seems to be soo special it wasnt good for her. she ruin our night"}
{"text":"Normally I don't review chains. Chains are what they are and you know this going in. For example, you go into PT's, you know you're going to get decent food, decent drinks, and at a decent price. You know they're open 24 hours, which is their selling point, and they're all over. So if all of them are the same, it really boils down to their service that determines if they live or die.

This PT's just flatlined.

We came in, were greeted fairly quickly, got our drinks (we didn't have alcohol, we were both a little on the tired side), and placed our orders. Maybe it was because we didn't have alcohol, but the food took a bit of time to come out. Not a HUGE deal.

So my friend and I are talking the soap opera of my life, when we realize we've demolished most of the pizza and our drinks haven't been refilled. The guy hasn't even come by. So we try to flag him down, and it literally takes 20 minutes to get some refills. Annoyed, we wait for the check. After 30 minutes, he finally notices us... then it takes another 15 to get the bill. I wanted to walk out... that kind of wait time is totally unacceptable. Sorry I wasn't boozing it up for once. Sorry I didn't have big ol' tits like the tarts at the bar. But I'm still a paying customer and demand a modicum of respect.

I'm pretty easy to please and hard to piss off, but this gone and done it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and we were the only table in there but the service was subpar. They have one server who takes care of the bar and the restaurant so she's just not available. We ordered a French dip which was dry and we ordered a cheese pizza, chicken fingers and fries. Our table had one soda. When the bill came it was $60 I checked out the bill and the pizza was priced at $18. Granted I should have looked but when my daughter ordered the pizza I had a general idea based on industry standards what the price would be..... and $18 wasn't even in the ballpark so I was shocked. This pizza was just a very thin pizza on what looked to be some kind of Frozen flatbread crust it was nothing fancy at all. When the server came I asked her if that was a mistake or was that the price and she said \" yeah it's a Red's pizza so that's how much it costs\" I don't mind paying good money for good food and good service but we got neither one of these
 things at this location. We will never be returning and that's unfortunate because we're a neighborhood customer this is just down the street from our house."}
{"text":"I have been coming into this PT's once a week for years on graveyard, mostly during mid-week nights. I bring my laptop to the bar to get work done to meet morning deadlines. The service is always great. I typically arrive just before midnight to hit up the half-price happy hour. I've visited most of the bars in the neighborhood and this PT's is the best one."}
{"text":"Today I had chicken wings pork sliders pretzel bites chicken fingers all good one of the best local bars. Food is always consistent"}
{"text":"Service started out slow and the place isn't busy.  I haven't been here in a couple years because it was always so packed you couldn't get a seat at the bar.  Got a beer and ordered food after being ignored for a bit .  Sliders and fries, mediocre are best.  Had a 2nd beer which has now been empty for 15 mins.  Asked for the check as the bartender walked by, I did receive the check but have been waiting nearly 20 mins for the bartender to come back and take my credit card to run it.  Born and Raised across the street is much better and friendlier.  5 mins later, still waiting and only 2 other people at the bar. Another 5 minutes has gone by and finally get the bartenders attention."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short and simple. PT's is the best hangout spot for HAPPY HOUR and to watch SPORTS in Las Vegas hands down. 50% off all drinks & pizzas!? Oh yeeaa. Its everyday from 4pm-7pm & 12am-3am. Heads up tho, you need a \"Beer & Bites\" players card to get the HH.  Its free to sign up! Plus it includes Sierra Gold too. 

This particular location is one of my top favorites I always go to. Not only is it newer than others, but its a lot bigger, very nice lounge area with pool tables, a separate dining area (aside from the bar),  very nice outdoor patio area with TV's so you can hang out outside when the perfect weather comes around, and oh cute (girl) bartenders for you single guys!  ha ha. 

See you at PT's Yelp Heads!"}
{"text":"Just visited this location for breakfast. It was quiet and for the most part empty. The customer service here is atrocious. My family and I received minimal acknowledgment after ordering our food and drinks. On top of that, we waited over an hour for eggs and hash browns. Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous and completely unacceptable. It was taking so long we had to notify the waitress and let her know we were no longer interested in waiting for our food. Definitely a terrible first impression and at this point I have no interest in returning to this location."}
{"text":"Inexpensive drink and great location never to busy and their food is pretty good for this PTs"}

{"text":"I love this place. Been waiting months for it to open. Every single server has been off the charts, especially Rick. Twice now, Victoria has said fewer than 3 words to us, looked at our empty drinks for 30 minuets, and gave us that \"you're not good enough\" vibe. Comp'd nothing after a fair amount into the machine. We'll come back, just gotta choose your nights unfortunately."}
{"text":"love the place...ashley was awesome....love that girl....she took care of me...she was fast and friendly...i recommend this place to everyone..."}
{"text":"We live in mountains Edge so this new location is pretty close. I give 2 stars because every time we have been there (5x now) the bartenders are soo moody, u never know what you're gonna get! We gamble a good amount of money and still get a tab for $60. We are locals, support all local bars and restaurants..but here is a joke. I hate to review poorly but I also hate leaving a place feeling the way we have on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place no star, i was discriminated because i didnt have a local i.d should i sue, this is the second time a pt's does this to me. She said she couldnt have me in here because i was mexican and had a mexican i.d. it was a blonde that work on monday 530am."}

{"text":"Had a Reuben sandwich today and a couple hours later had slight food poisoning.  It was the only thing I had ate all day, and diarrhea hit me 2-3 hours afterwards.  Must have been spoiled pastrami.  I will not eat there again. Damn shame, I liked their Gilroy pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. The bartender is a complete asshole. Always on his phone or spending time with his friends and customers literally have to yell at him to get anything. Lost a ton of money last night and he tried to sneak beers on my tab. Cesar is a complete jerk and thinks he owns the place. I have no clue how he's still there. He was cursing at one customer and then way over served another to the point he had to be dragged out of the bar. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The food is great!  But not cheap!  During happy hour the beer is a great price.  We have been going for years to this location and have not seen much turn over.  We do miss Sue!  She was a server there for a long time.  The rest of the bunch is good also tho."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for some wings and 3 beers. My bill was 50 bucks. When i asked for an itemized reciept, she avoided me for a while and when she saw that I was not gonna leave, she came back and said she made a mistake. Meanwhile all the waitresses did was complain about what they are making and how slow it was. It was obvious to me that she was trying to over charge me! Now she is telling the new shift girl to give me a free drink. It is safe to assume that these bartenders tend to over charge people to make extra cash. I will never come back here!"}
{"text":"Good corner bar.  Bartenders are super attentive and take care of you.  Didn't see to much service to the dining area but not the type of place I would expect to.  Beer is ice cold, and the cocktails are made the right way.  Ventilation system is pretty good.  You don't get hit with smoke as you walk in which is nice.  Food is typical bar food.  Wings are tasty and burgers are popular.

Happy hour is where it is at with 50% off drinks."}
{"text":"Don't go on a Friday before midnight because the female bartender is horrible! She spends most of her time with her back to the customers. When you do get her attention, she acts as if she is doing you a favor. She looks as if she had had a few years in the business and is jaded. She is not attentive. She really should not be a bartender...especially on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Whatever you order comes with a generous side of second hand smoke.

Totally reminded me of a scene from one of those 70s movies.  

I can't remember what I ordered, but it wouldn't have mattered because it tasted like cigarettes.

As a parting gift, you get spritz with eau de tobacco so your hair and clothes will remind you of your dining experience.

WTF"}
{"text":"Terrible!
I used to enjoy coming to PTs, but something  is going wrong, poor service, food was terrible and took forever, over 40 minutes to receive breakfast. I'm done with PTs"}
{"text":"I am not a complainer by nature, but after my experience this evening, I may never return to this bar. 

We had friends from another side of town come visit this bar because they have never done karaoke (Saturdays 11pm-2am) and this is usually a great place to do it. At around 11:30pm, we submit songs and order drinks. The bartending staff was a nightmare! Especially the red headed female that was working that night. She is by far the worst bartender I have ever dealt with. Perhaps, she was having a bad evening, but that does not excuse her eye rolling and laziness. It is because of her, that I will never return to this establishment.

Also, as far as karaoke goes, do not waste your time. While the DJ seems like a nice guy, he parades his buddies on the stage like it's some heavy metal sleepover. Very freighting to witness.

This bar is a last resort. Do not waste your time or money unless you are absolutely bored and have no other options."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Came in here for happy hour - ordered well's on the rocks. Came to find when we got the bill that they charge an extra $1.50 when you have a drink on the rocks (post happy hour discount). I suppose that would mean an extra $3.00 a drink in regular prices when you have your drink on ice instead of with soda. Who knew it costs an extra $3.00 when you ask them not to add something to your drink? 

Complained to the lovely bartender who looked at us like we were crazy and that every bar tacks these prices on. I guess they rely on brand new 21 one year old's who have never actually been to a bar before. Especially great since they never mention these additions before they give you the bill. 

Note to everyone - stay away, much better places to drink in Las Vegas that won't sour your experiences in the city. Note to owner - If this isn't your policy and you just have a horrific bartender - get rid of her ASAP. Never coming back, never recommending anyone to come here. Bye."}
{"text":"Ordered Nachos and asked for No Chili,  and I got Chili.  I guess they just order what they want to order here,  bartender, she should work at Mc Donalds."}
{"text":"DO NOT GAMBLE HERE.
40 bucks in the poker machine lasted about 5 minutes....I might as well flush money down the toilet."}
{"text":"lame place. bartenders are terrible, bad service and not very accommodating. stay away, food is waaaayyyy over priced."}
{"text":"This PT's location sucks.  Unfortunate because it's so close to home. The environment sucks. It doesn't have a good bar feel. The lights are too bright. It's really small. The bartenders are mediocre. I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Some bartenders are charismatic attentive, and make you feel welcone.  Others; like Wednesday's; at least tonite; are not. Horrible service and no attention, even when gaming at \"PT standards\" (i.e full hands continuous play). Last time."}
{"text":"I show up around 345 pm on a Thursday. Guy bartender was great. He was cracking jokes and having fun with us. I gambled for awhile, we ate and went to play pool. Waitress was super attentative to us and the other people playing pool. I'm cashing out because we are ready to leave. I ask for a bottled water and the blonde female bartender wants to charge me. I say \"Oh you're going to charge me...\" she said yeah. I tell her just give me a cup of water to go then. Her comment was \"Where do they give free water.\" I wanted to give her a comment but she gave me the dirtiest look for asking for a cup of water to go. If i could give 1/2 a star I would. All it takes is 1 horrible employee to ruin the night."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. We sat at the bar. There were 4 people working behind the bar yet I never got waited on. After saying \"excuse me, could I please get a drink?\" the bartender came and was polite and friendly. We wanted to order food but again had to yell to get a bartenders attention. They tend to gather around the register and chat with each other. We finally ordered the potstickers and quesedilla. The food was not bad but nothing special. Right as we were getting ready to leave, a bartender (Don) came by and asked how things were. Nice guy. We will prob go back to FireRock or Distill for happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in for food and a beer sat at the bar waited and waited, bartender long bright red hair served 2 guys next me then the guy on the other side of me ignored me, as I was leaving I told her it would have been nice to have a beer she just laughed!! This bar has gone to he'll since it opened."}
{"text":"Short happy hour but 1/2 off drinks is a steal! The pizza is delicious! Love the ham & pineapple! TJ is a great waitress & handles a big group with ease. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My friends and I use to love this PT's Kady was our favorite waitress we always called to see if she was in ,that's how awesome she was :) but she is not there anymore , just this past Friday we went to have a few drinks for my husban's bday when we first got there the first bar tender was on point he was really friendly I believe his name was Sean , after we moved to the pool table area to play we didn't get no service , when one of my friends asked why hasn't anyone come and take our order the waitress was rude saying if you have a tab in the bar you have to come here and order and get your stuff .there was a really loud and annoying couples on the other table and they were getting serve the entire night waitress was even having long conversation with them we decided not to let it ruin our night but at the end we all wanted to take shots for the bday boy as one of my cousins asked for them the bartender that was there at that time said \" I don't have time , why don't you look it up and tell me what's in that shot \" we all looked at each other saying \"did that just happened\" so yeah it was a horrible night with really bad service and we will never stop at that PT's ever again unless Kady came back ;P"}
{"text":"Gets 3 stars based on the value and quality of the lunch menu.

This PTs Gold, although very nicely designed, never seems to have that neighborhood bar feel that you want to go back to.  Always a little too dark and quiet.  Not sure if the bartenders there are brand new to the business, or just not that interested in building a customer base.  Not unfriendly, but somewhat uninterested."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the best PT's in town!  Great open feel, never smoky, nice patio, separate restaurant for under 21s, and the coolest bartenders.

Food is always good and beers are always cold!"}
{"text":"Really nice facility, great food, friendly staff & happy hour is a steal!!!! I'm glad this is down the street now!"}
{"text":"Decent sports bar. We sat at the bar and the only complaint with that is the people smoking at the poker machines.  It's only really a problem though if you are sitting right next to them because the bar isn't smokey at all.  The bartender was friendly and the food was great.  The wings are some of the best I've had.  The bar is surrounded by flatscreens with all the games on, the atmosphere is laid back and quite, and the theme is nice.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Dang it.... I really wanted to love this place and more importantly I wanted my husband to love it...  I am a gamer, and he is not, so any place we go that he likes makes it much easier on me.  We went at happy hour for drinks and to order dinner while sitting at the bar.  When we first came in, it was all good..  HELLO!  WELCOME!! they shouted, so far so good.  We sat at the bar, I was at a machine and my husband at a bar spot with no machine, next to me.  We ordered drinks which came quickly, but then nothing....  it was not super busy, Sunday evening at 5pm, no huge crowds.   But it took us a while to get our bartenders attention to ask for a menu.   This would not have been terrible if she had not been treating the single guys around us differently...  what is your name? etc...  I joked to my husband 'she didn't ask our names!'  hahaha...  She obviously doesn't know we are very good tippers for good service.  
My husband after leaving said he felt like there were two levels of service and we had been on the short end of the stick.  If you are a single guy, this may be a good place, but do not bring your wife or girlfriend is what he said  'Why should our level of service go down because we came in as a couple'.   
When we were finished I had lost $100 in my machine yet nothing was comped...  not even my cheap drinks (2).   We had to ask about it, annoying.  We usually go to Sierra Gold down the street where the service has always been top notch, so I guess we will continue to visit that side of the PT family.

If you are a dude going by yourself or with other dudes this is your place. Your welcome!!"}
{"text":"I thought my friend told me to try this.. turns out i was wrong.. it was some other place. However, I hit it up for lunch yesterday. Salmon Salad.. Pretty good I like the salad and it was really big. I shared it with my girl and then I got the Philly. Whoa.. this is where the train left the tracks.. it was oh so crappy. I know for they have never been back east and ate even an airport Philly because this thing sucked. In fact it was a roast beef sandwich with nacho cheese on it. I am not kidding.. it is.. In fact I was temped to get some some Auju and make it a french dip. I would have been a good french dip.. but a terrible philly."}
{"text":"First time coming here and our experience was very enjoyable once we got serviced. At first we walked in and decided to sit at a booth the waitress must have seen us about 3 times never came and greeted us or gave us the heads up that she would be with us shortly atleast. So my husband and I decided to sit at the bar and sure enough the Bartender was so courteous and attentive and with a great energy. As far as the waitress she was right next to us and again didn't even bother to even hand us a menu. I wish I knew her name because service like that makes people feel they shouldn't come again. She was black and had medium length black/brown hair. If a manager see's this maybe she needs a little bit of coaching on customer service. Anyway the food was AMAZING we had the nachos for starters and wings for our main dish and it was delish! The bartenders and guy waiters were phenomenal and so nice! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Never again!!!!!! Worst service ever!!! Two chicken wraps and 4 shots.  $52.. not one comp! Then the bartender,  Robin,  spent more time talking with friends and texting. Had to cash out just to tab out!! 

Should have walked out!! 

No silverware,  condiments,  or refills on soda. 

Done with PTs.. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Service is usually good. Food doesn't take long. Drinks could be a little stronger..."}
{"text":"All I can see is WTF! Went for a late night drink and gambling with family. After spending $300+, my sister snapped fingers in a fun friendly manner to get the bartenders attention. He was joking with us all night prior to this incident. He proceeded to yell at my sister and tell her that no one should ever snap their f ing fingers at him. We thought he was joking because it was so out of context. When we realized he wasn't jokingly asked for the manager. She was very rude rolling your eyes saying that he would never do something like that unless he was joking. So we asked the bartender again if he was joking he said he was not joking and he was very offended. These people are ridiculous I spent hundreds of dollars only to be treated like crap. The female who said she was the manager acted like she was inconvenienced by customer concerns about being sworn at by an employee. There are hundreds of bars that are local to go to gamble have a few drinks and get treated well PTs is definitely not one of them"}
{"text":"I give a two. Simply because we've been here long enough to vouch that the other bartenders were pretty damn chill. I have to swallow my puke for using this card, but I bartend on the strip. I KNOW what busy is... So when I want to get away from all that bs chaos? I go to my local bar. To chill. I don't go there to act up like, \"woo!!! We in vegas! Lets get turnt up!\" No. 

How ever, the experience this time around was just so degrading and cringe worthy... you made our local bartenders look bad bro. Mark, i hope you open your eyes and realize, if its not for your local goers that help bring you the income that you so desire? This is not the industry for you. Don't get mad at us or others if they don't tip you well(or nothing at all) if all you simply DID WAS NOTHING. Literally nothing but poured us the beers we requested and walked away faster then the speed of lightning. I don't expect you to sit there and sugar coat it up with us, but not one, \"sup guys, what can I get for ya?\" \"Hows your night going gang?\" None of that... My friends and I walked in, sat ourselves down, conversed for a minute and finally realized , \"yo, wheres the bartender?\" Eventually he appears, and goes... \"what do you guys want to drink?\" Granted, we were a little indecisive with what we wanted at the beginning, but it was one of those nights where the dude didn't even have the patience to listen to our request. He would seriously walk up to us, ask us what we wanted and as soon as we would reply? He's already semi-walking away, and by the time he had poured two of our beers, he'd come back frustrated because we were STILL trying to request a few more beers... I mean, had you stood there for a quick 20 seconds you would've heard us the first time and go on living your life... plain and simple. Dude, You were literally standing with your homie chatting for a good minute, so I don't think a minute or two with us would've made you die. I don't like to sugar coat things and I am not about to start... Had we have been one of those needy customers? I'd get it, but we literally ordered a tab that totaled to barely 60 dollars... couldn't have been that insane for ya mate. Anyways, have a better shift, and take this as an advice... length of time in the industry does not define how you can choose to behave in the industry... people rely on you to make their nights go by as smooth as possible. I deal with rude ass people all day, and when i go to chill? I don't need another brother being short and rude with me for no damn reason. Place my order, converse or don't, but don't give us an attitude like we came in and messed up your shift like those slobbering 21 year olds who kept requesting, \"make me your favorite, tropical, but not too sour, or sweet cheap birthday cocktail...\""}
{"text":"Inviting atmosphere, friendly service and great food and drinks makes this place a triple threat for a good time. No matter if you sit at the bar or a table the staff treats you like family. This place is a great place to hang out by yourself or with others. Stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"My family and I got seated 10 minutes to 5pm.  I ordered a beer and then the waitress (Amaya) came back to the table and told us it was happy hour at 5PM. At that point I told her to hold off on my beer, which wasn't brought to the table yet, and she refused to cancel the order.  She then brought the beer and had a horrible attitude. She was rude and gave us dirty glares and no smile. We asked for our check at that point, as we no longer wanted to eat dinner as planned.  She dropped the check off with a bad attitude and wouldn't say a word to us. We spend money at PT's very often and have NEVER had service like this before.  AMAYA SHOULD NO LONGER BE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY. She was very immature and bitter."}
{"text":"Nice and clean but the service was trash and it wasn't even busy. Don't know that I would come back to this location but if I do I hope there is different staff!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service & the food is really not bad for a bar.  I got an omelet with mushrooms, peppers & cheese.  The omelet was not over cooked, not greasy & tasted fresh.  The hone style fries were weird..cut into slices like scalloped potatoes. I didn't care for them.  Coffee was fresh & easy on the stomach.  Best prices on the weekend breakfast- half price."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour tonight and it was fantastic! The food was tasty, drinks were good, and our server, Brandon was A-MAZING! He was quick and sharp and a personality that is unheard of in food/customer service!!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty good special for half off drinks and pizza from 12am - 3am and 4pm-7pm. Got me a pear cider. Cold. Just the way I like it. This one has a sort of weird vibe, i like the Gold one a little down the road off of silverado across the street from the Fresh and Easy."}
{"text":"I went to the new PTs down the street from my house and I was amazed! The place looks great on the inside and out.  The food was awesome the beer was cold and service was outstanding.  Brittany was extremely nice, accommodating and a wonderful bartender! This place is truly Top Notch!"}
{"text":"Sheeri is truly the best server, and of course you can't beat the happy hour. This is my fave PT's"}
{"text":"So just went to pts tonight. We were there a total of an hour and half we weren't there to drink. Probably where we made our first mistake. For 45 mins we waited for our food. Granted we asked for extra time to order but still 45 minutes & I'm not exaggerating this. We order an appetizer of \"mozzarella sticks\"! Defiantly not mozzarella sticks more like triangles with more batter and oil than cheese!!! So gross! Then we order some nacho fries , chicken fried sandwich with no mayo and jalapeño sliders with no bacon . Well 45 minutes when we get our food it was cold as if it was waiting to be run forever. Makes sense since she disappeared. Then secondly the sliders with no bacon came with bacon and the chicken fried sandwich with no mayo had mayo on it! Talk about a server who can't listen and a cook who can't read a ticket! The server was 40% of the problem ... Every time I needed something she was no where to be found. The food wasn't even that good. The true definition of bar food! Stick to the chicken here and just drinks !"}
{"text":"The service is not great. My husband, friend and I were at the bar gambling and couldn't get a beer if our lives depended on it. The bar only 3 other people sitting at the bar with us. I had to cash out and buy a beer."}
{"text":"One of those places that I could visit a lot more than I do but don't.  

-The booze is expensive unless it's happy hour and you need a PT's card to get the discount. I can go across the street and get a six pack for what two beers would normally cost and drink in my closet

-The food is expensive.  During Happy Hour only the pizza is discounted and you need the card to get the discount.

-They removed the glass and the smoke free dining area is gone.

But if your going to meet some friends for a few drink and after four 25 ounce beers all the above stuff really doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different PT's. This is a nice location, but I'm not impressed by the service. The waitress was very slow. We came in the morning, there were maybe 2 other guests she had to wait on. Once she took our order she then asked if we wanted an extra side of bacon or sausage.... No, no I do not want an extra side of meat lady. If I did I would have told you!!"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware: Came here to watch football and get 1/2 off breakfast. Happy hour ends at 10am. We placed our breakfast order before 10. After the game we got our bill and were shocked. The waitress refused to give us happy hour prices because she supposedly didn't submit it to the kitchen before 10. That's not our fault she didn't submit them on time. She should have at least informed us. My receipt says 9:58am. I think it was a scam to make more money off us."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out after sitting at the bar and being ignored for about 10 to 15 minutes. Not that busy. Bartender walked right by us twice, even refilling drinks to other people. Won't be back. Charlie's down under way better staff and personable. Only got acknowledged when we got up to leave."}
{"text":"Great service. Good bar food. Interesting \"regulars\"...liked the fact that there was pool tables."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday to watch the Packers game and I would say we didn't have the best service.  The bar was fairly empty but there was just the bartender and cook on staff.  She was overwhelmed trying to get drinks, food, and get the TVs set up with the right games.  

First of all, the only \"paying customers\" that were in there wanted to watch the Packer game and asked for the sound to be turned on.  I was told that the Regional Manager was coming in and requested a different game (Bills/Jets maybe?) to be played.  Since when don't you follow what your paying customers are requesting?  I had about half a mind to march over to that manager and tell him that his customer service skills suck but I didn't want to get in a fight or make a scene.  

The bloodies were not good, just tasted like tomato juice and bad vodka.  At least the food was cheap and the beers were cheap, it was a nice change from the Vegas Strip.  We left at halftime."}
{"text":"Marginal pub food. Philly cheese steak with cheese sauce oozed from a gallon jug = yuk!  Taco salad was horrible. 

Service was good (and the only reason for 2 stars), but the food quality was poor. 

Looks like a fine drinking establishment, just eat before you come."}
{"text":"I come into this bar all the time. Not for the food or gaming, but because of the bartender. James makes the atmosphere! He's always quick to get your drink started and takes pride in what he does. He treats everyone equally and is definitely entertaining."}
{"text":"Went in tonight at 7pm, sat ourselves (party of two), and waited. And waited. There were two waitresses who literally stood at the bar for the ten minutes that we sat. Not a single employee acknowledged us, though we tried to catch someone's attention, and because we had hoped for some dinner/bar food and a beer or two and were hungry, we decided not to wait another ten minutes and left. We live two minutes up the street and were excited to have a new bar close by, but we won't be back. (And as a sidenote, for such a new, \"hip\" place the giant pictures of half-naked women on the walls was a little strange.)"}
{"text":"The male bartender with glasses and of the caucasian decent made me feel very unwelcome tonight. From the start, he was cold and had a bad attitude. It was a busy night and I understand this can be overwhelming, but If you work in the service industry, you should learn to smile and be friendly to guests no matter what the situation is. Your bad attitude can turn off potential local return clients. I was so flustered by the way you spoke to us that I did not even feel like ordering anything or leaving you any tip. We ended up relocating from the bar area and finished our night at a table where Christina, who was absolutely lovely, turned our night around with her attentive and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch a game
Nothing to complain about from me... White pizza is one of the best out here and the service commendable ... Don't mind the prices , but hit up the happy hour and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Christian is the best bartender!"}
{"text":"Come here on sundays, Ashley and her partner are great. Good place to watch the game have decent food and not have to worry about getting shit service like the rest of the places around here. Bartenders are on top of there game. Will be back"}
{"text":"Wasn't busy, but the service was horrible!! The beer was obviously bottom of the keg! So sad! Our beer mugs were empty and our waitress ignored them! So we had to go to the bar for more beer! On a sad note the bartender did not know how to poor beer too much head! Halfway down the glass! Ridiculous! On a happy note wings and zookie were delicious! Just wish the service was better!!!"}
{"text":"Went in with my sister, waited for 30 minutes to be waited on. No server came. Finally saw the waitress but she ignored us and just ate her nachos. WTF? PT's never ceases to amaze me. Always bad service. End up walking out. Corporate needs to retrain staff on customer service. SMH!"}
{"text":"Went in for half price breakfast during happy hour this morning, which is between 6-10am. Wasn't expecting the deliciousness I was served. Coffee was fresh, food was cooked to perfection and looked fantastic. Service was on point. I'll definitely be going back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Nicole, the bartender/waitress, was super nice! I would request her if you go to this location! I sat in the back area past the bar and she was still able to be my waitress.

I ordered the Philly cheesesteak (with mushrooms and mayo)and it was pretty amazing! I ordered philly cheesesteaks all the time and this is one of my favorites.

After Nicole suggested trying their famous zookie, I gave in. She was right, it was delicious!!! A chocolate chip cookie in a small deep dish pan with ice cream on top."}
{"text":"First time here since they opened !! Very nice inside . The decor is awesome and you could not tell if anyone was smoking which is awesome if you are here to eat !

Kyle was our server and did an amazing job ! Very nice and attentive to our needs and always checked up on us ! 

We love the food at PT's especially the the Gilroy ( pizza ) ! It's very good , would recommend to anyone! The wings and tots are also very yummy although we did not have tots at this time !! 

Tried a few of their crafted beers and the Red was my favorite ! Very smooth and filling in a good way ! 

Not very busy but would come back ! Always a little pricy on beers and pizza but overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food taste like a well cooked microwave dinner, I would have to be really stoned to come back again, meaning,  chances are ill be back sooner then u think."}
{"text":"My wife and I live right across the street and popped in about a month ago to have some drinks. Tiffany waited on us and I can honestly say we haven't had service like that in a long time. She is AWESOME! We now come to see her and love hanging out here as well. I definitely recommend coming in! Ask for Tiffany!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place didn't live up to the excitement I had for it to open. The decor is great, the drinks are great as always, but the food and service are far below average. The bartenders are not friendly and very unwelcoming. The pizza was no better than microwave ones, and it's unfortunate because they have a good location however Distill is right next door and we will continue to visit that establishment instead."}
{"text":"I got drinks here once and got decent service so I went back with my husband and it was horrible!!! We got a table and waited for a server to come.  That didn't happen, so we went to the bar to get our drinks and menus and they said someone would be by soon.  They weren't.  We flagged down someone else and they said the girl was training and she'd send her over.  Another 15 minutes goes by and she came over.  We ordered and then waited over 30 min for our food to come.  By then we got a to go box and went home.  It was our valentine's dinner and it was really disappointing. I wouldn't recommend the food either, the burger was burnt and tasteless!"}
{"text":"I've been to different PT's before and this one was really nice and dusted intimate. The staff was awesome and the food as well. I wish other PT's were the same. Plus list of parking and right off the freeway! Wish I lived closer to
this PT's"}
{"text":"Always a good place. The graveyard bartenders are always attentive, but not overly attentive to where it's bothersome. Their menu needs to be updated, changed or redone with better options."}
{"text":"After work happy hour - decent drink prices but very disappointed their happy hours have now changed to 5pm-7pm instead of 4pm-7pm."}
{"text":"Super close to my house and I enjoy the atmosphere but tte service is lacking !"}
{"text":"I love Pts, but this particular one is terrible. The staff here is uninviting and there service is terrible. You could have at least faked it."}
{"text":"Happy hour 5-7pm everyday, half off pizza and drinks. That's what lured us in to check out this new location. We frequent the Sierra Gold on Warm Springs for their late 12a-2a happy hour. Both locations share the same happy hours but this new location is closer so gave it a few weeks to open and work out kinks. I read other reviews about warm beer, they must have read them too because now they serve them in frozen mugs. Love it when it's icy cold! 
We looked at the menu and saw they do the same pizzas as Sierra Golds. Everybody knows the Gilroy is where it's at! It's full of toppings, from sausage to artichoke! It's amazing, I have introduced loads of friends to this pizza. At happy hour, half off, $10 price you can't beat it. So we were excited they do indeed serve pizza at the new location, some PT's don't. 
We went in Sunday at 5pm, the start of happy hour. It was maybe half full of customers, which were mainly at the bar. This location is just a bar, no pool tables. It's fairly small compared to other locations So we took a table, Katrina, our waitress, came fairly quickly with menus and took drink orders. As soon as she brought our drinks, we ordered the Gilroy pizza and a basket of mixed fries which are just $5 at happy hour and is a mix of tots, curly, sweet potato and regular fries. 
So I timed the pizza, it was out in 20 minutes. Which is not bad. She did forget to bring plates and was going to get some. We stopped her and said this was not a Gilroy. She said it's our version of the Gilroy. We said we get it at Sierra Golds all the time, she said yeah they still have the old menu. We were irritated beyond belief that she knew it was different and didn't speak up when ordered. I guess it was our fault for not reading all the ingredients, I saw white sauce and some of the ingredients but just a glance. Never would have thought a chain of pubs would serve food with the same name but completely different. Don't get me wrong the pizza was really good, but it was not a Gilroy. The crust was thin, crunchy and delicious! 
We ended up waiting for plates for so long we just used napkins as plates. Then we couldn't get refills. She finally brings plates and we said keep them and get us a box to go. 
I had my beer bites card that I had given her at the beginning she never swiped, and they were taking so long when we finally got the check I wanted her to swipe my club card and use debit but they were slow and we decided we would catch a movie if we left right then, I caved and didn't get my points and paid with cash. 
Seems like we won't be the only ones headed back to Sierra Golds. We'll try again when they get their act together."}
{"text":"I used to spend a lot of time here a few years ago drinking copious amounts of beer along with eating stacks of Gilroy pizzas. I stopped in to toast my dead cat before a haircut. Nicole the bartender is awesome. A bartender that introduces themselves should be standard in the trade. No longer a local it was somewhat comforting to be back. The swirling flame bar top still burns brightly."}
{"text":"45 freakin' minutes, sittin' at the bar, waiting for a burger & fries to go? WTF? They musta brought the cow in from Elko.

And don't think the kitchen was swamped either. During my wait I saw exactly two plates come out before mine: nachos & sliders. Yeah, those are pretty labor-intensive menu-items, right? 

This, with a full time cook in the back-of-house. Probably fresh off the fry baskets at McDonalds.

P.T.'s just bought the Stratosphere, btw. So be looking for the same level of service to appear there soon enough. 

(Actually, I briefly visited the Strat about three weeks ago. Their 24/7 Starbucks clipped me $11 for a bottle of water and a cookie. I guess the management team is smoking some now-legal weed that has led them to the delusion that typical Strat guests will line up to pay Bellagio prices without hesitation.) 

Grapevine has it that a Village Pub is opening soon ... just one block away from this P.T.'s. 

Patience, young grasshopper.

UPDATE [2018-04-25]: That new Village Pub just opened at Arroyo Grande & Warm Springs, little more than one long block from this hole. The food was prompt and excellent and reasonably priced, the service was fawning and the atmosphere was sedate & appealing."}
{"text":"We had a decent visit here for a lunch treat!   It was our first time visiting a PT's.  I have seen them all over the Vegas area but hadn't stopped in until now.   We bellied up to the bar instead of sitting at a table.  They weren't very busy but sitting there just seemed easier.  

The bartender was very pleasant!  She got us our drinks and took our order in no time.  I was in the nacho mood... again.  The husband was in a wings mood... again.  So nachos and wings it is...Again!  ha ha.    The nachos were a huge plated serving.  It was topped with chili, cheese, jalapeños, sour cream and guac.   Tasty!   The chili gave the nachos a wonderful flavor.  I wouldn't hesitate from ordering this again.

The wings?~ Well, my husband liked them.  Me? Not so much.    Their buffalo hot sauce didn't cut it for me.  The flavor was just blah.  It almost left a bad aftertaste that I couldn't shake.  Oh well.   I had chili cheese nachos to cover that!  

The place itself is really nice!  It's clean, up to date, lots of seating and a game room with two pool tables in the back.   It was a good first time visit for us.  I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I given this place more the a few try's, their service is slow/ sucks! The waitress are very stuck up and arrogant they expect you to know there happy hour specials (blond moment look when asked).  They do have their special customers they take care of first.  We had to waive are waitress down every time for service as she never came to check up on us.  After she took care of her peeps and we asked for the bill she tried to over charge us on drinks!  I kept tabs on it and made sure we didn't order after 7 Happy hour time.  But she insist we did and tried to charge us still!! She got an attitude with us snatch the bill back and took it off!  Well maybe next time she will take care of everyone and not her special people! And pay more attention!!! I left no tip and will not return back.  You need to change that stuck up attitude boss that walks around thinking she is super HOTT when it's all make up! And that ugly waitress with the moe on her lip!! I couldn't stop staring at that thing so gross!!"}
{"text":"I've been to lunch here once. The food was really good. (fried pickles were delicious but a tad greasy)  The service  was quick and the waitress as pretty funny and witty.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Can't beat breakfast on happy hour at pts. Get half priced platters.. we always get the pts platter and a drink. 2 of those and your meal is probably around $15 with tip, before 10 only though!"}
{"text":"Steak fries were actually disappointing...Presentation: served in a tub like KFC fast food. If I'm gonna pay $10 for fries, at least serve it on a plate! The bar counter top has a rusting-nickel smell...quite distracting.

But extra tip to the bartender for such attentive and friendly service. Great low key place to watch sports and also two pool tables in the back away from the seated area."}
{"text":"One of the nicer PT's I've been to! About a 30-40 minute drive from home, but we went because friends were watching the Super Bowl there! 
Plenty of TV monitors, at every angle, to watch at. Staff were friendly nice, attentive, and definitely enjoyed working there.

Drink and food prices were decent! Love their Happy Hour!

AND their Pizookie is AMAZING!

Definitely a cool place to hang out and drink at!"}
{"text":"Slow understaffed warm beer on Friday sat at a table for 30 minutes nothing hahababavsbsahhaahahahahahahagaagagagzgGagagHahahahahahahahhabahahaha"}
{"text":"I am beyond irritated and will not be returning to this bar. After an already hectic and awful experience at Hakkasan I decided I still wanted to celebrate the fact I have just obtained my cosmetology license so decided to hit a local bar near my house with a close friend of mine. Drinks were fine that is until we paid. The careless bartender gave my friends debit card to the wrong person!!!! Instantly my friend and I freaked out, I demanded he needed to do something asap because I didn't want him to lose his job but I was angry at what he had done. He got cocky with me said he would never lose his job and that this actually happens frequently!!!! Talk about careless. Do not go here unless you carry cash only unless you love going through the hassle of canceling your debit card because it's now in the hands of someone else. Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now."}
{"text":"I love it here. Ej is the best bartender by far. You could always have a great time here no matter what. They have a great menu. And a even better happy hour menu. The drinks are half off and they have plenty of machines to play on. I hit a lot of keno here so i definetly love this spot. Its also close to the freeway so its easy to get home after. Definetly a place you can have a party at."}
{"text":"They had recently opened this new location so of course we had to try it out.

It was lunch time so it was very easy to walk in and sit where we chose.  Bellying up to the bar, Elizabeth was tending.  She was a great bartender.    She was attentive and very friendly.  We were constantly checked on and made sure everything was to our liking.

We decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla as well as the Club Sandwich with onion rings.  The quesadilla was generously filled and served with salsa and sour cream. This appetizer could easily be shared between 2-3 people especially if you're ordering another item.  The club sandwich was your average club divided into 4 triangles.  The onion rings were piled in the center.  I was surprised at the amount given.  They were crispy and flavorful.  On a whim we ordered the macaroni wedges.  I wish we would've skipped those.  Kind of bland which is probably why it's served with a cup of ranch.  

I surely appreciated the great service.  For food it's an ok place to stop especially since they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch, or so I thought.   

You can easily spot PT's off of Eastern.  There is plenty of parking.  The place itself has much seating.  It was clean and not too smokey when we were there.  There were only a few other people dining there so I thought service would be quick.  

We started off with their pretzels bites served with cheese and honey mustard.   The pretzels were pretty decent but the cheese was not.  It was a watery cheese if you can imagine.  We then split the Big O Burger.  It's topped with bacon, cheese onion rings and sautéed onions.  This was good. It's really big enough for anyone to split and have enough to eat.  

My issue was the service and how long we had to wait for our food.  When there are only a few others in the place, it shouldn't take long to prepare what we ordered.  I would have no problem upping the star rating if the service was better.   

I'll keep hope for you PT's!"}
{"text":"I really like the location of this PT's. It has a certain charm to it being tucked in under a hill of the Black Mountain. The building looks very new and the interior is smaller, but modern and clean. When I arrived late afternoon on a Thursday there were only couple of other patrons there. The female bartender was very friendly and accommodating. She told me about their $2 Dos Equis special. I usually do a shot of whiskey and a beer if I am not in the mood for a cocktail. They didn't have Jim Beam's Devil's Cut so I settled on Jack Daniel's Honey. I also told her about the Yelp check in special that is good for one free domestic pint or a well drink. She was very excited that someone has finally claimed it. I opted for a whiskey sour and another beer. I asked her if she could change one of the TV channels to a news channel and she happily obliged. If she stayed, this review would have easily been four stars, but it was the end of her shift. A male and female bartender took over. Their focus became on the silver hairs that kept on trickling in -- the regulars I guess. I asked to look at the food menu, and everything was pretty pricey for bar food. The cheapest burger was ~$10... no thanks. I finished my drink and called it a day. The total was only $10.50 because they had good specials and my free check in drink. One star for the location since it is walking distance to the house and one star for the initial bartender. If you're not a regular expect to be ignored."}
{"text":"If you find yourself just wanting to get out on a cold night and not drink that night ,much anyways feel free to stop in with the most Offensively impolite lady staff (only bar \" I know of like this\") if spitting in a drink means they want to kiss you????????.. pass
My long story is short here.
Next........
P.S I'm only referring to this location, other locations Have great staff,"}
{"text":"This is the first and last time I come here. I've gone to dozens and dozens of bars and I have never had to pay for drinks until now. I always thought you play in the machines you get comped on drinks. I put in a couple of 20's and even bought nachos and my mom played in the machine as well, and still got charged for drinks. I asked the bartender why I wasn't  comped and she said because I wasn't playing max. I have never heard that BS before. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"The gilroy pizza is fricken-amazing. I love coming here with the hubby on dates. It's much nicer than your standard Pt's pub. The menu is bigger, the staff has always been super friendly and accommodating, and they've never run out of my favorite beers.
Bonus that it's within walking distance of my house. They have a card called beer n bites...you'll need it to participate in happy hour: 1/2 off all drinks and pizzas...times change,but right now it's everyday 3p-7p.

ps:last time i checked,seared ahi on the appetizers menu!!"}
{"text":"Went to the local PT's Gold a couple of days ago for beer and bites. Well, the beer was good anyway. My wife got nachos which were amongst the worst ever. The cheese was just the liquid variety poured all over, and a topping of what was supposed to be quacamole....not really so sure, but it was green anyway. Really terrible nachos. I don't know how the chains head chef does not realize this. The burger was passable to moderately good, however the fries with it were soggy grease bombs. All in all a weak experience.....but the beer was good!"}
{"text":"I had to hang out in the immediate area, after dropping the boy of at the airport.  Thought I would stop in and have a beer and watch some airplanes.  Normally, when you walk into a PT's your eyes go into overdrive trying to get use to the darkness.  I was surprised to see this particular location was well lit.  Spacious, bright and clean I enjoyed a cool frosty while watching planes land on 25 right and left.  The food and beer are... as every other PT's is in the valley is.  This one is A-OK given it great location."}
{"text":"This is a revision. I've been a regular at this PT'S for some time now. And unfortunately they've had some turn over in staff, but that's expected in the industry. The drinks, food, and service is awesome. They have a separate dining area, patio, and bar with pool tables. At the bar, Nettie is truly wonderful, and she makes you feel at home. She has great energy, and she always takes very good care of the customers. Cara is also a very friendly and very good bartender. If you're there late nights, Ray will take care of you. He's fast and super friendly. Look for Megan too, she is the best. She handles the dining area and she's awesome.Her service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Staff was overwhelmend on a friday after work and food took forever to come out! Will choice eleswhere in the future!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighbor spot for food or to meet up with friends!  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place just opened within walking distance from my house. I was really hoping that it was going to be good. Place is nice (of course they just opened) plenty of tv's and seating. But very disappointed there are NO POOL TABLES, no darts and not even a shuffle board. 
To top it off service is slow. We came in on a Sunday afternoon 10 people sitting in the bar area and it took us 10-15 minutes to get a drink. After we ordered a refill it took for the bartender to go around the bar and find other things to do before getting a vodka soda. I will give it another try in the future. Maybe it's just because there new."}
{"text":"I still frequent this bar. And I still love it. They changed GMs so it's no longer Kayla (who went to another pts and is still so amazing) to now Rian. He's just as great. I love the staff. The service. The ambience. Everything."}
{"text":"I love the familiarity of PTs, and the improvements on the old of each new branch. Decided to check out the newest one with a friend. Great place to watch a game (alas, it was the wee hours of the morning). Super big, super clear TV's at the bar. Biggest hit or miss in any PTs is the bartender. Another hit. Shannon was great. Attentive without being pesky. That is, when she saw that we wanted to talk to her she was warm and personable, but when we she came back to check on us and saw we were in deep conversation she just pointed at our drinks. A quick nod, and another round was on its way. Not the closest (or even top 20 closest) PTs to where I live, but will be back. Either for a game, or to see Shannon.

Oh, and as for food. Had the usual wings and Gilroy. No complaints."}
{"text":"Wow walked in sat down at a machine played for 15 minutes didn't get any service. Worse the bartenders were standing with thier backs to me and gossiping. Then in walks another person and hets waited on before she sat down. HORRIBLE SERVICE which indicates poor management. Will not be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here mostly for Beka the best bar tender of all time.  M-Thursday days.  She remembers my favorites...is on top of my drink orders....and I think she's a good luck charm.  I always win big time when she's on duty!! 

It's not smoky or crowded during the day and has a nice group of people. 

French toast is best in town...steak and eggs...a value at half price.  

Quite local place to hang out, have good food, meet nice people....and win some extra cash."}
{"text":"PT's was super accommodating for our large group of people, and the food I tried was tasty and was served quickly despite our crowd. Even with everyone milling around, there were attentive servers making sure we were taken care of, and the patio looked super comfortable (even though I hung out on the couches in the back)"}
{"text":"PT's is as good as it gets. The bartenders actually make a point of learning your name. They have an excellent knowledge of mixology and are very attentive. If you are looking for a place with diversity, they are it. All races, lifestyles and ages are welcome. They offer two excellent happy hours from 5 to 7PM and from midnight until 2AM every day. With that there is a special $5 menu and half price on many items on the regular menu including their pizza... which is very good I might add. With a large compliment of on-tap beers, a sports bar feel and gaming at the bar, it's the perfect local watering hole."}
{"text":"I thought you weren't allowed to smoke in bars and restaurants that served food? Unfortunately I have to get up and leave as there are 4 people smoking here where they serve food. Ugh."}
{"text":"First off it seems like they are always changing there staff when I come in. We try to get to know the bartender and stuff,but gets hard. Lol but I love Nina the waitress,she's the best. Unfortunately  she is leaving :(  I love the music they play here! Good happy hour too! Come by play some pool with your friends and drink a nice brew on tap!:)"}
{"text":"It's ok.  It's cleaner on the inside than some of the PT's I've been too. However a PT's is a PT's... The thing that differentiates them from each other and the reason for a 3-star rating is because of service. I would have given one star for this, but she was so nice and apologized for the inconvenience so she redeemed three stars. We got there around 8:30 p.m. and waited for someone to take our drink order until about 9:15. That is an absurd amount of time for a bar that is not that busy, has a wait staff, and a bartender. By wait staff I mean there was one waiter, taking drink orders to tables that were not right at the bar. So just to put it into perspective she did not even have to leave the bar to take our order or anyone else's, it's literally her only job to serve drinks and put in food, especially serve drinks to those just walking in. Plus there was no extenuating circumstances to cause such a delay. I made eyes at her look Restless pretty much did everything but Snap My Fingers, and she was just busy chit-chatting with people who already had full beers. I know she saw us,  but perhaps was too engaged in conversation to notice?  Perhaps they might be thirsty perhaps they might want to spend money on beer. I made sure just to get my one beer and leave. 45 minutes is not acceptable amount of time to wait to be served."}
{"text":"I used to go to this bar for a short while, before it was a PT's. It was always a nice bar. However, the service did not meet my expectations. 

I went there with my wife for our anniversary, to do a Pant Night... I was very impressed with the overall experience. 

The reason they received 4 out of 5 Stars, was the fact that it's very difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. 

The bar tenders were great! Quick to serve, friendly, and very efficient! I was very impressed that they remembered my name very quickly! 

The layout of the bar was very cool! It's an open floor plan, with an outdoor balcony, and private area!

The bar was also very clean in all areas! I was especially impressed with the bathrooms.

The food was uniform to any other PT's. We ordered the Pretzel Bites... The only difference I noticed, was that my regular PT's is better at presentation. 

I would definitely go to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Ashley and Claudia are always awesome! They are always friendly and smiling! The service you get here is the best, the food is amazing and they have 21 tv's. The best place to watch football!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot on Saturday 5/19/18 because I wanted to watch the Basketball Play-Offs.
I arrived about 5:50 P.M. The parking lot was pretty empty which I found odd. 
I went inside and sat at the bar. Their was maybe 7-8 people inside total.

I asked the bar-tender if he had any blended fruity drinks...he said NO. No blended drinks period. I was like...Hmmm..OK...It was still close to 95* outside so that would have hit the spot.

I ended up ordering a Mai Tai. I asked him for a food menu and I ordered a 1/2 lb Pub Burger (comes with fries) for $7.00 which is a 24 hour special they offer. 
Food was pretty good..Can't complain.

Happy Hour is from 5-7 P.M. & 12-2 A.M.
50% off drinks & Pizzas and have a select few appetizers that are $5.00.

Now...on to the basketball game situation. All I can say is WOWWWWW.
They have huge screens in the pool table area (NONE of them had the basketball game on)
They had 1 tiny lil tv screen at the bar with the game on (NO SOUND) 
Every single screen had the Hockey Game sound on. SMH.
No One was even watching them either. 
I will never try and go here to watch a basketball game again. Still can't believe it.
Drinks are weak as hell and served in a tiny lil glass...I ordered 1 more after I was done with my food...Then I left.
Bartender wasn't personable at all...and he had a dirty nasty band-aid on his fingertip area...That I couldn't help but notice as he grabbed fruit and limes etc. to make the drinks...Ewwww.

Maybe a good place to eat at Happy Hour or to play pool/darts with friends...But definitely not for Basketball."}
{"text":"Running errands late yesterday, and my guy and I were deciding on dinner. We had heard from friends of ours that PT's had happy hour from 5-7.

We walk in to a very busy, smokey bar. The dining room was \"seat yourself\".
Being the only ones in the dining area, we were acknowledged in a decent amount of time...

Before even ordering, our waitress immediately asked for both of our ID's. 
We asked if happy hour was only in the bar, and our waitress told us that the HH (happy hour) applies to the entire restaurant.  

I ordered a water, and my guy ordered a Stella beer, and a shot of Jack Daniels.

We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, and a bucket of chicken tenders with sweet potato fries. We originally couldn't agree on a fry selection, but when I asked if I could just get a side of fries, the waitress told me that they only do fries for the buckets.....so, sweet potato fries it is (for about $2 more).

I'm a little confused on their HH pricing though.
Our waitress told us that it was \"all half priced\", the sign on the outside of the building says half off on pizza and all drinks.

Our pizza arrives first, and it was very good. I was pretty surprised. The big hunks of cilantro really added a burst of freshness, that the pizza needed. The BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me. A few drops of hot sauce would have really added an extra POW.

The bucket of chicken tenders arrives next. The fries were delicious, almost melt in your mouth fantastic. They were so airy. The chicken tenders were a tad lack luster. The breading was tough, even after being coated in sauce. 

When I order tenders/wings, I'm expecting a hot sauce with some flavor... I want to taste some vinegar, some spices....not just heat. So, would I order these again..? Not really.

My guy asked for some extra celery, and our gal comes back with an entire plateful. While this was very thoughtful, I would have appreciated a hint drop of a charge of $3 for celery. 

So, our bill comes.
Shot of Jack $6.
Stella beer $7.50
BBQ pizza $9
Tender Bucket $$11.99
Side of celery $2.50
Carrots $.75

So, where's the HH pricing on our drinks...? Is it just me?
Because a $6 shot doesn't sound half off...unless they have \"strip\" pricing, and their shots are normally $12.... Same goes for the beer. Unless their normal pricing is $15 for a beer..... I don't see this being a decent HH.

Also, charging me for carrots....really? You're talking about the 2 or 3 carrots that were at the bottom of our chicken tender bucket..?

$40 before tip, not bad for a night out, but when we came for HH pricing, that's kind of high."}
{"text":"This is by FAR the best PT's in Las Vegas!!! 

I started going there occasionally, when it first opened. Made good money playing poker there. 

In my single years it was a nice quiet bar, with sports or good music, and a nice atmosphere, to take dates.

When I met my wife, her sister lived near by and we'd go there occasionally. We really didn't care for the staff at the time.

I've frequented almost every bar in this area. I felt like they only treat the regulars and and gamblers good... So for a while I had stopped going to any bars. When I did go out, I'd meet a buddy at this PT's. 

I started to really like the new staff. then started going more often.

The Bar Tenders Jen, and Rebecca are awesome! Chris the manager really impressed me, when he was at a ball game with his family, and saw me walking by, and took the time to stop and say \"Hi.\" Christina the waitress, is the best in town! 

I started meeting the regulars and they're all really good people. 

The food is great! I had breakfast there on Sunday... Fantastic! 

The Pool Tables are in mint condition! The Arcade Games like Golden Tee are always in great condition, they have the latest version immediately, and the screens are great quality.

I'm there at least 3 times a week! My favorite bar in Las Vegas. I recommend everyone in Las Vegas from Henderson to Centennial Hills, to visit this PT's!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders. Food is average at best. Cook is rarely there late night.  The comping  policy is not very good. Star and Charlie are wonderful. I like to have breakfast in to mornings. Not as busy."}
{"text":"A typical Pts. Good drinks. Inexpensive food. Bartenders are nice. Not great about comping."}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town and after having a few bad experiences we decided to try this bar. We have been three times and each time has been great! Good food, good people and the bartenders make a damn good bloody marry!"}
{"text":"The food was good service was friendly went around 8am wasn't overly smokey. The place was clean well lit and inviting unlike a lot of the 24/7 places in the same area. It's a great addition to the new build ups"}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL, this pub is not located as to where it's reported for the profile page. The pub is actually about 100 ft NORTH of the 215 freeway & Buffalo Drive exit. Therefore, right when you exit, you will need to head NORTH, not south. Otherwise, you'll be headed to nothing but vacant lands.

This is one of the very few PT's that displays the PPV events of UFC.

The layout is great. Newly renovated with lots of TVs so that it displays multiple sports showings. Even has a patio even though I don't really see anybody using it.

As any other pub, this particular joint has all the standard alcohol selection that you would find anywhere so there's nothing to really rave about when it comes to alcohol specialty. Maybe the way bartenders make their drinks but they're certified so just trust them!

The service is great even when busy. Enough bartenders and servers so that you won't feel neglected. I got some standard nachos and they were DELICIOUS! About 8.99 which is typical but nothing better to complement your alcohol than nachos and/or chicken."}
{"text":"It's PTs... If they screwed up, it just wouldn't be PTs.
Good set up with 4 separated areas: Dining, bar, lounge and pool tables."}
{"text":"It just opened two weeks ago near our neighborhood.  The wife and I decided to have Saturday morning breakfast.  Once we walked in we were welcomed by the staff with a good morning greeting.  The place was spotless.  Our waitress was DeAun, she was very friendly greeted us, told us of the breakfast specials, told us how to join their Reward Club called Beer & Bites, all types of ways to win money, prizes, drink and food specials.  WE ordered, the wife had a stack of pancakes and me, steak and eggs, the food arrived quickly, steak cooked to perfection and the pancakes were stacked high, pretty enough to take a picture and delicious, coffee was good and hot and we never worried about refills, DeAun made sure our cups were full. We loved the food.  DeAun the waitress was a hit with us, very friendly and personable.  She really was easy to chat with and she made it a point to get to know us, she answered any and all questions we had and during our stay we found out a little about her.
We will definitely be return customers, I'm a sports fan they have plenty of TV's add to that a friendly staff and good food and drinks plus it's less than 5 minutes from our residence.  PT's Gold is a hit."}
{"text":"Nicest PT's I've ever been too :) 
The inside & outside look really nice compared to other PT's I've been to around town. Great place to hang out with a group of friends without having to see all the weirdos and ratchets. 
Waitress was very nice & attentive even with other large groups in the bar. 
Sucks that they charge to play pool but I guess that's because it's one of the nicer PT's?"}
{"text":"A great place with good food, a wonderful staff and fun people.The kind of place you go \"where everybody knows your name!\". Just a good local place to go where you always feel welcome. Special kudos to Starr and Charlie but the rest of the staff is the best too! Try it."}
{"text":"So far the best Pts to go to. James is the night shift bartender and he is the best. The food is delicous, and fresh. Every chance  we get a chance after a long day of work this is our local bar to go to."}
{"text":"Best bartender hands down is Mark and Rey at pts! He's so fun and so cool and made our experience so fun! And he has some killer dance moves! Come see Mark and Rey and you won't regret it but you might regret the hangover"}
{"text":"The food is good! We had a really friendly bartender named Liz! She was really quick and made great drinks!! I love the fact that its down the street from my house $5 uber lol See you soon for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"This is a very convenient place to go they have a full bar as well as a full menu the workers are always great and provide great customer service you can also that with William Hill at this location as well."}
{"text":"We have been going to this PT's for years, love watching the planes and having drinks and food. Always reasonably priced. So imagine our surprise to see a limited smaller menu, higher prices. Icing on the cake, they charged 75 cents to add ONIONS on a cheesesteak sandwich!! Seriously!!  If you want a burger, you have to pay for anything \"extra\" 
So three sliders with onions rings were $12.50-Cheesesteak-$12.00.-this during Happy Hour!  The place was pretty empty of diners now I know why. 
Bring back a happy hour menu with less than $10.00 items like you used to. So disappointed in you PT's."}
{"text":"I love this pub.  It's real nice and well lit on the inside.  Me and my boys usually come here for their pizza special.  It's half off past 12am so a large pizza would come out to 8 bucks which is not bad because they got some good pizza! Best thin crust I've ever tasted.  

Besides the food and booze, they have a game area with 2 pool tables and some TV's that contain a number of games. Dont know what it actually is tho. I just know it's a touch screen and people play games on it and doesn't have anything to do with gambling.  If you wanna play some music there's a big jukebox where you can choose 2 songs per dollar and has it plays through out the bar.  

It's hidden near Ann and Camino Al Norte across the street from Smith's. And past 10, if you try to open the doors and they're locked, don't worry it's not closed they just gotta buzz you in."}
{"text":"First time here. Was excited to try it. 
Man was I disappointed!
The satisfying cold beer and awesome chicken wings were overshadowed by piss poor attitude of bartenders and waitresses and astoundingly long wait to get anything. Manager was standing nearby and did nothing.  Owners get off your butts and do a clean sweep of employees here."}
{"text":"William Hill: I visit occasionally to use the William Hill Machine.  Most of the time the machine at this location has something wrong with it which makes a 5 minute stop more like 20. (Usually it says that the printer is offline) The last time they had to call tech support in the middle of the transaction.  The machine does not take the new hundred dollar bills as of 1/09/14 and is very picky with the actual bills it will take.  Bring lots of cash or be prepared to exchange bills with the bartender.

Why a 5 star rating: I have never had anything to eat or drink here so I wont' give a 2 star rating for a convenience they offer customers that has lots of flaws.  Pt's shouldn't get a bad review from me if I haven't actually parked myself at the bar for food, drinks, gambling, etc..

I just wanted others to be aware that a different location may be better if you are going just for the William Hill Machine.  If you miss a bet you will understand the frustration."}
{"text":"This place needs ventilation!   So smoky in here. 
For a new local bar, disappointed they didn't do better."}
{"text":"Nice location, by my new salon, the Eli Sabot.  They were out of Champagne though :( ... Ill be back though.."}
{"text":"Jesus. I go to 1 PTs and then go to another and they both fuck up. The service is great but Jesus I ask for curly fries or coo coo fries at one place and get regular and then another location I ask for lemon pepper wings and I get the blandest wings to man. Is it that difficult to get one singular order at 7 am correct?"}
{"text":"I have visited this pts a few times now and never seem to leave satisfied. I love the pts chain and in hopes to like this one since it is right by my house, I have given it multiple chances.

This particular time that I visited was the worst service I have received from a pts location. I was grabbing a drink with a friend and there were two other parties at the bar, with the rest of the bar being empty. She was busy chatting it up with one of the groups of guys and never came to us when we wanted our check. I stayed to order food at 11:45 and she came back at 12 to tell me she told the other bartender to put it in since they were doing a shift change. My beer ran low and he never checked on me nor did I receive my food and it was 12:20. The group of boys that she was originally helping did however receive their pizza that was not put in until 12.

I usually go late at night so the day bartenders might be great, but this is definitely not a good choice for a late night drink/snack unless you just want to sit there twiddling your thumbs."}
{"text":"This is a great PT's! I'm so glad I stopped in by chance. Definitely a nice surprise to find it in this corner of Summerlin, protected from the buzzing of the 215 by no offramp. One of the best PT's experiences I've had!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bartenders & staff. They are all friendly and easy to talk to! this location is very close to my house so I will be coming here often. There food is always fresh & I have no issue with the way the drinks are made!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Do alot of lunchs with coworkers here. It always very clean and the service is always very good. Very fast. I usually do a burger or sandwhich and I am always happy. For some reason the onion rings here are unusually good."}
{"text":"I usually love going to PTs especially during happy hour, but I had a horrible experience tonight for my girlfriends birthday. There were about 7 of us and we all ordered drinks, food and pool. We were greeted immediately as we walked in but after that was terrible service. I ordered 2 beers and pool, that were given to us right away and then a pizza. We went over by the pool table and the guy told us we will bring out the pizza in about 5-10 min. Well, 15 min. Went by and everyone around us had got there nachos, chili fries and pizza. I went back up to the counter and stood there as the bartender joked and served all the \"regulars\" as he walked by multiple times and he finally asked me if I needed something. I said ya I ordered a pizza and haven't got it yet, his response oh you ordered a pizza and I said yes I even asked what type of pizzas they have. He said ok we will have it right out in about 5-10 min. Later. All of our other friends had left by this time about 20 min. Later he comes out with our pizza not in a box and I said could I get that to go please? He walked away and mumbled under his breath \"are you fu**ing kidding me?\" He brought it back out in a Togo box and we went to go grab my card at the bar and they didn't take anything off or discount anything for the inconvenience nor did they apologize, which would have been sufficient enough to get a tip. I won't be going back to this location..... horrible service"}
{"text":"I'll open by saying that it delivers three things for me and friends that go in:  it's close, it serves great bar food and drinks, and it's cheap.  The entire bar is clean and presented well.  And the staff are always friendly, if ever changing.

There are two pool tables, plenty of LCD tvs for watching sports, and a few games to play.  As a close neighborhood bar it delivers.

Walk in and say hello to Steve at the bar.  He's a great bartender.

As a chain, it's not creative.  It isn't unique.  But this location in particular does a great job at delivering on what PTs does best."}
{"text":"As I'm noticing from the reviews, I'm far from the only one that feels a little frustrated about the service that I received from this particular PT's Gold location. I have been to several other locations but have NEVER had such a bad experience. I went to this particular location on June 23rd with a friend and during that time (around 5:30- 6pm) it was surprisingly slow, not busy at all. We however, still received mediocre service, our waitress was far from attentive to taking our orders initially. My co-worker and I both ordered drinks at which time the bartender/waitress tasted both drinks using \"one straw\" which she flipped to taste.  I've been to SEVERAL bars, restaurants, etc., and NEVER has a \"trained bartender\" had to taste my drink, yet left that to me, the patron to confirm what if anything my drink needed or not. Not only is this not sanitary but unprofessional. If every bartender making drinks had to \"taste\" their own product, there would be a world of sick individuals from the spread of germs. Some of the better bars and restaurants that I've been to also ask which type of Vodka's preferred in the particular drink that I ordered. This was not asked by the waitress, which I get it is PT's Gold. Apparently there is justification for this by their standards. In no way should there be a wait for plain water if the place isn't busy. Not attentive at all. Lesson learned. If you want a quick drink, minus great service, this is the place for you. If you're perhaps used to quality this may not be the place for you. Not speaking of ALL PT's just this one. I've been to most here in Las Vegas. POOR service."}
{"text":"It's PT's, everyone knows what to expect, local bar with great drink prices and decent drunk munchies. Late night, ADAM is the man! Super nice bartender that already knows what your going to have to drink. A nice place to hang after a long day at work. Tip well, those bartenders will take care of you no problem"}
{"text":"The food is just bad. You can buy a cheap frozen pizza at the store and get a better tasting one. Burgers are generally dry and nachos are a tasteless mess with canned cheese spread. 

If you're with a group don't bother going to the bar for a drink. I was told that I had to wait for my waitress to take my order at my table - that made it 25 minutes for just a beverage. Half price special on drinks only applies to those with alcohol - what if you don't drink. Seems a bit unfair.

Too many other neighborhood places with good food to waste your time at any PT's location."}
{"text":"Horrible. Walked in, sat a table with my friends, bartender/cocktail waitress walks to table and first thing she says \"can I see your IDs\" Not a hi, hello, how are you doing....nothing. She set the atmosphere with such negative energy and this was my first time visiting this place. I was appalled as I'm not accustomed to this type of service and greeting. I will probably never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always great service. Play pool, watch sports, cuddle in a back booth or a comfy couch. Clean & welcoming. A neighborhood nugget"}
{"text":"Food great even though timing is slow but that just due to less staff working the place"}
{"text":"The service is great. I honestly think PT'S sets the standard for bars outside of the strip. That being said I believe this might be the worst bar chain to gamble at.  I've hit on 8 out of 10 at the last place I would expect BWW twice in a week but I've never hit on more than 6-10 at any PT'S bar. When you consider I go to PT'S bars 2 out of 3 night I call that lousy odds."}
{"text":"I used to love going to this P T's Bar & Grill and it's located kind of on the corner of Bermuda and Silverado ranch. They have 3 pool tables and a large dartboard area so it's a great place to go hang out and hang out with your friends. One night when I was in there drinking pretty heavily I got into an altercation with another customer and things escalated very quickly as they do when alcohol is involved. The patron ended up getting in my face and it was really a total bummer of a situation but the bartenders didn't seem to mind again in between the matter and they could tell something was going on. I've been going here and drinking for a while didn't want to get into a fight at the bar and at the same time could have used a little bit of help while getting into the altercation."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's close to the house, but the waitress did really bad job, I wait 8 min in table before they took order, bring the order no plates, forks or napkins, after 20'min inside the restaurant she ask for the money because the waitress had to leave, bar tender guy super professional, need to improve with waitress."}
{"text":"Bartender is super RUDE, what part of customer service are you not clear on. This is a classic dive bar and that's fine but if you want customer's to come back you need to at least be hospitable.
Super nice waitress and the food is okay."}
{"text":"Menu is pretty week. Bartender was OK but she was busy talking to a couple regulars a lot. She was very polite though. Had taco salad and it was OK I've had better.  I have to say PTS gambling and free beer sucks!!! I put $40 in machine and was only comped one beer. Bartender said I will be here next Sunday if you come in I will give you a free one. Like she will remember me and I'm not going out of my way nor returning to ANY PTS until they get their gambling comps figured out. I've never liked them since they went big corporation and thought I would give them another chance, they failed"}
{"text":"This is the worst bar ever! Ordered a pizza and literally 30 mins later nothing came... went to the bar tender guy.. some white 40 old guy says they gave it to someone else and they gonna make some in 10 minutes... serious?! They need to keep their s$#* together... 

When we got here.. it was 1:20 am and they literally waited until 1:57 to serve and charge us not the happy hour price... for real ... ive been to many pts but this is the worst beyond my belief... never coming back ever ..."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Basic neighborhood bar.  I will say the restaurant portion though is slightly nicer than most.  Sat in the bar area though since it was quite slow.

Food:  Pizza was on happy hour so split one of those.  Was thin crust with a sweet sauce that tasted okay.  Also split an order of sweet potato fries.  They were also okay, but did not have much of a sweet potato taste.

Service:  There were two female bartenders. Our server/bartender was nice.  I think anytime you don't sit at the bar you risk slower service.  This was not the case really.

Price:  On happy hour pizza is 50% off which is great.  Not sure I would want to pay full price.

Overall an okay experience and I would go back to catch a game on happy hour or to play video poker."}
{"text":"Today I was in the Henderson area & decided to stop in to the PT's on Horizon & Horizon. The bartenders name was Michelle & the service was AMAZING! They have a waitress too, Becky, and she was ALSO AMAZING! Very friendly staff & a very inviting atmosphere. Being a single female i felt really comfortable in the environment. I will most definitely be returning to see these girls! Great food, great drinks & outstanding personalities from these two ladies! Thanks Michelle & Becky, I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"It's a PT's. It's got all the makings of a PT's. You'll find here what you find at most every PT's. PT's are to my Vegas neighborhood what Starbucks were to my DC neighborhood. There's practically one on every corner. This is a nice PT's. Feels newer and cleaner. Friendly and attentive bartenders. Never crowded. It's...a PT's."}
{"text":"Love everything about!! Great food amazing drinks Especially service from Lakey very friendly !!!"}
{"text":"Service was so awesome and friendly. I can't believe the difference to the rainbow location. My only complaint is that it's always empty."}
{"text":"Love that this location is right by us.  We hit it up after a party for a night cap, which turned into a few, ha ha.  Place is great because it's new.  Clean.  Not smoky.  Big bar.  Sitting areas.  Clientele was nice.  Legit cool, neighborhood people.  Chill, relaxing, super casual hangout. 
 We were super dressed up from our party and no one batted an eye, which was cool.  Service was great - wish I could remember our waitresses name.  We sat at a couch and chair area.  She hooked us up all night.  Good drinks.  Didn't have to wait to catch her attention. 
 She was awesome.  Didn't have any food this visit.  Will revise for next time.  Really glad to have this neighborhood location.  Keep up the great service! :)  We enjoyed our night."}
{"text":"I really like this PT's. The layout is definitely one of the better ones. Large square bar. Elevated pool table area. Some tables and booths. Not too dark. Very clean and well-kept. And Molly, one of the bartenders, is super nice, friendly, and attentive. Otherwise, it's a PT's. There's on across the street and one up the street. And then a few more down the next street. But the vibe is particularly nice at this one and Molly was a standout bartender."}
{"text":"This is my go-to PT's. It was the very first PT's I ever visited in Vegas. And it still holds a special place in my heart. I like the setup of this PT's. And I like the friendly and attentive bartenders. I also like that it never feels too smokey or too crowded here. And if I want to stop for a drink or bite during the day, there's usually 0-5 other people in the entire place. And I think that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"I called today at 6:55 to order a pizza I spoke to CHRISTIAN who told me the discount would not be honored bc it was 6:55? The special is til 7??? Is that not what it says? I asked what time I needed to call next time to get the deal and he told me 6:45, ok then your special shouldn't say 7. My receipt even clocked at 7:00 on the dot.  Thank god dasia was able to grant the deal bc the receipt said 7:00."}
{"text":"This is a pretty small PT's. Circular bar. Some high top seating around the place. Plenty of TVs. Nice, friendly, and attentive bartenders. What else can I say? It's a PT's. You get here pretty much the same as what you get at every other PT's location. I do appreciate, though, that this location is on the smaller side and rarely ever crowded. No crowd = happy me."}
{"text":"Their pizza was amazing!!! We also ordered the nachos and good thing me and my boyfriend split them! They were huge!! And delicious!!! Bar tender was awesome!! Happy hour was great! Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I just moved back to Henderson after being out of state for 3 and a half years and I decided to get my car washed and to stop into this PT's for lunch, I used to do this periodically when I used to live here and enjoyed it every time, this time was severely different.  The food was decent but the service was absolutely the worst I have ever experienced at any restaurant. 

Everything started off normally, the server (Marie) came around, took our drink order, brought the drinks, took our food order, everything is normal... 

I ordered a chicken taco salad, my fiancee order \"the burger\"

We then spent around 30 minutes waiting for our food, there was only one other customer in the dining area so it wasn't exactly busy.

\"The\" burger that we received was fine.  The taco salad I ordered came out with beef, I was fine with this so I decided to just eat it (it was a toss up between beef or chicken when I ordered so whatever).  When she came back around I notified her that she made a mistake. She proceeded look at me like I was speaking a foreign language, then said I just ordered a taco salad (I know I did not and my fiancee confirmed).  The then said she just \"hit the button for a taco salad on her screen and that's what was made\" - ok, I don't care what you did, it's wrong. She made excuse after excuse without even offering to fix the problem. She eventually left without resolving the problem... ehh, whatever, I'll just decrease her tip, I don't really have a problem with eating the beef anyways.

After she leaves, she is not seen again for nearly 40 minutes, we finished eating our food and sat there... and sat there... and sat there waiting for her to return with the check.  We saw glimpses of her in the back chatting away on her cell phone.  Only when we actually walked back to get her did she get off her phone and come out to check on us, the other table with customers were waiting to pay as well, instead of bringing the check she just tried to take their credit card.  She eventually figured out what she was supposed to be doing and brought the checks and let us pay like normal.

She knew were were angry by the time she got back and proceeded to give me permission not to tip her.  She said \"you don't have to tip\" due to her poor service. Highly unprofessional telling the customer what we can and can't tip, I didn't need her permission not to tip.

I used to really enjoy this place but I don't think I will be back if the employees don't care about actually taking care of the customers, I am fine with service being a little slow or other issues, but if something is pointed out as being incorrect, shouldn't it be fixed? I don't think I should ever have to get in an argument over what I ordered and told that I'm wrong. Also, if there are two groups at tables in the restaurant, shouldn't it be easy to take care of them? It's not like they were packed or anything."}
{"text":"It's a chain so lower your expectations. I've always had decent service with a smile. My only problem is how limited seating at the bar is. You have to either catch some luck or find yourself gambling. The place is a bit dingy but it's local and the service has always been excellent. Take it as you will."}
{"text":"Lemon Pepper Wings hands done---- and happy hour drinks

LUV it Luv it"}
{"text":"I think we gave this bar three different attempts but each time it was the same thing. Slow, inattentive bartenders. Two of the 3 times the bar was DEAD so no excuse of being busy. We also went for New Year's Eve and it was busy then but again inattentive service and then there was a bartender who was off the clock playing a machine and holding seats for friends that she had been waiting for to even show up to the place. She was also prancing around like she owned the place going behind the bar and helping herself to whatever it was she needed. I can't say that I blame her though as it's probably the only way to get drinks there. The only positive thing was that it's a nice, new, clean bar and I loved the interior design and decor but with the service I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Put $40 in the machine and got served on beer....i was looking for the bartender and I figured she was in the bathroom...come to find out I see her sitting in her car smoking on her cell phone...thus was Sunday arou d 3pm...never going back I'll stick with my regular bar."}
{"text":"We usually have a great experience at any PTs we go to but apparently this is the exception. Sat there for 15 minutes before being acknowledged then another 5 before finally giving up and walking out without even a drink order. 4 different employees walked by and looked at us then kept walking. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love 
coming here after work to enjoy ourselves with Lise the bartender.  Tonight is the NCAA national tournament and it is slammed busy in here.  The bartender is all by herself and the New G. M.  Is in the office NOT helping at all.  There aren't any food servers in the place but there are people all around ordering food and drinks , so Lise is not only battening but taking food orders and serving them  .This is very poor scheduling for a huge basketball game plus out local Golden Knight's play tonight also.  The G. M.  Keeps walking out but not even trying to help out!  Lise deserves a 10 rating for her crazy hard work and the G. M.  Should be written up!"}
{"text":"I know there are 10 million PT's but this one is really nice. Not very crowded since it's so far from the strip and there is a newer location down the road. 
I was looking to play pool and the other location did not have a pool table. This location has 2 pool tables and shuffleboard table. 
The waitresses were really nice and happy hour was awesome. The PT's draft beers are pretty good. I didn't order any food, but some of the appetizers were $5 during happy hour. Lots of parking and right off the main road."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a 5 but they ain't got no pool table. I'm still wondering why they built this literally across the freeway from the other PTs lol I love the modern look tho and how the bar is pretty lit. You got the literally surrounding the whole entire pub. Bartenders are on point. Little advise for the cocktail waitress tho. Smile more. But other than that cool new spot to kick it"}
{"text":"Ambiance here is legit dope. They just remodeled it feels new. 6 pool tables. High key tho the staff looks lost AF a lot of new faces compared to the normal people I see all the time."}
{"text":"I would have like to tried the food but your bartender refused to take my 100 dollar bill - its a restuarant/casino. \"If the machine won't take it I can't take it'.."}
{"text":"Seriously had the same bartender experience as someone mentioned above -   least attentive person ever. Litterally left there in 5 minutes to drive over to Sierra gold it was so bad."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered food at PT'S it was great so we decided to eat there again that same week. I picked up our food and brought it home since I was coming home from work. Our order was wrong and the food we did get was not cooked correctly. I called and spoke to the bartender I picked up and place our order with. He assured me I could come back in and he would take care of it. I informed he I may not be returning that night but when I had toe time or are there again(knowing it would be that same week). When I tried to call and place the order and get it corrected from earlier that week the waitress with very rude and started asking me why I didn't come back sooner and why I waited a few days and she didn't have any info on me( even thought I left my name with the bartender). I understand that she may not be able to honor it because she didn't have my name written down but that's not my problem,
I left my name. And instead of just apologizing they messed up the first time with our order and again with not taking my complaint down, she decided to make me feel like I did something wrong because I don't have time to return back that same day. I didn't mess this up, you guys did! Take some responsibility instead of blaming me for not wasting more money and gas on this location. I will wait and call again when the manager works, which apparently isn't often. Too bad because out first experience was great."}
{"text":"Pro: Very nice inside. 
Cons: Bartenders lack any personality. Any attempt to spark conversation or joke around was completely ignored. 

Prices, to add insult to injury we spent way more than we expected for a \"neighborhood\" bar. 

We won't be back"}
{"text":"I been coming to this bar for 2 years and it has to be one of my favorite spot to have a drink.  I have met great people here, the bartender is great, and happy hour is always the best.  Compare to other PTs I have been too this has to be far the best.  Weather your coming to watch some good football, grab a bite to eat, or just chill with some friends play some pool and enjoy a great time I highly recommend this place.  Especially on Fridays, and Saturdays evening come on down for Happy Hour.  Thank for reading and enjoy."}
{"text":"Average Food and utterly hideous service.  I would not go back.  'nuff said"}
{"text":"Nice place, okay service. The only thing I would nitpick about is how pricey their fried pickles are. They were good, but $8.00 for 6 small pieces is a little steep, I feel like I got robbed. I'll stick to Bdubs fried pickles from now on."}
{"text":"Chef accommodated a special request and food was very good. Service was very good and drinks were never close to empty. Dining area was comfortable and clean. Server scored even more bonus points at the end by NOT asking \"do you neeeed change?\".   Caution to patrons: there is a tall curb directly in front of the building on your way to the entrance.  Would be safer if a wide curb ramp was there."}
{"text":"I love getting breakfast here! It's a big meal for just a couple bucks and it's good! We often call it in and pick it up because it's very close to the office."}
{"text":"Awww, PTs... Usually this is a solid choice, but apparently not on the night of the college football championships. Maybe they were short staffed, or something, but the night was fraught with errors. 

We waited for quite awhile before our waitress took our drink orders. She brought our beverages (just iced tea and water), and we had to ask for menus. That took awhile longer. I ordered the Bikini Wrap, but with honey mustard instead of ranch, no onions, and sweet potato fries.

The meals came...but with no utensils. We had to hunt her down for those. Mine had regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. We signaled for her, and she apologized and took the plate. It took FOREVER to get the replacement meal, and when I did, the fries were completely overcooked..Almost burned. SIGH.

Ok, so the wrap has to be good, right? Nope. It was FULL of onions, and had the ranch, not the honey mustard I requested. I tried to pick through it, but I was pretty disappointed. Our waitress never came back to check on us.

Another waitress came over to clear our plates and give us the bill. We did mention all of the issues, and to her credit, she took my bikini wrap and the iced tea off of the bill. I'm hoping that it was just an off night, but I was pretty disappointed overall. Le sads..."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I always seem to win there on video poker. Good music, laid back staff, Good food."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad.  It's a nice local hangout where you can get pretty good prices on food and drinks during happy hour and play some pool.  The service can be a little suspect but that is only every once in a while.  It's a good place to go and grab a drink after a hard day."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood bar Ozzy and Mandi on swings always take care of us always a great time here there energy and great customer service keep me and my friends coming back not a single complaint great local bar.. Tweed on grave is awesome as well love this bar"}
{"text":"The worst bartender ever . This people were moving in slow motion and they would not even acknowledge that u were in the bar waiting to order . It took 25 min to get a round of drinks which were shots easy to poor , it's not that they are making special cocktails is just beer and shots. Never ever  going back  ."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, bartender took over 15 minutes to notice us, 15 more minutes to get our drinks and another 20 for our food to arrive. beautiful place but not worth it. will not go back to it. This place sucks!!"}
{"text":"Just like any other PTs, they have that 12 am to 2am HH. 

Service is aight. Bartender didn't know what a black velvet was. Eh. 

Food? Good. It tasted the same like any other PTs. 

A good spit if you're in the 89148 area."}
{"text":"Haha as You can tell.... I love PT's. Been visiting PT's locations for years. None disappoint and yet each one has it's own style/flare. 
Great place for football!!"}
{"text":"Its new. The style of the decor is very nice. Bring a sweater for those who are sensitive to cold. I always like going to PT's, the ones that are new like this one. 
This place wasnt that busy but there's only one bartender and one server so its kinda slow but we didnt mind at that time. We are coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Nice enough inside, great view of mccarran runways. 
Came here for lunch, 45 minutes from order to food, unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Our bartender, Charlee, was great. His service was terrific. The prices for a suburban chain bar were high. $19.50 for two cocktails sounds more of a strip location."}
{"text":"I love the location next to the airport ,check out the patio chill place to watch the planes land. \" Amazing service btw \"!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this pts a negative star rating I would. The service was subpar at best, with our waitress charging an automatic 18% gratuity just because we had people keep coming to celebrate our wedding. Also we were never informed if this charge until the bill came. Then come to find out the manager has good and bad waitresses and let's them charge what they want for shots. 10 shots for $100 is ridiculous. Just because our waitress didn't tell us we would get charged drink prices for each shot. Bunch of con artists at this bar. Stay away"}
{"text":"I just came here last night. It is my first time and very love it!! Haha have fun songs and service is good. Staffs are friendly and nice! After midnight have discount 50% for drink and appetizers. That's so great deal!"}
{"text":"Great chill pub to hang out with friends at.  There is outdoor seating and couches out there so you can hang out, lounge, drink and laugh with your friends.  The service is a little slow, but since I was in no rush, it suited us fine.  There are also pool tables in the back and there were a lot of TVs throughout the place to keep you up to speed on sports if that's what you are looking for.

I'd go there again not only because they carry Kona Longboard Lager (since most places don't) but also because of the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by for their grand opening last night and had a great night. Never been to a PT's before so I figured this was a perfect opportunity to check it out, even though it was far SW. Apparently this place used to be an O'Aces tavern, but you would've never guessed it because the inside looked brand new and was not smoky at all. We arrived at 7 pm, about an hour late for the event and it was already packed inside! So packed that it took a while to squeeze into the bar area to place drink orders. Eventually we were able to track down a waitress to take care of us the rest of the night, otherwise there would've been a lot of waiting at the bar!

They had a couple specials going on including $2 Stellas and $1 vodka or tequila shots...which were kinda gross, but hey it was only a buck! The gf had a couple of signature cocktails, which were full price but wasn't bad at $6-7.50 each. There were a couple of Stella girls promoting their beer and handing out gifts to people drinking Stellas. We got a Stella chalice glass and a bottle opener for pounding down Stella pints all night long.

The bar area is big, and there are non gaming seats for those that just want to have a drink or watch the game. There is also a small seating area to the right of the bar for dining and another dining area just to the left of the restrooms. Overall seems like a pretty nice place to hang, especially with the 2 pool tables and a small patio area with gas heaters, which is where we sat despite the light rain. The staff was friendly and fast once they actually got to you and I don't see it being as packed on normal nights here. 

They have happy hour from 5 to 7 PM and again later on in the evening, featuring 50% off drinks and pizzas, so I'll have to come back to check that out in the future!"}
{"text":"Literally here right now and the service is terrible. With a group of 6 people, when we first got here it took about 15 min to even take our order, then another 15-20 to being the beers out, We ask to change the TV to the cardinals games, not even 15minutes later these three rich golf club looking white people come in and IMMEDIATELY get their orders taken, drinks came put so fast, we ordered pizza when we got here and somehow those people got their food first. The server, keeps going up to them asking how everything is while we are still waiting on a few of our drinks and pizza. Then just because they asked to watch the raiders game they changed our fucking game when every other fucking tv had their game. Bullshit. Then when we asked to change it back they had attitude. Not once did the server come up to us and ask how everything is. Everytime we come here it's the same thing. We have them one more chance and they suck. They do us more on the rich people. Terrible costumer service. The PTs on Fort Apache with the bartender Jennifer is the best one. Her service is ALWAYS on point. The server here is terrible, he walks around doing nothing, then comes out from the back always with food in mouth. Walking by like we haven't been waiting on our drinks n food. I work customer service. This place is the worst. 
So don't think a new PTs would be better than the one you've been going to. ?"}
{"text":"Obviously this place has low ratings for a reason. I don't know why I let my girlfriend drag me here. But I don't think she'll ever get me to go back. 

$12 for a large PTs brew? what? What? What? Service was good, but $12 for a mediocre home brew gets you I'll never be back again. Better beers out there at far better prices. For $6 I can get the same size of a better beer at Mulligans on Boulder along with better and more affordable food!

Down to one star for wasting my time. They asked me to contact customer service, which I did last week. I wrote a lengthy letter explaining my experience. No reply or anything from anyone addressing my issue. It is obvious this company really doesn't care.  

I won't miss passing up this overpriced mediocre dive bar. Do yourself a favor and visit a establishment that cares about locals. There are far better options around. 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband always come in the bar we have never had any issue with any bartender. Until today we order an order of bourbon wings which came in a meal and a side order of fries to go. When my husband  brought the wings home and we started to eat I bit into one wing and it was gummy and smelled like they cook dirty chicken  in dirty grease. And I also noticed the wing was battered in flour and fried. So I immediately called the location on Ann road to explain to the lady Westley the situation with my food.she argued me on the phone not even listening to what the customer  was trying to express to her she displayed poor customer service and it seems like this is not the first time someone has reported her. So I told her I was on my way to show her how poorly her food was served to the customer. When I arrived I showed her how the chicken was battered and how pink and gummy the chicken was and she still argued with me and said she was calling the police and denied me my money back. Like I Express we were normal regular customers with no issues ever and I will never go back to a place that doesn't respect and value customer service I will also spread the word. If you value your establishment you need to rectify the situation immediately. 

Signed a used to be loyal customer"}
{"text":"All the PT been too really enjoy this one the best! I enjoy the way the restaurant is set up from the dining area, outdoor patio lounge area and outside dining, nice pool table lounge area with comfortable couch and chairs sit on, and tv more then enough wide screens above the bar or around pool table lounge area. The Happy Hour not agree more with everyone the best HH in vegas. The size beer you get for the price not go wrong period. The food for HH is good too. Draft beers they have bunch on tap too choose from all included in HH price. I like vibe. It fun place too party with friends."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service!!!!! Inattentive!!!! Allows customers to be rude to others!!!!! And supports the rudeness!!! HORRIBLE RUDE STAFF"}
{"text":"Came here a few times already, I just forget to write a review on them. But...here I am setting time aside just to write a review.

My first time here wasn't so pleasant. I usually go to a different PT's, but this one happens to be closer to me, so I decided to check it out. came around 6pm which is when their happy hour is (5pm-7pm and 12am-2am). Ordered the sliders that came with a side of fries. I wish I took a picture of what we had ordered, but in all honesty, we were just so hungry that we couldn't wait to dig in! 

The food was okay, their beers are always good because I like Blue moon on TAP. My boyfriend gets the Stella on TAP, which is just as good.

The only bad thing I could really say about them is the service they have. We always get the bartender Tracy every time we go. And for some reason, she wasn't very nice in the beginning. But, I think it might also be because they're just so busy around the 5pm happy hour. She was a little bit nicer the next time we came, and even said she'd remember us the next time we come. I hope she does! I'm looking forward to coming here more often because it's super convenient to me!"}
{"text":"Been here many times but tonight will be the last time coming here. Male bartender was good repeated the first round drink order. Second round I only had two drinks, female bartender was slow took forever to say anything to me. Told her my order but I guess she only heard one drink. The drink she didn't hear was a pint of beer and I asked again where the beer was and she said sorry and handed me the bill with attitude so I payed the tap and left. Sorry PT's pub you have lost a customer."}
{"text":"There are PT's everywhere but this is my favorite one. It's like 10 minutes from my house. It doesn't reek of smoke like all the other ones - a definite plus in my book! And the staff is super friendly. I left my phone on the table here once and as I was driving off, the server literally chased after my car and flagged me down to give my phone back! I'd say that's awesome customer service that continued even AFTER we left! I absolutely love it. I always get guinness when I drink beer and yeah, it's always a slower pour and I expect that. The thing I didnt expect is that they always scoop off the extra foam to fill it up with more beer! All the more to love this place :D"}
{"text":"First time here, surprisingly crowded at 1:45am on a Friday morning. Took roughly 10min and $6 of gambling before anyone checked for me. I'm not really in a rush to gamble away money. Ordered my wings and fries, (Tried em at the PT's on Lake Mead/Tenaya). I'm hoping they come out good, but the bar tender really charged me $5 for pineapple juice and sprite?... Typically I would've tipped $10 as a habit, but if you're gonna charge me that while I'm gambling and I'm not even ordering alcohol, I'm not to pleased. I'll update once the food comes.

I'm actually a fan of the original seasoning that comes on the fries. I called myself looking for that salt with the hint of sweetness, I guess they were lightly seasoned this time. The gentleman who delivered the food sat/slid me the plate and walked away. He didn't check to see if I liked what I saw or if I needed anything else, but I did end up needing a bar caddy and a replacement ketchup. I'm not complaining, just relaying the experience. Wings are piping hot, but I don't think this is enough ranch. I'm trying to read the name tags, but the small black lettering against the gold is hard to get a good look at in this light without me having to stop them just to ask if I could read it (I'm wearing my glasses, and my prescription isn't old). The bartender who charged me for sprite just asked my bar neighbor if he was doing ok. I haven't heard from him since I ordered my food. I think he should've asked me if my drink was ok since I haven't touched it at all. I just asked Jessica, Brent is my BarTender. I was happy to come try this meal here, I'm not as satisfied as I thought I would be. I don't even want the drink anymore, but these wings on, and I learned that I have to scrape the fries to get that twist I was looking for initially. Good day yelpers. 


...Wait,... Brent just asked the bar neighbors to my other side if they were ok. ...totally walked by me again, no words.


Welp,... I won $50+ dollars on the machine so I drank my drink. The security guy at the door was kind as can be. Still hadn't heard from Brent."}
{"text":"Apparently coming for the shift change on a Friday before happy hour is a bad time. I was under the impression there would be stellar service but I was wrong. Sabrina initiated our date and was stellar. To my dismay, once Ozzie took over along side the short blonde with the rude attitude service became scarce. Being a part of the service industry, I felt like I should be compassionate or understanding then the blond gets totally inconsiderate when we asked for clarification on why we weren't offered a drink for 40 minutes even while gambling and dining. Then the drink was charged to my tab instead of compensated due to my play. I don't think people like to be treated like they aren't valued guests PT's Gold. I remember having such a good time here once for a friends birthday and that's why I came back. Totally felt unappreciated and almost as if I was a nuisance to the short lady behind the bar with the hole in the arse of her True Religion jeans showing her underwear, which were black today. Shameful service PT's"}
{"text":"This is an ok place, i went on a Monday evening at around 6pm. Brian the bartender seemed to display excellent service while his partner Julie seemed to have adopted the \"I dont really want to be here\" demeanor....No smile or really much of anything besides a deadpan personality.

The Food was just okay, nothing to write home about thats for sure, it served the purpose.

PT's drink prices seem a tad more expensive than some of the other bars in the immediate area,"}
{"text":"Went on a late Sunday night to hang out with some cousins. Decided we were hungry so we ordered some chicken FINGERS. What came out? Chicken wings. We didn't fuss because we all work in the food industry and know what's it's like for an order to be returned. So we finished them and apparently still hungry. So we order the 2 lbs of wings with three sauces. Golden, medium, and garlic Parmesan were our choices. Well we had a little extra surprise. As soon as the server gave us our food my cousin immediately found a hair on one of the wings. We told the server about it, he just said, \"I don't know how that got in there. I promise you were clean. You can even go back in the kitchen to see it.\" Uh no thanks. We tell the bartender about it, and even showed it to him. He just was like oh yeah sorry. He gave us the check and he didn't even discount the wings. Not expecting it, but when something like that happens, you have to accommodate somehow."}
{"text":"Well, this is a PT's... gold...   Not sure whats different between the original and the gold...  But I didnt really pay much attention to that...     the service was excellent, the beer was good, cold and plentiful... not much more you can ask for.  I really liked it there.  The waitress was over a lot to check on us and was very pleasant to deal with.   The bartender was also very personable.  all in all it was a great experience there and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Molly is the best bartender you have at any location. She is so personable and kind and is so on point with drinks and food. She's my favorite bartender not just at PT'S but anywhere I go. I love coming in when I know she's there because I know I'll have a great time!!! Keep it up Molly!!! Yer the best!!!"}
{"text":"Sean is a great bartender. He proactively came and refilled my drinks and definitely went above and beyond. If you want good service go to this pts."}
{"text":"I HATE HATE HATE when I get a great experience one day and a total different experience the very next day. Absolutely love the food here but can't stand terrible customer service. Haley knocked it out the park 100% last night about 11:00 pm last night and went above and beyond. BUT TODAY I come in and greeted by the bartender with the long beard first before the waitress Kristine who not once looked at me, gave very short answers with no alternative (Do the bucket of chicken fingers come with fries? No.), didn't smile once, continued conversation with other staff members as if I wasn't standing there and I had to set my menu down next to her because she didn't care to engage me even said hi (oh wait she didn't say hi). Upon receiving my food she set my food and and check down while never stopping to say anything. Again I love this place, the food and happy I got a great experience first because I for sure would've never came back. Moving forward I will request Haley or anyone else except Kristine."}
{"text":"So because I'm pregnant I couldn't go to PT's so we decided to order for pickup. I ordered the Club wrap, my husband ordered the Cheese Steak and we ordered chili cheese tots. My wrap was disgustingly salty and the mayo was warm and gross. I was sadly and extremely disappointed. My husband opened his Cheese steak and let's just say the sight of it threw us off. He said the cheese steak was ok, but he was upset that he paid extra for onion rings and only received 6, yes 6 onion rings.

The chili cheese tots were the best and that's not saying much. All of the chili and cheese was on one side and there wasn't very much to begin with. 

Ps, I had my husband taste my wrap just in case my tastebuds were out of whack since I am 30 weeks pregnant and he confirmed that it indeed was. 

I know this location is new and all so I'm hoping that it'll get better."}
{"text":"This is the closest bar to my house, so it's my local by default. Great happy hour deals with a late night happy hour as well. The staff will take great care of you. I appreciate the way they remember my \"usual\" even if it's been a while between visits. I appreciate that they have pool and darts, which makes it a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Yes it's your typical smoky bar. On a Friday night just looking to chat with my friend and have a beer or two.
This bar was more like a Cheers bar.
Locals I believe, fun, chatty, but bartender ladies not paying attention to the bill. Patron's favor of course."}
{"text":"I'm always at this location to hang out, grab a couple drinks or whatever.  This place is like a second home even the bartenders(Frank or Edgar)  that usually work the graveyard shift know my order  once I walk through the door. So I come in on a Sunday night and they have this one female bartender I wasn't familiar with. I ask for a Jameson and ginger ale, as simple as that sounds, she pours a Jameson and club soda. Her explanation was, \"some PT's don't have ginger ale.\" So she remakes it, I downed the first one and asked for another round. She DOES THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN! When I asked her to remake it, she disgustingly takes the cup and pours another shot of Jameson and tells me to take care of this one. All that attitude and still didn't fix the drink. I just took the drink and didn't mind to ask again. I never had such terrible service that it made me ask a friend to use her yelp account to post this. I just know from now on, whenever I see that bartender again, I'm walking out.

{"text":"My husband and I are new-ish to the neighborhood so we were looking up happy hour places to regular. This place came up as \"Best Happy Hour\" so we went. The signage was misleading as it says \"50% off all drinks\" so I ordered one and the bartender pointed out that there was fine print and the drink I ordered was an exclusion. So we ended up ordering margaritas and two appetizers- chicken fries and pizza dippers. I wasn't impressed with any of it. The food did not seem fresh and the drinks were made with cheap gross margarita mix.  The atmosphere is old, dark and smoky. We would not come back. Ever."}
{"text":"went to this location, usually love the whole atmosphere and its always fun and have good service, but at this location they didnt even notice us until 20 minutes later and between our food and drink orders the bartender was no where to be found for the longest time. may have been a bad shift but not understandable on a weds night."}
{"text":"Jodi is awesome!  We come here regularly.  She is always very personable and makes you feel welcomed.  Cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"So we recently moved to the area and saw that this place was nearby. The reviews were bad but we could tell it was from when it first opened-when there's always more business than a company anticipates. Being in management, we decided to take a chance. Turns out.. Awesome experience! Don took great care of us! Made us feel super welcome, and because of it we have found our new local! Facility is clean, service is great and food and drinks are delicious! Keep up the great work!! :D"}

{"text":"It is what it is, the bartenders serve you when you get in but depending on the night its hard to get a drink.  The food is much like all the other PT's so you at least know what you are going to get"}
{"text":"Mandy was amazing! She had the whole bar to herself during a Knights game and was slammed, but still killed it! She should win bartender of the year!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times after work. Last two times have been over charged. First time ordered 5 beers on happy hour, no itemized receipt, noticed when I got home $60.  Second time I forgot to sign the check so they took it upon themselves to tip $40 on a $25 check.  I tip well for good service but that's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Customer service has always been great.
Place is kind of small but it's cozy and I like how they just added a pool table."}
{"text":"Great drinks great staff.
Love the outdoor seating it is awesome on a nice cool day in Vegas.
Gambling is good as well you have a good chance to win compared to the strip."}
{"text":"Awesome! Keeper. Annie, Ashley, Javier-I love this bar & I love my friends!!! Food is great and just the right portions! Great atmosphere and lots of great people are regulars. They have an upstairs area to watch tv or have a party at. They also have beer pong and pool tables."}
{"text":"The best little low key PT's I've been to. It reminds me of the way PTEG bars used to be. I seem to feel very at home in this bar (not just because it's across the street from my house either!)
It's never over crowded and the food is still tasty. Super clean, slightly classy, fantastic service every time - these are the staples of this bar."}

Mark the amazing bartender took care of us so good we literly stayed an hour more just cuz of him.

He should work graveyard .and he deserve a raise lol  Best service ever . Thank you man 
I did lost $100 But it was worth it . 7 shots and 3 beers and I'm heading home .
Good night everyone"}

{"text":"Worst bar in the neighborhood, went in the other night to order food to go. I played $100, got a bill for food (didn't expect anything free) but was charged for a drink & soda. Then was told credit card machine was down so had to get cash?!? I'm not an idiot, I know they comped my drink & pocketed the $. The guy said \"I can't check what you've played \" that's why they have computers back there.... for THAT reason!"}
{"text":"Yum! I may be crazy but PT's never ever disappoint.  We crave pub food! In fact this is one thing we have missed since having a newborn and obviously we can't take her 3 times a week like we used to go."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my go to spot when I get off work,  and I go at least 2 times a week. I usually go in the late nights when Elliott is working and he's awesome, along with the rest of the staff.  I recommend this bar to anyone who lives in the area."}
{"text":"PTs is a classic example of how a good local bar becomes a corporate flop.  The bean counter mentality has prevailed.  The food and drinks are good enough, but everything is overpriced to the tune of about 150%.  They could easily do well on volume by providing better customer value but they choose instead to gouge.  $12 for an $8 hamburger.  Spinach artichoke dip that looks nice when it arrives until you discover the dish is only 1/2 inch deep.  Drink pricing that rivals the Strip.  The dining room is almost always empty and the bar is smokey.  See for yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite bar!! It's close to my house and they always make me feel welcome. Tilly is  awesome!"}

{"text":"Screw Megan and Danny. Worst bartender and server. Tried to charge us for stuff we never ordered. Wouldn't cancel orders we didn't want. Had a bad attitude about everything. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Good place for a local to go and have a drink. The place is clean, people are friendly and the lemon pepper wings are amazing! We like it because its within walking distance for us, but also because its never too crowded. Don't get me wrong, it gets busy but its not crazy like the Vegas clubs... so its a great place to have a drink, hang out and relax."}
{"text":"This was my favorite corner bar. The place that made me think I was Norm from Cheers, where everybody knew my name and was always glad I came. Unfortunately PTs Gold dumped my favorite bartender/friend rudely and without cause. I put up with their mediocre food and so-so beer selection for the sake of hanging out with the best and coolest bartender in the entire state of Nevada, Ken. To add insult to injury they have exiled my bartender friend from even coming into the bar for \"security reasons\" which basically means they know he would explain to regular customers like myself what jerks they were and would turn us against them. I was against the idea of falling love with a corporate establishment, but the bartender made it all worthwhile. Without him, it is just empty and another chain bar in Las Vegas with crappetizers and Bud Light.  Here is one last cheer to Ken, unfortunately it will be from BJs Brew Pub or some other competitor of PTs since I will not be returning.
Update: I also just found out that this chain will only play Fox News.  You can switch up the stations but if news is going to be played, it absolutely must be Fox News.  I find this odd and completely closed-minded.  I am a liberal person and if I owned a chain of restaurants and someone wanted to come in and be brainwashed by Fox News, I would certainly allow my staff to change it to this terrible news station.  These customers are your bread and butter, you should let them watch what they want.  Very strange rule..."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. This place is really close to the house so my cousins and I always come here. We normally come during happy hour which is 12-2. Mike is normally there and he's super friendly. It's pretty clean and great place to just hang out drink and play pool."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday with my Boyfriend!! It was Hot!! Like 115' OMG.. Anyway the Bartender came right over Carrie, So So Friendly!!! She gave Us Waters right away she could see My guy was Real Red and looked like he was about to pass out, lol So we sat and played , she was busy but very attentive with Us!! Very Funny and before we knew it 3 hrs went by!! What a great experience with her , thank you Miss Carrie and Pts:))"}
{"text":"One of the most uncomfortable experiences I have ever had at a bar. The bartender was extremely rude. Not sure of her name but female bartender with short ponytail. She had no personality. Every time I tried to order anything from her I felt rushed or like I was an inconvenience for her. Every time I said thank you to her she didn't say a word back. She aI am usually very understanding even when I have rude servers because I know what it's like to be a server. But she literally didn't try at all. I will never go back to this PTs or another PTs by choice and I would never recommend this bar. Until they can hire people that are little more people friendly. I choose not to give them my business anymore. E"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Never received appetizer, but was on bill.  Ordered a kids meal and never got fries until my daughter finished her chicken, never got refills on drinks. Waitress takes pretzel off bill, brings back card and bill then never charges our card. So we are left sitting again, waiting for her to take bill and bring back the pizza box we asked for 3 times prior.
We were there over an hour for a pizza, garden salad and a kids meal and it wasn't even busy!  Felt bad for waitress as I think she was having a very bad night!"}
{"text":"Love this place to go with friends or the hubby on date night. Enjoy the reasonably priced cocktails as well as the pizza, nachos and many other yummy food choices they offer. Staff is friendly and efficient and it tends not to be overcrowded at this location. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations walking into this location because the one by my work on Pecos & Sunset is the best. Always great service. 

The bar itself at this location is amazing inside. 3 pool tables, large bar with a lot of machines and the lounge section is very nice as well. 
As for the customer service... horrible. 
Worst service I've received from a bartender. 
I get it if it was busy, or on a weekend but we came in on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all. 
The one bartender behind the bar didn't even  acknowledge people as they walked in and then we saw her take her tshirt off so she had a tank top on when a group of men came in. 
The bartender we had rarely checked up on us. 
She did bring us our snack foods pretty fast. But she carded me, heard me call my mom, mom... then carded my mom? Wth?

Just due to bad vibes and bad service, we will no longer be going to this location. If we're on the west side of town and wanna go to a bar, we're going to the Inn Zone."}
{"text":"I will never, ever visit this location again. The female bartenders decided to carry on a conversation about me while we were there to eat dinner. Yes, I realize I am not a size 2, but that doesn't mean I don't have feelings.  The entire time we were there they kept asking where everyone was. Gee, let's see, maybe people don't care to be verbally degraded while they try to enjoy a Friday after a difficult work week!"}
{"text":"I love it here. I feel right at home. It's never jam packed. They have amazing food and cheap happy hours daily from 4pm-7pm and 12am-3am. I go here about twice a week. Pool tables and dart boards are great too."}
{"text":"Wanted to play video poker and walked in and noticed a machine not being played. Sat down to play and the bartender stated that I could not play that machine because someone was coming in to play it. This person was not on the bar yet. Guess my money is not as good as theirs."}
{"text":"Prices are good at this place can't beat the 12am-2am happy hour. The cigarette smoke is definitely more potent than most places, and there is not much staff so if the place is busy you may want to order two rounds at a time. I do like that the music plays louder there than other PT's I have gone too."}
{"text":"Depending on what you're looking for, it's a decent place to go. Local neighborhood establishment. Haven't eaten here, but their drinks are a little watered down (in my opinion). Their video slots allow you to play $0.01, and penny slots are always good!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here since it opened. The first time it was the second day from when they first opened doors and the bartender served everyone else but us. He didn't serve us until I asked if I can get some service which then he bought the first round. I thought ok maybe because it was the second day. Went there today for some breakfast and drinks. The service was terrible one bartender and just a few patrons amongst myself she was talking to her friend I assumed because she was hugging him and laughing and we were gambling and our service was so slow we had to shout excuse me several times to be noticed. Def not coming here again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Daily 5-7pm and 12-2am

Happy hour specials are 50% off drinks & pizzas and $5 select apps. 

This is a relatively new PT's in our area so we thought we would check it out.  We came in a little before 5 and ordered a round.  Our bartender was friendly.  She was the only one working the bar at the time.  It started to fill up as the Knights were playing.  She did good handling everyone. 
 Once happy hour started we had another round and ordered the mixed fry basket and chicharons.  Our bartender came back and said they were out of chicharons so we switched it to chicken taquitos.  Our food took over 30 min to come out.  It seemed like a long time since it was just a couple things that needed to be tossed in a fryer.  Food was ok.  I mean it was fries and taquitos.  Not much to say about it.  A little later our bartender brought us out a order of chicharons on the house.  She said they had one order left after all so she gave them to us.  I thought that was really nice."}
{"text":"Came in with a group for lunch. I ordered the Greek salad which was supposed to come with pepperoncini, tomatoes and feta. It had one pepper and three pieces of tomato with bottled dressing.

At least the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this place three times in the last two weeks and on two of these times there was no waiter or waitress. The bartender yelled from across the room saying that he/she were the only persons their and that we needed to sit at the bar or place an order with them. The last time I was there the bartender was visibly upset do to the lack of staff. There should be more focus on customer service, staffing. On many occasions that I have been to this bar the Male bartenders are fixated on having conversations with female customer's  and do not check up on others in a timely manner, I have also seen customers walk out because they are not tended to. The happy hour menu at all PT's is limited and is too short. I would recommend that PT's stop trying to dominate all neighborhoods and fix these problems before it becomes a failure. I have been to various PT's around town to visit with friends or family and they all seem to be on a decline. I wouldn't recommend coming to this particular PT's due to the experience I have had in the past few visits"}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is for this really pretty waitress. I don't remember her name but she Isaiah works nights. They have good food too. I sometimes play pool but I am pretty terrible at it. The only thing I am good at is getting drunk."}
{"text":"Terrible. I expect more from a place that has been in town for decades. Our table was dirty we asked the waiter to wipe it down he never did we noticed another dirty table on our way out. There was only one other table in there who was finished eating food and had to go boxes and 4 people at the bar, so it appeared as though we were the only ones waiting on food. But the food took forever. And the service was nonexistent. The waiter was sitting in the corner booth most of the time. The salads took an absurd amount of time. When the appetizers finally came they were gross. Especially the dish with the french fries and the marinara sauce. Cheese was nonexistent. Pepperoni should be diced into tiny pieces and they could save money on food cost by putting about half as much on there. Or charge the same price and put some cheese on it. Pretzels were good but beer cheese dip was cold, like refrigerator cold. Short ribs were OK, some had no bone and some were all bone. Only thing that arrived quickly ( prematurely) was the check. We still tipped 15% because we work/worked in the food industry. But he would've gotten much more if this place had any concept of customer service. Definitely will never come back and will not patronize any other location."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars..So me and some coworkers went here last night/About midnight...We are all in the hospitality industry so we know what great service is and we did not receive it...Service was awful..We were having a great time laughing and the bartender screamed from across the bar for us to be quiet...WHAT????Its a bar right?She was so rude..We could not believe it and to top it off the girl who brought the drinks was talking so bad about the bartender to us but then she went to the bar and was laughing and joking with her...So fake..I really don't write yelps but I just had too this time...We will never go back there again..Someone really needs to do something about the staff..All the reviews here say something about the service..Sad!!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new PTs location off Silverado Ranch and Decatur and I consider this a secret nice bar this side of town because it is not as busy. 
The bar and restroom areas are very clean. The staff is friendly and the food comes out the way I like it ordered. Of course the standard 4-7 happy hour specials on pizza and drinks is honored here just like the other locations."}
{"text":"Amazing food... Wonderful staff! Just a fun experience for all! Charlee, Starr, and Dan are warm and friendly... Thanks PT's! ;)"}
{"text":"Do not come to this PTs if you want to watch sports. The old Blond bartender did not want to help us at all. Our waitress told us that we could download the PTs app to be able to listen to the game on our phone so we did, next the Old Blond bartender told us to turn down the game on our phone when they are the ones that suggested it she then turned up her country music to drown it out. We didn't even finish the all star game and left. Was a regular but I will not return."}
{"text":"Drinks are drinks.  Tasted \"goodish\".  Service sucks! The female bartender made it feel like we were asking the world of her to refill our drinks.  There was a total of 4 people including my wife and I.  End of shift...ok I'll accept that but every single drink we had to ask Christina for another.  It's common for a bartender to see one's drink is low or EMPTY and ask or bring another.  Not here. You ask and she says what? Like wtf do you think I am asking for?  Whatever....The Lodge is but a block away.  Next time guess we go there over the local fav. She must have forgotten her job is to pour drinks.  Guess my drink money and machine money are an inconvenience!?!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour. Courtney is the best bar tender and will take very good care of you even if the bar is full. Megan is awesome as well. Cant go wrong with that pair. Food is always fantastic. Besides great happy hour specials the regular menu is just as equally good. And sweet potato fries mmmmmm need I say more. I love all the PTs in town but love this one the best."}
{"text":"Came here because It was close to work ( St Rose hospital ) but your glass sits empty and they take it but never ask if you'd like another???? They seem to spend more time Talking to each other than checking on customers. Food is average - nothing you can't get at BWW or BAR. Better service and food at the Boulavard bar and grille on Las vegas Blvd . While I wrote this , standing at the bar ,been here for 3 hours playing machines have yet to Ask me If I need another drink or even acknowledge we are here unless you call Them over and ask. Then are treated like you are bothering them"}
{"text":"What is so fucking hard about \"cheese only\"?  

Got my to go order that I can't eat now because the bartender ignored my explicit instructions.

People have food allergies - how do you not know that??  Thanks for stealing $15 from me.

Will never return."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I've been to this location twice recently and I have to say its becoming a favorite.  I like that it has high ceilings and lots of windows - light is a good thing even though this whole damn city doesn't seem to think that.

Its also right across from the airport so you can grab a table by the window and watch the planes go by.  I always appreciate an interesting (and free) view.

The food has been pretty good but the service really needs improvement.  I do have to say that the waitresses I've dealt with were very nice but very slow.  I don't know if they need a busboy for backup with drink refills/silverware/condiments etc or another waitress to handle the amount of customers but it does seem to take longer than it needs to for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.

Oh, and I don't know if this place is nonsmoking but the 2 times I've been there I haven't smelled smoke at all.  

Can anyone else confirm whether this location is non-smoking?

All in all I like this place but you may want to avoid it if you're in a rush to be anywhere (like to catch a plane for instance...)"}
{"text":"I visited this place the weekend after it first opened - this is the only sports bar close to my house and I wanted to try it out. I've heard a lot of people complain that the smoking and eating areas are not separated from each other, but when I was there, there was barely any smoke at all. There are several televisions all around the restaurant with various sports playing. 
On the drinks, they are still fairly new so there weren't a lot of choices to choose from. But I tried the Golden Hefeweizen where you get to choose between a 16 oz or a 24 oz glass. We also tried the pizza as well, which was really good. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best PTs in town. I went here for a Paintnite event w/ my girl friend and the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and always made sure we were taken cared of. I've been to a Paintnite event before; at a different venue but by far PTs hosted it better b/c of their wonderful hospitality. I will definitely come back here on a regular night."}
{"text":"Best PTs in town!
I checked out happy hour with my husband and we had a great experience. The place just opened up and it still smells like fresh paint. It's a little smaller than the other PTs in town but hey the size doesn't matter. We sat at the bar and our bartender (who was awesome by the way) was Dan. We ordered the Gilroy pizza and some other apps and everything came out in a timely manner. With the amount of food and the drinks we ordered, nothing beats the happy hour price. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a local hang out."}
{"text":"Sunday morning decided to come here for 1/2 off breakfast, pretty good deal! Food was not too bad. Very chill atmosphere in the morning. But if you arent a big fan of smoking and or the smell this isnt the place to be, but the staff were friendly and constantly asking how we were doing! Would definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"We started going to PT's when it first opened and absolutely loved it and Ashley the bartender!  Since she left and now manages her own store, the quality of customer service has declined significantly.. starting with Rachel!  We went in the other night to watch the Golden Knights and play video poker, there was 2 machines not in use when we asked what the deal was, Rachel said \"they're being saved, they just went to the bank to get money\"!  So I said \"oh I can call up and save a machine for me huh?!\"  She says \" all I know is they are going to drop a ton of money in them!\"  Mind you, these were not the .25 cent minimum machines, these were the nickel machines!!  So after we questioned her about the machines she had one of the other bartenders take care of us and wouldn't even make eye contact or conversation the 2 hours we were there!  She is very rude and not friendly at all unless of course you're dropping a ton of money!!     We will more than likely won't be back!"}
{"text":"Jodi and the gang have done nothing less than make me feel like the most important person in the room.  I can say enough great things about these people and this bar.  Thank you Jodi.  Y'all are the best."}
{"text":"It's good place to go if you're looking for a local bar to hangout. My husband and I usually meet our friends here for a couple of drinks and chill for an hour or two. The last time we came here our sever was very kind to us (I wish I remembered her name, but it was last Saturday night around 11:30pm and we were seated at a table by the bar). PT's has happy hour at 12am and I would defiantly recommend getting the Gilroy since their pizzas are 50% off."}
{"text":"Tonight I waited for 20min the bartender came looked at me then ask the ppl beside me if they were ok. I asked for a bar and she kept walking. I sat there and waited till I decided to go to BUFFALO WILD WING where the service is better. This place is SAD. I prefer my BAR with a little more life and great service, just saying."}
{"text":"This place deserves two stars because of their great happy hour (half priced drinks and pizza from 5pm-8pm), and the thrid star for their pool tables and arcade games. It does not deserve the other two stars because the staff is rude, and the food is hit or miss, although the pizza is always pretty tasty. They also have the video poker, and other gambling games avaliable at the bar, which is a good or a bad thing, I was kicked off the bar a few times by the rude bartender because I was not gambling and someone else wanted to. Pt's is a good alternative to the hip, trendy bars on the strip."}
{"text":"Decided to give this location a try since the outside & area looked very nice. My fiancé and I were craving their chicken tenders so we stopped by. We got here at 5:30 & lucky for us it was happy hour 50% off drinks. Our waiter Christina was great very attentive customer service higher than I expected for a bar. The chicken tenders cooked perfectly curly fries amazing & drinks. I highly recommend this place. This will be our go to spot for now on. Also the decor was very nice & clean place."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place terrible food service and the draft beer is served warm. Portions are small with no flavor. Staff is clueless to customers. I'm disappointed because I live in the neighborhood and hoped for a good pub that was close by."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch with our in-laws here.  We both ordered steak and eggs with the steak rare.  Almost 20 minutes after we order our server stops by to tell us our food is coming out soon. About 10 minutes later 3 of the 4 meals arrive.  The 4th, a salad, takes another 10 minutes to arrive.  Instead of rare the steaks are well done.  My wife's potatoes are burnt and mine are under done.  The toast was burned and there was no jelly for it.  By the time the server came back the toast was pretty cold.  We told the server about the issues and 10 minutes later she comes back and says the manager is out the cook is new and by himself. But she called the manager and he said to give us coupons for a free appetizer.   She took the meals back and took them off the bill since we hadn't eaten them. Turns out the coupons are for a buy one get one deal not free.  We left hungry and wasted over an hour.  I've ordered this at other PTs and Sierra Gold and it was great.  The PTs sucks.  I'd avoid it unless you just want a drink."}
{"text":"Overall our experience was lousy I don't understand how anyone has had a good experience with this \"place of establishment\" more in particularly there bartender Caesar...I have been to this Pt's a few times and had decent experiences none good to be honest but will go with decent however tonight was the worst night of all!!! my wife and I showed up to the bar around 6:30 for dinner a little gambling and a few beers we put roughly 30$ a piece into our machines and got 2 beers and chicken parm sliders the beers were great as always but as we were playing I noticed Caesar was being a little to comfortable with customers cursing at them and giving them a hard time bullshitting with them and saying stuff way out of context childish jokes ect super unprofessional but I didn't take it to heart I just figured he was super comfortable with his job and that's just the way it is around here when my wife and I went to cash out it took him nearly 15 mins to give us our hand pay as he couldn't stop talking to his friends/co workers? Who were off and were sitting at the end of the bar when he gave us our money he shorted us a nickel and when I called him out on it he stated \"are you serious your worried about a nickle?\" I let it slide and laughed it off as he \"compt\" us two more beers before our first round was finished so I was like oh cool man nice gesture...wasn't the case welp the 30$ I put in the machine turned into 42.75$ and he didn't like that to much apparently so he thought it would be appropriate to charge us for our next round that we did not ask for in the first place the round in which he gave us without our Consent so appon getting our bill I noticed that the beers he handed us were on the check I asked what's up man those are not compt my wife lost 25$ and I put in 30$ to start and another 42$ the second time around and lost 33$ and he tells me very rudely and I quote...\"what you just think your gonna come in here and get free drinks??\" And I was like no but you have to state that we are being charged for drinks before you start handing us over beers we didn't order lol
He says to us never come back to this bar blah blah blah I would not recommend going to this bar Caesar is just the worst lousy bartender nasty mouth caters to friends and stays on his cell phone slow as all hell and short changes you every time I'll never go back to this pts again and I never do this but my wife and I will be contacting the district manager for how unprofessional and (excuse my language) shitty his services were he honestly has a stick up his ass and thinks he's hot shit cause he \"bartends\" at pts lol definitely still lives at home haha thanks for listening!!"}
{"text":"Decent bar food, bartenders are really nice and always put the football games I like to watch on the tv."}
{"text":"updating my review because that bartender I based my last review on isn't at this location anymore. 

this place is a good neighborhood bar. the bartenders are really nice. Michael and James are both really good bartenders. they remember our drinks and are just chill people to talk to :) 

the food is good for bar food, we like the order the gilroy pizza, wing & chili cheese tots, and steak nachos! 

it's a pretty stocked bar, so order anything! these boys can do it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The setting, the remodeling , all the waitresses other then this one chick named Liz she is very just unhappy . Not one smile, knows the menu the back of her hand so reads it off as if she's a recording. When ordering with her you just feel like you are imposing on her. When really we are the ones paying. Witnessed her being very unpleasant to other customers. One of the other customers said,\" she's rude!\" Like she will be the one to push away customers. This location is so prime and such a great atmosphere that you can't have people like her working here. It kills the whole vibe."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time as it is walking distance from our new home. We were looking for a place with good food and limited smoke . PTs did not disappoint - you can't beat the $5 beer and the sandwiches we ample and tasty. Our waitress checked back regularly and the atmosphere was just right for a post work week wind down"}
{"text":"They are still working out the kinks but the server Chris and manager steve went out of their way to make up for it. The drinks were great and the quesadilla was good. My girlfriend and I will be regulars. Happy to have pts in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a couple of games and had a good time. There was a good crowd here to watch the final Golden Knights game vs the Kings. The whole place seems to be kept up pretty well. There was one bartender and one server for a big crowd, so the service wasn't the fastest. They were both working hard, so I can't knock them. I ordered the Royale with Cheese. The burger is stacked high, so there is no way you can eat it without making a mess. I enjoyed both the burger and the fries. Next time, I'll probably get a single burger, though. Overall, I had a good experience so I can't complain. I'm sure I'll be back for another game."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times since it opened and it's a great go-to spot for a quick bite. I live down the road so I appreciate having a good restaurant close by. The Turkey Rachel sandwich is amazing! If you're not sure what to get, you can't go wrong here. I also love how clean it is here, hoping it stays that way!"}
{"text":"Nice new bar with that new bar smell. Food is typical bar food, nothing fancy, but fills the spot. Bar is really nice, with lots of TVs and friendly staff. My only complaint was that I gambled $40, but only got comped 1 beer."}
{"text":"Had to update my review based on our Christmas Day experience here. We were looking forward to coming here to watch the Warriors game. Unfortunately, as soon as we arrived the rude bartender yelled that there were no servers, so he told us to sit at the bar. We sat in a booth and walked up to the bar and ordered. The guy had a real bad attitude, was short with everyone and was just plain rude. He acted like everything was a bother, and that he was crazy busy. At this time there were about 7 people in the bar. We couldn't watch the game with sound and the ventilation in this brand new building is poor. There were only a few people smoking, but the smoke was strong. We stayed because there was no where else to go within walking distance. Later a female bartender came in, she was pleasant and brought our drinks to the table. I'm guessing someone must have said something to the rude guy, because later he suddenly had a personality transplant and started being real polite.

We've been here several times since it opened. We've had one great experience, several average and one bad, which was the above. The only reason I will come back because this place is close to home. I wouldn't come here to eat great food, because the food like all PT's Gold is not that good. However, I like the TVs and a nice new bar within walking distance of my house. I will just pick my nights."}
{"text":"Very poor service and treatment of locals. Beware of this location"}
{"text":"Beware of PT's ...... One star is to much for most locations, Crappy service.  Dirty bathrooms.  Cold food brought out at separate times than my friends food.   This place is awful."}
{"text":"$9 pitchers, and 50% off drinks happy hour. $5 pool, what more can you want? Purely empty on a Monday, good and bad. Will update experience later."}
{"text":"Can't really review the food because not a single employee acknowledged us when we walked in. There was a sign to Seat Yourself, so we sat in the patio area right in view of the bar area. Waited approximately 10 minutes and still no acknowledgement that we were even in the building. So we left. 

It's a little disappointing because I've been to other PTs and I know they have good food and I've never had a problem with service, and this one has kind of ruined it. 

Is it too much to ask for someone who works there to at least acknowledge your presence? Apparently so.... But no worries, I won't be bothering them again."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! this new PTs is located on Buffalo and Warm Springs in SW.
When i opened the door i wasn't sure i wanted to enter the Pub because of the strong smell of smoke (I have asthma...)
I entered anyway, i was starving!
the place was very open and well decorated, Modern and homey..
Feel like a chalet in Aspen 
I ordered some wings with sweet potatoes fries, and monkey ordered some boneless mild buffalo wing with curly fries 
my wings were crispy, delicious! service was fast 
they do not offer the option to select only flap or drums :) (we killed the wings lol nothing left)
I expected some homemade Ranch like at Hooters or Wingstop :(
they sell Pepsi sodas no Coke 
waitress was very pleasant and very friendly!
seating area offers tables, bar or couches!! Love their lights fixtures very modern
good experience 5mns from home
Next time if we decide to drink we might just walk there!"}
{"text":"When we walked in we asked the server right away, Diana, If they still applied a 20% discount for Wynn employees. She immediately replied, \"Yes we do!\" We were there celebrating a friends birthday and wouldn't have ordered anything off happy hour if this situation hadn't occurred... The service was okay, she came every so often to check on us and took our drink orders but seemed confused at some moments. I tried to clarify things for her but she did not take the initiative to repeat our order. We always have a good time at this location so didn't expect what would happen. At the end of the night the bill didn't add up. We approached Diana and asked her if she had applied the 20% discount and she exclaimed, oh shit! And ran to the kitchen to do some kind of investigating. She came back out a few minutes later with a post it that wrote MGM 640 and told us that they no longer had the Wynn code in the system. We showed her the wynn employee site that clearly stated PTs offered it and she said that she would try to contact management. I overheard her speaking to the bartender that there was no way to reopen the check or whatever. She said that she was just waiting for a text from the assistant manager. We waited for 30 mins. She then finally told us there was nothing she could do at the moment (BS because clearly she had some type of power if there was an MGM 20% she could have applied to us) she then told US!!! to call on Monday and ask for the GM KAYLA and tell her about the situation. She did not ask to take our information down or offer to contact us, whatsoever. Being in customer service I have never been so disappointed! Granted it is only $12-$14 being returned to us but it is the principal that matters and she did not for one moment show any type of sympathy for her mistake. I am only giving one star because I heard at least one \"I apologize\". I will not be returning to this location ever, even if it is only 5 mins away, I will gladly drive a few mins more just to feel appreciated."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was terrible our waitress kept forgetting everything then while more than half of the table was eating one person is still waiting for is there food and we asked about it and she completely forgot that he ordered something completely unbelievable then on top of that had to wait almost 15 minutes for our check I don't know if there is enough workers here or she was just that slow!"}
{"text":"The food is absolute shit!  Yuck!  Great bartender and if you're looking for a drink in a smoky atmosphere and gaming good for you!  The boneless chicken fingers (how can you fuck those up) were just gross!  Eat before you come here or go to Buffalo Wild Wings to eat first!  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Great to see Pts took our advise and they have two waitresses working today.Both are very  friendly and the cook is just as nice!! Makes a big difference when the waitresses aren't stressed out! Great food and excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Let's  start with Tiff the bartender. Over an hour at playing keno with a friend. My friend ordered a drink redbull and vodka within the first 15 min she was finished. We continued to play and when it was all said and done I'm leaving and Tiff tells me that the redbull she comped but the shot of vodka  I needed to pay for.  Now I'm no bar manager but how does one split a mixed drink into two bills. I don't understand and I'm not impressed  what so ever. Thanks Tiffany for making my experience there so amazing..."}
{"text":"PT's is overall a great little chain of bars food throughout the Valley.  The have a location on almost every major street at some point or another.  PT's delivers your full-bar and draft brews along with a nice list of both starter items and full entrees."}
{"text":"For those that may be new to Pt's it's you classic neighborhood pub that can be found in almost any Vegas neighborhood. 

I'm found of this Pt's because of its close proximity to my house, shuffle board, good bar food, pool tables, and bar staff."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on st. Patrick's day. Place wasn't even half full and we waited 30 minutes and still no one took our drink order or greeted us. Made eye contact with the bar tender and even gave him a wave. The hint was not noticed. All in all it's a great place to sit and sober up."}
{"text":"Amanda is great! She is a great server and is so funny! I can't wait to come back and have her be my server again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for some bar food! Customer service not so good. Ordered food to go lean mean protein that was supposed to have 2 chicken breasts but only had one. Called back to ask what happened and no one knew why or even tried to fix the issue. Monica the manager never called back or even responded. Employees said she is busy but will get back to you. Buuuuuuttttt she never did of course. The two bartenders were clueless as well on what they were doing. Guess I'm going back to distill right nextdoor. Food is good here but service not so good."}
{"text":"Great bar for gaming and food. Fun graveyard staff. Golden tee and pool here. Come in and ask for Jeff!"}
{"text":"Like other yelpers said about 5--6 other customers. The beer is not as chilled as you want it to be but they have about 20 beers on tap according to the bartender. The pizza was a bit undercooked and tasted like other PTs. The Place needs a good cleaning especially the floors. If it was bustling I would understand but was slow. The saving grace of this location is the great view of the planes landing."}
{"text":"I came our with friends to have a few drinks and have a good time, only to be met with the WORST server we've ever encountered. She had an awful attitude and asked to see our ID's every time she came back even though it was literally the same people from the start. At the end, we asked to split the bill between each other and she actually said \"I don't have time for that\". Definitely won't be back to this PT's."}
{"text":"They don't reward players. Was told I get 1 comped draft beer per 20$. But then didn't comp my beer at all or any drinks I had. Also dirty pads on the bathroom all night long."}
{"text":"Seriously, worst bartender service ever. Who hired this girl to be a bartender. Grow some personality and do your job. April 23 @ 6:30 PM...fire this girl, seriously.

Consistently poor food at this location.  The price for what you get is not worth it.  I'm not sure I'd consider dining here even if it was half off.  Take for instance my last lunch meal:  chicken quesadilla and an ice-tea; nearly 20 bucks BEFORE tip!  Far better options in the area for food and better service. It's too bad really as the location is in the same complex as our work.  If they brought in some people who cared about service and redid the menu to not appeal to the lowest common denominator we would be regulars here Monday through Friday.  Until then, we will continue to drive right on past."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it was not a good one. We walked in and were not greeted by any of the 4 people working there. After we sit down, the waitress takes our order. I ordered a double vodka Sprite and was served a single. Didn't see our waitress for awhile and we decided to leave after one drink. Flagged her down for the check, which she charged me for a double, and then she disappeared. After 10 minutes I walked up to the bar to cash out and they asked me to wait for her. My friend put cash in and I put my card.....tell me why when someone else FINALLY cashed us out everything was charged to my card and they left the money?! Needless to say I will not be coming back to this location. 

Also, I heard the 2 waitresses talking about boxing up someone's leftovers for themselves. Gross."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood \"Go To\" hang out.  

Service is great - food is amazing.  You  haven't lived until you've eaten their chili cheese fries. Seriously.  All the food is good.  Even the hot pretzel bites, just for something plain and simple. DE-lish!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom and my sister. We intended to play pool but wanted to get some food first. We sat down at a table and were greeted by a waitress named Jazmyn. She kindly cleaned the table and took our orders. Mom, sis and I had good conversations and we were patiently waiting for our food. A \"little\" later the waitress comes and says \"your food will be out shortly\". We say \"thank you\" but then noticed that we actually had been waiting for 40 minutes. 10 minutes later we were really getting annoyed and were then trying to find our waitress but couldn't find her. A total of ONE hour of waiting we decided to leave. I end up finding the waitress and tell her that we are leaving because we shouldn't have to wait for an entire hour for the food we ordered (a burger, nacho plate, and sliders). Oh, and by the way,  the restaurant was more empty than full so you would think that they'd have time to care for their existing customer a bit more. Anyway, when I told the waitress that we are leaving she just said \"ok\" and didn't seem to care as she quickly turned around and walked away from me. 
 I could have accepted this wait if the staff handled it better and had a good explanation/reason. This was not the case which is why I'm giving them a 1 star."}
{"text":"This place is a joke that obviously has no problem turning away potential customers. We stopped in this morning for a bite to eat with one of our daughters. Yes there is a gaming section in this establishment but there's also a separate dining area not even close to the gaming part. Apparently kids are not welcome to even eat in here. Even in a booth! Good customer service, huh? Good luck lasting long in a family based area of the city. There's plenty of other options. We will never be giving this place a penny of our money!!"}
{"text":"I used to drive by this place a lot and it never really caught my eye, but my boyfriend recently visited another branch and liked it, so we decided to give this place a try. We were happily surprised by the place! It has a great ambiance inside, the server was prompt and attentive, and food and drinks were really good! Really glad we stopped by!"}
{"text":"Check in for a free bevvie :)

Bar / Comfort type grub.
There's TVs so you can catch the latest game.
They have a separate area for video poker around the bar. This area also allows smoking so if you don't want to be in the smoking area... just sit on the other side of the glass/wall.
Their menu includes burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas... ya know... bar food.
I go here occassionally to grab a drink with Mom or a burger.  
We like their burgers.  They are juicy and messy and oh-so-tasty.
They aren't huge monstrosities like some places so you can actually finish it and not feel like you're going to explode.
Service has always been good.
The gals working have always been \"on it\" and nice.
Overall... a good \"go to place\" to meet up with friends over a beer.

If you didn't read the first line... Check in on Yelp.  I highly recommend it.  :)"}
{"text":"There are many bars crowded around the area I live in. This, by far, is my favorite one. The bartender Mike is the best. Always friendly. Always funny. Always high energy. This is the place I usually end up late-late night/super early morning. The HOT chicken fingers and fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"With only 6-7 patrons in house, service can be a little faster.....if I was regular, I think service would have been better. Or perhaps if the bartender wasn't on his cell phone so much, it could've been a pleasant experience....,"}
{"text":"I spent New Years Eve here because of the extended happy hour. As always the drinks and food are amazing. I've been to this location twice and I believe this will be my last time coming. The blonde bartender was by far the rudest and took for ever for her to serve you. She would glance over but it seemed like she tried to avoid our group as much as possible. We were waiting to buy drinks not just one either but many and it seemed impossible to achieve. I will stick to the ones I know where they're friendly and willing to keep our drinks filled."}
{"text":"I can put up with a lot of crap, mostly because I've discovered that Las Vegas is NOT a customer service town.  You disagree with me?  Well, then...I have two words for you.  Automatic Gratuity.  In my opinion, no matter what the size of the party, gratuity should not be an automatic thing, waitresses are paid a flat wage for what they do and whatever they make in tips is a reflection of their customer service skills.  Regardless, I'm MORE THAN willing to forgive less than stellar food or products if the customer service was good.  In fact, amazing customer service will probably prompt me to return to a location despite any issues I may have with food or drinks.  This is not the case with this location, and as the rude manager, Chris, informed me...I'll be the first negative Yelp that their location receives, despite the fact that, presently, the past Yelps are on my sidebar and I see two 2 star reviews already...without even looking further.  

I went to this location with a work party on Friday night.  We had a pretty large group and were greeted by a waitress we had dealt with before, Emily.  Now, the first time we dealt with her, she made it a point to tell us that it was her first night there and while the service wasn't great, it was understandable with a new job.  In that time, her confidence must have skyrocketed because she was a bit belligerent on Friday night, but also seemed very much overwhelmed.

As she was placing down some of the food that had been ordered, my office manager approached her and said...\"Hi, when you're finished, I'd like to order another drink.\"  Seems like a normal bar request, right?  Apparently not as Emily barely spared her a glance and loudly replied, \"Ok, honey...well, I'm the only waitress on staff and you'll need to wait.\"  I'm sorry, to speak to a grown woman like she's a child and you're her parent, are you kidding me?!

My manager sat back down, looked at me and said...\"I'm ready to go, I won't be drinking anything else.\"  Sure enough, when Emily FINALLY came back to our table, my manager waved her off and muttered something about her customer service skills.  Actually, most of the night, my manager spoke to the members of her staff that had shown up about how rude Emily was or muttered straight to her about something that had further annoyed her.  To cap off our night with Emily, we took a tally when everyone was leaving.  A grand total of THREE ordered drinks never made it back to the people that had ordered.  A+, honey!

It was at this point that I pulled out my phone to start a Yelp about what had happened.  The only problem was, there's more than one PT's location down Hualapai, so when Emily came back, I asked her what the address was for our location.  She didn't know.  Furthermore, another waitress didn't know.

When the manager finally showed up to confront my office manager about HER attitude, it ended with a verbal altercation where she stood up and said she was leaving.  I can only supposed that he NEEDED to get the last word in, so he told her...\"please do!\"  I'm unsure if he really cared, wanted to save face or just rub salt in the wound, but he then approached the remaining people in our party, shook hands and asked about their experience.  I approached him, explained that my manager was understandably pissed off, but that I was calm and willing to explain what had happened to put her in that state.  He not only seemed less than apologetic when I told him what Emily had said, but assured me that nobody had ever complained about her and that she worked at three locations.  

Finally, I told him that two of his waitresses didn't even know the address and that they should be further trained.  Again, he reiterated that they worked at several PT's around the area and I replied that when I was 18, I had been employed at three jobs to get by and could have told anybody the addresses and phone numbers of each location.  He seemed to scoff a bit at my make believe world of actually knowing where you're employed and I asked him what would happen if somebody called to get the location?  He replied that his staff was trained to tell anybody that calls that the nearest crossroad was Flamingo/Hualapai...which is actually half a mile away from this location.  I replied to him that he should know that most GPS systems don't operate on crossroad instructions, but rather an actual address.

Once again, I'm unsure how I'm supposed to move on from this experience when this is clearly the only bar in Las Vegas.  Where else am I supposed to go to watch sports or get a drink or enjoy good food.  Wait, excuse me?  There's a Buffalo Wild Wings on the other side of Flamingo/Hualapai?  I won't smell like a cigarette factory when I leave there?  Emily and Chris don't work there?  Well, why didn't you say so before?!  Thank you for the memories, PT's, sorry I had to grace you with your first negative review."}
{"text":"Came here after class for some drinks with friends. Tons of seating and TVs, really good service and a good selection of drinks. Half off drinks & pizzas during happy hour (specialty cocktails not included) as well as $5 appetizers. We didn't get any food but maybe next time.

My friends ordered beers while I settled for a mango something drink. Not sure what was in it but it was on the sweet side & pretty good. I finished it rather quickly. I'll definitely be ordering the same thing on my next visit. 

Victoria was our server and she was great. She checked in on us frequently and constantly refilled our waters."}
{"text":"More of a corporate review as employees here are great. Is it me or has PT's tightened their machines beyond belief? Can't even hit 4 of a kinds playing perfect strategy which means machines have been adjusted to 90% or below payback. 

Stopped into my local \"Sports Bar\" tonight to find out they haven't subscribed or paid for the PAC12 Network on DirecTV. This makes ZERO sense since we live basically on the west coast. PT's has not gone down hill they are rolling and sprinting downhill. Once the Gold Standard for Vegas they are quickly turning into a joke. Can't  be in a city where 90% of population works in the customer service industry and you think they won't notice the \"small\" changes you have made. 

Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!   The food is amazing and he video poker gives me a fighting chance.    Their internet is outstanding  as well great staff. Great viewing."}
{"text":"Horrible service, got told we couldn't get drinks directly from the bar and that our waitress would handle our groups drink orders and we literally had to go looking for our waitress several times and the drinks were weak"}
{"text":"I am excited about PT'S Gold opening close to home.
I am impressed with the professional staff, tasty food, and gaming when I dare.
I recommend this place to anyone 21 years and older.  A great place to relax and unwind."}
{"text":"Nonexistent service. Once we sat down and ordered 2 beers it took 30 minutes. Same to just get water. Ordered food and it took nearly an hour. Once it came out the chicken wings were burnt and the pizza fries were soggy. Had to ask several times for silverware.

The table next to us totally left without paying their tab because it was impossible to get service. The waitress would disappear in the back and rarely emerge. When she did she would do a quick lap around the dining room without stopping and go back into the kitchen...

Another table that had come in and sat down left after about 20 minutes due to being completely ignored. No drinks, nada.

This is a bummer because this place had potential to be a good local spot, but the service is so so so so bad. We will never be back. No matter, there are plenty of other places to go nearby."}
{"text":"Everything is just ok even if your hungry. Service is suspect. The daytime bartender (Heidi) won't change the channel on both of the tv's in front of me because one customer requested both tv's first. I'm glad he didn't request all the tv's in the place. Come on Heidi think for your self."}
{"text":"Home of the terrible French Dip. It was made with philly steak, not sliced beef. Seasoned to taste like a Philly Steak sandwich. Service was put off by bartender Rebecca. She asked if she could get us anything else, I said ranch dressing, and she said \"I was talking to him\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic location near west 215/Russell by the hospital.  We meet here 2X every month for our networking leads group. Gotta love 1/2 price happy hour 5-7 daily!"}
{"text":"For a brand new bar, this place sucks. The female bartenders ignore anyone who isn't blond like them.  We have been here a few times just because it's close to home and always hope for it to get better but it never ever does. The girls ALWAYSSSS Play depressing music. Come on... it's a brand new bar, let's get with the new age to match the beautiful new bar. I just hate that it has come down to leaving a bar review because the service and female servers suck. I'm sorry but I will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Kayla had my beers coming through all night and made sure I wasn't thirsty. It's a new plane so there's no smoke, and they'll play any game you want! Go Knights!!!!"}
{"text":"It's sports bar and I went for happy hour, not expecting too much. Drinks were cool and I decided to get some nachos. The nachos were great until I found hair in them. It really wasn't a big deal, it happens so I just sent them back. It's an ok spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Starr, Charlie, and Dan are the best bartenders you'll ever meet! They always go above and beyond! The bar has a great atmosphere with 99% locals and is very much a comfortable neighborhood bar. I can't say enough great things about THIS pts and it definitely doesn't feel like a chain. So glad I live in anthem and get to call pts with Starr, Charlie, and Dan my local bar!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! We've given them multiple chances, but they just can't seem to pull it off. 

The first time we went there, my husband went up to the bar and exchanged his ID for the rack of balls to shoot pool, so they knew we were there. I ended up getting on their website and complaining while we were still there, after we had waited more than 20 minutes and still had not had anyone take our drink order.

The next morning, I received a very nice email from their corporate office offering an apology and requesting that we come back and enjoy a complimentary evening, which we did, and things were better, but of course they knew we had complained.

We went back a week later (Friday nights out are a regular thing for us), and the service was horrible again.

We returned a few months later, just to be fair. No change. Again about six months after that, the same. I felt we gave it our due diligence, and honestly wish it were better. Our search for a nice \"weekly hang-out\" with pool tables in our general area continues."}
{"text":"Well this USED to be a great location with excellent service. Alas, the winds of change blew through this place like a tornado. 

While we were very happy for the old manager, Jason, when he got promoted to corporate, the place just took a huge dump after he left and never recovered.

It just doesn't instill much confidence when you see the cook leaving the men's room with a toilet plunger in his hand and still wearing his apron! Eeeeew! 

One would also expect a bar with a female manager and female waitresses to have a reasonably clean ladies' room, as they all use it too. But the ladies' room is always filthy. 

New manager chick also needs a class in customer service. Making sure everyone can see your little boobies might get you some mileage with the male customers, but I have my own boobs. I can look at them whenever I want. Yours do not impress me, and they do not make up for your poor service skills."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this location. We try to make here at least once a week if we can. It her convenient as it's down the street from where we live. It's a great place to grab a drink and a good meal. We have out favorite waitress, her name is Amanda and she is awesome. Amanda is always so warm and welcoming and always has a beautiful smile on her face. We also have a bartender that makes amazing drinks, his name is Don and he is also the assistant manager. Just tell Don what you're looking for and he'll make a drink you'll never forget. Thank you Don and Amanda for being amazing."}
{"text":"Dj was great! Super friendly! The bar is amazing love the whole vibe def will be coming back ! Got the spinach dip was so bomb ! Dj recommended it again he was so great. So was surdy and the general manager ! Will be back."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited PT's around midnight on a Friday night. We had beer and enjoyed the pool table. The atmosphere here was really cozy - rustic, classic rock music, and accommodating staff. My only rant is that the pool table is not kept cleaned. We asked for a table brush and cleaned it ourselves. One of the pool sticks needed to be replaced as well. All in all, we had a good experience here, and we'll continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"I went in to watch the NBA Finals. It's the third time I've been in there in five days. This time I ordered the popcorn chicken buffalo pizza. It was awful. I ate one piece and sent it back. Now, I didn't ask for it to be taken off my check or a discount, but I figured they would do something. However, they charged me the full price for the pizza and just gave me a coupon for \"buy one get one free\" appetizer. It was a pretty pathetic response. There are far too many options around here, so, it will be a while before I go back. Don't order the popcorn chicken pizza."}
{"text":"The overweight cook who brought us our food was very rude. He threatened to drop our food on the floor for not telling him who ordered the mild wings fast enough. Don't go here if you want to be treated like a respected customer."}
{"text":"I frequent this bar at least once a week. I've always felt welcome and treated like one of the family. Great food, friendly staff, great environment. The genie wizard computer jerk won't let me win at blackjack though... Not their fault. Lol"}
{"text":"This PT's is walking distance from my house and I love that they put this one right here! Not that there aren't about 5 more on the way lol they have a ton of locations and it just doesn't get better than having one you can walk to! That way you don't have to worry about drinking and driving! Ha! So yeah as much as I just talked about how excited I am that it's close doesn't mean I come here very often! I believe I've been here about 3 times and each time it was a pretty decent experience! Happy hour is of course the best and most peak hour to visit!"}
{"text":"PT's Gold is always a must every now and then when I want to enjoy a late night happy hour with my co-workers! This has been a tradition for maybe the past few years where we all meet up for a great night of catching up, playing pool, drinking and stuffing our faces with yummy bar food. 

This location was recently remodeled because my most recent experience last week I noticed all of the changes inside the place. Newer flat screen TV's on the wall and a more open concept around the bar! Before this location was a bit unsatisfactory when it came to the bar scene because if you were the person who choose to be seated at the bar anybody who walked behind you would have to squeeze past you literally and brush up against you. Weird right? Well all that is gone because the high table tops allow for more space and you can now fit more people at the tables. They also use to have couches which I actually liked but for whatever reason they have now removed those.. Interesting... 

Our server was probably one of the coolest that we have ever received! Super chill, attentive and gave some great recommendations on some new things to try out! The pool tables are still the same and we lucked out on getting a table on a busy Saturday night! Overall great changes and some things still remain like the security guard that sits at the door and cards you. So just an FYI for all those people underage you will not PASS GO! To everyone else.. Well.. Enjoy! :-)"}
{"text":"This is me & gf's new local spot! We go in just to see Monica. She is always so accommodating best bartender ever and she's hot too! Dan js cool & Kari is the sweetest too. Food on point, service on point. 5 stars all the wayyy"}

Kristine was great friendly and very good can't wait to tell all of are friends to go there 
Thanks

{"text":"PT's Bar and Grill is a fun place to go if you want to grab a drink and watch a game or play some pool. It's definitely not the cheapest bar in town almost makes you feel like you're closer to the strip and not in the suburbs but nevertheless it's a nice place with lots of room to kick back and hang out with friends. They have actual dart boards with actual darts so that's a lot of fun to play cricket and the other dart games with my boyfriend. They have 3 pool tables which have several TVs around them so I can watch something while the guys play pool. 

Steve is the late night bartender and and he is normally on top of it making sure you don't have to wait more than a minute or so. They don't pour very heavy at any PT's bar I've been to and this one is no exception."}
{"text":"Average food, exactly what you'd expect for bar food (ordered the quesadilla app- nothing to come back for)- but the decor is impressive and the staff tonight is GREAT. Drinks surpass the food- but we admittedly just had appetizers. Minimal smoke tonight, so we got lucky- I wouldn't peg this as a craft beer location, but the happy hour and proximity to where I live are ideal! Good TV location- I'd come back for football games! I LOVE there's area of the bar with no games... we always sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Golden State wins and Ashley is awesome! See ya next time! Best Cajun wings and sliders. Love the Happy Hour is great when your watching the game and drinking Blue Moon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is amazing, the food was good! Plus, it's very close to where I live. They offer a loyalty card that emails you discounts, which is an incentive to be back soon. Overall, we had a great experience. It's great this place opened, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come into this bar only when Monica is working because she is amazing! She is the best bartender ever!"}
{"text":"The service was really good and the happy hour was awesome.

The food was delish, though I am surprised the cost of bar pizzas these days.. It's not gourmet pizza but it sure is good. I remember when a large was $12 now its hard to find any \"decent\" pizza under $20... I just aged myself

Drinks.. decent selection and good happy hour 

Mix of clientele.. all types and ages.. good crowd

Smoke.. poor ventilation if you're a non-smoker you can smell the smoke from across the room

The music is the worst part of this establishment...it's F'n atrocious (music).. you really need to allow your customers to pick the music not your bartenders.. add a jukebox so the customers can battle royal for the next song.. I'd  pay the extra $.50 to stop what was playing. The bar is surrounded by western style art but heaven forbid you play one country song or one metal or rock song.. it was literally on the Sirius radio Justine Bieber station.. we wanted to stay but couldn't stand the music so we left and went to another bar"}
{"text":"Brand new beautiful location, the service is another thing. Carlos on grave is by far the best tender in this location. Can't judge too hard because it's new but will keep coming back bacause i'm not an asshole & judge on the first 2 times in.
 Maybe after the 3rd time  also a better vetilation system, 6 seats away is someone smoking that smells like they're sitting on my lap. 

Update 3/16/18. Walk in to the right of the bar. Still stinks as if someone smoking was sitting on your lap even though the person smoking is 5 seats away.

4/13/18 i really like coming here, all the bartenders are great..but the damn ventilation still needs to be looked at, i've gone to pt's bars that are way way older than this one & it still doesn't smell like someone is blowing smoke in your face sitting 6 chairs away."}

{"text":"I've been here four times and had great service each time. I was really impressed with the PT's brand beers, especially the IPA. The Happy Hour prices and offerings are good too. Lots of TV's with relevant games on and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here after watching a show on the strip and we wanted to continue having drinks.

I have been a couple of other PT bars but this one was much bigger than the others.

I'm was very spacious and hosted many tables - large screen TVs and the bar was in the epicenter.

As well as having drinks, we ordered pizza and wings and those were surprisingly very good.

This is probably a place we will consider coming back too in the future to have some late night drinks.

{"text":"Visited this PT's for the first time to watch a Knights game. As soon as we walked in Cheyenne greeted us. She was super nice/friendly and helpful.  Most tables were reserved (for the game) but bar and some tables were available. We grabbed unreserved seats and had great service from Dyra the entire time we were there.  Dyra was super friendly and efficient always stopping by at the right time. It got very busy and the staff worked their butts off!  The entire staff was very friendly. They have a really nice outdoor patio environment too.  Ladies room was VERY  clean. People were smoking but there was no smelly  smoke in the place and was not a bother at all and the only reason I mention this is  because I read some reviewers complained about this, nothing could be further from the truth (get over it!)  Vodka and cranberry drink was a decent pour. 5pm to 7pm was happy hour which was 50% off domestic beer, some drinks and appetizers. We had such a good time we  reserved a table to return for the next Knights game and our friends agreed and are returning with us. The menu offered appetizers, burgers, pizza and some entrees like orange chicken,  steak and fish and chips. We only tried  the mozzarella sticks/triangles this time which were very good and look forward to trying more on the menu on our next visit . They had a breakfast menu too."}
{"text":"9/9/16 Friday, Went way out of our part of town as this had good ratings.  So we had to try it ourselves.   They even had live music.    The guy that was playing a guitar and singing I thought was the juke box that's how good he was.   

The food was excellent.  I had the French Dip.  My Mom had White chicken nuggets and tater tots and my sister had fish and chips.   

The service was awesome and they were very tentacle to our needs and made sure we were taken care of.  

They also had no clue that we were Yelp advisors. 

Try them u will like it."}
{"text":"I go to PTs a lot, but this was the first time I went to this location because I happened to be in the area. This location is huge with more pool tables than I'm used to so that was a plus. My server Amanda was great! Even though it was busy she made sure my drink stayed full. She even recommended some of the new happy hour items which I tried (even though I typically stick to my usual). I got the new Gilroy flatbread and potato skins, both of which were really good. Overall it was a great experience and the service was even better. I'll definitely make my way there again."}
{"text":"This place is filthy, take a good look around if you are there. Aside from mopping the floors with dirty water (I've seen them do it) and wiping the bar top down, I don't think the place has ever been cleaned. I've seen in the kitchen too, it's filthy like the rest of it. I guess the owners would rather pocket all of the money rather than pay a few $'s of it to have the place professionally cleaned every now and then.

In the immortal words of John Taffer, \"clean the fu..ing place out\".

I also found this hilarious. I asked the bartender how much the Bud Light I ordered was and she replied, \"I've worked here for 11 years and I still couldn't tell you what they cost, I'll grab the ticket for you\"."}
{"text":"I've been told they're all the same...NOT so much.

There isn't anything wrong with this location, as much as it just isn't as good as others."}

{"text":"Came for the first night of the world series. One waitress for whole place. Ordered a beer at the bar because the waitress was not to be found. It took forever to get the beer. This was about 6pm and it was happy hour. At 630 we ordered 1 more beer. It didn't come to us until 659pm. Happy hour ends at 7. Cmon PTs owners...... you should be packed at these locations. This place is getting worse every day. Same sad pizzas. Same horrible happy hour food. Terrible service. The volume on the tvs in the dining area are broken we were told. We come here all the time and it is just not worth the aggrevation anymore. Btw... bartender was a rude b word too. Waitress was full of nothing but excuses for the bad service."}
{"text":"They have now changed their happy hour. PT's owners must be very greedy. The value goes down, the quality goes down and the prices go up. How in the heck are they paying for all these new locations when they are all empty. The good beers used to be on the happy hour menu. Now you have to pay about $9.00 a beer for the good ones. Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH. Who the hell wants that? The food at PT's sucks! The only decent thing was the good beer. Don't go to these restaurants. They really do suck on all levels. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 7 girls around 9:15am on a Saturday morning to get some food and cocktails after a run. We sat out on the patio. It took literally an HOUR for the first few plates of food to come out. While we were waiting, my friend went back into the bar to order a second round of drinks (which the bartender / server comped off - a nice gesture, but not enough to make up for the lack in service). The part that bothered me the most is that half our group was literally done eating before the last plates of food came out!

The place was EMPTY. They offer half off breakfast until 10am and with college football, I would have expected them to be able to handle a few orders. I'm fairly confident I personally could have sent out seven plates of pancakes and eggs in about half the time so I'm really not sure what took so freaking long. What I do know is that I will not be back!"}

Even during busy rushes and slower times she's always on top of the game and making sure my groups and I are well taken care of. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have to help out this business....I can't understand why the reviews are so BAD. I wish I remembered the bartenders name, he's a muscular guy. Anyway, he was SO friendly and even encouraged me to sign up for their free rewards program, which gave me $5 off my tab. Also, the happy hour specials can't be beat."}

{"text":"Well it's pretty- I'll give it that. It's also pretty small, pretty precocious, and pretty hard to get a drink unless you're regular. No shuffleboard no pool no darts no Golden Tee. Just gamble or watch sports.

Hubby and I went in grabbed? a seat, put a hundred each in the machine and waited for a bartender... She came in 5 minutes and I realize they were busy, so no big deal. We received really weak drinks and a food menu. She could only give us one menu -I guess they were short on menus. 40 min goes by, betting max, no refills and no one asked us what we wanted to order for food. We ran out of money at that point so we got up and the bartender says \"hey no refills?\" Really?!

I can understand if we were not playing max on the machines but we were. In fact there were only 6 gamblers of the less than 20 machines all being occupied. Of course we bailed no tip-never done that in my life....

Unless I'm conned into coming back here by my preppy friends I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pt pubs is not tourist friendly, they are incredibly rude, bad service. One of our friends is visiting from UK and they did not accept his Identification. Declined our party of 15. The bar manager was extremely rude as well and just wanted us out. She didn't let us speak and blamed everything on corporate policy. We regulars but Never coming back to PTs pub."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. Prices are like any bar, the atmosphere is good and the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was pretty gross to be honest. Bar foods either be a hit or miss but unfortunately today it's was a huge L."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that there's a PT's right next to where I live! The food was awesome and everyone that was working was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Waitress didn't come to our table but once and ended up giving our simple beer and shot order to another table. Walked out after food came and we never saw our server...."}
{"text":"I frequent this particular PT's pretty often, as it's the nearest one to my house.  But even if it weren't, I'd still come here.

The first time I came here was during the last March Madness to watch the Rebels play (Go, Fight, Win!).  Sadly, the Rebels did not win the game, but hey, who knows what'll happen this season?  But I digress!  It was packed in the main bar area where the Rebel game was playing, so I meandered my way to the restaurant area to watch the game where some other team's fan had set up shop (I don't remember which one).  My friends and I were obnoxious Rebel fans here and through the yelling, we still got pretty great service, particularly considering how packed they were.

That level of service is standard.  Every time I've gone since then, the servers have been attentive and friendly, and beverages and food have been received in a timely fashion.  I've been here during random weekday happy hours and early Sunday mornings to watch football (Go Cowboys!) and never a waiver from the good service.  Oh and shout-out to Becky as she's an awesome server!

Also, the vibe is relaxed and fun and just overall good.  Since the place is relatively new, there's no smell of stagnant smoke lingering anywhere, and the plethora of TVs is much appreciated.  The crowd, from what I've seen, tends to be in the mid 20s to mid 40s and of the working professional bent.  

I dig this place."}
{"text":"First time here came for the happy hour great food and service, Kristine was my server she was great! Gave great recommendations and my drink was never empty!! Will def be back gonna make this my regular after work hang out!!"}
{"text":"Tvs are little .. Drinks high priced.. Happy hour only 2 hours... Chicken fingers suck.. But pizza is good.."}
{"text":"Live about 5 minutes from this bar and have eaten / drinken on several occasions now. Each time service was slow, and have twice had my order flat out forgotten. Bartenders (including the GM and AGM no less!) have all been extremely unnattentive. They also do not comp for gaming (what city are we in again?). 

All in all, extremely disappointed in the bar and looking forward to it going out of business so someone who knows how to run a bar can move in.

P.s. To the bartender / agm who leaves the same copied and pasted response on every negative review, save your effort and focus on running your bar better."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience, Adam is by far super friendly and funny. Always makes sure youre ok with drinks and def knows how to work a busy bar. Food is good, kitchen staff is also very ontoop of their game. Machines are always clean. They have pool and music videos playing.  Good place for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here multiple times and have never received such terrible service. The bartender didn't do his job by refilling our beers when asked. They charged us for other peoples beers assuming we were all together and refused to remove the beer from the tab and charged our cards for the beers without our consent, stating because we came together that it was assumed to only be one tab...we were never asked if the tab was together or separate and the bartenders Melanie and James were horrible refusing to give us the managers information to dispute the issue. If the policy is one tab it should've been stated prior to us drinking otherwise we should've been asked. And they shouldn't hold us responsible for their failure to collect payment from another patron"}
{"text":"The bartenders Angelique and Lakey are on point. I can't see why all the negative reviews are here. They're great to talk to, personable, and all around great Vegas style bartenders."}
{"text":"Only gets two stars because Wednesday was a great waitress. 
Should get 1 star, I played $40 in the machine before playing pool and yet was still charged for every beer besides one. ( never seen a more stingy joint) we also were charged for 5 hours of pool and only played for four. 
We didn't get any sort of comp when altogether my group gambled $70. 
If you're going to be that stingy about your beers you may lose a customer.
Never had a PTS be so horribly petty. 
Avoid this place if you want decent and fair comps."}
{"text":"Ok so came in here with a few friends for happy hour at midnight, and yes at first site this is a nice bar. They have a lounge area where you can sit in comfort. They have a few pool tables, the place has plenty of room it is pretty big. They have a great bar area with enough tv's to watch the games. So now we went to the bar to order our drinks, and as we waited there patiently to order the bartender passed us a few times. We waived to get his attention to let him know we are ready to order but he still passed us by. When he did finally acknowledge us, he took the order of the people who came in after we did. It took us about 20 minutes to get our drinks. All in all its a nice bar but the service isn't that good."}
{"text":"They upgraded the place, it's really nice. You have more room to sit and play pool. It's a great bar to go with fri9and hang out."}
{"text":"Came here for date with my husband. Got here at 5pm on the dot. Place is clean from where we sat and could see also wasn't busy at all. Biggest mistake to come here. The order of our food were all wrong. Had to wait to get correct orders... also correct appetizer (that we waited for) was cold on the inside. Waitress took it back then brought the same food back. Had my one bite in it and all. Really? Never had that happen before, don't they normally bring a whole new dish? A fly or moth was in my drink and a new one was served but nothing was done to accommodate our waiting time and mistakes dealing with everything. Didn't want a whole free meal, but something to notice their mistakes would have been the correct thing to do. Always have gone to pts and never had issues but this location, seems to not care about their customers. Won't be coming back to this location. Sad thing since I live 5 mins away from here. The kitchen and waitress we had need to get it together. Our waitress pretty much was blaming everything on the kitchen but didn't bluntly say that. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Not a good experience here at all."}
{"text":"Took an hour for our food to come out!  How does mozzarella sticks and fried Mac and cheese take that long??  We received our pizza thirty minutes earlier than the rest of our 'quick' fried food because we got another table's pizza.  I wonder how much longer that would've taken if the mistake didn't happen.  Had high hopes for this bar, but was easily disappointed."}
{"text":"Grand opening day and as expected, it was incredibly busy. Our server, Leontray was very attentive. We ordered the pizza, chicken nuggets, fries, and fish n chips. The pizza was a bit of a disappointment. The flavor wasn't all there for me and a little dry in taste. I usually go to Sierra gold and there pizza is always spot on and piping hot. The chicken nuggets and fish n chips were nothing spectacular, but it's bar food. They had servers walking around handing out samples of their beers every hour or so. They have happy hour that starts at 5pm, that include their pizzas,  selected appetizers and draft beers. They also have another late night happy hour as well. The bar and establishment is clean and the vibe is nice. I like how it doesn't smell like smoke yet. Good job to the management team that trained their staff! Their is ample parking too, so you aren't stressed or driving around like a creeper for 10 min. trying to find parking."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had at a pts in the 9 years I have been in Vegas and we eat at one every Wednesday. The bartender/waitess took about 10 minutes to even come over to our table and there was only one other table in the restaurant.
         She was rude from the get go, when we were ordering she making faces when one of my party was asking questions about what she was ordering. Her facial expression was \"like really, is she serious\", \" is she for real?\"
         I ordered Chipotle wings which I order every week and 3 weeks prior at this location. When my order came out, it was Habanero. I told her that my order was wrong and she said it was the closet thing to what I ordered, like it was my fault. She went and got a menu and opened it infront of me and asked me to show her where on the menu it said chipotle. Trying to make me looks stupid in front of the people i was with. I dont even look at the menu any more i just always order my wings and they come out the way i order them. I get it that they are not on the menu, but she should have said something from the get go insteaded of putting the order in wrong. And then trying to make me feel stupid like it was my fault. 
         On top of that she brought someone else card on my buddies check. And did not have his card. If she hates her job that much she needs to find something different. We will never be back to this location!!"}
{"text":"There are 5 bars within 2 miles from where we live, this one is still our favorite. Why PTs? Aren't they at every corner you may ask? Yes, but service always wins. I've been coming here for a little over 2 years now and all the bartenders are awesome, Ray in particular. He remembers his customers and always pours our drinks before ordering. It's those little details that people can appreciate. 
Great place and atmosphere for an after work drink. You can't beat their happy hour, caters to those working 9-5 or 4-12 everyone wins. Their cooks make their food right, I've had food from different PTs and it's not that great. Their cooks here definitely seem to like what they do. 
Bar has a chill lounge area to catch the football games or any sport, and a few pool tables to mix it up. Come check this place out and ask for Ray if you haven't already. You'll enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"I been here a couple times since it's down the street from my house. I been lucky enough to be waited by Kristine, she is very friendly and knowledgeable. I'm a picky drinker and she always recommends the best drinks! She suggested the nachos with chicken and they were AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Just opened today and based on their service- seems like they've been open and running for years. Clean, friendly, and the quesadilla was delicious. It's going to be a problem that this is walking distance from me!"}
{"text":"As others mentioned this place is a smokey.
Yuck..cough cough.  We just had drinks.  Service at the bar was good."}
{"text":"When you order a French dip one would think au jus would be apart of that. It's super disappointing to pick up a to go order and part of it missing. They need to get better at completing their orders and following through. This is not the only bad experience I have had at this location but it will be my last. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new local bar near my house and I plan on never coming back to this bar. Took awhile to be greeted and we had to ask our server, Lisa, multiple times for our side of buffalo sauce while our food was getting cold. She forgot about a refill on a vodka/soda and didn't check back on us often to see if we were doing well. Needless to say this will be the last bar I will go to near my home."}
{"text":"being so near to me and having a great happy hour (3-7) and playing any NFL/college football game ask about along with a great staff is the reason you will find me here."}
{"text":"This location is brand new so very nice inside, clean, good ambiance, great customer service, tv's throughout entire bar & a nice happy hour, nothing over the top or crazy.

Wasn't too thrilled with the citrus Moscow mile, tasted like watered down sprite with a hint of citrus. My boyfriend & I both got the wings, 1 batch boneless & one batch bone in, BBQ & garlic Parmesan. Pretty tasty!

We'll be back if looking for a late night drink or bite to eat."}
{"text":"So I no longer complain about feeling hustled.  What a difference a couple of years make.  I no longer go visit that friend because he is no longer my friend.  The bartender that I (and others) felt hustled us at the end of our nights is no longer working for the company.  So yes, I make the trek here all the way from Summerlin for a great bloody mary and some cheap gaming.  Christian is great and makes my bloody marys just the way I like them, spicy and delicious.  He is attentive and always looks out for me to make sure I get some kind of snack or something for my gaming.  My complaint is with the company itself, not the location.  They used to give us bonuses for playing with our players cards and you come in and get a nice $10.00 playing bonus or something.  Well, that is obviously GONE!  and it sucks too.  I've been bringing friends and they sign up for the card and in one sitting between the three of us we played about $1000.  I just knew two nights later I would have a great players bonus on my card.  But nope!  Nothing.  I was told that they suspended that for now.  Really?  C'mon company dudes!  Give us a bone.  There are too many places to gamble and at least have the illusion that we are gaining something even if not during that time of play, we can live for the points that we accumulate.  But now that you no logner honor that I gotta say you suck for that.  

So that's my only complaint but love the bloody mary's!"}
{"text":"This PT's location trumps all others! Best service, best cooks and friendliest staff compared to any other local bar i have been to. I am now a frequent customer there. No matter wht shift i get there at, Jen, Mike, Missy, Steven and Jackie always provide outstanding service, and are always friendly and attentive. Whether its fingers with extra crispy onion rings, the Gilroy pizza, or asking the cook to make me some random chicken dish, I have never been disappointed with my meal. Will definitely visit again... probably tonight for happy hour when I  get off work."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for my husband on his way out of Vegas because -
- It's only like 3-4 minutes from the car rental place so it's a good place to stop and have a drink and dinner before heading to the airport.
- The servers are super friendly and attentive.
- There are several tables with power outlets nearby. 
- Food is not anything that you're going to gush over but it's just fine and not too expensive and filling (the nachos are HUGE!!!).

I like this place because it's directly across from the airport and you can watch the planes taking off and landing. They're so close to the building (seriously just across the road and on the other side of a chain link fence) and close to other planes that it's kind of scary sometimes!"}
{"text":"Tracie is the perfect example of great service and personality that brings customers back!"}
{"text":"Always a winner 
Great happy hour
A lot of locations in Las Vegas 
Vist one your all
Just be there and enjoy"}
{"text":"Now I know I will NEVER return. I ordered a drink and started playing. I know that they are stupid strict about their play/comp drink but this was ridiculous!! While I was playing I ordered a second drink (which I had to hunt her down for, of course). At this point I know I have played over $20. I hit a little something, finished my drink and cashed out. I asked for my tab and guess what?? BOTH drinks were on my tab?? WTF?! I am not a rookie to casino bars. I typically always play when I go to bars and I know the protocol. I realize it was not happy hour but $8.75 for Captain on the rocks...and that was measured pour, not a double! I was so furious about my tab, I didn't even bother to argue with her. I know she knows better because we have encountered her at other PT's before. But I had tipped her off my win (because I DO know the rules) before she brought my tab which should have only had ONE drink, if any.

I hate that they don't value their guests here because I really wanted to love this place but as mentioned in my first sentence, I WILL NEVER RETURN!  

BTW, there was another visit in between these two reviews. That was ALSO crappy service but when the bartender \"manager\" could tell we were unhappy she offered to take off one of the rounds. Because she made it right, that is the only reason I returned for this visit. The aforementioned bartender was the same woman from visit two and final visit!!"}
{"text":"People at the bar was nice but I had one bad experience with this customer that had a little to much to drink, but other than that one bad situation the bar is a great place to meet new people and hangout and unwind."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great people, service and drinks. It's a great locals place to watch games or play pool"}
{"text":"Love this place. A locals favorite. The pool games are great. The bartenders are really good. Food is good for bar food. The locals that come here are fun and make the place!"}
{"text":"Me and my group arrived at around midnight for happy hour, she just brought our food at 12:50 and the place wasn't as busy as I've seen it on some Saturday nights.
I came in with 2 guy friends. When we were approached by the waitress, I asked about their draft selection and she quickly looked over her shoulder to both taps and replied, \"honey, we have a ton.. What do you like?\" I found this unprofessional and a little rude. I asked for a suggestion, not a guessing game. 
THEN when she took the food order, she started with the guys first and tried to pick up my menu without even asking if I wanted anything. Like legit skipped over me and was about to run off to the next thing. Not okay. 
Our order had a few VERY SIMPLE modifications (tots instead of fries, extra lemon pepper for wings) and our order was incorrect when it came out. Rather than collecting the plates and fixing the mistake immediately, the waitress walked back and forth to the kitchen 3 times to \"check\" the order. Ridiculous. 
Also, we ordered fried pickles as an \"appetizer\" and she failed to let us know that they were out until she brought out the food. Shouldn't she have known that beforehand?? Did it take 50 minutes to figure out??? 
Overall, the food and experience was mediocre. I frequent PTs because it's close to home, has good happy hour & I like the pizza. This isn't the first time that staff at this location has been disappointing. If it helps any, I had never seen the waitress at this location before, so she may just be getting the hang of things. Still, customer experience should come first."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I am newer to Las Vegas and I see these place everywhere and I was curious to try one out. They just built one super close to where my house is so I thought I would give it a try. 

Location is great and I saw it get built from the ground up. The interior is beautiful. For some reason it gave me a a coyote ugly vibe. They also played alternative rock music from the early 2000's that was fun. Where they lost me was the food. I ordered burger sliders which were not bad but they lost me at the crappy $20 frozen pizza. Not exaggerating but the crust tasted like cardboard.......yup, thats the best way to describe it. The sausage tasted like that cheap sausage you get from those frozen microwavable pizzas. I could have just gone to grimaldi's if i knew thats how awful the pizza would be considering the price. How is it that bowling alleys have tasty pizza but a place that has a full service kitchen can't produce a decent pizza. They probably have better things on the menu but their stuff was not super cheap to begin with so I most likely wont be coming back. I really wanted this to be a spot for my husband and I but if we are getting drinks we want some decent food to go with it."}
{"text":"It's fine. It's a PT's. I got a quesadilla, it was fine. But in typical PT's fashion, I played $20 and still got charged for my beer. I don't even fight it anymore. It just reinforces my decision to go other places until there's nowhere else to go after PT's takes all the bars over."}
{"text":"Went in for a buddies birthday on a Wednesday night (not busy at all 6:30-9). I ordered my food and it took a good 40+ minutes to come out, when it should have taken a max 15 minutes. When I asked for my check the server came in and out of the pool area (where we were seated) about 3 times before I got my check. This was about 15 minutes after I asked for the check."}
{"text":"Eh the guy Steven is just either not current with Wine  or is just a dumb ass retard . Or drunk on the job and can't retain basic information idk maybe just a retarded ."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in here to eat dinner while charging our electric car before heading back home to Los Angeles. 

Wow!  What a find!

First, great menu, great food, really friendly service.  And I mean, unbelievably good fish and chips. The batter tastes like it has malt vinegar already in it. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. 

Good music playing at the right volume. Windows, but shaded. TVs positioned just right. An abundance of ledges for drinks. Extremely nice women's bathroom with ledges on either side of the mirror, perfect for setting a drink. Who thought of that? It's brilliant!

\"Why do women need a ledge to put their drinks in the bathroom?\"

\"Where else are they going to put them?\"

I should mention I don't even drink. Their brewed iced tea is also perfect. 

We will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"Mikey pours the best 'Dirty Bong Waters' since the Redhawk. Always takes care of his customers. Steve's pretty good too, when he actually works ;)"}
{"text":"I give this place one star for the ambiance. This location just opened and is very clean. As far as the customer service, I would give zero stars. We were attempting to gamble and inquired about drink comps. The bartender was avoidant at first, and then proceeded to give us the run around regarding drink comps. It seemed as if he did not want to give us free drinks even though me and my friends all had money in the machines and were betting at least a dollar. He made us feel cheap for asking, even though that is what Vegas is about! Gambling and free drinks! Needless to say me and my friends cashed out and went to The Distill."}
{"text":"Prime Rib sandwich was tasteless, au jus was tasteless and the beer was crap.  Looks like they aerate it or something it has a head that quickly goes flat.

Service was slow and portion size has been dramatically reduced.  You used to get a lot, quantity over quality, now you a tiny sandwich or nachos that isnt even a meal!  

Why not break down and use garlic, onions and a decent sized bun and fill it with food?

Don't come here unless you want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not 5  due to the price.  Like in another review (Beau's), my Guinness was not half off during happy hour. Other than that I've had zero negative interactions here. I have also always sat at the bar so the bartender is always asking if I need anything. 
I've had take out twice and breakfast once.  My breakfast burrito was massive and delicious.  
Back to the price issue...tonight I got a Guinness, basket of fries, mozzarella sticks, 10 bone in wings with chips and 2 Pepsis with tip I spent ~$52.  The wings were awesome. Not your more bone than meat situations you'll get at other restaurants.  I'll definitely go back and get the 1/2 price drinks and pizza during happy hour."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever from bartender \"J-ME\"! Not welcoming at all! Has a bad attitude and seriously she shouldn't even be a bartender at PTS! She also charged me for a pineapple back and said \"it doesn't matter you're paying for it anyways!\" I mean I don't care if the pineapple back is $500! Point is she does not need to act a certain way towards people at local bars especially the locals- JME if you hate your job, please quit... makes it easier for everyone and also no one needs your attitude at a bar when we are all going out to have a good time! Management- please contact me."}
{"text":"I was fairly surprised at how pleased I was at this location. Although the restaurant itself was very dark, smokey, and a bit out dated, the service & food were waaaayy better than at other locations I've been to.

The wings were much tastier & meatier, and I was even allowed to get 2 different sauces (other location said I couldn't).

My coworkers & I came during lunch and we received our food in a decent amount of time, and our server made sure we were in & out.

I'd come back here even if there's another location closer to our office"}
{"text":"Their wings are just OK. $11 for 10 wings & fries wasn't worth it for me... At least their wings anyways. The wings were small & dry. I actually liked the fries better. I was also bummed that you can only choose 1 sauce for the wings. If you buy the bucket of wings, then you can get 3 sauces.

The service wasn't the greatest either. I came during lunch & they weren't that busy. It took our server several minutes to get our drink order, then it took almost 30 minutes to get our food.

I also ate here another time & ordered the Philly Cheese Steak w/ fries, and that too was dry."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pts I've been to in Vegas. Also clean. Totally forgot the bartenders name but she was awesome. She suggested some new drinks and they've probably become some of my faves. Gotta try their buffalo hot wings which are to die for."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour for the first time today. They didn't have an obvious happy hour menu which is fine. But it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we were sitting there (we were right next to the bar). It wasn't busy at all. Once we were finally given menus service was just slow. The food was decent. We ordered a pizza and nachos. Due to the slow and not very personable service I don't anticipate returning."}
{"text":"Deserves no stars. Horrible service! Took over an hour to get food and had to get it to go! Then they didn't offer to take any off the bill. 
Understaffed! Please avoid at all costs! Epic failure!  
Get a clue!"}
{"text":"Love that fact I recently found out about this place randomly.. so glad I did.... cause I have to pass this place going home from work... service is fast"}
{"text":"Super friendly crew in a beautiful new building.  They have windows which is a rarity in Las Vegas bars.  Fantastic menu to cover all tastes, a \"Cheers\" vibe, wonderful drinks and happy hour, and outstanding customer service.  I purposely followed Heather to this location, but all the staff is great.  I look forward to many more visits here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazed at what they did with the space as this was formerly a dark, cramped BJ's.  This location is in an industrial park off Valley View, but that makes for a nice, low key location with personalized service.

PT's is the king of local casino taverns and the \"Gold\" taverns have an upgraded menu from the regular PT's.  All locations have a regular and reverse happy hour, plus half off breakfasts in the morning daily.

It's the usual PT's stuff, but the space is fantastic.  I had bacon and eggs. My husband had the grilled chicken. The food was the good quality we expect from PT's and service from bartender London and server Emily on day shift was exemplary.  I look forward to visiting them again soon."}
{"text":"PT's/Golden Gaming makes sure that their properties provide consistent service and items across their properties and this one is no exception. So, it's basically a standard experience no matter which location you vist.  For me, I go where Heather B. goes, so since she is working swing shift at this location, it's my \"go-to\" PT's.  Heather is absolutely one of the best assets PT's/Golden has, and I will always follow her to wherever she is stationed.  She also has some magic way of cultivating a good crowd at the bar without fail.

I would like to note that this location is set up a little different.  It's quite spacious.  There's a great area for the pool table and a nice comfortable seating area with plush chairs that aren't immediately noticeable from the entry or bar since they are partitioned off.  It's a great place to have a casual drink.

We went to this location to visit Heather for the Golden Knights' appearance in the first round of the NHL playoffs.  The bar was packed, but Heather and her staff did an outstanding job keeping everyone happy, even managing to hand out a free Miller draft to everyone before the puck drop.   That's impressive in a crowded bar and super impressive since Heather was the only actual bartender working.  I was also pleased with the specials that PT's offers during games (free beer for puck drop, match play for gamers, drink and food specials).  I'd also like to mention that it was really cool that during the National Anthem, the place went silent.  Everyone in the place either removed their hats, stood (if possible), or put their hands on their hearts.  I' ve rarely seen that and appreciate that the staff was respectful during that moment.    The whole experience was fantastic and I will always remember that night and watching our team clinch a victory.

Thanks again, Heather B. and staff for making the first playoff game a special memory."}
{"text":"This a great new neighborhood bar! The happy hour and 1/2 off breakfast specials are definitely worth a trip over there! The staff is friendly, prompt and courteous. A great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We noticed the new property a few weeks ago so we waited for them to get the kinks out. First, let me say that Damara, our waitress, was 5 stars. She was sweet,  attentive and did her job. Fast forward....we ordered a breakfast burrito and a salad.  40 minutes later,  we're still waiting.  We were getting ready to just pay for our drinks and leave. My salad was good but not long afterwards my gf found egg shell in her buritto which was the quick end of that. Needless to say, we don't plan on returning EVER . They blew their chance to make a positive first impression. 
There are WAY too many restaurants in this town to have to tolerate this kind of experience."}
{"text":"Have you had the hangover burger at this place?? It's the best burger for about $14!  Wow. I can't wait to go back and get that again. By the way our bartender and server London was amazing and very friendly and took good care of us!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We had a problem with EVERYTHING here.  Literally everything.

We had a school function at 5:30, so 3 of us went here for dinner beforehand.  Got there at 4:30 and were the ONLY people in the restaurant section (other patrons were just 2 people playing pool and 2 ladies at the bar drinking).  We looked at the menu and ordered at 4:40.  The waitress repeated the order to us and had everything correct.  That's when the problems started.  Here are my list of complaints:

1.) We ordered at 4:40, but did not get our food until 5:15.  Remember, we were the only people in the restaurant and we had to be back at school by 5:30.

2.) Because we had about 10 minutes to eat before we had to race back to school, we asked for the check right away.  The waitress disappeared with our cards until 5:25.

3.) While stuffing our food down our throats because it took 35 minutes to make 2 wraps and some sliders, we noticed many things wrong.  The french fries were burnt and hard.  My friend ordered a club wrap, but they sent out a bikini wrap.  We didn't have time to order another one and, oh yeah, our waitress hadn't returned still.

4.) She brings back the bill and my friend lets her know that the wrong food item was made for her.  The waitress says, \"Oh. Sorry.  I must have entered it wrong.\"  and WALKED AWAY.  No offer to take it off the bill.

5.) They charged me $0.75 for my side of ranch to dip my burnt fries in.  Really?

6.) Waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks.

Needless to say, the food was poorly prepared, service was nonexistant, our order was wrong, and they charge for ranch dressing.  We were also 10 minutes late getting back to our school.  I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Decided to switch it up and I must say this location is perfect for hipsters. Dropped $300 playing $1 and .25 video poker and not one bartender was personable. Pizza was great, but horrible music and vibe!!!!"}
{"text":"$28 for a 16 inch pizza with double pepperoni.  Tasted ok,  but not worth $28.  Bartender was rude but had nice tattoos.  Next time I'll just get a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible food! I've been to PT's locations all over town and the food is consistently good.....up until now. We ordered a party bucket of boneless wings and they were very overcooked. Most were actually burned. For the entire party bucket (2.5 lbs of boneless wings!!) they only give you 3 little cups of blue cheese or ranch. Be prepared to pay extra if you need more. Go to a different location if you plan to eat anything!"}
{"text":"Great staff, and home for the Buckeyes on football Saturday's. We dubbed it the Vegas Shoe. Good food specials and drink prices are not bad, not cheap but not too pricey. A mug of Miller Lite or Bud Light is like $5+ can't remember, I always get it on special for football days when it is $4.75 on special from time to time. Food is good, and they have specials usually during happy hours or during sporting events or what not. Staff has been great every time I have been there, attractive, attentive and good sense of humor. What more could you ask for. Definitely one of, if not my favorite of all the PT's"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to play pool.  However only one table.  Great pizza but only one size available, large.  Happy hour drinks are great and reasonable.  Shannon the barmaid, rocks and we enjoy having her serve us."}
{"text":"This bar has changed so much in the past few months. I am currently here with an empty beer and a bartender has not acknowledged me for at least 30 minutes. Before they would not let my glass get empty. They need to focus on their customers."}
{"text":"Went to PT's to watch a game because our usual pub was standing room only. The place was pretty empty mid day but they have plenty of TVs and made sure that our game was on. The service was pretty good. We got our drinks and food promptly at the bar."}
{"text":"Do NOT go if you are a local. I went there for the first time with my wife. Sat at one of the poker seats at the bar. I live in the area. We ordered drinks, food and started to gamble and was winning. We started to talk to others near. The 8 people around us were all locals too and visiting for the first time. After about 30 minutes, the bartender came up to us and asked us to move because they had some BIG HITTERS coming in. He would give us $50 more to gamble with and pick up our tab. It seemed really weird. Is this normal in Vegas? Then, one by one, he started to ask those around us too to move. We had all started to talk to each other because you could see on each person's face how disappointed they were upset too. The bartender then said that he would get in trouble with his supervisor if we didn't move but that we didn't have to. However, the last time he couldn't get someone to move he got in trouble but that we didn't have to. All of us eventually said it was wrong and rude. So we left and all agreed we wouldn't come back and would tell at least 10 of our friends the story. I wonder if the BIG HITTERS will spend what the Eight of us would spend over the years plus the 10 each who will never visit as well. Boo!"}
{"text":"good PT's like it much more than other PT's on Silverado Ranch Blvd."}
{"text":"Like the other PT's on Silverado better. I mean let's face it all PT's are pretty much the same accept for the service you receive. I have been to this one a couple of times and for the most part the service has been average. All the times I was there is was not busy and yet servers and bartenders seems more interested in just hanging out with each other and regulars than making sure everyone was good."}
{"text":"What can you say...PTs, kind of like the 7-11 of bars in town. One on every corner. Friendly bartender, decent drink prices. Only one pool table at this location though. We did come on a Friday evening, wasn't too busy. Decent place to grab a few drinks and relax."}
{"text":"Yes, PT's are a dime a dozen here in Vegas, and this one wasn't much different (in layout) than others, however, when you have a friendly waitress, good bar service and no chimney next to you blowing ciggy smoke in your face, then it turns into an above average experience...and that's what this was. Good beer and well drink prices to boot. 
As for amenities, there are a few pool tables, decent number of flat screens and lots of seating, so have fun!"}
{"text":"Very good place, not Smokey lots of TV's around the bar. A great place to watch the golden knights game. The bartenders are very friendly. I've been to other PT's around the valley and this one being so new is really nice. The food at this particular PT's is really really good. Get the pizza and Mac and cheese bits!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for happy hour a couple of times. The buffalo chicken pizza is pretty good and the drinks are alright. The bartenders are friendly and the place is clean. I ordered a sangria one night but wasn't too fond of it. Overall it's a decent place just to hang out and play pool."}
{"text":"Love this bar.
Mandi and Jewels are amazing.
VGK on all tvs wirh volume.
Come Visit!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite PT's to go to at the moment.  The bartenders are nice, the place is spacious, and there's a nice area outside to just chill at.  There are also pool tables and the infamous Golden Tee to play.  It's clean, and the food is good.  It's set up pretty nice.  I'm just a fan of this place."}
{"text":"I love this particular PTs compared to all the other ones around vegas. The staff here is always so easy to talk to and provide great service. They also have the best happy hour for a bar with all their drinks being half off! I always get their gilroy pizza which is always very tasty."}
{"text":"Yeah I hadn't gone into a PT's until they built one I bought a house in Summerlin 20 years ago and I'm retired now but I used to get takeout from PT's Pub cuz that was one of the first locations on Hualapai between Spring Mountain and between Twain and Flamingo on the left hand side as you're headed towards the 215 and they have great food great selection great atmosphere 15 slot machines a dining area that's closed off for no smoking you can smoke at the bar you can eat at the bar in your gaming machines are fairly good you can win some money I've won a lot of money they're not a lot but enough that is paid for my food a few times and they got a Bonus system and you can get free cocktails when you're playing and have a good time they're real friendly they're clean well maintained the building is presentable from the office if you go there enjoy yourself and let tell him that Michael Thibodeaux sent you and that you want to order a french fries no I'm just kidding enjoy it I always do"}
{"text":"I usually go in the morning for half off breakfast and the service is really good. After noon food is a little pricey but if you have Pt's card then you get discounts on certain things. Certain days Happy hour to you can also check out. Breakfast is good and they have a good burger."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half during Football Sunday for our food. All the food came out separately.   Driest chicken sandwich EVER. Stale taco salad. The fried pickles were extremely salty. Everything was cold. While the waitress excuse was everyone ordered at once; I don't know a restaurant that should have a problem with fries, pickles and chicken sandwich. They even ran out of cups at noon so they gave us drinks in a styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"This PT's was awesome. We went during happy hour and the drink prices were very reasonable. The waitress was friendly and the pizza was very, very good. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Ashley and Amy are the sweetest. If you need to go to AA  here's the place to go. Lol. Attentive with great personality!"}
{"text":"Nice location especially being able to look at the airport. It's clean and the service was fairly friendly but the food took a while to come out for half a busy bar."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless u replace the bartenders and servers. The worse service ever. They don't pay attention to you nor look for your needs. I literally walked in and found a place to sit expecting someone to come and take an order for us. We had to walk up to the bar and waited a long time for someone to help us even after we kept calling for service. They can't multitask. Eventually when we moved to a different spot at the bar we finally got a bartenders attention Cuz the servers didn't do anything to help when we tried. Even then he walked off with our card and never came back with our drinks until we demanded him to focus on us. Took forever. He didn't come back with our card because he assumed we want an open tab... When he told us about happy hour on food and drinks, he recommended their pizza, so we ordered it. Took them a while to tell us they can't make it because they're out of stock.. Lame! Just got our beer and took off. I like the Spring Mountain location better"}
{"text":"Nice clean bar, 50 percent off all drinks at happy hour is nice . Football drink n food specials . Friendly wait staff and bartenders , nice draft beer choices and TV screens . No real complaints about this place . If you need food ideas try the gyro fries with a tall Black and Tan . I recommend ."}
{"text":"I love this place! I take my employees here at least once a month and the staff are friendly. The environment is easy going and the food is great! Their wings are the best. I recommend trying this place out if you've never been here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was OK, but they played slow 90's emo music. When I asked the bartender to change it, he acted offended and put it to a different station like the first one. We waited for over 10 minutes before we were even asked if we wanted a drink. Then, upon spending $2500 gambling, we simply asked for some wings to go. We waited for 10 minutes before she even entered it into the computer. 
We waited over 15 minutes just for the bartenders to walk around to ask if we wanted another drink or food. Worst service ever! We will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"Clap Clap Clap what amazing service from bartender Miss Ashley and Cook Manager Frank. They're superb and deserve their own franchise, they go above and beyond."}
{"text":"PT's lemon pepper is actually almost unbearably salty that you need to wipe it with a napkin or dunk it in a cup of ranch. 

This PT's is fairly new, so the bar itself is nice and not yet smoky smelling. There is a lot of seating and plenty of screens."}
{"text":"Thursday night, only one bartender.  I had to wait for 10 min to order  my drink. That's ridiculous. Schedule more bartenders for busy nights like that!!! But in general the atmosphere was nine, music pretty chill."}
{"text":"Monica is anti social pay $40 and comp 1 drink because she's so busy converting with her friends. No thanks you or your welcome. I'll stick with the lodge."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new location so I understand that means new bartenders but man this one guy is bad. I'm not one to judge a bartender based off one experience nor am I hard on them because I am in the industry and I understand some people have a bad night. But this guy, Damien, has served my boyfriend and I several times and each time is it just as bad if not worse. He is slow and not attentive at all. We order food and will have it and empty drinks for 30 min before he even comes to see if we needed anything with our food. One night my boyfriend could not eat because he needed a fork and his food was cold by the time he came around to ask us and get him one.  He has no expression and seems not to be angry but not happy just like blah he just is slow. I watch him work and he doesn't serve anyone.... so like what is he doing? Idk but we will not be back here which is unfortunate because it is close to our house. Maybe they will get a different graveyard bartender?

The girl servers are good but they have to wait for the drinks from him which make it slow too...."}
{"text":"Food was okay but Leslie the server is horrible! I was standing behind her for 10 mins while she talks to another customer. No one else was at the bar to help. I had to call the bar to get someone and another bartender came and she said that Leslie will help me get my food. Really?? I've been standing there for awhile and did not even acknowledge me??? Bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service ever. This woman was on her phone the entire time and never cared to ask for  food orders or anything. Another customer was here and she spent the entire time speaking to her. I wanted to cash out and I had to walk up to her to ask for the check. Will Never come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is getting one star because I liked my food, but the customer service, or lack there of is the reason it's not getting any more. 

We were \"greeted\" at the bar by a scowled face female bartender, and placed our drink order and then placed a food order. She went around the bar (that was all men) and flirted with them but never checked on us. 30 minutes later our food comes out and again we get the scowl face. She couldn't get back to the guys fast enough so they could stare at her fake boobs. Little piece of advice, if you would have treated us better, we would have tipped you better than the trash you were busy flirting with. Doesn't take much to smile and make a customer feel welcome. We ended up leaving after 2 beers because of her, there are way too many local bars around to be treated like you're an annoyance."}
{"text":"The venue is decent but the food at PT's is not that great. I wish they served better quality food and didn't get rid of all the beer selections for their house craft stuff. Their house crafted beer doesn't taste bad, but I like drinking Blue Moon!

There are lots of screens to stay on top of the games and a few video poker and keno and blackjack machines, but only specific ones have the blackjack machines, which is my favorite."}
{"text":"I prefer the pizza rather than the wings here. The lemon pepper is extremely salty and really needs a lot of ranch to offset the flavor.

The pizzas are good though. Can't go wrong with pepperoni and mushroom pizza. 

Bartender was alright. I've received better service at other PT's, but I think they rotate from every location anyways."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server, Nakita was wonderful. We decided to sit at the bar and gamble a little, but left shortly after. The bartenders were very unwelcoming. Nobody wants to go to a bar where the bartenders are unpleasant. We won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service and steve the bartenders alway cool.. Pool tables and dart boards well kept."}
{"text":"The most unattentive bartenders/waitresses at this PTs. If the guy bartender isn't here, don't bother. My friend finished his beer at least 10 minutes before I did and didn't get an offer for a refill until around the time I finished. I wish I could say that this was just an off night, but this is the usual case. I don't like to post negative reviews, but it just gets too unacceptable at some point. If you're lucky enough to be comped a drink, start buying lottery tickets."}
{"text":"Jennifer and Tina are personable and fun. They have lots of specials and the bar food hits the spot after a long day. They keep the bar clean and is a great local spot."}
{"text":"This PT's is now officially the closest bar to our home which is awesome! 

The happy hour is great for drinks, I got a 16oz beer for $2.00. However, the happy hour food is limited it to half priced pizza. 

I ordered the bikini wrap with sweet potato fries and I was delightfully surprised. The wrap was huge with a heaping amount of tender chicken. My boyfriend ordered chicken tenders that left a lot to be desired. 

I love the space with the Edison bulb lighting and the amount of televisions, but I think the wall art of half naked woman is overkill and tacky.

Overall, I'm happy with the location. My rating is a 3 Star because I think PT's is mediocre at best in general regardless of the specific location."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst bar experience I have ever unfortunately had to experience. My friends and I came in for some drinks and apps and it took them 20 minutes before even coming to our table despite the many times they glanced at our table and just walked away as if we were not there. It was not until I DESPERATELY flagged down someone changing the trash that he came over and said \"oh I'll call someone over\" and the server who was ignoring us the whole time finally came over and asked us \"ok what do you want\" with an attitude.
At this point, having been a server myself, I tried to be understanding of her situation but upon asking her for a menu she snapped back saying \"Well we don't have a menu, I'll just tell you.\" This really threw me off because after waiting and being ignored for 20 minutes, this was the last thing I was expecting. 

She took our order and it took them another 20 minutes to bring out our drinks and upon bringing out our drinks she said she forgot mine. I asked her to switch from a \"Long Island iced tea\" to a \"Midori Sour\" since they haven't even made my drink. She tells me okay and after waiting for ANOTHER 20 MINUTES finally brings back our drink--the WRONG DRINK. And after letting her know it was the wrong drink, she started whining that she forgot and said \"Well can you just drink that\". 

I am honestly appalled at this experience and at this extremely terrible experience. After waiting for OVER an hour for my drinks, I would've at least expected an apology. I cannot believe I am expected to pay for something that I DID NOT EVEN ORDER. Will never be returning here."}
{"text":"tino and ashley are great. lucky to have such a cool place close to home. try the gilroy pizza. unreal!!if you play video poker they take care of you"}
{"text":"I don't really post reviews unless its REALLY good or a REALLY bad location.

I'll start by saying that I have gone to this location a few times since they opened. I literally pass it twice a day every day. The location is nicely decorated; the food is good even though it's a bit overpriced, and people who work there are very friendly. 

HOWEVER, I have encountered a few issues. One time, I phone ordered food, picked it up and paid cash. I noticed I was short changed $5 or $10. I can't remember since it was in the beginning of the year. I didn't really care that much and simply didn't do anything about it at that point since I figured it was human error and I was in a rush.

To avoid this, I decided to start paying with my card. Well.....I just looked at my transactions when I logged into my account on my credit card and noticed that I was charged twice the last time I visited. The first charge, was processed for the amount totaled WITHOUT a tip and the second transaction was processed on my card WITH the tip. How annoying....Not sure if this occurs just at this location, or at all locations, but, I disputed the transaction without the tip since the second transaction with the tip went through. I have decided to stop going to PT's altogether. 

Also, their rewards point thing sucks since you must have your card with you so that you get your points. If you lose your card you have to open a new one, or at least that's how it was when I was a member a while back. It would be nice if you could just give them a phone number or email address so they can credit your rewards points, or you can track your visits/purchases through a phone app like most other places do. 

Hence, I haven't bothered with their rewards system for a while now since I have lost about 3 of their rewards cards. I have had to start a new rewards card and lost prior rewards points every time I lost one of their rewards card.

So, if you go to PT's, ensure you check your bill, get your correct change, and check online charges for duplicate charges. 

PT's is a big franchise in Las Vegas. There's at least one within a two mile radius to have to deal with these kinds of issues."}
{"text":"New management took over recently and I can see the differences.  Service is terrible and now so are the prices. $9 for a Moscow mule, I didn't know I was downtown. Since when are local bars like pts supposed to charge $9 for drinks then not even put it on HH. I didn't know ginger beer was the difference between 50% off and nothing at all. Bartender Daniel is an ass. If you aren't cool with him already or you aren't a female, good luck getting service. Dude looked right at me or past me multiple times while asking others if they wanted drinks. Pts used to be a place to go chill And have fun. Now I'm paying for $10 drinks and getting bad service while I'm at it. If this is the case, then I'll go elsewhere. That doesn't really matter much to them I'm sure anyways. Overall not a good location, but like I said, for $10 drinks, the whole city of Vegas has better bars to go to for those prices!!!"}
{"text":"I love this PT's location. I have been to other locations and they aren't nearly as nice or have as good of an atmosphere. You can't beat the 50% off all bar drinks happy hour. Good draft selection and full bar.
All the food there is good, particularly the pretzel bites, steak salad, turkey sandwich, burgers, and curly fries. Not the biggest fan of their pizza because it has a cracker thin crust, but when you are drunk put a little ranch on it and for half price it is worth sobering you up. 
Very nice atmosphere. Bright with nice comfortable chairs. Lots of TVs. Mostly good service, like all places it depends on the day and whose working but we have had more amazing service than poor service. 
This is our go to comfy sit and watch the game and have a few mugs of beer and food we look forward to bar."}
{"text":"PT's has a great happy hour and it is geared towards to people who work throughout the day. You can get all drinks half off and half off pizza at two different times of day.  The service is always fun and friendly. It is a local spot, but I haven't many too many people in these bars, still Vegas seems to be clicky compared to other places I have lived. However, they have some great beers for 3 bucks for a big 32 Oz.  The food is good, along with some have shuffle board, pool, jukebox, and darts."}
{"text":"Just walked in to have a drink. The waitress walked over and said \"id's\" no hello... my name is or any greeting of the sort. Extremely rude and made us uncomfortable.  She stated she was from California... which I assume was her excuse for being so rude. My friends and I decided not to order drinks or a meal. Afraid of the outcome due to the service being beyond horrible. We will not be back...there are too many other options. We're now at No Regrets and they are super nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Was there for NYE 12/31/14 ordered wings burgers and fries. Food was fantastic hot and fresh. We were a party of 4."}
{"text":"Surdy was our bar tender.    Not attentive at all. Never came by and asked if we wanted another drink. In fact when I asked him for another drink he ignored me and didn't even make eye contact.  
Inexperienced bartender.  He needs training on how to interact with customers.    Never come back here again"}

You're competing with Distill! Get a grip! You need the business, it's not the other way around. Here on a Saturday and place is empty. No wonder why. Golden Gaming, do yourself a favor and put Monica behind a desk away from public. This place will go down unless things change quickly."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on Tuesday with my work so it wasn't busy.  PT's is the first bar/restaurant I've been to off of the Las Vegas strip, so it was nice to see another side of Vegas.  Initially, PT's reminded me of BJ's except that PT's has a separate dining room/section from the bar and slot machines. 

They serve American foods: salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, wings, pizza, fried chicken.  I noticed that they also serve BUCKETS of sliders, haha.  Must get that next time... 

I ordered the bbq chicken salad.  I liked that they used mixed greens and mixed the bbq/ranch dressing into the salad for you rather then having it on the side.  The grilled chicken was pretty dry so I probably won't order this again.  My boss ordered the bbq chicken salad as well but he had them serve it in a wrap, which I would suggest because it comes with a side of fries. Someone else ordered a burger, which looked pretty tasty.

I've heard some good things about their happy hour, so I'll probably come back during those hours the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i visited the pt's gold on hualapai and russel or maybe sunset sunday the 28th. hardly anybody there, my wife ordered the california wrap, i ordered the 6 dollar tacos, not bad. started playing poker right away and was served a beer. by my third beer we were ready to get out. asked the bartender for my bill, and she proceded to tell me that i had not met the minimum play requirements on poker and brought me my bill for 50.00 dollars and cents. has pt's changed their player requirements?. after reluctantly paying the 50 bucks i called their corporate office and was told of no such policy of minimum play.
they reassured me the regional manager would call me..........still waiting!!!
they have lost my business!!! i wonder if the woman bartender is skimmimg off the top and corporate does not know about it yet???????
how about an investigation and a responce for christ sake."}
{"text":"Hello...  Star service here at this location. The bartenders are premier quality and on point. I dont know why or where this woman called Amy gets her comments. I was there sitting 4 stools down from her and I  witnessed everything.  She is totaly in the untruth in her comments. For me tho its been a pleasure and great service everytime I frequent this establishment. Been coming here since  opening day. So once again  all the way. Kudos!! 

Julie and Tilly are the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and pizza.  One of my favorites for happy hour for football.."}
{"text":"My cousins are regulars here. I loved how they knew the bartenders (Manny and Sean) and I felt more comfortable that my family trusted them. The drinks were good, the food was yummy, and I won during my poker game. All pluses for me.

Anyway, I've only been here twice, both times for short periods. I really wished I could have stayed longer because I love the atmosphere and the workers are always so nice."}
{"text":"PT's are mostly all the same in Vegas. The difference between most of them is how friendly and personable the bartenders are. 

The bartender that I experienced seemed like it wasn't their day, and it was a little hard to get their attention to get the check. They were texting on their phone and tending to other guests.

Food was okay. Drinks were alright. Not happy that they replaced Blue Moon with their house ale stuff, but it was still alright. 

Pricing can be a little expensive for the quality of food that you get, but like I said, most PT's are pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Place is close to my house and twice I've gone in for their \"happy hour\" food they advertise and both times it seemed like I was bother the bartenders they always yell from across the room theirs no server I have to order at the bar, such a nice place and you try to support the area but I don't need to be yelled at rudely like I'm bothering them. Glad I would walk to the bar with no issue but put a sign or something I can't read minds. Also why advertise Food happy hour if you're not prepared to handle the business."}
{"text":"I find it funny how people complain about the food. Come on now. Get a grip people. It's a bar. It's good food for bar food. I only come here to drink and play Golden Tee. The food is just fine. 
Service? I have never had an issues with service. Dan is the man. Very friendly. Curtis is the best bartender I have ever experienced at a PTs. He knows what you want before you even have to ask for it. Need I say more. I wish he worked more swings so I could get in more."}
{"text":"This PTs location is huge! There are tons of pool tables available, seating, and the location is very central Las Vegas.. located on spring mountain and arville right in China town. Happy hour is 5-7, half off drinks and food! The vibe is very chill. The crowd at this location consisted of an older crowd as well. Unfortunately service was baddd. Our poor server had to take care of basically the whole place during the game, and we had to wait so much to receive our drinks, food, even sides. Had to flag her down for everything. My recommendation.. have more ppl available during busy nights?"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Had to ask for a refill on my beer everytime. And the tvs dont have sound unless its a golden knight game"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of chains but this location does alright by me. They have 2.50 24oz frozen mugs for happy hour and they are right across from where I get my car worked on."}
{"text":"I have come to this P.T.'s numerous times for both lunch and happy hour. 

I love love love the pretzel bites here. They are warm and salty and served with cheese and mustard. The chicken wings are decent, you can get them with sweet potato fries for an extra charge. They also have very large, yummy salads. 

Service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"My favorite PT's in Vegas. I come here about once a month to meet a friend for lunch. I always order the same meal (Mardi Gras Chicken). I only go here for lunch so I cannot rate the drinks or service at night. Staff generally good, had one time when our food took forever. 

Chill atmosphere and will be back"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened since my last visit.  My recent visit was on a Friday (2/9) at 8 PM  and it was nowhere near what I've experienced previously. 

Service Summary:  The center bar was pretty busy so we sat at one of the tables right outside the bar area which was not busy at all. 

20 minutes before our server stopped by to drop off a menu.
15 minutes to return to take our order
After we ordered: 
20 minutes to bring back two draft beers
45 minutes to receive our order of: A chicken Siracha Sandwich and an order of wings. 
There was no sense of urgency and the service overall was disappointing.  

Soon after, we were assigned another server and she was great.  She got our 2nd round of drinks to us immediately and checked on us the rest of the night.

This was like an episode of Bar Rescue.  Unacceptable service at the beginning and a complete 180 in the end.  The renovated bar is fantastic but the service seems to be hit or completely miss based on your server.  We'll see if another visit is in the future, but that's another Yelp tale. =)"}
{"text":"our bartender Molly, didnt know the price of certain shots. being a bar tender we shldnt have to wait for a price of certain shots. new location but more than 1 unhappy customer in here other than me.. never coming back.. sucks! 
what sucked is that it seemed only the single men got the attention thinking we werent going to tip well.. ordered wings which were good.. then thought we give the fish tacos a try.. my husbands came with 1 lemon, mine didnt fish tacos tasted as if they were frozen and heated in a microwave.. it sad cause we were really hoping this place would be a new hang out and nope... never again. seems like these broads only got hired for looks and thats it.."}
{"text":"We walked in and had to wait for the bartender to notice we were there, after ordering our drinks we waited for the rest of our party to show. Once everyone was at the bar we were still waiting on the bartender to take his focus off of one customer and by that time we decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings because the service was already proving to be less then acceptable. The bartender needs to also give attention to other customers not just his friends."}
{"text":"PT's has delicious food... big portions, fresh off the grill, and great deals... their drinks are pretty great as well.
Happy hours is really good here they have a prices here for Happy hour.
If youre looking for a party I say this is more of a laid back bar, no rowdy guest, no loud drinkers, not even during games. Its a quite place to eat and drink. 
One thing I have to put them on the map for is there freakin amazingly delicious and creative ways to serve their fried. OMG they make fries a whole new category on its own at PTs... if you just need a quick snack try some fries. Dont get me wrong Ive tried other food, and its just as good, but those fries are addictive! 
The service isn't anything to shout to the world about, they kinda favor towards certain ppl or regulars or im not sure, but the tend to some a bit more then others... but they are quite attentive to the rest just some more then others... they dont smile much in here either....But I never get bad service in here! Just laid back more quiet service, not a bad thing! 

Id say if you haven't been go! Especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. 4 Jack and Cokes and a large pizza only $23. Best deal and very nice atmosphere. Large TVs to watch sports as well as a pool table and lounge. Smells a bit smokey but nothing compared to some of the other 24 hour local bars in vegas. Great outdoor seating as well"}
{"text":"I have been to several PT's in the area and this location is definitely one of my favorites. I usually get boneless wings but this time I tried the summer special carne asada sandwich. All I can say is YUM! Amazing flavor on the meat with pepper jack, avocado,  and pico on grilled sourdough.  My twister fries were maybe a bit too crunchy for my taste but still good. Great atmosphere in this place and the bartender was friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Is all I can say. The Frickin annoying drunk guy talking so LOUD like he was the only one in the bar made it so weird never come back. Cussing loudly with the bartender so so bad. I wanted to stand up an tell the guy to ARGUE."}
{"text":"Just might become our new local bar hangout. Friendly staff and the bar food isn't your typical fare. As for people complaining out food arriving \"in a bucket\" YOU ordered a bucket!
The menu has a picture of a bucket. 

As for the chicken in the bucket it came hot and fresh.

Only been to this location a couple times but both visits Christian made suggestions to our orders that were right on.

Also show your Wet 'n' Wild pass and get 20% off"}
{"text":"Heather the bartender and Christie were great! Awesome experience and the drinks were right on par! Will start coming back more! Love the new staff and can't pass up seeing Bo every weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to get a new bar close to home. But the service is terrible! The waitress passed us by multiple times and never took our order so I can't speak to the food quality because we left after 20 mins passed. Overall- of service changes (aka get better trained employees), we will come back."}
{"text":"Devon is the best bartender here at Pts, very sweet, amazing customer service, attentive to our needs, has the best personality!!!! Hands down the best bartender in town!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, I was just driving by. I grabbed me a beer.. the bartender was very nice and the crowd was calm. Music was also pretty good, I like this location :)"}
{"text":"This place has many memories, I like to come back and remember the good ones. Great bartender! Only thing is  fireball shots are a tad on the small side with a price tag"}
{"text":"Brought some clients here for lunch today. We arrived around 11:30 am so we had no wait what so ever. 

I ordered the Beef Dip sandwich with coleslaw @ $11.99. The roll was toasted and the beef was very lean, tender and went great with the Au jus. The cole slaw was also tasty and no overly sweet.. 

One of my clients ordered the chicken nachos and It was gigantic at $11.99. Our waitress was friendly and food came out quickly, she also kept our ice teas constantly filled. 

I would recommend this for lunch and is probably great to hang for happy hour."}
{"text":"So this place used to be great, not so much anymore. They have taken away bartenders and made it terrible. Shitty service, you wait forever for a beer, especially from Sean. Sean couldn't handle more than two tables and a few people at the bar himself and honestly it's not his fault, the manager should have more people on shift. Whomever is managing this place now has made this place go from great to terrible SO FAST! Shame on him. Pick a different PT's gold, let this one fail."}
{"text":"Bomb nachos, wings, and tater tots. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"We went in this morning at 6:30am.  We were the only patrons.  Our server took our order and 20 minutes later, no breakfast nor a refill on coffee.   Finally the cook brings our food to the table.  The ham, cheese & mushroom omlette need help.  Ham was not recognizable.  It was shredded  and tasted terrible. Pancakes were good.  Never offered more coffee, nor were we checked on during our breakfast.  This was the first time I had been in and probably the last."}
{"text":"As much as I love this bar, the bartender lady with the glasses ruined this experience.   My boyfriend gambled about $200 into the machines here and still charged him for every beer we had.  We had asked her politely if we owed her anything and she through it in our face that since he wasn't Max betting on quarters that he still owed her a $100 tab. This isn't the first time that she's been so unwelcoming.  She did it to us the last time we came in.   It pretty much ruined our Saturday night out."}
{"text":"What's the point of renovating the place if the service is twice as bad? Our waitress had to be waived down after 15 mins of sitting down. She always brought the wrong beer out or food option. SHE NEEDED A NOTE PAD!!!!!!! so disappointed. Will not come back here!"}
{"text":"The place was empty and service was slow. We ordered sandwiches. What's the hold-up? Fries don't take over 35 minutes."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Poor customer service. It's a waste of time and money to gamble here. Go to Wildfire or Station. PT's is overpriced, the machines are tight and the staff is rude, slow and they are lazy."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this plate on a late late night. Cheap drinks and pizza at this hour. Not bad. I was kinda bummed that I saw no dart board in sight.

All I got was a Long Island Iced Tea to accompany my terrible pool skills. Among friends, it's all just a good time. 

Place wasn't too busy at around the 1am hour on a Saturday. Great place to hang after hours if you're looking for a mellow chill spot in the area."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bar in Vegas. Sure, it's not as trendy or hipster-infested as some \"other\" bars in town...but that's why I like it! Unpretentious, cheap drinks and reasonably-priced, good food. 

But the main reason I like this particular PT's is that, unlike *other* PT's which are dark, gloomy caves of service industry post-shift misery and alcoholism....this PT's has floor-to-ceiling WINDOWS, letting in lots of natural light and affording an amazing view of the airport runway right across the street.

I find watching planes take off and land to be oddly meditative, and it's very pleasant to sit on the small patio outside this PT's with a drink and some noms while contemplating the mystery of flight. 

On a Friday night, it's especially fun to watch the looooong line of planes stacked up on approach into Vegas, coming in one by one like a never-ending line of lemmings jumping off a cliff into a sea of broke degeneracy. Good luck, suckas!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicer locations of this chain bar (gosh, has to be the biggest chain here). Though it's been a while, I remember this one not being so smoky and the people were a better calibur (sorry, honestly). The servers were nice. The food is pretty good as far as bar food goes (you'd be surprised at how many bars have nasty food, though). The majority of the seating was pub tables and chairs. I don't remember if there was a pool table or other games available. I do remember bumping into an old classmate from college- which if you have been here a while, will come to find out that it's a small world here."}
{"text":"I already like Mandy.  This pts property is ahead of the others because its so chill.  I never enjoyed any sierra gold, gold, pts pub, or Sean Patrick's.  This one is alright :)  the food is decent, the drinks they have are alright, the machines aren't too tight."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the service and the ruckus here.  The waitress and bartenders don't pay attention.  After asking and waiting politely, I've returned to them and they blew me off."}
{"text":"It's PT's. This location is bigger than other ones I've visited. Let me just get to the food I recently ate. 

The nachos are not 5 star or my favorite as they use the liquid cheese. But I don't have much complaints, you come and eat after a couple drinks or when hunger strikes at 2am., and by then, it is pretty good. 

The chicken strips with buffalo sauce is actually one of my favorite here. I can't believe I'm speaking such blasphemy, but, a friend of mine was shocked at how good it was. So let's just say I may not be cray cray after all. 

Pizza tastes like cardboard. I say stick with the chicken strips, tater tots (shockingly tasted like butter) and nachos (no meat is what I get). 

They have HH from 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am on drinks and maybe just the pizza. not many food options available during HH."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our server never took notes, messed up all of our orders. She never asked about the heat (spicyness of our food; nor did the menu state levels) and when it came to the tab, we had items that were messed up and taken away, and we were still charged for. The only highlight was listening to drunk people sing. Never again."}
{"text":"Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.

Rewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach purée. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it. 

Now fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf \"do you want another beer?\" Then he answered \"sure I'll take another one.\" Then she replies with \"what is it?\" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after. 

Looks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way."}
{"text":"First of all... Thank you Alicia for being an amazing bartender! Knew the bar, beer and menu by heart and very friendly. I will definitely come back. Food was great and so were the drinks."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs for half off on Memorial Day morning at 7am. Cant get better than that."}
{"text":"nice bartenders and atmosphere. so close and has pool tables to be able to play pool. Great drink specials and pizza specials for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Saturday April 30th with some friends.  The food was cold, the mild wings were so hot one of my guests could not eat them.  The waitress never advised us that if you wanted carrot sticks and Celery sticks were an extra $2.50.  As a local we advise people if its good or not.  I may give it another try after they are open a couple of months or so.
No good."}
{"text":"GO Knights GO!! Fun place to watch the game with friends and have a few drinks!! Our bartender was friendly and outgoing! Drinks came on a timely manner. We came during happy hour, as well. Place was crowded but there's always seats."}
{"text":"I've only been to a few PT's around town. They all are pretty standard Las Vegas Pubs. I wouldn't say there is anything special about them, but they are good places to watch sports. We were here to watch a bowl game with an alumni group. 
This PT's is pretty big and has lots of TVs. 

Overall it was a decent experience, but they were severely understaffed for the amount of people that were in the bar on this night. My wife and I ordered taco salads and waters. It took us almost an hour to get served. I do not blame the waitstaff as they were doing a good job, but there were only two for the entire place, and the party we were with had over 50 people. 

The taco salad was good. On this occasion I didn't drink, but i know PT's typically has a good happy hour. 

As a special note, this bar is currently an Arkansas Razorbacks bar. So if you are a fan of the hogs, this is the place to go on gameday."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I stopped here for a quick gambling session before my nail appt. I walked in and sat at a machine and was not greeted. I put money in the machine and started gambling and still had not been greeted 15 minutes later. It wasn't until the person next to me had said the bartenders name Dory that she even came over and noticed that I was sitting there and she asked me what I wanted to drink. I told her my drink order and she said okay and continued on doing everything else in the world. I put a bit more money in and still 20 minutes later have not received a drink. She kept getting everyone else in the bar a drink and doing god knows what. How hard is it to pour a beer? I ended up leaving still thirsty. Will definitely not return - that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and attentive. The bartenders know their shit which is always nice. (I've been out and had to list how to make a drink before because he didnt know. That wasn't here though.) You can play pool and hangout with friends(my personal favorite) sit at a table and relax or sit at the bar and watch the fame while enjoying a beer. The food is basic bar food but my favorites are the chicken nuggets and Gilroy pizza. A must have if you like pizza."}
{"text":"I will NEVER return to this particular location after the bad experience I had. I was here on Friday, June 23rd at around 5:30 (mind you this place wasn't even busy so crappy service shouldn't of taken place) and had the WORST experience ever. Me and my co worker came here during happy hour, we both ordered lemon drop martinis and not once were we asked what type of vodka? Don't just assume someone wants the house vodka. One thing that threw me off about our bartender was the fact that she used a straw that went in her mouth to taste the drinks??? I've never seen a bartender test a drink like this before. Maybe this is something they practice at PT's? Anyway, I asked the lady what she did with the straw and she rudely responded \"Testing the drink\". Okay? This was so strange to me and the next morning I ended up with a sore throat and so did my co worker. On top of the unusual taste testing, the bartender was constantly on her phone texting and flirting with guys that were sitting on the other side of the bar. We asked for water and literally it took 20 minutes to get, did you go to a water well or something to get our water? Very terrible service and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. Great food and great service every time. Heather has been our server. She goes above and beyond and gives us extraordinary service. She's always so attentive and is extremely friendly. We love seeing her friendly face."}
{"text":"this place is pretty cool, there is no minimum number of drinks you need to buy, and they had the knights game on when we went. they also sell cigarettes if you need them."}
{"text":"Tommy is amazing ! the reason I keep coming in great service awesome personality and he brings the luck"}
{"text":"Just spent 25 minutes sitting at the table by the kitchen, 15 feet from the bar, clear eyesore of all that worked there. 25 minutes and not an acknowledgement. Although when the bartender walked out of the kitchen and saw more people seated her response was \"shit\"! So sitting there, they pass me no less than 7 times, never a word. Never a water, a menu, a \"I'll be with you in one second\"! I will never support another PT's as this is the second time in a month at this location where we were subjected to one of the worst customer service experiences. So yes, that guy that got up after half an hour of being ignored by your pathetic staff you lost my business, and I will go out of my way to make sure word of mouth keeps people from spending their money at your place!"}
{"text":"This a PT's Gold location, for those unfamiliar with the chain it's somewhat more upscale than the typical neighborhood location. It's conveniently located in Chinatown, close to the Strip, which makes it one of the industry's favorite hangouts. Spacey enough to accommodate larger groups, it's a great place for a drink with colleagues after work."}
{"text":"1.5 stars
     Got a beer pretty quick, hence the two stars (Initial greet was quick). Feel like they are soo concerned with their switch over. 
     Most of staff kept skipping us- not even a look. Took 30 minutes & over half a beer to get a menu.
     Got better after the female bartenders left. Don't come right before switchover because I feel that the female bartenders can only concentrate on one thing at a time- smh.
     Later on the night, male bartender talks too much to one set of people. Ignores rest of the guest. 

Total time at bar. 11:30 pm- 12:55am
8/22/14-8/23/14
Total guest that came in and out: 9

Is it cuz we're the only Asians? Soo hard to find a local bar where \"everyone knows your name\". Will be going across the street on Fort Apache. 

Got a 12x12 Togo container for 5 slices to go- smh. The guy met to me got a pizza box!!!"}
{"text":"When PT's was chosen as the spot for my work HH I wasn't too excited about it, but I was pleasantly surprised with the food and atmosphere.

This location has plenty of parking in front of and near the building. The inside of the bar was really clean and smoke free. There was a variety of seating options and we easily found a table that could accommodate our group. 

Our waitress made her way to our table quickly and had drink orders out quickly. We ordered several food items and everyone noted that the food was pretty good that night. I'm not typically a \"bar food\" person, but the food hit the spot. We had Fried Pickles, The Gilroy Pizza, Nachos, and Chicken Strips. Every item was a nice portion so it was good for sharing."}
{"text":"Great new bar in the Area. Gotta love the PTs group of bars here in Vegas! Good food and service.  Need to check out the happy hour 5-7 pm and 12 am - 2 am."}
{"text":"Came here for a paint nite event and while I enjoyed paint nite, I didn't enjoy the venue.  I will avoid coming back here for a paint nite and won't be back for a regular night either.  Poor service.   The server in our room never asked my friends and I if we wanted any drinks and also skipped a lot of people in the room too.  I understand if it had taken her awhile but she just skipped us.

 The bartenders were rude, we weren't sure what to order and asked if she had any recommendations.   She just goes I have vodka, gin, rum, everything.  Well thanks for telling us what we already know but that's not what we were asking.  They weren't even busy but she acted like we were taking up her time.  I work in the service industry and would never respond to a question like she did."}
{"text":"I've been to many PTs all over the valley and this has to be my favorite. Staff is prompt, friendly and takes care of their gamblers! The other PTs food is somewhat lacking and at this one everything came out great! Super inexpensive for how big their portions are. Their beef and lamb gyro is surprisingly good for bar food as well as all their salads."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every week, for the great food, drinks, and bartenders Ashley and Claudia. 
The food is great and delivered by the awesome Terri!
The service is wonderful. 
They always greet us when we enter the door, usually remembering us by name. 
When we come in on Sundays, even when our football team loses, our day is made by Ashley and Claudia, the best bartending team in Vegas. 

Thank you and we will continue to be customers."}
{"text":"Just had the worst customer service from here. Our server's name was Caesar. My friend and I had ordered two drinks, they made them wrong. Being nice, we didn't say anything and just kept gambling. The couple next to us order the same drink we did, and they said something because it was horrible as well. So this bartender starts giving ALL of us attitude because he got called out. Said don't worry about it and grabbed the ticket crumpled it up in our face and said \"don't even fucking worry about it, I don't want to argue with you\" so the couple next to us spoke up and told him he was being a jerk. And then we were talking about how rude it was, so he gets super defensive and starts yelling at us. Called us bitches, and told us to \"get the fuck out since you won't stop talking shit\" and all we started complaining about was how rude he was. We have NEVER had someone treat us so horribly. And we refuse to go back. All we tried to do was get some decent customer service and some decent drinks and get away from our children for a little while and have a mom's evening out. And this guy ruined it. We will be calling corporate and complaining. There is no reason what so ever to treat ANY PERSON like that. And not only did he tell us to \"get out\" but the other couple left as well. Even the guy with them had to tell the bartender to leave us alone and it was uncalled for. Two other people were walking in at the same time this was happening and walked out because of how he was treating us. So not only did you lose our business, but business from FOUR other people because he decided to treat us like shit because our drinks were made bad, and the other couples drinks were made badly. Also had the nerve to tell us he didn't need our money. Right... that's why you are working at a BAR in HENDERSON. Your bartender needs to take some customer service classes and learn how to treat people, might even want to send him back to bartending school and learn how to make drinks properly."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, always clean, friendly staff and REALLY good food. Whether you like bar food or healthy salads, the food is always fresh and delicious. I love that they are open 24 hours and then I can get whatever I'm craving be it breakfast or dinner. I live right near here and I'm so glad this place opened."}
{"text":"I came in last night with A group of friends who had already been there for a little awhile. Upon arriving the server took about 10-12 minuets to come over. She automatically started pre bussing which is great! But she didn't get us drinks. I had to flag her down and ask her for drinks. 
We got our beers and 2 Shots, a few more people ordered shots as well so I asked for my check immediately after she dropped them off. I let her know we wanted our 2 beers and 4 if the shots on my check. 
She then brought us 2 more shots so I was a little surprised. Instead of having us pay for 4 Shots she just added 2 more on our check? Ok I'll drink it lol. 


Next, my friend ordered nachos. Waited, waited, waited.... she asked how much longer they would be. Her response was \"I thought you were joking\". WHAT!? Why would her asking for an order of nachos be joking? 

All around visit was a nightmare! It reminded me why I stopped going to PTs."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Pool tables, video poker, staff is amazing, super chill local crowd.   Great spot to watch some sports and have a beer or 3"}
{"text":"I want like this place because it is walking distance from the house but problem after problem. Their half off happy hour is not for \"all\" drinks like the advertising says. Corporate sent me a stack of free drink and app cards except they wouldn't let us use them. We brought friends and they were out of most of their beer. Settled for something we really didn't want. Tonight we sat in the dining room for 20 mins watching them in the bar serving people in there. I finally called them on the phone and asked the bartender to send a server. If they weren't so close with good pizza I would be totally over this place but we keep giving them one more chance. Hopefully at some point they will get their stuff together. Btw the pizzas and LVITs are great but no happy hour on specialty drinks...."}
{"text":"Good serving. Nobody outside after 12 pm. As4 me i like it. Couple beers, big pizza, salad 35-40$. Not 2 much."}
{"text":"I saw the sign that PT'S was opening soon, the anticipation for a new bar besides the 2 already in the neighborhood. Now we're here sitting down begging for drinks, never offered to sign up for the players card even though we spent $80 gambling. My bikini wrap that I asked without tomatoes and onion lacks the avocado that's clearly on the menu. Customer service is a unicorn, hard to find and something in the industry that keeps people coming back for more. Hopefully they can get it together because this is my neighborhood and I love going local..."}
{"text":"I am a fan, but best happy hour in Vegas, that about it, you get about an hour unless your double fisting, they cut the happy hour to 5-7, id say goto wahoo's for happy hour, 3-7."}
{"text":"It's a brand new place with a stupid barkeep er that takes 28 minutes to come and take an order at the bar that is almost empty,  about a dozen customers or so. When I asked her she shush ed me up with a weird hand gesture like she's chasing a fly away.... 
Too bad for the owners, cus they put some effort in this place, but except the black guy, the other bartender, there is not much in terms of professional service .
We will go somewhere else in this neighborhood, plenty of bars and booze is served faster...."}
{"text":"Not a bad PT's Gold location! 

For a PT's, the service isn't too shabby and the food is consistently decent. There are a few bartenders so you become familiar with the staff and they're all friendly. 

It opened last year so the bar's still fairly new - the inside is nice, clean, and has tavern like decor. It's never too smoky which is always a plus. There's also plenty of televisions which is nice for watching sports games!
 
I frequent this location for video poker and drinks mostly. It's right on the corner of Buffalo and Warm Springs so it's a convenient bar to meet for drinks in the Southwest part of town. 

Just don't get a dirty martini. I asked if they use any vermouth and they do not. Their olive juice tastes funny."}
{"text":"Not greeting what so ever when we walked in. We arrived around 12:00am. The waitress approached the table and stated \"ID's please\" no hello or Hi. Very uncomfortable feeling. So we left. It's sad because it's in walking distance from my house. Love their happy hour but service needs to match"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week with my buddies for happy hour. Everything is clean and new, atmosphere is nice, food is good. Hands-down the best BBQ Chicken Pizza I've ever had. Order one of those and a $3 24oz Blue Moon to wash it down. You wont leave disappointed"}
{"text":"For a place to have good drinks, play pool, and chill this is the place to go, never really super busy so service is always pretty good. Bluemoon always cold and fresh."}
{"text":"We wanted a burger today, and PT's does a pretty good one so that's where we went. We ordered their big 'o' burger- pretty solid and tasty but greasy.  I ordered twister fries for an extra $1.50 and was very disappointed with that. Really skimpy portion for the extra money. I mentioned the portion size to the server and basically got a non-response. We finished up and got the bill. $35! Plus tip over $40! I told my wife to remind me next time I suggest PT's what an absolutely horrible value it is."}
{"text":"My favorite PTs! Mark and Ray are phenomenal, and really a breath of fresh air after getting off work on the strip (and dealing with wasted tourists all night). They're both always fun to be around and attentive, always a great start to my weekend."}
{"text":"Not only was our breakfast amazing, but our server Tracie was equally as good! Great venue, great vibe, great experience!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:49 (11 minutes before happy hour ended). Got beer ordered under happy hour prices fairly quickly but waitress seemed to be in no hurry to get our food order and refused to honor happy hour prices a minute after 7:00 because \"the computer just switched\". So, we went somewhere else to eat. PTs loses a sale, waitress loses a tip, and we leave dissatisfied customers. Dumb way to do business."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Especially Jen the bartender! Never have to ask her for anything.  She knows what we wants and keeps them coming. My fav after work spot!"}
{"text":"First time here the grave yard bartender Bryan was very cool and on top of are drinks will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"I have been going to PT's for 4 years and I have never been charged for sauce. It's supposedly a new policy to charge for the flavor that comes on your wings? And when I asked our server Vanessa, she had an attitude and didn't want to deal with me and my table after I had asked her about the charge. It's not even about the money, but it's like being charged for water. We will be looking for a new place to watch our games this season."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Much better than the other 2 pts I had Wings at.  Nice bar tenders. Cold beers. Chill crowd,  great place to hang out right near home."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came in around 12:30am on 3/26/16 after a long evening at a bodybuilding competition. PT's is not my favorite place but one of the friends had a bar credit for food and drinks that night. 

We got a big table next to the pool table. Some of the group had been at the pre-judging and final competition since 8am, so we were all ravenous. Sheeri was our waitress and greeted us warmly. She was very good, I give this place an extra star because of the service. 

Four stars for great service. if I could rate the food separately that would only be 2 stars. The food, meh...it's reeeeeeeaaaallly salty, greasy bar food. We were all eating our own arms off by this time we were so hungry, so it didn't matter what was in front of us. Of COURSE everything tasted good at 1am.  We ordered a little bit of everything, pizza, fries with cheese sauce (I only was able to wrestle two fries away from the group mmm I do love that cheese sauce), wings, drinks, nachos, you name it. Everything came out very fast, and Sheeri was on top of everything. I wouldn't come here again to eat but the experience was fine."}
{"text":"The only reason my group of friends and I went here is because 3Tomatoes is closed :(  It's just OK food, nothing to write home about. Pizza is just ehh. However, the pretzel bites with nacho cheese sauce rocks!"}
{"text":"It is a chain and the menu is relatively the same from one to the other, the wings are good, salad was good service was GREAT.

So  what set this place apart from the others, our server Anna was AWESOME...she has a great sense of humor and really treats every table the same.  The bartender on that day did not have the same sense of humor and seemed annoyed having to come out from behind the bar to even talk to us.  

If not for Anna making the save this review might be a star less based on customer service.  The bar was not even busy, only 2 people at the bar but it is what it is, even with 2 people there she may have been having a bad day, it happens.  I like friendly servers and she just was not feeling it on that day.

Its all good, this location is close to a friends work so it is convenient for them so we will return."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for breakfast at this location and second time the cook here did not do well.  I orders eggs over medium and the were over hard.  It does not take a rocket scientist or someone with a degree to cook eggs, yet they were HARD.

I told the server, she did apologize and offered to have them redone....hahaha, not in a million years was I sending my plate back or having them make something new.

I came here because I was short on time and it was close, next time I will go to another location that I know they have a clear understanding on how to prepare food.

It is sad because the staff here is amazing, the Bartendar, the servers all great people, they just need a better cook...."}
{"text":"Overall nice property great TVs for watching games but definitely not a gamers bar. We will stick with shucks or the lodge in future."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been here a couple time and each has been awful.  The staff acts like you're inconveniencing them when you place an order or ask a question.  Sure true happy hours are pretty decent, but they come at a price: Terrible Service. I am new to this area and after a couple times here, definitely will not be returning.  I wish they get turn over and better management."}
{"text":"Shelly the bartender was very friendly and the new chicken parm sliders on the happy hour are to die for !!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight and was \"served\" by Rob. What a nightmare! It was almost like we had to beg for service as he dropped off our drinks and then ignored us. My friend cashed out the money he had in his poker machine simply so he could get Rob over to take our food order. A little while later the food shows up, we eat and continue to work on our drinks... we never see Rob until we flag him down for the bill. When we get the bill we notice he has charged us for our drinks and ask him why? He proceeds to throw out all kinds of attitude and says you weren't playing... only people who play get drinks comped. He then says my friend was only betting 1 credit at a time and thats not enough. Maybe if he had checked on us once in a while he would have seen that we both had money in the machine and were playing the whole time...I know I lost $40 that should more than cover the 1 beer I drank. The sad thing is that if he would not have acted like a major jerk I would not be so upset. When you work on tips your service is what makes you money. Yelp says I have checked into PT's 33 times... I'm pretty sure Rob has helped me more than a few times and I have always played while I was here. To accuse me and my friends of trying to cheat him out of a free beer is unacceptable. I know now why this place is empty all the time."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry this is not the place to come.  If you may be slightly pressed on time don't come here. The food is great. Sadly we waited for a good 30 minutes AFTER we were done eating to get some attention to ask for the check. As I type this we are still waiting and have yet to pay. We have been here for 1 hour 45 minutes just for dinner.  The waitress is nice enough but clearly they're understaffed. I think she's doing the serving, cleaning, bussing and washing dishes on her own. So frustrating to have good food end on such a bad note."}
{"text":"Jen let me order an egg on a pizza without any judgement. I am happy today because of it."}
{"text":"Walter is an awesome bartender! Super polite and attentive. I would highly recommend going in on one of his shifts!!!"}
{"text":"So I don't really frequent a lot of bars.....JK....yes I do!!!! I've been to quite a few living here on the west side of Vegas, but I always come back to this PT's in particular......it's close by...the bartenders know my name....AND THE MAIN REASON I KEEP COMING BACK HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!! Especially from DIDA!!! If you ever come to this PT's ask for DIDA to be your server!!! SHE IS THE BEST!!! She is always on point with EVERYTHING.....I never have to wait to get my drinks refilled or have my table cleared...even with leftover food she has a take home container ready and waiting!!!! So thank you Dida and thank you to the PT's on 215/Buffalo for always making me feel at home!!!"}
{"text":"Amanda was great. Served us with a smile everytime. Made sure we always had a drink in hand. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Went here for a Paint & Wine night with the girls. It was fun. We got here early to get our grub on and it was perfect timing for happy hour. I forgot what we ordered but every thing we got was good. 

Then we went into the event area. The server was the same one who served us in the bar. She was ok. She was a bit slow, took a while to get our drinks."}
{"text":"Went in for drinks n got a little hungry. The graveyard bartender, I believe his name was James, was really nice and mentioned happy hour pizza; said they were half priced til 2am! Ordered a pizza and it was out in a good time. The bartender not only made sure we had everything we needed, but even came back a couple times to make sure it was good and we were enjoying it.
You don't get great, attentive service from bartenders very often, but this one surpassed my expectations. He was great!!! For sure coming back to this location to see this guy again."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!! Such a great staff and I can't tell u about the AMAZING things they do for their customers. Cesar is one of my favorite bartenders he went above and beyond to help celebrate my birthday got me a cake and a balloon can't tell u how much that meant to me, he really made my day! Definitely my neighborhood bar and ALL the bartenders are fantastic. If u wanna have a good time come n check this bar out, you won't be disappointed! Thanks to the staff at PTs Horizon u guys are GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out ever since my personal beer expert buddy/coworker told me it opened a couple of months ago. I decided that game 1 of the World Series would be a good enough excuse.

If you know anything about PT's Pub and Sierra Gold, think of this place as somewhere in between the two. It has a nice sized dining area that is separate from a fairly large bar area. They also have an upstairs area that I didn't check out. On this occasion, with the bar being pretty full, I picked a table towards one of the corners.

Our server, Dida, was extremely friendly and helpful - probably one of the nicest servers I've ever had. After she read off the list of beers on tap, I went with the Ranger IPA. She mentioned it had a hint of lychee. I totally tasted it on my first sip, but maybe that was because I was looking for it.

Their happy hour is the same as all other PT's and Sierra Golds. From 3-7pm (and midnight-4am), you get half off drinks and pizzas. I must say that they have some pretty freakin' delicious pizza. Dida recommended the Gilroy and it did not disappoint. My friends also ordered a BBQ Chicken and that was good too. I think you're supposed to sign up for their Beer & Bites membership, but in the end, Dida gave us the HH price without me having to sign up for anything."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. We waited 20 minutes for drinks (we asked for 16oz happy hour and they gave us 25oz mugs) and over an hour for our food. Asked for no green chille on a sandwich that they \"cut in half\" and got them, grilled onions on a burger they came raw, the French fries were greasy limp and under cooked and the French dip was more ground beef then finely sliced. Our waitress never checked on us and when we got the bill they upcharged us for 25oz mugs that we didnt ask for! They even took 15 minutes to run our card because their system went down. They did seem really under staffed but to be honest the place was not busy. The manager comped some of our bill but we won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Taylor is no longer there at this location.Linda is a cocktail server and A waitress and does an excellent job and is very helpful.Linda is personable and very nice and attentive and very pleasant and keeps us coming back and is always there to help and is an asset to this place and the reason we go here"}
{"text":"We have not been to PT's very often in the year  and one  half we have lived here. After going Tuesday evening, this is the reason why. Every single time we have tried this place (our only other choice is Rounders), the smoke has been so thick it is impossible, sickening even, to eat there. And I'm a former smoker! WTF! Rounders has smokers. Not nearly as bad and far more patrons there. Balboa at GV District has machines, no smoking at all. We just returned from  Europe; everyone smokes there! But outside! And with courtesy! I will never go again. And it's too bad because the food is actually pretty good and the server was very courteous. Lose the smoking on the inside and maybe you will have more patrons. Go outside people."}
{"text":"Never again! I've tried out multiple PTs and every single time they charge me even while I am gambling. You have to actually bring it up to the bartender for them to comp your drinks while you are gambling. Putters is such a better group than PTs. How was it possible that I was $400 in gaming and had 1 beer and 2 shots and still managed to have a tab?"}
{"text":"This neighborhood tavelhas been a favorite of ours for 7yrs even though the staff has change in a few months the food still is considerablyh reason for ordering from! and the new bartenders are great customer service friendly mind you! Beware of graveyard bartender very rude service and watch .. his free acting none friendly friend blowing haystack or smoke out of his mouth! blowing literally to get us out! Well he succeed 5 of us left & I didn't know them ! Don't let the door kick you? He said! Really PTs needs to screen their ppl better especially graveyard bartenders may need to weigh your bottles again Jsayin"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, PT's has great food. Yes its a chain bar, but this chain bar actually has one of my favorite simple things to eat.

I order their Cobb salad and a bucket of chicken wings - crispy & dry. I get three sauces on the side: Buffalo Medium, Sweet Chile & Asian BBQ. Of course I do blue cheese dressing instead or ranch :)

The combination of the super fresh salad and the wings is deliciously good. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Drinks were good and decent prices. Food was served hot and fresh. I had the chicken breast and I ate the whole thing. My friend did not like her French dip(had too much cheese) and they were nice enough took that off her tab. Chill spot to go with a few friends to have a drink and a small meal. Has TVs around to watch fights and sports. I like it."}
{"text":"I go to PTs mostly to watch NBA or Football games. But the last time I went the service was terrible at PTs Gold on 3770 S Hualapai Way, Las Vegas, NV 89147 & 7200 W Lake Mead Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89128. I sat at table for at least 20 minutes before anyone took my order. At Hualapai they at least got me a beer to wait but at Lake Mead I could not even get a beer. Both times the current bartender was waiting on shift change so she was stalling."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into a PT's i don't know what to expect as they are each somewhat different. Came here to watch a basketball game and had a good time. The happy hour menu is similar to all other PT's where they served fried food for cheap. Certain premium liquor cocktails are priced at 6.25 during HH, and beers are in the 4 dollar range. 

This PT's was nicely decorated with a lot of new furniture, there are little private lounge sections and there are TV's in there as well. Pool tables are also available for rent if one wished to play. One thing though, was that the TVs at the bar were quite small. Mostly 32 and 40 inches, which can be considered a computer monitor size in 2016.

Another plus is when it is gametime, they put the game's audio throughout the place, rather than music, so it makes it even better if you're trying to catch a sports event.

Our bartender was quite attentive as she was in charge of the whole bar, although it was kind of a quiet evening. As for food, we ordered the Nachos and a entree salad, and both were well made. The nachos here are very good and the salad.. well a salad is a salad (Classic Cobb). 

Another thing I need to mention is the ventilation in this place, it is very strong. To those complaining about second hand smoke, may I remind you that this is a tavern. People smoke at taverns. The ceiling is high enough and the ventilation is strong enough where smoke shouldn't be too much of a matter if one is not extremely sensitive to smoke. If you were, you shouldn't be in a tavern in the first place.

I will simply say, I will return."}
{"text":"I usually go to either the PT's on pecos/sunset or the PT's Ranch Eastern/Pebble, but we happen to be in the area of this one and felt like trying it out.  We came in here around 5p and there was only 2 other people in here.  It has a nice layout and was very clean like most of the other ones.  The drawbacks we had was mostly due to the staff.  The Cook was just hanging out at the table by the end of the bar watching t.v.  The bartender staff was talking about how mad they were over their schedule and that it was switched from what it was at first.  They kept talking about it over and over for about 20 mins until finally some of them left.  I understand that sometimes your schedule gets changed but please dont bring it up in front of the customers.  We come here to relax and not listen to all your problems.  Our bartender Ryan was nice but wasn't very personable due to being occupied with the other staff members."}
{"text":"I've passed this PTs a couple of times & have been waiting to come in since it opened a month ago or something like that. Came in around 6 on a Wednesday for happy hour! I believe happy hour starts at 5 and ends at 7 - drinks are half off & selected $5 appetizers. 

I ordered the chicken fries and a snakebite & we had a gilroy pizza for the table. The chicken fries were bomb! I'm not sure if they offer this appetizer at other locations or if it's new but definitely try it out. Tastes just like the one from Burger King! The gilroy pizza always hits the spot. I'm not sure what's all in there but it has sausages & it goes well with alcohol lol. The snakebite was good, can't really mess up beer you know. 

The service was alright, wasn't exceptional like how others made it seem. The establishment looks much bigger from the outside but it's pretty small when you come in. I'm a little sad that they don't really have any darts or pool tables or anything. It's the closest PTs to my home so I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I love PT's happy hour (5-7 or 12-2AM)! It's really cheap, so the perfect place for all college people struggling to adult. During happy hour, they have appetizers for $5. I really like their fried pickles! They have 4 items on there, I believe. I think I'm gonna try the chicken fries (I suspect this is kinda like the ones from Burger King??). & the gilroy pizza... Is a must have! The drinks are pretty much always made well. I did try a Jameson shot with a pickle back... & im not sure I'm gonna be adventurous next time lol. 

Every time I go to this location I only ever get served by this one lady, idk her name. She's really nice & awesome customer service! This location also has a little patio! I don't think I've seen that at other PT's. 

I don't like how the place wreaks... But I mean that's how every bar is, I feel like. Lol. Will definitely be coming back, especially since it's just down the street!"}
{"text":"We arrived a bit later in the evening for dinner and met up with some friends. The bar was packed, however, the dining area was empty. We opted for the dining room to avoid the smoke, but it's terribly designed and perhaps not well-ventilated as the cigarette smoke was very apparent.

Being rather familiar with the PT's Entertainment Group portfolio and its food, I went for familiar items such as the Golden Wings and Coo-Coo Fries. Both were good! We also got the Pizza Tots; the menu shows Potato Skillets, but you can substitute any type of fry and choose various toppings. They were tasty with Italian sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella, and marinara sauce.

Service was just okay. We rarely saw any staff, so there were a few long waits to get what we needed. On one occasion, I wandered around in an attempt to get someone's attention as that particular wait was bordering obnoxious. Even when our server was with us, she wasn't very attentive which created order mishaps. It was nothing serious, but the whole experience was displeasing. It reminded me why I haven't been to any PT's establishment in almost four years.

Their food has usually been decent and I'm typically content with the dishes (obviously sticking to the traditional bar food), but service has always been so shoddy! It's truly a shame because their locations are EVERYWHERE and so convenient. If I were to visit again due to a hankering of bar food and convenience, I would just have to remember to set my expectations low."}
{"text":"My fav. PT's in town! 

PT's is so hit or miss...typically I'm let down but this one never lets me down (: 

Decent food- standard chain bar food but still tasty and decent.

Good service and great vibe. 
My boyfriend and I love the patio seating here; fire-pits and all."}
{"text":"Worst service in Las Vegas. Sitting here with no drinks , asked for our bill multiple times. Last time I come here. I gave it 4 times and I'm done."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing food and amazing service! Found a new Vegas strip which is off the strip. Pizza, chicken wings, and fried mozzarella were all mouth watering! The drinks were we'll made. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Love, love, love! A great spot for sports lovers to hang out and eat and drink."}
{"text":"Great staff. Best PT's in town. Very friendly staff and good enough food to be a stand alone restaurant. Thank you PT's !!"}
{"text":"I went here for their opening party last week and had a good time until a customer service nightmare at the end. I went out of town the next day and am just getting around to the review, and judging from what I'm reading in other reviews I'm not the only one that had issues with rude bartenders here.

First off, I love PTs bars and have been a regular at their PTs at Desert & Eastern and Vegas Valley & Nellis for years. What keeps me going to PTs is their great happy hour prices and great customer service (tonight being a glaring exception). Most of the bartenders that work for them are great!

My wife and I go to every opening because it's a cool party atmosphere and we often see friends that work for PTs that we know. Plus they have $50 match play, which is awesome for gamblers like me. We went to the opening of the new location on Martin just a week earlier and had a great time. The Manager there, Susan, is one of the best bartenders I've ever known.

Now this PTs on Silverado Ranch looks like most of their new locations, which is to say it's pretty nice inside with lots of HD tvs to watch sports on. As with every opening, the bar was packed and there was a waiting list for the machines. We walked in at 6pm and had to wait a little over half an hour for machines.

My hats off to the Manager (think the name was Amanda, sorry if I got it wrong), who was very friendly and did the best job of handling the wait list of any opening I have seen.

I had two large draft beers (one of which was their house red) before I was able to get a machine. I then played for about 1.5 to 2 hours, averaging over a dollar play the whole time. My wife played as well, and she doesn't drink and just had water. I had two more beers over the course of my play, and we started to say bye to everyone when a bartender reminded us we had a tab.

My bad on forgetting I bought those two beers before I started gambling. I had a good buzz going and am always gambling when I'm at a bar, so I'm used to not having a tab. I apologized and asked for my check. The bartender was a younger Caucasian woman with long black hair (I should have got her name) she hadn't seemed friendly but as busy as they were that's understandable.

So I get a check for over $40, when we didn't have food and I only should have had to pay for two drinks. She tells me I had five beers, and I tell her I had four, only two before I started playing. She then argues with me that it was five. I was buzzed, but not drunk enough to forget how many I'd had. My sober wife also saw how many I had, and even commented when I had my Fourth that she would definitely be driving now.

So she tells me she will only take two beers off for my play and hands me a check for $24. She was pure bad attitude with us and rude. I told her that even if I'd had five beers (which I hadn't) my wife and I had been playing for long enough to justify the comp, and she then told me we didn't have sufficient play. I was floored. The place was packed, and I didn't see the manager anywhere, so we paid and left as we wanted to go to a friends house who lives nearby.

It wasn't until after we left I realized that they were doing happy hour all day, so what's with the $8 a beer on that check? And why would you plan on charging someone for drinks when you saw them gambling consistently? I honestly think that she may have partially mixed me up with another customer since I did change machines at one point. But she was so condescending that I had no want to argue with here over a few dollars. 

If your slammed in an opening, you should be doing your best to make a good impression and realize you can make mistakes. I felt ripped off and will probably email their corporate office on this one. I only gave them a second star because of the nice Manager. Whoever the bartender is that has no customer service skills and ripped me off needs to go."}
{"text":"This brand new PTs is a lot nicer than most. Great service here, and staff is what matters.

They just opened and they have lots of nice HD TVs to watch sports. Great beer and great happy hour specials.

The Manager Susan is really awesome. Can't ask for someone else better to be in charge of this place."}
{"text":"The Rum Bull Cocktail was good. The taste reminded me of the Fanta orange soda with a hint of alcohol. The mac and cheese bites were bomb af. The service was good but it could do a lot more better."}
{"text":"I came into this PTs with a group of my friends and our server Anthony was absolutely amazing!! He was incredibly attentive, personable, and quick. He defiantly took our experience here to the next level! If you come in ask to be seated with Anthony, he's without a doubt a 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today. We ordered the chicken quesadillas & the grilled chicken sandwich. Food was delicious, generous portions & service was friendly."}
{"text":"Best PT's I've been to thus far. Not too crowded and it's nice and clean a not to mention Mike is the greatest bar tender I've ever met in my life . Very very very cool guy ! He deserves to work in someone's casino as a bartender. My boyfriend and I ordered 30 piece wings, lemon pepper and extra hott, SOO BOMB, surprisingly we killed the whole bucket, I was impressed by there wings . Not I mention their happy hour from 12am-2am.. We will definitely be returning !! It is a must"}
{"text":"If you want a funny bartender, or if you want a bartender to save your life....ask for Frank.  I witnessed Frank give a customer the Heimlich maneuver.  I think the customer was choking on a chicken wing bone, or a mozzarella stick...not sure?  Worst part...the customer was not really appreciative that Frank saved his life......"}
{"text":"A new PT's located off of the 95 and Lake Mead Blvd. I tried the hangover tots-sausage gravy with over medium fried eggs, wow it was great! A greasy  breakfast treat! This place is newly remodeled with multiple TV's for sports viewing.  Over 12 beers on tap and a wide variety of spirits available. Lots of friendly staff and great bar food. Must stop in!"}
{"text":"Great staff!!  Food leaves a bit to be desired, though.  The staff is the main reason we come here because they are all great.  Typical machines, but the PT's players club is among the worst I have seen.  If you are looking for a place to have a drink and relax, this is a winner.  If you are hungry or want to gamble and get a return on your money, no!

Biggest problem with the food is if the fryer goes out, so does 90% of their menu.  The last thing I want with an alcohol hangover is a grease hangover as well.

If you are in a bind or on a diet, they do have one or two wraps as well as a few decent pizzas."}
{"text":"Great location, food and service. Been here three times. Pretzel bites are awesome and so is the cookie desert. The Mango Maggie drink is delicious. Great atmosphere. A+"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food is okay. 

Ordered hot wings and chose lemon pepper/mild flavor. Salty wings. Lemon pepper is the worse I've had. Couldn't even taste the lemon pepper. It was more salt. I asked for crispy and they were under cooked.  Pizza was okay. Their beers are good but I'm truly not a beer drinker. 

Local franchise and new bar in the neighborhood. Second time here since it opened. Ambiance is boring and very bright. When I'm in town, Maybe I will come back here if Distill is crowded."}
{"text":"This literally right around the corner from my parent's and I LOVE their happy hour.
All drinks 50% off from 5-7pm (I think that's the hours) and from 12am-2am. 

Whenever I visit Vegas, I'll make it a priority to come here for my drinking needs. 

Only discrepancy was that I had a lil issue with the staff a couple times. 
The blonde bartender gave me an Adio MF drink but I saw a gnat in it! I had to get it returned. 
The next day, I tried doing a cash advance on my credit card and I guess you have to do it at the ATM and then give the staff your receipt and then you'll get your money. Well, at the time, I was waiting for my CA driver license in the mail, so I just had that paper temporary license. But I also had my old GA license (that technically didn't expire for another two years) and my military ID but they refused to give me my cash because they owner said he's been ripped off like that before. Whatever. Not gonna make a huge deal out of it. I just like their happy hour. That's it."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the PTs chain of bars. Happy hours are great and the food always good. We like to come in and grab some potstickers, wings and fries, nachos, drink a couple beers. This location was clean and the food tasty. Our service was not bad, nobody was really friendly or personable though. We felt more like we were intruding and customers shouldn't feel that way. We probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"On February 17, 2018 my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go out for breakfast.  We tried to call PT'S to see if by any chance we could take our one year old since they do have a dining area.  No one picked up the call, so I actually went on yelp and it stated that it was kid friendly we took our chances and went. (It's literally right behind our house). When we walked in we saw a sign and it stated must be 21 or older to enter. We still went in and an employee starts shouting \"oh no, no . no! You can't come in I don't know if yall read that big sign when you walked in saying 21 or over?\"  I shouted back yes I did read & see it but wanted to know if we were allowed to eat by the dining area, I told him he didn't have to be rude. That I had looked up if it was kid friendly told him they should go on sites and update or confirm their info. Please keep in mind this guy (bartender or whatever his job title may be) is yelling/shouting by the end of the bar and we are at the entrance. There was a gentleman drinking by the bar and another couple at the left hand side on a table. I understand it's a bar I totally get it, but why couldn't this person walk up to us and say \"hey sorry but unfortunately no kids are allowed\" how hard can that be? There was no need for everyone in that building to know we were getting kicked out or for him to cause a big scene. FYI I been to bars where they have sections where you can bring your family to eat. I guess I learned the hard and embarrassing way that pts is not family orientated. They need to learn how to give good customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a local race to share in some celebratory drinks.  Walked in and noticed the festive atmosphere which was a nice and warm touch. The bar was fairly open so we sat there.  The bartender tended to us quickly and got our drink order in a timely manner.  He made sure to give us our space but checked up once or twice to make sure we were doing ok.  The place was quiet which made talking easy.  We didn't stay long but the time there was great.  Will go back with friends to have another great drink and conversation."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for cold beer and a good pizza. Happy hour is the time. Their nachos are good as well. Had my first French Dip today... Not so good... Hot dog bun with a little bit of meat. Swiss Cheese is extra... WTH? Still hungry..."}
{"text":"I had the most ridiculous experience I EVER had at a PT's. The service is horrible.

My friends & I went to PT's only because the original bar we went to was packed for the Golden Knights game.

It was before happy hour was over at 6:57 p.m. & I went straight up to a server, Kristian, to put an order in. I wanted two Midori Sours & a Gilroy pizza. Our conversation went: \"Okay. What's a Midori Sour?\" \"The green drink.\" \"What's in it so I can put that in the order? Like what alcohol is in it?\" With a confused look, I said \"... Midori.\" I was trying to order quickly so I just settled for a different drink. I asked what drinks can I order & she said, \"they have everything.\" Okay?! I need to know the ingredients in order to order one?! I settled for a Jameson & Ginger Ale, while my friend I was with got a Jack & Coke, & another Gilroy pizza. Yes, this was all by 7 p.m.

As my friends started coming in, they put in their drink orders. My friend ordered a Snakebite. She asked him the same question of what was in it & he stated that it was 1/2 Cider & 1/2 Beer. I was so confused to why she needed to know what was in drink as if the bartender doesn't know that. All my friends who came after I ordered got their drinks before I did. My friend who ordered the Snakebite only got the \"bite\" as he says because his drink was all Cider so he had to fix his order at the bar. When I got my Gilroy pizza, my friend who also put in an order for one didn't get his & she said she only put in one. He passed on getting one.

She didn't do well with keeping up with our drink orders so people went to the bar if necessary. Then when we got our checks & I told her how to split it, I noticed my check wasn't given happy hour prices. I asked her why & she said it was because we came after 7 p.m. I stated no, we were here just before 7 p.m. & I ordered just in time for happy hour. She said when she put the order in, it was after 7 p.m. & she shares a register with another server so it could have taken time. That made no sense to me because how is that my fault. I was so over her at that point that I said whatever & paid my check.

It was my first & last time at this location. PT's raised their prices as well. It's just not a go-to place anymore."}
{"text":"Consistently good pub food at pts ... BBQ chicken pizza, 2 beers, carrots and celery. Love it. Wait staff her was quick and friendly . Plenty of TV s on baseball on a MNF night. Will be back"}
{"text":"We usually only go during the evening but we decided to have a late night drink...service was not great by the bartender dj he wasn't very friendly at all...the service is not great at all very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good pot stickers ,salads and burgers. .. chicken wings, Pizza, Great late night staff. Pool tables."}
{"text":"Lol came in on a weds food Ok,  beer good as any place.  Never seen so many guys in a bar in my whole life.  3 stars for service. Watching people walk out not getting help."}
{"text":"This location just opened recently and it's very nice inside. Depending on who you get the service has been average to very good for a place like this. I have been to about 5 different PT's around the city and this one is the nicest, it has high ceilings and a good layout and it's still nice and new inside."}
{"text":"I'm giving this PTs 5 starts because I love this bar and Cesar, John, and Josh are all great and attentive."}
{"text":"Bartenders are rude and play favorites. I am a server and a great tipper but not at this location. Last time I went in I was charged for drinks even while max betting. While the alcoholic friend of the bartender next to me was getting free drinks left and right. She was talking about her last dui to a man next to her and the bartender knew most of the story as well. I'm guessing the drunk one worked there because she even went into the kitchen once. At one point she had to run to the restroom and left me with her purse!!! I don't even know her!! I wouldn't even have a problem with that if the bartender wouldn't have been so rude. I told her I have never been charged for all my drinks and her response was \" well then the other bartenders weren't doing their jobs\" gives me a nasty face and walks away. I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"We went to this PT's on saturday for drinks and lunch.  There were three of us.  The service was terrible.  We each only had two drinks, ordered food and two of us were gambling.  We spent $70.00 on gambling.  Nothing was comped.  We were charged full price for our drinks and food.  I also requested a new players card.  We would have had more drinks but it was like pulling teeth to even get their attention to order anything.  The bartenders had a shift change while we were there and the second one was worse then the first one.  And... the bar was slow that day so it wasn't like they were too busy.   I think I will just stay on my side of town in future and drink at Putters."}
{"text":"Quality food and great service. Our waitress Julie was most helpful and friendly. The fish and chips are top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to meet at a different PT's about once a week so we met at the Anthem location night. My wife was there when I got there at 6:15. She had ordered me a beer which was waiting when I got there. In the 10 minutes after I got there the waiter came by twice and we told him we'd let him know when we were ready to order. Bad mistake as we like to take advantage of 1/2 price pizza. The waiter never came back so my wife went to the bar to order at 6:45 and was told to sit down and waiter would be there. 6:58 came and waiter assumed we wanted more beers and when my wife tried to tell him we wanted to order food, he held his finger up and said just a minute and walked away. When he came back I said we tried to order a pizza before 7 and he said it's too late. I became angry and told him to bring our bill. He brought the bill and tried apologizing just in time for his tip. Not sure how he has a job and bartender wasn't much better."}
{"text":"Kristen was an excellent server. She's friendly and can work multiple tables with ease. Very impressed."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the happy hour menu. Visited PT's during their midnight happy hour and I have to say the SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES is heaven sent! Perfect little chicken balls with just the right amount of sriracha breading. Order that, ask for the sweet chili sauce (recommended by the bartender) on the side with a full pint of blue moon and your night is made. 

Flat bread pizza had good taste but I'd prefer it to be a little thinner and crunchier than what I got but that's just me. Loaded potato skins were pretty good, too. Haven't tried the other ones in the menu though. 

Oh, did I say get the SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES?! It's the type of dish that you will definitely crave for every so often. Okay, gonna go get some now!"}
{"text":"Wow... 5 bucks for one game of pool on an unleveled table... It was a five minute game and very upsetting that the table was in that poor of condition... Some manager bartender she is... Customer Service at pts has really gone down over here... I'll return when she's not here."}
{"text":"This is just another PT's chain that doesn't take care of their customers or players. I just put in 160$ to their machines. I had one tall beer and three shots of jäger two of which another person ordered. I received a bill for 39$. Sorry PT's but I will never be back and I will make sure all of my construction friends go elsewhere to blow their checks."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes sitting at a table after the waitress had brought us water. Nobody ever came back to take our order! The service at this place is a fucking joke!! We got here before the basketball game started and they decided to serve people who got here halfway past the first quarter before us!! This was our first and last visit to this place. We will never return back!! There are way too many options nearby with quality service!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for some time.  Always great service!! Bartenders are always friendly and I get great service.  Food is bar food, if I want gourmet Ill go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what it is with PT's, but they always seem to be understaffed no matter which one I go to at any given time. It took about 12 minutes to be greeted and my girlfriend and I sat at the bar. Like, wut. 
We were going to order food and possibly more than 1 drink, but that's all that was offered considering we spoke with her once and that was to simply get our initial drink order. Another 20 minutes passes and we just thought, we could've already eaten at the Sonic Drive Thru as well as gotten our own drinks at the local Maverick gas station, so we went and did just that. 
Never we going back, and I legit live across the street. Just not worth the wait, especially if you actually want to eat."}
{"text":"I've been to PTs twice in the last week. I only come for there happy hour at midnight. I hate that it's only 2 hours now when it used to be 12-4! You kind of have to rush drinking before it ends and you have to pay full price. I had there boneless wings the other day they were ok the food isn't amazing. Overall I like it here though."}
{"text":"Since when do they charge 2.50 for a pineapple back for my vodka shot ?? Lady was rude will never go back !!

Just an update I called another location because i was curious to see what she would say and this manager, Jodi told me that it depends on the manager or location.  I thought all PTs would be the same.  I have been to many bars and infact work in the industry and have never been charged for a back.  This may seem petty but the way Jamie, was treating us wasn't.  She was rude from the min my friends and i got there.  Got our order wrong and then when we asked for another back like we had originally ordered came back with, \" well
You need to pay for these anyways\"
And brought us an extra one which we did not order."}
{"text":"There is literally a bar on every corner in Las Vegas but I will always choose to come to this one over any of them. Mostly it's for happy hour (4pm-7pm & 12am-3am) which is half off of ALL DRINKS and pizza. You can not beat that price anywhere!!! Make sure to sign up for their PT's card. One time my girlfriend and i had like 35 shots of Jameson (yea we're pretty crazy) and the bill was less than $50, now THAT is crazy. The best pizzas are the Gilroy & the Spicy Buffalo Chicken. They have a full menu as well with your standard yummy bar food. 

My man frequently plays their machines and he has come up several times so I know their machines are pretty loose too. There is also a sports parlay machine in the corner. 

This PTs is a very clean & modern PTs complete with a dining room, 2 billiards tables, a patio, a little semi private couch area and tons of tvs. They also usually charge $10/person for when they screen fights on the weekends and it gets packed! The crowd here is a good mix of young and older peeps. 

When you go here make sure to tip your bartenders and servers well. Especially the bald bartender, Christos, he's my favorite! Tell him Julie sent you and he'll take care of you ;]]] Also Alex the red head, tell her she looks like Emma Stone, she loves it! HAHA 

The only negative things I can think of are that they don't really comp your drinks when you gamble and most of the time they don't have top shelf alcohol. 

But all in all, you definitely need to check this place out.. you're guaranteed to walk out with a smile~"}
{"text":"Unfortunately must leave a negative review-
Granted, come to find out that this location has a reputation of being atrocious during the weekends; but still it does not excuse the incident.
After waiting for about 10 minutes to be even acknowledged- probably could've gone behind the bar and poured ourselves drinks for that 10 minutes because there was literally NO STAFF PRESENT FOR THE ENTIRE TINE- we we met with a waitress whom took or drink orders and we advised we were waiting for 1 more.
She came back and asked if we were ready to order.....knowing we were waiting for 1 more and seeing they hadn't gotten there.......
We told her hold on 1 second while we checked the persons location, she seemed irritated, so we went ahead and ordered.  During the first order it was almost like since there was more than 1 question it was like she became even more irritated and we were apparently a burden to her.
Our buddy arrived about 10 minutes after that and placed his order about 5 minutes after arriving 
30 minutes later our food came out (minus the late arrival) and not only was it slightly cold, but 1 order was wrong.  When it was told to the waitress it had the wrong sauce, she said- we don't have that sauce so I put in the closest thing to it-------- most proper waiters/resses would've come back and made you aware of the issue PRIOR to putting in an incorrect order.
She then began to act as though it was our fault the order was wrong and she grabbed a menu and slammed it on the table saying \"show me where\".
Needless to say- we probably will never be going back to his location ever again.

As for the food-  well, my Philly Cheese steak, while it had ok flavor, was cold and the cheese sauce was horrific, the bread was also soggy, the \"coco\" fries were actually just regular fries (cold and tasted pre-made) with season-all seasoning sprinkled lightly on top-  
Definitely not worth even $5 let alone the listed menu price- and definitely shouldn't take 30 minutes to make."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour and it's usually not too crowded.  It is a favorite hang out for most of my friends since they all live in that neighborhood.  The food is really good, too.  I've had the pizzas and the wings, both of which were delicious.  The service is always good. 

They have pool tables and an area with couches where you can just chill a little away from the bar.  There are a ton of TVs so it's perfect for watching sports.  There is also a really nice patio for when it gets warmer outside.  This is definitely a fun spot and I'd hang out more if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Bartenders are always friendly. The cook is excellent. Happy hours have greasy prices. But outside of happy hour, it's cheaper to lose 40 bucks in the machines than to run a beer tab."}
{"text":"Ah, you guys, this place isn't that bad.  I have had a good time several times in here.  The staff are decent, drink prices are average, but happy hour 7 days a week, that in itself deserves 3 stars!  There pizza's are good.  My one complaint is that there seems to be quite a turnover with the staff, at least from the dozen or so times I've been there."}
{"text":"We came here friday afternoon for the HH. They have 50% off drinks from 4-7. My bf and his friend took advantage of all 3 of those hrs. I got there around 5:30. The total for all 3? $56.00. Yes  not bad. Had we been at most other places it would have been double that. We walked about a block over and went to BWW. It was a good time. I was surprised the girls took my order but as my bf pointed out, this was PT's Gold, not Sierra gold... ah... well played. 
i'd come back. definitely. the drinks were good and strong, not watered down like most places."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here when we were staying @ the Orleans. It was kinda full and I think it was b/c UT was playing.duh... We shared a pep. pizza with jalapenos and it was delic. we killed it eventhough it was prob. enough for 3. It was that good. I saw a girl next to me eating what i was orig. going to order  the chili dog combo with curly fries. OMG she killed it! It looked so good but I have yet to order that b/c I always want to order the pizza instead. This place is always full of locals and it seems really cool to hang out. The guy on the other side of me was playing the bar poker and got 4 aces and asked me, \"Is that good?\" I wasn't sure if he was being sincere or sarcastic? WTH. really? I just had to laugh. I think he was trying to hit on me but wasnt sure what to open with.. um ok kind old drunk guy. IT was precious. I'd def. go back more often if I lived closer but these bars are spread out all over the valley. If you haven't partaken... Partake."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before, I've seen them all over Las Vegas but I never went inside. I decided to take myself on a date and check it out. I didn't have an pre-conceived notions about PTs so I didn't expect much of anything. 

I love that they have darts and pool tables for the pool sharks. The bar was very clean and although there weren't many people inside, it looked as if it were running smoothly, almost effortlessly. 

I ordered a Long Island iced tea, crown royal on the rocks and I had a gorilla salad (I made it vegan of course). The Long Island wasn't anything special I felt like $9 was a bit much for what I was presented but what I loved most about this PTs at this location was the customer service. 

There's a guy named Mike and I'm. It sure what the bartenders name was but she was very nice as well. I went in alone but they made me feel welcome and made sure my orders were done correctly and they even took a little off of my tab. 

Although the cigarette smoke was irritating and simply disgusting To have to smell while you're eating. Mike made up for it, with his exceptional customer service skills. I would definitely comeback maybe during happy hour to enjoy drinks and shoot some pool.

That made me feel at home and comfortable which goes a looooooon way with me."}
{"text":"Dude so Michael aka mikey and al are the best !!' This was my best PTs experience yet ... not only was it personalized but the drinks were on point and I also was stopped from going off while still tipsey the nachos were delicious and overall
This is my fav PTs so far!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I took 4 of my employees here for pizza , wings and a couple beers for the ones who drink.  The waitress was nice to us however I will not be revisiting this place.  We ordered a bucket of wings, a large pizza and a basket of fries.  The wings were split up in 3 flavors.  One of the flavors a guy picked was garlic Parmesan.  They were terrible.  All 5 of us tried it and all agreed they were gross.  When we brought it up the waitress told us well you'll know for next time.  Then we needed 4 more ranch.  The lady went and got them for us.  I get the bill and was charged $0.75 per ranch.  It's ridiculous to me that I spent $111 on food and $20 on 3 beers and had to pay extra for 4 ranch.  Again the waitress was nice but I believe this place is caught up by the corporate garbage.  I will not be back and do not recommend a place that feels the need to not offer a different option when 5 people tell them a certain part of the order was terrible or makes you pay for extra dipping sauce as if they didn't already make enough profit."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this PT's which we visit at least twice a month.  We've never had the food tasting so awesome! There wasn't one item to complain about! Honestly, this is the best cook this location has had and we've been coming here since it opened.  Brandon is his name and unfortunately, he was an on-call shift today. If this location is serious about improving their current 2 STAR RATING, they'd be wise to keep Brandon as their permanent cook!  Order came out correct just as we ordered it, the first time. We've sent back orders before at this PTs but Brandon is right on top of things...we ordered nachos, chicken wings and steak quesadilla...all prepared to perfection. He obviously takes pride in his career...there should be more cooks like Brandon.  Hopefully , PT's wakes up and keeps him here.  That's the way to improve the rating...I know my rating is high due to our experience today.  Great service and excellent food! Kudos to Brandon."}
{"text":"Thank goodness, I can drink and walk home. 
IF things ever get that crazy. 
The happy hour is awesome. 
And you can never go wrong with a Gilroy pizza. 
Literally the best. 
I'm not much of a drinker, but the pt's boulder stout is great. 
Angry orchard or any other cider is my bar go-to. 
If not, I'm a vodka drinker. I don't see much Ciroc, but there's plenty of other options, just in case. 
Big fan. 
Will frequent."}
{"text":"Clean, modern, not too loud, not to quiet place with friendly staff.

 My several visits so far this year have always been around mid-afternoon to mid-evening on weekdays or a Sunday -- I don't know how busy/loud/rowdy the place may get later at night, especially on a Friday or Saturday.

 The location isn't in the greatest part of town, but it's also far from the worst areas.   The parking lot is kinda dark at night, and I've seen a homeless guy loitering at their fence-enclosed Dumpster, like he was living there.

Nice TVs showing a variety of different channels -- I appreciate that they have Fox or CNN on some of the TVs, not just sports.    Plenty of seats around the central bar area, plus tables in a couple sections, and one section with couch-type seating.

 Food & drinks are pretty much standard PTs/lounge type stuff -- good quality, acceptable prices, but the Happy Hour specials are GREAT deals in my opinion.

  The only negative thing I have to offer is that most of the time we were there, there was just one waitress working.   Seems like part of the job of a PT's waitress is to be very friendly & somewhat chatty with the customers -- that's great!  Except if there's just one working & she doesn't see you come in & sit down because she was chatting with other customers, she may not notice you're there, sitting at a table for 5 or 10 minutes.    While that's not a horribly long wait, when you've been outside in the 115+ degree heat for a while & have been dreaming about that refreshing beer or Pear Cider at PT's, that wait is somewhat painful, especially if you know that she's not seen you sitting there yet.       Suggestion: for your first drink(s), get it at the bar, then sit down.

  I hope that at busier times, they have more waitresses on-hand.   I guess the problem with a 24/7 place is that for non prime-time hours they deliberately keep expenses down by minimizing staff."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service not so much. Lip stick all over my glass I asked for a new glass. We also came here to watch the hockey game the waitress promised the TV in front of our table would be changed to game and as u can see it's not. We asked 3 times politely. It still has not been changed. Very disappointed. We're taking our food to go and leaving. Will definitely not recommend anyone to come here. Spoke to waitress just now she said \"well we're busy so!!!\" Wow. Ok. Nice attitude."}
{"text":"Average atmosphere. Check. 
Average food. Check. 
Slightly under average service. Check. 

On a scale of 1-10 I rate this particular joint 
¯\_(?)_/¯ out of 10. 

If you're looking for good beer you can find literally anywhere else, this is the place for you. Bartender tries to make you feel like you've done something wrong because you've been waiting 20 minutes to grab her attention. That soul stealing dead stare isn't the most appealing to customers, especially when she decides to chat with her buddy for 10 minutes then get that beer you ordered afterwards. 

Bottom line, if youre looking for the most extremely slightly less than average bar with an unfriendly bartender, this PTs is the place for you."}
{"text":"The server/bartender Amanda was amazing. Had great talk and was very sweet! Also hilarious! I'll be coming back because of her."}
{"text":"First things first, I'm so happy there's a PT's up here  now.  I'm starting to feel like we're really a part of Vegas! 

Just went in there for the first time tonight.  Friendly staff, good atmosphere; really clean and brightly lit. Felt good to be in there.  Some PT's can be all dim and smokey and gross; but this one definitely wasn't. HUGE plus for me.  

That being said; it's PT's. It's a bar with some food.  I already read some reviews bashing the food selection (which probably attributes to the low rating this place has so far).  Look, it's a bar.  Sports and alcohol.  If you're expecting lobster it's your fault, not theirs.  PT's has burgers, fries, onion rings, pizzas, and more than likely the best wings in town!  Don't believe me?  Try the gold fever boneless wings and see if I'm lying.  

This place is great. I just got home from here 20 minutes ago and I'm debating going back right now for another order of wings..   but why are they $13?!"}
{"text":"Good spot for happy hour...good number of TVs so I can watch as many games as possible...burger's not bad either....pool tables are available...keep the Blue Moons pouring!"}
{"text":"If you want your own \"Cheers\", this is the place for you. Great staff all around.  Friendly, fun, knowledgeable  bartenders, fabulous cooks. You'll always feel welcomed here, and the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Wait staff was horrible! Maybe because she was by herself like,but she still never came back and ask how food was or if we needed anything to drink! Then waited for my check. I was expecting a great experience since I see these places all over town! Will not be heading back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Bartender was semi attentive considering it was dead. Played $60 - zero comp on drinks. Eh. Convenient location but why come here when Distill is down the road? Disappointed Bc so close"}
{"text":"So I've been to a lot of PT's here in Las Vegas and this location is probably the oddest location.  Horizon and Horizon is great that it's right off the freeway, however, kinda dark and creepy in my opinion.  We came here one night to hang out during the Holiday season.

Just like any PT's, the bar is and will always be the center focal point of this location.  This location didn't have as big of a bar as other location, but still big focal point. The lighting was not at elegant as I've seen and the smell of cigarettes was a little overpowering.  There's ample seating all around the bar and tables around the restaurant.  

I always enjoy their tall Coors Light drafts of beer.  It's about 5 dollars and for me, lasts a long time.  In that visit, I got the Club Wrap for about $10.  This wrap was filled with ham, turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise, all wrapped in a tortilla.  Yeah, A LOT OF STUFF!  You can choose from a few sides, I chose the coo coo chips.  Homemade chips with a smokey seasoning.  Everything was super flavorful and good.  The wrap was stuffed with a little too much mayonnaise but still good.  

If you're in the area, you should visit this PT's and see what you think.  If you're ever familiar with PT's, which if you're local, you probably are, then you definitely know that this is a usual PT's, but the location still creeps me out.  See for yourself though!"}
{"text":"This location is by far, one of the nicest PT's Pubs I've been to.  It's in an odd industrial, airport runway across the street-like, location, but I look at it as a gem in the middle of town :)  We came here tonight to celebrate the move of a dear friend.

When you walk in, you are reminded that the bar is and will always be the center focal point of this location.  The lighting is elegant and the smell of cigarettes isn't overpowering.  There's ample seating all around the bar and tables around the restaurant.  We took our party in a small nook in the middle of the restaurant, equipped with TVs and a fireplace.  Super cozy.  

I enjoy their tall drafts of beer.  It's about 5 dollars and for me, lasts a long time.  For the party, we were treated with wings, fries and a pizza.  The pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza and the wings and fries were covered in Parmesan cheese. The bone in wings were somewhat crispy, somewhat soft.  Garlic Parmesan offered a lot of flavor and so were the fries.  I loved the pizza soo much!  Imagine having buffalo wings but in the form of a pizza.  So much flavor.  Little bit of spice, little bit of tang, little bit of heaven.  

If you're in the area, you should take a little stroll and visit this PT's.  If you're ever familiar with PT's, which if you're local, you probably are, then you will love this location.  Although PT's is a chain bar restaurant, this location is one that will impress above the others.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This has by far got to be my favorite PT's! Excellent service great great great great View! Seriously you can watch the airplanes from the airport going in and out! Hahaha. Obviously a good time LOL"}
{"text":"I come here every Sunday to watch foot ball and have some beers. It's a awesome bar and you can't beat the help here. Ashley and Claudia are the best ! One of my favorite spots in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is a PT so it is what it is.  I like the bar food and sports setup, local feel and all that goes with it.

If you're the stuffy type this isn't the bar for you.  Honestly just save everyone the hassle and go elsewhere.

If you want to hang out with your neighbors and have a good time without expecting high end cuisine this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Me and my sister in law gave my mother in law a surprise party,  the food was good and the staff was friendly,  the only complaint I had was the DJ,  we paid him 100 dollars to play Hip Hop music and we paid him to come early, he only played a few songs on the list that we provided, then he would play a song off the list and only let half of the song play, we told him multiple times to let the while song play and he never did only when it was rock n roll HE SUCKS, I WOULD NEVER TELL ANYONE TO HIRE HIM IF THEIR HAVING A PARTY THERE, HES HORRIBLE A WASTE OF A 100 dollars..... I want my money back!"}
{"text":"2 stars for bartender  (T )  that cannot make drinks!??... if you have no idea how to make any mixed drinks you should not be a bartender!! when has a long Island only lemon syrup!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, waited 40 minutes for the bartender to tell me it should be right out pretty soon, I order boneless chicken wings. 
When I asked for my check I noticed she didn't comp my drink so I asked, after I paid, and she said oh yeah\""}
{"text":"Bartender was nice. But food is not even close to worth the money. Came in for a snack. Friend ordered French fries for me because I was on the phone and that's all I wanted. $7 for French fries. A normal portion. That's ridiculous. And they're not amazing fries that would be worth that. Not even Red Robin charges that much and their fries are bottomless. And the same quality. That's ridiculous. I won't be back. I don't expect to pay $13.14 for French fries and a couple of non-alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We went on a Saturday morning about 11:00. It wasn't busy at the time. We were the only people there and the girl that served us was very nice. We have a family member in a nearby hospital so we decided to try this location. I ordered the omelette. It has 4 eggs and includes 2 toppings. You can add toppings at an additional cost. Egg whites are considered an additional filling which is kind of weird but I thought was worth the extra charge. The omelette and hash browns were very good. The coffee comes in a big cup and was pretty tasty too. The only downside is that it took quite a long time to get our food which was surprising since we were the only ones in the place. I had to rate it a little lower because of the wait."}
{"text":"Love the wings n frys n the arrive is always awesome!!!! Convenient to home! Always open."}
{"text":"The pancakes were great and the day shift Bartender Cara is awesome. The place is new so not much of a crowd yet but when the outdoor patio is finished that looks very nice."}
{"text":"A+ for having good drinks, freshly prepared food late night and not feeling like a fight is gonna break out any second"}
{"text":"One of my newest favorite bars, I've been here 3 times and Anthony seems to never disappoint. The drinks are good and at a descent price and he makes the time to chat and get to know his guests. Great place and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here often about a year ago and it was awesome. We had a variety of food from the menu and it was always very good. I'm not sure what happened but we came here tonight and it was awful!! We ordered pizzas to go and they were horrible. They had very very little sauce, the cheese on the cheese pizza didn't even cover the pizza except in spots. The crust was burnt and chewy (go figure that combination) and the crust was about an inch and a half to two inches of the pizza. (In other words their 16\" pizza was like a 12 inch pizza stretched to meet the measurements). It was just horrible. 

For 50 bucks in pizza we could've and should've gone across the street to Sushi!"}
{"text":"randi was awesome!!! she took care of us from the time we walked in up to the time we left!! we had such an amazing time playing pool, enjoying really great music and great drinks and food!! i have alot of experience in the restaurant/hospitality industry and she has exceeded my expectations in every way possible!!! cant thank you enough randi!!! we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We are so glad to have a PT's in this location.  It's convenient and nice with great food and great customer service.  I got the spicy dry rub chicken wings and my wife got the Greek salad.  The food was great and they have a awesome beer selection.  We def will be back to hang here and gamble."}
{"text":"So glad to have a new bar to hang at up here in the southwest side of Vegas.  This area is built g up and getting more and more popular so it makes for a nice scene to see a new bar/restaurant pop up.  Although there are about 80 millions PT's in Vegas this one is unique.  

It offers great food and a great beer selection with great service.  Convenient location only about 5-10 minutes away from where I live."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, put $100 in the machine, played about an hour. When the day bartender came over after I tipped her and said since I wasn't playing max bet ($1.25), the new bartender's would not comp me top shelf. I usually play 2 credits mixed with 5 credit bets but I'm playing fast. Likely played $500 easy in that hour. Lost $100. Got a bill for over $21 for 2 small pour Grey Gooses on the rocks and my buddy's beer ($6.75 for Bud Light, lol). Management just doesn't get it, do they? Bartenders seem nice enough and are very pretty. But with all these peed off customers like me, they'll be getting bad tips and will leave for greener pastures. Place is physically nice, too bad some idiot doesn't know how to run a locals bar with gaming."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to PT's Gold. This place just recently opened in Green Valley in Henderson. We thought we would try it and see if it was much different from other Pt's establishments. Really not. Most have an eating area away from bar but this was all jelled together. We sat ourselves and the wait staff was with us in a short time. I ordered a beer and a burger Josie had Coke and a Burger. Neither burger was anything special or different than standard fare at other Pt's. Maybe I had better expectations. I am a player at Golden gaming and visit other bars quite often. Pretty average but I ma sure a great addition to the neighborhood lacking in a GOOD local bar. 
Thanks for visiting PT's Gold. I may come back again. there is another closer to home I tend to visit regularly. Sorry no Yelp review for that one. Its quaint and staff was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Kari was amazing! She was hot to boot too! Super energetic and made my visit comfortable.

PROS: Great energy, amazing customer service, great environment, good music, amazing food

CONS: WiFi!

Shoutout to Kari! You were amazing and very helpful!"}
{"text":"PT's used to be a great. It was an amazing place to come -- especially when the big game is on. Now, if you're a non-smoker you're an after-thought.  I came into this location. Sat on the non-smoking side and it took 15 mins for someone to even notice me. This is twice I've had this experience.  No refills and no chance to get an additional items. If you're using the gaming machines at the bar it's probably a great experience. If you want to come have a meal and not leave smelling like you just smoked a carton of cigarettes go elsewhere.   It's sad. PT's used to be a go-to spot for my family and friends. Now, it's just awful service. Probably why the dining room is completely empty and only the bar has people."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and great service! Awesome bartenders as well. Friendly environment"}
{"text":"Fries not fully cooked. Machines very tight. Horrible service, I had to flag someone down every time I wanted something even while they were asking others around me if they needed anything. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Was VERY disappointed with the service tonight. My wife and I eat at different PT's Pubs all over Las Vegas all the time. For bar food, they are pretty good and they make a good hefeweizen. It was Valentines Day and every normal sit-down restaurant was jam packed with people. We didn't need anything fancy but we were hungry so we went into PT's. It was a little busy but not like a weekend or if there was any major sports game on so we took a seat outside. Our waitress came over (I wish I would have gotten her name) and she didn't even smile. She looked like she was having a really bad night, and we were going to get the punishment for that. We placed a drink order...two beers and waters, while we looked over the menus. Water came out after a few minutes, followed by the beers. The beers had no lemon or oranges in them, very odd for a hefeweizen to be served. We decided to place our order. Pot Stickers as appetizers first. My wife wasn't super hungry so she just ordered chicken fingers and tater tots. I ordered the Ramen soup bowl. Off she went.

I kid you not, 15 minutes go by and we never once saw her again. She then walks out with our pot stickers. They were barely warm...obviously had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Overall, they were OK but not great, mostly due to them not being very hot. We didn't even have two bites of those and then our entrees came out. Obviously she didn't stagger the order so everything was coming out at once. I so absolutely hate it when servers screw this up. 

She drops off the food and before you can blink your eyes...she was gone. No salt and pepper on the table and no soy sauce for my dish. We had to walk up to the bar and get salt and pepper, which is good, because if we waited for our server to come back we never would have gotten them. She never once came to check on us ever. My soup was extremely bland with a really weird sweet taste to it. I ate half of it and that was it. My wife thought the chicken and tots were just meh...like we ordered it at Sonic. 

It wasn't until another 10-15 minutes until we saw our server again. I asked for the check...7 minutes go by and she comes back. As soon as she hands it to me she tried to run away so I called her back because I didn't want to be there another hour or two waiting for her. I gave her my CC and she was gone. 5 minutes go by and she walks by with some food for another table and tells me she'll be back, which she was in about another 5 minutes. 

The few times we saw her, she started to get a bit more polite but overall the experience was not a good one. For close to $60 for dinner (including the tip which I regret leaving), it was absolutely not worth it for some mediocre bar food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I have been to this PT's location a handful of times.  It is often quite busy.  Typical PT's.  Your Las Vegas neighborhood sports bar.  However I have a real hard time getting comfortable here.  The service is extremely average to below average.  The machines are extremely tight.  I've never been able to win anything here ever!  And I've probably been here 10 times or so.  The reason being is that it's near a friends house, so this is a place we frequent once in a while.  I do think I will be finding another bar to hang out when I am back in this area.

Ordered a burger and fries.  Burger was ok, and the fries were cold.  Like it had been sitting out.  

I think this place could do a heck of a lot better!"}
{"text":"PTs pub in Las Vegas in a good place to go if you want to play darts or play pool and have a really large bar with a lot of different beers on tap the bartenders are sometimes hit-or-miss depending on if they're talking to someone else so if they're busy if you had a good day but for the most part they're pretty good. The food is excellent at PT's but you want to get the right stuff so check out their website. I attached the link here

www.Pteglv.com"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is classy and fun. Lots of great beer choices, especially because they have PBR!! Food was great. We had wings and they were great, only thing is you can't pick if you want flats or drumsticks. Not a big deal. Bartenders were a bit less than friendly but maybe this was simply my first perspective. Only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it is a but expensive. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I came to this location for the 12am to 2am happy hour and there was only one person working the floor. She was working it and checked out ID's/ took our orders quick but she wasn't the nicest. Each time I came to this PT's I'd usually order a \"Brain Hemorrhage\" shot, one of the other servers suggested it to me since I told them I was into fruity drinks. When I ordered the BH with this one particular lady she said they don't have a drink like that so I told her would it be okay to tell her the few ingredients that was in it? But she just straight up said, \"I don't have time for that.\" Geez, okay... I mean let your other servers know to not suggest that drink if another server doesn't have \"time\" to make it. Also, other servers used to do this for my friends and I but this past visit our server said she can't split checks. Super inconvenient and inconsistent. Tried to sympathize with our server because she was the only one running the floor but there were other regular customers sitting next to us explaining to me that she has always been disrespectful each time they've come into PT's soooo this is a no-go for my friends and I from now on."}
{"text":"Ah PT's.  
Standard restaurant/bar that is super close to the house.
I hadn't been here for a few years, the last time I came out a friend was hosting karaoke.  I liked the place then, and I like it now.  

We came out on Saturday night about 8:30pm to play some pool and have some drinks with friends who had gotten married earlier in the day.  

First disappointment:  They don't have ginger beer for a Moscow Mule.  That's my new favorite drink, and I'm finding that less and less bars are doing those.  Its hard to find one that does, actually. 

Second disappointment:  We ordered the cheese fries (and added bacon) and the garlic parm fries.  WAY. TOO. MUCH. GARLIC.  Let me say it again...WAY too much garlic. And I love garlic.  Like...I'll eat it raw, I love garlic.  I put it in everything.  But there was so much that one of our friends had to move to another table.  We let our server know, and she was appalled, and said she'd let the chef know. 

Besides those two things...the night was pretty good.  
Drinks aren't cheap here, but they're not expensive either...fairly standard prices.  The fries were great (other than the excess garlic...the cheesy bacon ones were awesome) and they also have really good pizza.  A friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with hot sauce and blue cheese dressing...too spicy for me, but really delicious. 

Also, pool is $5 per hour, which really isn't a bad rate at all.  We played until almost 1 am.

It wasn't super busy, either, so service was fairly quick.

I'll come back again for sure...its not as smokey as the other bars we play pool in, even though people were smoking...its just much more open."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place! We stopped by to watch the early (10 AM) NFL games after having no luck finding a seat at GVR. We sat at the bar and played video poker and had a nice view of 3 games, with a view of 3 more games possible with neck craning involved. 

Bartender was friendly and helpful. Drink prices were decent (2.50 bud products.. my huge blue moon was $6 but was comped for playing video poker). The best part? The food! I was very impressed. This is just bar food people, so no it doesn't compare to a nice steak dinner.. but for bar food it rocked. $16.99 for a bucket of DELISH sliders (10 to a bucket.. with cheese, on yummy buns) or $16.99 for a bucket of wings. Best part about the wings? You can get them bone in, bone out, or chicken finger style. You can also get up to 3 sauces in your bucket (tons to choose from). The General Tso boneless was awesome.. kind of what Chinese food General Tso should be (white meat, yummy sauce.. no scary bites of \"what the hell is this\" meat). The Gold Rush sauce was also a pleasant surprise.. perfect mix of BBQ and Buffalo flavors.. yum!

3 of us attempted to split the slider bucket and wing bucket but we had tons left over. 4-6 pople could comfortably dine here on less than $35. Not bad! 

Trying to find a reason to fault this place, but can't think of anything.. honestly. Oh, and as a side note.. this appears to be a Steelers hangout on Sundays. It was awesome for us this particular week as we were betting on the Steelers and the Steelers won! However.. I'd stay away if you are betting on the other side."}
{"text":"Amazing location with a great atmosphere. They have happy hour every day from 5-7, midnight-2 and then half off breakfast from 6-10 daily. Something to fit everyone's lifestyle and right in the neighborhood. Welcoming friendly staff is just what we love about a neighborhood bar that sets itself apart from the rest."}
{"text":"I am NOT HAPPY with the service. The lady wasn't friendly. She took forever to bring us our drink. Didn't offer us silverware and just had didn't know how to make a proper drink. My friend ordered a simple. It took 30 minutes to get to her wrong."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here to enjoy some drinks and appetizers. Hilly, our waitress is very prompt and very friendly. Not too loud atmosphere with good music."}
{"text":"Been to a few PT's around Las Vegas and this is probably the worst one as far as customer service goes. I ordered a bucket of 30 wings and fries via phone. Told that it'll take about 20 minutes. Which was fine, no biggie. Totally understanding about being food taking time to prep and cook. After 20 minutes, I decided to head over there. When I got there, it literally took almost another 20 minutes for a bartender/waiter to notice me. It would totally be understandable, IF it was busy. But it wasnt. It was roughly about a dozen customers. When I told them that I was there for a pickup, the bartender notified me that the order I placed wasn't ready....

Really? For almost an hour after placing the order, my order isn't ready yet? Ok..... After another 15 minutes, my order were FINALLY finished.... but..... it was incorrect. It was for only for 11 wings and fries deal... so pretty much at this moment. Didn't really care... didn't want to take whatever how long to get my order fixed. Considering it took a hour to just get my order. PT'S is cool but this specific one is just eeeh... Last time I'll be to this specific one."}
{"text":"Wings are on point. Really great. But service however .... Waited for someone to check if we needed anything when we finally got the waitress we asked for a refill. Food has been fully consumed and still waited and waiting. As I write I have now been waiting over 20mins. Still no one has returned. Wow really. I should have gotten this to go.,, Plus the environment is nothing I'm impressed with. There's maybe 7 people and a group of 6 at the pool tables. And still nothing. What if I would have choked on a damn wing bone! ? Glad to say I didn't. Yet I'm still waiting.....now I just want to pay and get the hell out of here. It's been another 10 minutes , I'm still waiting. We finally went and got the refill ourselves and no acknowledgement what's so ever. Just oh are you ready for your bill. GET IT TO GO! Or spend your money at another place. I can't believe we still tipped her."}
{"text":"Great place to go to whether for happy hour drinks or food. Love ordering their tater tots and pizza while having drinks with friends.

Atmosphere is chill with different genres of music playing and TVs showing your various sports channels. Nice environment to be in rather than going out to the strip to drink or go clubbing.

The servers are cool and chill. There's one that always serves my friends and I. Never have bad experiences with her.  

They have 2 pool tables and have couches to lounge around and hang out with your friends. Definitely try their pizza! We always get the Gilroy pizza, which comes with sausage, pepperoni, and I believe a garlic pizza sauce. It's amazing."}
{"text":"\"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\"- Benjamin Franklin

haha. PT's at this location is one of our favorite places to chill. Get the beer by the pitcher and order the nachos with ground beef. While you wait for your food, go play some pool. After you drink, see how good you are now ; )"}
{"text":"This review is for the management team at the Arville location. Let me start by saying We love your beer and food. The service? Wellll, not so much. About 10 min after I arrived a server came to take my order. She brought it right away. And. Never. Came. Back. I had to flag her down to order an appetizer. 45 minutes later my 7 raviolis came (after I flagged her down to ask about them). My beer was empty for at least 25 min. I had to flag her down for a refill on that too (which I did when I asked about the ravioli). Took at least 15 minutes to get that. I asked for a menu about 4 times, never got one. If it had been just one time, we would've chalked it up to a fluke. But it's been a couple of times (with the same server) so here we are.(Randi was our server both times) As we were waiting on her, she would stop to talk with certain people and ignore the others."}
{"text":"I guess this a chain...but...I've never heard of it before. Came here on a whim with friends when in town and had a great time. Our server was a lot of fun. Most importantly, they had Glenfiddich 12. Delicious Scotch is a must when road-tripping."}
{"text":"Shout out to James, Alyssa, Christy, Melanie and Bree for always making me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Not the place you want to go unless you want to listen to ghetto rap crap. Even if you put several $ into touch tunes they will over ride you with ghetto crap. Otherwise - good staff."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing environment. Super friendly staff. Good food. Trifecta."}
{"text":"Nooooo bueno. This isn't my usual PT's location and this was my first time here. We came on a Friday around midnight (for happy hour). It was a coworkers going away get together so there was a about 10 or so of us there. For some reason there was just one bartender there that night. Not sure if they were understaffed or if that's how they usually run things.

I initially felt bad for the guy. Handling everyone's orders by himself was probably driving him nuts, so I made sure that I was thee NICEST customer to him. 

I can understand being frustrated with everyone trying to wave you down when you're doing a million other things, but rolling your eyes at people when they stack up their order cuz they don't wanna waste another 45 minutes during happy hour to wait for you to make your way back around our side of the bar again is really uncalled for. What else does he expect? I was only able to get 2 orders in the whole time I was there and only 1 of those orders was under happy hour prices. It was 2:06 by the time he got around to me again. I ordered 2 beers and 4 four horsemens. And he said \"Just to let you know, the shots are gonna be $12 a shot since it's not happy hour anymore.\" 

Um are you kidding me? What'd you want me to do 7 minutes ago? Go to the other side of the bar and scream at you just so I can get my order in before happy hour ends just for you to unkindly roll your eyes at me like you did to everyone else? Lose-lose situation I guess.

Bottom line--1 star based 100% on the service that night.

Sorry, not sorry PT's."}
{"text":"Relatively clean environment, but unfortunately the service isn't great.

Standard PT's menu and drinks, though not the best tasting PT's food in town. Service is noticeably subpar, unfortunately. Waitresses hang out around the bar and offer no attention to tables. In each of my 3 visits, I had to walk my drinks to the bar myself for refilling. Also walked to the bar to obtain and pay for my meal. 

Recommended to gamblers only. Otherwise, look elsewhere. Plenty of other PT's to choose from."}
{"text":"Great local bar & atmosphere. Steve the bartender always treats us great. Definitely worth the trip & they offer pool & darts. Great wings :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I love the decor and atmosphere. Food is great and the staff are really nice!"}
{"text":"Nice place with plenty of room for everyone. Bartender very attentive. Enjoyed happy hour with half off pizzas. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly staff!  Never had an issue with anything at this location.  Shout out to John OC Berish, he is a great graveyard bartender!"}
{"text":"This PT's is one of my favorites as far as layout and setup. They have a great outdoor seating area, ample parking, and the lounge area is fantastic. Plus the actual location is right off the 215 so it's pretty accessible.

Similar to my Sierra Gold review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-gold-las-vegas#hrid:MNv6crUqhAN95WRk6guK7A ) I am a big fan of their happy hour.
The Gilroy and Buffalo Pizza are my favorites but their monthly specials are pretty good too.

My only real gripe is that their turnaround time during lunch time is inconsistent. I once waited 45 minutes for a philly and the restaurant and bar were nearly empty. This isn't ideal when you're on your lunch hour from work... but once the work day is over --- i have no complaints for happy hour.  Half off pizza and drinks is a pretty sweet deal.

PT's is definitely one of those places you HAVE to go to at least once to be considered a local."}
{"text":"Very nice new-ish PTs off 215 and Durango. Large bar, plenty of table seating and very spacious. Wasn't too smoky or crowded on a weekend night after work. Service was very good and food was decent. A great addition for drinks and grub in the area. I'll definitely be back for some drinks after those rough days at work!"}
{"text":"Had lunch for the 2nd time there since it is close to work. Twice I called and pre-ordered the food. Both times the lady was nice on the phone and had everything ready just as we got there. The food is decent: not low quality but not high end either; to be expected at a bar. I was a bit bummed out that a few things I wanted on there menu they no longer served and was told they had to update their website. Although the atmosphere was good, the a/c was working great (as it's hot outside), and the food was decent, I still think the price is a bit much for what we had. The first time my friend and I had their salads. This last time we each had a sandwich. Overall the experience was good and staff attentive/courteous ~ just thought the price could be better especially during lunch hour or for someone they would want as regulars."}
{"text":"My wife had the chicken sandwich and onion rings and like it.  I had the Club wrap and fries.  The wrap was outstanding, felt that order of fries was skimpy.   Then I ask to order a side of fries and they don't sale side orders , if you want fries you have to order the $7 bucket that feeds four people.

They lost a star on the review because of the fries .    The server was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"They have one of the best pastrami sandwiches on rye pumpernickel swirl bread in all of Las Vegas!

Get there early and beat the crowd, we will be back"}
{"text":"Now there are PT Pubs all over town over the Vegas Valley!  One thing I can guarantee you that you will get it every single PTs, is the best lemon pepper chicken wings in the entire valley.  When you order your 12 lemon pepper chicken wings, make sure  you get a nice cold beer to go with them!

To go along with your chicken wings PT's has some of the best chili in town."}
{"text":"Jeff is the reason we come to this PT'S. Great guy, food is good and overall the other bartenders and servers are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest PT's fan. The food is mediocre and they are pretty stingy on the comps for gamblers. However, if you dig watching airplanes then this is the place to go! 

Last week we had incredible weather and wanting to make the most of it yet still get our drink on we headed down here to enjoy some unseasonably still rather warm weather. They have a rather small yet quaint patio that sits directly across the street from McCarran airport's landing strip. We enjoyed a couple of brews while my boyfriend geeked out playing with the different photo and video settings on his new iphone x.  Our server was great and gave us enough attention without making us feel like we needed to rush. Inside it is very spacious and they have a rather large viewing area in case the weather doesn't really permit inside."}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude service. Not only we were not acknowledged, attitude and personality were awful. If the bartender/waitress doesn't like people she needs to get out of the service industry. 

However, the weekend girl Heather is so sweet! 

Do not come during the week 5-??, you'll be disappointed and other yelpers agree."}
{"text":"I wish I can give a 0 star rating. 
I was playing poker machine n during playing game I went out side little bit and I came back n all my money was disappeared.  So I asked bartender what happened?  And he said they don't responsible for anything... 
What a nice answer... I guess I'll not go there anymore... and tell all my friends and Coworkers don't go there or be careful..."}
{"text":"May is the day or the two girls habe no customer service experience, but is the first bar that i see the bartender ignore and walk away...."}
{"text":"I live next door and frequent here a lot. Love the chicken wings but the other food is always served cold. Sent food back a few times."}
{"text":"If you want to have a couple of drinks with friends during happy hour DO NOT COME HERE this is the worst PTS in town. I like going to PTS but this one will definitely be the exception. Horrible service not only from the bartenders but the from the manager as well.  We waited a good 10 mins each time to get a drink. The bar wasn't packed therefore no excuse for the lack of service. The manager tried charging an excessive amount and when we asked to justify the receipt the manager said she didn't know how many drinks we had. This is probably the first PTS that doesn't like to serve you drinks during happy hour as if they have to pay from their pockets. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Mr Anderson rocks.

Food is pretty good for bar food. 

Unfortunately I never win on their games :("}
{"text":"Used to love it. 
I know Joe. 
I got ripped off and poor service tonight. 

I played $20 then did some writing at the bar. 
Bummer.

{"text":"This review is in no means meant to put down all of the staff. Amanda is the worst bartender I have ever seen in my life.  As a server she was terrible, as a bartender it's even worse. I give this establishment so much of my money and the service is horrible. Today I walked in with my wife and the bar was basically empty. I got multiple glances from the bar but no one would serve me.  The guy that bartends is very professional along with Terry and Tracy. I guess Amanda doesn't like money because she sure as heck won't serve her customers. We just left and she didn't even bother to try and stop us. This is the third time we have had to walk out like that. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place at least a couple times a month over the past year that its been open. great place to hang out and take a few friends. (there are party booths) Great customer service and food. would recommend for anyone looking to grab a quick drink and bite."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. It's not far from where I live. But I can't. The bartenders have breasts bigger than their brains. They cannot get an order right. If you are a woman alone do not try to go in here after work to have a drink and chill. You will be mercilessly harassed by some drunk pig of a man. I was totally uncomfortable here. I wish I could love this place but I cannot go back."}
{"text":"Place was empty when my wife and I came here for a Knight's game.  Ordered a beer and waited 15-20 minutes before we decided they forgot about us - they never brought us menus or our beers.  We ended up walking out to another bar nearby.  Come here if you want poor service."}
{"text":"The girl working tonight- worst bartender ever, and that's saying a lot in this town. Awful, slow, incompetent, lazy, unprofessional. I am still in awe if the terrible service, can't believe she's able to keep her job, even her fake hooters didn't help the misery we suffered waiting for this ridiculous skank."}
{"text":"This bar is an absolute joy. The bartenders are always checking on the customers and making sure they're enjoying everything. They don't just take your order and dart off, they take time to hold conversation with you AS they work. It's a great experience all around. The servers always seem so upbeat and happy to be here. Not to mention the food, everything I've had here is AMAZING!! I don't usually do bar food, but you wouldn't think it came from a bar. Everything is cooked to perfection. The staff as a whole seems close knit and knowing the people serving you get along well makes the environment so much more pleasant. I love coming here and definitely recommend it highly. Alana, Rian, Amanda, Chey, Tilly and Trevor (to name a few) always make me feel at home here."}

Dont come for breakfast this shit was pure nasty... 
BUT OT SERVER ANGELIQUE WAS THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"It's time to review the local pub. I consider this my PT's and I'm a fan. The bartenders and waitress's are nice. PT's is a great place to watch some sports on the TV while getting drinks and food. This PT's has 2 pool tables a seated area away from the bar and then the bar area with tables by the bar as well. They have happy hours and that's the best time to get their pizza and it's pretty good. They also have a jukebox which I like to use to sing along too. Sometimes my fellow patrons don't like my musical choices haha. Last night I had the craving for some food and thought about getting the almighty burger but opted for a healthier bikini wrap. It was stuffed with chicken and lettuce just the way I like it. I like the way they do their fries and I didn't even need ketchup.

Last night they even had karaoke which was a blast. Service was still good. I love when even though the bartender is busy they know how to keep on top of thing's. He would take orders and go in a counter clockwise motion checking up on everybody to see if they needed another drink or wanted some food.

I don't know if it's because this was one of my first bars that I love this place but it gets 4 stars from me for the good food and service."}

We walked in and the place was dark seamed friendly enough and has a large interior with pool tables, shuffle board and a few other things to enjoy. We hit the bar quickly to make sure we did not have a miss-hap like we did at stop #2 and oh boy was i surprised, i ordered a draft and out comes the mug of all mugs, Frozen with ice cold brew inside. Becky picked up a Mai Tai that was very strong and made right. We also took advantage of the 1/2 price pizza and ordered a small BBQ Chicken, which i must say was delicious. 

The staff was friendly and fast and recommended some great drinks. After hearing all the horror stories about this place, I have to say that the common misconceptions about this place have been debunked in my eyes. I will be back, Great Job PT"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Overpriced drinks. No pool tables. Worst pt's ever. Waiting 20 minutes for server to come by. Drinks were watered down with barely any alcohol."}
{"text":"Every year we hold our annual WordCamp Vegas after party at this location. We call in advanced and put down a simple deposit. The venue provides tickets for us to hand to our guests as they come in the door. Each ticket is worth a dollar amount. 

The staff is more than helpful and you couldn't ask for a better location."}
{"text":"I would say the service is terrible but in reality it is non-existent! We hadn't been in several weeks because of the poor service and even worse gamingI would say the service is terrible but in reality it is non-existent! Went in tonight and surprise...sat for 10 minutes and never were even offered a drink, a menu, nothing. This place will not be given another chance."}
{"text":"This is my go to neighborhood bar! All of the servers and bartenders really take care of you and some of us have become on a first name basis. 

Happy hour is always good and they don't skimp on drinks like most bars during happy hour. 

Never a long wait.

Always a good time."}
{"text":"I've come here a few more times because my husband has cravings for their pretzels.

I'm going to have to retract my review down to an \"a-ok\" rating because the food hasn't been as good as the first time.  Although my husband still loves the damn pretzels and would disagree with me on this review.

I would say one of the reasons to go here is the ice cold Hefeweizen beer, I still love how they give it to you in a mug that makes the beer so cold it is practically forming crystals.  The beer and pizza is half off during normal happy hour between 4-7 and late at night every day."}
{"text":"I love this PT's. It's huge and the food is always really good. The bartenders are all super friendly."}
{"text":"We all know that PT's is mainly a bar but this review is solely based on their food, specifically their breakfast happy hour selections. My family and I came here on a Sunday for their happy hour from 8am-10am for my 10 year old cousin's birthday breakfast (Sidenote: I know you may be thinking...kids at a bar?! But yeah they allow people under 21 for only a certain time period of the day. I was surprised too! Lol). Considering we were a party of 30+, I'd say the service was pretty great especially since the whole restaurant had only one server at the time; she was awesome and very patient with us! 

The food was not very impressive at all. I had ordered a veggie omelet and it was so dry and almost burnt and my cousins had ordered \"medium rare\" steak and eggs and theirs came out well done and super dry. Their pancakes were really tough to cut through and was almost inedible. A lot of the orders we got were mixed up or wrong but then again, can't blame them too much since we had such a huge party. Overall, their breakfast food was subpar but their service was exceptional for handling such a big party."}
{"text":"Best PT's in town! Chrissy and Caesar are the best service-wise. Great place to watch the Vegas Golden Knights game. Check this place out for a laid-back evening."}
{"text":"Is probably one of the WORST local bar chains that I've ever encountered in Las Vegas, Nevada. The customer service is absolutely terrible, the bartenders underpour the liquor, & keep you waiting for a good 15 minutes on a drink refill. Oh and about those free drinks while gambling, yeah forget about it. It's a $20 minimum while playing max bet to get one free drink per half hour, and it can not be top shelf ANYTHING. Oh and for the worst part, apparently you are NOT allowed to ask people for cigarettes in this bar otherwise they will kick you out! I don't know what kind of bar operates this way, but I sure do know the family that owns the chain and they're all a bunch of snooty stuck up rich brats. I take my business elsewhere. Might I suggest going to T-Bird Lounge right down the street on Eastern, or Mulligans Border on Pebble. Much better drinks, prices, and a way way less bitchy staff. They'll get to know you by name, and Mulligans has some great bar food. Don't waste your time here at PTs or any PTs for that matter. Oh and expect to pay $10 for a well drink with half a shot of liquor and the rest is mixer and ice."}
{"text":"I never know what to get at the typical bar food place, but the waitress recommended the pulled pork sliders...yumm...

my buddy had a burger which he said was outstanding, but maybe next time I am near there I will try it..."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here for breakfast because it is half off from 6am-10am. I ordered the Papa Frank's Biscuits and Gravy. It comes with seasoned potatoes toast and 3 eggs with 2 biscuits and gravy with sausage. Missi was our bartender and she was incredible, she greeted us as soon as we walked in the door told us about the specials. The food was really good, the eggs where perfect the biscuits and gravy was delicious and the seasoned potatoes where tasty. Thank you PT'S I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Opening bartender was on point with customer service. Helped with the game of KENO and the best options there are for a chance to win big! Drinks were \"comp\" because we were playing and the \"bar\" food we ordered came out accordingly and was ok. The place did NOT smell like smoke which was a huge plus!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a sports bar.  Tons of TV's.  Friendly sexy waitresses and bar food.
There are several PT's in the area and I haven't figured out why some are Taverns and some are Gold.  I do know that the pizza, sliders and wings were all above average compared to some bars.  I also know that you can see almost any sporting event.  They have promotions for football, fantasy football, fight nights, etc.  They have their own rewards card and the perfunctory poker machines.  I like that they have some non gambling sections of the bar and plenty of comfortable seating around.

I don't really have a complaint about this place, It just doesn't do anything to distinguish it from other sports bars.  Maybe it is the chain feel that makes it just a bit below perfect.  Still, you can't go wrong if you want a beer and a game."}
{"text":"Been here twice to play pool and have a drink or two. Never really had a problem. One of the bartenders kept conversing with a couple of the customers on the other side of the bar and I was standing waiting for her to stop talking and ya know, do her job but it's alright. Wasn't a big deal. Good amount of room in the place and a nice area to play billiards. Not the best PT's I've ever been to but I do recommend it if you're mainly going there to play pool."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time last night.  Our waitress was good Christine.  We loved the way it was decorated inside (the stone walls) We waited 1.5 hour for our food when our waitress brought our food she told us they were having kitchen problems.  I ordered the French dip the bread was good but I didn't care for the meat.  My husband ordered the club and didn't care for it.  Our fries tasted like they had been cooked about 10 times."}
{"text":"I actually just left there and couldn't wait to write a review.  I am so pissed off for the underhanded up charges.  Beer and bites my ass!

I have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.

I stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  

Now here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  

A basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? 

NOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why."}
{"text":"Our experience here was horrible. Liz gave us the worst service. She is not polite, she never asked us if we are doing ok, even when our beer was empty. She decided to go and acknowledge everyone around us but us. We are customers just like everyone else and we deserve good service. If I'm gambling and she feels I should pay for my beer that's just fine, there was absolutely no reason for her to be rude to us. I will not be coming back because the customer service here is lacking!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place was.  In Vegas you expect that pub food will be decent.  Places like Distill, Steiner's, and Boulevard Grille set the bar for pub grub.  This place is well below that bar.  

The grilled chicken sandwich had zero flavor with fries that were overloaded with salt.   The fish in the Fish n Chips was over-breaded and beyond salty.  I mean pucker your face salty.  The associated fries were too salty and not crisp. The chicken wings were the only bright spot.  They were crispy, hot and properly sauced.  Unfortunately, the fries accompanying the wings were too salty and not crisp.  

During our meal, the server/bartender ended shift and just left.  Not a word from the server or the replacement.  We were sitting there for 15 mins before we realized what happened.  We had to go get our own bill at the bar the new server on shift did not seem interested in much of anything. What a waste of 45 bucks and 90 minutes of our time.  

The only reason it isn't a one star rating is how squeaky clean the place was.  I know it is only a year old but they are keeping up the maintenance."}
{"text":"I'm not generally a huge fan of the PTs chain, but this particular location is a big exception. Manager/swing bartender Jen makes it into a fun Zander engaging neighborhood hangout.

Food is fine, not special, but decent bar food. Drink selection is solid, though not overwhelming. If you come here, it's for good treatment and good company."}
{"text":"Serena and Bobby you two are the BEST :-) :-) :-)  great service good and always drinks :-) :-)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and service .
Rebeka as always is the best .
They had the best X-mas party town."}
{"text":"I would give no stars but the sliders we received were excellent, but service wise, we were ignored for the majority of the night. This was the first time in 47 years (it's my birthday today) that I decided not to leave a tip. It took forever to place our food order and during the 3 hours we were there, our bartender barely acknowledged us and was more interested in gabbing with her friends about their upcoming wedding than waiting on other customers. We waited at least 45 minutes to get cashed out. We won't be returning. Good food, horrible service. Thanks for making my birthday evening unmemorable. It's a shame, I was excited when I saw this place being built. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"$13.50 for one order of chicken wings and fries, and then for a light beer add another $5.50 plus tip. You have got to be kidding me! I walked right out and cooked at home. Plus staff is on constant rotation so good luck building a rapport with any particular server. Not a good sign. Inflated pricing at the Horizon Ridge Parkway Henderson location. Beware!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday night/Thursday morning (6/22/11) with my friend Jerry J. after we got off of work. 

Play by play:
Step 1: Walked into bar.
Step 2: We asked bartender where we could sit. \"Sit anywhere.\"
Step 3: Jerry went to bathroom while I moved tables because the one we were at was covered in crumbs.
Step 4: Wait. Wait Wait Wait Wait.
Step 5: After a good 5-7 minutes, Jerry goes up to the bartender to ask for menus, a water and a beer... and brings them back to the table himself. The water has a funky chlorine taste.
Step 6: Chat, I look over menu.
Step 7: Waitress comes by to ask if we're ready to order.
Step 8: Waitress leaves when Jerry says he hasn't even looked at the menu yet. He said nothing was jumping out at him off of the menu.
Step 9: 10 minutes later, a different waitress takes our order. We split a \"basket\" of boneless chicken wings and fries, with a side of blue cheese and ranch dressing. We order them \"extra hot.\"
Step 10: Wait wait wait. Jerry tells me he'll pay me $50 to tell the really loud drunk at the bar to STFU. I pass on the offer.
Step 11: Waitress brings food.
Step 12: We eat the food - it's the first time that something has been so spicy, it makes my stomach feel like somebody punched me right where the umbilical and hypogastric regions meet on the human body in anatomical position. Although the food was so spicy it bruised my innards, it was tasty.
Step 13: We sit around forever. Waitress refills our cups, although we're clearly done with our meal. 
Step 14: Waitress leaves.
Step 15: After waiting around for 15 minutes, I go up to bartender and ask for the check and the box.
Step 16: Bartender gives box to waitress and she delivers it, with the check, 5 minutes after I got back to my seat.
Step 17: Jerry paid the $20 ticket (2 beers, tap water and a chicken basket) and we left.

Honestly, the customer service was non-existent. People shouldn't have to wait around and ask to get served. I understand that it's approaching 1 AM, but if you don't want to serve customers at tables, close the kitchen and only open the bar portion. There's no excuse to not acknowledge customers, let alone serve the customers when the place is dead. 

When Jerry and I got back to my house after the meal, my sister and her boyfriend were gone. When they got back, come to find out, they had went to eat at the same PT's we did (we must have just missed them) and they were complaining about the same type of non-service. My sister and I both agreed we all should have just left before we ordered."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a bar open so close to the house, however, I didn't feel that way when I left.
We were here for 15 minutes no one came and brought us a menu or asked if we wanted a drink. So my husband went to the bar to get us a drinks. While he was at the bar several waitresses came out with food and drinks for other tables, none of which said anything to me.
Finally, a waitress came by and asked if I needed a drink and I told her no my husband was already ordering our drinks at the bar. She then threw a menu on the table with one napkin and walked away. (Never to see her again I don't even know her name)
And in my mind I'm thinking NOOOOO okay well let me know if you would like to order food or need a refill....she just walked away.

We never received any service from any one however they did walk by looking but never asked if we wanted to place an order.


I spent $16 on one beer a Grey Goose/cranberry juice which was watered down I didn't even get a buzz.
Nevertheless we were only here for about 30 minutes.


I WILL NOT BE RETURNING CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Cool spot to go if you are looking to just hang out with some friends late night. They have late night Happy Hour Specials as well too.

The staff are all cool and I like how they have pool tables here and open seating throughout the place, so its not crowded.

If you got the late night munchies, you gotta try the GARLIC CHILI-CHEESE SEASONED CURLY FRIES!!! These were my hands down, must-haves anytime I am here! (Trust me)

Haven't tried the other foods yet, but I know I will when I come back

Recommended!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place has changed a lot over the last few years.  I remember when they first opened - everyone was friendly and helpful and compd drinks while gaming were a sure thing.  It's a nice enough bar, fairly small for a PT's, but there is still plenty of seating and a large bar.

I don't find the staff to be as friendly as they were - there seems to be a lot of turnover of the bartenders here.  The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a decent selection of draft beers (nothing out of the ordinary though).  Typical bar food, in my opinion.

There is nothing that really \"WOWS\" me about this place, other than the fact it is not far from my house and they are open 24 hours (although I have somehow been turned away more than once - who knows what was going on in the bar).  Sometimes there is also a shady crowd - I was in there one night when a HUGE fight broke out. One dude actually had a barstool and was about to hit another dude, but luckily there was a table full of off-duty Henderson police officers who got things settled pretty quickly.

One thing to note: it gets really smoky at times.  If you don't like eating while the person next to you chain smokes and blows it right in your face, I would suggest goig somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was going to a Super Bowl party and total procrastinated on making anything to take with me. I decided I should order some wings and called PT's that morning (assuming it was going to be crazy later).

Molly assisted me and was SO awesome. She took my order around 9am and scheduled it for me to pick up at 2pm. I showed up a little bit early and found her to be just as fantastic in person. She signed me up for a loyalty card and delayed my order so I could have a beer and throw some money in a machine. Once I was ready for my food, she let the kitchen know to prepare everything. The wings were tasty, as were the tots we ordered. The beer was cold, my machine was hot and overall it was a great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst place EVER!!! I accidentally hit max bet on 100$, the bartender was completely rude when I lost it all. Zero compt drinks on that, and someone so rude! I don't care if you have the best golden tee! Fuck this place!"}
{"text":"YO GRAPE KOOL AID!!! Great bar. Bartender was very attentive. Need more people like the peeps at this PTS."}
{"text":"Had the best pizza was bomb come see T she is amazing great with people n she makes sure everyone is happy not one sad face in this place beer flowing drinks great an she has not stop once bar is clean n the girls are hot so come down an see these girls"}
{"text":"It's a good little local chain bar. Would be better if it had more craft beers. When I'm in vegas I always stop here first, great people!"}
{"text":"PT's has good food and fast service . The restaurant is also very clean and modern. I ordered the prime rib and fries. The rib needed a bit more seasoning and the fries had too much seasoning. I also ordered their lunch turkey sandwich last time and that was very tasty with a great value. I will stop by PTs more often when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"This location is a newer pub near my neighborhood so decided to give it a try and see how the decor, smoke factor, food and of course beer was. 
Turns out its all great in the positive aspect. So the bar is very nice with TV screens all around the main bar and many on the sides of the outsides walls, so no matter where you sit, you have a TV view. 
Beer was on tap and pouring lively! Food was the standard PT's menu you will see at all the other PT's locations and Sierra Gold Locations. I was there at Happy Hour which is 50% off Pizza and Beer, great deal.

Smoke factor was very low and there was a decent amount of people inside the bar area. The decor is all fresh new chairs and couches and the small sitting areas are pretty nice if you have a small group. 

Bartenders and waitress were very nice and kept checking to see if we needed anything, which is a good thing when your dining. 

Parking is a small private lot. Some motorcycles parked up near the door. 
Noise level was average or standard for a bar establishment. 

Since this is a local and close location I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"This place was dark like a tavern should be, even when outside was so bright as the Nevada sun.  Our waitress was great, very friendly and welcoming.  The food was delicious. I had a bacon burger and it was cooked perfectly, and the fries were crisp and yummy.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Came in to check out the new neighborhood bar right by my house and was pleasantly surprised by the service I received. The bartender Ashley was prompt and super friendly! I appreciate her great conversation, and I will most definitely be back !!! Thanks again, keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I loved this place I went Thursday night it was the first day it opened very nice on the inside staff is really nice my hostess was beautiful food was great it's right around the corner from my house this is my new favorite place I recommend going definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time for a Real Estate networking group. I know big groups can be a bit tricky for establishments but they were great at handling the size of our crowd. The food is great considering its a bar. Very fast and friendly servers. I am definitely coming back another time for some beers. Great place to just chill and wind down. They also have a gaming area if your into that."}
{"text":"I usually don't frequent PT's but I really liked this one.  

Newer location, beautiful patio, plenty of tvs (one that was playing Food Network!!!).

I thought the service was really good.  Had a nice hometown feel to it.  No joke the bartender knew the order of like 90% of the people walking in.  And she was real good about refilling my friends drink super constantly too. 

I didn't experience a lot of smokiness.  There were quite a few people smoking but the air was clear and nice when I was in.

The food was alright.  Bar food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with some friends. My husband and them had been drinking all morning and I stopped by after work around 1pm.

As soon as I sat down I was promptly greeted by the bartender, I told her I wanted just a coke and a menu to look at. They have your normal bar foods with a few breakfast items. My friend got the nachos and I a grilled chicken sandwich. 

The nachos, $9, were tasty and it was a pretty big portion. I do think that the prices were a bit on the steep side. The 4 of us gobbled them down fast!! 

My chicken sandwich ($10) came with TWO huge chicken breasts, I ended up giving one away to a friend, it was so juicy and tender! My only problem I had was that when I ordered extra pickles they never told me that they would charge me, .75 for extra pickles I think it's pretty crazy they would charge for something like that but the fact they didn't tell me it would be extra bothered me. 

Over all the food was good and service was great so I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sized bar. A couple of pool tables, a large restaurant seating area, some video games, and of course gambling at the bar. I've been here a couple of times for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is 1/2 off before 10am and the chicken fried steak is decent. I had a Hawaiian burger this last time and it was well prepared, and came with a choice of cole slaw or fries. I went with the cole slaw and it was pretty good, heavy with the mayo flavor which I like.

Bartenders have been very nice and service is good. Place has never been very crowded while I was there, so I don't know how it is in the evening or nights. I believe they do have a happy hour with reduced prices and drink specials."}
{"text":"After reading most of these reviews, its pretty obvious something changed between a previous visit and this one. Before, my friend and I came in and gambled and had drinks, all comped just like a normal gaming bar. This time I stopped in for breakfast, put $20 in and ordered eggs, cheddar biscuits and gravy ($11) and an iced tea ($2.75). Drink wasn't comped. Food was just ok, same as a previous poster not fancy cheddar biscuits but doughy biscuits with cheddar cheese on top. Sausage gravy was lacking as well...not much flavor.

I won't come back again. One of my friends went to PT's on Decatur/Sahara and said after gambling she didn't get comps either. That theme seems to be reoccuring at PT's everywhere....so I guess its time to boycott the corporations who don't treat customers well."}
{"text":"This is actually a pretty cool little bar. Plenty of gaming at the big square bar, pool tables and games in one area, and some comfy lounge type seating in another with a nice view of the airport and the Strip. Fairly large dining area as well, maybe 20 tables. 

It wasn't busy when I went in on a Saturday evening to watch the Oregon Ducks vs Kansas basketball game. For some reason its listed as a Ducks bar, but it is not. Per the manager/bartender, they don't even get the Pac-12 sports package. 

I only sampled the rib tips appetizer and it was decent. Cocktails were good, and strong. Unlike other PT's, I had one drink comped for my $20 in play. Happy hour prices from 4-7pm I believe.

Not a bad place at all....I will return since its a good luck place for my Ducks! 0"}
{"text":"Clean friendly environment. Good drinks, better people! The bartenders are great!! Only thing I didn't like was the bartender was serving me Scooby Snacks as a drink instead of a shot, when I asked him what the drink was he said \"I don't know\" luckily my friend started talking to a girl there who ended up being a bartender somewhere else and she told me what it was, I immediately stop drinking it knowing it was a shot drink, not a cocktail, was definitely not feeling good the next morning from all the sugar. But I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am completely upset with my experience here tonight after being a regular customer here with my friends on many occasions that I had to write a review as I'm here. 

Walked into PTS and headed towards the table with my group. It took 20 minutes for them to take our order for drinks. Amanda came to greet us and took our order. Then we waited another 10 minutes even when it wasn't busy for our drinks. We then noticed that the server forgot one of our drinks 30 mins later and we asked her where our drinks were. She then told us she forgot about it because she was fighting with the bartender? Really unprofessional thing to say. 

Waiting for our drinks wasn't the only thing our group and I were upset about. She didn't even apologize and she spills a drink on me and didn't even say sorry and continued to talk to us about how \"gangster\" she was. Like really? Are you going to even apologize or offer a napkin? 

THEN she charges us for gratuity on top of our bill when we've been here numerous times?! Are you going to assume that we are all on one bill? Why charge gratuity when the service wasn't even there? 

I'm never going to come back here again and will probably talk to upper management regarding this issue. I do not think it's fair to be charged for something when it wasn't given to us."}
{"text":"Food was cold. We were only ones waiting and it took 35 minutes....... And it was cold I said that already but damn"}
{"text":"Went to PT's tonight with a fellow mom and we both played $20 each gambling. Ordered long islands that tasted like juice. I was a server for years so due to not wanting to be a jerk I didn't say anything. The people next to us ordered the same and had the same complaint. I said something to the bartender Cesar and he straight up told me he didn't want to argue and would comp it. After asking questions he cussed at both my friend and I and told us we were f***ing b***es and that we can get out of his bar. He Compt our drinks but after being yelled at and being told how horrible we were (just because we wanted a few drinks and gamble for a min) apparently he doesn't know how customer service works. I told him I was a server for years and didn't say anything because I know how it feels, he said I was a bitch for complaining. We didn't say anything until the customers next to us had the same problem. My husband came to pick us up (because we are responsible and don't drink and drive ) when my husband went in, Cesar hid in the back and wouldn't come out. I love PTs I spent $20 in gambling and so did my friend ($40 total) he called us \"f***ing B***ches* told us to get out of HIS bar because we complained about the drinks which I didn't even want to because I know what it's like working in a bar. We meant no harm but I can honestly say I will never go back to any PTs establishments again. I have never been treated so poorly like that. Cesar needs a new job. My husband came to pick us up (we each had 1 drink, spent $40 on slots) and Cesar hid in the back. Wasn't even man enough to talk to my husband after he called my friend and I \"f***ing b***es* and told us to get the f**k out of his bar. I will spread the word. 2 moms just trying to get a night out can't even get to enjoy an hour to ourselves. Another couple left with us that we didn't even know after having the same crappy service. So disappointed. Caesar said he doesn't need our money, we hate to tell you Cesar I won't give it to you. We work hard for what we have and being a server myself I have sympathy but just not for him. He might need a different job since he can't handle working in customer service. I'm so offended, I've never been treated so poorly anywhere. Being a server at a bar and restaurant for more than 7 years I could never imagine cussing and calling customers names like he did. It's a shame. Never again. Stay far far away from this establishment."}
{"text":"Your experience here apparently is dependent upon your bartender. We had a good one who kept checking in on more drinks and was on top of his game. Then comes the bartender on the graveyard shift from midnight. 

I asked for nachos. No meat, just plain nachos, which on the menu said they were $8.99. Later on, he brings the check, charging me $11.99 for \"beef nachos.\" I told this guy, \"I didn't order beef nachos I got nachos.\" He then proceeded to tell me that this price was the regular nachos. As I was about to explain to him, he walks away, crumpling the check in his hands, so I thought he was going to the cash register to get us a new check with the accurate price. 

No...this guy was by far the most passive aggressive person I have ever dealt with. He kept walking around serving other people, doing other things, while I continued to stare at him, waiting for our corrected check. 15 minutes goes by. I'm thinking what the heck...does this guy just want us to leave over his own mistake? I wanted to ask him for the menu to prove to him that he had overcharged us, but he was avoiding us completely. I wasn't trying to get free nachos. I was perfectly fine paying for what I had ordered but merely wanted him to correct his mistake of charging me for beef nachos (which is an extra $3 charge) instead of regular nachos.  It ain't about the $3 folks, it's a matter of principle. Finally my friend flags him down and asks him to get the check. He comes back with a check for nachos charging the same $11.99. This guy just didn't get it!!!!!! 

Since he was clearly adamant about avoiding any conversation with me, we just gave up and paid for the extra charges he billed us. 

Never going back here again. Geez, I don't know what was with his attitude when he was in the wrong. Some people told me I should have just left after he crumpled my check and threw it away. I don't know who does that? 

Totally ruined my night."}
{"text":"Meh. Ended up here a lot while family was at st rose. Location and cold beer is the only thing it's got going. Burgers are ok nothing more and the place has the lovely aroma of stale beer. Staff is friendly enough if there not in an hour long conversation with the regulars, I get it they are your money buy some type of acknowledgement that you will be with us in a minute will suffice.
Like I said. You walk across the parking lot and end up here. Otherwise drive down to tbirds."}
{"text":"Got there with a friend at 6:00p, left a 11:30p and played .25 video poker with 5 in the whole time (except when my friend ate a hamburger), upon leaving I was charged $13.50 for 3 beers. When asked why my beer wasn't comped, she said I only put in $40 and didn't play the max of 10, so the policy is 2 beers per $20. I won, so why would I put more money in?
I go to the PT'S by my mechanic on Silverado Ranch and they have max bet on video poker at 5, so I always play 5. This place is 10 and I am not comfortable playing 10 and why and when they changed that is beyond me. I didn't put more than $40 because I won twice so therfore I didn't need to put more in. So what I get off their \"policy\" is beer at that PT'S location is $20 a beer! If you win big and continue to play, all the drinks are now on you.. (although all 3 of us lost)
When my friend ordered a cheeseburger that claimed to be big, looked like a McDonald burger and tasted horrible, ditto for the fries and onion rings.
Service: Bartender was nice, but too busy with paperwork to be attentive to the customers, we asked 3 times for more drinks.  Atmosphere: Very heavy smoke smell and seemed like everyone who did smoke in that bar was a chain smoker.  I will stick to bar that is not so corporate and caters to their patrons more than their policy."}
{"text":"Service is great and very welcoming. Came here yesterday to see the Steelers, Go STEELERS!, pre season football game. Place is spacious and nice with an area of pool tables, games and big screen tvs everywhere. Literally, I was here for only 10 mins, since the steelers games was not showing, I was asked by 3 bartenders at 3 different times if I needed anything to drink or eat. Love that the bartenders are attentive and cool. Can't wait to come back for more than 10 mins on my next visit to try the food."}
{"text":"My BF and I are here at least four times a month. Was our favorite hangout spots until Super Bowl day.  Out of all the invites we turned down just to experience the worst time I ever had here.  BF ordered a double shot of some sort of drink, it was a single, the waitress agreed, took it back and the bartender simply poured the single shot drink in a different shaped glass and said it was a double.  We both ordered chicken nachos $16.00ea., we usually share, but not this time  (I love the chili that come on the nachos) as we are getting our cold chicken and four chili beans with no chili sauce the waitress says, \"I didn't know we were serving a nacho buffet for $10.00 today, I'm sorry I'm from another location, this is not my regular workplace\".  That's when I knew why there wasn't any chili on our nachos, it was all used for the buffet nachos!  This was the worst customer service and nachos I ever experience here. We finally left and watched the game at home, too many disappointments. May be best to brief your guest-workers, for better customer service...very disappointed"}
{"text":"Would have given negative stars if I could!!! We showed up with a group of about 16 people for my sisters birthday and the bartender and server treated us HORRIBLY!!! like we were a nuisance because we were ordering drinks and taking up space! You would think they would appreciate the business and the good tips we leave cus most of our group work in customer service! If you have a group of people take your business somewhere else who would appreciate the business!!!!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I  went in to PT's for happy hour to get a bite to eat and have a few drinks. It took about ten minutes to get acknowledged and when we finally did we asked our waitress  for the happy hour menu. She quickly handed us a menu and left. Ten minutes later (we are trying to get her attention she was gone so long), we asked her what appetizers were $5.00 and what drinks are 50% off. She tells us there are only two $5.00 appetizers so we order one of each. We ask about drinks, I ask if there are any wines on special, she says yes so I order a glass of wine. My husband asks about the beers, she quickly points to a couple brand names on the menu than says let me grab you a beer menu. So we assumed since we had asked her multiple times about the happy hour specials, the menu of beers she gave us was happy hour beers. My husband orders a 16 ounce angry orchard,  we also ordered a pizza which was half off. The two appetizers came out first, they were ok ( chicken fried fries and shrimp ). The pizza came next than the beer.  After about fifteen minutes she comes back to tell me my wine would come soon, they didn't have any clean glasses but they are washing them now. Eventually my wine showed up. At 5  minutes to 7pm the waitress shows up and asks if we want another wine/beer because happy hour is ending, we say yes. Ten minutes later the waitress comes back with the beer but again says they have no wine glasses, can she pour straight from the bottle into my wine glass (which I had barely drank any of), I told her yes that's fine. So fast forward to the bill. We get the bill and she charged us $7.99 for the fried shrimp (was one of the two items on the $5.00 menu), she charged us $6.00 for one angry orchard and $5.50 for the other. So again we have to  try and flag her down to ask about the charges, she says sorry  about the shrimp and tells us that we ordered the second beer after happy hour ended but she also told us the angry orchard wasn't on the happy hour menu............  Umm, she had come to us letting us know happy hour was ending and we ordered both a wine and a beer (somehow the wine still made the cut off the 50% off), se told us she could show us the time she had entered it into the computer........  Really??  So ok, whatever, lesson learned. But the final straw was when she charged our credit card but never reduced the price of the shrimp appetizer after I had brought it to her attention.   All in all terrible service, the waitress seemed genuinely put out by us. This was the worst service I have received in a very long time, she was not friendly or helpful, she seemed to be in a big hurry and didn't care if we ever got served.  We will not be back to this PT's nor will we recommend it to family or friends and we will be sharing our experience with them. Hopefully this will help someone else from a similar unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Been there Few times service sucks 50%on select shit well & domestic beers 
Coors light $3.50
Stella  .......$11.50....WTF
and with out a warming ....
I always gamble then free for me a couple times they try to charge after a had a few meaby the want to keep it....stupid little charge for half n half pizza 
Last night the bar keep could be a bit more attentive and equal with all customers and not with the ones he choose...sad but a reality 
 Maybe because hes a new guy in the location


Ps  The big white guy with the bald head and a bear he is always cool !!!
I guess I have to wait for him."}
{"text":"Rude bartender took him literally 8 minutes to come Id us and one of us was gambling. I look like I could still be 18. He was rude and quick remarks. Rob needs a refresher course on customer service. When he grabbed my ID he snapped it away from me and then added his two cents and then gave it back."}
{"text":"Service at the bar is great, greeted with a smile. The pizza was cooked properly. Last time must have been fluke which is good."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here with a group, very rude waitress. 1st time they had the nerve to bend my ID to check if it was fake because apparently I looked too young. They broke it in half. They didn't offer to replace it or make it up to us or even apologize! Whoever the manager was at the time was very nasty and didn't handle the situation well."}
{"text":"Heather was our server, she was amazing such an amazing experience! She was so fast and just wonderful! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews but for a bran new place and the place being empty the service was horrible. 5 customers in the bar and yet our server was to busy chatting with bartenders to attend to our drinks. Our main food got to our table before the happy hour apps which didn't make sense. All in all I'll stick with timber across the street."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:45 pm on a Sat. 
2 other tables beside the one for the two of us. 11 people at the bar. Ordered nachos, I had the small Hamburg, he had the boneless wing bucket. We got to enjoy watching the waitress and the bartender take turns eating off a plate on a table behind us. Not to say the service was slow, but the nachos took over 30 minutes. We are just getting our bill after 2 hours and 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, extremely patient especially with rude guests that are upset for reasons out of their control.  Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"Service is not great, which is typical at PTs. The staff seems to only talk to people they know. I wasn't offered a drink while playing, and there were only a few customers. I recently joined PTs text club and was there as a result of that. They send out some great offers and I hope they keep doing it!
Boneless wings are very good."}
{"text":"Pleasant during the afternoon. This out-of-the way location in the depths of Anthem provides standard PTs decor and the always present bar top gaming. The bartender was friendly and greeted me right away, which I've found to be consistent at most PTs/PT's Gold/Sierra Gold locations."}
{"text":"May be my favorite PTs location (this is PTs Gold) yet. I'm slowly making my way to many of the various Golden Gaming taverns throughout the valley. 
They do have it all here- patio, separate dining room, bar, lots of seating areas. 
Great happy hour drink prices, we had a 23 oz. Sam Adams for $3.25. Also had a pizza, which was half off too- $9 for a super large pizza. The pizza used to be pretty amazing at PTs Gold and Sierra Gold.  Now it's just OK. I like the newness of this location, though it's kind of off the beaten path. Maybe that is part of PTs plan to have a tavern on every corner!"}
{"text":"Mark is amazing and Jonathan makes the bet buttery nipples! Happy hour 12-2 is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was so delicious!  Best egg white omelette and pancake I've had in a very long time!  Service was friendly and quick too."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best PTS I've been to. The service and bar hosts are by far the best around. Tera, Sarah and Ashley are amazing, and no matter what shift I come on, my expectations are always surpassed."}
{"text":"Both Shannons, Carlos and Whitney are even better than the half priced happy hour pizzas.  The pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! The bartenders are friendly!  Loved the pretzel bites!"}
{"text":"Nikki  is THE BEST!! Go see her! She anticipates what you want! She's my favorite! :o)"}
{"text":"This is a really cute and sophisticated PTs! They have lounging couches and chairs, very comfy! They have two pool tables, $5 an hour--not too bad. We ordered one of the pizzas because it was half off during happy hour, and the crust was thin and it was super yummy! Happy hour is awesome! We ordered a bunch of drinks for half off. It was a fun time with my friends, I would definitely see this place a hangout spot for us in the future. Good food, good vibes, awesome prices. Woo!"}
{"text":"This review is for our bartender, I believe his name is Jordan? Or something with a J. I caught it but don't remember exactly. I'm so bad with names. But he's super awesome and took care of us last night. Every drink made was to the rim. He wasn't shy at all.  He's usually there Mon-Wed graves so you'll definitely see him during Happy Hour. 

I like this location. It's really big and has many tvs and three pool tables. Lots of room to roam around and even has a little lounge area with couches. 

I like to get happy hour because it's 50% off pizza, drinks, and select appetizers. You really can't beat that deal!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for their happy hour. It's a clean pts near the airport runway so it's pretty cool to see planes fly off to the distance. I know the bar can get pretty busy but the bartender did good on keeping up with everyone and their drinks. The pizza is always on point I'd recommend the gilroy with marinara dressing on the side. 50% off pizza, select drinks and appetizers. 5-7pm and 12-2am every day. You can't go wrong with that one!"}
{"text":"Of all the places I've been This Pt's has given me one of the best experiences for the type of place. I don't expect to be waited on here as I would at a Morton's Steakhouse but They never let my drink run out before asking me if I'd like another. They are friendly, attentive, and I don't feel like I'm just a bother to them. It's a nice relaxed atmosphere great for hanging out with friends. Wish there were more places like this in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this PTs. the bartenders (Geb I think?) are awesome. The atmosphere is perfect. The happy hour is unbeatable with many beers on tap. 

Big fan of this PTs."}
{"text":"I'm just really sick of poor customer service. Customer service, that, when you first visit, seems great! But then you keep coming back and you realize it's just a big facade. I've come to very much dislike this place. Over the course of 1 month, we've slowly been treated less and less like anything valuable. Never get anything comped although we play a bunch. Every single thing we ask for seems like the biggest inconvenience. Just disappointed, and will not be returning. Boo."}
{"text":"Service is a must in Vegas ..... Being a server myself I know how it is to be busy but honey it's 10:30 am 2 customers and 3 waitress and no one can ever give you the time of the day not only did 2 of them look at me then go back to talking to each other that's a NO NO...... Your lucky I still left you a 3.00 tip for just a take out order that's more then people leave on dining in and she still didn't get my order right not a recommend place ......"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome came in the first night met Curtis who is awesome then followed by Mandi later on that day who was overwhelming accommodating. tweed on grave is your local vegas grown allstar graveyard bartender.."}
{"text":"Went when first opened morning bartender didn't even take or order the guy taking out the trash did both the bartenders that where their where more into talking about their hair and not taking care of guest which sucks for the closest bar to my house . Their was nothing to do their besides gamble and drink pts I'm used to them having pool tables and being a good place to go regardless if you just want to play pool and drink the art work on their is shameful I want to see women their not pictures of scandaless dressed women on the walls"}
{"text":"Good food! We had the club sandwich $10 & adult grilled cheese $9. Great drinks! Highly recommend the Mango Maggie!!! Fun atmosphere. Our waitress Christina was great!"}
{"text":"PT's is awesome specially with Ashley, Claudia and Jennifer as my bartenders and servers great service I recommend it to anyone and specially for these beautiful girls for giving the great service I get from them!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing PT's everywhere so I decided to try it last night, and since it was happy hour (5-7) it was half priced drinks. Well we didn't realize that and rolled in around 6:50pm and the super sweet and cute waitress, Jenna ran over to our table from behind the bar to get our orders in before 7. She earned her a good tip just by doing that. The food was good and the drinks were cheap. Jenna was super busy holding the whole dining area down but she pulled it off and was one of the nicest waitresses I've ever had, seriously! I recommend it just for the positivity in that place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with a variety of beers on tap. Not fond of their food so that's why all I do is drink there! Mikey on grave is the best bartender. The main reason we keep going back there is him!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them one star but I am forced to. I just walked into the bar and sat down, ten minutes and not one bartender came up. There was nobody behind the bar and the phones were constantly ringing. I left, took my business elsewhere and am not sitting at the lovely Brentwood. Peace out Pt's."}
{"text":"My buddies and I went here around 3 am. Had some late night cravings. Ive been to a couple pts and this pts has the best hospitality, best food quality and best atmosphere. We got the sliders, nachos and south western blt. Really good stuff for late night.

Cindy and Jeff are awesome!!!! Big props to you guys. My buddies n I are in the hospitality industry and it means alot when you go somehwere late especially a bar and its good service! Keep it up! You will see us more often"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place one star is because the gaming really sucks. The staff is awesome... The food was mediocre.. but as I said the staff was awesome. I sunk nearly $2,000 into two different games and barely had one winning combination. The bartender was nice enough to let me know that somebody else had spent over $2,000 in another game on Keno... So I went to that game and I spent nearly $1,000 on that game. I am not a degenerate gambler. I do have a lot of disposable income, and I have played enough to understand how the games play when they are set at a reasonable percentage payout. This place is trying to pay for it's new construction and opening by setting their games to the absolute lowest payout. If you want some good Association, that is from the staff and not the other patrons, (half of them seemed as though they were human traffickers)... Lol, then this would be a good place to go. If you are looking to go someplace where the gaming is on a fair level playing field, then definitely go someplace else. You will just sit there for hours and lose all your money."}
