{"text":"We have ordered pizza, sandwiches, and dinners for take out and delivery and always delicious. Last time we ordered the Chicago style pizza and loved it. The staff at the counter and delivery guys are always friendly. Our favorite sandwich is The Cheef, favorite dinner is Lasagna and favorite pizza is the Super Supreme."}
{"text":"I must say perfect... I travel for work and it was great to check into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes. The food was much more than I anticipated...  A MUST try. Very well seasoned and the service was great from the phone call to the delivery... 5 stars all around!  The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered a stuffed (Pie) pizza for carryout. When I got home and opened the lid on the box I knew immediately that this was not going to be a good experience. There was very little sauce on top of the pizza to the point where I could see the cheese/dough on about half of the pizza. While having a slice I found out that it was not even cooked completely. I lifted up the layer of cheese and the crust's top third of the dough was not done and had the raw playdough feel with a darker tint to it. I had to call the store about this because I was not going to pay for this. I asked for the manager and he was going to make another one for us but I did not want to wait for another 45 minutes. I was thinking about getting a different type of pizza but the manager was kind of cold over the phone and wanted us to come in again to pick up another pizza. At that point they lost me and it only got worse. I wanted a refund so he instructed me to either come in that night or the next day with the pizza for the refund. So I took the pizza in and showed it to him and explained my dissatisfaction with it. He told me \"This is how this pizza is\". I know for a fact that this was not true. I used to work in pizza for many years when I was younger for a good amount of time as a kitchen manager/baker. I think I can tell if a pizza is raw or not. I did not want to argue with him in the store, for he has already wasted a good amount of our time and I knew he already had is mind set that we were wrong. He was even rude with his staff while we were there. Not until we were about to leave did he even apologize. Even then it was not sincere and was more a part of the refund transaction. If \"this is how their pizza is\" then there are many better options in Madison since this place is going in the wrong direction. If you want a good Chicago style or stuffed pizza pie I would suggest Pizza Extreme. Otherwise glass Nikel for your other types of pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches, and thin crust pizza. Dont care for their Chicago deep dish,stuffed,or pan style pizza,because it tastes like they use margerine in the crust instead of half margerine, half butter, which is the way I like the Chicago deep dish crust to be made. Try the Valentino, on thin crust,and it will spin your cap for sure,and they have a good italian beef sandwich,and sausage sandwich.Overall,its a bit pricey,but they do have some very good choices. They also charge 2.50 for a delivery fee!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up from here twice now.  It's more of a 3.5 star place.  Guy who took my phone order both times was super friendly (was the same guy in may 2014 and aug 2014).  Double checked that I was for sure trying to call the E side place on Commercial.  Smart.  The first time we were moving and were super starving and it was AMAZING (as former residents of Champaign, IL we had high expectations.... when it comes to college student 'za anyways) and I have no strong memories of either way. 
We only ordered pick up both times because we live soooooooooo close to this location....... way too close to justify a steep delivery fee.  If I had paid an extra 3 bucks for delivery for this, I'd probably be bitching more.  Their prices are a bit steep....
This last time a few days ago we ordered the spinach, garlic and tomato pizza.  My husband swore up and down the spinach came from a can.  I trust him about this and everything so I back him.  The garlic was super heavy and strong on some slices and absent on some pieces.  Spread it out more evenly!!!!  Otherwise delicious.  The thin crust and the cheese were delicious.  Even the next day for lunch.  Will order again.  Join their Pizza Eclub online and get an email for 15% off your next order!!!!
PS.    I never had anything from Rosatis other than pizza.....and I probably wouldn't recommend you do, either,  Pizza is where they are at."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area, but I'm here for a few days. I had a hankering for Italian food so I ordered from Rosati's. The food is excellent! I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and mozzarella sticks on the first day. Yum! Today I ordered the cheese lasagna and a personal pizza. Again yum! And the delivery drivers are awesome. I will definitely be ordering from this place again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"LOVE the chief sandwich! Their pies are really good too! Both locations are solid and we usually order as take out."}
{"text":"I ordered 48 Jumbo wings on New Year eve. I paid over 40.00 dollars for them and I threw them in the garbage because they was over cooked and dry. I called the store and told them. They informed me that someone would call be back and that been 5 days ago. I just can not figure out how these business treat there customers. I will never ever order from this place again"}
{"text":"I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often.  They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks.  Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip, as if the person buying the food is responsible for the shitty wage the store pays or the tacked on fee that apparently does not actually support delivery) but they are usually less."}
{"text":"Delicious!
 Large Lunch business  meeting order.
Delivered to hotel meeting room.
Hot and great quality ingredients.
Very fast considering we ordered 6 extra large pizzas and one large salad.
A couple opportunities:
A serving spoon was not included with the party salad. Envision trying to get lettuce out of the large pan with a standard fork.
The pepperoni wasn't marked and looked just like the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"In a word...\"meh\". 

Ordered a pizza from here on a Saturday evening - the online ordering process was easy and they have a tracker so you can estimate what time your food will arrive - for us, it ended up being about an hour wait.

We ordered the \"Valentino\" with regular pizza sauce rather than BBQ. It wasn't that hot when it got to us, and was super, super greasy. For $30, I expected more."}
{"text":"My go to in this area.  Thin crust is a winner.  Sauce excellent.  Call to pick up always right on time.  Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Before I moved away from Madison, I used to order the Italian beef from Rosati's on a regular basis. It was great. Italian bread with a crusty outside and soft interior, thinly sliced and flavorful roast beef in good proportion, and mozzarella cheese. I would also order the hot peppers (giardinara) and au jus on the side. 

However, I was recently in town and ordered an Italian beef and was sadly disappointed with the amount of meat on the sandwich. With all the ingredients, it barely filled the bread. That's not how it used to be. Although the flavor and quality of the sandwich was good, given the price of the sandwich and my expectations for what an Italian beef should be, this last experience was extremely disappointing. I just cannot justify giving the review anything more than two stars. I hope they will employ better quality control to assure customers that they will receive the sandwich they pay for."}
{"text":"That deep dish pizza... so deadly & delicious. They also make a lot of yummy appetizers and dinners. If they had online ordering back when I lived in Madison (maybe they do now?), I would have ordered from them more often."}
{"text":"Why one star? Well, we've been to the Rosati's location in Oconomowoc for years, excellent food and even better service. We were hoping for a similar experience in Madison, unfortunately, we didn't get it. This was our second time at this location and will be our last. 

We ordered our food online thinking it would be easier to make sure everything was correct. The order is below.

1) Cheese Ravioli with Tomato/basil and a side salad.

2) A 1/2lb cheeseburger with tomatoes, lettuce and ketchup.

3) 10 wings plain with Ranch dressing on the side.

A pretty simple order. We showed up to pickup our food, the receipt clearly stated all the items were included and in the bags. We also asked twice if everything was in the two bags before we drove away. We were assured that all of our items were in the bags.

Nope! The side salad and ranch dressing for the wings were both missing. But ketchup and mayo packets were in the bag which neither of us asked for. My girlfriend called the location immediately, it was a 10 minute drive home so we had just been inside the location. She was told they couldn't refund the side salad because of a server issue? They offered to deliver the side salad within the hour or give it to us on our next order? Our next order? That was our last order, ever, from this location.

You can't refund $1.85 because we ordered online? Or is it because of a server issue? Either way, avoid this location at all costs. On top of that the food pales in comparison to the Oconomowc location. 

Don't waste your time or money, there's much better options out there.

{"text":"Two stars may be a little bit low, but so many things were not quite right.  Ordered a family size portion of baked mostaccioli.  It cost over $30, delivered, with three dollars going to the delivery person. Why do food delivery businesses act like gasoline is still more than four dollars per gallon?  Frankly, it was nothing better than OK, and a person could probably have gotten it in the frozen food section at their local grocery store for about 1/3 that price, baked it at home themselves, and been just as pleased with what they ate.  The garlic bread that came with the food was at best, mediocre.  The small container of Parmesan cheese that came with it was crumbly, and probably came out of a cylindrical container and was ground who knows how long before I ate it.  But it was a small bonus, and had NOT been represented to me as parmigiano reggiano.  The person who answers the phone is really not qualified to be answering the telephone as customer service personnel. I had to repeat myself, and although I had told him my apartment number twice, when the delivery person arrived, he called me on my cell phone, rather than using the intercom, telling me he didn't know which apartment I was in. When the food arrived, my apartment number was written on the receipt, which was stapled to the outside of the bag the food was in."}
{"text":"The huge thin crust supreme pizza we had was delicious! If we lived here, we would be returning."}
{"text":"Love Rosatti Pizza. Delivery is reliable, and pizza always dependable good. Great thin crust. Crunchy and crispy in all the right places, and NOT floppy or doughy anywhere. My favorite specialty pizza is the Valentino (the sauce is a blend of their regular pizza sauce and bbq sauce, mmm...) topped with italian beef sausage, hot peppers (oh yeah!!) onions, and tomatoes. All those toppings are blanketed with melted cheese. Heavenly. They cut their pizza into squares, (if that matters to anyone reading this), and all the pizzas (from what I've experienced thus far) have the toppings underneath the cheese, vs. on the top of the cheese. We've only ever ordered a couple times, anything else from their menu, like pasta, salads, etc. Nothing too notable here, bad or good. Just average. The pizza is why we order from Rosatti's. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have a coupon for free 12 inch pizza when purchasing 18 inch pizza.    It doe NOT specify that it is only good at the Madison WI west location.  The east side Madison WI location refused to honor it.  The coupon just says \"Rosati's\" with their logo.   Boo shame on them."}
