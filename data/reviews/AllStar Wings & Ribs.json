{"text":"Came here for my birthday with a group of friends last night and left feeling dissatisfied.  Standard All Star food quality aside, I have to write this review because of the service I received.  I was extremely unimpressed when we wanted to place our orders but our server was more focused on flirting with my friend for 10 minutes first (and then later for the rest of the night)? Like is she at work or not? Later she brings the drinks and we find out she missed one of the cocktails.  Food is brought out later, minus my order and my friend's. Whatever, we chill for the next 15 minutes waiting. Still no wings. Concerned, we ask our server about the orders. She seems surprised and I'm thinking that she didn't even know she was missing two whole orders? She says that we'll be getting them soon, as she takes more of my friends' orders for round 2. Finally my food is brought out 30 min after everyone else but it felt like a waste because everyone else was finished their food and waiting on me. I let a manager know about the situation and he was very empathetic and friendly but honestly on my birthday, it felt ridiculous and I didn't want anything like this to happen at all. He ends up apologizing on her behalf, taking the auto-gratuity off and giving a discount. The server ended up not apologizing personally at all and avoided full eye contact with me for the rest of the night, trying to scavenge whatever tips from the rest of my friends. Girl just apologize! This whole situation could have been avoided but I ended off my night at All Star with still a very bitter taste and birthday memory."}
{"text":"So glad to finally see All Stars in Mississauga! No more late night treks back from Vaughan! 

Anywho! This was my first time to this location and I loved it! The set up is a little different inside the restaurant as opposed to the one in Vaughan; I didn't really mind it but I liked the booth set up more (mind you I only saw what was on my side of the restaurants lol). Also, if you're gonna be going with friends to watch a game, no one will complain of not being able to see the TV properly as you would hear at Boston Pizza or Wild Wings etc because there are literally TVs everywhere. I don't wanna exaggerate this....but there are TVs.....everywhere. Service was excellent. I kinda felt bad cause halfway through our visit, 3 waitresses got reduced to 1 and she ended up taking care of three big parties but she was awesome. 

When we got there we ordered an appetizer for everyone to share: the Greek Fries. Basically just fries with spices and ranch. Sounds pretty simple but it was delicious. 
They had a good selection of food but if you're gonna be heading to All Stars, you should be going for their wings. Be ready to choose from a selection of over 130 flavors, varying in their spicyness. 

The following wing flavors were ordered: This is Sparta!! (Weirdly enough, the first taste I each wing had a hint of watermelon....kinda weird but I didn't mind it; picture attached), Greek Texan (a personal favourite), Caeser Goes Texan (or something similar, this one was really good too but felt it was way too saucy and the ranch overpowered a bit), Pandora's Box (a variation of honey garlic, I didn't try this one but only heard good things), and finally, Desperado (I really liked this one and recommend it those who like it hotter than the rest!) 

All Stars is always a recommend. Wings galore!"}
{"text":"A lot of my friends talked about All Stars and their wings and how amazing the food was but I haven't been able to say the same until I tried it for the first time a few weeks back! And my God, were they all spot on. 

It was four of us and we shared some jalape√±o cheese poppers (or something along those lines) and they were super. I had a Shirley Temple, which is by the way the BEST one I've ever had!

Anyway, I don't really remember what everyone else got but I got the Greek Texan and YUM was my verdict!

I totally recommend this place for a good hang out :)"}
{"text":"Beat wing place in GTA. 

Must try flavour: Desperado 
Guarantee 100% satisfaction

Lots of TV's for sports, very clean, and good selection of beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Awesome greek fries and great wings if u can handle spicy food"}
{"text":"Went here with a group and it was first time so I didn't know what to expect. 

Service was okay. The girls were nice but new (they told us they'd only been there a month) and only knew parts of the menu. While I can understand being new and learning the ropes, I don't know if that is something you should be telling customers. Still, they were nice and brought jugs of water and such when we asked. 

I decided to play it safe and get the chicken and fries. It was pretty good, but the weird thing was the sauces. When I saw the selection, I decided to get the sweet & sour sauce. It tasted like salsa, I kid you not. I even had my friend try it and they thought it was weird too. I've had sweet & sour sauce at various places and it's never tasted like that before. Then again, they aren't known for that so I can understand. I asked for plum sauce as a replacement which they did no problem. Can't mess that up right? WRONG. There was something weird about the plum sauce too...it just didn't taste like plum sauce. Again I had my friend try it and got the same answer. 

Other than that, my meal was decent. I was tempted to get dessert but declined. Everyone seemed to enjoy that part of the meal though. 

One of my friends' burger was missing key ingredients but they were pretty nice about comping it and offering her another one. At least that part was okay. 

Honestly, I think I would go again. It wasn't the worst place and the prices were low. Plus, it was pretty clean for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Went out with two family and two comrades for wings Sunday night.  We arrived around 7pm and were seated promptly.  Too many college type girls in mini skirts collaborating over conversations unrelated to customer service ...... Gotta love that!
Anyways, onto the food. 
Appetizers ordered were:
Calamari - nothing special. Small rings deep fried.  Tzatziki sauce. 
Mozzarella sticks - such tiny portions  given, & they were so small in size.  Marinara dipping sauce. 
Onion rings- standard from frozen.....
Lastly the popcorn shrimp, not worth bragging about, but it was the best of the bunch. Dill dressing.
The wings:
Firstly, as another fellow yelper mentioned, please don't waste the patron's time... We are hungry, we want to eat , so don't recite to us with small cue cards ALL those wing flavors, put it in the menu for fudge sakes!!!.  And when the wings do arrive, let's have them hot, temperature wise shall we? Also why do they charge an extra $2 for splitting the wing order?...... Is it so difficult & cost worthy to shake up wings in  a sauce, really??. Considering we spent around $150!
Listing from best to blah:
Pandoras Box - similar to sweet chili Thai
Parmesan Caesar?- exact to flavor 
Aztec chocolate
Some other chocolate flavor- extra chocolate sauce splattered atop (unnecessary))
Voodoo- kinda spicy
Good sized wings anyways
Now for the worst part of the menu & quite important, considering there's a bar.
The BEER.
Not much of a draught selection here, but nonetheless, the real issue here was with the glass ware themselves. I thought it was just me but, nope, my BFF also noticed this, & to all fellow yelpers who drink at this place, pay close attention when you tip that beer glass to your lips...... Do you smell / taste the scent of \"bleach\"??...... NASTY!.  Come on staff, please cut down on the concentration of bleach, & double or triple rinse maybe??......What a way to ruin a nice cold one!"}
{"text":"This gets one star because our server was okay. The wings not so much. They seemed to be refried twice wings, small, and really dry and chewy. We chose Pineapple Mustard and Thai Magic as our flavours. The Pineapple Mustard had a curry powder aftertaste. Not a great surprise. Thai Magic was okay, very light on the Thai side. Both flavours seemed to be brushed on the wings and the wings did not have any seasoning to them at all. This was a really disappointing visit compared to a previous visit to another All Star Wings location that was really an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"We dropped in on a Sunday for a quick bite. It was my first visit to any All Star Wings location. There were quite a few families that evening. We had great service. Our server refilled our drinks without us having to ask for a refill. 

We ordered the Lemon Pepper wings and Orange Ginger wings. Both types had great flavor in the wings and not just in the toppings. The Lemon Pepper wings were really peppery. The Orange Ginger wings had a nice crisp bite yet still freshly fried and tender. We also ordered the Beefeater Onion Rings and we really enjoyed those. The Greek salad not so much. The lettuce was chopped too finely, kind of limp and had 2 olives. 

We will return to this location. I don't know why there were so many poor reviews. We tried the Vaughan location after enjoying wings at the Scarborough location, but were were really disappointed at the food quality there. 

Good luck!"}
{"text":"Another sports themed restaurant centered around wings. A perfect place for those who are there mostly for the sports.  The wings are average at best. The one plus is that they have Murphy's on tap which is a rarity.  If it's a choice between here and Buffalo Wild Wings choose the later."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, crappy service. Some of the waitresses have no clue what they're talking about when it comes to the many wing flavors. Try the dry rub Cajun and anything extra hot - fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant staff was very rude.  I was there on a date.  We asked if they had an Allstars shot the answer was no if we wanted a larger shot we would have to pay double the price. We were at the bar and ordered our drinks.  Also where we were seated was abousolity stupid.  We asked for something where we could sit together we were seated across from each other right in the middle of the path to the from the Bar to the Dinning Room. We asked if we could sit on the patio.  And we're told they did not have enough staff to cover the patio.  We even spoke with the franchise owner aging he was VERY RUDE to us. We got our drinks had them and left.  We were charged for a double shot even though we never ordered it.  Waitress said cause we asked about a bigger shot she gave us one.  For a double shot of Grand Marnier and a large draft total bill was $26.50 needless to say I will.never be back to this establishment.  One star is too much should be negative 10"}
{"text":"Always amazing. 4 stars because the service has gone a little down hill bit by far the best wings in the area."}
{"text":"The worst possible experience I had on Canada Day in this place! Ordered their \"famous Texas BBQ\" wings and got poisoned by them! Was almost dying for next day or two!!! Never-ever again I would go to this place, and do not recommend to anyone unless you want to harm your health and pay money for it. Just hate this place!!!! I wish there was -10 stars rating."}
{"text":"Came here on July 28 2013 for a birthday drink for my friend. The bartender was really easygoing, friendly and knowledgable about the cocktails. Despite being a summer day the bar wasn't full."}
{"text":"Nearly countless tv's for sports viewing, but this is the only \"remarkable\" thing about All-Star, particularly as it's just another mini- restaurant chain predominantly operating in Southern Ontario. 

Menu is very large, and consists of all the standard \"bar-food\" essentials, but isn't particularly special, other than a massive flavor list for wings. 

1/2 rack Ribs/ (~10) Wings /Fries combo for ~$25 is a decent deal, but wings are pretty small and just mediocre, have had better at The Pump & Turtle Jacks. 

Also, +$2 charge for splitting wing flavours on one order is pretty stingy given the additional labor is minor. 

Paid street parking is cheap ($1/hr), but still an extra hassle compared to Jack Astors/Boston Pizza, and Mississauga Parking enforcement is constantly active in the area. 

Would only return here for TV/event-specific game viewing, if I was looking for a spot to just generally grub up, there are similar quality options in the area at better price points."}
{"text":"Great service, great food snd great location! Strongly recommend it and will go bak!!"}
{"text":"Omg prime time wings are soooo good. Best flavour IMO. Been here so many times and no disappointment ever.

Primetime, every time, all the time."}
{"text":"Okay, all stars has good food but the service at this location is absolutely horrible. I've been there a few times and every visit there has been some type of problem, but today they've lost a few customers. We were made to wait about an hour for our food during which they brought out the wrong food TWICE! When we got up to leave the manager had no idea what was going on and tried to accuse us of ordering and ditching (we still hadn't gotten our food by this time). When we explained the situation she basically looked like a fish out of water and didn't even try offering us any kind of compensation. Congratulations on a horrible job! Don't go here, trust me."}
{"text":"I was there last week on Monday order some wings and beer and got so sick next day . Wings were not cooked properly or maybe they were but they weren't good to begin with. Would never go back."}
{"text":"This former Kelsey's location has everything you are looking for to host a few friends or family members.   nice d√©cor with screens at each booth and on the walls etc.   I brought co-workers there today and I am very particular about how the whole experience presents it self.

They have about 100 different wing favors to choose from and even the very basic mild or sweet and sour.   they also have a cheat sheet if you ask that tell you what the flavor names actually contain.  so if it says Honey Lemon it will tell you that it is honey garlic with lemon.   I myself had the schezwan wings (1LB) about 10 wings - they were delicious and moist and only a very mild spice.  

they also have other foods and we noticed that they server 'Nathan's' hotdogs which are famous in the USA so we ordered one each and they too were delicious.   

Also surprised that for drinks they offered things like pineapple juice and chocolate milk which was a nice addition

very recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Huge selection of flavours, but very artificial tasting. Good size wings and cold beer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. The vibe is pretty chill and for  the girls are pretty cute. Everyone was really nice. The wings were pretty big, bigger than i expected.. only thing i wish i knew what the heck was in each flavour of sauce without having to ask my server everything. It is just soo much selection, i don;t know how they remember it all. Overall, i went with my buddies grabbed a few beers after work , wathced an asweome game, had some fat wings and was satisfied. wish i remembered my servers name. She was pretty cute."}
{"text":"This is the most screwed up place to work. They abuse people verbally and mentally and not give people breaks on time. They have 20 year olds run the place and the owner doesn't have a clue what's going on!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there two weeks ago and since I am writing for another restaurant, may be I should also write it for this famous wings place.

The wings is the main thing.  But first I have been ate take out before from the one in 16th and woodbine.  Well, at that time, only the sauce amaze me because I never ate such a spicy that is tasty but can last for 3 hours ..... (I think we are only eating \"inferno\" level 5 of their spicy level).  But it is small and not that juicy.  This time, the wings I got is juicy with breaded which fills up my stomach too !!  

My wife also order some wedge fries with a ranch tasty that is pretty amazing.  Also, they have kids menu there with 5 wings and fries with a pop drink.  $6.95 I think.

The only thing is you better make Reservation otherwise you probably need to wait around 15 to 20 min, that's the only draw back on that day !!"}
{"text":"Quick service, good food. I had the honey greek wings (on a dare). Was presently surprised they were good enough to enjoy.  Cant go wrong ordering a couple stella's, a basket of single wings and watching soccer for a good price."}
{"text":"*Didn't like that all they had for veggies was celery.
*No lemonade juice (that was important to me)
*Had the spicy bbq...it was okay.
*2 cranberry juices set me back pennies close to 6 bucks (ridiculous).
*facilities were nice."}
{"text":"I have been to an All-Star wings joint in Richmond Hill awhile back and remember they had lots of choices for wing sauces! Too many to the point you not sure which you actually want, even from the least spicy to the most...

Inside the place they had spent quite a bit on TV's! TV is everywhere, from big screen to small for every table. We went there for lunch so it was quiet time and decided to give this place a try again.

Got two burgers...Bacon cheeseburger...Nothing special about it except the burger is dry. I got the Losfer Words with great toppings, such as, pineapple, brie, peameal bacon,  guacamole, suicide sauce and sour cream. Again the issue is dry burger meat. I felt bad when the server ask how is everything, I had to tough it out and said its fine when its not.

The wing flavour choice we got was the 'American Mexican Jerk'. The flavour was quite tangy and a little spicy, but again this place served dry wings.

I know they specialize in wings & ribs, but surprisingly its pretty dry...And one thing I missed about Kelsey which this place took over is that their burger was good! Like 10x better than All-Star. Sry All-Star, you can only get two star from me. Service was fine, but b/c its slow. If their food is continuously like this, I think there may be a new restaurant lingering by soon..."}
{"text":"Got blocked at the entrance by a bunch of thugs (wearing earphones, smoking), asked if I had a reservation and if I don't, I'll have to pay them $20 \"cover\" fee to get in and must order a minimum of $25 worth of food. I don't know if they are associated with All Star wings or not, but really ruined my night. I find it unbelievable that a reputable chain restaurant like All Star Wings would tolerate this kind of extortion activities instead of requesting help from law enforcement to protect its customers and business image."}
{"text":"I wouldn't  even give this place 1 star. The food in the Scarborough location is such a health hazard. I went there monday (my last time) and found feathers still in my chicken. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.  Restaurants are suppose to clean their food before cooking and serving/"}
{"text":"This is a very basic place. Virtually no decor, a ridiculously long list of wing \"flavours\" with no explanation of what they are, and very uncomfortable seating. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as one of our appetizers and were shocked to find that it consisted of 5 very small sticks along with an odd, unidentifiable dipping sauce. The wings were average. Salt and pepper dry wings were extremely salty, and the supposedly hot wings were very mild.  Overall, we were disappointed. Portions are small, prices are high, ambience is nonexistent. There are much better wing places. Don't bother with this one."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was really bad. First the server forgot to key in our meal then she tells us it will be comped then the manager tell us that we will just get a discount. The server barely checked in on us and it was hard to get a hold of someone when we needed to get some water. I know they've only been open for 2 weeks but they have a long way to go!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, waited 20 minutes for a menu and another 20 to get served. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favourite location to eat wings in the GTA. After trying many locations for the best wing I ended here. To begin it has a great atmosphere with more TVs than you can count and every sport playing, coupled with comfortable seats it sets the stage for the culinary marvel that is the wing. This place is always open late and the service is great. Their selection of flavours is massive and unlike other restaurants its actually possible to taste the difference between them. The flavours range from creamy to spicy, to a mix of the two (my favourite) and you can have them breaded or unbreaded. They are served with celery and a dip of your choice.

Note that you can have some of the spiciest wings possible at this place, I have never made it past the a-bomb and if you are a spice-hunter I dare you to try it. They also have a good selection of beers on tap but I think the bartender may be confused on how to serve hard liquor. I once ordered a Jack Daniel neat and it came in a cup with a straw. That said this place still holds the crown for the best wings I've had and on Mondays they have a half pound extra special. I cannot speak to many other items on the menu other than the Greek fries which were also amazing."}
{"text":"1) LOCATION

I've been on the Richmond Hill locations more than I could have ever imagine and it's always a great experience.Talking about the Scarborough location (which I've been twice), I would say it's a much better ambiance. It's a lot more spacious and each table on the dinning has a TV where you can closely watch your choice of game with your group of friends. (Not to mention the other big screens that surrounds the whole place). I would say this is a highly suggested place to hang out. And yes, if you live in Scarborough, this location is at the heart of it.

2) SERVERS

The Richmond Hill location has pretty good and knowledgeable servers. The Scarborough location is okay. We went there on a Monday once and the servers were all just chatting at the front like they don't see us waiting to be served. Other than that, we were fairly served as soon as we got a table.

3) MENU

If this is your first time here, you would be lost at the flavors of wings. There are tons of them and unfortunately, there's no description for every wing flavor. (unlike Wild Wings who do). I'd say this is the major con here.

People have their preference but If I may suggest, in a day you crave for something like mentioned below, I would highly recommend these:

* On the mood for something really hot, spicy and a little salty? Try GOD OF THUNDER
* Feel like having the sweetness of honey mustard and spicy buffalo wings at one shot? Try WINGS GONE WILDER
* Up for something tangy, creamy, spicy and yummy? Try RANCH IS ON FIRE 
* Feel like having a pure taste of jalapeno and chili but tolerable hot level? Try FUNKY CHIPOTLE
* Dont want saucy wings? Try LEMON PEPPER and CAYENNE
* Not a fan of spicy and hot wings? Try CANADIAN DOES TEXAS, HONEY GARLIC and HAIL CAESAR

* Don't eat wings at all?? HAVE THE JALAPENO SHRIMP POPPERS :)

these are from my own opinion and  I would say the suggested wings and flavors above are to die for! :)

I have yet to explore the other flavors. I will gladly share it here once discovered. ;)"}
{"text":"Service here is crazy bad! No one comes
To seat you, you have to find a server to bring you something. The bartenders are not friendly at all.
One afternoon I walked in, self seated myself at the bar and no one came. I sat for over 15 minutes and then walked out!"}
{"text":"I loveeee the wings here.. Compliments to the Chef,! Unlike other places they aren't insanely tiny (comparing to St. Louis) .. They are a fairly good size for what you pay. I usually get Caesar does Texas.. BBQ and honey BBQ were pretty good too. You also can't go wrong with their fries... Crispy and fresh. I can eat buckets of those. 

There seems to be only one happy server whenever we go there, who takes care of other tables which she obviously doesn't need to (she's never our server but yet is always the one serving us with the actual server only combing by like never) ..  The rest most of the time are either chatting it away or pretending like they don't see you because you aren't a hunky guy - I guess they only experience guys giving big tips lol.  

I've yet to try any of their other foods. But I'm quite optimistic. And recently they gave me a drink in a cracked glass cup which probably could have cut my finger/lip if I didn't notice. I understood it was busy with the Raptors Game... But common..."}
{"text":"Horrible service and bad food seems to be the trademark of this place. No one even met us at the door as we walked in, no hostess, nobody! We sat and the service went downhill from there. It must have been a bad day for all because none of the servers ever bothered to smile. 

After asking to try the hot wing sauce to test for \"heat factor\" I was actually denied. I asked twice!! 

After our food was served we didn't see a waitress until it was time for the check, which was fine because the term \"hot wings\" was either a mistake or a plain lie! The wings were not only NOT hot but they were horrible!

We will NOT return."}
{"text":"Can't ask for more when you want sports, wings, and beer. 

Order nero's epilogue and wings gone wild. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I also have had multiple poor experiences with the girls at All Star Wings & Ribs. They don't seem to want to be there or care. I put up with them because the food is usually good. Yesterday's wings were not good, I'd rather have Pizza Pizza's wings. Also, each order is to come with veggies and dip. We didn't get that. I don't plan to give All Star in Vaughan another chance."}
{"text":"Came here after hockey with a few guys from the team.. Where do I even start. We waited for what seemed to be forever just to get are drink orders. Beer tasted old or flat. So we ordered wings and a couple of the guys had a salad. First off our server screwed up our orders and sent the salad out with toppings that were asked not to be put on. I've been to the Richmond Hill location back in the day before the moved and changed management and this was nothing like I remembered.  Food quality was poor along with drinks. When concerns were brought up to management it was ignored. Would I come back again not a chance.  Just disappointing to see that a place that was well known has gone down the drain. Don't be fooled by the large selection of wing flavors. On search for a better place."}
{"text":"My buddy and I recently went to All Stars in Vaughn a few days ago, keep in mind it was our first time here (usually we stick to St.Louis) and the menu was crazy especially all the wing flavours with no descriptions made it awfully hard to pick a good meal.  However, the service here was amazing! Not to mention the unbelievably hott young waitresses that work here!  Our waitress especially did an exceptional job, I believe her name was Loren?? Not many places that we go to give out names of the waitresses, but i found this a good way to communicate with the waitress without sounding impersonal or rude.  Anyways, not only did she make us feel welcome since it was our first visit, but she even helped us pick out a perfect wing flavour for us that i really enjoyed (nero's epilogue?),  Anyways, this is a great place to go if your looking for a good time, food, service, and hot girls!!! We will definitely be back again !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and my experiences are consistently great. If you are coming here for game night, this is one of the best places to be, because the atmosphere just screams sports.  

The wings are great. There are over 200 flavours, which is a nightmare for someone who is really indecisive! After taking 15 minutes to decide on one flavour, I ended up getting the Mardi Gras thanks to a mention from the waitress. I really liked it, even though it was sweeter than I expected. 
The waitress serving me was very attentive and kind. I haven't had to ask for water or napkins once, because she checked up frequently. Also, I was seated next to a TV, which was awesome.
The appetizer I ordered, the jalapeno deep fried shrimp, weren't that great. It was over fried and had no taste to it. If it wasn't for the dip, I wouldn't have ate it. Also, the cheesecake was okay at best. 

I definitely look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Way overrated. Standards are continuously dropping, tons of better places to go. Avoid it & avoid the disappointment."}
{"text":"This location pretty good not the best in my opinion but All Star wings on a whole the best place for tasty wings and such a huge selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Been a fan of this franchise for years, going back to their restaurant in Markham. Mexican Ranchero is a personal favourite. Wings are large, you're likely to get full over fewer wings because of how big they are. Definitely a preferred place for wings when going out with friends."}
{"text":"I came here multiple times with my friends/boyfriend and everytime I had amazing service. I visited the other AllStar locations and this one is my favourite. The quality of the food was always amazing (I usually order beer battered greek fries, ceaser does texas wings or pizza pizza wings.) All the servers are so kind and sweet. This is definetly my go to place"}

Amazing staff...
Perfect manager who try to help you at your convenience...
Lovely atmosphere...
I will go every weekend if I can...
Best wings I got ever..."}
{"text":"Visited the location for a nice dinner after shopping and left in a very terrible mood. The hostess at the from paid no attention to us for 3 minutes while we stood right in front of her. We asked her if there was a wait time, she said 15 minutes and returned to staring at her screen. When other customers walked through the door she politely asked for the number of guests, preference in seat, and asked for their names. We received none of this service. VERY VERY HORRID SERViCE, we were more than disappointed and have no intentions of ever returning to this location again. After 15 minutes we asked a second hostess whether or not we were supposed to provide our names and she was kind to say \"yes\", and apologized for the previous hostess. Regardless of her service we were so unhappy with the fist hostess and decided to leave."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Horrible food. Horrible small ass booths. Horrible wings. And I found a hair in my ice-tea. Horrible. Instead of a shirley temple i got kool-aid. The waitress was nice tho."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Staff are rude. Host and hostesses alike. Very disappointed. Will never go back and will encourage others not to go there...."}
{"text":"THE BEST WINGS!!! I've had almost all the popular flavours are delcious. The best ones in my opinion are Nero's epilogue, Caesar  does Texas, Thunder god, and this is sparta.
honourable mention to desperado"}
{"text":"Our server was Ida. She was sweet and was able to list out what many of the flavours taste like. Really fast with her service too; rarely kept us waiting."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Monday night. To my surprise the wait for a table took just over about 30 minutes but there were multiple games playing which made sense.

My group ordered calamari, box loaded fries and our own flavored wings. Everything was delicious and no one was disappointed. The fries were not the greatest because my group got the regular fries. We didn't know they offered beer battered fries. Definitely will try the next time I come here. 

What made this a 5 star experience was our server, Feliz. She was amazing and very attentive to all of the parties she was serving. She made sure that we had a good time and that we were more than satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is completely average. The wings are pretty good. But wow, ordering them is CONFUSING AS HELL. 

There are over 200 flavours and a lot of them have \"fun\" names that offer no clue to what they are. There aren't even little descriptions below. So it's just a list of words that mean nothing. What is does a \"Kelly man\" wing taste like? My server didn't know. (she was a pretty good server otherwise though)

The loaded potato skins are just four small halves of potatoes with cheese and bacon on them. Not really loaded. What's a potato skin without chives?"}
{"text":"Yum! Wings makes me happy.... anyhow I love this place because they are the only wing's place that I have ocme across that serves delicious grilled chicken wings. They have two choices rilled - with our own House BBQ
Naked King - grilled with our own olive oil and lemon. Glorious!!! I keep coming back for more. I enjoy the atmosphere and how they have tables with your own television. It's nice to have a fave wing place with delicious food!"}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch around 4pm with my mother after a day of shopping. First off, we waited several minutes before being greeted at the door, then were escorted to a two-seat booth near the end of the bar beside the kitchen entrance. We were greeted soon after by the bartender. Our order was taken quickly and drinks were brought soon after. 

Unfortunately, everything took a turn for the worse soon after that. Within a few minutes of receiving our drinks, approximately 3-4 servers and some kitchen staff began loud conversations about two seats from us. There was more noise coming from their table than the entire restaurant combined, which totaled a few tables and some people at the bar. We waited for about 25 minutes for our burgers, at which point we began trying to get a staff member's attention, including the sable of several servers about TWO SEATS away. Unfortunately, we were ignored for several minutes  until the bartender noticed and went to check on our food. Within a minute, she brought out the burgers, however no cutlery, and we had to make two attempts again to get someone's attention to bring some hot sauce. It soon became quite obvious the food must have been sitting in the kitchen for a while because the bread was soggy and the lettuce was warm, but I really didn't wanna make a fuss so I still ate as much as I could. Soon a manager came, but instead of telling the staff to do work or not be so loud, she seemed content to join them. Again after, we had to spend 30 seconds trying to get someone's attention for refills. 

I actually enjoyed the fries and I could tell that burger would have been pretty good, had it not been sitting on the kitchen counter for God knows how long. I have even tried the wings on an earlier visit, and was hoping to be a returning customer. Unfortunately, after that God-awful experience, I will not be wasting my time at such terrible customer service again."}
{"text":"All Stars is a great franchise but this location is poorly run. I'm convinced that they source their meat from a sub par vendor. The wings are noticeably smaller than the Woodbine and Vaughan locations. The wings are also sloppily prepared, sometimes only half sauced. I recommend All Stars as a brand but don't expect good quality if you go to the Scarborough location."}
{"text":"First time, and probably last time here.  Went for lunch and it was pretty quiet, maybe two other tables.  It took 45 minutes for us to get water.  We had to go and find our server twice to get what we needed.  The order was wrong and another was missing.  We spent almost two hours there...a whole lot of wasted time waiting for everything.  It was excruciating.  Food tasted fine but the experience just killed it for us.  Two hours trying to entertain young children was awful."}
{"text":"Wings at this place are good that's what gets at least a star but customer service is horrible! There is something really amiss at this place.
Was here 6 months ago with my husband's youth baseball team and we booked back room for a meeting. Service was fine this time but as we were leaving manager took my husband aside and told him sternly that in order to have back room everyone in our party must spend at least $5.00. A few of parents just ordered pop with rest of us having beer and wings.This annoyed us as we come here lots with our kids sports teams and place was half empty so what was big deal? I wrote to company and they said this was their policy.
Fast forward 6 months and we found ourselves back here for another meeting in back room with a sports team. Different experience this time.
Again place was empty only 5 tables in restaurant taken and we were in back room. There were 4 servers and 1 bartender working.  
Our server was nice BUT clueless. Drink orders were forgotten, orders were screwed up, many wanted to order food and could not get a server. We had to go out into empty restaurant to find a server to take our orders. Worst off she forgot our drinks so after 40 min gave up and served ourselves behind the bar water and pop and nobody noticed. So much for their policy on that back room when you can't get wait staff to take orders. This place is Sooo mismanaged I wonder when it will go under! Too bad as wings are actually decent"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now since it opened. I love the place especially on game nights. Its usually quite busy. The only thing I wasn't too happy with is if you ask for anything like extra hot sauce or gravy they start charging you like crazy. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Busy night for the NBA Finals, so understandably it was packed and we were directed to a table much quicker than I had expected. That was a great start, and all tables are great positions considering they have what seems like 50 TVs in there.

Two stars purely for this isolated experience. 

Half way into our wings, there has already been a couple of wings with blood traces, but we thought oh well, they must be too busy to make sure everything was made to perfection on a full house due to the Cavs vs Warriors game 4. 

Unfortunately this was not the end, and we ran into two wings that are VERY bloody inside and it sure turned our stomachs upside down. We decided to bring this up to the manager so they could notify the kitchen, and settle this uncomfortable situation for us.

She offered to re-make the two wings. That's a very uncomfortable reaction on top of the bloody wings.

After notifying of our discomfort, the manager offered to give us a discount on the bill, that was nice, except when the bill came separately only the friend who raise the issue with her got a 10% discount.

Don't aren't in a short supply of customers for sure, by the demonstration of this problem solving case."}
{"text":"They must have hired a new bunch of waitstaff.

I was there and ordered wings with buffalo sauce. What I got was something else, it looked transparent and tasted and felt just like thickened water with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper powder with no kick at all (meaning, fucking bland.) Complained to the waitstaff, and she told me that buffalo sauce is supposed to be like that. For those who don't know, buffalo wing sauce has a  thick and orange appearance and the moment you taste it the sauce will kick your ass with a strong sour taste and heat. My own piss would have tasted less bland than their thickened water with pepper 'buffalo' sauce. The name of the sauce was something like \"American Explosion\" or some shit like that. Explosion my ass. It surely didn't explode the morning after.

Totally disappointed that they have no clue what they're doing and the waitstaff's attitude. I was in a good mood and didn't want to argue. But I will never go back again. The St. Louis bars and grill down Jane street is where I'm at :)"}
{"text":"I didn't even waste time on looking at the menu, just told the waitress I want the poutine wings (I actually don't even know what is the actual flavour name) but she knew which one I want. The wings came fast, which was good as I was starving. It hitted the spot, I was licking off all the gravy and cheese from the paper so nothing went to waste.

As I was eating and enjoying the Blue Jays game on my personal tv at the booth, I notice they have cheesecake desserts now. This was new... asked the server and she said it was from the same supplier as the Cheesecake Factory. I was debating.... and I caved in and order a red velvet cheesecake. It was served on a big plate. The cheesecake was a little hard as it seems like it has been in a fridge for awhile, not as soft as the ones I've had in the Cheesecake Factory. It is a good replacement when you are craving for it and don't want to drive all the way to Buffalo."}
{"text":"I think All Stars beats most of the other joints for wings. They have over 100+ flavours of wings for you to choose from with a variety of appetizers and drinks as well. My personal favourite is the always classic, Honey Garlic, and Wings Gone Wild which is a mix of honey garlic and hot sauce (I think), well it's sweet and has a chili-spiced kick to it. On top of that, their fries such as the Tex Mex fries are a good starter. Good place to go to with friends to watch a sports event and have a beer. This location is quite big, they have numerous large screen TVs and even smaller TVs at each booth so you don't need to worry about missing out on the action when it comes to entertainment. Service is good, price is good, definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Fair warning if you're going to this specific location be prepared to wait well over 45 minutes for your order. Even if its dead empty...If possible I'd give half a star for their service, foods is delicious .. if you ever get it that is. Due an error with a printer our order was never deliver to the kitchen and we were left without any notice for the server. It was only after 45 minutes I approached her to ask what's taking so long did she tell me. Overall just letting us know we would have been okay to wait. However since she didn't even bother let us know what was going my partner and I ended up leaving quite angry and hungry. Never will we visit this location again, will mostly stick with the Vaughn location. They're service is superb."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Caesar does Texas is my favourite.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to go with friends. The chickens ways taste really good but the service can sometimes be lacking. The food takes a while sometimes, even for just the appetizers."}
{"text":"Lastnight I had a great time at Allstar wings. I felt very comfortable in the beautiful surrounding. My night was made better when Ms. Kathleen, who was a very friendly, beautiful and kind young woman serve me. Her service was excellent. She did a great job. I would like to thank her for making my experience with AllStar Wings a memorable and exciting one."}
{"text":"I came here for Monday wing night with some friends and had the god of thunder wings. I got 15 for the price of 10 so it was a very filling meal. The flavour was good and the wings were big. The raptors game was on and when we won by a buzzer beater the whole place went wild, which made it a very fun atmosphere. I will definitely come back here.

Our table had God of thunder, 5 alarm inferno,  and 10 buck fries (I am definitely trying that one next time)"}
{"text":"They won't seat you without 75% of party. We have 3 out of 7 ppl and it's 8pm on a Monday. They won't even serve starving paying customers. Nobody else is waiting in line. I can understand if it's busy but it's not. Very hangry."}
{"text":"For my Friday lunch, I had the single All Star Wings (Chinese Connection sauce), side garden salad with balsamic dressing and bottomless coke.  All I could taste was the sauce on the skinny wings.  The crisp salad was generous and served in a round bowl.  

This part of my visit was most memorable.  The waitresses in their late teens early 20's were hot looking.  Almost Hooter's-like showing some cleavage.  One wore a short skirt showing slender and well toned legs.  It definitely was the restaurant for males to patronize for the view.

It's not a place I would return on my own.  I would only return if my coworkers wanted to go there again for lunch to look at and interact with the  waitresses."}
{"text":"This establishment is shady! They asked for a photocopy of my credit card after they ran my credit card through their payment system that is directly connected to their bank!! I refused and had them give me a refund and paid in cash!! I will never go there again - something does not feel right."}
{"text":"I would give less stars if possible. I tried to come here with my family of 3 because my son loves their wings. I came 30 minutes before there was a game on and was told that they would only be seating in 15 minutes and only for parties of 4 or more. The tables were completely empty. The servers were really friendly and great with my kid but we won't be coming back. We live closer to another location but come here for what we used to think was great management. I was wrong"}
{"text":"Just went this past Friday and was so upset. 

We complained because the wings were SO SMALL ...like extra small wings. They were so small they were hard to eat. 

What's the manager's response? She knew the shipment that was just ordered was going to be small but there was nothing she could do, it was not her fault!!!!!!!!!!!!

Who says that?????????? You're a chicken wing place! Anyone can copy the sauces. If you're chicken isn't good, you're nothing. 

I won't be going back 60% because of the chicken and 40% b/c the manager gave us attitude. 

Instead go to Duffs which is a 20 minute drive away or Memphis BBQ - their smoked wings are spectacular"}
{"text":"The worst place I've ever been. The atmosphere was good but the food and the service was nothing but boring! Ordered two appetizers and wings, the waitress brought all at the same time including the drinks. By the time we finished eating the appetizer, the wings were cold. Did not get the flavor that we wanted, did not get everything that we ordered but she had them on the bill, good thing we checked the bill and caught it. I wish I can give a 0 star for this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch the game. The wings are delicious.

I highly recommend getting the caligula flavour. (its a bit spicy)

The only knock would be the service from time to time."}
{"text":"Wow...
The wings are amazing and you have to try the nachos.. 
The place is so clean and because of the hospitality definitely I will go there again"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot, service used to be amazing, kitchen staff would not mess up your order or ever make food that was not appealing. However, a lot of the staff has changed and the restaurant is usually empty, they don't play Ufc fights and I find that very unusual because this is a sports bar. Besides that I haven't really seen myself going to this place as much as I would before, this went from being my regular place to eat and watch the game to just a over done mess."}
{"text":"Allstars is the best place ever no other place that I've tried had better wings than this place.

I just recently went I got Pandora wing flavour and it's so good it's not spicy and it's not plain it just in the middle cheers to allstars and there delious wings"}
{"text":"I was at this location on a Friday night, so I will take that into consideration for my review. We arrived about 7pm and were promptly seated, and our serer came by quickly with menus and to take drink orders, ( she knew what they had on Tap) she returned quickly with our drinks and to take our orders. As others have mentioned they have TONS of flavors to choose from, saddly there is NO description of what they are, the servers have notes on what the wings are but it would be much easier if they were on the menu. Personally, I'd take half the flavor with info on them. Our food took a while to get to us, but again it's a Friday and it was getting busy ( 2 world cup games on, and a Jays game) My friend and I settled for 2 single pounds for a total of 4 different flavors and a basket of fries to share. I had the Medium and a Sweet and Honey, or something close to that. My wings were quite cool to almost cold. and my medium wings tasted like Mild- a bland bbq, I thought maybe it was just me so my friend tried one, and he also said there was no heat. My friends wings were hotter( texture wise) them mine were. The fries wern't very crisy and also quite cool. I have been to other locations before and had great food and service, I don't know if it was an off night for them, or that's just how it is there. I may go back, but not in a rush.

Rating out of 5

Service. ***1/2 

Service was good until we placed our food order.

Ambiance. **** 1/2

There is a TON of TV's there. 1 at every booth and I don't now how many surrounding the bar and dining area. It also can get quite noise.

Food. **

The wings are a decent size, but because of getting cold wings, and the sauce not being as hot as it should be, I am giving a low score. I know my server didn't make the wigs but even she said \" shouldn't mild be hotter then medium?"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with this overall rating but thanks to our lovely server Aaliyah and a couple of her other colleagues, this may have been just a 1 star rating. But since they were very attentive and friendly, I'll rate the place 2 stars based on JUST the service.  

We had a reservation for 14 people for 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening and if had walked in the same time as us, you would have also noticed how pretty empty the place was.  But here's the kicker: we weren't allowed to be seated at our actual reserved table/booth until 75% of our party was there.  The first few of us, 4 to be exact, were okay with this so we sat at the bar.  Then more people from our party came which consisted of a family of 4 with 2 small children, including 1 infant.  Still, we weren't given our table.  So my friend asked to get rid of 2 seats so that way \"75% of our party\" was there to be seated.  Still there was hesitation. I do understand if this was during peak hours but again, the place was dead (I've posted pictures for proof) and the hostess could've at least reconsidered this policy *especially* if there are 2 kids, including 1 infant.  No.  The hostess simply pointed them to the benches at the front and told them they can wait there.  

Breaded vs Non-breaded - First of all, there is a huge difference in size.  I mean huge.  But then again, other members of our party had ordered non-breaded and their wings were as small as mine.  So the size isn't consistent. I understand they go by the pound but even that didn't really add up.  I ordered the Greek Homi which was their wings with hot sauce an tzatziki.  It's been my latest go to and though the flavours were there, the wings were small which made them overcooked.  3/5.

Caesar Rings - This was thankfully, not a disappointment.  Though it could've used a little more dressing, it was still satisfying. 5/5.

Hail Caesar Fries - Another go to of mine and it was just as good. Thankfully they didn't get this wrong.  5/5. 

So as mentioned, the service I'll rate 2 stars (more for the hostess and kitchen staff), the servers deserve at least a 5."}
{"text":"Great place if your craving wings! Caesar does texas is delicious. You must get the greek fries mmmm :)"}
{"text":"Food is good - just normal sports bar food, but I especially recommend the Greek fries. The wings are good too but I personally don't recommend the Caesar does Texas wings at this location. The service is amazing but it can get a bit pricey. All in all, a great experience. The only downside is the price."}
{"text":"Came for post-work beers. It was Saturday fight night. Hostess led my co-worker and I to a table in the corner of the restaurant facing a wall.. With no T.V. Um....... Ok?

We asked to be moved, and she led us to the bar where there were 2 seats. Ordered a few pints, no food tho. The Blue Moon on tap tasted old, not bubbly. I doubt they clean their taps regularly."}
{"text":"If anyone has been to buffalo and had chicken wings these are nothing in comparison

If you like different flavours they have a huge variety 

Very clean inside and friendly Waite staff, fries and every thing else is good on the menu but the wing for size and quality are below average. If you are going for wings and want a more true Buffalo style wing I would go to Duffs"}
{"text":"The place is run down and due to that, seems quite dirty and unkempt.  Would have been forgivable if the wings were actually good. Don't waste your time and money. Very dissapointed.  2 stars for pleasant server only"}
{"text":"All-Star nachos are amazing. They don't skimp out on the toppings and or chips. Hail-Cesar fries/rings are also amazing. Pretty loud place Friday, and Saturday but that's the normal crowd noise at a bar/grill type place."}
{"text":"Best wing place on earth!

I was here on vacation and my friends took me to this wonder that is All Star!  Now, i fancy myself to be a chicken wing addict and when i opened the menu to witness the 100s of flavors, i just about overdosed! 

The wings i tried and favorites:
All Dressed-  dry rub of spices, tasty and crunchy just like the potato chips!
Nero's Epilogue- hot wings with blue cheese crumbles. perfect duet of flavors
Where's the Beef-  like poutine on your wings
Vesuvius-  Nero's epilogue but with more buffalo hot sauce
This is Sparta-  chipotle smokey sauce with greek sauce on top (still not sure if i like this one or not)

Also try the Greek fries

I'm coming here everytime i go back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"TL;DR version down below. 

I'm sorry. But these wings are absolutely terrible. 

Hear me out on this. And those who cook at home alot can relate. There is a huge difference when buying wings at somewhere like Fresh Co. Than a Chinese Supermarket. And the Chinese Supermarket wings always have that really funky smell and sometimes taste. Almost as if the refrigerator temp isn't cold enough, or hasn't been refrigerated enough. 

That's what All Star Wings is. 

Those sour smelling... Just funky wings. Fresh chicken does NOT smell like that. And that's what turned me off. Just the sheer smell I got on my first bite. And also the others in my party. 

The fries are so so, nothing to rave about. 2 people in my party got the Greek Fries which were amazing. I got fries with gravy which was only okay. 

I got honey garlic sauce with my wings which had good potential. 

It's quite a shame because the service my party and I got was amazingly superb. The waitresses are gorgeous and attentive. 

The atmosphere is fun, think Moxie crowd. Each booth has 2 tvs for some reason. But like other reviewers said, it is pretty loud. 

I've also been to the I think it's Markham where it is, that other location, and it was even worse because my wings came out raw pink. I don't know what it is with All Star Wings. 

TL;DR - Funky smelling wings. Greek Fries were phenomenal. Save your money and go to City Hollywood, Wild Wing or Buffalo Wild Wings for great chicken wings."}
{"text":"I came here last night around 9:30pm; there was a 20min wait. Finally got seated by the tables next to the bar. Our waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice. The service was a tad slow however even in consideration with the packed restaurant. Our order of wings came in due time; however we ordered greek fries that took extremely long to come out (they must have forgot about it). The fries was a bit salty but overall everything was good."}
{"text":"AllStar Wings is your typical wings restaurant. Their flavours for their wings are extensive, albeit a bit too extensive for my liking. They have so many flavours without any descriptions so I decided to just choose a random one.

The quality of their wings is alright. It's definitely much better than St.Louis, which I personally find to be extremely dry. I got 1lb of wings of the Killer Bee flavour and it had a very nice kick to it. The spicy-ness wasn't too overpowering and the wings weren't dry like I was expecting. Each order of wings comes with 3 celery sticks and a choice of 1 dipping sauce. I would much rather have fries over celery sticks, but I guess it's healthier. 

Our waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us to see if we needed anything. Overall this is a decent place to hang out with friends and watch a sports event."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now an it's always difficult to find something tasty for my non-meat self.  I love the atmosphere here, especially when there is a Leaf game on! 

The gourmet grilled cheese menu has FINALLY come to our neighborhood location....so exciting!! Today I had the Jole Frijole Grilled Cheese and it was good.  Cheddar, Havarti and Pepper Jack cheese with guacamole and cherry tomatoes.  To top it off I had Texas Zinger Brew City Fries.

I am now sufficiently carb-loaded and ready for a good nap.  My delicious Ceasars were garnished with an Extreme pickled bean....yumm!

Will definitely be back for another grilled cheese....which one to get next time?"}
{"text":"We craving some wings, and although we were in the area decided to try this spot out! The service was is excellent and the cleanliness too, that's where he 3 star all go to. As for the food, we ordered an appi of poppers and 2 pound of wings. I felt the chicken had a slight after taste. If you are sensitive about your chicken then it might be something you want to avoid. 

As for what we paid for the above and 1 pop drink was around $50"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. The bartender was more concerned bitching to a coworker about another waitress I was a bother!!! So I looked at the menu chose something, and waited for 10 minutes while I finished my beer. Then she said \"are you getting food?\" Again I was obviously interrupting her bitchfest. So I paid $6.50 for one beer. I wouldn't go back if I was starving!"}
{"text":"Selection of Wing sauces is second to none. There is a flavor for everyone. I recommend Caesar Does Texas, Pandora's Box and Deparado (if you like it spicy).  Been to this location many times and they never disappoint.  Never had anything other than wings or appetizers here, you must try wings if you come."}
{"text":"Just went here for some drinks after lunch, as we wanted to enjoy some patio time. The service was good and the patio was great."}
{"text":"Been here a few times but will base this review on my most recent visit. 

- great food!
- great service! (And this isn't always the case)
- great atmosphere!

Came here for dinner on a last minute group decision. There were 7 of us. We got seated in a booth and unfortunately didn't fit but our waitress was more than happy to move us! 

This was on a Monday night. They had a special: buy a drink and get 1 1/2lbs of wings for the price of 1lb. It kind of evens out anyway cuz of the drink but still not too bad! Everyone at the table got this special buttttt I got a burger cuz I was really craving one! This was my first time ordering something other than wings here and I was quite impressed! It was either really good or I was just really craving a burger! Lol

I got the cinco de mayo burger on a kaiser bun. It actually took me a while to decide, none of the burgers really stood out to me for some reason. I was unsure about this one but it turned out to be really good! Portion was perfect and burger was juicccy! Could've been a little spicier personally but still enjoyed it!

Fries were soggy, gross But overall everyone else was quite happy with their orders too. Food came out at a reasonable time and everything was cooked well! 

The shitty part about buying wings here is that there are so many damn flavours and no descriptions to what's in it....it can get quite annoying and frustrating to have to ask the server every single time. So this time, we all used our phones to check their website for a full list of the sauces and what's in them, much easier and quicker. 

Our waitress was very very friendly, made small talk, very genuine and knew the menu well! With the kind of service and food we received, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some friends took me there while on a business trip to Mississauga and I fell in love. The ambiance was great and the food was amazing. The staff was friendly and very helpful when it came time for me to order. So many choice of wings and it so hard to pick just one. 
Place is clean, great staff, amazing wings and the best part is the cheesecake.
Cant wait for one to open in Montreal"}
{"text":"So each time I come back it still good service...all the staff are super friendly...the food is pub style etc wings...service is good very quick the food is also ok can't go wrong with wings ,they accept all types of payment cash credit debit ...most nights are good Friday and Saturday is busy..seating is more than ample..lots of tv to watch sports...the staff work hard especially at the bar..Lindsay manager is awsome she is the reason the bar is so well run.."}
{"text":"Not the best place for wings. For a \"wings\" restaurant, the menu is incredibly useless. It lists all 200 flavours together without sorting them by flavour or type. Your best bet is just telling the waiter what you typically like and going with what they recommend. Avoid the jalape√±o poppers; it's basically a deep fried red pepper (not jalape√±o) with a little bit of spice.

Great place to catch a game though!"}
{"text":"was here for a friend's birthday. We were sitting at the bar and were a group of 10. 

the server was very attentive and made sure to bring us more things as we needed it.

the owner even came around and chatted with everyone to make sure thing were well - I appreciate a business owner who takes pride in ensuring his customers are satisfied.

we weren't rushed despite the line at the door!
 
they have a good amount of TVs to watch as many games as one wants with sound playing on the main game.

The wings were flavourful and a good portion, no one seemed unhappy with their food."}
{"text":"I love wings. I love all the variety of sauces. I HATE having to ask my server what is in every flavour. Why can't you just out what that clever name for the sauce is on the menu? 

If you have the patience to try to figure out the flavours or ask your server then you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Usually I would rate this place good as I've been going to all star when there was just one location out in the Richmond hill area so many years ago. I've been going to this location for a while now that's it open and closer to me than the one in RH. I went there to watch the raptors playoff game and got there early. Place was very empty with lots of tables available. Hostess says the place is booked for the raptor game (not starting for another 90 or so mins). I said but you have so many empty tables right now. Who books an entire restaurant full of reservations unless it's a private event? Spoke to the manager and all she said was we can give you a table for now and if a reservation doesn't show up, then we can stay, otherwise we have to leave when they show up. Really? That's the customer service she was offering. We were only two people so it's not like we were gonna take up a lot of space. So in essence stay far far away from this all star location as the service is horrendous."}
{"text":"I frequent this place about once a week. Food is okay but staff is generally nice and it's a great place to catch a game. I order the same sauce on my wings each time and it never tastes like the time before...no consistency. I once asked for another sauce to be added to my wings and was told I could have it on the side not on top of the wings because \"they are very particular not to change the flavors of the wings\". It's an odd reason considering the fact that my wings taste different every time I go! I said can't you just squeeze some sauce on top rather then squeezing in into a side container and again was told no. I found it very strange that a paying (regular) customer could not customize their oder at a restaurant.  Had I asked for extra mayo on my burger would they have insisted not to change the taste of the burger? They gave me a tiny bit of the extra sauce on the side and charged me for it. Oh and if you're wondering, the same wing sauce I ordered was once again different than the time before. If you expect consistency, and decent service probably not the place to go."}
{"text":"1 star because there is no option to give less. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. They say they validate parking on the front sign but don't tell you they only validate after 5pm. So you park underground, you sit down only to have to go back to PAY for your parking. After finally getting a menu, and drinks, their soft drinks were flat. No apology. Nothing. We then asked to order a few different things, they didn't have two of the items that their menu listed. Service is horrible, food is mediocre at best. Save your time and your money, go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"My favourite place for wings. I like the vibe and the service is prompt. The staff was very friendly and they went above and beyond to make sure we were pleased with our meal."}
{"text":"I've been to this location quite a few times. I've tried a number of items on their menu now. I've tried Pandora's box, ceaser does Texas, and quite a few other ones but my favourite wings here have got to be Vesuvius!!! It is so good, a must try if you like creamy wings that have a bit of a kick. Kleopatra is a little similar to Vesuvius in creaminess, however it's a little sweeter with no spice at all. The sweet potato fries were good, especially the dip that it came with, but I must say, the Greek fries and the hail ceaser fries are always a hit in my books! Overall, good place if you're in the mood for some wings!

Went even more recently and got Vesuvius, Pandoras gift (honey garlic but hot) which was very complementary to Vesuvius. Also got the greek fries and all in all, all three did a really good job of complimenting eachother."}
{"text":"Bring a coat if going to this restaurant in the winter time...it was frigid in the entire restaurant!!! We got the Nero's Epilogue and Hot Honey wings. They were ok. I would go to Vaughan location I had to do it again. The have better wings and heat!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks. The waitresses didn't serve us. We waited for a while and tried to make eye contact with them. None of them were responsive. A random guy came in and they served them right away. Not sure why they didn't care to serve us. We clearly wanted to try out their menu because it looked so bomb. Food looks amazing, never tried it, the service is horrible. Save your buck and go to another location, because this one sucks and clearly needs to train their staff to be efficient."}
{"text":"There are no descriptions next to the wing titles so its really annoying having to ask the server what are the toppings. Service here is good even on wing nights (Mondays, buy one pound get one and half pounds which is awesome especially if theres a Raptors game. Service is good, fast and servers are polite."}
{"text":"Maybe not just this place specifically but all stars in general. All stars is my favourite wing place. Their wings are bigger and has more sauce. Not just that their list of sauces is extensive but the amount they pour and toss into each pound is plenty. 

My two favorite flavours for now would be neros epilogue and wings gone wild(er) 

Now let's talk this location specifically. As usual, all stars staff all know what they're talking about!! I can just point at random names and ask them what's inside and they know off the top of their heads. Amazes me each time haha, and I don't just ask about one or two.. Service here is good even on wing nights (Mondays, buy one pound get one and half pounds). There usually is a smile with your meal and staff are patient. They don't try to hurry you even if you ask too many questions. 

Definitely my go to wing place around this area."}
{"text":"I love All Star Wings among any other wings joint in Toronto and this location is no doubt the same (based on taste).

I enjoyed my usual pound of Blue Honey (blue cheese and honey garlic) quite a lot. They don't smoother too thick of blue cheese sauce onto the wings as much as Wild Wings, yet the flavour blends just right.

Another flavour I've tried was the dry rub of Roasted Garlic & Pepper. I rarely have dry-styled wings but this was surprisingly delicious! It did not make the wings dry at all but seasoned with the right amount - not salty either.

The downside of this location is service. Perhaps it was the lack of staff but that's no excuse. We were seated in a booth and the waitress gave us our water. She disappeared for a long while and had to flag down in order to get our food orders in.

Secondly, when the wings came, there was no bone bucket, utensils or napkins provided. Again, the waitress had to be flagged down very difficultly.

In general, service was not great. I would give points to the fact that this location has TVs all around and for each booth - great place to keep up with Olympics!"}
{"text":"My 8year old twins, like a lot of kids, prefer to get dirty when they eat. They absolutely love when we go to All Star Wings & Ribs. The menu alone for wings makes them very happy, which makes me happy. My hubby and I love Pandora box and Hot Buddha and boys always get Cheesy. IMO, the restaurant offers good quality; homemade style food that appeals to everyone. The portions are filling, the prices are excellent and the staff is both knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend All Star Wings and Ribs to anyone who is looking for good quality, home made style food that is filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!!!!  We went at 2 on a Monday. Service was slow, waitress was pushy when she did come see us.....rushing us to order and then ignored us almost until the time to pay. 

The food. Oh the food.....less than spectacular and borderline gross the sweet Thai chili wings weren't spicy at all.....basically they were just sweet Thai. The garlic parm were covered in powdered fake Parmesan cheese. The chicken tenders, fries, and onion rings all appeared to come out of a frozen bag.....just not worth $50 at all.  I would say avoid and choose Popeyes across the street!"}
{"text":"My recent visit has been very disappointing. 

At first, all of our party hasn't arrived yet, it was just half of us. For unknown reasons, they wouldn't seat us unless the majority of us were there so, we had to wait at the front till everyone came. Seems like some minor arbitrary policy they had so we were happy to wait, still pointless.

Our server was attentive in the beginning until we ordered everything then that's when the service went down hill. She pretty much disappeared on us. She maybe checked up on us once and after that we probably didn't see her for another half an hour or longer, we ended up staying there close to 3 hours. I'm assuming because they force gratuity on us, we had more than 6 people, that she probably stopped carring knowing it was guranteed she would get tipped. We had to ask other waitresses that frequently passed by us for our own. How am I seeing other waitresses more frequently than the one that was serving us? In the end it took us a while to even get our bill. 

It was the little things that kept adding on which lead to a disappointing experience. Overall, maybe I and my group will give it another chance in the future.  Hopefully they'll actually do their job all the way through next time."}
{"text":"Had a great time!! 

We seated ourselves at the bar area. Server came quickly and had great energy. She was quick, funny, witty and went out of her way for us. 

We ordered the famous Greek fries, which were yum! Get them beer battered. They put the sauce all over so next time I would request the sauce on the side, it can be overwhelming. Initially we ordered two pounds of wings. We realized we got too much food and Sabrina was able to cancel that order at short notice. We had the lemon pepper wings and they were hot, meaty and flavourful. They give a huge bucket for bones and garbage! 
Our drinks we chill and refreshing. I liked the place a lot because it was st pattys day and it was very vibrant. The had leprechauns handing out gold coins!!!! Sabrina was awesome and totally made up for the other place I went to with bad service."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time now and it was a better experience. The first time the waitress didn't really know what she was doing and forgot about us. I came today with my girls and it was busy but we still managed to get a booth in the bar. I don't like that you don't know the flavors and I always feel bad about having to ask so I end up sticking with what I know. I really like Nero's Epilogue. It's creamy and hot. They should serve carrots instead of the celery cause I really hate celery but not a deal breaker. The atmosphere is just like kelseys and not like their other locations which is kind of meh. It's nice that it's close. I only really care to come when I get a wing craving but I think there are still nicer bars to check out if you want to get wings and drinks and watch the game. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has a strange vibe. Food was decent and so was the service."}
{"text":"Poor service...place is run down. Needs staff training and building upgrading. Great tasting food. Cold beer."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a sporting event with friends. Watching the Raptors. Since then I have been back and it never disappoints with the service and food. The wings are great with an endless variety of ways to have them. The service is always good nothing to complain about after being there countless times. I have been there with the guys and on family night.  No one else in the group that I have been with have anything negative to say about the staff and the menu. Great for kids or just a night out with friends."}
{"text":"This is always a hot spot that is quite busy, better than Wild Wings. Let's talk about the food, service and prices.

The food is always good here. The wings are great, burgers are filling and the beer battered fries are awesome. The only thing is, the wings are waaaay too saucy, and even when I request for lightly sauced, it's still soggy when it reaches my table. The greek fries are stellar, but for some time, they always told me it's sold out every weekend or so which is the amount of times I'd go lol. Food is great, definitely recommend. 

The service here is always ehh. So okay, I know the profile of the servers here, but I didn't know having so much attitude and acting like they're too good to work here was part of the job profile. They always avoid eye contact when you need their help. Every time I would ask what a flavor was, I was just given a general description - \"honey garlic and spicy\". Even asking right after of other multiple flavors, same answer. Well damn, if every flavor is \"honey garlic and spicy\", the people naming the flavors were creative enough to create over 100 names for the same flavor. 

The price used to be about $11.95 or a lb and now about $14 which I think is quite a jump, especially with tax, and drinks and appetizers. I have noticed the amount of wings I get are significantly less than a pound. But they dredge it and pour sauce in the basket, so it weighs more. 

Overall the food is good, just the service here and price is meh."}
{"text":"****This review is for TAKE OUT**** I've been to all stars before and generally the food is great and the wings are delicious, but something goes wrong when you order take out. The portion was smaller, and this is the second time that they forgot the celery sticks! Even asked them if there were celery sticks in the takeout bag and they said yes, but there were none :( I love their wings but I don't think I'd do take out again. It's just not worth the price."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner but ended up ordering take out because it was too crowded and we couldn't get seats after about 20 minutes. But then we also waited for another 30 minutes for the take out.
The flavors we chose were BBQ and sweet & sour. They both take delicious. 
This place offers a lot of flavors and it's very fun if you want to try out. The price is also very decent. 
I will most likely go to the restaurant again, although maybe try out a different location."}
{"text":"Terrible food, wings deep fried so many times by the time we ordered they served it to hard as rock.  I could find the meat!  No joke. The atmosphere is great if you love to hang out with 19 year olds, rowdy, loud and hammered.  Hense, the food would have been great if I was drunk.  I rather go to Wendal Clarks Sports restaurant which also has the TVs in each booth which I love!  Also, the night we went there was only tiny little 19 year old girls working...what if a male or female fight broke out?  Sure there may be male cooks- but by the time they got out it would be too late!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the place to go if you're a fan of wings! I had never been huge on wings until I went to this place. Afterwards I couldn't get enough! Since I'm always travelling it's hard to come here often and I've tried very hard to find another place with the same flavors, texture, and crisp but have been unsuccessful so far! I love that they have so many great flavors and their sauces are actually spicy and tasty! My all time favorite is god of Thunder with perfect concoction of spiciness, creaminess, and a kick to it. Other noteworthy flavors are desperado, my ranch is on fire,  & bloody Mary. To top it all off, their Godiva chocolate cheesecake is to die for!!!! I can never get enough of this place and they need to open some branches in the US!"}
{"text":"We had a craving for wings, and wanted to try some place new, and some place we could watch Italy vs England.

When we got there, we had to wait for the hostess to finish \"setting up the tables on the patio\" before we could be seated...thought that was odd...perhaps it was because of the larger amount of customers because of the game?

It's hard to find a place that sells good wings, but i was impressed with this place. So many flavors to choose from, but we got Garlic Parmesan, Cajun, Honey Garlic, and Hot. All were delicious. The fries were a bit soggy, but the wings made up for it.

I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I will say there is limited parking but I walk so that doesn't affect me so much. My experiences have all been great! The staff are nice although sometimes a bit strange. But the srvice is fairly fast and the food is very good! The wings are great and there are also great options for gluten free people. Here are some flavors I recommend:
Honey BBQ
Cleopatra
Greek Honey
Piza Piza
Pandoras Box"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch...but it was so dirty we changed our minds and just had a couple of overpriced $8 drafts."}
{"text":"To be honest I have been to this place multiple times but it has recently just lost its usual standard. The wings are no longer the same they used to taste better now it's not the same. However, the flavors are still amazing and worth a try if you have never been. Maybe the other locations still make the wings better. Try the Vesuvius, wings gone wild and bubbas backfire flavors."}
{"text":"Really nice place and great atmosphere! Right across the street from where I live so also convenient. Nice patio setup. Will be there again for sure"}
{"text":"Arrived 45 minutes before closing (12:15am)

Took us awhile to get seated but the waitress me and my girlfriend had was quick and nice. We ordered spicy plum, ranch on fire and an appetizer of calamari to start. Everything came in order and within 15 minutes.

Food - 8/10 
Wings were really saucy but still had the crisp to it.  Calamari was good

Sports bar with tvs everywhere. Had a nice conversation with the waitress. Been to this All Star location plenty of times and have never been disappointed with the food, service is good here and there.  

Overall: good experience"}
{"text":"So I came here with a bunch of my friends and about to order from this huge list of wings, so I ask the waitress what's her favourite type of wings and she's like \"I don't usually eat here \" like wtf who says that so then I tell her I don't want to eat here either :) thanks and bye but then I sat back down and asked for a new waitress :)"}
{"text":"Location: 3130 Rutherford Rd, Vaughan, ON L6A (across from Vaughan mills)
Price:$$
Service: good

Love this wing place. Deep fried wing heaven! Their ribs may not be as good but their wings are to die for. They have 100+ flavours and you have the option of having the wing breaded. 

My favourite flavour is Pandora's box and Me love you long time; both flavours are sweet and spicy. Their single serving has around 10 big wings ($11). It doesn't come with fries but you can live without it. Their fries are not that yummy anyways. 

Every Monday they have a special for wings. I believe it's 2lbs for the price of one. It's obviously a bar so if you're hoping for quiet space it's not the place. However, it is not rowdy and rude that you are not able to bring in children. The service is good, I haven't had an issue for the amount of time I've been there. 

Verdict: Cheers!"}
{"text":"The service is garbage at this location. Twice in a row now the girls serving have no people skills and borderline rude. It took a long time to even get someone to come to place us at a table when the place was basically empty. 
Go to the Vaughan or Markham location instead, and get your penny's worth of service."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this restaurant negative stars, i would. But instead, ill just give a negative review, because i had a very negative experience. Went there tonight for a friend's birthday and had the worst dining experience of my life. Not busy in here, maybe 4 tables besides my own. No server came over to see us, waited 15 mins then went to the bar to order. Was ignored once more at the bar and told a server was going to be right over to the table. When she dropped off my drink, someone tried to check on their appetizer that they had been waiting for for over 30 minutes. Im not joking, everyone else got their food. The server FINALLY came over and forgot everything at least once, took 7ish minutes to deliver even napkins. Ridiculous. Im in the industry and so are my friends and i have never received such poor service. She kept having to check back maybe 3 times for what we had just said to her 30 seconds before. Im not surprised that this place is going out of business and ive never had such terrible service and i will be telling everyone to never come here.

Also, the supervisor/manager who was working the floor (as the servers were not present to provide any service) was extremely rude and had no leadership skills in terms of being able to direct her staff to accomodate to the customers' needs. She would point to blank space when we asked for our drinks/bills and would just yell across the restaurant \"oh, she is getting it\".... When noone was in fact doing any of it. 

Careless staff who really do not know how to succeed in the service industry."}
{"text":"I dont know - this is my second time at this locations and both times the experience have been pretty bad. The first time i got a dry rub with so maaany feathers. Management wouldnt replace it or take it off the bill. BUZZ KILL!

However after being pressured by a friend- we end up going back for lunch .  The hostess seemed upset about something and literally walked us to a table and dropped the menu. Our server took a while - actually i think we flagged another server to order some drinks. We finally get our server- and ask if there are lunch menu's. She said I have to go get it from my manager. 15 mins later - she comes back apologizing that she cant find the menu.


So we ask her does she know on top of her head and she responds, \"im not sure but i think its fivee wings and fries for $6.99\" . Why she never divulged this info - i dont know. I take her up on her offer and we order four specials. Finally 15 mins later our drinks come. However glass was broken. Literally followed her to the bar to get a cup as now i have lost faith in her tardiness. 40 mins passes by. No food. Hungry men anxious for wings. 

Out of frustration- i flag down the waitress and ask about her food. She responds - \"oh yeah- we are our of powder for one of your flavours\". Grrrrrrrrrr

So we go to cancel it and now that i rant about service lets get to the food. Wings were good sized but their menu definitely exaggerates their flavors. The four fire burning visuals on the menu did not live up to their imagery. Mild suicide at best. The jerk wing were watered down. It wasnt impressive,

The greek fries were really amazing tho. like REALLY REALLY good.

all star wings? meeeh...more like trying hard to stay in the league wings"}
{"text":"One of the best wing places in the GTA!  They have over 100 flavors of wings...literally they have about 150 or so.  If you are brave enough to eat the A Bomb wings then make sure you post your victory pictures because everyone would be uber jealous of your victory--er---courage!

Some of the more practical flavors are Neros Epilogue, Hawaiian Honey, Killa Bees, and a variety of other great tasting wings.  This location has everything you ask for in a wing joint.  Pretty waitresses, beer, wings, and a Ton of TV's that show the latest and greatest sports games!

Make sure you call and make reservations on the weekends as it tends to get extremely busy.  Also, if you are ordering wings during superbowl weekend I recommend you pick them up at least 2 hours before the game starts to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible. Its a hit and miss depends when you go. Food is average & prices are meh. People just go to to watch sports and for drinks. Food takes forever as well."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying their wings are a stones throw away from the best wings in the GTA, but hot damn are they delicious. Now people will say \"OMG DEY HAZ OVER A HUNNID (100) DIFFERENT FLAVOURZ OF WINGZ\" but that's no reason to come here because 70% of those flavours are either too similar or do not work at all. I highly recommend the bloody cesar's wings, they along with pandora's box and the desperado wings are the real HAVE to try wings. They also offer a full range of different poutines, burgers and newly added grilled cheeses, which for the most part, are all very delicious. Trust me I've been coming here since the first day they opened and have been going to the Thornhill location for years before. The ten buck fries are epic, just loaded with beef chunks and melty gooey cheese and gravy (and bacon!). Hail Cesar fries and the greek fries (ohhh the greek fries) are super delicious and addictive especially they're greek onion rings, oh lord. Honorable mention would have to be the cheesy where's the beef wings. They're deep fried wingy goodness smothered in cheddar cheese and thick dark rich gravy. Basically a poutine on wings sans the frites (that's without the fries for you simple folk). The mexican fries are also a win here. Highly recommend this place, the service has always been spot on but they've had their days. All in all a great sports bar pumping out great food not to mention the wait staff is easy on the eyes which is always a plus but not necessary. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent wing experience. A spacious sports bar wing and rib place, situated like your typical patio restaurant with booths for smaller groups and long tables to accommodate big groups. I don't watch soccer but I liked that there were TVs everywhere so you could enjoy wings and catch the game on several screens. Booths itself have their own TV to watch from, and large tables can watch from screens surrounding. More spacious than St. Louis - seating is accommodating. Also, bigger wing sizes. I liked the variety of the wings and flavours to choose from, but I wish the menu described what the sauces were made of because I had to guess and hope it tasted as I liked. I got the honey teriyaki single pound wings, non breaded and it was white good. Lots of flavour on the outside, less so on the inside but that's okay - I just used the blue cheese dip for taste. I'm not a person who goes out to have wings or ribs often (I like to make my own), so I don't have much to compare this too besides St. Louis, and I like it more. :) Not amazing or anything, but decent place with casual ambience."}
{"text":"All Star Wings and Ribs has finally arrived in Scarborough.   My high school friends first introduced me to the chain and I've been hooked ever since; subsequently we would all pile into cars and make the trek all the way up to the Yonge/Elgin Mills location as a go-to reunion spot.  Now it's just a mere 10 minute drive.  But other than the fond memories and the spirit of comraderie that remains, this location pales in comparison, specifically when it comes to service.

I have been twice, once for dinner and once for lunch and I have to say that the service staff are ill-trained for peak hours (read, weekends and evenings).  They do fine during lunch hour when it's less busy, but I suggest you make the servers repeat your order and when they bring the food and ask you if you need anything, think long and hard as you most likely won't see them again until it's time to grab the bill.  

Newbies will be intimidated by the sheer choice and to add insult to injury (not to mention slower turnover); is the fact that there are no descriptions listed as to what the offerings are.  Like how is one to know what the heck Caesar Does Texas is?  If you ask the servers, they will pull out their cue cards and read you off your selection, which I think just further delays everything.  Their explanation is that their entire business model and success relies on their recipes so they don't put it on their menu.  Really?  

Some of the spicy wings really will burn your tongue off.  We asked for a recommendation sweet/spicy and suffice it to say that for each wing we ate we had to chug a pitcher of water between 3 people.  It ended up being repurposed in a fried rice and even then you could still feel the heat.  Not enjoyable at all.

My favorite flavors are definitely OPA (Greek seasoning + Feta) as well as Caesar Does Texas (Caesar dressing with some hot sauce).  For those who want to be \"healthy\" you can opt for the unbattered version of the chicken wings, but that will tack on another 30 minute wait.  And really, you're out for chicken wings - live a little."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a bit loud for my likes but at least it's a lot cleaner then it was as a Kelseys.

The wings are good and the selection is amazing. The beer selection sits somewhere between mediocre and horrible.

I'm really not the right guy to be reviewing this bar because it seems best suited to someone who is just there to watch sports.

After that all being said however I would still gladly come here again."}
{"text":"I have been to a few of the All Star Wings locations... but hands down this one is the best.  Why?  Their batter is FRESH... none of that year-old oil.  Their batter is not overkill like some other wings places.  Usually if the batter is thick, it is trying to mask unfresh wings.  We ordered:

OPA (by far one of my favourites! Sprinkled with greek herbs and feta!)
Honey (a bit of twang from the mustard, and not too heavy on the sweetness factor, and they don't overdo the sauce either)
Mile High Ranch (the creamiest wings I have had in my life, what?!)

It was busy as it was hockey night MTL vs. TOR.  I live in Scarborough, but I would definitely drive 30 minutes to go to this All Star!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, the service is terrible, and the food is mostly terrible. Cajun shrimp was OK but everything else I tired was bad. 
But the service is really what made me want to give it one star, every time I went there was an issue. 
The worst of which being when they took 30 minutes to bring me the Cajun shrimp appetizer, and she didn't check on us during that whole time for me to even ask her about it. I had to go flag down another server to help us with that issue. And after that again for another 30 minutes nobody checked on us and I eventually had to get up and go to the bar to ask for our check. The staff basically acts like a bunch of bratty teenagers running a restaurant. they just don't care."}
{"text":"Beware: New menu = price increases across the board. No longer desirable to come here as often as we used to. Still good food just not worth it. For example I think the wings were $11.99 before. They're $13.45 now. Loaded poutine was 8.25 before, now $9.75. Just some examples. Desserts look like they're the same price though"}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing special, but the service on the other hand was horrendous. My family decided to go at around 2 pm on a Sunday, it was pretty much empty. Upon walking in, we weren't even acknowledged as it looked like the 4 staff at the front were in a heated conversation. After standing there for about a minute they finally noticed us. Very unprofessional and horrible first impression.

Server didn't check on us once the whole time and had to be flagged down to get the bill. She was socializing with the other waitresses in the corner the whole time. After we paid, didn't even say thank you or have a great day, nothing.

Definitely would not come back or recommend after that experience."}
{"text":"Terrible wings, charged grat '15%' (but actually put down 25%)"}
{"text":"I went to all stars with a bunch of friend, we ended up order 100 wings between the four of us. I think we got Pizza, texas honey, Pandora box  and  I forget the last favourite. 

Give it was 80 buck with tax it was pretty sweet deal, I think waitiress was surprised we finished all those wings but it was four hungry dude, and two of us (one being me) were big guy so we could eat. Definity coming back woith the guys for wings

Only thing i didn't like is that favours didnt have a description so we went on what we though was good, and just asked but it was alright"}
{"text":"Love this wing joint! They offer over 100 flavours of wings in varying spice levels. The wings are flavourful and huge! Perfect night out with a bunch of friends to chow down on wings and watch a game.

On Mondays, it's wing night where you get an extra half pound of wings for the price of one. Pretty good deal especially if you're super hungry. 

Make sure you make reservations on Fridays and Saturdays because it usually gets packed especially when there is a sporting event.

This location is pretty decent with many tables and TVs but dont expect good service since it's usually busy."}
{"text":"After a day of flogging er golfing my friends took me to All Stars for a few libations and some wings. Being a first timer the wing sauce options were a bit overwhelming. After a couple of cocktails and with an assist from our server I was able to decide on one of their hot sauce wings. As advertised the wings were fabulous. Loved the heat as it was definitely there but not overwhelming. We shared our wing orders and they were all nicely done. 

Service was very good even though they got busy toward the end.
Plenty of TVs were available and when we asked for one of the TVs to be changed for the hockey game tit was done pronto. Great sports bar with good food!!"}
{"text":"The service here is hit or miss but I always come back regardless of my previous experiences because I'm a sucker for their wing flavours. Sometimes I get seated right away, the waitress is great, and the food comes out quick. Other times, I want to just leave the restaurant and eat at the McDonald's across the parking lot. 

I came here with my friends last Saturday night. We were a group of 10 people and it was a busy night because the Jays were playing so I understood that we had to wait a while to be seated. However, our waitress was horrible and the kitchen staff were particularly slow that night. Although friendly at first, our waitress forgot drinks and food orders, didn't bring enough plates, and constantly avoided our table even though we made eye contact while trying to call her over. We waited 20 minutes for our fries to come and almost an hour for our wings. 

Wing flavours that I recommend
Creamy: Cleopatra, Bloody Caesar, That's Amore, Nero's Epilogue
Sweet and Spicy: Pandora's Box, That's Amore, All Thai'd Up, Thai Homi
Very Spicy: God of Thunder"}
{"text":"Myself and a guest went specifically for wings (and a few pints). True to its name, there was a full page of wing sauces with all sorts of names such as \"This is Sparta\", \"Me Love You Long Time\" and \"Wings Gone Wild\". Though some may appreciate the gimmicky nature of the names and the vast selection, to me, it was more like playing roulette and hoping that you'd get something good.  Our server ran to get a cheat sheet to start rhyming off some descriptions of what the names meant in relation to sauces used.

I went with \"Wings Gone Wild\", breaded. The wings were on the larger side, meaty, juicy and served hot in temperature with a light breading. The sauce, however, was just odd. Not offensive but not great. It contained a subdued taste of grainy mustard with some sweetness and barely a hint of heat.

The wings are good enough that having a smaller selection of their best flavours or at the very least put descriptions of the sauces next to the name would have done more justice to the wings.

As for everything else, service was friendly and efficient. The decor was clean and modern with plenty of TV's and the place was well maintained."}
{"text":"Food was great. My friend and I both got wings. I got Desperado which is ranch sauce w/ hot sauce and Mexican seasoning and my friend got Cheesy Where's the Beef? Both were really good! If you get Desperado I suggest asking for extra sauce. For dessert my friend got the Godiva chocolate cheesecake - SO GOOD! 

Atmosphere was great as well. TV in every booth 

Service sucked!! Not sure if it was because it was 1AM but I feel that's more of a reason why service should be good considering how little customers were there at that time."}
{"text":"Recently took our kids out for dinner, the place seemed busy and we were asked to wait for our table to be ready, once it was ready we realized it was right near the front door, which we didn't want to be seated there since the smoke from the outside was making it's way into the front of restaurant, and since we were there with young kids we requested we wait for another booth.

Although the girls at the front seemed a little annoyed by our request- in the end of the day as any parent knows- kids come first.

A little while later we got our booth (with a tv with a kids channel on) which was what the kids were really looking forward to!

We had the waitress show us all my gluten free options, which after reviewing and attempting to order we were later told that item after item I had requested was not 'actually' gluten free, although it was labeled so on the menu- for example wings, and loaded potatoes wedges - because they are drop fried in a fryer which also cooks breaded food.....
So I was basically left with 2 options, salad (which is always the option) and the wings to be grilled. I agreed to both options (which I later learned I was charged extra for the wings and and the sauce) which was a bit of an unpleasant surprise.... at least if we were given a heads up....
The salad I ordered was a bit soggy and the vegetables were tasteless since they were not ripe enough....
I had the manager visit me at the table to review my order and to confirm my order which was very nice..

Once our kids were done their main meal, we asked what desert comes with their meal- the server told us there was no dessert... and we can order from the dessert menu..... and she acknowledged  by saying, in her words;  'I know dessert comes with kids meals everywhere but here'..... so we had to order 2 separate desserts- which I was told were good, but would it really have hurt to give the little ones 1 scoop of ice cream??

My husband ordered the steak and mash, which in my opinion was dry and tasteless but he seemed to fine with it.

Over all not a fantastic experience but not horrible either... needs some improvement. I think we will give this place another try some time in the future but not any time soon...."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with my friends (5 of us) at around 9:30pm. The wait was about 30mins but we were seated after 20mins. 

We placed our orders 5mins after we were seated. Three of us ordered wings while the other two ordered appetizers only. It seems like we just missed the busy time because multiple tables were finishing up and paying. 

Normally whenever I come here, my table would receive our orders within 15mins but this time we waited closer to 30mins. When our food did finally come out, it was good. The wings aren't as big and crispy as I remembered but the flavour is still good. 

In the future I probably won't go during the weekend when it gets super busy but opt for weekday or not dinner time on weekends."}
{"text":"You would think as time passes, experience would make a business better. Years ago, I fell in love with All Stars, giving it a perfect score. However,  i was truly disappointed about my experience last night. 

Let's start with what's good:
- nice ambiance
- tasty wings & many flavors

Two factors disappointed me last night. The chicken wing were incredible small and made a truly unenjoyable experience.  The fries are flacid despite asking them \"extra extra well done\" each time."}
{"text":"-Upgrade your fries if you want better tasting fries.
-Don't order the poutine unless you like cheddar cheese(yellow)
-Good service"}
{"text":"DINNER experience here they really tend to push for the Beer & Shots and looking at the price of my friend's bill for a pint of Rickard's Red, I can see why.

Soda Drinks service is still top notch as the refills get here before you know you will need it, however the initiate ARRIVAL took a bit longer than expected while the Alcoholic beverages came at a reasonable timeline.

Waiting 30-minutes for our seats was reasonable on a Hockey Night when Philly vs. Boston played but we almost FELT uncomfortable as we felt a bit pressured to get drinks that was not our intent."}
{"text":"A few years ago I would have gave this place a five. 

The chicken wing quality has dropped drastically: they buy the jumbo ones now that is full of collagen and are quite off-putting, I actually never go here any more unless I am forced to because it is someone's birthday and this is where they want to go (I just order from the Wild Wings down the street (they also deliver!))

The Beef Ribs look like they are from the Flinstones and are quite amazing if you are lucky enough to get meaty pieces

The wing sauce selection is amazing as always and have always been the main selling point

I always order wings plain with the sauces on the side, usually go with at least two others which means we order 6+ flavors and get to experience them all and do not have to deal with soggy wings if we place big orders

When with large groups we have ordered the 100 wings a few times and they are always cold by the time we get to the end so I would advise against that unless you are a party of 15 all eating the wings

Had a horrible experience a few years back with the manager (used to be server at Richmond Hill location) Ruby but after complaining to head office we were taken care of and that experience has not been factored into score

For you UFC fans you are going to have to find somewhere else as they refuse to show fights citing that they are positioned as a family restaurant

The best thing about this place has to be the scenery which is always very good"}
{"text":"Wings are always fantastic but it's a chain restaurant and when you want wing-galore all stars is what you hit up in Vaughan.
I've been here many, many times especially when I was back in high school 3 years ago. Service has been crap ever since and I went back tonight with some high school friends and it hasn't change much. 

Our server was nice this time, I'll give her that. But in the past we've been jipped on our bill twice (probably because we were a group of teens...still no excuse).

However wait times haven't changed. When you're seated it takes forever to get your order. It wasn't even busy tonight (a Sunday at 8pm) and yet we waited 45mins-hour to get our food and people who ordered after us still got their food first.

Foods great and when you're in Vaughan you don't have too many options so that's where you go when you want killer wings. Hope the service picks up some more."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Superbowl and I must say, the previous comments were on the money. 

I must have called the place 20 times between Friday and Sunday and they didn't answer the phone once. I just wanted to tell them that I didn't need such a large reservation any more.

Service is very friendly, but very slow, although I don't think I can fault the waitress for that because my drinks came out very fast, but the food did not. So I would have to place that on the kitchen. However.....It was superbowl and it was pretty busy in there so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

 I've been to other All Star wings and this one is not very good in terms of quality of the wings/flavors. I found that my wings were a little overcooked and dry and also I just didn't like the flavours as much as the Vaughan location. Although the Greek fries were very good. The \"Casear Does Texas\" was a little too tangy in my opinion and the \"Roasted Garlic\" was ok, but lacking flavor or salt or something. although I did try one of my friends \"Spicy BBQ\" wings and that was pretty good.

1 pound - Caesar does texas: 2.5
1 pound - Roasted Garlic: 3
Greek Fries: 5

PS. Don't fall for the upsell trap of the \"Beer Battered Fries\" that cost an extra $1.50. It's all a gimmick, they are just regular fries with barely any difference."}
{"text":"TIP:-Food isn't bad but the service is beyond horrible I went there a few weeks back had to literally beg the waitresses to serve us!"}
{"text":"Still one of my go to place for wings, I love the size of their wings, the perfect amount of sauce that coat the wings, and the dill dipping sauce! 

Came here on a Saturday night before it go busy, the booths have their own TV's, the atmosphere is perfecting for watching a game, it's especially exciting if it's a big important game like the playoffs! 

My favourite flavour is creole mustard, perfect amount of sauce on the wings, breaded wings.  

The service at this location is good, wings came out fast and water got filled once they were emptied."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday evening, during a Leafs game day, was only 15 minutes late for our reservation, due to traffic, but apparently they have given away our table.

When I came in, one of the staff wasn't able to greet me, as she was on the phone CALLING MY NUMBER (to follow up on the reservation), but I'm surprised I didn't get any notification on my phone, and guess what, she was actually calling the wrong number. The person who took my reservation details a few days before took down the wrong number. Great.

Anyways, I told her, I'm here now, 2 of us arrived first, and I was still waiting for my 3 other friends, but instead of taking us to our table, to at least order drinks, she told us to wait until a few of us have arrived before we get seated. 10 minutes passed (4 out of the 5 arrived) and we were STILL waiting at the lobby for a table, I had to come up and ask again for our table, and she said 2 minutes. WRONG. You have to lower your expectations here when waiting. 2 minutes were more like 10 minutes.

A party of 8 people who walked in after I arrived were seated FIRST before us, and I don't think they have a reservation. 

So after waiting a total of 20 minutes despite our \"reservation\" which I think they gave away, we were finally seated. At this point, I was already disappointed at them which ruined part of the evening for me. 

We ordered 1 lb of wings each, each serving comes with 10 wings, celery and dip. Price was $10.95 so it's a little bit on the pricey side. 

Food review: very tasty and really saucy! So food was good. A couple of my friends who ordered the hot variety of wings (5 star or more) said they have done something with the spice, in which they have increased the hotness of the wings, and they were REALLY HOT compared to other All-Star Wings locations.

It takes a while for the food to come, but there are TVs everywhere so they kinda keep you entertained while waiting. Drinks were served quickly as well.

Over all, service is disappointing, but food is good. Would probably go out and try Wegz which is only a minute away next time."}
{"text":"WINGS:   A-   I had wings here 3 times, and consistently they were good. The wings were small but very tasty.  Actually I hate those places with giant wings but so much fat on them, and can almost smell the hormones injected into the chicken.

FRIES:     C-   Second time we were there, we had the Greek fries and they were cold, and soggy and absolutely tasteless.  I regret putting up with them.  I should have called the waiting staff, complained, and ask them to make another batch that was fresh.  The second time I visited, the waitress hardly ever came around.  She ever brought wet naps, the bucket, or revisit the table for soda refills.

SERVING STAFF:   b-  ,  Like I said the first time I was there, the service was good (kinda), Second time - very  deficient.  The waitress never even brought the wing bucket, or wet naps.    Third time, we were served by waitress named Amber.  She brought us everything needed for wing eating experience, including extra wet naps.   She even gave us a promotional coupon for next visit.   I was served with so little attention on my second visit that I automatically only tipped 10% on my  third visit.  I did not notice until I left.  If I run into you again  Amber, you can expect a better tip  as anyone doing an excellent job needs to be properly rewarded.  

OVERALL GRADE:  B,   Why?   Wings here are great.  Actually cheese cakes here are great.  Fries have much  room to improve.    The wait staff experience - really depends on the luck of the draw.  If you  get a chance, ask for Amber.  She is profession, pleasant, and does what needs to be done to make customers feel like a king or a queen.  My wife was very happy with the service she received too from our third visit.     This place has a potential to be a A grade establishment with some needed attention in the right places.

I am a fan of this place despite some shortcoming. For now this is our husband & wife spot for Saturday nights.

We had another great night at this place tonight.  Raspberry cheese cake with white chocolate shaving really topped our meal.  Wait staff experience is improving.  Next time we may give another shot at the fries.   I love their wings!!!

{"text":"All Star Wings is where you want to come for your wing fix. Saucy, saucy, saucy wings can be had in your choice of over 100 different flavors. The sauces are categorized by heat level from no heat to Armageddon heat. They also have dry wings for those who don't like to get messy. The arahova fries were also good and rich in flavor. 
The d√©cor is a typical sports bar with TVs all over the place where you can catch a game and stuff your face with wings, ribs, burgers, and more.
The service was great considering we had a huge group. Our servers were very friendly and accommodating. Absolutely in love with the wings here!"}
{"text":"Best place in vaughan if you are looking for a good sports bar. Service is good and chicken wings with ranch flavour being my favourite. The rest diner is not that great. But environment, crowd are good."}
{"text":"This AllStar location may be the biggest, but it sure as hell is the sh*ttiest. Don't mind my language. The service my friends and I had yesterday was horrendous, I've worked in the restaurant business for a large portion of my life, I am now in the PR and graphic design industry. So I think I can say I have good understanding of custom service skills. 

I've been to all the AllStar locations and it's your topical sports bar where only women with larger breast work at. The food is average, they've got a large selection of flavours but quantity isn't always quality. I believe that food and service do go hand in hand but I'll be more lenient if the food was amazing. 

Let's start with the hostess, yesterday there were two sports games playing. But we had arrived at around 10 ish so they were about to end. It took the hostess to come and greet us 15 minutes. 15 minutes is pretty ridiculous and than she told us it'd be a 15-20 minute wait for a table of three. I needed to use the bathroom, so I walked in the restaurant and notice there were fcking empty tables everywhere, some booths, some tables. Finally the hostess sat us to a table, and we noticed that there was a booth. So we asked if we could switch, we asked three different people only to get an answer because we didn't request it we can't have it. Uh what? I thought you seat guest in the section of the server order and you always seat the best seats first... they ended up giving the table to a group of 3 males.

Anyways, food was fine not horrible. 

Next was the server. She asked us if we wanted to take our food home, and as I was still eating she took my plate to pack my food... what is it because I'm not a male I don't deserve proper service and respect? Either all this girls have never worked in a customer service industry before or they just don't care. 

Let's just say I'll probably never come back to this location. However the Markham and Richmond hill locations are never like this."}
{"text":"All Star wings is definitely the place to be when you want a variety of flavours for wings. I came here for my friends birthday on a Saturday night and of course it is busy especially during game nights. The Scarborough location is smaller than the other locations so there aren't as many tables and this place is a popular one in Scarborough. We waited for about an hour to get a table for a party of 15 because my friend didn't make reservations. Of course you order wings here and boy every time I come for wings, its always a tough choice because they have like 70 flavors of wings to choose from! I chose 1lb of maple thai breaded flavored wings and ordered a pitcher of Rickard's Red. The food came out relatively quickly. It comes with celery sticks and a dipping sauce. I thought the maple thai tasted great. It was just right with a little bit of kick to it. For dessert, I ordered the Godiva Double Chocolate Cheesecake and it was quite delicious and chocolatey. Not too sweet and very creamy. I am always a big fan of All Star wings so definitely a great place to watch sports and enjoy some wings!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a relaxed evening... Our server Trita was very polite and generous... We had a good experience along with a good blue Jays game."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! It's a great spot to hit for game night, whether it be with a date or a group. I've been here about 5 times now and every experience has been good. 

My usual order is a pound of wings with their Greek fries. They have a ton of flavours and I try different ones everytime. 

The best thing about this place is the booths they have. They all have their own TVs so it feels really comfortable and you can choose any channel to watch. 

Overall this place gets a 4/5 in my books. Good service, good food, and their booths make a great night for watching the game."}
{"text":"Not much more can be said other than what Saquib R. alluded to below. The wings here are absolutely the best in the GTA and any wing connoisseur would be hard-pressed to find anything better. The following a list a of why this restaurant tops every wing place I've tried in the GTA:

1. The size - the wings have meat on them and aren't like the dinky little baby wings you would receive at a box restaurant or from a frozen package.

2. The flavours - I can't count the number of times I've been to a wing establishment only to find out that their \"spicy\" is just Franks Red Hot or their sauces are just generic flavours. The menu here is so expansive that they do not explain what is in each flavour. However, the server will be more than happy to tell you what is in each one (don't be shy, they've been trained!). My personal favour is Prime Time (Suicide Sauce, Ranch and I believe a hit of Chipotle/BBQ). They have over a 100 combinations, so be adventurous! I'm not a fan of dry rub wings, so can't comment on that.

3. Mondays - on Monday's you receive a pound and a half for the price of a pound. Even better, you don't have to order a drink to receive the special.

4. Atmosphere - the place is decorated very well with an obvious sports theme. Jerseys hang the wall, but only where there is space in between the countless TVs. This is a prime spot to watch playoffs, UFC, and any other sporting event. Many booths have TVs in them as well. 

5. The mints - they have great mints.

This is the go to place for wings. Drop in on a Monday, ask the server to explain half the flavours to you, finally decide, enjoy the best wings you'll ever eat, rinse, and repeat next week."}
{"text":"I used to hit up Sneakers for my wings usually. But since the first time I came to All Stars it became my new go to place for wings. Fair prices, good service, and good food AND drink (the taps seem to have been blessed by the beer gods). So overall a place i'm always going to hit up for wings and a pint. Go here!"}
{"text":"We came here for take out . We bought wings , fries and chicken fingers . Service was so slow and they are not even busy. This place just opened up not long ago."}
{"text":"Huge selection of wings to a point that you will get confused what to order, over a 100 flavours! Both wings and ribs were really good, well cooked and tasty. I don't know if its common but they will give you a bucket to put your bones enit, which I thought was really neat. The environment is really loud (expected of sport bars), each seating area has tvs of its own. A very good wing experience, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I used come here for wings often, I would say my go to spot for wings. However the last time i ordered food it was horrible the meat tasted old and rotten. I couldnt even finish the lb i had. Not long after i had a stomach ache and was on the toilet. I definitely dont recommend coming here, would rather go to st.louis across the road. I repeat stay away from this place the kitchen dosnt care about the food they put out."}
{"text":"Tuesday night, restaurant is empty as you can see from my photo, and the service was as slow as molasses. We had to go get our server to order. Unfortunate really. 

Now to start on the menu! Oh dear. 200 options for wings but No explanations for the random named flavours lol. So if 200 flavours were not daunting enough add no real way to decide what to order other than trying to rely on your server to know what you do and do not like. Insert frustration lol. 

We had a few hiccups with our orders but the manager was awesome and he took them off our bill no questions asked and made sure to come over and check if we needed anything else. My friends chicken came raw and my salad was half wilted 

I will give his place another shot. Hopefully I'll be able to update my review with a better experience."}
{"text":"Trying to find a place for beer and wings, All Stars is the first place that comes to mind.
This was our first time coming here hence we didn't have any expectations.  At first I found the exterior quite strange, as its a walk just to the front entrance which faces the main street, hence parking is at the back.......
Location wise, this is a busy place, bar and dining areas are separate with plenty of sports memorabilia hanging all over the place.  Overall the interior decor is clean.
The service was pleasant.
In terms of wings selections our party if four chose, classic spicy buffalo, Bloody Caesar, Caesar takes Texas, and honey mustard...all among the popular choices as we weren't sure what to choose.  Hence some recommendations by our lovely server paid off.
Portion-wise there was plenty of food to go around, and to be safe in case there was a shortage, we ordered a side of heir popular Greek fries, not bad...just a lot of oregano was on the fries. 

Overall experience was a positive one. 
Service was awesome.
Food was great.
Atmosphere was warm and clean.
Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"We had a terrible server named Sara. We had a party of 8, and she refused to split our bills apart. She lied to us. She expected us to calculate our own separate bills. You can imagine us all bringing out our iPhones trying to figure out our amounts. Although we were happy with the service prior to this event, she made it very inconvenient for us. All just so she could add a 15% gratuity fee on our bill - I would've been happy to tip 15%, instead I'm an unsatisfied customer, and Sara just a lot of tips from our whole table"}
{"text":"Come here for the best wings. It is unfortunate they don't have any locations downtown, but it is well worth it to make it up north to this location.

My ranch is on fire
ceasar does texas
both are amazing wing flavors and both quite hot. 

Probably the best wings you will ever have and it is good value as well. for 2 pounds of large wings with a lot of sauce on them, it costs about 20 dollars.

The service on the tuesday night could have been better. In fact, I had one server walk past me a few times before even acknowledging us. At least offer us some water, they were clearly understaffed. 

The food did come out reasonably quick so that is why I am giving this place 4 stars, the server could have done a much better job but you can't get everything you want. I hope the management here will provide more staff for weekdays as you shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes to be acknowledged."}
{"text":"Guilty to say but we are regulars here... 

Our \"go to\" flavours:
- cheesy where's the beef - kind of like poutine but replace fries with chicken wings
- that's amore - caeser sauce with thai chilli sauce
- nero's epilogue - sweet and spicy but not unbearably so... must try if you like something with a tiny kick
- you pucker - maple syrup and lemon pepper (sounds weird but good!)
- scorched nuts - a little nutty flavour with hot sauce (maybe homicide?)
- mehican rancheros - tastes like tex mex dry rub with ranch sauce
- passage to bankok - tsatziki sauce with thai chilli sauce
- opa - dry rub (?) with feta cheese 

chicken used to be larger but it's still not dinky small like other wing joints which keeps us coming back.  Flavours are mostly good but the fact that the flavours have no descriptions is extremely annoying."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple of times and the food is good but the service is slow. The waitresses seem like they hate their job.

Last time i went the waitress recommended the all star ranch. We did not like it. We also got chipotle flavoured wings. They were terrible. We ordered hail cesare fries with beef and they put chili. We didnt like the taste of it so we asked the waitress if it would be possible to exchange the fries. She seemed very offended. Dont know why...we didnt accuse her of anything. Then we asked for our bill and she brought it with no mints( which we usually get with the bill but i guess we pissed her off). My friend paid and tipped her too. After the waitress left we realized she charged us an extra pound of wings so I went up to her and told her and her response was \"oh\" and hold on. She gave us cash back and did not apologize or even say a word. The way she just awkwardly stuck out her arms with the cash and dropped it in my friends hands without saying a word was enough for me to give this place two stars."}
{"text":"Prompt and attractive service. Food was served hot and wait time was very decent, especially on a football Sunday. Would definitely go again

Only issue I have is that they have a ton of flavours for the wings, and you don't get a clear explanation of what the flavour is per say.

But either way, food is good, drinks are cold, staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is positive."}
{"text":"Walks out to patio with hostess during Taste of Italy and this confusing scenario happens:

Me: (points to table for two) May we sit here?
Hostess: No, I can't seat you here
Me: Why?
Hostess: Each section is under a different server and I can't seat you here. Sorry, please sit in this area instead

Not even half a minute later, two people gets seated in the exact table I had requested for. Ten minutes later, a group of people were seated at the table beside the seat for two but they requested to move to another table in the area I got seated at.

This really baffled me so I spoke with a manager on duty and this was his response: it's possible that the server responsible for the area you wanted was not available at the time you came and just after you were seated, that server became available. 

The managers reasoning was understandable but it didn't make the original experience with the hostess any more pleasant. The only positive thing out of this visit here was that our server was wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here to get take out (for the first time at this location)
Took 50min for the kitchen to put out my simple order. (Only 20-30 guests in the restaurant, and about 70% of them were sitting at the bar just drinking). 

The wings were cheaply sauced (Why I loved AllStars because they used to \"drown\" them with the specialty sauces). Clearly they're trying to cut costs. What  a shame. They didn't even include the carrot/celery sticks. WTF? Wings also seemed smaller than I remember. 

Despite the food being of half the quality than it used to be, what was really disgusting was all the waitresses. Standing around, drinking and talking. And seeing one of the runners with a cup up next to here face and then putting it with the other cups to be served to the customers. Nasty. Its an open area. Who trained her, is beyond me. 

This establishment is a joke. Really surprised when I saw all the good reviews. 
On the bright side, I didn't give them a 1 star because I didn't get food poising. Other than that, avoid this All Stars."}
{"text":"Wow! The wings here are FANTASTIC! I am from the US where all we have is BWW and this place blows them out of the water! I enjoy their caesar drink, it's not the best i've ever had but it will do. I love their Wet & Wild and Desperado Wings. I didn't care for the Caesar does Texas wings, I felt it was too sweet. I love love love the Vesuvius, it's my new favorite! I wish that they had descriptions of their wings so you're not in the dark when ordering. Their dill dip is quite good, try it out if you haven't already. The waitstaff at this location is hit or miss. We sat in the dining room and felt the service was good, however the next time when in the bar area we had terrible service. Our server wasn't on top of it, she would just stand behind the bar and never check to see how we were at our booth inside the bar area. Regardless, the wings are so good I will be returning and not fast enough!"}
{"text":"I was in Scarborough for a client meeting, and having heard a lot of good things about Allstar Wings I decided to give it a shot.  Never having posted a review on Yelp before, I thought this one would be a good start as it's a new location.

I tried calling in upon leaving my meeting and was not able to get through.  Once I got there, it took about 30 minutes to be seated as it was quite busy and I chose not to sit on the bar side.

I also did inquire about the telephone (as it seems to be a common theme with the review previous to this), and one of the waitresses informed me that they have been having technical issues with the phone company and are not able to receive calls at the moment.

With that said, considering it's a new establishment (this location at least), hick ups are expected as in any business.  The food was delicious and the staff was great.  

I look forward to swinging by this location again when I'm in Scarborough next and hopefully their phones will be up by then. 

4 stars out of 5 for good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"favourite wing place has finally arrived in mississauga!

I remember the days travelling in traffic from Mississauga to Richmond Hill waiting close to 2 hours for a table to get a taste of those crispy and flavourful wings. Now it's 10 minutes away from my work and I don't have to wait for a table. 

Yes, no more 2 hour waits, doesn't that worry you about the place when you do not have to wait. Personally I would rather wait  for a table b/c it tells me so much more about a restaurant. But right now I'm going to enjoy not waiting for a table b/c it's only a matter of time before everyone else in Mississauga discovers what I know about this place and that they live up to the hype!

Compared to other wing places the wings are bigger, crispy and the mixture of ingredients is alot better. Most places I can easily destroy a pound of wings but here for some reason I always struggle but that just tells me I know I'm getting my money's worth.

They have over 100 different flavours of wings, all you have to do is ask the waitress what the ingredients are. if you really like spice try ARMAGEDDON, you're gonna have to sign a waiver form first though to try these wings. Good Luck!

Better try this place now before it becomes a 2 hour wait!. Mondays are 1 1/2 pounds of wings for the price of a pound.

Items to definitely get:

-Hail Caesar Fries (ceasar dressing and parmesan cheese)

Wings
- Nero Epilogue (ceasar dressing, medium sauce and parmesan cheese)
- Cheesy wheres the beef (gravy and cheese)
- pandoras box (honey garlic and medium sauce)
- cleopatra (honey garlic, mild sauce and parmesan cheese)
- god of thunder (been a while since I've ordered this but remember it being very good and spicy)
- hail caesar (caesar and garlic parmesan)
- Cajun dry"}
{"text":"All Stars Wings and Ribs is one of my favourite places for a go-to wings spot, however, I just went through my first experience at this Rutherford location, and I must say the service was absolutely shit. The wings were whatever, but the employees there always think they're right. It's as if their policy is the employees are always right. We had a problem with out bill; things weren't added correctly and there were one too many items we didn't order. At first, the manager (I think) who dealt with our issue seemed fine with dealing with it (sort of) but them after we realized there was another mistake, she simply said not to worry about it. Like seriously?? She also said the bills were a little expensive because of gratuities, but all stars never includes the gratuities in their bills (at least at the locations I've been too). She simply just wants to persuade us into thinking she's right, but she wasn't. This is a new location I believe, but a shitty one. All in all, the waitresses lack experience, the food was ok, and the ambience was different in a bad way considering the music they played. Don't come here, you may screw yourself over with their service. That lady didn't even give me my change back and still demanded she was right. This location puts a shame on the All Stars Franchise. Get new staff, please."}
{"text":"We heard about this establishment from a friend and decided to head out to Mississauga to try out the wings. With a name like AllStar Wings & Ribs, our expectations were rather high.

Forget about the lack of parking, as a few times around the block we managed to find a spot just down the street.

We went in and the first thing we noticed was the place was mostly empty and this was at 6 pm on Saturday.

The second thing we noticed was that it appeared to be a sports bar, but had club/dance music playing. Not bad music, just not what we expected in a sports bar.

It took a couple of minutes waiting at the front before someone came and took us to our table. We requested a booth instead and were reluctantly put in a booth beside the servers area near the kitchen.

We got our menus and immediately, the server wanted our drink order, but we had not even had a chance to see what was on the drink menu. We felt rushed as the server was waiting at our table until we decided. We ordered our drinks and the server wanted us to order our meal at this time. As I mentioned, we just sat down and had just started looking at the menu. We politely declined to order immediately as we like to have our first drink before our meal.

The server returned a few times while we were still enjoying our drinks and finally to make her go away we decided to order.

The menu has lots of wing sauce options, but the menu only had cryptic names with no description of what the sauce flavour actually was. We questioned our server about a few flavours and finally decided on 1.

It didn't take long for our meals to show up and the first thing I noticed was that my wings looked burned, with a few splashes of sauce on them. The wings looked like wings that I buy from Loblaw, frozen in a box that are heated in an oven. Since the wings were burned, I can only assume that these were heated/reheated in an oven to the point of burning them. The menu says deep fried, but perhaps they were deep fried at the beginning of the week and then reheated in an oven when needed.

I would not recommend AllStar Wings & Ribs for their wings. If I wanted reheated wings, I can do that at home for a fraction of the price we paid.

As I mentioned the first thing we noticed was the place was mostly empty and this was at 6 pm on Saturday. Perhaps I am not the only one who was unimpressed with the food!

All in all a very bad experience for a Wings Sports Bar."}
{"text":"The Greek fries are heaven. I come to this place nearly weekly and it's great. I've only had one bad experience and it was on a busy day. Most days this place is stellar service UNLIMITED SODA REFILLS and just great food all around. Like... I'm probably biased cause I GO HERE EVERY WEEK. EERY WEEK. Don't be rude and please tip if ya can man. None of that sting
HEAVEN"}
{"text":"Came here for wings, beer, and the sens/leafs game. Couldn't go wrong with all star. We had a group of 12, so we were placed in a room in the back. It was quiet, so we could still talk, but we could still watch and hear the game as well. The food was good, and since we had such a big group, we got 5 different flavors of wings. Was a big fan of the one with honey mustard and hot sauce. These are decent wings with a lot of batter. They have a ton of batter, so be prepared. 
Also, the heat wasn't that hot. Maybe we should have tried something higher, but the ones we got were pretty mild.
The service was great, and there was plenty of standard pub beers, nothing really unique. I wouldn't say these are the best wings in town, because I have definitely had better, but the options is what you come for. They have over 100 different flavors.

Not into wings? No problem. They have tons of different options even if you are not a wing enthusiast."}
{"text":"We went here today after a long day shopping @VM. It wasn't quiet dinner yet, so the place wasn't packed. The waitresses were super slow & not all there, @ first we had one training another one where she needed training herself, kept forgetting orders & details. Food ehhh definitely not a healthy choice, I heard s lot about this place but wasn't impressed at all, I've gotta be desperate to go bck, sorry guys!!!"}
{"text":"Wings were good. Nothing special, service was pretty bad, it took 25 mins to finally get a waiter to come see me. I wouldn't rush to come back that's for sure."}
{"text":"All Star is my home. Everything they have to offer is probably good but my recommendations are caesar does Texas, greek fries***********, honey garlic, and chipotle. I also love how they have such an impressively extensive menu."}
{"text":"You know how you have so many channels you can't figure out what to watch on TV?  Well, imagine that dilemma with chicken wings. So many delicious flavours I just can't decide. The restaurant is also great to watch a game with plenty of monitors and the beer selection is decent, but service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"Great selection of flavours with more seating area than some of the other top wing contenders.
Good deal on Mondays for pound and a half wings.
However there must probably will be a wait, particularly in large groups.
Great place to also catch popular games with friends."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time to try it out and it was a nice welcoming and I ordered wings and chill fries and I ask for mild fave when I got home they for got everything like it was honey fave and they don't put the dip sauce and vegetables the chill fries with too much meat and less fries , why !! So I will not be going there any more . 2/10"}
{"text":"This location can become really packed on Friday and Saturday evenings so it's important to go early to ensure a seat. If you're looking to watch a game, each booth has their own TV which can play any sports channel you're interested in, and for those tables that do not have personal TVs there are large screens hanging around the restaurant playing any current major game.

The service is quick and the waitresses have no problem answering any questions you may have about their menu, including describing and recommending flavours for the wings. From our own experiences on several occasions when we ordered a refillable beverage, our waitress always came around to see if it was almost empty and brought out a new drink even before we asked. Now that is great service!

When it comes to food, we usually order the same items every time: Caesar does Texas wings, Suicide or Hot wings, and Tex Mex Fries. With these three items, you really can't go wrong!

I have tried other items on their menu including their beef sliders which were quite bland, but I'd rather just stick to their wings and fries. If you're looking for a good chicken wing restaurant with a wide range of regular and unique flavours (including chocolate!), I highly recommend Allstar Wings & Ribs."}
{"text":"This place is way better than the location at Yonge and Elgin. Clean and well maintained. Excellent service. New Mexico heat, Caligula and Greek fries are my personal favourite. Add a Greek salad and you have your veggies quota for the day. Wont make you make so bad when you leave knowing you had your greens :)"}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you. Before sitting down, we asked the hostess, if they'd be playing the Leafs game with audio. She responded to us with yes. We sat down, ordered a pitcher, first period goes by. We asked again, we said, before being sat down let us know or we could go somewhere else. Just before the second period started, we were informed they won't be playing the audio. Excuse me? Basically wasted our time. We paid, tipped a penny, left to another bar and grill."}
{"text":"It's such a hassle to park underground and find which doors are open to get back into the parking lot! 

I had a horrible experience here recently! It took almost half an hour for my drink (if i didnt ask for it 3x) to be served and another 15 minutes for my wings to come out! On top of that it was difficult to catch the servers attention because she's chit chatting away with other customers and coworkers about her 'weight loss plan'. Girl no one gives a f...

It took so long to grab her attention so that I could pay for my bill and gtfo.

Their saucy wings are just swimming in the sauce. Very unappetizing. Their dry wings aren't even crunchy at all, it's soggy and very oily. The cooking temp should be adjusted and the meat to sauce ratio should be reviewed. 

Not coming here again. 

Worst place ever!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great, but I can't say the same for the service. The waitresses are rude and don't really care for their customers. 

During my most recent visit, our server brought us the wrong order twice and knocked a glass of water all over my phone without apologizing! Her only response only was: \"here's a napkin so you can clean that up\". How unprofessional.

I also overheard a few waitresses complaining about how customers don't tip enough, but I don't blame them when the service is this bad.

3 stars for consistency on the food; 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets if you like wings. There are a ton of flavours to choose from but I always get the desperado wings which is a 4 heat rating on their system.

Price is not cheap but you get what you pay for. It is always packed when any sports are on so sometimes the wait is up to 1 hour, so be prepared.

I've only ordered the wings and the burger here so I don't know about the other items. If you like wings though, this is the place to be. The Vaughan location is better than the new location in Mississauga I find."}
{"text":"Always good, come here for wings you won't regret it. Just be warned sometimes there is a wait time when the game is on."}
{"text":"Didnt like having all these types of wings and having to guess the best flavour
The wings i tried were great and my waitress was awesome. 
Loved having a tv at each table and having loud enough sound. 

Maybe i got lucky but the service and wings were great. Defintely will go back again"}
{"text":"I checked out AllStar Wings & Ribs on May 14th as it was the only thing around that wasn't a generic Jack Astors or Boston Pizza. I have been to their York region location years ago and I only had good memories so I had high hopes.

The food was a little above average. The wing flavour choices were overwhelming, but that's what you'd expect at a wing joint. The only issue I did have was the lack of attention the waitresses/waiters paid to customers. It wasn't quite busy at this point and it just seemed like a lot of the staff was huddling together having their own conversations. I had to get up and find a waiter so that I could ask for a refill of my drink. 

Would I go back? For the food, yes. I do prefer Wild Wing's garpar fries over AllStar's variation though.

4/5 for the food
2.5/5 for the staff
4/5 for the ambience"}
{"text":"Just came here last night and the wings are bomb! Here are a few comments I have to say about the place. 


Pros: 

- Parking: If you go late at night, there is usually tons of parking around. Unfortunately around prime time, the parking can be packed so you may have to walk further. 
- Food: Every time I've come here, the wings are always fresh, crispy and very saucy! 
- Price: Price isn't to bad. 13.45 for 1 pound! 


Cons: 

- Service: Service was okay, but disappointing because we were seated near the back. We kept waving down several servers and you can tell that they were avoiding eye contact with us because they were not their table. I was really disappointed with this service. It would have been nicer to acknowledge us and just get our server, but instead they avoided eye contact. 


Foods I recommended: 

- Cleopatra: Cheese and Honey Garlic type combination, really great if your looking for a combination of both 
- Wings Gone Wild: This is a medium level of spicy but you can go higher and higher if you choose too. This is a favourite of my partners and he loves it!  
- Pandora's Box: If you like Honey Garlic, this is a great variation. Has a sweet taste but a little of a different twist. Not spicy at all so recommend for kids or those who don't like spicy foods. 
- Greek Fries: Greek goodness! So good! It has a cheesy sauce on it but not to over bearing. Great appetizer to eat amongst friends. 

Go on a Monday, it will be packed but 1.5 lb pound of wings for 1 lb! Such a great deal, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"I have come to this location a few times now and I have had a mixed bag of experiences. On most of my experiences, they have been pretty okay and quite expecting of \"this type\" of restaurant. Having said that, I have had other experiences that have left me asking for more. 

Other than that, the food here isn't the greatest. I had the Traditional Burger and was surprised (not really) to find out they use frozen patties instead of fresh ones. Regardless, if you want a cheap eat and aren't looking for a top notch mean, this place would do you good. 

For drinks this place is pretty stellar, I have come here on a few occasions to enjoy a beer with a few friends and have been pleased with the \"quality\" of the beer (if that makes sense). I have had a few virgin drinks on occasion and those too are quite impressive to my surprise. 

All in all this place is definitely a decent place to check out if you're ever looking for a nice cold one."}
{"text":"This may not be the best spot to eat, but if you're looking to watch a game with some friends this is the spot! 

The food is pretty mediocre. We ordered the Greek fries & the Hail Caesar fries (which in this instance came with honey garlic sauce). The Greek fries were covered in a ranch like sauce with what seemed to be oregano and paprika on top. I feel as if the fries become heavy after the first couple of bites & it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The fries were crispy, but soggy close to the middle of the bunch. They also lacked salt on the fries that didn't have any topping. 

The Hail Caesar fries came with honey garlic and ranch sauce, with fries that were more similar to wedges. This one had an overwhelming honey garlic taste & basically tasted like eating a honey garlic chicken wing. The coating of the sauce was thick, but once again had enough after a couple of bites. 

Overall the food & prices aren't that bad, but just not that great either."}
{"text":"On Thursday, I was celebrating my 4th Year Work Anniversary with my old colleague Julian and decided to have our party here.  I called to make reservations for 15 at 5:30 PM during the middle of the day.  The person on the line let me know she checked with her manager and they would be able to accommodate us.

Arriving about 10 minutes late to the reservation, our tables were set accordingly.  It turned out that we had to add another table as 2 more people showed up to equal 17.  Anika was our server and she did such an outstanding job with our party.  She was around, she checked up on us frequently and had a good nature about her.  Anika did her job right and with pride.  Separate bills were not a hassle for her.  She was organized and you did not see her sweat about anything.

I ordered the Snake Bite flavour of the pound of wings.  I know I am a fan of Wild Wing, so I had to get this to compare.  3 fires, 3 stars.  It was pretty good but not a spellbound taste to the wings.  The were good and that's it.

It was a great time and I was glad and appreciative that this place accommodated us and gave us good service for the amount of people.  They charged us an immediate 15% gratuity which was expected.  It was circled on the receipt so we did not miss it.  Kudos to this place!  I was very impressed and hopefully will be back in the future.  Anika, if you ever read this, you were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an \"off\" day but I went to eat here and had positive expectations from the reviews here. But I was disappointed. 

Saturday afternoon should have more than 1 server, 1 host and a manager running around the restaurant. It took awhile for anyone to notice us and get seated. 

Server was friendly but looked overwhelmed because she had many tables. She didn't come by to check our meals until much later. I ordered the Thunder & Lightning sandwich which I asked to add cheese and gravy with the fries. It never came, I got regular fries and so I had to wait until she came back. It took SO long that I finished my sandwich and most of my drink before the manager brought over a regular sized fries with gravy and cheese. It was a nice gesture but it was lunch and it was definitely too much. I also asked for sauce and she never brought it, I had to ask the manager. 

My friend also mentioned the wings she had was just OK not amazing. She preferred the wings from St Louis. So would we come back? Definitely not. Sorry the service and sub par food was not that great."}
{"text":"Classic wing joint, girl at the door did a great job of seating and being super welcoming!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I thought AllStar Wings was any good.

But the wings at this location is pretty good, even if the staff can be somewhat vague as to what is in some of the recipes, like what makes up Mexican spices. Despite this, the service is here is pretty decent in the sense that the servers are able to put some recommendations as to what to order and it turned out quite well.

The place isn't too big, but the line up is a sight better than going to Grazie or else where, so if I didn't feel like a long wait and Italian food, this would be a great option for a casual place.

They have a good size waiting area, and their booths are big enough to accommodate a baby car seat, although I would recommend stowing the stroller back in the car, once you are seated.

Atmosphere is typical for a wing place and they have a ton of screens to watch any sports action that you want to."}
{"text":"I go to this place regularly. When you can't think of anything but wanna have a good time with great food, awesome service and super value. This is the place. We go hear in groups or just the 2 of us. Everyone we love this place 
Top favorites wings gone wild, spicy plum,  Greek Texan,  Pandora box. Other great items to try are the  crab cakes, pulled pork sandwich, tilapia sandwich, beer batter fries and to end with the best dulce de lech cheese cake. Have fun"}
{"text":"All Star's is hands down the best wings place I've ever been to.

They offer a huge amount of flavors to try. I had the Hot ranched Asian. Which was hot sauce, plum sauce and ranch. It was amazing and to top it off the size of the wings are huge. I also got the greek fries which were a nice compliment to the wings.

Overall I am very satisfied with the service and quality of the food. I wish they had a location in the downtown toronto area."}
{"text":"I went late Friday night and it was busy. We waited 10-20 minutes for our table which was fine since that's what the hostess had told us (20 minute wait). 

I might have gone in with too high an expectation because I've only tried it two other times at other locations and it was good from what I remembered. This time was not the same. We ordered 2 single orders of wings and a Nathan's hot dog. The hot dog was disappointing...it didn't taste like a Nathan's or maybe they didn't do a good job making it - tasted like it was boiled. :( The fries were good.

I wanted the wings with buffalo sauce and ranch on top but the server said they didn't have any so I opted for My Ranch is on Fire and in the original style. I did not like it this time. I found the breading way too thick and oily and the whole thing was just sickening. I prefer wings from St. Louis over these. I hope this was an isolated situation and other locations will be better."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the wings of coarse. So many flavours to choose from. Great sports bar atmosphere. I sat at the bar and she was very professional and catered to all of our needs. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The wings are excellent but there is something strange about the customer service the waitress has some kind of an attitude and seemed very impatient because my mom was taking her time looking through the menu. The resteraunt is still.packed as always friday nights if they can improve their customer service a little bit I'm am sure people will be more satistsifed and enjoy their dining experience at all stars and so many flavors of wings to choose from"}
{"text":"We went there like 4 of them and in that one of my friend drink 1 beer out side when we sat on the table. The bar tender even doesn't know who drunk and she was so rude that she don't wanna serve any alcohol and more over she dnt even wanna offer any food to have, and I was not even drunk...this is so bad service I never see"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and the food was amazing! 

You have to HAVE to try the Greek fries. We got a few varieties of wings and they were all delicious. Pandora's Box though will always be a favorite!"}
{"text":"My favourite wing flavour here is all thai'd up with a side of blue cheese and celery. Their Greek fries are also delicious. Other yummy flavours include caeser does Texas, American, cheesy where's the beef, pandora box, and a few others."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly impressed. Lots of flat screen TVs so good for sports watching. I had the Nathan's hot-dog. The dog was actually tasty but not a fan of the fries here. The desert was okay but overall this is a better place to chill at night. It seems to have a good bar selection and did I mention LOTS of TVs?"}
{"text":"I recently came here with my boyfriend because we were both craving wings. I was so hungry I just ordered something I knew they had for sure - unbreaded honey garlic wings. My boyfriend came here recently so he knew what to order - breaded Caesar does Texas wings. It was a total regret once we got our food - I wish I went through the menu more carefully!

The honey garlic wings were alright but the real star of the show was definitely Caesar does Texas. It's a combination of Caesar and chipotle sauce topped with Parmesan cheese. Man oh man was it good! I definitely recommend this flavour if you've never tried it before.

We also had a lovely waitress (her name is Levana). She was super friendly and was very attentive. Try to sit in her section if you come to this location!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. The service used to be friendly & fast, but lately the service has gotten worse. 

My friend and I came here a couple nights ago for some wings. There was a 20 minute wait, which isn't bad, so we gave our names & requested a booth. 30 minutes pass by and the hostess tells us she has a high top table in the lounge available. We were too hungry to turn the table down. 

The hostess never brought us menus to the table. Our server comes by and asks if we're ready to order, I tell her no as we haven't gotten menus yet. She asks if we want a drink and we say water. 15 minutes pass by and she comes back with the water. We ask for menus, and she says \"oh you want menus?\" then goes to get us menus .. what were we supposed to order from, did they expect us to share menus with the table beside us? We weren't brought menus and the table didn't have a drink menu. I didn't know guests were supposed to ask for menus ..

Despite the crappy service, All Star wings will always be my favourite. I always get breaded cleopatra wings (honey garlic sauce + Caesar & Parmesan sauce) with ranch as the side dipping sauce. If you aren't into saucy wings, these aren't the ones for you. 
My friend also ordered cleopatra wings, however she got Greek fries on the side. The server suggested she upgrade to beer battered fries ($2 more). I don't recommend it. Stick to regular fries."}
{"text":"Really had a good time here tonight.
  The server Nicole was a major factor.  She made positive menu suggestions, and kept our bottomless soft drinks full.   She explained many Wing flavors and was genuinely happy.   Our food came promptly, and server passed by often to see we were alright.
    only comment;  calamari appetizer was not great.  (pass on that next time)
     Prices reasonable too."}
{"text":"Customer service here isnt the best and i do not reccomend ordering takeout. I usually love eating here, their wings are my favourite until today i ordered takeout for the first time and the wings were not fresh, they had an unusual taste that is usually attributed to wings that may have been left out too long or werent the freshest. Im not sure if its because i ordered takeout or if its an off day but it was not good. I called to complain instead of immediately writing a review but i was not taken seriously. I was told the wings come in fresh every day, despite explaining myself, i come here often enough to know what all stars fresh wings taste like, and these were not the quality i normally receive. She asked the kitchen and i got the same reply, \"the wings are fresh. Sorry.\".. ok.. alrighty then... thanks for resolving my issue? I paid for this meal expecting my usual satisfaction and overall came out of it with a bad taste in my mouth. Literally and figuratively,  thanks to the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Can I give it a zero?
Service was okay but the frozen food was gross. Ridiculous music playing in the background adds to the total unpleasant dining experience.
Philly Steak Sandwich was the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"really a great place
have been here MANY times and i always love it 
the service is great
the atmosphere is young and more \"sports-bar\"ish 
i recommend the Greek fries - YUMMY!
definately some beer
and in terms of wings, nero's epilogue (ceasar and spicy goodness)
This is Sparta! (BBQ wings SMOTHERED in tzatsiki
and Pandora's Box - like honey garlic but tastier
also \"cheesy where's the beef?\" - poutine on top of wings 
avoid Kama Sutra :P

but really a great place
GREAT wings and fries and a GREAT atmosphere
definately prefer this to Duffs"}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could give this place more stars but every time I come here, the service always disappoints. There is never a hostess so I end up waiting a while just to be seated (all the time). The other day, the server at the bar saw my friends and I waiting but didn't even bother telling one of her coworkers that there were customers. Then when we finally got approached, the 'hostess' didn't even say \"hi\" or \"welcome\" and just immediately took the menus and expected us to follow her. Now our ACTUAL server (the one who took care of our table) was a little more attentive. I would say though, she did seem like she hated her job. My friends and I honestly felt uncomfortable because she never smiled and it felt like we were burdening her with our orders however, she did check up on us every now and then. I'm pretty sure one of the managers brought out our food (she wasn't wearing uniform) and again, no greets or anything. She came to our table and right away, \"cleopatra\" \"greek fries\" and handed us our food and left. Not even \"Is there anything else we can get for you guys?\", she just legit disappeared. There were probably 5 girls working and all of them passing our table but not one noticed that we needed assistance (even when we made eye contact and gave the impression we needed something). 

Luckily, we liked our food so above all the disappointing encounters we had with their staff, the food was one thing that kept us satisfied. I would also mention, not to order any of their desserts. The cheesecakes are good, but $6 for one slice and the slice is incredibly small. They came out with huge dessert plates and had us thinking the portions were going to be great. But as soon as they were placed in front of us we looked at each other like \"that's it? where's the rest?\". I like All Stars but I would probably drive further out just to receive better service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The restaurant was clean and spacious. The workers were amazing. The food was amazing. The best wings I had in years. I highly recommend this Canadian joint."}
{"text":"This is my go-to wings place. I've tried Fanzone, various Wild Wing locations and Buffalo Wild Wings and I have to place AllStar at the top for me.

Firstly, the major problem everyone has is that their 150 flavours don't describe what they actually are, aside from the name so here you go http://allstarwingflavours.squarespace.com/. That website lists them all and their descriptions.

From what I can tell they have 6-7 major flavour sauces, and the rest of the wings are just combinations of those, sometimes with something extra like cheese, peanut sauce, etc. My favourite is Vesuvius (Garlic sauce, Homicide sauce, and parmesian cheese) they are lower heat variations of the same flavour (Nero's Epilogue, Hail Caesar, Crazy Italian), but I feel like the garlic sauce and Parmesan cheese dilute the heat, and their homicide has a nice roasted pepper taste to it. Other flavours I'd recommend on a first try are Cheesy Where's the Beef and Piza Piza.

In terms of service I've never had any problems with speed or ease of ordering, or even quality of food, but I've never gone during peak hours too. They space is pretty well sized and they can accommodate numbers. The waitresses have also always been polite and constantly check on you."}
{"text":"When we first got here we waited 15 minutes for someone to come up to the front and seat us.  Once we got seated one of the servers came up to us and served us our drinks since the girl that is supposed to be our server was on break. 


Once we got our food (wings and sweet potato fries) they only gave us one of the dipping sauces and not the other which is $1.00 extra for.

Well we never knew who our server was.. The margarita tasted like garbage and not worth the $7.25 that she charged (basically mixer and ice in a cup).  One person asked us how was everything before we even ate anything. Our water cups were empty for 20 minutes and didn't know who to ask for water since we didn't know who our server was.  Our drinks were barely touched because it was disgusting and sour.

Just disappointed with the service here.  The sweet potato fries unseasoned (per request) was delicious and crispy.  The wings were cute and as small as the wet naps given to us.  We asked the server who took our order what sauce she would recommend for something with more garlic flavors and she responded with \"Caesar does Texas.\"  A bit disappointed with his sauce because it was more sweet with chipotle sauce and you couldn't even taste the garlic nor Parmesan on top of it.

I just wouldn't recommend this place unless you're someone who just wants to people watch or to chat with pretty servers."}
{"text":"This place has very slow service. Make sure you have enough time to wait for your food. Fries were so little :("}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Always so lively with nice waitresses. The wait time for the dining room usually isn't too long and the wings are always good. 

There's just too many flavours with no descriptions. It can be a bit overwhelming; but the waitresses are always very helpful. 

They have a new cleopatra fries and it is AMAZING! I usually get the Greek fries and cleopatra wings. But the beer battered cleopatra fries were sooo good and perfectly crispy. 

A very fun place to go watch a game and you can request for them to show something else on each table's tv."}
{"text":"Family night out. We have a love for wings and decided to try this place based on the reviews. Amazing wing selection! We all had different flavours and they were all awesome. We will certainly be back...very soon!"}
{"text":"Other then the flavour of the wings the actually size and taste of the chicken has gone down hill at this location. It has been a while since I've been here and I was disappointed to see the quality of the wing go down. They are known for their wings so they should serve tasty and meaty chicken. 
Unless I'm craving wings, I won't be back anytime soon. 

I will add that all the girls that work here are friendly and personable. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"Like sports bars? I sure do... Like chicken wings? Uhun, yup... Like to be served a pound of bones to chew on...HUH? Say whaaaaat??? Oh helllllz no! This AllStar Wings location has so much promise yet is so far from the mark when it comes to making chicken wings.  The 2nd star is for Maria and her teammates at the bar.  Y'all are amazing!  I'll come back to say hi but kindly get the owner to order from a new chicken wing supplier because giving me more wings just because they're smaller just means more bones.  Your consumers want more meat!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pound of wings to share with my friend and the fries were mostly brown and crispy. The wings were dry and the sauce was tacky. When I went home I developed itchy red eye lids and redness on my face, I think the restaurant used really bad oil in their cooking for me to get such a bad reaction.. Would not return again."}
{"text":"Their wings are good and the place has a nice sports bar atmosphere. The servers are nice and attentive and the food is good too. Love the variety"}
{"text":"We have been twice and will be back. The hundreds of wing flavors is a little ridiculous, and annoying. Honestly how can you choose with obscure titles like \"this is Sparta\" and \"wild-on\"? But our wings came out perfectly cooked, breaded evenly, and the sauces are delicious. If they can actually deliver that many sauces, props to them. The fries are soft, which works well. Very good fries.  You get your own tv if you sit in a booth."}
{"text":"Besides the teens walking around as if they just got done at their seconds jobs on the street corners outside. It wasn't overall that bad. Me and a buddy went in waited about 10-15 for a table. Which it was busy as all living H$#%. But no complaints there. We hadn't got any food just some drinks and chatted. But from the reviews I see guess I got lucky not to eat anything. Biggest issue is this a family bar or a playground where ages 5-7 can run around with drunk adults all about. This a hazard waiting to happen. Would visit again if I just wanted a drink and a view."}
{"text":"The food quality is the same as all the other locations , but the service is horrible !! They have so much attitude when you are trying to change something about your order , and they keep saying well that's gonna be extra when you are removing stuff !! Then when you say you don't want anything extra they are like Oo ok nvm !! 
Be very clear on how you order cause they always mess up !!"}
{"text":"My top choice to to go for wings, not only because it's near my place, but it's also amazing and has many different flavours. They have the right flavours for everyone so don't you worry.

My favourites are: 
- Me Love You Long Time
- Hot Buddha 

I always order these 2 flavours when I'm there. They are spicy, saucy, and flavourful! I also tried the Beef Beefeater Rings, which were very cheesy. Not bad but not my favourite. 
The service was okay but this place is always busy so...I have no complaints. The waitress may disappear on you so get ready for it. 

Wings are always good with beers, but AllStar has some great cocktails. I tried their Margarita and it was marvellous!! 

You may want to make reservation in case if it's busy. I once had to wait 20 - 30 minutes to get a table. 

Pricing is reasonable for wings. The atmosphere is nice and kid-friendly. It's a good place to watch a game, munch on wings and sip on beers or cocktails. Each booth will have a small tv so it's easier to catch a game. They also have big screen TVs. The service is hit and miss but I have never been disappointed with AllStar."}
{"text":"Appalling service and forgettable food.

Came recently on a Thursday night with a large group to celebrate a birthday. We had made a reservation, but the hostess and the manager refused to seat us until \"at least 75% of the group is present\". The restaurant was half-empty! So instead of being seated and having us start buying drinks and apps, 5 of us had to crowd in the waiting area until the others arrived.

Eventually we were seated, but service was lacking. We had to flag down the server for cutlery, water, and pop refills throughout the meal.

The food was below average, even compared to most other chain wing joints. 

We also had 15% gratuity automatically added to our bill, but the server conveniently didn't mention it to us."}
{"text":"Pandora box flavor is great. Not too hot or spicy so it's perfect that makes you want to keep eating and ordering more. What's better than having wings while watching sports and having a drink with it? Cajun dry rub is great too. Won't be a disappointment!"}
{"text":"It isn't the usual type of place I would go to. But it isn't always good to be a creature of habit. I have to say the place exceeded my expectations. Much better than the previous restaurant. I thought the decor looked pretty decent.  Loved all the TVs in house. The service was excellent tonight. Portions were good. My salad was good and the wings were good. It also looked like they carried some of the Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes there (didn't dare go down that road). Hubby had a burger and enjoyed it. We would likely go back. Monday night they have a wing promotion as well if you want to try their wings."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! 
Their burgers are AMAZIIIIIIINNNG... their customer service is also great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible and disappointed... All stars has generally been a good place to eat.. This location in particular is disappointing.
1 parking is a hassle have to pay for parking only validate it after... Too much of a hassle
2 susposed to be a sports bar.. You walk in there and instead of playing tfc plays offs or hockey there Loud music blasting is this a club of sports bar??
3 wings disgusting like boiled pink and slimy
4 beer flat
5 staff no where to be seen even though place is empty
6 its dark inside no lights are on..
I almost tripped on the staircase walking to the bathroom. I should have brought my flashlight

Close down already open a second cup or Starbucks in this location.. Sad excuse for a sports bar"}
{"text":"Service is nice, but sometimes a long wait to get in. Most of the time waiters do great jobs, sometimes they don't. My favourites are Caesar Does Texas, Nero's Epilogue, and sometimes Pandora'a Box. Best to go on Mondays! I also love the Ten Buck Fry, it's really tasty and worth it!"}
{"text":"This is such a good restaurant, highly recommend. I was unsure about it at first as I haven't heard a lot about it before but, have always seen it. The staff was really nice with prompt service. My burger was delicious. Though not all of my parties food looked appetizing it was scrumptious. Definitely learned to to judge based on looks. Will be returning to in the future."}
{"text":"All stars is probably the best place you could go to for wings... Theyre just delicious period. 

So many different flavours to choose from and their Greek fries are just amazing.  I like to work in reverse. Wings first, apps later. That way you can gauge better. One time I ordered way too many wings after I ate an app and well....lets just say I had a large midnight snack. 

KTHXBYE"}
{"text":"Great for wings, obviously! A single is almost two pounds of wings since they give you 10 HUGE pieces. There are TVs everywhere and the guests at this location get pretty into sports which makes the atmosphere really loud and fun. Service is usually not bad, however the most recent experience I had, I was not greeted at the door or given a table for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Good wings, an OK sports bar. If we have an important sports event we will go to Wegz across the road (much better sports bar but bad bad food and service), but if we want to hang out, eat some wings and have sports in the background  it will be the place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and while I am not usually a fan of 'franchise concept restaurants' I can say this place has an amazing selection of wings and beers. Just a great place to watch a game, catch up with some friends, and have some of the best wings that are served this side of Buffalo. Not only do they have what appears to be hundreds of different wing choices, you can also have them baked, fried, breaded, or dry seasoned. This place is always busy but the service is great and wait times are not too long. If you are craving wings, you have to go here."}
{"text":"The location itself was great, big screen TV's all over the place, and at the individual tables, nice and modern inside.

Washrooms were modern. 


I do not consider myself a wing expert but i have been the usual places like Wild Wing (various locations), Duffs (Both Locations), WheaShief, Arizona, hooters etc.


We ordered the following for starters:
Greek Salad, Greek Potato Skins, and Fries.
Mains:
Mediterranean salad (one non wing eater in the group)
Single order of Medium Flavour
Single order of Piza Piza 
Single order of Lord of Thunder


Reviews:
Fries:  Fresh cut, good size, not Greasy.

The Greek Spuds looked nice, a lil greasy looking, but apparently tasted great.

Med salad was an order of grilled veggies which looked very nice and reportedly tasted very nice.

Wings:
Piza Piza: Looked pretty cool with meted cheese on them, i tried one and it tasted ok.
Medium: Sauce tasted nice with a hint of spice.
Lord of Thunder: Hot sauce with creamy Greek slathered on it. The taste was good, it didn't really win me over like many of the reviews online said it would.

That being said my main complaint was not flavour it was the quality of the wings themselves. I honestly didn't find them any larger then Wild Wing. My wife actually stated that the quality of her wings were terrible and felt over fried.

All in all i don't think i would return, unless i was at Vaughan Mills and wanted wings.

I certainly wouldn't make a trip out to have the wings at All star like i would have Duffs that's for certain."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place to watch sporting events. There are multiple large televisions with a good sound system that ensures you catch the whole game without having to strain our voices. 

I've never really heard much about the food here but thought that I would try their wings and some appetizers. I got a Double of their most popular flavour, Nero's Epilogue. Its a creamier dressing with cheese on top. Although it was rated as a Hot flavour, its quite mild. The sauce itself is delicious and I had to resist ordering another two pounds. I didn't even have time to snap a picture because I was lost in the wings! 

I followed up this order with a side of the All Star Nachos which came out rather quickly. They are pretty standard nachos and I had no complaints other than the portion size. 

All in all, I would definitely visit this restaurant again whether or not there is an NBA finals game to watch. The food is good, the restaurant is spacious, and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Come here pretty often, great place to watch the game or just meet up with friends. Mondays are packed because of there wing special (buy a pound, get a pound and a half). Could never go wrong with ordering Wings: Cesar does Texas & beer battered Greek fries. Love coming here but service can be bad sometimes"}
{"text":"I love their bloody ceasar breaded wings and beer. I have been going here for a few years now and I love it. I have had other allstar locations, but theirs tastes so much better for some reason.

Atmosphere is better than other allstar locations (at least to me) and I enjoy going there for parties or a chill. Ladies are stunning (if you're reading this, hi!), and close to STC. 

Definitely a go to place for me :D"}
{"text":"Meeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh, I will come here to eat if I feel for my bloody ceasar wings. I find that is does not taste amazing, and I know the quality can be much much better.

Location feels pretty drab, and the star were not super kind/helpful. They were more like a *sit down and eat* feeling. Other allstars you feel like a place to relax, chat and you get smile; at least smile at me when I'm ordering, I'm not flirting, its just good customer service!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends of mine for the first time. I was blown away by all the flavours - All Star has over 200! We ordered a flavour each and a couple of beers. 

I tried:
Maple Thai - I liked this quite a bit! It was decently crunchy, and the sauce was sweet and a tiny bit spicy. 
Bloody Caesar - I thought this tasted pretty damn good... for the first couple of wings. After that, the creaminess got to be too much, so I'd recommend ordering this if you plan on sharing with other people.

Overall, I had a good time. I'd definitely go more often if it wasn't so far!"}
{"text":"Love the wings.  Service is a little slow and we came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was completely dead. They have so many wing flavour options which is great! The only downfall, they do not tell you what is in the flavours. They have flavour names like \"Homicide\" like what is in that? So if you want to know what's in all the flavours you have to literally ask the waitress as they have the booklet of all flavour the descriptions. Very annoying and time consuming. Other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Worst sports bar ever. Atmosphere is the best of it but the food and bad is terrible. Came here with a few friends and ordered a glass of white wine. Probably the worst decision. The first gods was okay. Tate's kind of old. The next glass they mixed the wines. Didn't taste remotely the same. Guess they were trying to finish off two bottles. The server kept calling me Hun and sweety- not very professional. The food was cold when it came out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews. 
Great bar and tons of tvs for sports events. 

Came here last week for a quick bite with my boyfriend. We live close so it's very convenient for us to pop in. 
Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, asked all the questions to make sure we were fully happy with our order. 
The food was ok. My boyfriend ordered the Thai homet wings which were delicious along side Caesar fries. She recommended them battered and we couldn't get enough. 
The Blt with salad I ordered wasn't the best. A dull big bun with almost not toppings. So blah. The Caesar salad was soaked, I mean DRENCHED with dressing. Couldn't even eat it. But we still enjoyed the overall experience. 

Today we came to watch the leafs game with some friends but had the opposite experience. We ordered some wings; Thai, plum hot and another (I don't remember). The honey plum were ok. Hot but no plum flavour. When we asked for plum it was an extra charge. The Thai were pretty spicy but tasted. And the others were ok as well. 
Onion rings were great fresh and hot. And our fries were ok as well. 

Our service however was mediocre. Our server didn't make many recommendations when asked. We were never asked if we wanted our fries battered as last time or our wings breaded. It slipped our minds to ask until it was too late. When asking for other dipping sauces she told us it was extra and people 'usually order ranch' so she gave us ranch. 

We will probably give this place another try just because it is so close to proximity to our home, however we are hoping for some more consistency."}
{"text":"Ordered 3lb takeout wings with 2 flavors (Cajun & Blue Honey) for extra $2. Total came up to approximately $38. 

The wings were very delicious for sure. However they didn't give us veggie sticks like other wing chains. The cajun one was really spicy and the blue honey is kinda sweet and creamy. 

In terms of service, I went on Sat night so it was busy. We ordered and picked up later. When we picked up, we waited around 10 minutes and no one greeted us until the manager (I think) came up and asked. She then got our order. Service might need some improvements. 

Overall, I give 3 stars for my experience. I will come back next time to try other flavors."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with my girl friend and I was left with a positive experience everytime. 

So far, this is the best place for wings! Try the Pandora Box if you haven't! (One of my favs). There's a run-on list of flavours to choose from, an attentive staff and there's a TV at every booth! 

You have the choice of having your wings breaded or unbreaded. My girl and I always order them unbreaded so we can enjoy the taste of wings rather than a mouthful of batter. But hey, if you like your wings extra crunchy then go for the breaded! 

Their appetizers taste pretty much as how it sounds. Nothing really special compared to the other appetizers you would get at other wing/sport bars.  However, it was still pretty enjoyable! 

Overall, wings were amazing and service was exceptional. I would be a regular customer if it wasn't so far!  Nevertheless, I recommend!!"}
{"text":"All stars does provide a large number of flavours and has good wings but this location is horrible. Slow service to sometimes no service. I think because staff automatically get gratuities for parties more than 6 they care less. I would go to fan zone down the street or another All Stars location"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for wings! I absolutely love it here. They have a ton of flavors, and offer other things if you're not really up for wings.

My fave so far is Hot-senorita! It is really good if you love hot wings. I've tried Baja bbq, Pandora's box, and chipotle, and they're also really good.

Downside is that the wing flavors are listed as only names, and no description of what they are. Luckily I found a website online: http://allstarwingflavours.squarespace.com. Hopefully this helps!

I also don't like how the wings do not come with fries already, but at least they're not too expensive to add on (~$5 for one order)!"}
{"text":"It really pains me to write a dissatisfactory review on such a recommended restaurant, but I truly did not enjoy my experience at All Star Wings & Ribs. To further justify my rating, I will decompose my review into the following 3 categories: service, quality, and value.

Service: My party of 6 guests (myself included) were seated at the back room, which was separate from the main dining section. While the peacefulness of dining in a relatively more private area of the restaurant was much appreciated, the infrequency at which we were attended to could not be overlooked. On top of our dishes taking almost an hour to arrive, we were told twice in the midst of our wait that the waitress was going to \"check up on our orders\". Unfortunately, we were never updated at either time.

Quality: I ordered 1lb of Nero's Epilogue (buffalo-style hot sauce, ranch, and parmesan cheese) and shared the Tex Mex Fries (cheese, seasoning, tomato, sour cream, salsa, shallots) - both are depicted in the gallery. I expected a decent level of spiciness from the wings considering the 4-flame rating. Sadly, the ratio of ranch to hot sauce was so high that it effectively eliminated all of the potential heat. In fact, I didn't even need to use the side serving of blue cheese. On the other hand, the fries were also a big disappointment as they were overly oily and not crispy at all. I can attribute this to two possible scenarios: 1. They were simply undercooked, or 2. The temperature of the fryer oil was not high enough, thus causing the the fries to absorb a significant amount of the oil, leaving them incapable of crisping up.

Value: With a 1lb order of wings costing $10.95, this restaurant is priced fairly competitively relative to its industry peers (ex. Wild Wings, Kelsey's, Wingporium, etc.). However, when factoring in the excessively long wait time, lacklustre quality of the food, and overall negative vibe, I did not feel as if my money was well spent.

I plan to return sometime in the future in hopes of a better experience, and will definitely alter my rating if that occurs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome wings with so many different flavours, though they don't have descriptions of the flavours on their menu. Pricing is average for wings but it's so worth it. The service fluctuates, so its better to ask for a pitcher of water and extra napkins before the waitress disappears on you.

My favourites are:
-wings gone wild (honey mustard and hot sauce)
-honey garlic
-cheezy where's the beef (gravy and cheddar)
-piza piza (Italian seasoning and mozarella)

Others:
-scorpian kiss (honey mustard and homocide)"}
{"text":"I have been to this fantastic restaurant many times now and each time we have gotten great service and awesome food. The staff are attentive and the tvs around make it so that you can always see the game (s) that are on. We have even been with a large group and the quality of our night did not suffer. We will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and huge wings. Service is not that efficient or great."}
{"text":"Food was good quite the abundance of fries and wings

Wings were delicious and big :)

Service not the greatest and not the nicest staff either"}
{"text":"Allstar Wings & Ribs just opens up in Scarborough. Accessible by LTR so is quite convenient if you are using public transit. 

Since it is new, the inside is nice and clean. Even all TVs are working! 

Service though extremely slow and they don't really carries a lot flavours or they out of it? After 3 tries before the server confirmed that they have the one I want.... FAIL

5 Alarm Inferno was as hot as I remembered in a good way. Allstar Wings Standard. The wings were meaty and juicy.. awesome

Everything took forever and the place was like empty? 

Hopefully it will improve over time?

And for the \"sporty\" waitress outfit, I will leave it for the guys to comment on.... why no waiter in sporty outfit though?"}
{"text":"Deep Fried anything is good drunk food? + Sunday and Monday Game Night 15 wings for the price of 10 is a sweet deal.

My Yelp Friend was hungry and ready to eat after a Yelp Elite Event. Those hot deep fried naked wings dressed in the hottest sauce (not really) or he enjoys to be surrounded with TV monitors of all sizes or The \"nice\" waitress?

For me, I just like to munch on a wing or 2 and watched all the action.. including watch someone ate almost all the wings we ordered.

I will be back for the Specials and to watch a game. Beer list though a little boring.. Why all these signs about Coors Light Specials?"}
{"text":"Greek fries!! Hot Buddha and Wings Gone Wild!! So good. But they need new seats or at least to fix them. Sorry no pics cause we were too hungry lol"}
{"text":"4.5 / 5 STARS 
Missing .5 star because where we sat there was alot of flys because apparently 'the door was left open all day and flys flew in'.

- excellent customer service- very knowlgeble about EVERY wing flavour
- 200 wing flavours
- wicked atmopshere- every table gets a t.v 
- clean washrooms
- great prices- mondays are 'wing night' 15 wings instead of 10 for $10.00
- tones of seating"}
{"text":"I've been to another location of Allstar Wings & Ribs, and I enjoyed that experience. This location is near Scarborough Town Centre, which adds to the growing list of restaurant chains in that area.
My friend and I waited about 30 minutes for a seat, it was a Saturday night so I didn't mind. The waiting area had a small sofa and it was getting cramped. 

The wait staff were nice, and prompt in the beginning. However, we waited awhile to receive our bill at the end of dinner. 

We ordered: Mozzarella Sticks, Honey Garlic wings and Shanghai Express wings. Everything was good but my friend said the Honey Garlic wings were too saucy. 

An earlier review stated that there are no descriptions next to the wing titles. Some of the flavours listed on the menu sounded good, but I had no idea what sauce was. It would be helpful if the names were more clear or if there was a 2-word description of the ingredients. 

Overall, I like the idea of a new wing place in Scarborough. I would like to come back again to try out more flavours."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings with a huge selection of sauces.  The wings are fairly small but cooked perfectly. Sat at the bar since it was pretty crowded for a Monday night. Bartender was very friendly and helpful with the sauce selection. Lively atmosphere of mostly younger crowd."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner, and it was super busy! We had to wait a while, but we didn't mind, we were expecting a line up. We decided to sit in the bar to have drinks until they called us. The hostess said the wait time was about 30-45 minutes to us, the couple before us and the group behind us, however we probably only waited about 15 minutes. 

For our appetizer, we got the Hail Caesar Fries, which were amazing! For my main dish, I ordered Pandora's Box (wings) and I loved it. During this visit, I feel like we got way more wings than we usually get (not complaining though)! If you love sweet thai chilli sauce, then you will def. love this flavour. 

Service wasn't bad, our waitress was kind, but I felt like she could've checked up on us a bit more but not bad. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions and will no longer go back. Too bad, it's not far from home and in a great location.
Comments:
Staff- while the waitstaff are obviously hired to pull in the male population of Vaughan (think Hooters with more clothing), they are indifferent to their customers. On our last visit, 2 of us ordered non breaded wings. They came breaded. When we called our waitress over she argued with us and said they weren't breaded....when we pulled the breading off...she just turned and walked away and muttered a comment about us (which we could clearly hear). She did not replace our wings or apologize.
Wings- the wings aren't bad. The choices are endless and they have some interesting combinations. The staff need a bit more training on the flavours though, as some of the so called hotter brands are quite mild. 
Atmosphere  - it's a sports bar...noise level is high, tv's are everywhere. Not a place to go for a quiet meal
Food - the nachos are very good...some of the best I've had. Lots of cheese and jalepeno.....burgers are a bit disappointing. 

Based on our last visit, the 4 of us will not go back. We'll drive the extra 10 minutes to go to Duffs. Too bad a rude waitress ruined a good thing....."}
{"text":"A pretty good place for wings, they have a big list with different flavours for people to choose from. They also have a really nice drink menu for those who enjoy drinking. The service was great at this place, all the servers kept checking up on us during the time we were there. I like the bar/ wings atmosphere, they have a lot television for people who enjoy watching sports. I like to cheer on the Raptors while enjoying a nice meal at this place.

This All Star location was pretty big, compared to the one in Markham.  The food was good, I like it more than St.Loius wings. I ordered the honey pepper wings with Mexican fresh. It was really delicious and filling. Overall, the food and service were great here and I will be back. 

Food: 3.5/5
Environment: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Alright, so I have been to this AllStar location many times and it's definitely an awesome joint to go to if you eat, breathe and sleep chicken wings lol. 

If you're coming for a big sports game, you better get your lazy ass here early because you'll be waiting a while otherwise.  I'd also recommend making a reservation if you're a group of 4 or more people. 

When it comes to the wings, well you have over 200 flavours that are categorized under a specific heat or spice rating, such as 3 star, 4 star, 5 star, 5 alarm etc.  If you can really eat spicy without crying like a wuss, you can probably handle 4 star and hotter. But it'd be wise to use your own discretion than rely on this awesome review. 

Seems like every time I go here, there are new girls working, which doesn't always bring out the best impression of how the employee experience probably is here.  Regardless, I must point out that you have some smokin sinoritas waitressing here  so that's always a plus, am I right fellas?!  Anyway, you'll have a really good time here with plenty of food choices to choose from outside of just wings. The only negative is the fact that they've raised the prices on most of their menu which sucks ass because I've been coming here for a while, oh well."}
{"text":"Currently living away from the GTA, I go to Allstars every time I visit home. Their wings are unparalleled, the Greek sauce they put on the Greek fries and All Thai'd Up wings are to DIE for. However, my most recent visit was absolutely terrible and I am so disappointed. The fries were served in a pool of oil and was inedible. I pointed it out to my server and she didn't do anything. The wings base sauce was also off. The breading was soggy and the sauce was not as red and flavourful as it should be. I'm hoping this was a one off considering I came in the afternoon. Would be interested to see if any other regulars noticed a decline in quality."}
{"text":"I don't know what was more annoying - having to download an app to figure out what the wing flavours encompassed, or waking up at 7:30 in the morning to expel my guts and make peace with the porcelain god. We'll start with the app first - I get it, they pride themselves on their long list of wing flavours, but I found this more mentally taxing than necessary. That's part of the appeal of this place, but frankly, I just found the whole thing overwhelming and ended up settling with 'suicide' because I was having a 'steady Mandy' moment. 

I have a thing about eating with my hands that I think I developed from wearing braces for 5 years (I cut up my pizza for a time) so I tend to steer clear of bone-in wings and prefer to order boneless. As this is not an offering here, I went with the tenders, which to my luck, came with fries and I had the option to sauce them up. My partner and his brother ordered bone-in wings and were surprised to find that fries did not come with it...uh...what? Aren't fries a staple? Oh well, no matter - they can eat some of mine.  

My partner's brother got through about 3 wings before he hit a wall - he was quiet, but I could detect that something was amiss. I finished my tenders without any issues, and forfeited my claim on the fries and let my partner eat the rest. As I leaned back against the booth, my stomach was in knots. It might have been the grease, but I downed the rest of my pint and deduced that it was nothing a bit of peppermint oil couldn't remedy - and I was right, peppermint oil was just what I needed.

...Or so I thought. Some nine hours later, I was awoken by hiccups and sharp searing pains in my stomach. Through some laboured breathing, I realized what was happening and that I was going to be sick.

And so I was, several times. I later learned that one hour earlier, my boyfriend's brother had experienced the same issue. 

The only reason I didn't outright give this place a one-star review is simply because of how friendly and attentive the waitress was. 

If you feel inclined to pay for an emetic, look no further than AllStar."}
{"text":"AllStars has a pretty big menu. I've been here a handful of times but, truth be told, I've only ever ordered the wings and fries. On Monday the AllStars special is pound and a half of wings for the price of a pound. With over 200 flavours, you could spend many Mondays here exploring the variety. This brings me to my first complaint. Unfortunately AllStars doesn't list any description of the sauces on the menu. For some, this isn't a problem (Mild, Medium, Hot, Honey Garlic, BBQ) but when you get into names like Vesuvius, Back in the Village, and Bizarre Love Triangle, making heads or tails of it is far more difficult. When it comes to the fries, they offer chilli fries, hail Caesar fries, etc. I would suggest asking for half the sauce/dressing/chili when ordering, or else you're going to get a basket of fries, absolutely covered to the point where you can't see them in sauce. If that makes your mouth water, then more power to you, but you end up with a soggy basket of fires and that's just not my bag.

Lastly, It's got a lot of big screen TVs (including one at each booth) and would be a great place to watch the game of multiple games at once."}
{"text":"Tiny ass wings and no credit cards? Weird. I'd rather go to the St.Louis Wings around the corner. Lots of roudy people go here; remember. ..someone did get stabbed with a fork here. Also many TVs for sports enthusiast in main bar area; they're inside the wall that meets the ceiling which is smart design but for some reason, this place doesn't feel comfortable to me."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a mini Wegz.  it has individual T.V in each side booth just like Wegz except its much smaller and more like a Bar type of place.  I did not see any Huge screens so i am not sure if they have a projector.  

the food is your typical bar type of food.  Fried items and burgers fill up the menu.  

It does have a lot of wing flavors, but a few stand out.  Stick with the signature TM ones and you should be good.  We got 6 different flavors, the two that stood out to me were the Grilled BBQ ones and the Ceasar/Texas ones.    

Its on the pricier side for scarborough, but its not an everyday thing so its okay."}
{"text":"Stopped in here looking for good wings and was awed by the massive selection of sauces you can choose from. Something like over 150 different wing sauces from mild to VERY WILD!!!

It was a mix of Buffalo Wild Wings meets Hooters. The waitresses were dressed in tight fitting cloths and push-up bras. Loads of sports on the tv's. When we were there it must have been Curling hour. That's all that was on. Meh

The service was suspect. Our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be at work that day. Never looked us in the eye. The bartender is the one who saved the day. She was very friendly and helped out where the server was lacking, which was everywhere. There was an extremely drunk guy in the bar that was hassling the barkeep and I never once saw a manager come out from anywhere to help out. I nearly help'd his ass out the door but the bartender seemed to have it from just going sideways fast. 

If you're into Hooters meets Cheers this is the place for you!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Location is better but service is OK.  The funky chipotle wings is just some jerk sauce mixed with tangy hot sauce. Neither flavourful nor memorable.

Stick to what you know works for your palate. I ideally prefer a bit of kick and alot of flavour and I have an above average heat tolerance. The menu has too many choices so it's a bit overwhelming for the first time visitor. 

Our waitress was nice but not good with details. The large screens are positioned all over the restaurant but not easy to view from where we were seated. Ambience is okay and the lighting is a bit stark."}
{"text":"was not very impressed from the beginning when i walked in
\"the king of wings\" they said...\"over 200 flavors\" our waitress boasted...
as a huge \"hot\" flavor and spice fan (putting it on damn near everything) i was disappointed with the list...first off, yes 200 flavors! well over! but no descriptions on the flavors such as \"Jamaican heat\" ok...elaborate more...?
not a single jalapeno, habenero, ghost pepper or trini-scorp pepper flavors...just flavors that promised to kick your ass...
ok...
i digress, the atmosphere was defiantly a bar setting, with tv's spanning every inch of the wall, ceiling, and window space...i joked with my friends that they could heat the restaurant with the tv's alone...i'm not kidding 
Saturday night is hockey night and boy they had hockey on every tv possible. 
onto the wonderful waitresses, they all looked pretty miserable, no smiling, no laughing, just \"what can i get ya\" and that's pretty much it...
as well, it appeared that the manager or owner...or both, wife decided to chew out a waitress in front of a table...highly unprofessional...
onto our food adventure, our group ordered food, and about half of it came first, followed by the second half ten minutes later, followed by \"food items they had missed\" 
disclaimer: we didn't just order wings...but we did have wings
we were given a napkin each for our meals...to which we had to ask for more napkins an additional four times...my bottomless drink that was stated in the menu...i hit the bottom every time i had a refill and was waiting on the waitress to grab me a new drink.
none of the staff here was personable...i still don't know the name of my waitress..which is kinda shocking from the standpoint of \"good evening, welcome, my name is...\" very standoffish and very non-personable
as well i felt that the waitresses went the extra mile for families...cause once they had to interact with kids...they had the biggest smiles on their face...
the food was sub-par at best, very bland flavors with over done jalapeno popcorn shrimp. the dessert menu is a joke, five cheesecakes, choco fudge cake and something else. no offering of pie...no offering of a \"brownie\" dessert
the location is in a great place, parking sucks, how warm it is in the restaurant sucks as well. 
I for one WILL never go back."}
{"text":"I am a long standing fan of Allstars Wings and restuarants.  I followed them from Markham to Richmond Hill, and from the old Richmond Hill location to the to new location.  
I was very happy when the Newmarket location opened.  Great location, same great wings.  Great for some beers and wings with the guys.  
Unfortunately, something was lost with this opening.  For the second time in a row, I have found the food overcooked significantly.  I had a bacon cheeseburger last night (because the burgers are normally so great there).  Both the burger and the bacon were way overcooked.  My buddy had wings... which were still good.  I found the service mediocre too (the table next to us got ketchup and mustard with their burgers, but not us).  When the waitress asked us if everyone was okay, my friend responded yes, and I started to speak, only to realize that she had walked away without even waiting for an answer from me.    
In the Richmond Hill location, you can always see the manager walking around, making sure everything is okay, making sure customers are happy, saying hello to people. In the approximately 10 times at the Newmarket location, I don't think I have ever seen a manager there (or at least I couldn't tell if there was one).  
So.. the wings still are good... but if you are looking for real quality and attention to detail, head down to the Richmond Hill location like me. 
I will be writing a rave review about the Richmond Hill location shortly as that place is definitely abover the rest in terms of quality.  
Cheers."}
{"text":"4/5 - Food 3/5 - Service
The wings are delicious, I can always enjoy them. There was an altercation where a batch of wings seemed to be old and dry though. Another altercation was where the food took over 45 minutes to be served.  There are problems that keeps occurring with the service. There are some servers who just don't seem to care, and many simple orders have been forgotten. I understand the restaurant is huge and some people who eat at these wings joints aren't always polite and patient; but bad service is experienced half the times I've been here."}
