{"text":"This place is awesome, some of the most authentic Turkish food I have ever had, the meat pies incredible and the borak is now a once a week addiction. You must try this place"}
{"text":"A friend took me to Anatolia and it has great food with decent prices. Also, the olive oil they sell is great and a great value for 9$ a litre! 
Hugely recommended."}
{"text":"Like much of the surrounding Crossroads market, Anatolia has recently received a face-lift with a long, low, and wide serving counter/steam tray that opens up to the back of the kitchen and the big domed flatbread griddle. Thankfully though, the food and value remain the same, they are now just better equipped to deal with the growing lunch lines.

The menu features many middle eastern regulars like falafel and doner kebab, but also standout entries like the stuffed eggplant and a dynamite braised lamb rib. The lamb rib is my usual go-to lunch, and I honestly don't know where else in the city you'll find so much great food for such a price. They've recently raised the cost of the lamb meal to a whopping $6.50, and it's worth easily twice that. He ribs are braised side ribs, so expect some cartilage and a few button bones, but they are braised in a hearty tomato sauce that is a nice counterpoint to the unctuous meat. The mains (whether ribs, chicken, or eggplant, etc.) also come with a nice rice pilaf, a scoop of bean salad, tabouli, and a chopped tomato salad. 

Also notable are the baked items. Oval buns stuffed with spinach and cheese, brushed with a sweet egg wash, and the borek flatbread cooked on the hemispherical griddle and served with fresh, house-made chili paste. 

The lines can get long, and the service is perfunctory and curt, but the food is so damn good and represents such a great value that this is an easy 5 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Always Yummy!!! They have some great value meal combos with options of meat or veggie plus salads. They also have delicious extras such as the borek (a Turkish hot bread with various filling options) and on occasion other things like amazing stuffed peppers. They have baked goods and everything is fresh and delicious. Anatolia is a sure thing for deliciousness. They have expanded over time. It would be great if they had more locations. This is in the Crossroads Market, so food court style - very casual."}
{"text":"Super tasty, great value. I eat the pide, lahem bajeen & lamb shank special fairly regularly and have never been disappointed. The line does get long at times, but thats because the food is so damn good!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try something new at Crossroads, I stopped at Anatolia & ordered their eggplant dinner for lunch. Was slightly off put, when the guy grabbed one of the plate of salads that I thought was on display and promptly smothered it in tzatziki. I had to ask for another one, because I can't have dairy and he did nothing to hide the annoyance on his face. Nor did he ask me which of their salads I wanted, even though they had a variety, and I was stuck with a quarter of a plate of tabouli that I couldn't eat either (gluten). I bit my tongue, because I was hungry and reasoned with myself that the plate full of rice; salad & baked eggplant was more than enough food. For about $10 with a drink, the price is right.

The eggplant was average. It had taken on the flavors of the tomato based sauce it had been baked in, but it was greasy and a little on the sour side. Fine, if you're just eating it with the mountain of rice they give you, but not when pairing it with the already lemon-heavy salads.

Didn't feel so hot for the rest of the day, after visiting this place. With so many other options in the market, I think I'll stick to the options I know will make me happy."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in farmers market. Everytime I think of going to different place but this place diverts my mind and brings me to them. Their lamb shank is the best and only for $11.. you cant go wrong with such a flavorful dish in this price. Also tried their eggplant with ground beef, it has so much flavor. Been there few times and have never displeased with the food or service."}
{"text":"Went to the Farmers market after a long time, the new renovated market offers a variety of food court type vendors and Anatolia was amongst the busiest, so I decided to try it. The Lamb shank was amazingly priced and delicious and the meat pie, and potato pie which I shared with my son was also amazing, I see why the lineups were the way they were. When visiting the Crossroads Farmers Market, make sure to try this very amazing food vendor."}
{"text":"Now, I know where to go on Fri, Sat or Sun for a bargain-priced lunch or dinner.  Anatolia at Crossroads Market!  I have to give credit to my sister for scouting out this fantastic place to eat.  We had the Egglant Dinner - comes with rice, fresh salad with white beans, basmati rice, the beautifully braised eggplant cut lengthwise stuffed with ground beef and a dollop of tzatziki sauce.  Save the best for last - Lamb Shank dinner - comes with rice, fresh salad with white beans, basmati rice, the gorgeously fall-off-the-bone Lamb Shank cooked in a very nice tomatoey sauce and a dollop of tzatziki sauce as well.  For 4 people, the 4 entress cost only $46!!  That's pretty darn good price!  Decided to also try their Spinach and Feta Turnover Bread. Think it's called Poacha.  So delicious!  Bought extra to bring home for a light snack.  Also, had their Baklava which had flaky, buttery phyllo pastry with pistachios drowned in honey syrup.  The bakalva just melted in your mouth.

Food kiosk is found right at the back of the food area.  If you approach the washrooms, do a hard left and down the corridor at the end is Anatolia.  

Accepts cash and debit cards only.

Will definitely be back to try more."}
