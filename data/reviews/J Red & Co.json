{"text":"Finally not another chain. This place is exactly what Brampton needs
AMAZING FOOD. Good selection of wine / beers on tap and bottled craft. 
Great atmosphere and service. 
Have got to try the Vietnamese lettuce wraps. Cauliflower wings. And the creole crab dip is off the charts. 
For dessert the Signiture Parfait was a winner."}
{"text":"Made a reservation coz there's 8 of us but place was empty when we got in around noon. The overall inside furnishing was very nice. Very inviting. Lots of parking and restaurant was cozy. I ordered the bento box and it was a good size for me. Even comes with a dessert. Some of my family members ordered burger.. soup.. salad... fish and chips... sandwich. They all liked what they got but maybe not the best as compared to the price you pay for. They are a bit pricey for the portions they serve but maybe you pay for the ambiance too. Our server was nice and comes to check on us from time to time.. but not sure if that's becoz there aren't too many guests around. 
I would go back and try to eat at a different day and time just to see how the service is at dinner time maybe. All in all, it was a good dining experience. Not high end but not a cheap place either."}
{"text":"Late lunch visit with the girls. Was greeted at door and seated immediately always nice to not wait. Our servers came to table quickly and introduced themselves one was training the senior server explained what they hoped we would experience with their menu basically a well groomed menu with something for everyone but with a little twist. I believe it has Thai flare with Cajun? Influence.  Decor reminded me of more casual Beer Market.

We quickly ordered I chose to have their daily chowder soup it was very good but a little small for a full size serving. Also chose their specialty which was Thai chicken and shrimp noodle it was ok good flavor nothing overpowering I feel it  could have used a little heat or something.Not outstanding as I was told it was highly recommended.  The other ladies  chose to have a fish entrée and steak entrée both said just ok not impressed .  The dessert menu came and my friends who love dessert could not find anything they were interested in so we decided to go across to the No Frills and buy I ingredients to make our dessert:(

Sorry won't be going back.   But did have premier service very friendly guys."}
{"text":"Awesome new brunch joint for north Brampton! Try their egg diablo and the banana stuffed french toast !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Came here with my family the other night and had an incredible time. We came on a busy night, the place was packed! Service was excellent, the host did her absolute best to accommodate us even though we didn't have a reso! Try the chicken and waffles, fell inlove the first time I tried them!  All in all we had an incredible experience, great wine selection, the waitress was happy to suggest the Stockhill GSM, great service and great food! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had heard so much about this place but left beyond disappointed. Our waitress was rude, ignored us half the time & also made snide remarks to one of my friends(2x) as she was walking away. We were all very polite so there was no need for her behavior! The food wasn't anything special & definitely not worth the price they charged. Management didn't seem much better & didn't bother coming over when we asked to speak to the owner who was walking around."}
{"text":"At first I was really excited to try this restaurant as I read a lot of great reviews on it. The food options on the menu sound really good too but I was not at all impressed with the food. My husband and I ordered the mac & cheese samosas as an app. These were a huge disappointment as they lacked flavour. Next we had the chicken and waffles and the Thai dish. Once again I was not too happy with the chicken and waffles. The chicken did not look or taste like your typical fried chicken that comes with waffles. I'm usually not a very picky eater but I was disappointed because the food was expensive. The Thai dish was somewhat good but the chicken was dry and over cooked. 

We did not order drinks and our total bill for the food came up to about $70 before tip. We thought this was quite pricey for a place where the food was not excellent. The only good thing about this restaurant was the friendly service we received but we definitely will not return to this place."}
{"text":"We celebrated my dad's 75th birthday last night at J Red.  The hostess brought us to our table and was happy to accommodate our request to choose a different table.  The server was friendly and attentive, making suggestions and recommendations for specific house favourites.  The food was served quickly, was hot and VERY tasty.  Our group had the steak, Parmesan encrusted chicken & pasta, Chicken & Waffles, Meat pizza, Bob & Doug burger, Wings & fries and a kids pizza.  Everyone in our group said their meal was very good.  I had the chicken & pasta and it was OMG good!  The restaurant brought us the Nutella pizza to celebrate my dad's 75th and it too was tasty. The ambiance was relaxing and we would highly recommend it for big groups or intimate dates.  

Thanks to J RED for their part in making my dad's birthday an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get, but I tried the mac and cheese samosas and the crispy eggplant sandwich and they were both bomb!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friend and the food is mediocre and over-priced. Below are what we ordered:

Bod and Doug burger: good
Superfood Salad: not good, there's cumin in the vinaigrette , which is very odd. The kale was blanched. Nothing special, I can make it at home, though I would not put cumin in it.
Thai Fighter: meh... for $19 I would expect something more stand out. The chicken bits were dry. 

I would not recommend unless you want to go just for the ambiance. No comments on drinks as I didn't order any. Would rather spend my money on a hole in a wall for a great food experience"}
{"text":"I was very confused by this place. I read lots of good reviews. My husband and I Went around 3pm on a Sunday. The place was huge but empty (understandable at that hour). We ordered the appetizer of the salt n vinegar Popcorn shrimp. I believe it was around 14$ and certainly not worth the price. Very small portion, overcooked and didn't seem much different then the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Served on a wood plank mixed in with a paper bag of popcorn. Strange and confusing. My husband had the Thai bowl and he didn't really care for it. I had the chicken and waffles which I found to be very overpriced. The chickens breast pieces seemed panko crusted and dried out. The waffles were soggy and coated in some kind of strange cream sauce. I was sorely dissapointed- especially considering the price and portion size. The server was super friendly and talkative. I did enjoy the artwork."}
{"text":"What's all the hype about? 
Definitely not the food!

To start we ordered the 'brisket bombs' with creole mustard. I wasn't happy with either the taste or presentation.
I mean, when is shredded kale ever appealing? Lolla rosa or even red kale would of been better.

Next we had the 'Eh'loha pizza'.
I've honestly had better 'Hawaiian' at the local 241. 
What's the point of a wood burning oven if your pizza doesn't come out piping hot with gooey bubbly cheese? 
Pizza was cold and shyte. 

And along comes our steak and potatoes.
Steak was cooked well and it's a good thing the boyfriend enjoys gristle, because there was plenty of it.
Potatoes tasted only of black pepper.

Our saving grace.. Dessert perhaps?
Hardly.
'Smashed lemon' which came in a pretentious little pot (ours) without the meringue I might add. 
Hands down the worst dessert I've ever had at a restaurant.
Owner needs to hire a pastry chef ASAP!"}
{"text":"Was very happy that B town has this spot now. It is my go to spot. Its good for casual dining on the patio or in the bar area, and then you can get a little more contemporary in the dining hall. Live music is a nice touch. The food is excellent and on par for value for your money. I recommend trying this spot before heading out of town for a bite to eat (my little nephew loves the wood burning iron pizza)."}
{"text":"Came in and had to wait over an hour for a table. It was pretty bad, because when we waited for our table at ten bar we ordered some drinks and that along took about 45 mins to get them when I had to walk up a remind them about it. Atmosphere is pretty cool and hipster like but the mac and cheese spring rolls are ok and the wings and pizza is so so. I would come back to try a main course but I would reserve a table beforehand before I go in cause the wait is crazy long ! That is what turned us off and made our experience their much worse"}
{"text":"Brampton is absolutely fortunate to have this restaurant. Everything from the decor to the service was outstanding. Chantal was charming and happy to answer every question we had and the food was incredible. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. There is something for you here. Oh and the beer choices are off the charts as well."}
{"text":"Nice place. Really enjoyed it. I had the Thai Fighter and it was spicy hot good!!! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews online, I knew I definitely wanted to check this place out for myself. Located at Main Street and Vodden, on the southwest corner. The restaurant is located in a relatively small plaza, parking shouldn't be too hard, if so, I would just park across the street where the No Frills is.

The place itself is very spacious, lots of seating options for everyone. Decor is also pretty modern. Has a bit of a hipster-vintage vibe to the place with warm orange incandescent lights hanging from the ceilings. My friend and I got placed in a large booth. It was a Monday night, so the place was pretty quiet.
 
As for the food, I tried the mac and cheese samosas. They were delicious! The samosa shell was well seasoned and the mac and cheese was piping hot, but a great blend between south Asian and Western foods. I even loved the \"ketchup\" that they served along with the food, it was so savoury, I will admit that I held onto it and saved some for my upcoming meal.
*Update* I came back and ordered the mac and cheese appetizers and they changed them to spring rolls stuffed with mac and cheese instead. I personally didn't like them, I would rather have a denser pastry that is a bit more chewier than a crispy spring roll wrapper.

I ordered the Thai-fighter Pad Thai. I had pretty high expectations after the mac and cheese samosas, but alas, it wasn't that great. To me pad thai is normally cooked with tamarind so you get that sweet and tangy taste. But all I got was a lot of coconut, and possibly some peanuts as well, which meant that after a couple of bites I was starting to get full. Chicken was diced, but felt a little dry and unseasoned. Shrimp on the other hand was flavourful. Was this the best pad thai I ever had? No, there are definitely better options, and for cheap I might add. The Thai-Fighter pad thai will run you $19 before tax and tip.

My friend ordered the smoked apple. I think that was the real winner here. Even when the waitress came by to serve our food she said the pizza smelled delicious and that she wanted a piece. The pizza was topped off with apples and smothered in cheddar cheese. So each bite you take, you taste the tang of the tomato sauce, a crunch of sweetness from the apple, and the tartness of the cheddar cheese. I will admit, I gave up on my pad thai I ordered and ate a few slices of my friend's pizza.

Overall, I would probably come back here again and try the other items on the menu. It isn't a cheap eats kind of place, as an appetizer, and two meals cost about $60. While the pad thai was a bit of a letdown, the other items I tried from the menu has left me intrigued and eager to come back to see what else they can offer."}
{"text":"Seriously great place! Brampton has needed a place like this for a very long time. The service was great, very cool atmosphere, and the food was amazing.  The menu had so many great things to pick from.  
I had the Thai Fighter noodle dish recommended by Dane our server, OMG it's like crack in a bowl. Had the 3 dip appetizer with smoked avocado guacamole... yes..... smoked avocado guacamole. My son had a pizza from the wood fired oven, amazing.
AND local craft beer. I am going back on Tuesday for the live music and 'Buck a shuck' oysters!!

My new go to place."}
{"text":"Meal started with some lukewarm tap water.. Strange having to ask for ice to your drink. Mac and cheese samosas are a hit, mains are mediocre. A spot you go for apps and a drink! Cant say its 10/10 based on location, unorganized service, food 7/10"}
{"text":"I was hoping for it to be better then it was.  The food was ok - not out of this world, the decor was nice but the service was needed some help.  Our order was mixed up and the waitress did not bring back the right change.  Hopefully it will get better as they work out the quirks"}
{"text":"We went here based on good reviews. I will review the following items we ordered:

Mac and cheese Samosa=good
Meat pizza=burnt
The king pizza= burnt
Wings=no taste
Grilled chicken= was okay but rice was not good
Zucchini fritters=good


Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. The Mac and cheese samosas are to die for. We ordered The OG pizza and it came out a bit burnt so we asked to send it back and they sent us a fresh one and took it off the bill. I'm definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"Really good find in Brampton, as there are not that many places here with good food and a nice comfortable atmosphere. We had burgers and 2 kids meal. Everything was great and environment was comfortable."}
{"text":"Try the smashed lemon dessert! It was such an amazing dessert and satisfied my sweet tooth! I wish I could of provided a pic but ate it so fast. Definitely a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Awesome,awesome, awesome- probably the best restaurant in brampton! Creative, delicious food and so very fresh- I've had their signature dish- yum, last week I had the oyster casino, cooked to perfection. The brisket bombs are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. The place is massive in case you have a large group. I had the Bob and Doug burger. It was very good. A little on the pricey side but the portions are huge. I could barely bite the burger it was so big. I would recommend going for dinner. It wasn't the quickest meal for lunch time. But overall the experience was great."}
{"text":"Creative food pairings, 
Based on one visit.  Will go back another day."}
{"text":"Awesome first visit for dinner tonight and won't be our last! Nice decor, interesting and diverse menu and the staff were all very friendly. Welcome to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The food was nothing special, and the service was mediocre. 

We arrived as a group and the service was so slow, and we didn't even see our server half the time. We waited 45 minutes after sitting down before waving down the server to ask if we can order our food. She went around the table to take orders and when she got to me and my partner, we ordered an appetizer and a main. She asked us if we wanted our appetizer before our mains, we said yes. Then we waited ANOTHER HOUR before the food came out, but that's not the worst part yet. Our appetizer came out with everybody else's main course! That's when the server came by and then said to us \"oh good, you guys got your appetizer, I'll ring your mains in now.\" Our jaws dropped! ha! My partner and I sat there for fifteen minutes after finishing our small appetizer with no food in front of us while watching 16 of our other friends eat their main course. We ate our mains when our friends finished their meals. I just can't believe the server said she will ring in our main course like it was a normal practice for her?! I understand some people might want everything out at the same time, but when you ask the guests if they want their apps first - isn't it suppose to come out before the rest of the table get their mains, and then the guests that ordered the appetizer will receive their mains with everybody else? Bill time for an appetizer is a fraction of the time of 18 main dishes. She could of rang in the appetizer first, and then send the 18 dishes in a second bill right after the app went in, and the app would of still came out first. Don't ring in the appetizer with the mains and then ring in those mains after! I don't think I know any server who would think that's a normal practice. 

Food - The cauliflower wings and pesto pasta was delicious but the other dishes were Okay. A little blend and need a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"The service was really well and the food was amazing the chowder soup was delicious. The atmosphere was very quite for the time that I went so everyone was able to engage in conversion also the food was delivered on time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I drove past it a few weeks before the opening day and thought hey what is this place and why haven't I heard of it? 

When it actually did open, boy Oh boy was this place packed. I've heard nothing but good things about J. Red&Co, and their service and food was amazing. The waiters and waitresses are very sweet and the ambiance of the restaurant was very warm, despite the temperature being below freezing. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by someone at the front who told us that there were quite a few reservations so we'd have to wait a while, which both my friend and I really didn't mind at all. We were seated on the opposite side of the bar which wasn't a big deal to us, at this point we just wanted food. 

Our server, I can't remember her name, was very sweet. She took care of us and made sure we got our food. 

We first ordered the Mac and cheese samosas, which were undoubtedly the topic of the night. Not only were they moist on the inside, and crispy on the outside, they left us contemplating a second order! For our main course, I ordered the fire grilled steak frites, and my friend ordered the Breton burrito. 

The steak was done medium rare and the gravy which was surrounded by peppercorns was TO DIE FOR. If I was on death row, I'd have to ask for that as my last meal. The fries were pretty delicious too, I ended up spelling both our names on the plates. 

The burrito as my friend was saying, was definitely very good, she couldn't finish it unfortunately since it was such a large portion, so if you're not as hungry, I wouldn't recommend the burrito. But hey, they do have take away trays for your convenience! 

Overall, our entire experience from start to finish was amazing. The food was very delicious, and the staff who worked there on the day we visited definitely knew what they were doing. 

P.s. Do not be alarmed by the flames in the kitchen, there are skilled chefs at work!"}
{"text":"the Food was great. About time Brampton had a Restaurant like this to go to. A little expensive but worth it for special occasions.  Good choices. I loved there Macaroni samosa."}
{"text":"I came here with colleagues for lunch today. The restaurant has a great look to it - bright, open, stylish. Our server was excellent. Friendly, helpful, efficient. 

We ordered a few apps and mains. I tried the brisket bombs and the chicken wings from the apps we ordered. The wings were amazing. Crispy and flavourful with a nice hot sauce on the side. The brisket bombs were a tad boring - somewhat dry and one-note in flavour. 

I tried the montreal clubhouse with a house salad for my main. The salad was pretty much a complete write-off. Overly dressed and wilted fragile greens. If your greens are so fragile and dainty, you need a much lighter dressing (a light vinaigrette perhaps) and a much lighter hand with the dressing. Or stick with the heavy dressing (some Thai deal which was pretty tasty) and use a more robust green like romaine hearts.

The clubhouse was tasty, but frankly it didn't need to be a clubhouse. They stuck an extra \"bottom\" bun in the middle of the sandwich. It didn't need it. You could have just sold the sandwich as a smoked meat sandwich with bacon. The extra bun threw off the bun-to-meat ratio in favour of bun and the ratio should, if anything, skew positively towards the meatside of that equation."}
{"text":"That was a disappointing experience.

I hesitate to not let emotion get the better of me while writing this, because while I'm sure that the lunch and dinner menus are stellar, the Mother's Day Brunch my family and I attended (the first such brunch that the restaurant has held, according to what I heard from the servers) was ultimately frustrating and not up to our expectations.

I had been meaning to visit J. Red & Co., as I was aware that there was a Yelp Elite event several weeks back (which I hadn't attended), and the guests who took part in it spoke very highly of the Thai-influenced menu, specifically the \"Thai Fighter\" dish. It was a bit of a surprise to arrive at the restaurant and learn that not only was this the restaurant's first experiment with a brunch menu, but that the options presented were ultimately limited and forgettable.

When we arrived, one family member had come in advance and had been waiting for 15 minutes for our eight-person table to be set up, clearly annoyed with the situation. As we walked to our table, I noticed a scant number of the brunch items set out on a pair of tables. My initial confusion was somewhat allayed by our waitress' note that there was also a station nearby where you could get a custom omelette made fresh for you.

The weakest part of the experience was the brunch itself. There was no information on it on the website itself, so we had to go in blind. 

We were told that we couldn't order anything off the menu due to the aforementioned brunch (if you came in and wanted food, this was the only thing you could order), and what was presented was basically a second-rate breakfast buffet. Cold scrambled eggs, Caesar salad that tasted slightly mushy due to too much dressing, eggs Benedict that looked (and tasted) like it had been sitting out for hours, and prime rib that was a bit too pink for my liking. We did inform a server at the buffet station that the food was cold, and to their credit, they put lids over the trays and turned on the burners underneath to warm them up.

Considering the reputation I had seen here on the review page and through the glowing reviews offered by several prominent members of the Yelp community, I was shocked and disappointed that there was none of the restaurant's signature Thai flair on display. I sampled a bit of pasta they also had that reportedly one family member told me had \"hot sauce\" in it, but it was just some standard elbow pasta with the tiniest hint of spice.

Hell, they could have done so much with this buffet. Some more meat options, a platter of vegetables, more lunch options, something, anything! Even the desserts came off as being reheated from frozen and sporting bland taste.

The only thing that really saved the experience was the omelette station. We were able to choose any of five ingredients and watch as the omelette was made by a very chatty, pleasant chef who was more than happy to accommodate vegetarian or egg white-only requests. Likewise, the servers were very outgoing and chatted at length with us about the restaurant itself and how busy it was that day - an estimated 250-300 people were expected to come through.

That being said, I wouldn't have come here and paid $23 plus tax if I knew that all I was going to get would be a bunch of cold breakfast options, a tray of pasta, soggy salad and (admittedly-great) potato salad. I would have just gone to a Golden Griddle or other breakfast joint in my local neighborhood and paid half the price for something with better quality. Half of our group basically swore off the place and said they'd never come back.

In spite of everything I just said, I'd likely return here for the dinner menu because I know how good it will be based on the recommendation of the community. The brunch as it stands was a wholeheartedly lackluster affair, even for a first try, and I hope my next experience here will be better.

I'll amend my review if/when I return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service
The restaurant is clean and nicely laid out 
The prices are reasonable especially for what you get.  Parking is pretty good"}
{"text":"Omg the pork belly tacos!!!! Get them. Everything was pretty good except for the waitress. I dont know her name, nor would I have mentioned it if I knew. That being said, she seemed like she didnt want to be there, super fake \"i dont care\" type smile, barely came around and just the slightest bit rude. Maybe it was a bad day for her, but it was just after 2 or 3pm with no other customers. When new customers came in, they were sat a table away from us. The waitress perked up and was nicer to us around this point. Probably because my friend and i seem young and the couple that came in was older. Im guessing the waitress thought we wouldnt tip. I have worked in the industry and everywhere I go, I tip very well even if you do a pretty crap job. Anyway, I asked for the bill and her eyes lit up, she was finally making eye contact with my friend and I, smiling, joking, and whatever else.  we know u just wanted your tip! I go to restaurants for the food as well as the experience. Because of this experience, I dont think I will be returning very often. Maybe as a last minute thought or something, maybe less. I will give it another shot at some point in time. The food IS really good though! Hats off to the Chef!
... and yes i did tip her, nevertheless."}
{"text":"The service is delightful with very reasonable timing. I had the stuffed chicken which is first on their mains menu and it was so good! Our server was so friendly and she gave great suggestions for the drinks! And the food display and quality is amazing! Definitely a place to go for any occassion - birthday, date, casual outing with friends etc."}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant 5 stars because I was completely taken back by how awesome they are.

I had come here for a Yelp event back in February and we had some of the most awesome apps to sample... one thing I was craving was the shrimp bite size samplers that came with fresh lobster salsa - let me tell you how delicious it was! 

I was so disappointed when I looked at the menu and realize it wasn't on there because it was specially whipped up for the help crowd. I had mentioned it to the waitress that I came in for this specific dish, she apologized that it was featured.

we placed our order and shortly after that the manager came around to tell me she has spoken to the chef and he was happy to whip up a batch for us - but they were a lot bigger than the sample ones we had. I was super excited. I really appreciated the chef coming out to describe the plate to me and my friends! I really hope this ends up on the menu one day! 

we also had the cauliflower fries, the pad Thai and the chicken pasta! everything was delicious and flavourful - definitely will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"I don't know much (J.Red) but I know I love you... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNX1JLRSiyg

So while the old sounds of Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt fill your ears let me describe the love affair that began this week as I visited J.Red & Co for the first time - it's a story of food that not only filled my belly... but filled my soul as well!

HA HA... OK I really wanted to do this review as cheesy as possible but as I sit hear listing to this song, I can't keep a straight face (mostly because I'm asking how in the heck Aaron Neville was popular in the 80's with that Jerry Curl and that yawn-like voice), but you know when you have a crush on someone and anytime you think about them you just smile. Yeah well I'm thinking about my meal yesterday for lunch and I'm literally beaming from ear to ear. 

So J.Red & Co is the passion project of head chef and owner Jason Rosso who has been cooking all over the world for nearly 30 years. The moment you walk in the smell of firewood hits you, not because the building is on fire but because their giant stone oven is blazing, fired by wood and cooking pizza to order. I'd describe the decor as an eclectic mix between refined and rustic, settling somewhere in the casual dining area. 

I didn't bother to look at the menu much once I was seated and essentially let chef choose for me so he suggested I start with the Mac'N'Cheese Samosas and follow it up with his signature dish. Now before i go any further, yes you heard that right, Samosas filled with hot and gooey mac'n'cheese. What a crazy combination, but it totally works! You get about 4-5 samosas in an order with each being about 2-3 bites. These were incredible... just incredible.

Now on to the signature dish: The Thai Fighter. I learned that Chef Jason was at one point in time not only a chef in Thailand but also training in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), and while he was there he learned how to make a unique Thai street food dish from a local who would cook it fresh daily off the back of a mo-ped scooter which he'd fashioned a small kitchen to the back. Bringing this recipe in it's exact form back to Canada with him, it's a flavourful perfectly spiced, delicious dish that you can easily ask to have the heat kicked up on, but for the timid the standard offering is... \"just right\" so it's good for all tastes. I'd like to tell you more about this dish but it's the reason I'm smiling today... seriously. It's not quite a thai curry, not quite pad thai, it's shrimp, noodles, chicken, veggies, basil and a little bit of heaven. So rather than me ruin it for you... just get in there and try it.

I was drinking water but I did make note of their on tap offerings which included two wines on tap! They've got a super diverse bottled beer selection so I think you'll be impressed with it if you're into \"good beer\". I'm excited to come back next week for lunch again so I can try more of their menu

So to quote Mr. Neville once again \"And that may be all YOU need to know...\"

Thus far on our Canadian vacation...we've only encountered helpful people."}
{"text":"Rating: This place is a solid 3 1/2* place. The bump of half of star is for the server we got. 

I came to J Red for a work function this past week. It was my first time there. This place is located in the intersection of Main and Vodden with ample parking. 

I was impressed with the decor and size of the place as it was able to accommodate between 40 to 50 of us without being cramped. I would call the decor a modern upscale beer hall type of setup. 

We had a preset menu of 3 choices so I did not order anything from their regular menu. We had a choice of Angus Burger with fries, Thai noodles and Cheese Pizza. I went with the Angus Burger which was great unfortunately, the fries were a bit lacking. Our one server was great. I wish I could have asked her name as she was the only one serving our large party and she was able to remember all of our orders and names without messing up. She was awesome! They have a pretty extensive list of alcoholic beverages so you will be well taken care. 

A great time was had by all of us here. 

#53 of 2018."}
{"text":"As with all restaurants there are good and bad. The atmosphere is loud and busy. We were a group of 10 people. I liked that they served our appetizers and salads as \"family style\".  I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers and the pizzas. I also enjoyed the selection of desserts. 
On the down side, no matter how open and lively your place may be, wine deserves to be served in a proper wine glass, not a whiskey glass. White wine, since served chilled, is to be kept in a chilled container once opened. Once our whiskey glasses of white wine were poured, the open bottle was set on our table, not in a bucket of ice. My friend's red wine was also poured into a whiskey glass,  not a proper wine glass where the wine can breathe.
There was constant water on the table - but at room temperature. Not too thirst quenching.
I had steak as my main course. I have never had such a bland tasting steak. I couldn't eat it. 
Not sure that I will return to this restaurant. Maybe with my own wine glass!"}
{"text":"This place continues to get better. The service is always great. Indeed, a shout-out to server Dain for giving me and two other colleagues a stand-out business lunch the other day! 

One thing I want to add as a longer-term customer though, is that the menu changes with the season, and it always has new surprises. So everything I said before still stands, but I want to compliment J. Red & Co on keeping the menu fresh. Too many restaurants get lazy about it, but not you, and that's part of why my husband and I remain loyal J. Red fans!"}
{"text":"Second time here...not exactly sure how I managed to miss a review on my first visit?? 

I love everything about this place-decor was very cool and different for lil ol Brampton. We were sat right away by a very pleasant hostess and quickly greeted by our server who took our drink orders. Umm, strawberry mojito's-yes please! 

Started with a warm crab dip with home made chips, that were crispy perfection. My friend order the grape chicken dish and we ordered a bunch of sides to share-lobster Mac and cheese, poutine and cauliflour wings-that was not a typo. All were amazing. Sooo maybe we left room for for the Nutella balls which were tiny fried donuts served fondue style with a rich warm Nutella dip. So worth the unnecessary calories!

Cant wait to return and make my way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! They had a lot of very creative menu options, filled with in-house made food. I've been here twice now, and still haven't tried everything I want to try. Great servers, lots of interior space for our large party. I'd definitely come here again. Even just for the lobster mac and cheese and the Nutella fondue haha."}
{"text":"Well this spot just opened up in the Brampton area and it has been open for about 2 weeks now.  My girls really wanted to check it out so I joined them.

Now I hate to give this restaurant 4 stars, but there were some areas where they fell slightly short on getting the 5 star rating.  Now remember, 4 stars is not a bad rating at all.

So let's get started.  We were a group of 5 women who love food to the fullest, so we wanted to try as many things as we could.

Appetizers:
- Rick's Mac and cheese samosa (these were good...great crispy outside and yummy Mac and cheese inside)

- Crispy Nashville style wings (the wings were my favourite, I would have salted it with a tad more of flavour.  But overall large sized wings fried to a crispy gold)

- Creole spiced brisket bombs (this was probably my least favourite, I didn't really like the texture of the brisket inside and it was heavy on the cumin...I think that was the spice in it)

- Green zucchini fritters (these were good as well, reminded me of a vegetable pakora)

- A trio of roasted red pepper hummus (the bread was nice and soft, out of the 3 dips, the warm spinach one was my favourite, not so much the hummus.)

Now our entrees:

- Le Frenchie salad (I personally ordered this dish and I must say, I love salads and this really didn't do it for me.  It was missing that oomph of flavour, more acidity would have been nice.  Also, I think if they used a seared ahi tuna, would have made the salad better.  The ahi tuna seemed like it was from a can and the texture wasn't the best)

- Prime squared burger (hands down, this was the best thing from our mains.  The burger was so tender and juicy)

- Fire grilled steak frites (the fries were cooked nicely and crispy.  The steak could  of had more seasoning.  It wasn't bad but it needed something.)

- Pappardelle bourginon  (the pasta was cooked nicely, but it did lack in flavour.  It needed more salt and possibly more garlic would have brought out the flavours.  Beef was tender though)

- Montreal clubhouse sandwich (this sandwich would have been good if there wasn't so much whole grain mustard.  It overpowered the sandwich and gave it an off taste.  Suggestion would be to have it on the side to control the mustard portion.

Now the service...
Everyone who came to our table were extremely pleasant and friendly.  Our table was wobbly and they tried to fix it right away.  Also, the server was very diligent in keeping us informed or aware of anything that may not be up to par.  For example, she let us know ahead of time that the glassware for the wine was not in an actual wine glass and asked if that was ok.  Also, when the wine we ordered wasn't chilled, she informed us of the issue and suggested another similar wine instead that was ready.  The food came out in a timely manner and we got a complimentary Nutella pizza for dessert!  Which was yummy!  

The decor is very modern and inviting.  I like the layout and the colours.  Great for large groups.

Overall, for a brand new place...I think this place is doing well so far with the menu, just minor tweaks.  Great atmosphere and staff.  I definitely want to come back to taste the brunch menu.  I think this place will be good in Brampton, we're missing a place like this in our town.

Everyone should give this place a try!!  

Thank you again for a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a late lunch and the atmosphere is quite unique and hipster. We shared a popcorn shrimp appetizer and the beef bourguignon farfelle pasta dish. The popcorn shimp was quite unique in the presentation with it coming in a popcorn bag mixed with real popcorn.  The beef bourguignon was quite tender. Would come back to the place if back in area."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly anticipating this place's opening as they'd been building. The thought of a unique, modern and upscale restaurant in Brampton was exciting enough; however having one only a stone's throw from my place (well, if Jose Bautista was throwing) only built up the anticipation that much more.

I finally made it in today and was floored by how gorgeous and spacious the place is. It's modern decor with quite a bit of flair, and the place could probably fit 100 people. Very friendly and attentive staff to greet and service us throughout the meal.

I was with the little guy, and figured the safest thing to do would be order pizza for him. The pizzas on the menu are all around the $15 range, but when I described that he just wanted pepperoni and they figured it was just for him, they said they had a kids one. It's not on the menu, but a great option to have, especially since it's 1/2 the price of the pizzas on the menu. Not the cheapest item you'll find for kids if you compare to other places; but a fair price since it's still great quality and cooked in a wood-fired oven. He loved it naturally.

I went for \"Backyard Special\" burger which is essentially a standard burger with cheddar. That said, all of the ingredients are premium, from the brioche bun, mixed greens and fresh angus patty. That quality was evident in the tasting and even the cheese really stood out. There was a great house-made relish on the side which was nice. I went for the house salad, and glad I did since it was made with top quality greens, as well as roasted peppers with cheddar in a subtle chilli vinaigrette. 

It's only my first visit; however I can confidently say this place is primed to be the best restaurant in town in almost every respect. Moreover, J Red and Co. would stack up against virtually any comparable place in the GTA. I'm so glad there's finally a place like this locally. Now it's up to others - Bramptonians in particular - to discover this place for themselves and celebrate something that's been lacking for so long until now."}
{"text":"I definitely will return here, especially to try the Mac and cheese samosas! I had the Thai fighter and to be completely honest it was not spicy whatsoever, I even added tons of hot sauce ( which wasn't even spicy either so that did nothing). Nonetheless it was definitely a good dish and it is a good portion size. Service here was great as well, so overall pretty good experience"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last week and both times had a very good meal at a reasonable price. I enjoyed the Thai Fighter, it has a great flavour. On Tuesday I was wowed by the buck a shuck oysters! They were out of Malpeque so we're serving French Kiss oysters from NS. They were delicious!  We were a party of 9 and Heather, our server, did a valiant job keeping up with our sharing & splitting. The Happy Hour specials, half price bottles of wine and live jazz made it an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great fare but kind of unoriginal. Would like this celebrity chef to kick it up a notch with some healthier (less greasy) options and ticketed food events."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Really great live music and awesome atmosphere tucked away at main and vodden in Brampton.  A must go especially for date night. Service was impeccable and the servers knew the menu back and forth. They must have to study it before their shift!"}
{"text":"Different atmosphere, different menu items but a great experience. Just slightly higher than average prices but above average selections. You won't walk into just Any old restaurant and fund these menu items. 
The food is excellent and service is good. 
Mac and cheese samosa's are amazing."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying J Red and it totally lived up to all the good things I've been hearing. The service was great and I was able to meet with Chef Jason, so personable. 

We had the 3-trio dip to start, the pesto so delicious. With a name like Thai Fighter, I had to get this dish which was inspired by Chef Jason's travels to Southeast Asia. It was a good portion size and I while I shouldn't have finished it, I could stop, it was so good. It was my daughters birthday and they brought out their Nutella Pizza - the crust was thin, warm and the Nutella spread was just the right amount of sweet. 

I highly recommend J Red, it's great to have one-off restaurants like this with personality in Brampton. I'll definitely be back - thanks Jason and the entire team!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed...this restaurant needs to put some flavour into their food or im hoping its just the dishes we ordered. We had to put hot sauce on EVERYTHING, to give it a lil favour. We had the eggplant tower, hummus and pesto dip (was not a fan of this combo) and beef ribs( wayy too saturated in sauce!) Truthfully we felt a lil sick after the food, couldnt stomach it and had to order a mint tea to settle my stomach.
 
Hate to start out soo negative, but we definately wont care to return. A little on the pricey end, but thankfully we had a gift card lol.
Decor and ambience of venue is odd, esp with odd wall pictures, not sure what the idea was there. 

Service was below average, one of the waitresses seemed very unprofessional and inexperienced. Told us a table was reserved, but seated us beside that table, ( same amt of seating) only to see it was not reserved as they moved a table of three from another seating area to the \"reserved\" seating. Our waitress then forgot our dessert at one point until we reminded her.

Was quite surprised of the experience, considering the reveiws and the fact it was a downtown location..anyway hope this helps"}
{"text":"I hardly ever go to Brampton.  If I'm lucky it's maybe 3 to 6 times a year.  For a city that's as close as it is to where I live it's seems much further than it actually is probably because of the traffic up the 410 which is practically a deterrent to want to drive there.  I actually asked somebody if Main was was extension of Hurontario because I really had no clue.

Because of my clear lack of experience with this city I hardly make the trip.  For some reason I think that may change and if it will I would have to say it would probably be because of this place.

I ended up ordering a Hop Bot, some fiery crispy Nashville style chicken wings and the Bob and Doug burger.  

The bar side is more than adequate for a good number of people and the lighting and decor is done tastefully.  This place gives me the feeling of being easy on the eyes while not being out of date.  I like the modern look to the place while it seems functional, esthetically pleasing and comfortable all at the same time.  

The wings came out first and I shared them with several others.  For some they seemed rather spicy but for me and a few of the others who are more accustomed to spicy hot they seemed rather mild but tasty.  They had a side squeeze bottle of tasty hot sauce that has flavor and tang, not just heat.  I really liked these wings.  I'm used to battered but these are crumb breaded, dry not saucy and it's a nice texture change to your every day crunchy heavily battered or even lightly battered or naked wings.  

I am already a fan of this place based on how they cooked their chicken wings and if you know me, fried chicken is a staple of mine and I have to say this place does it differently than most and they are very good.  

The burger choice I selected was actually the same choice as 2 others at our table so the 3 of us all ordered the same burger but everybody had a different side.  I had asked for  mine with shoestring fries.  The burgers are served on a plank and is described as follows, \"Peameal bacon, maple glazed double smoked bacon, crispy Vidalia onion ring, Ontario cheddar maple mayo on a pretzel bun.\"

So... that description is essentially 19 words, 3 commas and a period.  That ranks right up there as the most efficient use of 19 words I've ever seen.  Of course it's not like the establishment can or should write a Declaration of Independence document to describe this thing but I get it.  They just have to say what's in it.  How you perceive it after the fact is up to you.  If not for fried chicken I can safely say I love my burgers.  This Bob and Doug description is IMO probably the most underrated and simplistic description of a burger I've read in comparison to what the end product is.  Unassuming?  Umm, ya?  

Bob and Doug of course is in reference to the McKenzie brothers.  I will tell you what it's like in a not so humble way without only telling you what the burger's parts are made from.  This burger to me is the cultural epitome of a Canadianized burger.  There, I've said it.  I don't give such specific praises to great burgers because while there are countless establishments in the GTA nevermind the entire continent but what makes up this burger and how it's put together to me is what makes J. Red stand above some of my other 5* burger loves in which to date there are only 4 that are still around for me.  

Still this version from J. Red is simply the most Canadian version of this food to date for me and just because it is so patriotic isn't what makes it great.  Bacon on bacon?  Yes that's been done but the maple and maple with bacon and bacon is a double/double.  Granted sure the vidalia onion is help from the great state of Georgia but what an amazing choice.  

This burger will drip a bit.  It's juicy and the soft pretzel bun is probably perfect to balance out this burger.  The overload of meat and insides require such a bun with the kind of structural integrity that can be had with a durable but fresh pretzel bun so kudos for that decision.  Honestly I'm more partial to brioche but it's probably too light for this heavy requirement.  

While I'm not really a fan of non-McDonald's shoestring fries because many places don't do a good job, J. Red's shoestring fries are good.  To start off they are piping hot fresh when I received them.  That in itself believe if or not if a challenge for many places.  LONG fries, not itty bitty pieces but long, hot, skinny strings of sunshine.

This burger alone to me is worth the drive to Brampton.  Thankfully the government is widening the 410 right?

Our server Sonya made myself and the others feel quite welcome and was very attentive and friendly.  In the end the service was beyond great.

So with a tasty wings, an exceptional burger and great service to me J. Red & Co. is an easy 5.  If anything it probably sets a new standard for my favorite burger.

J. Red & Co. will be my first review to make both my fried chicken and burger lists."}
{"text":"This place is the missing piece of the puzzle in Brampton's food revolution in recent years. The restaurant reminds me a lot of places I have visited in Queen West or King West, but it is in my own backyard. 

I have visited for both brunch and lunch, and I am hooked. I have never seen a restaurant with this much of a unique approach to brunch. It is refined while also being a foodie's fantasy in bold flavors. 

I highly recommend trying the Creole Brisket Ball, Meat wood oven pizza, and the peanut butter pie! Brunch wise, I am a simple guy that is content with the quality in the Usual Suspect, but friends I have gone with spoke highly of the Eggs Diablo and Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"In my opinion over hyped and over priced. Food was good, service was okay. Seating very uncomfortable. Tiny portions for the price- I know they're trying to be fine dining - but not quite. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last Friday for a dinner. We ordered Indonesian fried rice (one of the special menu) and kale&quinoa salad. The food was okay and the price was still reasonable for the quality and quantity that we got. Brittany served our table and she was very friendly and helpful. I hope J Red & Co will maintain this good quality and dining experience."}
{"text":"We had such a hard time picking a meal from the menu. Every dish looked terrific. So we opted for 3 apps and a pizza, The \"prawn-cess\" and nothing disappointed. The salt and vinegar popcorn shrimp was fun and delicious. Comes in a popcorn bag with popcorn.  Creative. The Mac and cheese samosas were crazy good. The brisket bombs, Fantastic! The pizza was great. So great we offered to share with the neighbouring table and they of course said yes. The menu has all the staples with a twist. Go! Today! Next time We agreed we would do the prime rib special if they have it and the Thai fighter. Saw them at out pizza loving neighbours table and they looked Delish."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Caesar salad was excellent. Spicy noodles was totally perfect. Not so hot that you couldn't eat it. Finally the banana bread was delicious.  You gotta give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A nice modern ambience to give it oomph. Very friendly staff. However, I didn't quite enjoy the recommended special on a Tuesday lunch.

Tried to find the positive side of things and could only come up with the ambience and customer care. Still cannot remember the name of what I had.

My friend doesn't eat pork and accidentally ordered the special which had pork. The server described the entire entree but did not mention that the eggs were coated with pork sausage. He forgot to check as well. When we brought it to their attention, the server was very quick to replace the meal. The only drawback was that it was charged in the bill anyway. A little courtesy customer care would have been nice to omit the charge or give a discount on the wasted meal.

This restaurant will be an acquired taste."}
{"text":"Staff and the food is amazing here!! I had my birthday celebration here with a group of about 25. We had the set menu, it was snack style. Food was amazing!!! There was so much variety and flavors were so good. I'm vegetarian so the set menu was changed before hand to include more veggie options.  They accommodated many other requests in the group (vegan, dairy free etc.).The pizza was sooo yummy!!! Staff was very helpful and accommodating from the beginning. The servers were AMAZING. They kept the cake in the freezer and even packed the left overs for us. Thank you for an awesome night!"}
{"text":"When in Brampton, you could do a lot worse than J. Red & Co. We came in a group of 7 for lunch on a Saturday afternoon just before 1pm. Staff were warm and inviting. 

If you try anything here, it HAS to be the chowder, probably one of the tastiest I've ever had. There were salmon, shrimp, and mussels on the shell for a very delightful experience. 

The \"meat\" pizza was good, it's wood fired, but the bottom of the crust wasn't as crispy as you'd think. The cod tacos were okay, could've been crisper. The Caesar salad was overdressed, but had good croutons and parm. Not sure of it was just because of the large group, but some dishes were not as hot as others. Probably would've been better if the dishes came out as they're made rather than to the table all at the same time. You might be better off eating with less people.

5/5 for the chowder, 4/5 for atmosphere, 3/5 for the brunch dishes and tacos."}
{"text":"I am a fan of chicken wings and also a fan of Nashville Hot Chicken, so when I saw that J. Red & Co had Nashville Style Wings on their menu I had to try it.  I was very disappointed.  J. Red & Co uses frozen wings.  The wings had that distinct after taste you get from frozen wings that weren't properly thawed, and the chicken bones were grey.  This may be OK for most customers but not for wing fans.  I couldn't stomach it and I could barely get through half of their wings.

The rest of their food is fine and their staff is very friendly.  Although I wouldn't avoid this place in the future, I won't be ordering their wings."}
{"text":"Great food!. Reasonably priced. Service lacked just a bit, not sure if worth even mentioning because it was quite busy, but amazing food.  Was our first time but won't be the last that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I visited J.Red & Co on a Friday night with very high hopes. There was a long wait but we were invited to sit at the bar until our table was available. The hosts were both very pleasant, professional, and polite. When our table was ready, we were seated and decided to order the mac and cheese samosas. These were awesome and if I was in the area, I would totally drop in for more of these! I ordered the Crispy Eggplant and Cheddar Stack sandwich as my main, and it was alright. The flavours of the sandwich were good, but not one part of the sandwich was crispy. It was mushy. The others in my party ordered steak (well received), chicken (slightly dry), chicken and waffles (very pretty, but a little too sweet for this person's taste), and the thai fighter (well recieved). The service was pleasant and friendly, but a little slow especially for 9pm, when the restaurant is emptying out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try J. Red & Co for our anniversary. When we walked in we loved the set up and the vibe. Our waiter was extremely nice, informative and was great dealing with my boyfriends shell fish allergy (not deathly allergic) even though they serve that food. They pour you water for you right away, took our drink orders which we actually got really fast and took our food orders, we order the chicken and waffles and when we did he informed us that it was spicy and made sure we could take the heat. Nothing worst then being surprised that he too spicy for you to eat! Our food ended up taking awhile because the waffle machine decided it wasn't gonna work at that moment so to make up for it they brought us a salad free of charge! It was actually a great salad, even my boyfriend ate it and he doesn't like salads. Once we got our food it was fantastic, totally worth the wait. Half way through I saw there was sangria which I love so we ordered a pitcher, best sangria I've had so far! It was so yummy! Once we were done our food, he asked what we wanted for dessert and told us it was on the house because it was our anniversary, very thoughtful! We got the Nutella pizza since I was dying to try it and of course it was delicious. Totally worth the price and the service, this place was amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice location, interior is modern basic. Could be warmer but interiors are a matter of taste.

Good food selection. Had the chicken and waffles and the bob & Doug burger.  Both were great! Made crash, hot and were tasty. Good VFM!!

Our server- heather? Was absolutely amazing. Polite, friendly and humorous!  Shared plates were split on our bills without us having to ask - just great.  Kudo's to our server.

I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. It's been a long time coming that the west end gets more reliable, casual go-to restaurants where you can undoubtedly say, yes, the food's decent too. Sadly, this isn't the spot for us - unfortunately, regrettably, despite looking forward to a nice Friday evening meal, the food here fell pretty flat.

Normally, I base a review on the overall picture (food, service, ambiance). But unfortunately, our meal here was so tasteless, overtly mediocre and lacklustre that, these 2 stars are pretty much a reflection of the food. Coupled with the price point, the meal left us pretty disappointed. First, the Chicken & Waffles (at $21) was a bit of a disaster. The waffles were so soggy and overly soaked in its savoury sauce that when you cut into them, they actually completely fell apart. I was basically eating rice and chicken, if I went by texture. Second, the Bog & Doug burger was as hard as bricks, and a bit lukewarm in the middle, which makes me wonder if the meat was frozen and just re-heated. Plus, the menu said the burger came with a \"crispy Vidalia onion ring\"... first world problems jokes aside, where was the onion ring? It wasn't in it! On the plus side, I loved the shoestring fries. While it was definitely over-salted, I don't mind salty fries (hence, my trip to McDonald's after this meal). Lastly, our Nutella pizza was decent. Although, at $9? Not quite sure it was worth that price point.

On a positive note, our server, Dain, was sweet and fantastic, and saved what would have solely been a downright terrible meal. Great, friendly service. Also, the restaurant is set in a fantastic, large open space, which is great for big groups. But, unfortunately, that's where the positives stopped for us. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $57.00 (keep in mind, that's with no drinks)."}
{"text":"If I were to crave casual dining with an upscale downtown feel in Brampton, I would definitely head over to J Red & Co.  Once you enter, you no longer feel like you are in Brampton.  Great decor and the food is fantastic.  The food is flavourful, good portions and they have a good variety.  The staff are friendly.  The only issue is the location and view if you are by a window, but I do believe that this would not deter this business from striving.  The interior is inviting and cozy.  As mentioned, the food is fantastic!!! They also have craft beers. Furthermore, put your mind at ease as there's also a parking lot. I'm sure that this place will be a mainstay in downtown Brampton.  Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but I do not find the menu too interesting. Despite this, I'm giving this 1 stars because of the terrible service I experienced - one of the worst services I have ever received at a restaurant. To give a little backstory, I have been here a year ago and the whole experience was amazing but after my last visit I will not be returning. We arrived at around 9pm on a Friday night and the dining room was pretty dead. We were one of two small tables and there was another party of around 10 leaving. We ordered our drinks shortly after we arrived and around 10 minutes after being seated we were did not have menus or water glasses, so I asked the host for them and only received water glasses. I ended up getting the menus myself from the host podium for our table 5 minutes later. Another 10-15 minutes had passed and in this time frame our server had only come to our table once to take our drink orders. I asked the host to take our food order as we were short on time and yet to be served and he did. The food was okay but overpriced in my opinion. I cannot say the service will be horrible every time but the whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth. Wouldn't recommend this place to my friends or family anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed that I might make the trip up to Brampton just for this. 

After an amazing Yelp Elite Event held here, I decided halfway that I was already going to stay behind to have more of the deliciousness I had experienced. Our server, Sonya was ah-maaazing. She was very sweet, taking care of our needs while making sure all our orders were coming on time.

We all ended up ordering a variety of items from the menu. I probably had the most 'boring' one because I was recovering from being sick, but it was far from boring to me. I had the soup of the day, which was a cream of celery with bacon. Wow, it was so flavourful and they definitely did not use those fake af bacon bits that barely cost a dime. I was pleasantly surprised to find thick chunks of bacon in a creamy soup that did not stink of celery. 
The boys mostly ordered burgers, which was the biggest, most intense and meatiest burger I've ever seen. With thick slabs of bacon and a juicy beef patty, it was every man's dream. I thought it'd fall apart in 0.2s but the pretzel bun held it's own throughout every bite the boys sank their teeth into. Impressed! Lambert P. had these shoestring fries that reminded me a lot of my favourite fries of all time - Mickey Dee's! They looked so good that I almost forgot I had a sore throat and wanted to grab a bunch to shove down my throat. Almost. Cherrie T. had these mac and cheese samosas that I just could not resist. I had to take a bite of one of the most interesting dishes I had ever heard of and I was not disappointed. It's exactly what it offers. And who can forget Kris U. and his love for the thai fighter dish. It disappeared faster than anything else on the table. That dish must be spectacular in itself - the owner actually used all his determination to get the recipe from a legit thai guy with a mo-ped in thailand. How freaking cool?!?!?! 

Overall, it was a very enjoyable meal and the gorgeous restaurant that doesn't stick to any theme in particular. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for food and drinks. Had the eggplant sandwich with a beer on the first visit and the thai salad on the second visit. 

Enjoyed the first one a lot more than the second one for sure. The thai salad was way over dressed with sesame oil and not enough flavor. Love that they have more than 1 veggie option on their menu and their cauliflower tots are calling my name. 

The pricing is med to high depending on what you're ordering but the portions are pretty good. 

The service is decent with conversations and not all business. Didn't have a chance to check out their patio, but will try to swing by again before they close it up!"}
{"text":"Having been here on two separate occasions, I really have enjoyed the food. The first time I came here with a friend, the place was very busy but we both decided that seats didn't matter as much to us so we were promptly seated adjacent to the bar. Our server gave us the menus and explained the specials and we were on our way! We ordered the macaroni samosas, and I ordered the peppercorn steak cooked medium rare with gravy and fries. It was amazing, to say the least. My friend ordered I believe a burrito, and she had difficulties finishing it because it was amazing! I think my best memory of the place would be where we took the fries and spelled our names out on the boards that came with the food, but let me be honest, this is one of the greatest places Brampton has been gifted with, and though my schedule is busy.... I will have to so my best to revisit at a later date!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new (and hot) restaurant to check out and I came across J. Red. After looking at the menu I was personally convinced, sent it over to the boyfriend for approval and once he saw Mac and cheese samosas it was no contest. 
The restaurant itself is pretty big and the inside is a cool vibe, the bar is kind of sectioned off, cool art very \"Toronto\" feel. We did a reservation and it is a good thing! It completely filled up by the time we left. 
For apps we obviously got the Mac and Cheese Samosas which were completely delicious. The red curry ketchup they come with is awesome, now regular ketchup just won't do! The other app was the Green zucchini fritters. They were crispy perfection! Highly recommend these two apps.
For my main I got the Crispy Eggplant and Cheddar Stack (crispy fried eggplant with smoked cheddar, vine tomato chutney, onion sprouts and chickpea relish on cranberry multi grain focaccia bread) sans cheese. It is a small portion which works fine for me, but would probably not fill most people up (so get an app or dessert!). The bread it came on really made the sandwich. 
My boyfriend got the Bob and Doug burger - pemeal bacon, maple glazed double smoked bacon, crispy Vidalia onion ring, Ontario cheddar maple mayo on a brioche bun. I don't eat meat but I will admit it looked epic (refer to pics) and he confirmed it was the best burger he has had as far back as he can remember. Also, there was a woman at the table beside us that got the same and I overheard her saying it was the best burger she had ever had in her life. 
For dessert I was a bit disappointed. I was pretty excited and got the Smashed Lemon - warm short crust cookies with house made lemon meringue, toasted coconut and sweet lemon candy. Yah nothing was warm at all! What a let down. It was a celebratory dinner so I was totally all in for dessert but it tasted like cookies straight from a box :( 

All in all I am still giving a 5 star for their inventive menu that tastes as good as it sounds and great customer service."}
{"text":"This is a nice new place in Brampton.  A great variety of food options and in a good location that needed something new and fresh.  

Service was good and food was great.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The higher the price for food, the higher my expectations and the stricter my ratings are when it comes to the quality and taste of the food. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the laid back atmosphere with the TV set to sports bloopers, decor (which felt like a fusion of rustic with it's use of wood, and industrial with it's cement floor and exposed ceiling), and outstanding hostess and wait staff: the hostess didn't flinch when I asked to be moved from a tiny table for two to a roomy high top table for six (we were willing to share with another party if it got crowded). Sonia, our waitress, was superb: hospitable, knowledgeable of the menu, accommodating of our requests and all with a warm smile and great attitude. The menu is a bit on the pricey side but I did enjoy some of the flavor profiles.

WE TRIED:
- Marrow and Cheese Garlic Bread - \"Slow Roasted marrow with garlic butter and covered in house cheese blend\". Very rich and heavy, make sure to share. Bread had the mouth feel and chew of a thick flat bread; I enjoyed it.
-  Angus Beef Satay's \"10oz of angus beef strip loin, marinated and skewered, fire grilled and served on top of spicy pineapple fried rice with bok choy\". Tasty beef but no peanut sauce to be found on it nor on the side, the spicy pineapple fried rice left a nice tingle in my tongue but was too heavy on the soy sauce, and the bok choy was bland and waterlogged. Special note: ran across a few pieces of gristle and the meat had a chew like a skirt steak.
- \"Spicy southern\" chicken and waffles-  chicken breast (filet breaded with panko not batter), waffle and a spicy southern style smoked cayenne and brown sugar sauce topped with fried onion strings. The waffle was dense and got soggy quick, the rest of it was very tasty but rather oily. The spicy sauce was delish. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my time at J. Red and Co. and would definitely return if I was in the area. Would like to try out their new \"game\" menu with ostrich, venison, pheasant, bison and wild boar. Their tempting looking desserts would also entice me to come back."}
{"text":"Back again here today, sampling the Thai Fighter Pasta. I'm afraid I didn't think of taking a picture before i dove into the feast, but my oh my...was this a stellar dish!! Both, very generous in size and an explosion of a variety of flavors all in one. 
It's been several times that I have been here now...I cannot seem to find a dish that's just ok. Everything I've sampled here, and I am making some major dents into the offering, has been fantastic and out of this world!! And YES, the staff still rocks also!!
If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out. If you have, I'm sure you've become a regular!!"}

We decided to visit randomly after seeing their posts on Facebook about their new desserts. I will admit that it does not disappoint. Server Brett was incredibly attentive and very engaging. He brought us refills quickly and suggested menu items. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items and he made us feel welcome. We were a party of three adults and one two year old. The restaurant was very busy which was nice to see and they were nice enough to accommodate us. We had come out with  dessert in mind originally, but decided to try a few appetizers as well.
The honey garlic & hoisin sauce wings was delicious and were the two year olds favorite item. And to appease such a picky eater says a lot. 
The mini pork belly tacos were another hit all around, it was sweet with a hint of heat. The pork belly was a balance of rich flavours and moist pork belly, the crunch of the accompanying carrot slaw was exceptional. This was my personal favourite.
The Philadelphia cheesesteak egg roll was another amazing appetizer. Shaved pieces of steak and cheese nestled in a light egg roll wrapper that was accompanied by a sour cream like dipping sauce with a mild kick of wasabi rounded out this dish. It was my bfs favourite and had a milder flavour In comparison to the other dishes.
The butter chicken nachos were butter chicken over corn tortillas with the general nacho toppings of cheese, tomatos and green onions. This was different and enjoyed by everyone.
The crispy fried cauliflower wings were enjoyed by my bf and his sister, I absolutely despise cauliflower so I could not bring myself to try it. The only complaint was that it was a bit overly spicy.
For dessert I tried the cheesecake and it was phenomenal. My boyfriend had the Bailey's creme brulee and I snagged a bite of it, it was amazing! I have never seen my boyfriend order a second dessert in the many years we have been dating and this time he ordered a second creme brulee. His sister tried the stewed fruit pizza, it's a very large dessert that can be shared, she loved it and had leftovers for breakfast.
My boyfriend is not a fan of the Flying Monkey juicy ass beer and I was encouraged to try it... I found it to be horrific but it was fun to try something new. I had the sangria which was delicious as always."}
{"text":"I can't rate this .. the food was not up to par. The chicken and waffles were basically (chicken fingers and limp waffles)"}
{"text":"this place is hilarious, i'm not sure if my wife was there on an off night or what the deal is..

but she had a very lackluster dinner with her friend there and i told her to bring me food home.  she read off a few items on the menu and \"thai fighter\" sounded pretty good but she warned me it was extremely expensive, I believe $24.99+tax so about 30 bucks

When i got the box, I actually laughed out loud, I don't know if they had a child cooking or what but it was just a small portion noodles drenched in soy sauce with a bunch of non-deveined shrimps..  entire thing tasted literally like starch and soy

Take a look at the attached pictures and get ready to laugh

Thanks for the shrimp turds guys."}
{"text":"Five different breakfasts and all were amazing. Deep fried French toast, breakfast pizza, home fries all were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday night.  It was quite busy actually.  It was three of us grabbing a bite before heading downtown.

I ordered a burger and poutine, and it was average nothing to rave about, but nothing to hate on it.  My friend ordered the ceaser salad and some noodle bowl, which he did think was amazing. 

Are cocktails was good.

One of the big issues though was how slow it was for service.  Maybe it was really busy, as the server told us the bar was backed up, but still was beyond standard.  I been to extremely busy places and drinks came out faster.

I would though give this place a shot again though, with perhaps a different review.  Tuesdays are Oysters for a buck, which I could never find in brampton, so i will check it out"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service was good. And the chopped mango salad. It was filling. The OG pizza was good. Could have been crispier. Need to be back to try more items on the menu to real gauge. Recommend all to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Cute new joint...I'd definitely try it on a Friday or Saturday night. We went for brunch and it was quick and fast and the service was great.

Their dinner menu looks pretty good so definitely a place to try if you live around here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and when we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. Their decor is very urban, reminds me is downtown Toronto and their food is great. They had a good mix of all sorts of things including burgers, wood over pizzas and sandwiches. I had their beef dip sandwhich which has plenty of beef and a great horseradish mayo that gave it a nice kick. My partner ordered a bento box which allowed him to sample many other items on their menu. The bento comes with a soup, salad, sandwich, a few pieces of an app and dessert. He enjoyed the chowder and the Montreal smoked sandwhich. I also tried their brisket ball, it was filled with flavor. I think this is a restaurant Brampton has been missing and I see it becoming one of our favorites soon!"}
{"text":"So glad there's a place like this in Brampton. Unique menu... Everything on it is fantastic. Really great vibe."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate dinner there tonight. Nice ambiance and excellent service fro Stephanie. I had the cheese steak spring roll as an app. Delicious. My wife had an Asian salad which was also delicious. I had the beef rib and it was perfectly cooked and great. The only thing with my meal was that I ordered it with mashed and it came with fries which were good but slightly over salted. My wife had the Thai-fighter and she found it bland. Everything in the dish was however perfect cooked. I tried it and agree. It needed something Thai like fish sauce and maybe some Tamarind and lime maybe. Good experience overall. A bit on the pricey side but great food costs more. We'll be back. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Return visit last weekend, brought a friend for her birthday. She still can't stop talking about a Thai walnut and mango salad she had. 
I had the chicken and waffles. Still fantastic. Hard choice for me between that and Thai fighter which is not to be missed. 
I always end up with a doggie bag when I come here. 
There was a live jazz band playing that Sunday. Bonus! 
Another great evening, we will be back and spreading the word.  Lots more on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"So decided to eat here after the yelp event to try more items on the menu because the food was so good! As we get out Bob and Doug burgers omg it's definitely one of the best burgers and most filling burgers or all time! I had to sub a soup for my side because I was so full from early and it was deeelicious. Sadly I didn't finish the soup as the burger was the real money maker haha! 

Once again the service is one of the best service I've had in such a long time! Definitely a million out of 10! We had one of our friends burgers drop to the ground and no hesitation on a sorry and right back to kitchen. The mac and cheese samosas are definitely something to try! The fries are amazing omg definitely if you could get these fries they are on par with like all the great fries out there!! 

Definitely come here for your money's worth and then some!"}
{"text":"I had to check out J. Red & Co because it was getting such great reviews and I had a couple of friends who were raving about this place.  I am glad to say that they didn't disappoint. I had the Bob and Doug burger which was full of flavours and tasted amazing, but the item that truly made this place was the Nutella pizza which is a simple concept but it was so good. 

This will be one of go to spots from now on."}
{"text":"Nice appetizers. Had our wine served just before apps. Hubby found it very difficult to eat his because the portions were much too large for chopsticks and struggled with the food. Better laid out on a rectangular plate.
Overall the meal was fine. Will go back as they are changing the menu."}
{"text":"A little pricey but good food and great service!

We ordered the mac and cheese balls which to be honest could have been a little creamier. The chicken wings tossed in their house made honey garlic and oyster sauce was finger licking good! The peruvian tacos came in 6 and you build them yourself which is better than most restaurants. We also got a meat lovers pizza that could have been cooked longer. They also had a pretty decent drink menu.

Our server was great! She was attentive and food came out quick."}
{"text":"Lee and I had completed an 80k bike ride the day we visited, and to be honest, this was actually our second choice in town. Our first choice, Sul Irmaos, closes at 7 on Sundays, so to here we went.

This is kind of a funny place, decor wise. It has very trendy looks, outside and in, a bit upscale and we almost felt underdressed at first. We noticed that most of the other patrons were in casual wear so that wasn't really a big deal.

The slightly disappointing thing about this place is the limited draft menu. They only had macro brews (including their import of Estrella Damm, which sounds cool until you realize it's and adjunct lager, not much different from Blue or Bud,) on draft. Their focus seems to be much more on wine than beer. They actually have wine on tap, which is kind of an interesting concept.

They do have some micros in bottles, which is what we ultimately ended up with.

Some of the dishes on the menu made my eyes roll a little with their twee-ness (Thai Fighter pasta? Scoobi Doo Bolognese? UGH) but I will freely admit that I ordered the \"Eh'Loha\" pizza, which was a wood fired pineapple, ham, and bacon pizza. It was delicious, with a very thin, almost California-style (think, crispy cracker like) crust. 

Lee ordered Steak frites, which he really enjoyed as well.

So overall we really enjoyed the place, the service was friendly and very attentive, and although a little more pricey than our usual tastes, this would be a great place for a special meal."}
{"text":"I just visited this place for the Yelp leap year event this year and I was honestly pleasantly surprised. 

Located in Brampton with plenty of parking in a small strip mall, from the outside the place looks on the shall side. But upon entering it was actually more spacious then I anticipated, the layout has the bar to the left of the entrance which has a long narrow shape where as the dining room is to the right with ample space and tables.  The design is very fresh and modern, not cluttered and gimmicky I find the aesthetic welcoming but classy. 

I wasn't able to fully experience the full range of what this place had to offer as I had to leave for a family emergency but while there I was able to sample some incredible craft beer. Nice to know they have one of my all time favorite beers,Fruili! It's light and mildly sweet with a refreshingly clean after taste ... Seriously one of the best fruit beers I have ever had! 

The staff I found incredibly friendly and helpful, they seemed to handle the large crowd very well and were on point telling patrons about all the delicious treats rolling out of the kitchen, which as I mentioned was open concept. Very modern and clean the kitchen really seemed like a well oiled machine silently pumping out deliciousness. I will say that the bar is a tad on the small side but it is surrounded with Windows making it seem much less cramped then one would expect.

I most certainly will be back to try some fire oven pizza, I noticed it while chilling at the bar and was seriously intrigued. I shall be sure to update you as soon as I do with mouth watering pics too"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this new Brampton restaurant. It's a little out of our way but we wanted to try anyway. I ordered a German Beer \"Erdinger\" which was delicious. The only issue with this was the glass vas very dirty & it took some time for them to get a clean hit one back to me. 

I ordered the Prime Beef burger...which I can say was one of the \"MOST DELICIOUS\" burgers I've every had. It was soft, tasty & juicy. Just fantastic! Our servers was a very nice young lady that was attentive (except for the glass thing) & provided what we needed. This is definitely a do-over for me!"}
{"text":"Great meal had tonight at J. Red &Co. Server was very lovely. Started with the Asian chicken lettuce wraps. Delicious. Could have eaten 2 orders they were so good. Also, tried the special. Beef Tenderloin skewers over Japanese style rice with vegetables topped with fried wonton. It was delicious. They are thinking about trying it out on the menu. Portion size was excellent. Very nice taste and the wontons added a nice crunch. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"1st timers; 6 of us. Fortunately we had a reservation; crazy busy.  The atmosphere is school cafeteria meets Union Social Eatery.  Some tables were a little oddly placed but our's was great.
We started with Apps. The brisket bombs were really tasty; nice kick. The Caesar salad was a little dry but my husband quickly got some dressing in a cup.
The mains were awesome. Best \"Thai\" dish since being in Thailand. The burgers were awesome. The bolognese was \"comfort food\" at its best.
Really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back. 
The ONLY things we didn't like were the Caesar drinks (blah to look at and blah to taste) and the fact that you have to drink your wine from a glass tumbler like the water is served in.
But other than that well done \"J Red Co.\""}
{"text":"5 of us had dinner here on a Friday evening.  The food was OK - the steaks were good & the sauce on them had a bit of zip, the pasta was good, the fish had a ton of bones in it which surprised us, the King pizza (white sauce, mushrooms, red pepper, feta) was the worst choice - way too many toppings for the thin crust.

This restaurant is a wide open room, fairly large, brightly lit.  There are tables of all sizes, shapes and heights.  The table we were seated at had the most uncomfortable metal chairs - all of us commented on it.  Our reservation was at 7:00 and it seemed like the restaurant \"cleared out\" before we wrapped up at about 9:15.

5 entrees + 1 side veg dish, reasonable bottle of wine, 2 juice was $190 + tip."}
{"text":"Great food , friendly service, alittle on the expensive side but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Will keep my review short and simple. Came with friends, had a beer and ate the meat pizza. The size of the pizza was decent, toppings appropriate, and all in all delicious! Friendly waitress who checked in on us every now and then, and prompt service. Had a good time, and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pricy for the portions but the food is very good. Beer selection needs more variety (craft beer) which would bump my rating up. I had a hard time picking a meal as so much sounded good. Had the Thai Fighter and it was super. Waitress was great."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was really surprised by J Red.  Brampton spots havent been consistent or bring in the flavour from my experiences but my lunch here was enjoyable.  If anything, I would say the service I had was one of the best 905 restaurants experiences from memory.  The service is what makes J Red a 4 star over the other GTA West options that are pretty good.  Food isn't bad (3.5 stars) but definitely the service make this a solid good option for Brampton.

J Red & Co is a modern bar ... seeing how their food is not pushed aside for drinks, maybe I'll call it a gastropub.  The place is quite big with a large bar area that has unique eye catching tiling, a good patio that goes into the parking lot, and a good sized dining space that have huge communal tables or booths to suit your needs.  The feel of the space is relaxed and fun... the posters and decor points to a tongue in cheek humour.  If anything, the kids menu tells the whole story and probably make you crack a smile.  Before I forget... place is clean and spotless which is always a nice thing to triple check before sitting down.

As I mention, service here is really good.  Excellent really.  Our server was all smiles and she knew the menu so well.  Not only was she proactive in letting us know the specials, she even suggested some of the favourites and ways to combine their sets so we wouldnt have to buy extra sides.  I dont remember the last time a server was so helpful in my order in the GTA... usually is an 'uh huh' and run.  Also, I loved how she kept a quiet constant view of our tables so the moment we were done, plates were cleared, and she checked in on us to make sure our food was good.  

The menu is definitely eclectic ... it takes from every influence and puts them on the menu.  It has your common bar food but it just tweaks it so it's unique to J Red.  I really admired how they had Indonesian food on the menu.  Nasi Goreng and Lumpia?  Really... well that's pretty awesome.  They do have your true Canadian bar food.. burgers, pizza, pulled pork, and wings.  BUT if you're willing to venture into new territory, they got a new sauce for you to try on those wings ... hoisin or mango & passionfruit BBQ.  

Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower - A vegetarian take on buffalo wings.  I found these to be a decent rendition on it.  It feels like a beer batter so it wasn't super light but it was crispy enough and freshly hot of the fryer.  Then it was sauced up good with a super mild sauce.  I'm not sure how they can call this spicy but I guess it does have spices.  It could have used a few notches of heat added to even bring it to a medium.  The sauce does lend itself towards the sweeter side.  I dont need it to be sweet but I guess the locals like it this way.  For the dish, its a pretty decent app but if I come back, I'd probably try other items.  3.5/5  

Pulled Pork Sandwich  - If you see the pictures, you'll see the sandwich just drroooooooling in sauce.  A good generous portion of pork was just drenched in sauce.  I think eating this with some semblance of manners may have proven a bit challenging ... sauce dripping everywhere, pork slipping around... I think a few napkins is necessary to handle this one.  Taste wise, it wasn't bad.  All you taste is the sauce and not necessarily the pork.  It could have been a bit punchier with the salt or pepper... something.  It was a polite demure sauce... for pulled pork, it could have been bolder. 3.5/5

Tomato Coconut Soup - This was interesting... at first I was like 'wut' but after trying it, I realized it's a slight nod to the South East Asian curries.  I dont normally see this in most spots but I think some homecooked meals I've had in Thai homes had a similar flavour.  Either way, it rich and creamy.  You definitely taste the coconut flavour and tomato.  I didnt get much else beyond that.  Nice little twist.  I'm not sure if everyone would love it but it definitely gets a thumbs up for originality.  3.5/5

Chopped Salad - a decent sized salad that combined a lot of different vegetables with a crunchy tortilla topping.  I feel salads need a crunch so I did like it.  I found the sauce to be quite mild ... It didnt really have much flavour but thankfully there was a lot of different vegetables to add to the flavours.  I liked how it was just wasn't a boring salad but rather it was different from a typical caesar.  3.5/5

As for the beers and ciders, they have an impressive variety.  I spotted a lot of great local Toronto & Ontario options that are really good. I also liked how they're reasonably priced and not some crazy mark ups like Toronto.

I feel J Reds definitely is one of the better GTA West restaurants I've been to because that service is just great.  Food wise, I think they have a lot of promise... lots of interesting twists and ideas on the plate.  I think they can try to bump up the flavours to be bolder and then you'd have the flavours matching the service for a great 4 star spot."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5 star.  I came here Sunday evening and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe 5 tables were occupied at most.  Waiter was friendly and very attentive.

The food I must say was average.  Found this place through Yelp and read all the great reviews and saw all the amazing photos.  To be honest I think this place was hyped way too much.  We had ordered Mac n Cheese Eggrolls, Smoked Cheddar and Creole Crab Dip, and got the Thai Fighter to share.

Mac n Cheese Eggrolls was nothing special.  It was a little dry, and it did lack that creamy-ness, and cheesy-ness a Mac n Cheese should have.  The Smoked Cheddar and Creole Dip was average nothing I haven't tasted before.  However, I did enjoy the homemade chips they used instead of bread.  Thai Fighter is J. Red's signature dish and I did not see anything signature about it.  I mean it was good but again, it was nothing special.  I've had and tasted better.  I should've gotten the Chicken and Waffle dish instead but decided against it as everyone seemed to like the Thai Fighter so I thought I'd give it a go and see what all the rave was about.  Totally regret that decision.  Also, the Thai Fighter says it's spicy on the menu...it is not spicy at all, maybe a little tingle on the tongue but nothing more.  Trust me, take it from someone who can't handle eating super spicy foods.

Overall, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.  It was a good experience but the food wasn't memorable enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Oven fired pizza great beer selection. Great over allexperience. Lots of seating"}
{"text":"Really good food, and the music was exceptional (live band was good!). I ordered the butter chicken risotto, it was a little overpowering in the spice department, but good. 

The reason for 3 stars was our waitress was rude though, we had the blond younger female. I would have given this place a 5 star otherwise. All of the other servers were really sweet, they smiled greeted us when we came and left, really welcoming. Even the musician came up and talked with us on his break. We were ordering drinks and she didn't accept our Michigan and Puerto Rico ID card, which is understandable, I got it, but the way she handled it was rude. She was cold, no smile, nothing, no apology, nothing. Then we hear from behind the bar her complaining saying \"who brings a Puerto Rico and Michigan ID? I'm not serving that\". So we just the lukewarm water out of the dusty cups that had been sitting on the table for god knows how long. 

I understand we forgot to bring our passports to dinner, but sometimes just being nice or giving us a smile goes a long way. We're obviously on a trip, from a different country, exploring. It was just handled poorly. After that point she just seemed rushed and just trying to get us out."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews this place was intriguing.  In Brampton there isn't much places with a nicer decor. I love the local artwork on the wall.  The wait staff was also friendly and inviting.  We had lunch there but there wasn't much of a crowd. I don't know why. It was a great place to enjoy the atmosphere. We had a couple of dishes including the fish and chips, Bob and drug burger, aloha pizza, and pesto pasta. The pasta was forgettable.  Not bad but nothing special. I wish they had a rare burger like in the states.  That would have made it so much better. The fish and chips and pizza w as delicious"}
{"text":"The staff are attentive. The food is fresh and flavourful. The atmosphere is vibrant. And the drinks don't stop flowing!  I've been here a few times and haven't had a disappointing experience yet. It's great to see that Brampton still has a few gems that sparkle in the dirt. (Bring back the mac n cheese samosas)"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I like how J Red & Co keeps improving on their menu and have interesting offerings constantly. 

Dropping by on a weekday evening and the place was quiet. Service was attentive and I enjoyed the laid back vibe.

We ordered 2 main and a side to share:

Chicken and Waffles
Spicy southern chicken and waffles- crispy chicken breast,savory waffle and a spicy southern style smoked cayenne and brown sugar sauce

Peruvian Tacos (No longer on the menu)
Spiced Peruvian Ground Beef, Flour Tortillas, Pico de Gallo, Chmmichurri sauce and smoked cheddar

Crispy Brussel Sprouts with double smoked Bacon and Parmesan

Food was A-OK but I did not find the food \"spicy\" but I can handle my spices well. Surprisingly, I enjoyed Brussel Sprouts the most compares to the other 2 dish.

Price point is on the higher side for a neighbourhood eatery but what they offers are quite unique."}
{"text":"Good service.  Creative menu.  Great food."}
{"text":"Burgers are great...Working my way through the menu. Don't like how the deserts come in buckets... Whatever happened to plates"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I wasn't impressed with the food at all . I had high expectations because the food is being cooked by an executive chef. We had the mac n cheese rolls which weren't served very warm , wasn't cheesy and really dry. For mains I had the mushroom gnocchi and my friend had the burger . The burger was very bland but the gnocchi was good nothing to be excited about . I decided to give the place a second chance with a group of friends and had the Cajun steak , which was cooked very well but again it was bland and could have been seasoned a lot better considering it was \"Cajun\" flavor. It was served with mashed potatoes that was amazing you could tell they were made from scratch . Overall the food is average and deff not worth the price , this place is pretty pricey ."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tuesdays are half off wine bottles! Ladies night Thursdays. I worked with Chef Jason Rosso before and Brampton is very lucky to have JRED&CO."}
{"text":"Food was flavourless. Had the mac and cheese and it was nothing special really. The ambiance of the place itself is nice though. My friends didn't think the food was anything special either."}
{"text":"Okay, so where do I start.
I've been there twice already and I still think the food is over-priced. 

First time I came here, I tried the Thai Street Fight, which was good.. But $19? Kinda excessive. Also had the Mac and Cheese Samosas, which were good. On the other hand, the fire n ice app, which is sushi.. Not so much. The rice on it is really thick and extremely chewy. The \"fire\" part which is probably pan fried was alright but the \"ice\" part was not. Did not enjoy that.

Second time I came here, it was on a Tuesday. Wanted to try their buck a shuck. Any way, they had a seafood menu for that day and I really wanted tacos. Two tacos for $15? And no side? Kind of disappointing. Oysters were alright.. Should have more options on sauces. 
Wish the presentation was also better. Why not invest in some stainless steel platters and an oyster fork. 

Any way, I will probably return. Tuesday is half price wine. Also, service is great here as well."}
{"text":"OMGGG, soooo damn good!!  Everything had so many different and interesting flavours, it was a really lovely surprise!  The tacos are delightfully fresh, their butter chicken nachos are surprisingly splendid, and everything else we ordered was filled with flavour!  I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Late entry. I tried eating here last year. I remembered eating the chicken and waffles. From what I remembered the chicken had good spice but wasn't amazing. The chicken came with a plain waffle. There was syrup to help balance the spice. It was a okay, I liked it. The dish is similar to other restaurants. I'd go back again though because their menu is eclectic."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch while up in Brampton. I wasn't originally going to visit. I remember thinking that the place looked like just any other neighborhood restaurant/watering hole from the outside when they first opened up. However, earlier this week a friend from work was mentioning how good and different the food was so the blond and I decided to try it. I'm so glad we did.
Our server, Dane was brilliant with the menu, great recommendations with descriptions of the dishes. He checked in often enough for us to know that we weren't being ignored and not so often that we felt rushed.He went out of his way to make sure that we were completely satisfied with our meals.
I had the seafood chowder as an appetizer. It was spectacular. The Thai Fighter was a very good Pad Thai dish with a wonderful blend of heat and flavour.The Blond's Classic Dip sandwich was delicious.
Finished off with cappuccinos and Nutella Balls for desert. Dane did a fantastic job on the cappuccino, perfect froth, best I've had in a long time. The Nutella Balls could have easily been split between 4 people as a desert and were delicious. We ended up taking half of them home with us along with the remaining dipping sauce.
The place was clean and comfortable with the decor funky and inviting. The service was fast and friendly. Dane made sure to let us know about special nights for seafood and Prime rib.
Even though we don't live in the area, we intend on checking out the seafood night in the near future; the food is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Been here twice and it's been awesome every time. The food and drinks are good, atmosphere is fun and they also have a live band sometimes! Definitely a try! 

Items to try: salt and vinegar popcorn shrimp, prime rib with mash (not on the menu but a special I think on Fridays), Tuesday buck a shuck (PEI oysters), prime rib burger and eh-loha pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with family. Food was awesome. Had the rib special. Probably the best ribs I've ever had. My wife had the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed them. They had a hint of lemon which she said took it over the top. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. This just became my got to restaurant in Brampton. 
Will be back for sure."}
