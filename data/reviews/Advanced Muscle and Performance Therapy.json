{"text":"I've been going to Stefanie for years. She is by far one of the best massage therapists I've ever had. She is professional, personable and always provides the right therapy based on what's going on with me physically. She has become an important part of my overalls health and I appreciate her for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Stephanie about 2 weeks ago and she was by far the Best Massage Therapist we've ever had! He had lower back pain and after the first session his back improved significantly. She is very knowledgeable and professional! We Highly recommend Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Stefanie is the best! Her professional and positive attitude are an absolute pleasure! Her massage and FST experience and skills are second to none. You will not regret an appointment with Stefanie. Just make one already, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stefanie is very skilled at her craft. I struggled with muscle pain/ discomfort in my soais and gluteus medius muscles for 6 months. After the first session there was clear improvement. The location is very clean and comfortable. Visiting Advanced Muscle and Performance Therapy is an investment in your future health and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Stefanie gives the BEST deep tissue massage you will ever get!!  I have gone to her for years! Her strength, knowledge and expertise of knowing exactly what to do to cure my pain or just to unwind me have always amazed me. She has and will always be my TOP recommendation! But beware, once you go to her you will be spoiled for life and will never find anyone else who does it any better!!!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and Stefanie is incredible. The work she did on my shoulder helped tremendously with the pain and the overall feeling the following days is wonderful. I wish I could go every week to get the combination of full body relaxation and muscle work done."}
{"text":"If you need an amazing therapeutic, deep tissue massage to help relieve stress or discomfort from hitting the gym or just from life, this is where you need to go!

Stefanie is amazing massage therapist that fixes whatever happens to be strained on me at the time. I show up, hunched over and stiff; I leave upright and ready to hit another Bootcamp session.

One of the nicest, most pleasant people you'll ever meet, Stefanie is a master of her craft."}
