{"text":"Clean, welcoming and wow.

$7.95 for a lunch with soup.  Amazing.  Nice find on a road trip.

Food is delicious.

Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious, and the service is friendly without being at all imposing. The ambience is minimal but you immediately forget where you are because everything else is a treat."}
{"text":"Review for Pho Special.

Appearance: 1/10
Soup: 1/10
Noodles: 7/10
Meats: 3/10
Portion: 3/10

I'll give 9/10 for cleanness and server was very nice 

Overall: 3/10

One of the worst pho I had, It could taste better if I tried at home. Please do not call yourself Viet restaurant if you can't even make pho. Would not come again."}
{"text":"I tried mango salad, pad thai, and fresh pineapple salad in lunch hour. You have a lot of options on the lunch special menu and the size are pretty large."}
{"text":"Ordered three items for takeout and they all tasted delicious. Can really taste the freshness in the chicken pho, very flavorful soup too. Garlic beef had a great portion and taste. Love the Lemon chicken, it was done to the right crispy without being too oily. Thank you for the great dinner, husband and I liked it very much!"}
{"text":"Today we had a huge order (12 dishes) for lunch specials for a group of coworkers and again this little restaurant totally delivered some bold flavours! It took a little longer to get everything ready (that's on us) because we only called at 11:35am to order all 12 dishes so I know their kitchen was hectic and busy pretty much for the next hour! But eveyrthing was organized and everyone got what they ordered :) The chef even brought the food out to the car for us because it was such a heavy order and they apologized for making us wait! Very kind of them to accomodate such a last minute large order, but next time we are definitely going to place the order a day ahead so they have more time to prepare. 

While we were waiting we noticed some customers ordering the pho noodles. So far I've only tried their Thai food (and again the food flavours are amazing and bold, and for 7.95 you are getting way more than your money's worth in terms of portions!) but I'm looking forward to try their Viet food sometime in the next few weeks!!

Definitely a regular here going forward and they will be getting some good business from the local area (particularly at the hospital :))"}
{"text":"Pho soup is smooth and light, no MSG taste, and the beef is very tender. My friend ordered Spicy Basil, juicy and delicious. We Will come again!"}
{"text":"I had the Thai Roasted Curry Duck and it was so good! I would highly recommend this tiny restaurant with a wide variety of options. The food tastes better than many of the high end Thai places I've been to around GTA."}
{"text":"We ordered the Thai lamb curry and the pho house special. The pho was at most average compared to other Vietnamese cuisines' pho we've had in pickering; noodles, meat, soup, everything was standard for 9$. For the Thai lamb curry, the lamb tasted very fresh and tender and was deliciously prepared in Thai fashion, but the curry was a bit watery and wasnt spicy at all like it was advertised. I also believe that the portions for the lamb were quite small for 15$. On a good note the restaurant food definitely exceeded my expectations when we first saw the exterior and interior of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. The owner is so welcoming and they have amazing take out specials that are easy on the wallet.

We have had the spring rolls, which are handmade and their green curry - so delish!

The pad Thai is really good too. The coconut chicken soup is tres delish and if you have room S
You should definitely order it!"}
{"text":"Being and avid lover of Thai food I was pleasantly surprised to see another establishment with this type of cuisine open close to me. I got their flyer in my local mail, so i decided to check it out.

Durham does have some good Thai places already so the stakes and my expectations were quite high. 

First impressions weren't good, it's located in this old smaller strip mall. It's the kinda location that is stuck in the 80's.

Walking inside the interior is nothing to write home about. But i reserve judgement, since I didn't come to be dazzled by the ambiance.

The girl was very friendly at the counter and helped us out with our takeout order. 15 mins later we had our food and headed home.

We ordered the Veggie Lemongrass Rice,  Red Chicken Curry, and the Garlic Beef

The food was amazing!  Very flavourful! I now have another Thai place to go to in Durham. Well Done!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the little restaurant fool you, there are some big bold flavours coming out of here! I went with a group for the lunch special and we all ordered something different to try: pad Thai, sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken,  and golden curry. The lunch special comes with a choice of soup or mango salad. The starter wonton soup and mango salad were both excellent, but the mains were amazing! The golden curry had a rich coconut flavour with just the right amount of spice and curry.  The sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken had a crispy outside and great sauce.  The pad thai was also quite flavorful. This is somewhere to definitely check out if you're in Whitby."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I couldn't believe I missed this place with such high reviews.  My father and I have exhausted all the Asian restaurants in the area so this is a pleasant surprise.  It's a small place not very noticeable from the road.  Everything is seasoned in balance. The pad Thai is the exact sweet and sour you would expect in this traditional dish.  Try the dumplings app.  You won't be disappointed"}
