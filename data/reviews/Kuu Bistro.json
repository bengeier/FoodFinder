{"text":"I worked down the street from Kuu and for months this place was FULL during lunch time. So when my colleagues and I finally got a seat we were so ready to review this place ourselves.

After 20-25 minutes of waiting, the first 2 dishes arrived but the 2 orders of ramen were no where to be seen. 5 Minutes later, our waiter brings us a bowl of free bowl of  ramen because they had an extra order and didn't want to waste it. AWESOME!

5 minutes later he comes to apologize because the second half of the order didn't make it through(?) and offered us complimentary drinks. I wasn't even mad because the free bowl of ramen was delicious.

When my ramen came, I already knew what to expect. Perfect noodles, flavourful broth and the portion size was just right. $10 for a large bowl of delicious ramen. I'm happy with that.

Though they lost our order, the waiter was courteous, admitted the mistake and offered something in return. 

Would definitely come back and try other items on the menu... if I can get a seat."}
{"text":"The place is so full of shit! Don't even consider to eat there! The staff doesn't even know what they are doing! They charge you the tips without telling you is a suggestion! We came at 8pm and left at 11pm because it took a eternity to bring us the food! They shouldn't have any star at all! They gonna go bankrupt with this kind of service they are giving!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. The food is served in small portions that are low quality and over priced. Their menu is a weird mix of things that are doused in sauce without any of the classic sushi, sashimi and maki."}
{"text":"Propreté des salles de bain négligée.
Le deuxième étage ne semble pas entretenu du tout.
Pas de permis d'alcool lors de notre visite en février...
Serveuse qui ne parle ni ne comprend le français. Elle trouve également drôle de voir des clients s'offusquer de ne pouvoir obtenir d'alcool qui quittent.

La nourriture est par contre très bien."}
{"text":"As many izakaya around the town, Kuu Bistro offers a menu of ramen and japanese style small dishes. For 25$, you can get a reasonnable dinner, just enough to not feel bloated. If you have a good apetite, go there at supper time to try there all you can eat sushi menu for around 27-28$.
The taste was good, but not enough to blow your mind or make you crave for more.

The good thing i liked about this place is that if you want to organize a big group event, you can reserve almost the whole second floor for a private party, which is hard to find. We were around 30 people and there was enough place to have 20 additional guests. It's a good solution if you want to hang out with lots of friends and move around to talk to them.

Here's some tips:
1) Reserve in advance if you have a big party group.
2) Sometimes, pictures on the menu can be misleading. For instance, if you see 2 eel skewers on the menu, it's actually 1. And if you share a table with friends, they will put all the orders in the same dish, which might be super confusing.
3) If you are vegetarian, you might actually want to go with the all you can each sushi menu or he vegetarian bento box."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Fish pieces are really thin, however if you go all you can eat, you just order more.
I did like the variety they offered, many of the fish I'd never had in sushi rolls before. 
Service was a little cold and  their beef dishes were not the greatest. The beef tasted old."}
{"text":"This place is the worst! Really unprofessional! I go there on a saturday night for a table of 3. The food is ok not superb. The girl who served us gets distracted because she sees her friends at the window and totally forgets about us! 

Our meals come in the wrong order when my cousin is still waiting for her food and she ordered sashimi when i ordered ramen! Cmon!!!! U gotta be fucking kidding me!

As for the bill, its all separate bills and the only thing i wanted split is the dessert in 2 and she couldn't even do that! The bills were all wrong and we didn't want to tip her. She had the audacity to ask for it... HELL NO! Bunch of posers who do not know a thing about running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!
Not \"traditional\" with the ingredients but delicious and full of flavors. 
The service can be a little slow on rush hours, but it's definitely worth the wait!
Went there twice during a 6 days stay and would go again in a second. 
Also the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"OK service, portions are decent, prices are fine. Will eat again at this place. We suggest you make a reservation because the place tends to get crowded from five to eight."}
{"text":"La pire expérience sushis à vie. Sauce au ketchup et mayonnaise Heinz, impression d'avoir une boule de poile vomis par un chat dans la bouche! La majorité des sushis sont tartiné de fromage à la crème (sûrement pour donner du soutien).

Éviter!  

J'ai du poursuivre mon dîner dans un second restaurant pour terminer."}
{"text":"We were served very brown (bad smelling) tuna. For those who don't know, tuna (if it's fresh) should be a deep red or a pinkish color if it's from a fatty (more expensive) part of the fish. So I asked my server what is this, she didn't even know what fish it was so she asked another server who couldn't identify the brown smelly raw fish being served either! Finally we were told it was tuna, not just any tuna though, \"special\" \"expensive\" tuna they said. Nice try. Don't waste your time going here. They either don't know when to throw out bad fish or they don't care. Pass."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews. I came here recently with a friend for dinner and the service was friendly and quick, and the food was great. (My friend is not a sushi/raw fish fan and she was able to find plenty of options and ultimately left very full and happy.)

We were thrilled to learn they have a la carte items throughout the day (not just buffet), for decent prices (eg: traditional Japanese style bento boxes that come with miso soup, salad, rice, a sushi roll, and two entrees such as chicken teriyaki and tempura for $16). 

It's actually quite hard to find a restaurant in Montreal that serves these Japanese-style \"comfort foods\" (like ramen, chicken katsu, tempura, chicken teriyaki) for decent prices and decent atmosphere, so this will be my new go-to place! 

Plus, a nice outdoor terrace... What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food 3 out of 5
No happy hour specials?? Really ? For downtown Montreal
They claim to have specials Saturday night only after 21:30.....oh OK
Sake list is good , but no house sake
The place was empty
My vote is keep your no happy hour, no house sake , empty seats, and I'll simply go to one of the dozen other Japanese pubs in Montreal
Eaters seeking a fun hip place....don't bother
And the new thing of auto 15% tip on top of the taxes!!!!!
Nice"}
{"text":"I like this izakaya. The atmosphere is great and not too loud. Very nice decorations. The food is delicious. I love the Kuu llipop and beef tataki, yummy yummy. Also they have a bar. Me and my friends will go back again."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for lunch (bento box) with a colleague who ordered sushi. He got his sushi quickly but my bento box came an hour later, and they used the sushi preparation as an excuse.  Then the waiter offered 20% off, and was overruled by the cheapskate owner who only authorized 10%.  They were not apologetic, and not customer friendly.  I will never return. 1.5 HR lunch on a working Friday is not acceptable."}
{"text":"There was really really nice servers!!!! They might really take care of you! I and my brother were really moved about their kindness... And i love their food. You know, buffet can't be good at all. But this place was really good for me! (especially they give the belly of salmon! ) price is really reasonable. I'll visit here again as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Arrived at half hour before closing and they wouldn't give me anything. Why post your hours if you are lying about them. They said oh the kitchen has to clean up. Well in my general experience the kitchen cleans up after they're done serving guests come during business hours. They were very rude."}
{"text":"????????????????sashimi????miso soup???????signature roll?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"A good variety of dishes in this all-you-can-eat style restaurant. My friends and I were very amazed with the speed and food quality we got, based on the price we paid. We specially enjoyed the grilled salmon neck, stir fry beef cubes, white fish sashimi, mackerel sashimi, and oven baked oyster with spinach, cheese and creamy gravy."}
{"text":"My friend and I bought this amazing deal for Kuu Bistro located in front of Philips Square (near McGill metro). Hip, young and jazzy, this little izakaya certainly offers a nice suave ambiance.

Interesting items on our menu:
- PEI Oysters: metallic with an added zesty touch from the lemon - these were really fresh and delicious!
- Chicken, beef and pétoncles skewers (our personal favourite was chicken)
- White fish carpaccio
- Green Tea Ice Cream Rolled Pancake

I would definitely go back:
For a drink and some oysters
If I obtained another deal - but even without, I think the overall menu is decently priced or slightly above average
Kuu bistro is best for:
Parties of 2 to 6 friends
A perfectly balanced date or happy hour between classy and casual

{"text":"Okay, so I still come here to eat pork ramen. 

I have not found a better spot that is just as cheap, without a super long line (I cannot deal with a long line), and delicious.

Someone help me out here, because I can taste the ramen is just drenched in MSG and salt because after I eat here, I drink about 2 L of water..."}
{"text":"Great lunch !!! Amazing food !! Love the lunch and dinner boxes.  During the summer thy have a beautiful mini terrace also"}
{"text":"Like all the other AYCE sushi places in Montreal, Kuu is just fine. Not amazing and not horrible.

Large menu with lots of selection, fresh fish and other items, and usually good tasting pieces. That being said, it's really nothing to write home about.

Service is usually ok but I find that whenever we've sat in the upstairs section it's been much slower so try to sit on the main level if you can. Apart from this, I have no favorite items because they're all average, and neither anything I can advise you to stay away from. Go check it out for yourself - I don't think you'll be disappointed if your popping in for a casual no frills sushi dinner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"J'avais peu d'attente pour ce restaurant, car les serveurs du Seoul Chako, dont j'ai une opinion mitigée, m'ont indiqué que c'était les mêmes propriétaires qui avaient ouvert ce Izakaya. 

Décor : Ils ont deux étages, l'étage du haut semble mieux. Les bancs de bois sont moyennement confortables... Je ne sais pas pourquoi tous les Izakaya à Montréal se donnent le devoir de reproduire des bancs peu confortables... Les toilettes étaient propres. Ils nous ont mis sur le bord de la fenêtre, alors qu'il faisait -30, mais les places réservées n'étaient jamais comblées et finalement, l'étage du haut, que nous avons vu en allant à la salle de bain, était à moitié rempli. 

Nourriture: J'ai essayé les sashimis qui m'ont étonné positivement. Le saumon était dans une sauce ponzu et nous l'avons apprécié. J'ai pris de la pieuvre, croyant qu'il allait arriver sous la forme cuite (malgré que ce soit en sashimi) que nous avons dans les restaurants de sushis, mais non c'était crue. Pour l'expérience culinaire, ça valait la peine, mais c'est pas très appétissant du gris gluant de pieuvre. Ils ont une assiette de sashmis aux alentours de 13$ qui semblait très intéressante.  

Mon amie a pris des boules de pieuvre frits et du fromage frit. N'étant pas fan de friture, c'était mangeable selon moi, sans plus. Mon amie a apprécié le fromage, mais n'aimait pas le goût de la pieuvre frite. 

Nous avons également pris une soupe udon aux fruits de mer et un genre de bibimbap à l'anguille. Le bibimbap était correct, mais la soupe udon était décevant, car les fruits de mer c'était principalement de la goberge et un poisson frit. J'adore l'anguille, mais le reste de l'assaisonnement était \"fade\". Le positif, c'est qu'ils sont servis dans des portions généreuses. 

Ce qui semble intéressant, c'est qu'il offrait des huîtres que nous n'avons pas essayé ce jour là. Il y avait une promotion d'huître à 1$ le samedi après 21h30.

Il y a des images pour le menu. Ils offraient des makis sushis, mais ne semblaient pas spécialisés en sushis, alors nous n'avons pas essayés. 

Leur menu alcool était diversifié (cocktails, saké et bière japonaise). Il n'avait par contre pas la bière Kirin Ichiban offert sur leur menu. 

Service : On est allé un samedi soir et le restaurant n'était pas plein. Il y a eu un erreur dans notre commande en raison que le serveur n'a pas bien compris le numéro du plat en français... Sinon, le service était rapide, mais ils nous ont servi des petites entrées après la soupe et le bibimbap qui étaient pourtant des plats consistants. 
 
Prix: Le prix est abordable, mais chaque plat varie approximativement entre 7-13$. Alors la facture monte rapidement si on veut explorer le menu."}
{"text":"Cool ! J'y suis allé avec des amis et on a bien aimé. On a pris la nourriture qui vient dans une genre de boîte, c'est assez cool. Les sushis sont super ! Je recommande. Une étoile de moins car les toilettes sont super mais super petites et le robinet a que de l'eau glacé. Mais bon, j'y suis allé en 2016, peut être qu'ils ont rénové."}
{"text":"Pretty ok and cheap, especially at lunch time. The best option is to get a Bento box and try different sushi varieties, at less than 20 dollars. The service is always super nice."}
{"text":"I went to Kuu bistro for lunch and the staff and service there was awful. The guys i was with received their food in just over an hour and tables around me were getting the wrong orders with waiters trying to pawn the same dish off on a number of different people. I myself, waited an hour and a half for my food and it never came. Not one, but 2 waiters didnt know where my bento box  was (not hard to get right).

Then they said it would be made in 2 minutes and they would give me a 20% discount... then 10% discount and finally 15% because they were not authorized to do any better. Like rabbits from a hat they were pulling numbers from thin air but still unfortunately not any food from the kitchen.

I walked out of there and grabbed a sandwich on my way back to work because I wasnt going to wait any longer.

I will never go there again and I can tell you that most of the people who were sitting on the patio around me are in the same boat!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  It is more casual and less expensive than most of he other options, and the food was great.  Perfect option for when you want easy but good Japanese food."}
{"text":"Everytime I head out to an all-you-can-eat sushi place, I make a little wish that they get the rice correctly done.

It is apparently a huge challenge for almost every AYCE here in Montreal.

The fried tempura rolls are a bit better as it improves the taste, it's best to skip most maki.

Now onto the good stuff, lots of good stuff here. The night was pretty good but the sashimi was awesome, fresh tasting and huge. 

Their menu is very eclectic and includes juice or soft drinks. We barely got a chance to try the second page of their menu. The selection of Asian dishes like General Tao or Pad Thai looked good as well.

The interior is nice but the terrace really stands out, so enjoying a warm late September evening is a must here."}
{"text":"The service was really bad, they barely looked at us while we were sitting at the table. The menu is misleading. While we thought we were going to receive a plate full of shrimps as seen in the menu's picture, we received a very small plate with a piece of meat and one shrimp. We didn't even have time to eat all the things we wanted to have because we were receiving each plate after 15 minutes. The sushis were just okay. I'd rather go to another place where they serve you well instead of going there again. I'm not going to repeat it and I highly not recommend you to go there!"}
{"text":"The all the you can eat is set up and priced fairly well. It is easy to just write your items on the paper and hand it in. All the portions are small, which helps because you can try a bunch of things and if you want more... just order multiples.

Try the sushi pizza, and other non sushi menu items  they were good and added some variety."}
{"text":"Food quality is high and taste is excellent.  Sushimi is fresh and food presentation is great.  However food serving speed is too slow and kills my appetite."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi menu is delicious and filled with plenty of options. Also, I ate the Bento box and the portion size is worth it. Overall, I give this place a four because the service lacks a bit, as they get pretty  busy during lunch. My advice to the waiters, always ask customers if they need anything else, fill water glasses, and don't forget to keep an eye on your tables if their done eating."}
{"text":"Kuu Bistro is definitely one of my top 3 All-You-Can-Eat sushi place. The ambiance is great, the waiters are nice and the food is amazing. Either for lunch or for dinner, you'll be pleased with the variety of choices. There's a lot to choose from! Their sushis are not only well presented, they're also delicious! You'll come back wanting more. If you're not into the all-you-can-eat concept, they also have a multitude of choices of bentos boxes that cost around 15$, depending on what you want."}
{"text":"Nice place inside , upstairs very beautiful has a nice view. All you can eat. Sushis are good"}
{"text":"Very good place for all you can eat Japanese food ! It's pretty cheap for the buffet, the food is very good and there is a huge quantity of choices. The waiters are nice and the place really fancy!"}
{"text":"La nourriture était très très mauvaise. Le poulet Kaarage n'avait pas l'air sanitaire du tout, le sashimi rice était \"mouillé\" et le kimchi tofu avait un gout farineux et trop épicé. 
Nous sommes partis en plein milieu du souper, ce que je n'ai JAMAIS fais de ma vie. 

Le service en revanche était agréable et ils nous ont accommodé quand nous avons décidé de partir."}
{"text":"A great dinner! Service was excellent. Ambiance is cozy and fun. Food was very good. I am not a sushi expert but it all tasted plenty fresh to me (bento menu) and it was very nicely presented. Tempura very light and crispy. Soups were rich and tasty. The family loved it all."}
{"text":"Dans la catégorie des \"à volonté\" il est dans mes tops clairement !
Déjà, la carte est immense, avec des choses assez originales (en tout cas pour un à volonté), les boissons sont incluses, et il y a une grande terrasse qui donne sur la rue (qui m'a paru bien moins passante que ce dont je me souvenais).
On retiendra : le calamar entier grillé, les sushis flambés, les grosses pièces de sashimis, et des serveuses hyper sympathiques (ce qui est quand même plutôt peu commun dans un à volonté). 
Un bon endroit pour faire une halte entre 2 magasins !! :)"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food, esp the rolls and ramen. They offer so many creative items in their menu. We will definitely go back! Patio seating is also great."}
{"text":"To be honestly, this is the best Japanese restaurant in Montreal with budget price. (Lunch all you can eat) 
The fried shrimps are perfect and others sushi also nice. 
I am Korean and the taste is really fit on me. 
(Really feels like asian food and taste) 
Not salty, not so sweet.
I don't really understand why this restaurant has low reputation. 
Anyways I will definitely come here again !! 
Thank you"}
{"text":"We arrived before opening hours for ramen and they were kind enough to serve us. First thing I noticed, the place was really clean. The ramen was delicious and   the soup base was flavorful and not too salty. Portion size was reasonable, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"La bouffe était vraiment bonne pour le prix. J'ai pris une Bento Box - spécial du midi. Le décor est très beau, mais je donne qu'un 3 étoiles car le service était vraiment ordinaire. J'ai posé une question sur le menu et le serveur a quasiment fait un soupir + nos soupes Miso ne sont pas toutes arrivés en même temps, et tiède pour la moitié. Ils servent des verres d'eau dans des verres en plastiques jetables ??? Ça devrait être interdit. J'y retournerai peut-être pour une Bento Box bien rapide, sans trop d'attente pour le service - comme si j'était dans un fast food."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat lunch, with a 2 for $20 coupon. Judging it was ~$10 per person, I was rather skeptical.

But it didn't disappoint! Food quality was great, definitely recommend getting the hot items like teriyaki and grilled. Takoyaki was awesome and their tempura was well executed as well. Fish tastes fresh, and the atmosphere was chic.

They don't serve plain sashimi at lunch...which means you'll have to get sushi aka a ball of rice if you want to eat sashimi. Also, they missed quite a few items despite ordering them a second time. Ended up telling the servers so they could bring the items we were missing. 
Otherwise, if you have a coupon, definitely give it a try! Even if you don't, lunch is reasonably priced at $15, not sure about dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch.  The service was friendly both times. It was also crowded both times from about 11:30-1pm.  First time I got a chicken teriyaki bento box.  It was both delicious and affordable.

The second time I got the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet.  What a HUGE menu!  The taro, pumpkin, and shrimp tempura were all excellent.  The unagi, salmon skin, raw salmon, and fish roe were all very good sushi.  The other sushi I had was pretty good as well.  With such a big menu you're sure to find something you like.  Other suggestions: seaweed salad, garlic mushrooms, green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"The service was great,they're extremely nice to us! It's a cozy place to have dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Decor is simple, friendly staff but too bad the food wasn't too great, raw fish wasn't fresh which made me had a really bad vertigo and got me very sick the next day. This is my first time experiencing food poisoning at a Japanese bistro. Not sure if Im planning on coming back."}
{"text":"The worst services I ever experience in a resturant. Wrong order, delay of foods, and the servers doesn't make senses. You never expect when a waiter bring out the birthday cake, that he took it with the box and the plastic bag still wrap, no knife, no plates and utensils, imagine if we want to surprise the birthday guy, that was really surprise all of us. In addition, he gave us a sashimi knife to cut cake. We also ordered different kind of ice-cream, he put all the ice-cream in one plate and expected us(11 persons)share in one single plate plus 3 spoons given only! And the tips are mandatory added to the bills, I don't think this kind of services deserve 15% of tips! Will never go back again and highly not recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the half-price specials on Mother's day. Sushi rolls were ordinary, and do not look like the pictures on the menu. Sushis are surprisingly small. Teriyaki shrimp and mussels are not bad. Dessert ice creams are very good!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi but you don't always get what you asked for. We never got our salmon sashimi but got some sushi we hadn't ordered. The service is a bit awkward but effective and fast in the end and that's all that matters I guess! Would recommend to friends and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It wasn't that busy on a Friday late afternoon and I went and grabbed a pitcher to pour my own water because no one was coming around. Also they have this new playlist of all covers of pop songs and they're the worst songs I've ever heard. Food is OK. I come here because it's convenient."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I've been frequenting this restaurant even since it opened. The quality has remained consistent and the prices are very reasonable. The service is really great too. I highly recommend this place. Thanks Kuu! :)"}
{"text":"The best sushi all you can eat buffet. I even log-in to Yelp app to write this review. It was way better than Fisshu which is placed right across the street. Fresh, Fast, and the warmest server ever! I noticed few bad comment about this restaurant, bur for me, it was a great experience.( Maybe they changed since then? Thx yelp reviewers!)

I went to the restaurant right after 3pm when the all you can eat thing starts. The price was $25 which is a quite reasonable cost for the food.  

There are over 200 menus which seems quite a lot to handle. But actually, the quality wasnt bad at all. Most of them are quite good. OMG, I loved their thick cutted salmon and clab sasimi the most. Beside their chassu-don and shirmp tempura was dope as well. 
It is a mistery why fisshu(tooooooo much rice and sasimi quality is awful) is way more popular than here."}
{"text":"I had a $20 for 2 lunch coupon for this all you can eat sushi restaurant and decided to give it a try.

It is downtown and located near The Bay. On the day that I went for lunch (roughly at 1:15pm), it wasn't crowded and we were seated right away.

It is like most AYCE sushi places which a few exceptions that I noticed immediately. The first thing is that they also have take out and included in the all you can eat price, is free soft drink (poured from a 2L bottle so it was somewhat flat).

The normal price for lunch during my visit was $16+tax+tip per person so $20+tax+tip for 2 people is a very good deal considering also that going anywhere for lunch can cost ~$10+tax and it wouldn't be all you can eat.

The all you can eat menu has a lot of items with some items not found in most all you can eat sushi places (like French fries, spring rolls, ramen, etc.). The one thing that I immediately noticed missing (we went there during lunch so I'm not sure if the same is true for dinner where the prices are higher) is that there is no sashimi during lunch.

Service was not the best. The restaurant didn't seem that busy yet there were times when we had to ask for a refill of our water. Also, we had picked 10 tempura shrimp and were brought out 5 tempura shrimp. Since it is an all you can eat place, we just re-ordered 10 more tempura shrimp and for some reason they brought out 5 tempura shrimp again. That being said, I found that they brought the food out at a decent pace.

Since we only had a limited amount of time for lunch (it was a work day), we unfortunately left without trying any of their desserts.

At the special $20 for 2 coupon for lunch, I will probably be back before my coupons expire. Hopefully service improves in my next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. C'est à volonté jusqu'à 15h mais ils te refusent le lunch et t'imposent dinner à partir de 14h30. Et quand tu arrivent à 14h24 et bien c'est pareil. Quand tu tiens bon ils te mettent des conditions comme passer une seule commande. Ce sont les serveurs qui font la loi et c'est au mood de chacun. Je trouve ça d'une rigidité exagérée. Surtout qu'ils ne ferment pas la cuisine et ne font pas de pauses. Ils continuent de servir la même chose mais il faut juste que tu paies plus. Je dis bien 14h24. Le serveur est venu me prendre la commande en me disant je prends plus d'autres c'est la dernière."}
{"text":"Kuu is cooool.  Great tapas style Japanese food.  The service is good, but it is not great.  They are still going through the growing pains of a new restaurant, Although my waitress was really friendly and witty.  The place has a really nice decor.  I love the \"hardwood floor on the wall\" look.  The quality of food is really good.  Unique items on the menu, however I wish the portions were a little bigger.  The prices are reasonable but you need a lot of dishes to be full, so the bill adds up quickly.  I am really happy this place is close to where I live because I love it and I will be back, OFTEN!"}
{"text":"Sushi has too much rice in them so they make you full very fast. 

We ordered a few rolls and they were ok but definitely not great.

Also ordered 2 different ramen and both were below average.

Decor was decent but flavors were lacking. Will not be back unless nothing else to eat around there."}
{"text":"Terrible at taking orders right. They kept forgetting to bring out the ones I ordered and told me it wasn't on the ordering paper, when I knew for sure it was the first thing I wrote on the ordering paper. Smh.. And they also brought me things I didn't even order. I ate them anyway. Plus servers were not friendly at all, no hello, bye or thank you. Food was okay, not anything special. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"It's a shame . The sushi we ordered were just  outstanding. But the service is much more bellow zero. The guy I asked for the help is very rude. No apologies for not providing ginger and wasabi on time and no one were coming back to us to ask if we need any assistance anymore. I even went inside to pay my bill. One big disappointment."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I'm a big fan of all you can eat anything.  When it comes to all you can eat sushi, I tend to stay away from the rolls and prefer to gorge on sashimi and cooked items like salmon teriyaki.  At Kuu, I went for it and tried a little bit of everything and I can say that it was all pretty amazing.  They had some inventive rolls, some torched sushi and good variety of shashimi.  They also had a really cool sushi pizza that came on fried eggplant instead of a rice cake. 

The only complaint I have was that it was a very hot evening and they didn't seem to have their air conditioning on, or working very well.  Having said that, the service was excellent, fast and friendly and the water refills were plentiful. 

They also have a lovely terrace, so if you're in the area and looking for a new all you can eat sushi experience, I suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Craving Asian while touring the city, we accidentally walked into this place. We were about to walkout as we thought it was only all you can eat per the menu and signage. The waiter informed us that they have ala carte. We ordered the beef ramen, spring rolls, fried dumplings, Philadelphia roll, avocado and celery roll, and miso soup since we wanted to try a little bit of everything. Let me start with the philly roll as it had real crab (not imitation like a lot of other places) and it was very delicious. The avocado and celery roll was nothing special. The miso was extremely good with chunks of seaweed, spices, and tofu. This was my daughter's favorite. The spring rolls were good but oddly served with ketchup. The fried pork dumplings were good. The beef ramen had a white miso based with lots of goodies, good portion of beef, and noodles were tasty. If craving a quick bite of Asian, this place has nice service and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 people. Went for a work lunch. It took them 45 minutes to bring the first round of order to our table. 2 hours later, we were still waiting for the remaining items of our order. We asked to see the manager as we couldn't wait any longer and asked for discount as we didn't get our full order. The manager was not accommodating at all and gave us no discount. Neither the food nor the service were good. Won't recommend this place to anyone. Also, make sure you have at least 3 hours to spare if you're going here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Went there at the end of the night. It was half hour to close. The staff sat us, but then made us feel like they just wanted us out. We chose the all you can eat menu. Many of the items we ordered didn't get served. The food that did come was mediocre. We're from Vancouver so we are really spoiled when it comes to sushi. Think this restaurant benefits from the nearby hotel and tourists in the neighbourhood. Recommend you avoid it."}
{"text":"The food is good, but nothing impressive. The sashimi's freshness is like any ayce restaurant; passable but not amazing. They're open for ayce at lunch by they also have a bento menu which is decent. Ramen is good and the char siu portions are huge. The one item I really enjoyed was the flame torched salmon sushi, I really recommend it! Otherwise you could find better sashimi elsewhere if that's what you're searching for."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian bento box, it was really good! The place can get busy, but for a quick lunch we managed to get a table for a group of us."}
{"text":"I decided to try a sushi restaurant close to my hotel. The food is good. Some of the rolls are a little heavy on the rice to fill you up. The service is less than desirable. I ordered my appetizer, which came after the main course. You have to continually ask for wasibi and ginger. You have to fill out your order with paper and pen and place on the table until they pick it up. And, you had to remind them to pick it up otherwise it would sit there for a while. Overall the service was poor."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont très bons, tout comme les autres plats offret, comme le pad thaï, le riz, le poulet général tao et autres. Les patates douces pané sont un délice. De plus certains brevages sont inclus dans le menu à volonté. Bien situé à Montréal. Le seul hic, qui est quand même vraiment plate, est  que le personnel est bête, le sourire à l'air d'être en option."}
{"text":"This place was referred by my boyfriend. :) i always have their veg box for lunch for 11$ . Worth the money! :)"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian food (had the noodle dishes), great atmosphere, they stay open later than most places AND it's BYOB! Can't get better than that."}
{"text":"went for lunch there a few times and didn't like it

a la carte menu and set lunches for about 20 bux with tax and tip.

quality of the food is like an all you can eat resto. 

Would not recommend unless
For the typical people that don't know what good asian food is and who works in the business district."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian and being invited to meet your friends at a Japanese restaurant is always tricky. But we may never miss the opportunity to have great moments with great people! 

Many different people told me this was the best all you can eat Japanese in town... so... why not. 

They actually have a lot of vegetarian options in their menu which is awesome. The pieces are a bit small... but I kinda liked it so you can taste different sorts of sushis. 

If you're not keen on having the whole all you can eat stuff... they actually have one vegetarian option in their meal options. And the meal is huge. 

Based on the (vegetarian) sushis that I had and also based on my (non-vegetarian) friends' comments... they have very good sushis for the price. Don't expect much from the service, tho. It is definitely something that they could have some improve."}
{"text":"Our experience here was horrible; however, the food was very good. The Coke we had to drink was past its expiration date, and tasted old. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant so she could not keep up with the orders. The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other."}
{"text":"It is true that terrible service can ruin what was actually a good meal. I almost rated this place a 1, but that would be a lie. The sushi, udon, spring rolls and dumplings were all quite good. The ambiance is nice and I enjoyed the view from upstairs. The service is probably the worst I have had anywhere in years - from bringing the wrong food, to taking 15 minutes to get drinks, empty water and then literally having to walk the check to the register because it was another 15 minutes. We ended up taking our udon to go because it took so long to arrive. I'm not sure where the breakdown is in their management, but it is serious. I watched people sit down and leave from the same table twice in the time I was in there.  I almost wish I spoke French better so I could complain. Sorry guys, I would pass on this place. It will just make you angry."}
{"text":"We had the sushi sashimi bento box and the spicy chasu ramen. Very romantic atmosphere, good for having a conversation. The ramen was one of the best I've ever had, it definitely beats some of the other ramen places in Montreal! I find most ramen places to have extremely salty food, which wasn't the case here. The bento box was average, but what impressed me was the veggie tempura - it has four different kinds of vegetables, not just yam! The only downside to their food was that the rice for the sushi was under seasoned and ginger or wasabi didn't come with the meal. TL;DR: try it out!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from Washington, DC and I LOVED this place. 

in one week i went twice and got food from the all you can eat menu. 

Their food is delicious and i like that all orders are in the smaller side so you can make a sampling out of your meal. I do not eat seafood so I stuck with veggie sushi, veggie tempura (which i love that you could mix and match how many pieces of each vegetable you wanted), teriyaki chicken, garlic beef and others. EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD. ALL YOU CAN EAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, THEY KEEP IT COMING."}
{"text":"Got these 2/$20 AYCE sushi coupons in the mail, and went twice in two weeks!

I highly recommend the teriyaki salmon, takoyaki (octopus balls), Saury fish, flaming dragon, and spicy salmon. My (Caucasian) friends really liked the Mango Tango too!"}
{"text":"Le sushi est bon mais le service pas terrible. D'abord, il n'y a pas de sashimi au menu du midi. Nous n'avons pas eu de gingembre et wasabi non plus. Le serveur n'était pas très utile et devait aller consulter tout le temps ses collègues. Enfin, il nous ont pas demandé si on voulait une ou deux factures.
Il y a d'autres restaurants de sushi à volonté dans le coin, je ne choisirai pas celui-ci la prochaine fois."}
