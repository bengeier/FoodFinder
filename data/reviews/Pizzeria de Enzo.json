{"text":"Food ok...customer service crappy. very pushy even when no one is in line. will not be going back."}
{"text":"Little pizza place in the Venetian between the entrance to the elevators to the hotel rooms and the walkway to the main check-in desk. I ended up getting a quick bite to eat here because it was very convenient. It's still Vegas prices  but at least it was never too crowded. Also, free wi-fi here.  I had to do some work on my trip (yeah - even in Vegas) and  there is one table here that actually has an electrical outlet  right next to it so you can hang out for a while and plug in  a laptop if need be. The wi-fi connection here was actually  pretty good and I could connect to my employer's VPN without  much of a problem. I would even say it was better than the  connection in my room which they actually charge for.     So I got breakfast here - eggs, sausage, french toast for  a reasonable price. Also lunch - usually several Sicilian pizza slices and a drink. Decent pizzas - not the best I ever had but definitely hit the spot. You can charge it to your room (if you're staying at the Venetian) so that's a plus. Also, if you face the  casino while sitting at the tables it's great for people-watching."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick lunch and headed over to one of my favorite, Noodle Asia, but I knew I wasn't eating there since the line was a mile long.  So , I sighed and headed over to the food court on the same level as the Venetian Casino.  I don't expect much from a counter service place, but I noted while standing in line and evaluating the foods displayed in the glass counter, I thought, this is going to be better than a typical walk up counter place.  While not the greatest place to have Italian, especially in Vegas and especially inside the Venetian, the meal was better than adequate.  If you're looking for a quick fix, then this place will meet your expectations."}
{"text":"After being too impatient to wait for Noodle Asia to open, I went to the worst food court ever.  Pizzeria de Enzo was the only place in the Venetian Vicinity to grab food for a quick bite.  I got an open face spinach and onion crostini for $6 just to get something to eat.  It was mediocre, but I did not have high expectations.  They get credit for being convenient, especially because its open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"The stuffed pizza by the slice was NASTY. The thing was so greasy it was inedible. There was zero flavor. Glad it was just a slice! The garlic knots were dry and hard and flavorless."}
{"text":"Horribly rude Italian Granma running the counter.  She wanted to give me a lesson on proper Italian pronunciations.  If I gave a rats ass how to speak Italian, I would take a class!  A simple order that would normally take 2 minutes took 10.  I almost left at that point and wish that I would have.  The mystery meat lasagna was mushy and the flavor off.  I was dumb enough to eat it though as I was very hungry and in the middle of a poker tournament. Definitely regretted it the next day as I was quite ill.  I will never eat there again, and I visit the Venetian regularly.  I can't believe the Venetian allows this place to do business in such a great casino."}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza in the Venetian.  It's located just around the corner from the main lobby.  Pizza slices are New York style - thin crust, but huge slice.  Single topping is about $5 per slice.  At first, it seems like a let down because you think you are going to get a slice of pizza that has been sitting under the heat lamp all day.  But once you order, they pull a piece out and heat it up in the pizza oven for a few minutes.  Good service and good quality, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Very good and greasy pizza.  The last touch of throwing it in the oven and serving it piping hot made it great.  Great pizza that is available 24-7, hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The people at the pizza told me I had to pay and I said I paid with the girl up front and they continued to argue with me and told me I can't have pepperoni and sausage that I paid for cause I didn't pay yet and I told them I paid more than once and looked st the girl and she said I paid and they still argued, so I just took a pepperoni and left. But! Terrrrribl fucking service and rude rude rude ass servers, cause I paid, yet, I am wrong about paying even though the girl that took my pepperoni and sausage order said I paid for it, but they don't have ir"}
{"text":"Egg shells in our pancakes, the crepes were so dry!!  The woman who was cleaning the glass case where the food is kept/cooked was coughing all over everything she was cleaning and the food!! What a waste!"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from food that I'm getting from a food court. But even with my lowered expectations, I was still disappointed.   I ordered spaghetti. I LOVE spaghetti. Even cheap food court spaghetti. But the spaghetti here was not satisfying at all. The sauce was practically flavorless and was too diluted - not the slightest bit chunky at all. I ended up only eating half of it and tossing the rest. And I only ate that much of it because I was STARVING and needed something in my stomach before heading out for the night.  One plus - you get a side with your order. I opted for the Caesar salad, which was decent. You can't really mess that up too bad can you?  Vegas prices, so expect to shell out a few more bucks for something you would normally get for cheaper elsewhere.  Maybe I should have just been safe and gone with the pizza."}
{"text":"Be really drunk and order a whole pie. It'll be good times. Don't go there if you are sober!!"}
{"text":"If you're in The Venetian and you need a quick bite, the pizza here just may be right up your alley. It's located right off the main casino floor, near the front registration desk. It's nestled in a small food court.  Th slices are pricey, will likely run you $5+ (more money if you add toppings or get specialty slices). The day I was there I had 2 slices: mushroom and pepperoni and a two cheese/basil combo. Both were thin and were heated up in their oven. Overall I enjoyed them, but for $12.97 - man, they better have tasted good!  Comparable to Secret Pizza @ Cosmo, but definitely lacking. The tastes are about the same, with Secret PIzza winning by a hair. However, Secret Pizza's prices are obviously much more friendly than this little pizzeria.   And for those not interested in pizza, they do serve other Italian dishes, which appeared to me to look dissatisfying to say the least."}
{"text":"I stopped here because I had no choice and I was quiet pleased. I ordered a large pizza and it was about 30$s the pizza was big and greasy just like any other pizza only difference is that it is located in the Venetian."}
{"text":"Staying at the Palazzo, this was tooooooo conveniently located not to go after a night at the clubs. Especially when Asian Noodle closes at 3am and Pizzeria de Enzo is open 24 hours.  Garlic knots and pizza by the slice at 3am? Tooooooo clutch. TOO CLUTCH. Knots were great and crust of the pizza was delicious.  Came back when I was sober on another Vegas trip and the knots were just as good, crust of the pizza though was eh.  After going their drunk and sober *drum roll*: Drunk, 5 stars for. Sober, 3. #Shocker"}
{"text":"Pizzeria de Enzo is a small little pizzeria on the casino level floor of The Venetian in Las Vegas.  Their slices are like a true New York style of pizza-- large, thin crusts with a variety of toppings.  It's a great place for a quick tasty bite."}
