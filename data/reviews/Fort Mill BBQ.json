{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Sat outside and enjoyed the BBQ pork platter with baked beans, coleslaw, and hush puppies on the side.  My husband got a burger and onion rings.  Food was tasty though portions weren't as generous as at similar BBQ places in the area.  It was enough for me (an average female) though some men or big eaters might wish there was more.  Our server was friendly but the food took quite a while to come out, considering that we were the only customers.  Not sure why the kitchen was so slow. Still, the food was a pretty good value so we will likely return"}
{"text":"Overall a decent place, clean curtious staff.  Had the brisket, was well seasoned but a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after living in South Carolina for 6 years because they advertise gluten free. The cashiers were very friendly and helpful about ordering my food but the cook seemed irritated when they asked him a question and they Only had one fryer working so could not get wings that would be gluten free. I ordered the sampler and the food was so so. Unfortunately I has a severe reaction after eating here. The kitchen obviously did not take precautions. They advertise gluten free but really should not."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is starting to take short cuts.  The Mac and cheese which I usually love from here was not as good the last couple of times.  The chicken didn't even taste like it was smoked.  Green beans were bland...maybe from a can.  The smoked sausage with pimento was still good, but anything is good drowned in cheese.  I am kind of afraid to go back because the last two times were so disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered food online for pick-up. Seems like a handy way to get food. While I was waiting customer came in and informed staff that his okra was missing. Should of been a warning. Picked my food up and drove home. As I unpacked my food noticed I was short. Ordered turkey breast with 2 sides, neither side was in bag. Also ordered the sausage with 2 sides and only 1 was included. Please do not waste your time and money at this marginal establishment.   BTW mac and cheese may be most greasy unpleasant abomination I have ever had the displeasure of gagging on. Maybe not having sides was a blessing in disguise.   Disappointed that Yelp does not give me option of zero stars."}
{"text":"I had the brisket the servings are small and the meat had no smoke ring I think it was cooked in an oven! My wife had the turkey breast that was good moist and a mild smoke flavor."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch.  It was the first time I've been there since reopening.  The Cuban Sandwich was amazing.   I give 5 stars all around; service, food, atmosphere, music was all great."}
{"text":"I had a large pork plate with spare rib mac cheese and hush puppies. Every thing was good. I'm just not convinced that it was worth the $$$$.  I've had better BBQ but it was $15."}
{"text":"ONLY of u want over priced food , poor service and dry food. And the manager/owner argues with the customers when they have problems with their food."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bottom line: this is damn good barbecue. Though they have a variety of meats I'm going to talk about the basics of pulled pork, ribs and chicken. All slow smoked, tender and gently spiced. Speaking off, one of the best things I can say is that Fort Mill BBQ tinkered with the recipe since opening a few years ago, dialing back a bit on the rub. They found the perfect ratio and although their variety of sauces can be a nice compliment, I prefer their cue straight up. Another main course favorite of mine is the brisket Philly with peppers. Lots of savory notes that go well with the selection of craft beers on tap. The sides are addictive, especially the mac&cheese and corn fritters. Another Southern treat is the collards - hey it's a semi healthy option too :) The service is fast and friendly and now they have an app for ordering delivery and pickup. And speaking of, recently when I had trouble with the app, Fort Mill BBQ made it right by me, including having my order delivered by a beautiful girl who looks like Taylor Swift if Ms. Swift upgraded to redhead (turns out she's the manager).  Seriously, Fort Mill BBQ Co. Is a local treasure."}
{"text":"Moved to Fort Mill in the summer of 2015. Visited the Fort Mill BBQ in the fall of 2015 and was unimpressed with the decor, service, food, etc. (e.g., you ordered food at a counter and the food was brought out later (plastic utensils); the brisket was very fatty and no wine, to name a few shortcomings). Recently heard from a family member that they had significantly upgraded the restaurant and so went back to check it out. Like night and day -- new (appropriate for bbq) decor, bar with good seating, sit down food service (our waitress was great) and solid bbq menu. Food (e.g., the spare ribs, brisket and sides) was very good, nice selection of sauces, cheap (but decent) wine. On top of all that the manager/owner? (David, I think his name was) came out to talk to us and it was clear that he was interested in getting things right. If you haven't been in there in awhile, I definitely think they've earned another shot."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not 5 star is that twice they forgot to send bbq sauce home in my take out. That was really lame cause I love the signature sauce. But the food is a full on 5 star, amazing, deep, smokey flavor in the meat and the smokey corn is to die for."}
{"text":"I ship their sauce to all my relatives all over the country. I love it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. I've been to a number of BBQ restaurants in Charlotte, and this restaurant's food was not that great. I ordered the Brisket. The texture of a well done brisket is that it sort of juicy and breaks apart easy. It isn't supposed to be dry and tough. Brisket here was a tough chew. I didn't have their BBQ, but my friend said it was ok. Price was pretty expensive. I got two pieces of Brisket, two sides, and it cost 12.99 if I remember correctly. I thought it was just a tad expensive for this type of restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly though. I really liked them. The food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"This place is a very great bbq place and a good place for wings.. I Def recommended over 521 bbq. We've  always received great service and food. They've recently renovated the whole menu so alot of menu has changed. We love this place."}
{"text":"Best bbq joint in town. Dale is the pit master and he smokes some very amazing food. Friendly staff and atmosphere. It's even friendly for kids to eat here"}
{"text":"Really good food. Ate there after running 13 miles for a spartan race,  and had awesome food and sides. The mac and cheese was definitely to die for. That and the beef brisket were so good. The staff were very friendly,  and the food came out very fast. Good place for quick eats."}
{"text":"GREAT mac and cheese.  Really great mac and cheese as a matter of fact.  It is baked, not a prepared sauce poured over pasta which is typical of most places.  So, so good.    Bbq sauces were tasty.  Fries were so-so.    Decor is nothing special, but who expects that from a bbq joint."}
{"text":"Not impressed with our Togo order. Looked like it was slapped together. The cheese fries looked like they had no cheese on them. Also we did not receive a receipt after paying."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Food delicious, regardless of what you order but corn fritters are the BEST with honey butter, DIVINE. Staff is always willing to assist and obigble. Anna, Rebecca, Lynn, and Sarah are wonderful.   They have daily food and beer specials. Thursday ladies night - half off draft beers! They always have a great selection of local brews which is always a plus in my book.    TVs for your sport viewing pleasure.  Ample parking as the location is part of a shopping/strip plaza. Hidden treasure,  come check it out"}
{"text":"Excellent place for reasonably priced BBQ! Hubby and I stopped here today for lunch.  They have amazing lunch specials.  I got the pulled chicken sandwich with mac n cheesefor $9 I believe. My husband got the burnt end sandwich which was brisket. He practically ate the samdehich whole.  During lunch they have FREE sweet and unsweetened tea. So total our meal was only $21. Our server Chantelle was awesome at giving us the rundown on all the bbq and what the favorites are. She also explained the range of sauces which were amazing as well.   We sat outside where they have picnic tables with umbrellas. Very relaxing.  We will definitely be back. They do to go orders as well."}
{"text":"The proprietor needs to go back to BBQ school. I tried ribs, brisket and pulled pork. It was all dry, cold and tasteless. I suspect the meat is cooked elsewhere and shipped in. It ranks with the most disappointing BBQ I ever had. I seriously doubt they have won awards for their Q. I felt I should have asked for a refund and an apology for wasting my time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Great food. My husband and I had them cater our wedding 2 yrs ago and have come back to eat for our anniversary both yrs. Service has been great both times!"}
{"text":"SMALL PORTIONS. The only thing keeping this from getting a 4 or 5 star review is the size of the portions. I ordered a regular BBQ sandwich with Mac and Cheese. For 9$ I'd expect to be full. If I were a big boy I'd get the large. But I fell that a large would of filled me up. A regular size BBQ sandwich did not fill me up. Small portion of Mac and cheese too :/ sorry guys, I'm gonna stick with 521 BBQ."}
{"text":"So this review is for food only.  My house mom (long story) brought me back some take-out from here, and from my first bite of rib, I wanted to cry from sheer joy.  These were the most incredible dry-rub ribs ever!  The rub was moderately spicy, and had a nice burn, the meat was tender, almost falling off the bone, just the way I like it.  Cole slaw was good.  I'm dairy and gluten free and bbq is definitely one of those things that is easy to do GF/CF.  Can't wait to go there in person!"}
{"text":"I'm reticent to give 5 stars on my first visit, but I have to say I missed it the first time.  2nd day in a row that we've come here and we have been delisciously rewarded with another fabulous meal experience. I say \"experiencec because everything about both our visits here was fabulous!  They make you feel at home and valued, so the service is topnotch. We both had burgers this time with a starter of the delish hush puppies. Charlene had the Carolina Burger and I had the FMBBQ Grilled Burger. The fresh vegetables on our burgers, the Chipotle cheese, the chili on Charlene's, and the bun, yes, the BUN, every bite was wonderful! We also tried different sides this time - Charlene, the fried green beans, and I true the garlic mashed red potatoes with gravy. Both were great and come to find out they take a while day to make the potatoes. Of you're a beer drinker they also have s great selection of some NC and SC beers, I loved Legal Remedy's Jalepeno Pineapple beer from Rock Hill, and Charlene had a Grapefruit Shandy from Spartanburg. Bottom line - I'm sure over the next visits as I work my way through their menu I will not be disappointed. Fort Mill BBQ has become our new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Service was quick, friendly and attentive, food was excellent! Some of the best BBQ and sides I've had in awhile! Portions were pretty big too. I couldve stopped halfway through but I ate the whole plate! They have 2 sauces, their signature (tomato based) and mustard/vinegar. I tried both and they're equally good, I switched back and forth or even mixed the two sauces! Luckily I work in Fort Mill otherwise it is a little far to get to from Charlotte. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"2nd meal at FTBBQ Food is always good, but service remains lame.  Servers trying to figure out who is serving, slow drink, slow menu, no silverware and idiotic banter - bring your patience and earplugs"}
{"text":"I wish that I was able to give zeros but clearly that isn't possible. I have been eating BBQ all around the area as well as the United States for 20 plus years and this joint is by far the worst that I have ever tasted. I was referred here by a friend but I will never take advice about BBQ from him again. I noticed that the restaurant was on the SC BBQ trail and won awards but the BBQ trail must send you to the worst BBQ joints and I am not sure what type of judges would like this BBQ. The staff was pretty friendly except the counter lady and the cook were arguing about how hot/cold the temperature in the kitchen and dining room should be. I had a BBQ Plate that was sized for a 10 year old kid and it was TERRIBLE. if you are looking for good BBQ, I would suggest to stay FAR FAR AWAY from this joint. The BBQ was burnt, Cole Slaw (pretty sure they bought it from Harris Teeter) and Fries (you can't screw those up). I would recommend other BBQ restaurants but the owner would probably think that I worked from them.   Bubba"}
{"text":"BBQ was ok, but don't bother leaving a tip at the register.  it won't get you silverware (with salads or soup).  also make sure they don't charge you for a $2 fountain drink when all u wanted was a cup for water.  also, don't believe the girl at the register when she says she's not authorized to provide a refund on that $2 for the beverage u didn't want/ask for - she just needs to get a code to credit your credit card back.  she tried to offer me a $5 off my next order card but I knew I probably wouldn't be coming back so I opted for the $2.  oh, and the Mac and cheese/tomato soup looks and tastes pretty disgusting, I wouldn't recommend it and even the one adult in the restaurant who cleared our plastic baskets did not seem surprised that we didn't like the soup/mac & cheese dish.  again, BBQ being decent was the only reason for any stars.  disappointing overall dining experience for family visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"The barbeque that they serve must not be what they have won competitions with. Its just ok bbq with ok sides. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We travel miles for good BBQ and this is the best we've found in 100 miles. The pork and brisket are always melt-in-your-mouth and the people there are the friendliest of any restaurant we've been to. All the sides we've tried have been great and the corn fritters with the honey butter are almost like a dessert. Be sure to check out the website for the car shows too."}
{"text":"I got two carry out orders of pull pork baskets. One with fries and one with onion rings. Food was good but The fries/onion rings portion was extremely small for 8.00 each. I had like five little onion rings and my other order had like 10 small fries...."}
{"text":"$40 worth of gross. The only thing we enjoyed were the hush puppies. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and Mac N Cheese. The Texas toast was melted butter on white bread which did not appear to have been toasted.   This place has the quality to AMP up the decor. Their BBQ blows Jim and Nicks away, but the decor is like a cheap dive. The owners should look at Midwood for some interior design options. This is more of a take out for dinner than a dine in."}
{"text":"Good food, good value for the money.  The owner also hosts a cruise in during the summer months, tons of really nice cars and trucks.   They will deliver.  Always consistently the same quality, really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down with the kids or run in for lunch for a quick bite,. I love the 3 bones with the sweet sauce and my new favorite things is there corn fritters.  I also really like all the made from scratch soups and how no matter what, come rain or shine you can find the owner Bob in his office watching over his baby."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at Fort Mill BBQ Company on our way back from Sheep Shearing Day at Historic Brattonsville.  It really is a challenge to cook BBQ in a restaurant setting -- trying to work out timings in having meats be ready and trying not to hold them too long in warmers is really tricky!  To get a proper feel of a BBQ place takes at least 2 or 3 visits.  However, I can only base my reviews on one visit...  At Fort Mill BBQ Company, you order at the counter, and the food is brought out to you.  We ordered a sampler plate (with an extra rib) and a pork BBQ plate with mac & cheese and baked beans.  I'll summarize my thoughts by each piece.  First, the good...  The pork was very flavorful and not too dry.  The brisket had a nice looking smoke ring and was tasty, but I wish it had not been drenched in their house BBQ sauce (along with the turkey and sausage).  The sausage was pretty tasty -- not too spicy.  The turkey was by far the best part of the meal.  It was very moist and flavorful with just the right amount of smoke.  The mac & cheese was good and cheesy.  And then the not-so-good...  The wings (which I ordered smoked and tossed in a chipotle sauce) were oversmoked and had a chemical taste.  I could not taste the sauce very well, but it did not have any sort of chipotle flavor at all.  The baked beans tasted like they were straight out of a can.  So my final thoughts?  Decent.  Is it worth driving an hour from Mint Hill to visit on a repeated basis?  Not really..."}
{"text":"My wife  stopped in awhile back to pick up dinner on a whim. Unfortunatley she waited quite awhile for the food and when she got it home plated it up and we began to eat there was just nothing special about it. Kinda bland overly smokey and the sauce wasn't there she had the beef and I had the pork sandwich with chicken strips for the tot. When I checked my bill I almost fell out of my chair 30 some odd dollars for small portions and drinks not impressed to say the least. We have not been back maybe I'll give it another go one day when I am ready to drop some coin on a BBQ sammy."}
{"text":"The kids wanted to take dad out for Father's Day and dad picked here.  Food was absolutely wonderful!  Started with the smoked wings (so moist and tasty) and the slider combo (brisket, shredded chicken, beef and turkey).  They were great, but I loved the turkey - again, super juicy and moist. The kids had mini corn dogs and the chicken tenders and they both enjoyed their food.  Dad had the burnt ends over rice and was over the moon.  The simplicity of the white rice with the flavor of the brisket was out of this world.  I had the burnt ends sammy, and again, unbelievably good.  This is now our go to place even though it is out of our way.  Life is too short to eat anything but the best!  And the server was so nice, funny and attentive (thanks for verifying that Kiss did the song Beth).  We will be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it!! My son says it's the best mac and cheese he has had down here (Fort Mill area)--he is a connoisseur of M&C, of course :) Service was great with a wide selection of food. I had the regular pulled pork BBQ. It had good flavor alone and they had four sauces: the standard SC-based mustard sauce, the eastern NC spicy vinegar, the western NC piedmont sweet BBQ, and their own signature sauce. I tried the mustard and signature ones. I LOVED the signature sauce!!! It was like all the other three combined into one and was fabulous :) And last, but not least, you should know that the hushpuppies taste like Funyuns! That was a surprise!! Ha!   My suggestion would be a smaller selection of sides that are all homemade. Too many choices is not always a positive thing, and can take away from the authenticity of a place. Plus, you can make them signature dishes that only can be found at your restaurant...always good for business :)"}
{"text":"It's ok for a quick bite. Kind of pricey though.  Counter ordering.   Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We have dined at Fort Mill BBQ since their original opening.  We like the new look and the improved feel of a restaurant setting including the service on china as opposed to food in baskets, and a feel of grab and go.  We like the expanded menu with more options including the smoked wings.  I also like having many side options and often order vegetables.  The added salad choices are another good addition.  But, we dined at the restaurant today.  Some of the changes in the menu and the food served is lacking.  The barbecue meat was good but a bit dry.  The bun was stale.  I do not remember the last time I ate a stale bun.  In fact, white processed buns last a while.  The baked beans are good but now have a kick.  The original baked beans were good.  Why mess with good?  I also miss the option of having a vegetable soup, especially in the cold months, now replaced with Brunswick stew.  And, normally, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  Today was a different experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful bbq restaurant! I had the pulled pork w/ffs and fried sweet corn fritters. Oh my stars! I could have made a meal just off the corn cakes that came with honey butter to dip in! Wonderful and SUPER friendly. Generous portions. Definitely will be going back with the family!"}
{"text":"Fort Mill Barbeque is well worth to try. We went to celebrate a birthday.  Our waitress was friendly and when she saw we had presents and cupcakes, she asked if it was someone's birthday. She then informed us the birthday person gets as free meal credit up to $11. All he had to do was give his name and birthday so they could keep track.  The food was okay. I ordered the quarter smoked chicken with collard greens and fried corn maque choux.  The chicken was dark meat and the skin was pretty crispy, but there was no seasoning on it. Inside it was pretty tender. I dipped the chicken in their mustard bbq sauce and that was pretty good. I wish the collards had a little more vinegar and fat. At first I thought there was no ham in it until I found a tiny piece, but at least that means it was healthier for me to it. My favorite part was the corn maque choux.  It was a generous portion and I like the kick that the spicy sausage adds.   This was lunch time on a Saturday and we were the only ones in the restaurant, but we enjoyed the quiet environment.  The space is a little small.   We enjoyed the experience and service,  but I personally enjoy other bbq more."}
{"text":"Another fantastic lunch! Food & service both excellent. Regular Pull Pork BBQ plate with house Mac & Cheese. Server informed me about their growlers as well, hope to take home a couple on my next visit."}
{"text":"It wasn't the best BBQ we've ever had, and it wasn't the worst! I got the BBQ sandwich, it had a lot of fat in it and the coleslaw wasn't very flavorful! I also thought it was a little pricey for the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Good variety in menu. Food was good and reasonably priced. Good beer selection. Ladies night on Thursdays with half-priced drinks."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly but this is some awful BBQ.  At one point they opened a place off of Carowinds.  The food there was awesome and the staff was great.  The MGR was a total dumby and a loser but they show they have potential.  Too bad the BBQ is nasty.  By far, the worst BBQ I have ever had."}
{"text":"i've eaten here twice - first time it was okay - thought it was an off day - tried it again, no thanks you can tell from the pictures you get a very small portion (school cafeteria size) one of the owners is rude and full of himself - i complained and he didn't care... quality is not great it is so so and expensive for the portion"}
{"text":"First off, the restaurant was clean, from the tables, floors, bar, and the restrooms.  If the bathroom is clean you know the kitchen will be clean.  The good is reasonably priced.  The 2 meat combo will be my lunch because the portion size was more than expected.  The staff was friendly.  The brisket was meaty and not fatty while the pulled pork was very flavorful, even without adding one of their 4 sauces.  Like anywhere try it, if you like it, come back and support a local restaurant."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and being from Texas, I ordered the large Beef Brisket plate as I haven't had GOOD brisket in a long time.  Well as it turns out, I still haven't. The beef brisket was not good and way overpriced.  It looked like it was a day or two old. It tasted very bland and cardboardish. For $15.99 a plate I was not happy at all. The sides I had, fries and fried okra were your run of the mill frozen type so there is really nothing here worth a second shot.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"I have tried Fort Mill's BBQ once before at a barbecue festival in Asheville of all places but this week, I finally had the chance to try their restaurant.  The restaurant is not a fancy place but for good 'cue, I don't expect or want fancy.  Fancy means fancy prices and you don't need that to have good food.  So you step up to the counter and order from the various selections, grab your drink, sit and they bring out your order.     First off, let me start off by saying the staff here is fantastic.  Everyone was friendly, willing to help you with anything...whether your order, taking away your trash, making sure your table had all of their 4 sauces, etc.  Outstanding job on the service!  For food, I ordered the pork barbecue plate, mac n cheese and fries.  The 'cue was amazing.  I've said it before that the best barbecue can stand on it's own and doesn't need to be smothered in sauce and that is the case here.  Great flavor and I could definitely taste the spice mixture they used on the pork.  The mac n cheese was ok.  The cheese was good but the mac just didn't do anything for me.  But the fries were great.  Crispy, good flavor and didn't need any salt or ketchup.    Overall, great job FMBBQ.  I will definitely come back and also look for you at area festivals."}
{"text":"This year at the newly-renamed BBQ & Blues festival: http://www.yelp.com/biz/time-warner-cable-bbq-and-blues-charlotte  We decided to again check out the Fort Mill pork sandwich, since we thought they had a decent offering last year.  Unfortunately, this time around they were pretty nasty.  I think a lot of the problem is that the sandwiches seemed to have been sitting around for a long time.  The buns were cold, the meat was cold, it really was not a good experience at all.  Others were handing out samples and seemed to be preparing things as ordered, but Fort Mill was taking a different approach, and making sandwiches and letting them sit.  Perhaps when things picked up they would be better, but not while we were there."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter thinks he is Gordon Ramsey. They tell me about a 20% off rib special and then qualify it after I order. We waited so long we might as well dined in."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 pulled pork BBQ plates and some side ribs.  The wait for a take-out order was 40 minutes because they claimed to be so busy, but when we walked in there were no customers at the tables and the staff was standing around chatting. The BBQ was tender and flavorful, but also a little fatty and \"gristly\" in part.  As referenced in other reviews the country baked beans were clearly out of a can and this was disappointing because they used to serve thick, hearty beans.  The ribs were meaty but very salty and had a bacon flavor that I wasn't crazy about.  The Texas toast is two soggy pieces of bread lathered with butter.  Cost was on the high side. Overall decent because of the pulled pork but the other issues bring it down a notch."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Fort Mill BBQ on a Saturday.  The restaurant was about 1/3 to 1/2 full.  You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.  I ordered the three meat combo as I wanted to try all the meats, pork, brisket, and ribs.  Combo plates also come with two sides.  I got the mac n cheese and baked beans.  It was pretty pricey at $18.50, but not out of line with other BBQ restaurants.  My food came out pretty quickly.    There was a good size portion of pork & ribs (3 bones), but the brisket portion was pretty skimpy, only two slices of brisket.  Also the ribs had a mustard based sauce brushed on them and were sitting on top of the brisket so that the sauce dripped down on the brisket.  I'm not too picky, but I do like to choose which sauce goes on which meat.  The ribs were very disappointing.  They were cooked enough to be done, but nowhere near long enough to be any good.  I couldn't really taste any smoke flavor and there was no smoke ring visible.  Eating these ribs was like eating a pork chop.   The brisket was tender and moist with a nice smoke ring.  The flavor was also pretty good.  I just wished they had given me more than two slices.  Also the mustard BBQ sauce that had dripped on them was also not the best.  The pulled pork was a good sized portion and looked good with visible pieces of bark.  It was a little dry, but just barely.  The flavor was pretty good.  They had several types of sauces on the table, a thin vinegar based sauce, a mustard based sauce, what looked to be a mustard/tomato combo and a tomato based sauce.  All of the sauces were pretty good, I liked the mustard/tomato combo the best.  The mac n cheese was very good.  It is homemade and baked in an oven.  The serving I got had a lot of the melted brown cheese from the top in it and was great.  The baked beans looked and tasted like they had just been spooned out of a can.  I could see that they had tried to spice them up a little, but that attempt failed.    Overall my visit was OK.  If I came back I would skip the ribs and brisket and just get a pulled pork sandwich.  But I probably won't be back as there are much better BBQ places to go to."}
{"text":"Incredible food, quick and impeccable service! Staff actually takes their time to make sure you order the best for you! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If I could go zero or negative stars, I would.   This place has been around for quite some time and the \"fact\" they have won BBQ contests is laughable - unless they have been competing with the area Elementary school cafeterias.  I will be the first to admit....I am a bbq brisket snob. There is no good bbq brisket in the state of SC and I have tried them all so save your breath (Jim & Nicks is tolerable as long as you don't mind the possibility of a brisket sandwich w more fat than meat, but I digress). This place's brisket is abysmal and the fact they charge $14 for a \"regular\" plate is a disgrace.  The counter folks are very nice and quite personable - very friendly. But that's it.   I purchased a brisket plate to go with mac n cheese, baked beans and Texas Toast (another joke). I didn't look at the order before I got home, but when I did, I truly thought it was a mistake - it was, but on my part for going there.  Seriously - maybe 10 small bites of brisket and half of it was inedible because it was nothing but fat.  The bbq beans tasted like they were straight from the can!! If you read the other reviews here, the best thing anyone has to say about this place is its mac n cheese....which was ok, nothing great.   I will never eat here again - sorry I need something better at my bbq restaurants that tolerable mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner to-go on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant is located in a little strip shopping area just past the intersection of Gold Hill Rd. and 160.  The interior is well-lit and I was greeted from the counter as I walked in.  The menu is your standard bbq fare with only glaring exception (IMO).  There was no pulled poultry on the menu.  No chicken or turkey.  The only poultry on a bun on the menu was a chicken breast sandwich.  I ordered the regular pork sandwich to-go which came with one side.  I chose mac n cheese for the side and some sweet tea to drink.  The total came to $8.95.  While my order was being prepared, I fixed my tea from the self-serve beverages.  The tea wasn't all that sweet for my liking, but it wet my whistle.  My food was ready to go in probably seven minutes or so.  When I got home, I found a rather large amount of pork on a bun with the sauce on the side, along with a healthy serving of the mac n cheese.  The pork was great, although there wasn't enough sauce in the little tub for me to sufficiently soak my sandwich.  The mac n cheese was pretty good.  A little on the rich side, but manageable.  This place is a definite come-backer.  The food and the friendly service is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often, the bbq is fantastic!  They used to give larger portions, now they are pretty strict on measuring it out, but still good.  My wife loves the Mac and cheese! She always gets double order.  The reason for the 4 star rating is for the wings, not much to them, small, not much meat.  Flavor is good, but just small and no meat.  Don't think I will order again."}
