{"text":"I'm not sure why the rating is low. The food is ok, I mean it's what you'd expect for a buffet. It is clean and the staff are friendly. Overall fair value for money."}
{"text":"I will never go back here again.  

The layout is terrible. Imagine trying to eat your food while someone's butt is a foot from your plate because they are leaning over a freezer trying to get ice cream.

The buffet is so cramped there isn't room for two people side by side. Most people will try to squeeze around you and end up shoving you into the food.

How are people expected to enjoy a meal in a situation like this? It was a negative experience for me, I could not leave that place fast enough.

The food is ok, and doesn't make up for the overall experience. I noticed a clump of hair stuck to the ginger beef tongs and avoided most items after that.

The rice was ok. At least I am pretty sure there was no hair in it.

The best part was leaving. I wouldn't go again even if it was free."}
{"text":"I only give them  1 star  because 0 is not an option 
Absolutely horrible   I felt like I was in China  and didn't speak chinesse  rude horrible mean witch on the phone  
After I asked for delivery well apparently  they don't deliver on monday  
Then I asked where  they ar located  and she was short and rude after I said it's Ok I can find it     she just hung up on me  
I'm sure  with that kind of staff  the food can only be worse  
I will never go there ever  again  and I will tell everybody I know  not to also  there is a few other quality spots  in the general neighborhood 
Do not support  these rude people"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service wasn't that great. Went in to grab lunch to go and they were having a lunch buffet. Advised the lady at the front counter when I walked in, it was to go. She said \"okay\" and walked off. Didn't know what to do, so stood there. She walked to the kitchen, walked out with a to go container. I then followed her since she stood at the buffet. She then asked me what I wanted. I could have 1 meat item, 1 veggie item and then rice or noodles. I told her what I wanted, she put it together, closed the container and walked back to the front counter and told me the price. I paid and left. Not overly friendly and this was my first time here. A few things: you pay the full lunch buffet price however can't pick what you want or the quantity???? Very strange since the container is the small average size and with buffets you can eat how much you want when you are there . Why you can't serve yourself or if you want more veggies, be allowed too or maybe even have both, rice and noodles? Imagine that. Why they have limitations on what can be \" to go\", I have no idea? The food was okay, not great but the service could be allot better as well as more options for people like me who eat on the go. If you are going to charge full buffet price, give customers options and some choice!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, as it is close to home.  My wife doesn't like Chinese, so I rarely get to eat it, but she wasn't hungry one night and I was, so I went.  I arrived and I was standing awkwardly with a man who had yet to be addressed; (he was waiting for pick-up) and was asked by the hostess three times if we were together.  She didn't understand when we were not, but I was eventually seated after probably five minutes of awkward silence between me and some random retiree in the entirely too small foyer with nothing to say to each other and growing hungrier by the minute.  When I finally got my seat, it took a few minutes to get my drink.  It took several more minutes for food, which was delicious and the only reason I can justify giving this place two stars.  -2 stars for the service, 4 stars for the food.  I found it really weird that I didn't get any chopsticks, and for me part of eating Chinese is eating it with chopsticks, but  I got past it and ate with a fork.  Nobody paid any attention to me for the duration of my meal or thereafter.  I had to flag a server down to get a bill, and then probably 20 minutes later after I was fed up with waiting for her to bring the machine, I paid up front, but I was not told I could.  I was just hoping, and lo and behold I could, thank god, or I would have been there all night.  It's as though they didn't even know I was there."}
{"text":"The food is the saving grace here for 3 stars.. we would never come to eat here inside. The space is awkward and the decor is meh, bland. We did go in for take out anyways but I am being generous in saying that the service was 2 star.
We ordered my fave dish, Singapore noodles and we got the good measure of a good Chinese resto IMO, the House Special fried rice. Both rung in at just under $20 which was nice for a change.
The rice was really good. I would go there just to get that again. It was well done and not greasy. That portion lasted 2 meals.
The noodles were dryer than I would have liked and sparse on the shrimp. I had to doctor up the noodles a bit with more curry, salt and chiles. The dish has a HOT symbol next to it on the menu but this is just not so. However, if I am at home to fix it, I would rather have my dish under seasoned than over. That said, in having to fix the dish, I will not order that here again.
The good news is that after eating this food, our tummies did not have the terrible rumblies.
Not a bad choice or take out - they do have dinner for 1, 2, 3, 4 people which I do like."}
{"text":"Have been to a lot of dim sum and buffet places for Asian food before. The food at this place was great! Super fresh, can tell the chef takes pride in his work. They brought out small quantities to prevent things from getting old and overdue... smart! Both the dum sum and the Chinese buffet tastes really good. Can actually taste the different flavors in the dishes (unlike some Chinese places where everything tastes the same). Happy to come
Back for lunch and probably try some delivery."}
{"text":"Awful service as noted by others, very cramped and outdated layout for such a new shopping centre. Only accepts visa and debit ... No thanks!"}
{"text":"Don't get your hopes up for quality Dim Sum here.  I've been here twice now and Dim Sum offerings are not abundant and quality just isn't there.  The offerings at T&T market are much better!!   This is Dim Sum only in the restaurant name!!

The Dim Sum offerings are sparse and bland, suffering badly from too much time on the steam table. No Har Gow, no steamed or baked buns, no rice noodles, no beef balls or congee.  They only have Shu Mai, rubs in black bean sauce, bean curd rolls and their version of sticky rice which is just gluttonous rice with no stuffing or any of \"the good stuff\" that should be there.  The rest of the food is glorified western style Chinese food deep fried or over sauced and again suffering from steam table over exposure..

My rule for bad experiences is try twice before reviewing and that's what I've done here..

Calgary has some really good Dim Sum restaurants this isn't one..  Save your money and use it wisely at one of them or just get take out from T&T you'll be happier.  There's a lot of competition for your dining dollars in this plaza this restaurant as a long way to go to get mine ever again!!"}
{"text":"From 4 stars to 1 star!  Why, you ask?  Well, we decided to go for dinner tonight.  The restaurant opens at 4:30 p.m. so why not hit up the restaurant for an early dinner.  We get there and there are 2 tables already eating.  I'm not sure how 'cos we got there at about 4:40 p.m.  I could see only one waitress running the front desk, taking orders and also taking the take-out orders.  We waited till about 5 p.m. before we got our order taken.  Then, she screwed up on the order.  We ordered 4 dishes and only got 3 of the 4 dishes. She accused us of not ordering but she found out that she forgot to add the 4th dish to the order for the kitchen.  The 4th dish was a chicken dish and another waitress (there was more wait staff after 5 p.m.) who came to our table to somewhat apologize and say that the kitchen thought that the chicken was so full of bones so they couldn't serve it to us.  Well, why didn't you come and tell us?  Why did we have to wait so long before it was discovered that you forgot our dish?  Pretty bad customer service.  Either you have to hire more people to help out in the restaurant or do not open the restaurant till you have staff to handle the business.  There, I said my piece.  Won't be back at all!"}
