{"text":"I didn't mean to go to Freshii for lunch the other day, but events conspired in such a way that I was in the neighbourhood (hoping to buy a Indie Coffee Pass from Crema Coffee - but they were sold out) and the line was short (because their debit was down) and my stomach decided it was time to eat.  After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)  I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.  If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of \"Chef Creations\" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).  The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...  Just a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook. Maybe it's me, but I'm just going to blame them on this one."}
{"text":"Quickly became a staple and the go to place for half of my office.  Simple, fast, flavourful and Good for you!  If this was the standard for fast food the world would be a better place."}
{"text":"Bland, boring, slightly overpriced food - how perfectly fitting for the Yonge/St. Clair corridor.  Harsh, maybe, but I have given Freshii many chances and have never failed to be underwhelmed.    It's healthy, I suppose, but just not very good."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally be able to try Freshii since I was in Vaughan and don't have one near me. Totally disappointed. From service to food. Only the decor is great.   My first time here and the menu is rotating on the screen so I can't see it all. I asked the woman at the counter for a menu. She pointed to the screen. I said yes, but it's rotating so I can't see it all. She handed me a three sided tabletop brochure that had three different menu items on it. The line was getting long behind me so I ordered the chilli salad off the picture which had avocado on it. That plus a drink and tax was $12.14. Wow! Expensive for fast food but I thought ok, there's avocado.  Watched my salad being made behind the glass. Watery chili. Romaine lettuce. 7 halves of cherry tomatoes. A spoonful of corn. Spoonful of shredded carrot. A whole handful of green onion which was totally overpowering. And spoonful of cheese. Then she shook the plastic bag the food was in, which totally wilted the lettuce and bruised all the tomatoes. I asked her about the avocado. She said I didn't order it. I said its in the picture. She said, no, extra. I said the young woman at the front desk didn't tell me that she just showed me the picture. The blonde woman who had made my salad pointed behind me to a table along the wall and said next time, check the menu.   I was so shocked at the bad customer service I took my food and sat down. I ate the salad. It was ok - not very special.   I was very excited about this brand when I read about it. Totally disappointed. And the staff at this location is SO unfriendly that I won't ever come here. And I don't think I'll try another one in Toronto.   Too bad. One bad experience made me ai upset, I actually spent these last few minutes posting about it! Thumbs down."}
{"text":"This was a fall back place for my workplace crew. Recent changes to the menu, dumbed down in choice and also in flavour. My favourite lemongrass, spicy Thai soup is now a flavourless assembly of ingredients. Spoonful of chicken or tofu, mushrooms, sprouts-check. Sprig of coriander-check, cup of noodles-check. Delicious lemongrass broth, sorely missing.  Big change, amazing how you can just sense the change of quality in the change of decor. Not sure why, new ownership maybe? I'm curious because The Loving Hut which is at essentially the same address has also changed - for the worse. I'm going to have to find out if one owner took over both places, they are franchises after all. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Lately I'm favouring the brown rice chicken teriyaki bowl from Freshii for lunch. It is a very large portion for under $8, and they keep portions of sriracha at the cash - get one and add it into your bowl, it adds some very necessary heat! Without it the dish is very one note, sweet teriyaki is all you taste.  I love this option which is just as tasty as Teriyaki Experience but even healthier due to the brown rice (which in my opinion tastes even better and nuttier!) The veggies it comes with are broccoli, carrot and mushrooms but I sub edamame for the mushrooms. Yum!"}
{"text":"I eat here quite often for lunch.  The owner is really nice and always says hello.  The selection of toppings for your salad is pretty large.  One complaint is that they don't really give you enough chicken for the price you pay.  They also need a better selection of salad dressing, especially in the low fat category."}
{"text":"Quality is fine but I'm not ever again paying $14 for a salad and a water. Effen ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"I work at the airport, and have waiting in many long lines at this location waiting to order a frozen yogurt.  Once I get to the front,  I'm told once again, the machine isn't working.  This had happened at least 12 times.  No sign or indication that the machine is once again not working.  At least put a sign or something indicating that the machine isn't working once again.  Or stop advertising frozen yogurt and smoothies at this location.    Also, the staff at this location are some of the rudest customer service employees I've ever come across. It seems they absolutely hate their jobs, and the customers are a complete annoyance by ordering.   1 star is being generous."}
{"text":"Dynamite!!! Great food! Very fast! Surprised it's not kore busy to be honest. I'm usually not a fan of these over priced wanna be healthy establishments but I will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Great fresh healthy food options. Fast and easy to grab before a flight. Staff not so friendly!"}
{"text":"I finally went in there to create my own salad and was bummed  out by the time I got back to my office.  Wasn't the freshest ingredients and they drenched the whole thing in dressing (even though I indicated half). Paid like $15 for it. Barely any chick peas, avocado or even black olives. Mostly spinach resting wet at the bottom.  I'm giving it two stars cause I actually love the decor and set up. But the food.. nah."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. Why? If you are trying to eat healthy and you work in Uptown, then this is the place to go. The problem is, as usual healthy isn't fast or cheap. I usually get a fresh squeezed juice and a bag of yogurt pretzels. Hey, that IS healthy for this junk food junkie! They have named their salads and wraps with some interesting names like ninja and superbiotic. The company may think that is clever marketing, but that won't fool me into eating it. The rumors are true, during a week day lunch time, the lines are long and the staff seem to turnover all the time so when I order my juice they all seem to look at each other like 'who's doing this order?'. Uhm, throw some fruit and veg in the juicer and press the On button please. My mysterious looking green drink and a bag of 6 pretzels costs $7.50. What? Hey, that is the price for eating healthy.   TIP: the place is open early for breakfast and shuts at 4pm. So after 5pm, it's time to toss those greens and head for the cocktail bar or cupcake shop!"}
{"text":"Leshii  I was feeling all fly looking like peshii  Wanting something to eat that was freshii  It was good and so so tast-shii  Inside was gush-ii but outside was leaf-ii  It had beans, cheese, rice and shit-akiis  I had to get it down my deep throat like my name was lex-ii  One pump two pump three pump and it got mess-ii  So juice-ii that it stained my kha-khiis  I was satisfied the long thick wrap was in my bell-ii"}
{"text":"Healthy and vegetarian friendly option in the Overstreet Mall.  Love the \"make your own bowl\" options filled with items like kale and quinoa!  Also like the vegan chili.  Can be really challenging to find a quick, healthy lunch in Uptown Charlotte.  Freshii hits the mark!   One star off for speed of service"}
{"text":"As someone who does not eat there often it was not bad. I enjoyed the Teriyaki Twist bowl and soup. I have tried their salads previously and was not a fan. I am more of a mcdonalds salads fan lol. The prices were not that bad but if I was going to pay that price I will spend it at manchu wok"}
{"text":"Second time around getting the same thing that I ordered the first time because it was really good! I always get the Teriyaki Twist Bowl. At first, the bowl just looks like a mountain of plain vegetables, which i'm not a fan of. But when mixed, the Teriyaki sauce really complements all of the vegetables included in the bowl. All of the vegetables are super fresh, my favourite is the Edamame.   I also always order Freshii because Ritual makes it super easy to order so that it's ready when I get there and there are often deals with Freshii that makes the bowl worth it! I just don't know how healthy this bowl is at it has a ton of Teriyaki sauce. If you're not a sauce person, then I don't recommend this. But for me it was perfect, definitely not my last time."}
{"text":"This place is located at the business school on the ASU campus. Because of classes at night and no other options except a few things at the MU at night when I had classes, this was the place to be. You can choose from burritos, salads, wraps, and bowls. Somehow each time I wound up spending at least $9-$10.  The food looks great but when you eat it, most of the options leave more to be desired. What would otherwise sound like an amazing meal, like a Thai Lemon Grass Burrito, always had me wondering where the lemon flavor was. It was aspects like that that left me give a 4 star review.  The people running the place don't seem too bad. I always caught them between 6-9 at night so maybe that has a factor to play. Every time I walk in they're welcoming, smiling, and ready to take my order. They make their food right there in front of you. You might not be able to pick and choose what you want on everything but you can substitute components, etc.  Some of these reviews are funny because they clearly show that people weren't paying attention to what they ordered and the ability to see exactly what they're doing to make your order (think of it like how you can see what they're doing at Subway). And every single restaurant is unsustainable in some way. They wrap your meal up in paper if you get a burrito or wrap, only for you to toss it away later...who's unsustainable then? I guess some of these reviews are freshman in their 101 classes who are out to change the world."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Freshii locations, I do like the food they offer there but, I find this location to be not so great. I find they're inconsistent with my orders. Such as missing ingredients, or a completely different dressing in my salads. I'm usually not too picky and I'll just accept it and eat it, but I've ordered the same salad three separate times, and they've all been different! Now unfortunately I've been avoiding this location for other reasons. Simply put, the manager is rude. Many occasions of unfriendly service and attitude. No thanks."}
{"text":"I ordered Tex Mex Burrito ($7.25) and the Freshii Green Smoothie (5.99). The burrito has brown rice, avocado, aged cheddar, black beans, corn, salsa fresca, greek yogurt ranch; to me, it was mediocre at best. Nothing about it really stood out.   The real reason to come here is because of the smoothie. In the drink is kale, spinach, pineapple, avocado, low-fat frozen yogurt. I really like how fresh their smoothies are and that they also use frozen yogurt in their smoothies.   The staff is very nice, but food may take a while during lunch time.   I feel like I can easily from similar products at Freshii for a cheaper price at any other restaurant. This place is okay, just not for me."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed by this place. I get the Oaxaca bowl because it explodes with flavor and texture. It's great too for green juices. Definitely don't feel guilty when I eat here."}
{"text":"I love freshii but this location piles on the salad dressing. Every time I get a salad it's swimming in dressing. I will always ask for not so much dressing but it's always the same thing.  The line up is always quick so I appreciate that for be able to get back to the office in time after lunch. I would recommend going to the location at Church and Wellesley for a healthier salad."}
{"text":"Never get their green juices. Its pre made and placed in the fridge for purchase. The juice was bland and it tasted like something I could make at home. For almost $7, it is not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Healthy food gets them up to three.  At least the food tasted real, and not very processed.  As a person who takes healthy food very seriously, this is important to me.  That being said, the Freshii Bowl I ordered was a little heavy on the brown rice, and didn't have enough veggies or protein to be perfect.  All in all, it was good.  It tasted great.  The problems are twofold.  I was in there for half an hour to forty minutes.  During that time, there were two songs on rotation.  Two songs.  It's enough to drive you insane.  Sure they were decent indie rock tunes but man, I must have heard them each seven or eight times.  The other problem is their gift cards and their stamp cards.  The stamp cards are only good for a calendar month, so if you are lucky enough to start on the first, and eat there all the time, you might get one (maybe two if you go every other day) loyalty reward meals.  It's hardly worth carrying the card.  Their gift cards expire pretty darn fast too, like 3 months or so.  I had a fifty dollar gift card I almost lost out on.  But.... at least it's not deep fried or made from mystery meat."}
{"text":"Had the Pangoa bowl today.   It's absolutely disgusting and was surprisingly unhealthy (tasted like bad/fake asian food). I guess I was expecting something healthy from a place called \"Freshii\", but what I got was a bowl of rice drowned in BBQ sauce with some other toppings.   I don't think the servers varied my order from the way it was intended to be made. It's just a terrible choice if you're looking for a light/healthy bowl. I really regretted not going to IQ, Kupfert&Kim, or even Longo's or Ollie's for their salad bars instead. Maybe the other food choices are better, but I'm pretty turned off Freshii now.   Don't get the Pangoa unless you're a big fan of rice drowned in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I just noticed the bad review here, and found it pretty absurd. I actually love this place, as do all my co-workers. We have been going here for about a year now, and haven't had any issues at all. It's probably the best healthy choice for lunch in the King W. neighbourhood. The staff are always friendly and the place is really well run."}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience in Toronto. Shocked when the surly attendant grunted at me following the placement of an order (I chose straight from the menu and made no requests for customizations). After handling my money and touching equipment nearby the cash register the attendant proceeded to prepare food without washing hands or putting on gloves. Additionally, the take away food container was thrown down behind a sink as rice was prepared. Given the rest of the food preparation was to happen out of sight I immediately called the attendant over and requested my money back. I advised I would never return to this location. On the way out, two patrons asked what had happened and, on hearing the service experience, reflected that this location is known for bad service.  Freshii - I love your franchise, but do something about this location. They are ruining your brand."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often, but only because there are not better options around for this kind of meal (e.g., rice bowls). The name may make you think of Fresh (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fresh-toronto-6#query:fresh%20juice%20for%20life) , and the menus are similar, although Fresh's is much larger. They both have design-your-own salads, rice bowls, and wraps.   The difference, though, is that at Freshii the flavour is simply not there. The basic ingredients are OK, but the sum they add up to is always a bit blah.   If you want to experience this kind of thing done right, go to Fresh. If that is too far, Fresh can be your poor second choice."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Prefer Chipotle's wraps over Freshiis. The thing that stood out was the cold and unwelcoming attitude of management and awkward staff. Welcoming, friendly and respectful service is a big part of eating out for me. This place needs to work on that."}
{"text":"This is my second review for Freshii, just because I want to reiterate how great this place is! The service is unbelievably friendly and accommodating, and the food is not only healthy, but super tasty too. To top it all off, it's super affordable too. Easy 5 stars in my opinion. Would recommend it easily :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food, very filling, healthy and reasonable prices. The wait for the food isn't long and the staff are really friendly. I've been a regular customer and would definitely recommend this place if someone is looking for good, healthy and quick meals."}
{"text":"First time Freshii goer, loved the smoothie and smokehouse burrito! Brought my sister's from Atlanta and they can't wait to find the Freshii near them. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I work in the mall, and every time I eat here, I enjoy it. It's so nice to find such fresh food, and it's quick. The staff is always friendly, and make a point to ask how your meal is. I've had salads, wraps, bowls, and soups, and everything is delicious. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Fast, heathly and a ton for the money. It is the best lunch or dinner in the area"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were on the hunt for something light and fresh and this place fulfilled that craving for us.  It is a simple and cool space decorated with small colorful frames with veggies on them. They have a nice and easy to read menu divided in panels, for what I remembered seeing they have salads, wraps, burritos, noodles bowls and green smoothies. Each panel describes all the ingredients that come in every item and at the bottom you get to choose your meat, they have steak, chicken, tofu or vegetarian. For me, that's a good break from the rest of the places where you get dizzy just by looking at their long and confusing menus.  Getting to the best part, I got a chicken wrap called the superbiotic, it comes with bell peppers, spinach, chick peas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes (which I would have preferred rehydrated, they felt like a bumpy road in my mouth) and a cucumber dill dressing, everything tasted nice and fresh (as the name states, freshii). My hubby got a steak burrito and he said it was ok, he though it needed some kind of dressing since it just came with a little bit of avocado and beans. They also got natural juices and coconut water (I got one) and I liked it a lot, the brand was Buddha, it was from Thailand. I will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Stay away from their \"best seller\" the Warrior Chicken Bowl as much as you can. It is a big bowl of rice with very little veggie, all-right amount of chicken, but absolutely too much ranch dressing. The dressing mixed so well with the rice, making it too heavy. I can't relate to this poorly designed dish to healthy eating. I finished half bowl, and after 10 hours, still feel too much burden on my stomach. Ironically, I enjoy heavy food, but  the Warrior Chicken is beyond what I can take.   The order came surprisingly fast. It took less a minute for me to get the bowl. Limited seats as previous posts mentioned."}
{"text":"This location is the worst I have been to. They do not put enough dressing and toppings on the bowls. It's just a big bowl of bland brown rice. Not sure if this is to save on costs but all other locations seem to have abundant toppings and flavour."}
{"text":"I walked in there after my yoga class and had a salad with BBQ chicken. It was a pretty large portion with fresh mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, and corn topped with chicken.  Overall I think there are 4-5 of your daily servings of veggies and one serving of protein.    Also, I enjoyed that the \"healthy\" greens came with the \"junky\" taste of BBQ - you get a taste of the guilty pleasure.     The place is clean, service fast and friendly. Their cutlery and containers are very biodegradable. I like."}
{"text":"I love Freshii. I personally hate cooking for myself, so I go to Freshii a couple of times a week to avoid this chore.  The food at Freshii is pretty good and decently priced. The staff is also really friendly, and you are sure to get your food quickly."}
{"text":"I've been to Freshii a bunch of times and I normally enjoy it! I go here fairly often as the food's decent, there's ample seating indoors/outside, and, it's one of the few \"healthy\" options around for lunch. I'm giving it a 2 star rating, as my recent experience wasn't as good as it normally is, and the customer service was frustrating (to say the least!).  Interaction:  Me - (After I had just given her my lunch order, with the words \"COBB WRAP\" written clearly on it) \"Cobb Wrap, please\"  Freshii employee- \"Would you like a salad, or wrap?\"  Me - \"Wrap\"  Freshii employee - \"Salad or wrap?\"  Me - \"Wrap\"  Freshii employee - (Yes, she asked...again) \"Salad or wrap?\"  Me - \"Um...I've said Wrap 3 times...and it's written on the order I just gave you, so wrap, please!\"  And...finally, after this unpleasant back and fourth interaction (which included a nice roll of the eyes!), she made my wrap.  All in all, the food was just \"OK\" this time, and, to add to the experience, the service was a bit rough. I seriously hope that this was just a \"one-time\" thing!"}
{"text":"I really find their food here delicious but I can't justify paying $15 for takeout salad. Plus, I have doubts as to how ' fresh ' their stuff is. We have ordered their food for our office meetings so many times and I find it weird how many of us got sick afterwards. And by the way, I follow them on twitter and what they give away for free if you mention their tweet, is really a joke. It's something like an ounce of mango with your salad purchase."}
{"text":"I had never been to Freshii, I had only read about it coming to Madison, but alas have never dined in. Today's visit, my first visit to freshii, was to purchase a few gift cards (so still no dining). But the impression the owner made was remarkable. And I will be back to patronize his restaurant. I believe his name is Jack, the owner. He rang up my two gift cards, as I tried to keep interaction to a minimum--fighting a cold and I didn't want to share germs or my raspy voice. As I was about to part, he offered me a sample of a Freshii smoothie. I'm not sure if it was because he sensed the sicky in my voice, or if he randomly selected me to offer, but that small gesture--as I was sick and wiped out--made a world of difference in my day. I will definitely be back and look forward to perusing the menu."}
{"text":"Love the food at Freshii - so many fantastic options, I have yet to be disappointed!! I have found this location slow at times, however when we have placed an order for my workplace it has always been on time."}
{"text":"FINALLY, this location is open. Walked into a super friendly row of staff just waiting to help us. I ordered the Pangoa Rice Bowl and the Freshi Green Smoothie. They also offer wraps, salads and juices, and cater to lactose/gluten free and vegetarian crowd as well. Love having a quick heathy option that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Staff are happy to answer any questions you have about their menu. There are a few spots to sit if you want to eat in. Takeout bowls, and cutlery are all made of compostable corn!  Can't wait for the location near me on Southland Drive to open up!"}
{"text":"I ate at this Freshii location twice this week. This location is very tiny with few tables. I also found there's not really a good spot to stand while waiting for you order - you kind of have to hover around the tables where other people are eating - it's a bit awkward.  I have had good experiences with Freshii in the past - I like that I can get a healthy meal fast and that I can customize it. this week however, I didn't feel as satisfied with my lunches. Here is what I had:  Mon- custom salad -  It was very big and filling. however i ordered goat cheese which is an extra $1.50 and there was hardly any in my salad. also in total my meal was like $12 for salad and a bottle of water - it was good and big -but portion size doesn't really impress me. I'd rather it be smaller and cheaper.   Weds- \"burrito\" - it says burrito on the menu, but don't be fooled - it's not a burrito. It's a wrap full of rice -with a random piece of vegetable here and there - I think this meal was about $9 - not worth it - get  a salad."}
{"text":"Summary:  Overpriced, boring and skimpy salads.  Details:  I work in the office tower above Freshii, and tried it a few times for a lunchtime salad.  The salads are not very good, and they are skimpy with the ingredients. To top it off, it is expensive.   I used to work downtown, and would go to Fast Fresh Foods in Commerce Court for salad at least 2 times a week. They aren't cheap (about 8-9 dollars), but I usually would be satisfied for the rest of the day until dinner, and the ingredients were good, salads were tasty, and the line moved quickly.  When I came up to College, I gave Freshii a try. They have at times been excrutiatingly slow, they are super cheap with the toppings - a normal salad leaves me feeling hungry right after lunch - and it is more expensive (10-12 dollars)."}
{"text":"Cheap, healthy food.  Great wraps, interesting brown rice bowls, and an occasional frozen yogurt.  If you're a sucker for membership cards keep in mind that it expires at the end of the month, so get your free wrap before it runs out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their banana crunch is great and their vegan chili is delightful. Some bland dishes but overall a nice place to eat at."}
{"text":"Came here and i thought i would try the Tex Mex steak burrito for the first time. Have to to say it was just awful and dry. No flavour, didn't look appealing and tastes of nothing! Started eating our burritos and nether of us could take more than two bites. It was disgusting. So we just threw our food away and left. I think the only good thing I can say about this place is if you are vegetarian you have more choices here.  and it was EXPENSIVE $13 ...."}
{"text":"The pocket wrap sandwiches are horrible. They're egg sandwiches that claim to be grilled but the fillings were cold, almost frozen. They were also not wrapped properly and tiny. For almost $7 I'd expect something triple the size. The meager filings were leaking and dripping onto the table. I doubt there was even half an egg in this.  This resembled a pizza pocket u get in the grocery store for a dollar.   This place only gets two stars because their$8 soup is warm and flavorful. Stay away from this overpriced food stand."}
{"text":"I bought salad this noon. The service is far from professional or polite. The salad has very small amount. Compared to other restaurants that has salad at similar price, the amount is too small and the food is not exceptional. I will not go to this place next time."}
{"text":"Freshii can be a great, healthy lunch option, but there are some rules I've learned when it comes to ordering:  1) Custom order everything or it will be full of random sauces, rice and noodles.  2) Order a salad -They have a huge selection of toppings and you can pick what you like on the little sheet. I usually tick off a lot of the free toppings, and choose one or two extras. It's about $1.50 for each addition add-on of tofu or chicken, fresh fruit, cheese and nuts, so it can get pricey if you're not careful. A little tip for my vegetarian friends: chick peas, black beans and edamame are free - load up. Salads come with free pita bread.  2) Wraps - Order a wrap if you are really hungry. They are fairly big. Unfortunately, it's mostly full of rice (side note: why would you want rice in your sandwich?)  3) Stir fry - Like the wraps, the stir fry is essentially a container of rice with very few vegetables mixed in. This is disappointing because they have so much potential for a great custom order stir fry, but they're too cheap to make it work.   4) Soup - There are better places for noodle soup in Toronto.  5) Follow them on Twitter -They have some pretty good daily specials that you can mention. For example: \"Free avocado if you mention this tweet!\" Now that doesn't sound very exciting, but in Freshii world avocado costs $1.50.  Overall - A good place if you want a salad, but I'd go elsewhere if you want a sandwich/wrap/stirfry/soup."}
{"text":"Ordered two buffalo wraps and two chicken club wraps for delivery and ended up with four chicken club wraps.  Not very much flavor, wraps were fresh, but there wasn't much filling in the wraps.  Ordered again today, will see if there is any improvement."}
{"text":"Frequently go to this location. Staff needs to learn foodsafe rules.  Girl on cash prepares food, then does cash with her gloves on. Then goes back to preparing food. Gross. She picks up ingredients with her fists. Really? Not exactly right portions. Two boys on staff were ok but clearly need more training. Rice tasted stale. Cabbage brown. Not too impressed.  Visited at 6:30pm Jan 25th."}
{"text":"Like Hale & Hearty in the States but more expensive and less delicious.  They really need to put up a sign telling newcomers where to stand and how to order, otherwise you will end up waiting on an imaginary line where your number comes up...never.  On my first visit, I opted for the freshii designed spinach-tuna salad with almonds, apples, and honey dijon dressing. The spinach was so metallic tasting and the tuna so bland, I \"tossed\" it (in the bin) after a few bites.  I went back weeks later to custom create my own salad, spending $11 to compose the salade par excellence. It was only when I took my ingenious creation home that I realized the salad maker forgot to add the protein that I was charged an extra $4 for.   Blech ingredients + incompetent service = Not impressed.  Lettuce hope they improve."}
{"text":"Walking past , the idea of burrito / salad wrap enticed me into Freshii.    Late afternoon, the shop wasn't crowded.   I ordered at the counter speaking to the server.  The clipboard/checkbox thing may be efficient for busy lunchers, but I've little inclination to work that much for a snack.    I had a cobb wrap and picked up a couple of gluten-free muffin/cupcake things from the little bakery kiosk embedded in the wall.     I found the decor witty in a slightly-overwrought corporate way.  (The periodic table of ingredients appealed to me.  What can I say?  I'm a nerd.)    The place was impeccably clean and the service was fast and accurate.    My wrap was very good with fresh ingredients.  It tasted as I imagined it would.   I did ask for more dressing for dipping.  I had it instantly with a smile and no extra charge.    The mini-muffins were interesting.  The passion-fruit flavor was tasty but I found their texture overly dense and grainy.  I'm glad I tried them, but probably wouldn't try more.    Overall, I was happy with Freshii.    Clean, efficient, fresh & tasty, all at a good price."}
{"text":"Great options but again for the ingredients one gets, its too expensive and overpriced. Serving healthy food and vegetables should not be this complicated and expensive. The bowls and wraps are of good quality but some of the sauces totally detracts from the healthy side of the choice made."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall space-wise keeps it at three stars but ingredients are top notch.  Great place to stop for healthy (or healthy aspiring) people.  Service could be faster but I wouldn't want them to give up on the quality to move people through more quickly."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I have been to Freshii before, so maybe it was this specific location. Ordered their buddha satay- noodles, veggies and crispy wontons. Asked the server for it to be spicy- i got a bowl of noddles, 1/2 the vegtables, no wontons and and so mush siracha i couldnt taste anything else.   Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot a couple years ago and it was pretty good. But I ate there recently and wasn't super impressed - everything was kind of flavorless and lacked in the veggie vs. noodle ratio. I'd probably eat there again only because there aren't that many fast healthy options, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been to many Freshii locations and this one is just about the same as all the rest. However, they don't tend to pack it in as much as other locations. But otherwise, it's alright."}
{"text":"if you're vegan, i wouldn't go here. not only is it a rip-off, but not getting what you ordered is a very real possibility. we explicitly told them to make everything vegan and we ordered our wraps with tofu. that is, we had the casher verify that every item we ordered was vegan with this nutritional info sheet. our first impression was that the cashier was really nice for checking and it seemed like she cared about dietary restrictions, and we even tipped. however, one of the wraps ended up having tuna, and when we told them, they said something along the lines of \"well the order said tuna.\" they did apologize eventually, but honestly, it wasn't enough, and we won't be going back  also the food didn't even taste good. we paid $30 for 2 wraps and a bowl. the tofu is raw. sorry, but if i get tofu somewhere, i want it cooked. you wouldn't serve uncooked meat. raw tofu has no flavor. do they even test the vegan food they make? it's not like vegans have an entirely different set of tastebuds. if it doesn't taste good to you, we probably wouldn't like it either. from now on i'm sticking to chipotle and noodles & co for vegan fast food, where they actually cook and season their tofu and don't mess up an explicitly vegan order. if i pay $30 for vegan wraps, the last thing i want is a mouthful of tuna. and if i do get a mouthful of tuna, i'd be willing to forgive you if you don't initially blame the customer for your mistake. and offering a refund would be nice, as this is in my opinion, the least you can do.   in conclusion, if you're vegan, don't go here. go to a restaurant that actually tastes their vegan food and doesn't just chop up a block of tofu and call it a day"}
{"text":"I love this chain, but this location needs to re-train their staff. Having conversations while making customers wait to place an order is poor customer service. Not knowing how to make the menu items indicates to customers that the staff have not been properly trained. Get it together, you're giving a good chain a bad name."}
{"text":"I love this place for all of the healty options on the menu.  It is as good as fast food gets. All of the disposable containers used for food are biodegradable.  This contributes to the green philosohphy of the restaurant, The tart FroYo is a treat.  It contains probiotic yogurt and tastes great.  You're allowed to choose two toppings.  I come to this place often."}
{"text":"I like the mission statement as stated on there website.  I believe and follow similar practices.  For a business that strives for healthy food, consider taking iceberg lettuce off your over all salads and sodas as a beverage option.  Observed service style of Starbucks, rushing people to hurry up and order.  Observed managers people skills.  Was not positive, especially with employees.  Manager lacked the skill to have positive attitude.  I'm aware it's still a new business here in Madison WI.    For this reason I gave it one star.  Will not be coming back and recommend others to stay away."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients! Great variety of different cuisines! Loved the frozen kefir with mango, almonds and honey! A must try!"}
{"text":"The Oaxaca with tofu is my favorite - delicious and filling! I just wish it was a little cheaper..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a dozen or so times and now feel ready to voice an opinion. I agree with the reviewer who reported that the ordering process can be a bit confusing - it's true. It's not immediately obvious that you need to grab a clipboard, get in line, choose a wrap/salad/bowl from the menu, write it down on the order form, and then hand it in. But now that I've told you, you should be fine.   Price is consistent with most things in the area, (about 9$ after tax for a noodle bowl/wrap/salad), which is to say that it's a bit pricey for what you get. The service is assembly line efficient, but that doesn't always mean fast. Today I rolled in at 12:10, along with everyone else who works in the area. Stood in line for 10 minutes, waited another 5 for my food, and then escaped.   It can be a bit bland - I now ask for extra sauce as well as hot sauce to get some flavour in whatever I order. But it's a much healthier option than the greasy Asian noodles in the college park food court - I can recognize actual vegetables in my noodle bowl. Some staff are friendly, some a bit more surly, but no one has been outright rude. If you forget to pack your lunch and you're in the area, it's worth a try, but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"I found a hair in my rice bowl and an onion peel... The foods good but the service sucks and it's not that clean inside .... Other locations are much better."}
{"text":"Poor Service!!  I picked avocado for the \"creat your own salad\" and they forgot to add it! I even asked \"did you put avocado in my salad? \" and she said Yes. And after I finished eating, i still can't find my avocado! This is not the first time it happens! TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, I love a good healthy restaurant. My husband got a burrito, and despite the \"grill\" marks, the meat was cold and the cheese unmelted. An added bonus was a string of plastic that looked like a hair.  I had the Buddha bowl with falafel. The sauce, quinoa, and falafel were tasty and warm, but they just threw a bunch of ice cold veggies on top. I'd prefer my food to all be one temperature.  For what it cost ($20), we're not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I have had the burrito, I think it is the Tex-Mex. I asked for hot sauce on the side and they gave me a drop...literally. I asked for them to fill up a small cup of it (their cups are like the size of half of a shot glass, but the woman serving me acted like it was a real chore for her! I do find the service here VERY unfriendly. No smile when a customer walks up to the counter, no \"hello\" offered, even though I always greet them. They just stare. i do think management needs to ensure that his staff is friendly. These are among the worst."}
{"text":"After a long hike we were feeling energized and hungry so Freshii seemed like the ideal place to go for some healthy food.   Ordered a green energy juice and a burrito.   The juice was just like how I make jt at home and was energizing.  The burrito was good but lacked flavour.  There was siracha sauce on the table which saved the day.  The sign on the door says it's closed Sunday's but it was open.  Not sure what happened there."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast lines and friendly service. I've visited twice now and had a pangoa bowl w shrimp and a Asian veggie soup also with shrimp. The only difference a size to the soup easier was expecting something more pho-like by the description. It was good and I think the veggies could've been cooked a bit longer, I was just expecting a traditional broth and it was more on the mild american chicken broth. my friend regularly (and by regular i mean almost every other day!)  gets the Thai lemongrass burrito with tofu.  Reasonably priced, fresh and fast."}
{"text":"It's definitely healthy and I love that there are more healthy alternatives in Calgary now. But the salad I got from here was far too plain and I'm not asking for dressing or anything, but in terms of even natural flavour, it didn't really exist. I hear the bowls here are good but I'm hesitant on trying that out since I've also heard mixed reviews (especially for what you pay)."}
{"text":"so i went in tonget my freshii smoothie and was greeted pleasantly by the manager of the store. literally less than two minutes after, i got a dirty look from this employee when i asked for an extra bowl for my mother.   this rude employee continued to give us dirty looks dring our entire visit. especially when i asked for a straw. like, yes, my food was fine, but service is awful. the employees are awfully rude and barely any of them smile.  go for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a healthy meal. The staff here work hard to provide quick and friendly service. They made an error with my order but were quick to rectify this. I added an order of Energii (energy) bites to my meal for a nice treat after the meal. A quick note about these morsels of oats, peanut butter, chocolate chips and coconut: one order consists of 2 energii bites. Sometimes it's confusing for customers when they want two but say 'two orders'.   It is a bit pricier with the more you add on. A base generally includes brown rice and veggies but adding a protein or kale/quinoa as a base adds to the cost (about $2).   You can generally expect to spend $12-20 depending on what you add to your order. The drinks cost a lot.  The best thing about Freshii is how customizable it is. You can grab a clipboard and create your own dish! There are plenty of options for vegans and any dietary restriction!   Seating is limited as it's quite a narrow restaurant!   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I've been hoping for a healthy fast food restaurant. The trend is getting there and Freshii is the next step. Salads, burritos, wraps and bowls made with a whole host of whole food options: artichoke hearts, kale, quinoa, avocado, etc. If you don't know what some of these are, don't be scared off. The taste is great! And your body will love you for it. I haven't see a nutritional info list, so I'd steer clear of dressings and sauces that could be packed with fat and sugar.  I found out that there are 208 Freshii's worldwide, so they're doing something right. This is the first one in Wisconsin. Let's give them a warm welcome and do our bodies a favor at the same time!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place to grab a quick and relatively healthy lunch/dinner. Nothing fancy.  Love their smoothies.  Noodle & rice bowls are OK for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I ordered a protein salad and the majority of salad was spinach and barely any toppings. It was disappointing given the salads are not cheap. I agree with another reviewer with the large wall in front of counter it is like they are trying to hide something. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've walked by the various locations of Freshii many times and finally went to try it yesterday for lunch. I was STARVING and thought a cobb salad with chicken (almost $13 taxes in) would be a sufficient lunch.  I was so wrong. The portion size looks okay, but it's mostly lettuce and was pretty sparse on the toppings. Hardly any avocado to be found and very few chicken pieces. I have paid less than $10 for a much better salad at Druxys where the toppings are unlimited and they don't skimp on anything. Yes, the lettuce was fresh, but it was not better than other salad bars. I wouldn't recommend this place, as it's not worth what you pay.  I was left unsatisfied and still really hungry. I felt like I'd had an appetizer not a lunch."}
{"text":"For fresh, bright, healthy food, this is the place to go. I got a zen wrap and my mom got a TeX Mex burrito. Chicken in the zen wrap and steak in the buritto. We swapped halves and got a taste of each. The zen wrap was delicioisly fresh, makes you feel good with each bite you take. The TeX Mex buritto was good but basic, something I could easily make at home without a lot of ingredient's. I'm not a fan of chain resturants , but Freshii offers something that you don't find often. I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a bowl with goat cheese, and freshii was the only place in the area that had it. This was my second time here, the first was not a pleasant experience but i thought i'd try again.  Ordered the metaboost salad, with quinoa (+.75 charge) and chicken (2.29). The extra charges are always a pain, and especially when they forget to add them. In this case, i also added extra 'sauce' (spicy yogurt .50 charge). I realized when i got back to the office they didn't add it. It wasn't busy and the cashier did communicate it to the kitchen.  The 2 stars isn't about the .50 lost, but how it isn't the first time. A colleague ordered a bowl a few weeks ago and they forgot to add in the chicken she requested (2.29 charge!!). I could only imagine how much they make off the extra charges and the saved food/sauces.  If you're wondering what happened the 1st time, i ordered one of the quinoa wraps. At least 3/4 of the wrap was quinoa - bland and dry!"}
{"text":"The only reason I've been eating here for the past few weeks is because I'm on a very strict diet.  Pretty pricey for what you get.   Ingredients range from pretty decent to kinda gross, with one major exception:  DO NOT GET THE STEAK, FOR ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY IN THIS WORLD. It is just a homogenized steak-goop that was reformed into something vaguely resembling a steak and grilled. And then frozen. And then partially thawed out  Service is fast, so even if they aren't particularly happy, you'll at least be done with them quickly so you can rush home to eat your depression-inducing steak and rice bowl."}
{"text":"Really hungry and wanting something healthy I decided to give this place a second try. First of all, they were out of brown rice to that tossed my initial menu plans out the window. I settle with the Turkey Cobb Wrap, which while bland without hot sauce, I figured would at least be better for me than the Pizzaiola \"Godfather\" slice that had been calling my name.  Wrong.  I got back to my desk and decided to look up the nutriontional value of this \"healthy alternative\". Because nowhere on their site do they list the premade menu items, I had to select each item on their menu generator to learn what I was eating. The result:  Calories    : 819 Total Fat  : 43.41 Saturated Fat  :10.97 Cholesterol  : 267mg Sodium  : 1661mg Total Carbohydrate : 61mg   Dietary Fiber  :9.14mg Protein  46mg (this seems impossibly high).  I know this is my own fault for ordering it but I really thought that anything I ordered from there would be a healthy lunch alternative to pizza or burgers.   I know I should have been prepared and brought a lunch, but I didnt. I feel angry and mislead that a company that bills itself as a healthy eatery could have something so dastardly as one of their \"chef designed\" menu items.  Never eating there again."}
{"text":"The lady working here was plain rude and they are insanely overpriced. Do not eat here. This smoothie cost me $8 CAD and I finished it in four sips"}
{"text":"This place is not worth your money. Menu items are over priced, especially considering that adding protein to your item costs another $2 or more. To sum this place up, imagine a less efficient Chipotle with incompetent student workers, NOT fresh ingredients, slow service, and what seems to be no training from management. I could strap on an apron and gloves and make my own meal faster than the employees here. If you have any food allergies, definitely do NOT come here to eat, as requesting any ingredient to be excluded from your meal will simply go ignored. I might note that this is my third negative experience here. The allure of the location outside the MU is very nice and seating options are plentiful, but I rather go hungry than to give this place a 4th chance to prove me wrong."}
{"text":"Two of us when for early lunch and ordered coffee and burritos.  The coffee was so week you could see the bottom of the cup. Dishwater.  The burritos were half cooked. All the beans (and there was a lot lot of them) were all at one end and cold in sections. No sure how you do that. They did offer a 10 per cent off on our next visit. We asked why we would want that  because we weren't going back and we didn't eat the food we had. Small tin chairs and tables. Just a cold setting and small menu."}
{"text":"Always seem to be disappointed by the food and service at Freshii. The staff here were terse and seemed unhappy that they had to process our food. If that was the case, it certainly showed in the taste and presentation - very bland and mushy.. Expensive for the poor quality that they produce. At least the space is cute, but the table was dirty. Just all around, not somewhere I'd ever recommend someone trying. Too bad."}
{"text":"Had the Buddha noodle bowl with steak the other day, the steak was so chewy I ended up picking them all out and throw away. Peanut sauce was plain, nothing special. Definitely not worth the $12 price tag.   The noodle bowl reminds me of Basil Box. They offer much better quality steak with more reasonable pricing, and better flavour that's bold yet approachable"}
{"text":"As an enthusiastic eater who frequently dines out, I can tell you that throwing caution to the wind catches up with you. And while I don't consider Taco Tuesdays, Friday Fish Frys, gourmet burgers, and decadent brunches evil, my health can't pay the bills on the upkeep with making these things a regular part of my lifestyle. What does that have to do with this review?  Freshii is awesome because everything is delicious despite being relatively simple and exceptionally healthy. My favorites are the Sushito, Spicy Thai, and the Fiesta, and my wife loves the Market wrap. You can get any of their menu items on a whole wheat wrap or a green wrap, which is made out of kale. Meat (all hormone-free) is an optional add-on, but the food is flavorful enough to easily stand on its own without it.  For drinks, highlights include coconut water, Mexican Coca Cola (real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup), and fresh juices made to order. If you have room, the kefir frozen yogurt is delicious, and they use that same stuff in many of their yummy smoothies.  The owner, Jack, is an extremely nice guy who cares a lot about the customer experience. We love this place and heartily recommend it, so give it a shot. Both your taste buds and your waistline will thank you!"}
{"text":"Never had an order correctly made and they don't really care about that either. Badly run joint. Not even worth the one star."}
{"text":"I've been to Freshii a few times for the bowls and wraps...And while I do enjoy the food, it is not very consistent. At this point, I do prefer the bowls over the burrito/wraps.  Ingredients seem very fresh and a good variety to build your own salad, bowl or wrap.  Service is very quick and staff is helpful.  Freshii will not be my \"go to\" spot but will return from time to time."}
{"text":"salad's are always fresh and delicious.  Price is very resonable since you get alot of unlimited topping choices.  Parkking can be difficult depending of time of day."}
{"text":"Awesome place if you want to grab some healthy food to go. Staff members are extremely helpful and friendly. Unfortunately It's under very poor management. I am a regular as I live in the neighbourhood and I have never seen the manager work. It's extremely uncomfortable to watch the staff work hard and then to see the manager in the corner sitting on his laptop 24/7. What's even worst is I recently went to grab some dinner and the manager was literally sleeping on the bench with a pillow and everything! Not cool dude"}
{"text":"WTF did I just pay $12 for?  Let's start with the location. Deerfoot City. New, so not busy. Clean. Very nice looking.  I walked in around 6pm Saturday night. No other customers, so service was fast, but that's about it.  The menu looked good, but I only wanted something \"freshii\" to wash down my yummy Smashburger. I highly recommend the BBQ Bacon Cheese BTW  I decided on the Green Energy. I asked the only employee for two (one for me and a surprise one for my wife). She rung me up and almost walked away, when I asked her for my receipt. I got it and then looked around for the juicer to watch her make the drinks. Little did I know, that at \"Freshii\", the drinks are not made fresh.  She stared back at me and said \"You can get them behind you.\"  I spun around and saw a fridge stocked with several drinks of various recipes in take away cups. I asked, \"Oh, they are pre-made, not fresh?\"  she replied \"Yes.\"  Looking back now, I should have changed my mind and got a refund. I have no idea how long they have been sitting there or what is actually in them. The drink had settled out and the liquid was brown, not even slightly green as I would expect them to be. It didn't even taste good. It tasted like it had been there way too long. Not freshii at all!  I can only hope that other locations are better, but I will never find out, because I will not be going to any others.  My advice, go to Jugo Juice instead. It's a Calgary company, they cost about the same amount and they actually juice the veggies and fruit right in front of you as you order. You can taste the difference."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found ourselves in the area with her craving Mexican and me craving some kind of Asian. We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon at kind of an odd time and got two of the bottled drinks, a tex-mex burrito with double steak, and a Buddha bowl (rice noodles, vegetables, \"spicy peanut sauce,\" fried wontons).  The burrito my girlfriend rated as a 5, with a perfectly customized Chipotle burrito at a 9 or 10. Towards the end of the burrito, though, she said she didn't love the taste of the meat and that she thought the vegetarian option might have been better. That's the first time in 7 years I've ever heard my favorite meatitarian even express interest in a vegetarian option at a restaurant. Also, as someone from Texas, she said the Tex-Mex aspect of the burrito was \"dreadful.\"  My Buddha bowl was just an unforgivably bad idea. It's cooked plain rice noodles, some exceptionally unflavorful sauce (I asked for double, and ended up with just barely enough), and vegetables. Almost a third of the bowl was tasteless steamed broccoli, with some raw carrots and red cabbage mixed in with the noodles. The ingredients were not cooked together at all, so no flavor there, and were extremely tasteless. The best part of the whole bowl was the wontons. I physically could not believe how little flavor it had.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice enough, I guess. My girlfriend described it as \"a modernist yuppie who likes to go to anti-GMO rallies,\" which is pretty accurate IMO. All of the tables have a pamphlet on them advertising the juice cleansing program the chain sells, which costs between $30 and $130, requires you to pick up juices from them every morning, and looks like a good way to do yourself absolutely 0 good. It lent the place a kind of predatory, commercial air.  Altogether, the best part of the meal was the bottled drinks. Would not return."}
{"text":"I've been to a few nice Freshii locations (by Rosedale station and Eglinton station) so I went into this one. Horrible idea. The restaurant was dirty and run down and the food hidden behind a big wall so you can't see what they're doing. I also got half the food that I got in the other restaurants for the same bowl... For the same ridiculous price of course. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh. The new additions add good variety to the menu. And I fell in love with the new energii bites. It's tastes as good as cookie dough, but it good for you.  They're amazing. you have to try them!"}
{"text":"It's not fair to compare the price of this place to neighbouring fast food joints--they serve REAL food here, not \"food-like substances\" you'd get at Wendy's. I tried this at a time when I wasn't a big fan of veggies and the delicious salad I custom made lead to a gradual shift towards the greens. Today I owe my love of healthy, fresh and real food to freshii.   The staff and owner are very friendly and customer service oriented.   I love this place."}
{"text":"I am SO TORN  I actually like Freshii. I like the Salad's, I like the fact that the Chicken is raised without anti-biotics and such (I contacted head office and asked) and I like their burritos when I am cheating with wheat. I also like the bio-degradable bags, the enviro-conscious bit.. everything, but I have recently become.. aggravated with Freshii.   Here is the deal. Freshii has a loyalty card program. You collect stamps (8 or so) and you get a free salad. Everyone is used to the loyalty card system these days, right? December, I am particularly busy and not finding the time to prepare my lunch as often. Freshii is right beside my office, and they offer healthy and quick lunches, although not cheaply. A customized salad is basically $12. I get it. But I am also somewhat relieved that after 8 of these puppies I get one for free.   I pick up a non-descript loyalty card, and begin stamping away during December. I happily make my way through right before the holidays and decide to save my salad for the first day back in the office. I visit January 3rd and am told that I had to redeem my free salad in DECEMBER and that my card is not valid. Absolutely NO WHERE on the card, menu, box the cards sit in, ANYWHERE is any messaging regarding the \"same month\" rule. Not even a \"December\" on the card itself. I very begrudgingly purchased my salad and left. Honestly I have yet to return. I then contacted head office again and go not response. TIGHT.  Its the little things. I was eating here twice a week before, now .. Im ticked."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since it opened.  I finally ordered a Cobb Salad to go today, without the blue cheese.  I  should have asked for the dressing on the side, but it wasn't offered.  The salad is a bit of a mushy mess.  The bacon is quite awful (I LOVE bacon).  There are huge chunks of gristly meat that are just gross, and the bacon tastes like it was run through a burning building - far too smokey.  I know there's avocado in there somewhere, but it seems to have disintegrated somehow.   I was also the only customer at the height of lunch hour.  Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here once and it was to have some of their frozen yogurt. The texture of it was pretty creamy, which I loved. The only flavour they have is regular tart, which was perfect for me since that's all I ever get when I buy froyo.  They had a variety of toppings, some healthy and some not so healthy. I went for Oreo crumbs and chocolate chips. It was very yummy! Reasonably priced as well, at least compared to the popular frozen yogurt chains around town."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really like Freshii as a chain but this location is bad! Firstly I find it disconcerting that I can't see the ingredients/prep area. This location has a 5 1/2 foot high wall all the way along where the counter might normally be which I think is just strange. It gives me the impression that they are trying to hide something. Also, you can barely see if the staff are there. Secondly, and more importantly the staff that have served me here on a few occasions are really rude.   I would be a regular at this location if the above wasn't the case because the food is consistent with freshii's high standards but the unfriendly staff just wind me up."}
{"text":"I come here every morning for their oatmeal. It's tasty, fresh and keeps me full for the day! Every time I come in, the team says good morning and smiles.   I also love the Freshii Green smoothie for an afternoon snack... the avocoado and pineapple are awesome together."}
{"text":"Consistently the worst lunch-time service in downtown Charlotte. I've been there a dozen times, all of my visits involve me waiting for them to remake my order. Not liking edamame, I always order my meal without it.  They, without fail, always add it to my order. The person remaking my food today was so upset they threw the order at me after putting it in the bag.  Fortunately there are a dozen other lunch spots to choose from in a 50 foot radius of that freshii.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"After hearing my friends raving about this place I finally decided to give it a try! I tried one of their green energy juice thing and the taste was actually pretty great, the seatings are nice and cosy! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"My first time in wisconsin (on a business trip), I'm looking for a vegetarian place on grubhub and found this. Grubhub said it will take 60-70 minutes to deliver AND my email confimation stated that my order will arrive 5:55 - 6:05. I ordered it before i get to the hotel thinking that I wouldn't have to wait too long for it.  Come 5:22 (WHILE I'M IN A MEETING), i get multiple calls saying my order is at the hotel and they sounded pissed that I'm not there yet and that I wasn't answering my phone initially. Too much disappointing and offensive stuff happened during the interaction but I eventually got to the hotel and got my food. The driver has the guts to tell me to give him more tip even though I already included tip in my online payment.  But what the hell, I'm hungry.  I got the Pangoa Bowl and it is DELICIOUS. Mostly because of the sauce. They call it \"hot sauce\" on the menu, but it's more of a mildy spicy BBQ sauce. It was great though. Smoky and tangy, but not too much. It blended really well with the corn, rice, beans, shredded cheese and grape tomatoes in the bowl. I wouldn't mind ordering that again. Although I won't trust their delivery time info anymore"}
{"text":"I tried this place today.  I wanted something warm and satisfying but that is not what I got.  I ordered the Buddha satay bowl with chicken.  The only thing warm were the rice noodles.  All the vegetables and add-ins were diced uncooked vegetables.  It tasted ok but wasn't satisfying.  It might have been good as picnic food on a hot summer day, but not on this cold wintery day.  Also, the drinks in the open cooler were only slightly chilled.  There was also something rather sanitized, cold, detached and barren about the place, not that comfortable for dine-in.Very disappointed, will not likely make a return visit.  I give the place 5-6 months before another roll-over. My rating is actually 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been eating a Freshii for years now and I'm happy to see one in the neighbourhood. Great service with delicious food. The staff was very friendly and efficient, I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Freshii this morning and loved the environment (back quiet area to relax, coffee bar, clean).  Very friendly and helpful staff as well! Glad to see this addition on Grant street - gives healthier options close by."}
{"text":"It's really a shame because this place has the makings for a good healthy option, as you can do a quinoia bowl and add a protien to make it more filling. However, the ingredients are not at all fresh. It's disgusting."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, always on the hunt for healthy food..they were out of kale., it wasn't even noon!  All employees were walking around wearing shirts extolling the virtues of kale.,and there wasn't any!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the delicious and healthy options Freshii has brought to Madison...just need one downtown now!"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday, so my husband and two children and I met at Freshii at Sunpark Plaza. It was our first time at Freshii. It was great!   The owner chatted with us and brought us several samples as we were having difficult choosing from their extensive menu. Finally we chose and all of us were happy with our choices. We ordered a Fiesta Wrap, Buddha Satay Bowl, Pangoa Bowl and Bamboo Bowl. All were delicious. The food was terrific, the atmosphere clean and fresh and the service was wonderful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We will definitely go again and suggest you try it too."}
{"text":"Freshii is a great option if you work next door and want something reasonably healthy. Otherwise, this spot is nothing to travel for.   I've had their frozen yogurt - adequate; the lemongrass soup - lacks flavour; a custom burrito - safest, tastiest bet; green juice - worth it, you can see exactly whats going into it.  This is a better, cheaper option than Camros on Hayden - I think that place has gone quite downhill on the flavours and is so expensive."}
{"text":"Great food and the prices are fair for many of  the choices. Great variety of options and all look very healthy! Definitely recommended if you are looking for something quick and delicious.   The only downside was the customer service wasn't completely top notch, but they are never rude or anything like that.     Love the noodle bowls."}
{"text":"This Freshii is a dismal failure for a healthy food option. I would rather go next door to Wendy's or Mr. Greek and get one of their take out salads that is ready to go and actually has fresh lettuce in it!  I like that you can order the meal in advance online, but guess what? It's not actually ready when you arrive.   I have always gotten salads here because I am looking for a healthy food option, otherwise I would just go to one of the dozens of other fast food or takeout restaurants in the area and get a sandwich or something. However, despite high hopes for improvement over my past few visits, today I am finally giving up. If you are a restaurant that is named for fresh food, I think maybe you should stick to that and get some fresh ingredients in your salads. For a $10.99 price I think that can be managed.  We need a new healthy option in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Freshii - not!  At least not at this location.  I ordered the Mediterranean bowl and got some overcooked, probably reheated rice and limp salad.  The service was even worse than the food.  The older man behind the counter who seems to be the owner is very rude.  In my short time there I heard him screaming at one of his staff a tiny young girl.  I felt so sorry for her and very uncomfortable.  Couldn't wait to get out of there.  YUCK"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Nice to have healthier options at the airport. However, the staff are simply brutal. The service is one of the poorest I have ever seen. The manager on the other hand, whom I have met once months ago, is one of the nicest man."}
{"text":"Delicious quick  breakfast. I had the egg, mushroom, spinach, goat cheese grilled pocket. The food is fresh, tasty, and the staff is pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Wanted to have something healthy, then I stopped here. I had a rice bowl with teriyaki tofu. There is no other sauce except on tofu, so after I finished that small amount of tofu, I only had vegetables, beans on rice.  I saw some hot sauce on table, so I added a little bit. OMG! Then my bowl became so spicy, that I even can't finish it."}
{"text":"Great food but prices were okay I guess. Their smoothies and green juice were over priced for the amount you get. And they messed up on my order and looked at me like it was my fault. Maybe they should do a better job at training the cashier???...."}
{"text":"Healthy yet satisfying options! Between salads, warm rice bowls, and burritos/wraps, Freshii has a solid assortment of items and flavor profiles that bring me back multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I really like Freshii. I eat at the location on Yonge near Roselawn often. I saw this location on King one day and decided to pop in for lunch. My first clue really should have been the strange layout. They have a giant wall and you can't see the food prep. That makes me a tad nervous. I ordered the Pangoa bowl, which I have had many times at other locations - usually it is full of a medly of ingredients. This one was about 90% rice. That's right. A $9 bowl of rice. It seems the lack of vegetables is a constant in these reviews - clearly the owners of this particular location are trying to save a bit of money... Never again. I'd rather eat dirt."}
{"text":"get a bowl, salad, soup, or wrap, any way youd like. thai peanut?  they got it.  teriyaki? yup.  tex m3x bowl?  si amigo. fresh food, and such a variety of options its hard not to create an abominatuon.  reign it in, and enjoy."}
{"text":"So I used to love this place, until I noticed their unsanitary practices. The past two times I've been there, the cashier guy has handled my money and then went straight to putting on gloves.  They are supposed to wash their hands after handling money.  I won't eat at a place that has people working the register and handling food."}
{"text":"This location is the best by far.  I've travel all over Canada for work and this location is my number 1. The food just tastes better here, consistently great. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"After passing this place multiple times a day every day, finally swung in for lunch!  I came around 1 and there wasn't a line at all. However, around 12, there is usually a line out the door.  Ordered the Pangoa bowl. It was a nice size portion with brown rice, corn, black beans, tomatoes, cheese, avocado and a spicy bbq sauce on it. Super filling and very delicious! That sauce was very spicy though....may switch up the sauce to something different next time.   The lunch was quickly prepared and came to about $8 or so. This will be a definite spot in the future for a heathly and filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Interesting food menu. It took me a while to decide what to get cause I don't usually eat at freshii but I enjoyed my salad. I was surprised at how big it was so the price was just right and the ingredients were fresh as well. All in all, i'm happy with what I got."}
{"text":"Slightly lacking in creative flair and legumes. For starters why is there only tofu, black beans and edamame to choose from? How about tempeh? Chickpeas? Lentils? Fava beans? Please bring in more healthy options."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy vegan, vegetarian and non vegetarian eats.  I've had the teryaki twist and the Pangoa bowls both made vegan.  I actually really like the sauces they use in the bowls but the rest is pretty unexciting, good but definitely something I could make at home. They have a variety if soups, wraps, and salads as well. The sauce on the Pangoa is a sweet BBQ and really elevated the whole dish which looks like nothing special until the flavourful sauce hits your taste buds.  If it wasn't for the delicious sauces on the bowls I would be going elsewhere... They are really that good.  They use biodegradable containers (minus the plastic lid) which is great.  The prices are decent and They have a daily $5 meal special which makes me want to eat here regularly.    My only complaint is the bowls are a little boring in terms of visual appear and they are a little skimpy on the toppings. Lots of rice but little of everything else. Also, I find their website extremely annoying to navigate and find contact numbers.  I also wish they were open a little later.   I'll definitely be back."}

{"text":"Fast, friendly, fresh.  This location is well managed and has consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cobb salad. Was definitely tasty but with a juice came up to 20$. Bit pricey for take away salad and juice don't you think? But tasty to say the least."}
{"text":"Freshii is a really great concept. Healthy food that is fresh and tastes good - they even use meat that is hormone-free. I like that Freshii has really fresh food and a lot of it tastes pretty good but every time I get food from here I'm a bit disappointed by how much items cost and how much I get for that price. I feel like food is a bit pricier than it should be. I've eaten at many places and chain food places as well and that is always my thought after I eat at Freshii - I don't feel like it's good value. That being said I know a lot of people like getting food from here so I guess it depends on personal preference."}
{"text":"This place works for me - relatively fast, cheap, healthy food.  Not a lover of chain anything, there are times when we are all faced with Sophies Choice of lunch; Chain Restaurant or Wait Until Dinner.  I chose life! Well, at least in the case of Freshii...    Fantastic spot for CCFs (culinary control freaks) who like to micro-manage the ingredients and prep specs of everything that passes through their lips. My personal strategy for success here is to go salad or bowl - the wrap adds little food value/flavour IMHO - and I have found it better to leave out the protein.    The Bliss bowl actually includes double avocado and a smidge of goat cheese resulting in a super creamy take on a quasi-Asian brown rice bowl.  Had it once by accident and must say that I've become quite a fan.    When you've got to go chain, go here.  You'll definitely feel better about your decision in the short and long term."}
{"text":"Tired of burgers?  This is fairly fast food that tastes fresh and seems like a healthy alternative when craving something for the belly.  Try their green shake - whatever is in that tastes absolutely amazing.  I could drink one of those every day!"}
{"text":"Just got a blueberry crumble oatmeal (since they actually open at 7am) and it was sooo good! Exactly what I was looking for, cooked (not hot water added mix) lots of fresh blueberries and walnuts, yum. Service was super friendly and ++ bonus points for Crema coffee shop inside as well. Great affordablity for the high quality."}
{"text":"The food was okay but I just think its super unfortunate they don't serve food out of proper glassware. having take out containers is fine for when you take out but when you're eating in the restaurant, they should NOT be serving food in disposables.  the fact that their containers are made of corn isn't good enough.  most containers will never be composted.  provide real cutlery and glassware and wash the damn the dishes to lighten your impact on the environment."}
{"text":"Good healthy burrito's and salads. The soup is quite awful. They pour hot broth over uncooked vegetables in a tall plastic container. Food isn't healthy if you don't eat it :). The burritos are great though. Service is a bit slow but it's because they prepare everything in front of you. And yes there are smoothies and they are awesome."}
{"text":"So awesome. When my coworker mentioned that Freshii was open close to our office I was super excited. As a vegetarian, finding options at fast casual restaurants can sometimes be a challenge. Freshii has so many vegetarian options I will have to visit often just to try them all! I had the teriyaki bowl on my first visit. You know that feeling you get when you ate something good for you? You feel lighter and ready to take on the rest of the day. Well that's what thee teriyaki did for me. Tons of veggies, plus I topped it with falafel. My falafel cravings thank them for offering it as a topper to any dish. Yum. Om this visit I devoured a smokehouse burrito. I know you're thinking \"that doesn't sound vegetarian\". Well I LOVE bbq sauce and this veggie friendly burrito has me hooked! Can't wait to try more things. Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Let me say that this particular location should not turn you off Freshii as a chain. It can be pretty good. But this one... it's like they hate vegetables. No matter what I order, I have to specify extra veg just to get something that resembles a normal bowl elsewhere. You could probably pile up all the vegetables in a single tablespoon. The same goes for the sauce. The rest is just a mass of bland, stuck together noodles or warmed over brown rice. Terrible. You are better off going to IQ Foods if you want this sort of food. Or Kupfert & Kim's. Worst. Freshii. Ever."}
{"text":"Freshii is not cheap. But the food is both healthy and tasty. I can't get enough of their Asian vegetable soup (a delicious broth with rice-noodles, grilled tofu, spinach, edamame beans, celery, carrots, and corn). The wraps aren't bad, either. NOTE: when I went to this location last, they weren't accepting debit. I think that's a temporary problem, though."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! You can customize your order if you don't like any of the combinations on the menu. Even without any meat the bowls are super filling. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty. Reasonably priced for such quality food."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but so conveniently located downstairs from my office!   I always get the rice noodle soup. The portions are quite generous, but beware of the spicy lemon grass soup - It's really spicy! The veggies are always fresh, and I love coming here for a healthy alternative.   Tip: Ask the cashier for a stamp card - they don't always offer it to you. I didn't find out about the stamp card till my coworker told me she has enough stamps for a free salad."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day because I was between meetings and there didn't seem to be that many quick yet good places around to grab lunch.   First impressions were not good. You walk down a rather large and steep flight of stairs into a basement dungeon where it's unclear whether you pay first and then wait to have your food prepared (as is the case in the Freshii at Bloor and Islington where I usually go) or order your food and then pay. The dude at the cash kept calling out to me but I couldn't hear him because it's crazy loud in that dungeon. I finally got within 6 inches of him and I could finally hear that he wanted me to order first before paying. Okay.  The order girl couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear her. Again, the acoustics are terrible in this dungeon and you're separated from the person making your food by a high shield of glass. Finally we managed to make ourselves understood and I got and paid for my Zen wrap. I'm very disappointed that they seem to have gotten rid of my favourite Spicy Thai Burrito. Very disappointed.  My Zen wrap was not good. First of all, the other reviewers are correct. This place does shove as much lettuce as they can into your wraps at the expense of not having room for other things in the wrap and also at the expense of the integrity of the wrap. My wrap was split down the middle so it was very unpleasant and messy to eat. My wrap also barely contained anything other than the lettuce and spinach. There were a few scant pieces of broccoli, a few shreds of carrot, a couple edamame beans, and a meager amount of mango.   Dressing? If there was any on this wrap, it was the driest, most invisible dressing I've ever come across. That's another thing that the other reviewers are accurate about: they do not want to give you dressing. Why, St. Clair Freshii? Why are you hoarding your dressing? Are you saving it up for the apocalypse? Do you plan on bartering your hoarded dressing for medical supplies and zombie-slaying tools? Sheesh. Be a little more liberal with your dressing, dudes."}
{"text":"Good food and filling. I tried buddah setay, it's spicy good. I added sriracha for more flavor. Deffinately recommended."}
{"text":"pathetic. that's literally the only word that comes to mind.  we placed an order today through JustEat.ca, and i requested no avocado, because i am highly allergic.  the order arrives, and lo and behold my texmex chicken burrito is covered in avocado.  so we call you guys and let you know, and you tell us that there was no request for no avocado.  then later in the conversation you admit \"oh there it is...at  the bottom.\"  you then explain how you're going to have it sent back out.  it's almost an hour after that phone call, and no burrito in site.  i call in, and am told \"well...we called a driver, but they haven't come to get it yet.\"  here's the crazy part.  our office is at bathurst & queen.  you are at king & bathurst.  how goddamn lazy are you?  WALK THE FUCKING ORDER UP THE STREET.  you could say that i could have also walked to the store, but we'd paid for our order to be delivered for our whole office staff.  so here i am.  waiting on a burrito like a fucking moron.  actually....wait.  take your burrito, and shove it up your fucking ass.  what an absolute load of horseshit.  UPDATE: just received my burrito (a miracle?  act of god?) and this is what i imagine reheated dog shit tastes like.  suffice it to say, you will never get my money again."}
{"text":"I tried the spicy Thai burrito from this location for lunch today. The location was busy and I was worried it was going to take a while to get my order, but they are pretty fast and efficient at assembling the various salads, wraps, bowls, and burritos. You order and pay at the counter, tell them your name (somehow I became Lisa, oh well) and they assemble your order and hand it off to you. There were a few tables at this location, but most people seemed to be taking their orders to go.   There is a really good selection of wraps, bowls, salads, soups, and burritos. Most of the components of these items are vegan or vegetarian. You can get animal or non-animal protein added to your order (e.g. chicken, steak, tofu, falafels). The ingredients all look very fresh, colourful, and healthy.  The spicy Thai burrito I ordered came topped with quinoa, cabbage, carrots, edamame, and a spicy Thai sauce. They didn't apply the spicy Thai sauce evenly so the top half of my burrito was completely lacking in sauce and all I tasted was the fresh vegetables and quinoa. It was tasty, insofar as I enjoy fresh vegetables and quinoa, but it didn't blow my mind. When I got to the bottom half of my burrito and I finally tasted the spicy Thai sauce, then I really started to enjoy my meal. That sauce has a nicely balanced spicy kick. I would next time ask for extra sauce and hope that solves the issue of a half unsauced burrito.   The menu items all look good for you and sound delicious, but if you are counting calories, you might want to consult the nutrition information before you order. My burrito was a very reasonable 480 calories, but some of the other options I was considering were well over 800 calories (a couple of the wraps). The soups and salads all seem to be reasonable in calorie count. You also have the option of subbing out any of the base or wrap for a salad base or collard green wrap.   The prices were on par with what you'd pay to get a wrap, salad or burrito at other places. I will definitely come back here again to try a few of the other options."}
{"text":"Got a pangoa bowl and not only was the rice undercooked/stale because it was dry and hard, but the chicken was also bland and dry as well. Considering the quality, it was expensive. I should've just went to chipotle."}
{"text":"I really like this place until I realized I was supposed to have dishes that were advertised as having brown rice which was actually white.  I have cooked brown rice all my life and what they serve and advertise as brown rice is not brown rice.  I still recommend this restaurant for the other dishes but definitely notfor any that are reported to have brown rice."}
{"text":"You know the Seinfeld episode with the non-fat yogurt they all love that's so amazing? That yogurt exists. And this is the place that sells it. F-ing GO.  It's a billion dollars a cup (well, $6.50 for a small cup is so nutso I can't really begin to understand that silliness, but it is a pretty big cup), and man - IT IS CRAZY DELICIOUS. I had one with strawberries and blueberries and each. damn. bite. was intense. And usually halfway through any ice cream/cold food item, I'm all \"Okay, I'm good, I don't need to finish this\" - but you want to finish this and lick the cup, like, in public. I thought it was non-fat ('cause that's what the signs in the place say) but online it says that it's \"low-fat\", so not sure what's up there. Go eat this guy. Crazy good."}
{"text":"There are several locations of freshii located everywhere. I happen to be at the one in eaton centre because I had training at a nearby business building so I decided to get some lunch here. I work in the financial district so the healthy box concept is very common and well done in that area. I decided to be a bit more adventurous with my choice and get a pre designed salad. I got the bacon Texas salad that had Monterey Jack cheese, ranch dressing, tomatoes, avocado, and chicken on top of romaine lettuce. My salad was about $10.00 which is an average lunch price I am used to.  When I received my order I was fairly disappointed at the size. For 10.00 I got a very shallow box of salad. Inside my salad was more disappointing. It basically tasted like a Caesar salad with rand dressing. It had barely any avocado in it and needless to say I was still searching for more to eat once I was done.   I've been to other salad places before and for the price and quantity you are getting you're better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Truly made my day! The owner, Lauri (Lori?), is a wonderful woman, and the cashier was super nice and helped me pick out a soup and a juice that not only suited my tastes, but made me feel energized during my chest cold. Not only can I be super picky, but I'm a vegetarian, and the experience did NOT disappoint. Pleasant employees are just as important as the food being prepped and served, and I will be going back ASAP. If you love wholesome, healthy food, and great customer service this is the place to go! Side note, GET THE DETOX JUICE. It was so delicious and fresh. :D"}
{"text":"just ewww ; /  I had the blandest burrito I have EVER had at this place!  It was packed mainly with brown rice and they skimped out on all the other ingredients.  Never coming to this place again.  The people who like this place must be lacking taste buds or have never had decent food.  This place is all frills and no substance."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner between classes. It is kind of like Chipotle and Qdoba, but the focus is not just Mexican burritos.  Pros: Buffalo sauce is great Interesting menu items Lots of vegetarian options  Cons: Significantly slower than Chipotle / Qdoba Store has a strange smell (Maybe new building, but maybe not)  Note: Menu items don't come with meat, which is ordered as an add-on if you are interested."}
{"text":"Who knew a salad could be so bad? This was one of the poorest and overpriced salad experiences I've ever had. I think my children could've prepared a better salad.   My 'Protein Salad' ($10.50 incl tax) consisted of spinach, a paltry amount of tuna, a pathetic sum of apple and cucumber, and tasted unbelievably boring.   Don't bother with this place when there are so many other great places (eg. Fresh on Spadina) so close by. Argh."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I came back to freshli to eat a burritto because I was hungry and they are conveniently located. It has now been 20 minutes. There are 3 customers and 4 staff. One person is making the food. One person has a sheet of paper and a pen another is organizing chips...the saga continues. Herbie is everywhere..."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible will never return ordered frozen yogurt  sat down to wait for it after 10 minutes went to ask for it. It was siting on counter melting. Staff could not take the time to call out it was ready The name is Freshii this implies fresh food the mango on the yogurt was canned or frozen not fresh. Should be zero stars but min is 1 on app"}
{"text":"A pretty decent tasting premium salad. I keep getting their fiesta salad because it's refreshing and relatively okay at keeping me filled up.  The prep here seems a little inconsistent, like sometimes I get nice even pieces of bite sized avocado and other times it's a giant wedge... Sometimes you get a lot of cheddar and sometimes you don't.   I do wonder how many plastic bags they waste to mix their salads here: basically they put all your salad ingredients in a bag to mix it and throw the bag out. It's weird that a company that seems like they're on the forefront of revolutionizing fast food still wastes so much. I'm not a \"green\" person by any means, it just seems inconsistent with their image.  Other Freshii locations downtown seem to have \"day of the week\" specials ranging from $5-7. Not this location though, so I'd recommend hitting the one up on College if you're looking for something a little cheaper that's still close."}
{"text":"Everytime I order the cali bowl for breakfast the mango is HARD! How can you charge for crunchy mango.  Its sad that when a cuustomer orders they will have to specify RIPE fruits for sth that should be common sense. How hard is it to serve ripe fruits?"}
{"text":"It's great to have a healthy option close to work! Freshi on bay is a tiny spot where u can only grab and go!  I usually order a falafel teriyaki twist! It's my favourite there, the potion is huge and would definitely fill you up!   My order contained: brown rice, edamame, crispy wontons, carrots cucumber, green onions, teriyaki. You have he choice to add the type of protein you want, I chose falafel.   As for the price of my dish it was around $10"}
{"text":"Truly flavorless food. My noodle dish really had nothing to recommend it. I added salt. I added shiracha. I asked for more peanut sauce. It never rose beyond bland."}
{"text":"Wow what a great addition to Northern Hills.   I stopped in absolutely starving and not wanting a typical fast food, carb loaded breakfast. I ordered the Huevos breakfast bowl a detox juice to go and two little energy bites. I paid about $15.   The Huevos bowl was so good! Fresh kale topped with eggs, black beans, onions and avocado. Some spicy BBQ sauce and cheese topped it off. It was great. Very tasty and satisfying.   The fresh juice is delicious.   The energy bites are little balls of oats, peanut butter, coconut and chocolate chips GOODNESS. I would like a box of these to go.   My new favourite fresh food restaurant!  Definitely stop in if you enjoy eating healthy delicious foods."}
{"text":"I tried one of their most popular rice bowls (the one with the crispy wontons) with extra chicken. I was a little disappointed with the amount of chicken added in (although it was somewhat expected given that it was $2 extra). The spicy yogurt that came with the bowl was delicious and works great with the rest of the bowl. Everything was fresh and there was plenty for a meal."}
{"text":"Meh. Here's a tip for first timers - the noodles are hot, all other ingredients in your bowl are not. Also, this place is vegetarian unless you want chicken, steak or turkey.   The food was ok, and the wifi worked.  -30-"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a healthy lunch.  Lots of veggie options and you can customize whatever you order.    The menu has salads, wraps, rice bowls, noodle bowls, and soups.  I always have to include sriracha to add some flavor and, fortunately, they have bottles on the tables because I can never have too much sriracha."}
{"text":"+ Their smoothies are DELICIOUS! I love the green smoothie (kale, avocado, yogurt)  - Rice bowls are OK...the noodle bowls are a horrible, clumpy mess."}
{"text":"A good grab and go Freshii location but there's hardly any room to sit down and enjoy your food. Another drawback of the small space is that you can't see the servers make your order, so it's hard to provide direction for how much sauce/veggies you want etc. Overall, they make a decent bowl and the service is good."}
{"text":"Boo. Their salads are way too small and dinky for the price! No value here, even though salad tasted good it was not a substantial meal for almost $11!"}
{"text":"Guess I should have known not to get a steak Tex Mex burrito at a place like this. While the other ingredients seemed good, the steak was cold and flavorless. No kind of seasoning and tasted like it was cooked yesterday and put in the microwave for a brief heat up. It had that \"let's cook meat in a microwave!\" type taste.....disappointed."}
{"text":"Last year, this place would have gotten a 4 star review but they've changed their menu, restrict the choices your can make with your order significantly and charge you through the roof for something that is just not that good anymore.   I use to come here at least once a week. After the changes, I've been three times...in 8 months.   If you want to pay a fortune for salad, try the Sandwhich Box just down the street. At least they have a quality product, bigger more spacious shop so you don't get that sardine feel while you're ordering your meal and endless options on what you put in your salad.  Note: If you work at any of the retail stores in the area, and can prove it Freshi will give you a 10% discount."}
{"text":"If you're on campus, this is one of the few vegan options that doesn't require a lot of customization. While I'm all about supporting businesses that have vegan/vegetarian offerings, the price is a bit steep, especially considering the food portions and flavor. I usually spend about $8-10 here for a bowl, and while it's pretty good (relative to other campus options), it's usally not flavorful enough on its own."}
{"text":"good eat healthy option in the area but food isnt really that good.  the bowls they have designed are not really a good blend. better off making your own ."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  If you want a salad that fills you up and is more than just spinach leaves, you might end up shelling out more than $10. Protein portions are so small, if you're doing P90X, you probably need triple protein, but double protein will suffice. Egg whites as a topping option, so P90X-approved.  I do like the options, and have gotten some really good salads. The rice bowls are decent, too. Calorie counts are available online, if you are eating a salad, this is probably important to you. And this might make you reconsider all the toppings that make many of the Freshii salads upwards of 800 calories.  I'm so proud that this was a Toronto start up that made it big (albeit after he move to Chicago)."}
{"text":"Freshii is a great discovery in the food wasteland of Yonge & St. Clair. Except for the Charity Juice bar beside Good Life (where my friend Drew works) there is no option for a flourlesss meal that is to go at this $.  They have my standing order & when they see me 2-4x's per week ~ on it goes. I get double veggies & all the fresh (3kinds) of lettuce they can pack in - to squeeze the top down! Its a great high energy - low protien meal. With my work, gym, home & meeting's in the area ~ I don't feel so left out!"}
{"text":"RIp-off! I bought a groupon that they refused to honour because their antiquated system (basically manually just crossing off a list, they must have crossed off the wrong one) said I had redeemed it when I had not!   Other times I've been here because there are hardly any healthy alternatives in the neighbourhood and their topping quantities are pathetic. Their kale bowl literally has 2 shreds of kale and the rest is rice. Same on the salads, all the toppings sound great until you open your order and it's all lettuce! They parse out their toppings like its caviar!  Try Druxy's in the St Clair Centre food court for way better salads that actually have toppings on them!"}
{"text":"Elevator Review: Good fresh food in a large portion at a reasonable price. Give yourself a few extra minutes.   I was really excited when they announced Freshii was opening in downtown. This type of restaurant is the perfect addition to the ever-expanding list of downtown lunch options.   I ordered the Pangoa bowl with chicken. The ingredients were fresh and the overall bowl looked fantastic - really colorful and inviting. The composition of the bowl felt a bit off - a higher ratio of corn and black beans vs avocado and chicken, but it still tasted great. And overall the portion felt quite large - I didn't actually finish the whole thing.   The process felt a bit longer than I expected - both the wait in line and waiting once I ordered. But the staff was super friendly (the owner was actually chatting with folks as they waited in line), so I chalk some of the wait to the fact that its a new restaurant that is finding its groove.   I want to go back soon for breakfast and to try some other options. If you want a healthy, fresh option for lunch in downtown give it a shot."}
{"text":"Overpriced for just mediocre wannabe healthy food. I got a Mediterranean bowl with chicken and it was $11. I was expecting it to actually taste good and have something special about it. It didn't. Unfortunately, this place is one of the only healthy places on campus to eat at so I might come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Decided to have a healthy breakfast from here after reading up on a few reviews. The employee suggested his favorites from the menu, along with the nutrient facts. Needless to say, the meal was fantastic! *Added chicken"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love tacos and burritos so there's no surprise that we enjoy Chipotle and embarrassing places like Taco Bell. If you want bold flavors and a way healthier alternative then Freshii is the place!   We both order the Tex-Mex Burrito just to stick to what we like. It hits the spot, satisfying and I'm able to eat 2 in one sitting without feeling disgusted or guilty. That's not something you'd be able to do at other Fast Casual chains.   Pros: - Fresh, healthy and delicious tasting food not lacking in flavor.  Cons: - EXPENSIVE!!! $13 for a single Burrito!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I LOVE this chain and this review is only for this location. The food is delicious. However, the portion sizes at this location are half of other locations across the country. The first time I went to this location I got my Pangoa bowl and noticed my avocado was one tiny slither. I asked for more and got another small slither. I didn't go back for a while because I was really turned off and I just went back today and it was the same issue! I am very disappointed and will not be returning. Go to another location if you can!"}
{"text":"Their Buddha Satay was amazing. It was fresh and delicious, which was a nice change from a lot of the local chinese places."}
{"text":"This is the only place I eat in the food court. Their Khao San burrito and Oaxaca Bowl are realllly good. Vegetarian, healthy, very tasty and big portions w/o feeling gross after."}
{"text":"Bad food and bad service, what more could you ask for in lunch spot?   I recommend trying many of the other options in the Yonge and Bloor area. For a similar price, Flock is much better and there are a number of small, independent spots for health food.   Avoid Freshi if you can!"}
{"text":"I ordered the banana nut crunch smoothie based on a review here, it was perfect consistency so I think it was the difference of employee skills. The Tex Mex burrito with falafel was also very satisfying. Although the the place is vegetarian you can add steak, chicken and tuna to any order. I Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hooray!  Finally some healthy fast food in Madison.  Had the baja burrito with tofu, and my daughter had a teriyaki twist rice bowl.  Very very filling but not gut bombs.  Will be back!  Hope this place can last :-)"}
{"text":"I liked the presentation and what they seen to be trying to do but to be completely honest I feel like I just paid a fortune for some romain lettuce and carrots in what looked like an airport quick serve carton. The quality was ok but we are talking some inexpensive ingredients. I will try again and revise my review but I just was not wowed by the value."}
{"text":"I thoroughly love this place! It was so busy but they still maintained prompt service. All round good vibes and excellent healthy foods! I had the Pangoa bowl, it has a kick of heat in the sauce:) wish there were more locations"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Freshii at this location since it opened several years ago. It's a solid stop for lunch/supper. The staff are friendly and the service is always quick (even when they're busy).   My favourite Freshii meal is the Zen salad (sub cilantro for crispy wontons, spinach only/no romaine, hold the dressing and toss with siracha). I LOVE that they'll customise anything on their menu. And I'm seriously in love with that Zen salad... So much so that I just realised that I forgot to snap a picture of it... Oh well, I'll be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"A new \"fast food\" restaurant located on Grant Street is always welcome!  For those of us who walked by the sign in the window teasing of a grand opening for months, it was Super Awesome when it finally happened. I was so excited when it opened that I ordered a salad and a soup, and could not wait to dig in.   In retrospect, $19.00 was *entirely* too expensive for the tiny, tiny portion of salad that was served and the quart of soup. Yes, the salad had a nice flavor... but it tasted like a small salad and nothing more. The lemongrass soup was flavorful, not authentic, and the portion size was generous. Considering I can enjoy a larger bowl of vegetable soup at an Asian restaurant just a few blocks away for almost half the price, jam packed with fresh vegetables, Freshii does not offer a good value there either. The best $12 salad still goes to Bluebird Kitchen on Stanwix or Villa Reale (based on price, quality, serving size, healthiness).  My coworker swore on his mother's grave that the Oaxaca bowl was amazing. I went back for the Oaxaca bowl with chicken later that week. The Oaxaca bowl with chicken was, in all honesty, mostly a bowl of kale (some of it brown and wilted), two tablespoons of rice, a tablespoon of chicken, a tablespoon of beans, a teaspoon of corn, two slivers of avocado, a tablespoon of salsa, and a dried up lime wedge for just under $10.00.  The lovely woman at Sree's will triple the quality, flavor, and caloric intake for $3 less.  We bought a POUND of kale for Ribolitta on Sunday and let me tell you -- the amount of kale in my bowl was about 35 cents' worth AND old. Not to be deterred from making Freshii my new \"Go-To\" destination for lunch, I tried the Oaxaca bowl with chicken again, thinking maybe it was a blip, but had a repeat experience. Don't get me wrong, who doesn't love kale, right?  I also love popcorn but am not going to pay $10 for a small bowl of it.   The employees are very nice, friendly, and I will give credit to management for trying to shepherd customers through the ordering and pick-up process. The layout is strange, but they're making as good use of the space as is possible.   Perhaps I will try again in a month, after they've had some longer run-time."}
{"text":"Convenient for a quick lunch. Tastes fresh. Like any other chain location though. Very much like food court style dining. Seating for about 12-20 depending on each \"party.\" To be honest, felt a little bit like eating at an airport vendor but better? If that makes sense. Because of the size, convenience, prices, etc. Very much like all surrounding vendors though (strip of just food options).  Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant!  Jack and his staff do a fantastic job! Food is very delicious and it is so healthy!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick and healthy lunch to bring back to work so I stopped in at Freshii on College and was surprised to see it mostly empty. Thankfully, as this was my first time there, I didn't have to get in any confusing line to order but I could see how it could be frustrating when it is busy. I got the Tex Mex burrito with chicken and it was just meh. My hunger was satiated but the taste was very bland, the ingredients were not super fresh tasting and the price for a standard burrito was much too high for the other burrito options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm really happy that Madison now has a Freshii! I love coming here to pick up lunch (Pangoa Bowl, add chicken, sub the BBQ sauce for the lime-cilantro dressing = SO GOOD!) I love the simple, colorful decor in the store and their beverage options - Not just sodas, but LaCroix flavored sparkling H2O! Yes! That's a win in my book.   However, it is not quite as healthy as people seem to think - You can find all the calorie counts on their website. I believe my lunch is close to 1,000 calories. Portions are on the larger side and prices are fair for the amount of food you get, in my opinion. Freshii will deliver if you're within a certain radius. Salads, wraps, burrito bowls, smoothies and soup are just a few of the menu items. You can build your own \"custom\" lunch if you'd prefer.   Check it out, try something new!"}
{"text":"We were only here for about 45 minutes as we prepped for a meeting.  The juice drinks were decent for the price and they had free WiFi.  Overall it was clean and well lit.  The only downside was the truly disinterested employees and random people trying to talk to us while we prepped."}
{"text":"My coworker and l wanted a lighter lunch and we thought we'd check out Freshii.  I was unsure of what to get.  My coworker had the Smokehouse Burrito with chicken.  It was very round and substantial.  I settled on the Pokii bowl as it had the flavours l liked ( ginger, sesame seeds, avocado) and l had it with brown rice.  I was surprised by the heat from the dressing but the pokii bowl was very disappointing. Mine did not have the sesame seeds on it. There was also no avocado, despite the advertising picture.  There was ample kale and carrots but no avocado.  And the pickled ginger slices were too much whole.  They needed to be chopped as the ginger bite was tooo much. The tofu could have done with a bit of colour, maybe a quick turn on the grill would add a whole lot of colour and flavour too.   There was a whole lot of crunching and chewing and l ended up not finishing my bowl.  Overall disappointing.  I would return and try their other offerings, but it might be awhile before l do. I am glad there are healthier options available to people who are wanting to eat cleanly."}
{"text":"Next week will be our 3 year anniversary of being open in Madison. Thank you to all the supporters and Freshii Fanatics! Our goal is to make it convenient to get a meal that tastes great and makes you feel energized. The quality and quantity of our food is terrific and believe that eating cheap fast food can lead to more costs for health reasons down the road. If you have any questions or requests, feel free to ask at the store. Yes, we serve frozen kefir at our location. We do have a couple special dishes that are not on our regular menu that we can make if you ask for it. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, every meal is designed by nutrionists to make you feel like a champion. Just ask Lionel Sanders, current world record holder of the Ironman Triathlon race!"}
{"text":"As far as healthy options go in the area, I think this is one of the better. Decent variety of options - salads, soups, wraps & rice bowls. I think the biggest pro of a place like Freshii is how customisable it is, which is fantastic for people who are specific with their taste or have dietary restrictions.  They have a reasonable range of juice/smoothie drinks (bottled) in addition to regular pop, and there's an array of snacks that are on the more healthy side (popped potato chips, nut selections, protein bars etc) if you want a little extra to go with your lunch.  I find the major drawbacks to be the lack of size choices (especially for salads or soups) and the cost - for food that's made primarily from fresh produce it shouldn't be as pricey as it is. Plus, it's very much a to-go place - the one time I did eat there I felt like I was getting in the way of the lineups getting theirs to-go. When I can't stand to face another boring garden salad from Metro, this place is a welcome change."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Came here on the weekend and I feel this could be a good place if the staff had better training.   CLEANLINESS  One staff member in the middle of preparing food went to punch some things in on the cash register screen but then didn't change her gloves when she went back to making food.   ORDER EXECUTION  I ordered a wrap and asked for no tomatoes. I got a ton of tomatoes.  My wrap was supposed to come with cheese but it came with only a few shreds as if they started to put some on but thought 'Oops! I didn't mean to do that!' My lunch buddy's wrap was also lacking cheese.  My wrap was so loosely rolled I couldn't hold it to eat it. I ended up using a knife and fork to eat it which is fine considering I had to pick out all the tomatoes. My buddy's wrap was tightly rolled and looked a lot smaller than mine.   FOOD QUALITY The food tasted OK but there must have been tons of hidden salt because an hour later we were dying of thirst. Our wraps had canned beans so maybe that was the culprit."}
{"text":"I think the salad or grain bowls from freshii is a great deal, assuming that you keep your premium topping which you pay for to a reasonable level. I would often order a quinoa bowl with some chicken and it only comes out to about $8 range and they give you quite a bit of food.  The huge problem which prevents me from giving a higher rating is their inconsistency of understanding what I ordered. If you order a custom bowl you choose the items through a piece of paper on a clipboard. This is a pretty efficient way to do things but the problem is whoever is reading the paper can easily end up missing what you checked off, especially if they are busy.  It is very frustrating when you order a chicken bowl and all you end up with is edamame as your source of protein. Maybe they can digitize the process and replace the workers with bowl mixing machines in the year 2050 but until then be prepared to not get what you ordered from time to time. Of course the random time when you get even more than what you ordered or being forced to try new things can be a pleasant surprise but not getting what you specifically wanted can be annoying."}
{"text":"I agree. Haters will be haters and love to complain. Especially if you have had one bad experience doesn't mean this establishment deserves one star. I had the teriyaki bowl and it was fresh filled with so many healthy options. The staff was kind and I would definitely recommend a quick, healthy, tasty option as part of your day."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review. Though not inherently bad or deserving of a 2 (as I'll still always eat at a Freshii over a burger & fry based fast food joint), when compared to other vegan/vegetarian focused establishments in the city, Freshii just doesn't hold its own. It's like the lower quality cousin of Fresh and Urban Herbivore. And I just can't get behind it for that reason."}
{"text":"I haven't been there since October, when I was taking advantage of their \"buy nine, get one free\" punch card. I think I OD'd on their vegetarian wraps that month.  But overall, I love freshii. Their ingredients are always, as the name suggests, fresh. For someone who is used to eating rabbit food, it's a great place to have a quick meal/snack. Also, they offer neighbourhood discounts (10%) to those who work in retail stores around their locations."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Freshii (generally, not this location) so when I was hungry for lunch in the area I decided to stop by this one. It's shared with a Yogurty's.  I got the daily special - the $5 Warrior Bowl, which I added chicken to. What a disappointment. The extra $2 for chicken gave me maybe four skinny one-inch pieces of chicken. The bowl, consisting of brown rice, carrots, corn, beans, and red onions was unexciting - I could make this at home with no work at all. There was waaaaaay too much red onion, and it was all large slices. You would have to really like onion to enjoy it. The slices weren't even cut properly, they were still stuck together. I thought the $5 for the bowl was unreasonable - do people seriously ever pay the regular $7.50 for just this??  The dressing, however, was pretty great. I don't think anything else is seasoned so that's where all the flavour came from.   So my lunch wasn't terrible. It was even kind of tasty, with the dressing. But it was unexciting, underwhelming, and overpriced. Enough so that I'm reviewing a chain, which I wouldn't otherwise think to do so for a chain."}
{"text":"Love the healthy options but a little on the pricey side (as is all healthier food options). But it's worth the money and they don't skimp on the stuff. My wrap was stuffed and made me feel very satisfied and full.   You can make your own by checking off a little order form with what you want. Or pick from their choices on the menu.   Soups, rice bowls, wraps and salads. Delicious."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever!!!! The Eastern European girl at cash is incredibly rude! I ordered a customized salad with a lot of toppings (as a dinner for two ppl) and she was rolling her eyes the entire time and said \"it is $22 total!\" with an attitude, implying  \"can you pay $22?\". Why the hell would you care! I can clearly see on the screen the total amount  and if I'm not saying take XYZ out then it is freaking fine w me. Never going back to this place!! Do not recommend to anyone either!!!"}
{"text":"Got sick both times I had lunch here. I guess I'll just refer people I dislike to this location lol instant food poisoning."}
{"text":"I ordered the Green Energy drink and it was for $6.77 with tax.  I would expect fresh juice, i.e. make it in front of me, and i don't mind waiting at all.  I really do not like the fact that they make the juice beforehand and place it in the fridge.  The customer service was kind of average unlike other freshii locations where i have been to.  Hope the management do something to ensure the freshness of the juice as i love freshly squeezed juice.  That's also in the name of the company."}
{"text":"I love the wraps here! They recently completed a large reno and changed the menu, and everything looks great.   If you've never been to a Freshii, they give you little clipboards so you can come up with your own wrap or salad. On the new menu, the wrap I usually make is actually cheaper! It's only 80 cents or so, but a giant wrap with chicken and tons of veggies for $9 isn't all that bad.  All in all this is generally a pretty healthy place to go for lunch, and the service is very good.  My only complaint is just how crowded it gets at lunch, meaning you can end up waiting a while for your food. This location is also very small, so don't expect to be able to find a table."}
{"text":"I'm really sad that I have to stop going to this Freshii location but the food has been sub-par over and over again. I love the idea of Freshii and most of their meals sound delicious but the quality isn't great. Twice I've ordered wraps with chicken and the pieces were so dried out that they were becoming hard. Some pieces were un-chewable and that was really gross. They don't mix their salads or their bowls so it's tasty for the first 5 seconds and then it's all dry leaves.  Freshii I want to love you so let me love you! Please have better quality ingredients and prep so your delicious sounding meals actually taste good."}
{"text":"Nice staff, organized. Delicious healthy fast food. Bamboo Bowl is my favorite. The Pangowa Bowl is a close second. Try their frozen yogurt too."}
{"text":"Loved the spinach and egg \"egg pocket\". Perfect for breakfast on the go or just a quick meal! I added a little sriracha sauce for an extra kick. Also got the Recoverii smoothie! Perfection! You also have the option to add protein to it for a post-workout treat. The staff was friendly, the seating area is clean and bright, and the price point is great for the quality."}
{"text":"Tried the food here and its good just way too pricey especially since their menu prices don't include meat. The price of their daily special went up from $5 to $6. Working in the area there are limited options for good food however I have surprisingly found my dessert fix right here for under $4.  I order their frozen yogurt (half size which is almost full anyways) which comes with 2 toppings, cinnamon & honey every time and it will blow your socks off! I would much rather eat this then get Starbucks or something overly fattening at Timothy's/Tim Hortons"}
{"text":"So happy we have some decent, healthy fast food on the west side of town. Very nice breakfast menu, with not too much bread with the breakfast pocket (I got the meat version they offer). The yogurt/berry/granola parfait on offer for breakfast is great if you don't feel like oatmeal, burritos or sandwiches, but I would ask that they not add honey, as it was a little too sweet for me. Local coffee, True, is served.  The salads and soups are terrific. If you would like your salad, soup or wrap custom made, they can do that. Many ingredients to choose from. This seems like a great place if you are doing a juice cleanse, are vegetarian/vegan or have food allergies (on their local menu tab on the site online, they have a list of their ingredients that may trigger allergies.  Added bonus: They have a few tables outside and customers can bring their dogs to sit outside with them."}
{"text":"This place was great! The Tex Mex Burrito was amazing. The prices were good and service was prompt. I'm going to recommend this to friends and family."}
{"text":"I really thought I'd hate it based off of my preconceived notions that it sucked. It was hard to decide what to order because I thought I would hate it all, but once it was my turn, I blurted out \"market wrap\" nervously. No added protein. $9, expensive. Oh god what was I thinking? On the way home, wrap in my hand (not warm--I thought it'd be warm), I kept berating myself. This will suck, I'm an idiot...  But when I bit into it-it was great! So many flavours, crisp, and ... Fresh.  Good portion size. I didn't fail!"}
{"text":"I'm at a loss as to how many stars to give Freshii.  They can be quite inconsistent at times and an even bigger issue is the fact that they occasionally let items you didn't want into your dish! (big issue for those with allergies and food sensitivities).   The ingredients are always fresh and the food is tasty but they occasionally forget ingredients which can really ruin your lunch (my friend's tuna wrap was missing the tuna last week).  The staff are mostly friendly and helpful, giving occasional suggestions. Sometimes they look downright annoyed. I suppose that's not a surprise given how busy it gets at lunch.  This place is phenomenal value for your money and customizes everything to order. And is a great place for vegetarians to get lots of protein!   Some days I'd give them 2 stars while some days, I'd give them 5! I ended up on 4, giving them extra points for being environmentally friendly in their choice of serving containers and for free delivery!  I suggest skipping the soup and sticking to salads and bowls."}
{"text":"Love to see a place with healthy food options. I had a hard time deciding between the salads, wraps, bowls, and soups.  I ordered the fiesta salad, and it was really good AND I felt good about eating it! Freshii is unique in that it offers quinoa & kale based meals! It's nice to see a place that caters to healthy eaters but is still reasonably priced. I'm really excited to try out the make-your-own salad/wrap/bowls."}
{"text":"I've had the cobb salad and the cobb wrap from here a couple times and it was yummy. But I do agree with some of the other reviewers here in that the service is unbearably slow. I mean, it's an airport, most people have somewhere to be!  If you have all the time in the world and are waiting around, then no prob, come order something. But if you thought \"ouu Freshii! I'll grab one before security to run to my flight, it'll only take a few minutes\" then forget it."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this location. I came here o order a quick meal to go. First of all the lady who took my order tried to sell me a wrap, which has gluten in it. She assured me the Whole Wheat Wrap was gluten free. I then explained to her that wheat is a form of gluten and that must be incorrect. (I called later that day and spoke with a manager who said the wraps are not gluten free and I let her know that it might be a good idea to train the staff on food intolerances. The manager had no desire to listen to my comments. If I was to eat the food, I would have been poisoned!!) After I ordered my rice bowl, 20 people who ordered after me were served and I still had not received my lunch. I only had 20 minutes to get my meal and eat to make it to my next appointment. After 20 minutes, I asked the lady where my meal was. She then told me the printer didn't print my receipt, so no one made my rice bowl. I wanted to cancel my order at this point and then she began to make it. 30 minutes later, I received my dish. At this point I had no time to eat it and had to get on the 407 to travel to my next appointment, since this establishment made me late. This was a horrible experience and I am not thrilled to go back.  I called to complain afterwards and the manager offered me a complementary meal on my next visit. I'm not sure when I will go back but I will keep you all posted on whether or not it is better than this horrible experience."}
{"text":"Why are they closed on a Tuesday at 430 pm????? Pissed. How can I trust this location again to travel to if they're not open when they should be."}
{"text":"I visited this location yesterday and the staff were phenomenal. Both ladies working in the kitchen were super friendly and had great big smiles. They were knowledgeable about the menu and were able to help me select a gluten and lactose free dish.   The food was fresh and they allow you to substitute a topping if you are unable to eat it. I was really happy with my salad from this location. I will definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"Customer service from both times so far dealing with the male customer rep has been good. Mediterranean bowl is my go-to but not sure why their greens/salads are always so wet - to the point there is usually water that resides at the bottom of the bowl. I have Mediterranean bowls from other Freshii locations and they are never nearly as wet/soaked."}
{"text":"Finally downtown Pittsburgh expands the healthy lunch options. I stopped at the new Freshii restaurant this afternoon in the Union Trust Building. The service was very fast and efficient and the food was amazing! I got the pangoa bowl and also stopped at their new coffee bar, Union Cup, for a cappuccino. While this was a quick stop before going back to the office, I look forward to eating in there soon with the cool, modern decor and greenery on the walls. Any workers who want a fresh, healthy meal, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. I came here for a salad after my workout and it was really good!  I've been here two times and I will definitely go back. The restaurant is bright and clean. Stephen is the manager and he is really friendly and kind.   My first salad was to-go and they accidentally forgot to put on the avocado. To accommodate me, Stephen was kind enough to offer me a free salad on another day. That was really nice of him and something he didn't have to do.   My second salad ordered at this location was perfect. It was full of flavour and had delicious avocados. I would recommend both the Cobb and Fiesta Salads. Both are delicious!  I'm glad I stumbled across this location. Now I will be able to pick up a delicious salad on my way home or on my way downtown in the future. The food is fresh, healthy and full of good nutrients for your body.   The service is also really quick. I highly recommend this Freshii location if you are craving something quick and healthy.   The Freshii team is also more than happy to help you accommodate any dietary restrictions. They can also show you a list with the nutrition information for their entire menu."}
{"text":"Tasty, nutritious, organic food to grab on the run.    I had a wrap with quinoa, rice, and chicken. It was exactly as I expected it would be and by far 10x healthier than McDonald's...served in about the same amount of time.  I wish this place had a drive-through though.  I arrived with my allowed $10 budget for lunch and was a little taken back by the price. It's expensive. This would be five stars all the way, if not for cost.  You can't put a price on your health, so I will be a supporter of Freshii because I want them to continue be an available option in Madison."}
{"text":"I ordered a frozen yogurt.   The taste is quite nice, it comes in one flavour (tart/vanilla), but the one flavour in my opinion is really good.   The price point for the small and the large is pretty reasonable given the portion size.  So why only two stars - service.   For how much ballyhoo Freshii makes about its being an upscale urban franchise, they apparently don't care that much about who is their front line servers.   No thank you, no hello, complete disdain for customers is what I saw from my own service and the service I observed before and after mine.  I do give props for what appears to be a good recycling program."}
{"text":"I usually love going to freshii and thoroughly enjoy their food, however this location is horrible. They charge me a different price every time I go and I always order the same thing and since then have ordered in ritual. They constantly forget my avocado or tell me my meal is ready and when I arrive they haven't even started it. Everyone seems lazy there except for the male making all the food. I'm never going there again"}
{"text":"I like freshi but this time I paid for chicken for my burrito, only to find that they left it out! How disappointing. By the time I realized I had already gotten back to my workplace."}
{"text":"Ordered a custom burrito and banana nut crunch smoothie online through their website and it came to $15.77 after tax.   The custom burrito comes with six toppings, a sauce/dressing, and rice or quinoa. You also have the option of adding other toppings for an additional charge, $0.25 for the regular toppings and $1 for the premium (e.g. avocado).   I tried to copy the Tex Mex burrito minus the cilantro, so I got quinoa, black beans, corn, chick peas, edamame, roasted red peppers, avocado (+$1), aged cheddar (+$1), and spicy yogurt. Honestly, I forgot that I even ordered aged cheddar because I didn't taste it at all. It was kind of bland, but extremely filling.   The online order pickup process could use some work. I arrived and went to what I assumed was the pickup area (as opposed to the ordering line). Instead, I was instructed to line up where everyone else was lining up to order. Thing is, I already paid online, so I didn't understand why I had to do that. Eventually, they asked if anyone had ordered online and allowed me to skip to the front of the line. I feel like they should just do online orders in the pickup area. Seems more efficient as I wouldn't be slowing down the line of people trying to order.  The banana nut crunch smoothie was really good. Very strong banana taste, which I love, but I would have liked it to be a bit thicker. More smoothie, less melted smoothie. I found the smoothie to be way too expensive. At $5.99, it was the same price as a basic burrito (minus the premium avocado and aged cheddar toppings.)  Not a bad alternative to the usual junk food but a boost of flavour wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"Their bowls aren't bad (they are overpriced, but that's nothing new for Uptown lunch places). But in recent months they've noticeably reduced the portion sizes, to a point where the actual serving bowl is about 1/3 full.  It just seems like a cheap tactic.   Couple that with the price and slow service, and other places are clearly better options."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, portions are large.  When I asked for extra quinoa, they were very generous and will definitely top you up.  If you are hungry after visiting Freshii, your stomach must be a bottomless pit!  I deducted one star for the impersonal service.  When you approach the counter and don't know what you would like, they hand you a sheet of paper and a pen/pencil to choose which toppings you would like.  I feel this step interfered with my interaction with the server.  There is also a language barrier which hindered my desire to ask for recommendations and have that connection.  It is a busy place, so I understand why they do it - but it still affected my overall experience.  The second star was deducted for the misrepresentation as a vegan/vegetarian friendly place.  Besides ordering one of the salads (I hate salads), the meat-free options are limited.  Even the desserts, such as the frozen yogurt, contain dairy (no soy yogurt up in here!?).  Overall, if you are just looking for lunch or dinner that is quick, delicious, with half-way friendly service - you will probably be satisfied by Freshii.  My coworkers LOVE this place - it just isn't for me!"}
{"text":"Great food! Staff is nice and service is very quick. I'm obsessed with the frozen yogurt here but I find the prices to be a bit much for some of the items."}
{"text":"Despite the unfavorable comparisons I've heard of Freshii relative to Fresh, Mam's, etc., I liked what I had here! I came last Wednesday evening and ordered the Buddha Satay bowl ($6) as it was the daily student special. Compared to what one must pay for a bowl around here these days, Freshii is definitely more than fair. I thought my bowl was very tasty - it had noodles, purple cabbage and greens, all lathered in a light peanut sauce. What I found a bit disappointing, however, is that I was expecting it to be a 'healthy' meal (the ads certainly paint the place as such) when it did not in fact feel like a very nutritious one (e.g. fried wontons to garnish the bowl, and overall ~500kcal and I believe 70g carbs, if memory serves). I'll be more mindful of this if I come back again to try something else. If you are looking for very prominent flavours or very nutritious options, I'm not sure if this is the place for you (try Fresh / iQ etc. for the latter, by the way), but for something that nicely balances the two at a decent price point, Freshii isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Love the food and service here. I'd recommend the baja burrito w/ chicken; it pairs perfectly with the sracha sauce that sits at every table. Also, the breakfast options are on par with panera! So glad this place opened up so close to home."}
{"text":"When I crave something healthy in the middle of the work week, freshii is my go-to choice!  I love the freshness, high quality and quantity of their ingredients.  No dinky little salads here!  I'm always lusting after their Cobb salad which while super pricy at $9.89, has never left me wanting more 'stuff'.  This salad has all the ingredients that I love (avocado! bacon! chicken! sweet corn! etc etc...).  You can also custom build your salads, and there are so many unlimited ingredients that you don't have to pay extra for.  It's a super small location, and when I go mid-week it's always full of the lunch crowd from surrounding businesses who do take-out.  Since it's in Yorkville, there are lots of outdoor spaces to sit at and eat in the summer.  You order menu items by grabbing and writing on their order form which they have in abundance attached to clipboards at the entrance.  My only beef is... over $10... for a salad!"}
{"text":"I like this place, and I really like the bamboo bowl with protein and extra veggies. Always a good choice when it's prepared right. What I don't like is every time I come close to 8pm (closing time) they are out of or don't want to make the ingredients for my bamboo bowl. I get it, it's 7:45, you've broken down your area, ready to go home, but don't screw me over cause you are lazy. I know you didn't run out of chicken or the special sauce, you just don't want to peel back the food wrap, and stay an extra 60 seconds. Now, 7:30 on Monday July 24th 2017, I roll up after a 12hr hard labor day, stoked about my bamboo bowl, and nope, closed. Cool you want to close at 7, change your hours from 8am - 8pm to whatever pleases you. Just as it pleases me to write this review and never drive out of my way to support your business again. Food is on point. Service blows."}
{"text":"After moving to the westside I've been searching for a healthy lunch option.   Have I found it?  Yes and no.  Too soon to say.    I've been here twice now.  First time had the Buddah's Satay.   Healthy and delicious though a little light on broccoli for my liking.  Also I added steak as a protein for $3.47.  The amount of steak I got for $3+ was embarrassing.  It seemed about a $1 of value so despite being delicious for $11 I expected more bang for my buck.   Visit two I went for the Oaxaca - wa ha ka - with no protein added.  Paid ~$8 and change.  Very flavorful and filling and feels like a winner.    I will be back as they have an extensive menu of salads, wraps, bowls and smoothies."}
{"text":"If you're a healthy eater... you're going to LOVE Freshii's! I only recently started trying to eat better, so this has been a great place to try to stop at during lunch. They have salads, bowls, wraps and burritos. Most options are set to go for the vegetarians with easy to add meat options.  If you choose to eat there, whether their is snow or rain outside, it will feel like a nice sunny day in the park. Some of their seating resembles park benches and Freshii's tables looks like (clean) picnic tables. Plus, they have a wall of what looks like alfalfa sprouts (fake... but from a distance, it looks real). Oh, there is also a free water station next to their coffee, makes it easy if you're thirsty and want a quick glass of water.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. I remember my first visit, not understanding where the meat was or that I could order it - they very patiently helped me understand. Order fulfillment took just a few minutes and I was on my way again."}
{"text":"Freshii.. what happened to you ! They used to make good portions and now the new staff make it very cheap and forget stuff in the orders.  They forgot Beets and cucumber . And gave me very sad cheap portions of the rest (I have like maybe 3 small pieces of chicken and not even the equivalent of a teaspoon of the rest of my vegetables. They added more noodles so I wouldn't notice.  But this is a vegetable bowl not a noodle bowl ! I've ordered the same thing for the past theee years and it keeps getting worst and worst . I paid 16$ for this and I'm not wasting my money anymore . Please manager do something or you are going to lose more loyal customer. Très déçu ..."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch from time to time and pick up a $6 deal of the day.  Lines get long around lunch-time so try to get something before or after the lunch rush, otherwise expect to wait some time. It's located right outside St Andrew station, so not too bad a location compared to the ones in the food courts.  It's Freshii, so most of the base stuff doesn't come with any proteins. You'll have to add another dollar or two to get it.  Food tastes good. Haven't had any issues. Disposable chopsticks are available though they're the sub-par variety."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Tehsin B.   My colleagues and I love this place and go there all the time for a quick healthy meal.   The staff are friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Yummy salads! You grab a card to write on and proceed to check off various toppings and ingredients you'd fancy in your salad. Sundries tomatoes, black sesame seeds, goat cheese, edamame, the list goes on. Great choice for a healthy lunch! Only negative is it can get a bit pricey for the product if you go overboard on toppings. I also like that they usually offer chocolate covered almonds in a small container next to the cashier... A few of those puppies is the perfect end to a complete lunch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is so fresh and delicious. A nice health option.  I had a buffalo salad with chicken. Don't usually get excited over a salad but it was so good.   Plenty of options here and definitely will be back to try more. The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I first ate at a Freshii in Boston last year. I was so excited to find out that I could get Freshii in Madison too! It's definitely got a  California feel to it. Spacious, bright, plant decor on the wall, tall ceilings.   When I ate there today for the first time, I was so relieved to be in that kind of space... Nice change from the plentiful burger and beer joints.  The Metaboost salad without goat cheese was delicious. It was no problem to add the beet slaw and corn. I had a Mighty Detox too. Yum. My brave carnivore friend had the Buddha Satay bowl and a smoothie. He had to request some extra sauce for the bowl which was a little dry, but other than that invests filling and delicious. Oh, and the cookies were sooooo good! Very coconutty.   Clearly this should be Google Map bookmarked for health-conscious vegans in Madison. Thanks, Freshii!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Healthy food and amazing staff that always make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times because there seems to be a lack of healthy food choices in the 'hood. My first meal was one of the \"healthy choice\" salads. The chicken on it was really bland, and really, the whole thing was a little bland. And I can't believe I paid $10 for a lunch salad.  The second time I went, I had a rice bowl, which was pretty good. Sorry, I can't remember the names of either items. Again, it was a little pricey.  I'm sure I'll go back though, since there are some days I just can't get my self organized enough to make my lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for their Buffalo wrap $7 lunch special. It comes out to $11.28 for a tasteless cold wrap. In fact they applied no discount and charged $1.99 for chicken. They said it was because of the chicken. Apparently a Buffalo wrap does not come with chicken.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place but it left me wanting much more. I stopped in for breakfast and got a smoothie and a breakfast burrito - neither had much flavor. The smoothie was really somewhat tasteless which was odd because it had a handful of ingredients. Kind of like how la croix sort of tastes like fruit. The Southwest burrito was almost there but needed something to pull it altogether. The eggs were sitting around or microwaved (sort of tasted like liquid egg or powdered egg), but either way were not made to order. Healthy food can be incredibly flavorful but both of these items just missed the mark. Staff was friendly but they seemed a little distracted by the catering order they were working on - I was the only person in there and it took around 5 min before they even started on the smoothie."}
{"text":"Went there with my other half we were craving some salad for lunch. I asked whether the falafel contains cilantro and the response was \"I don't know because I binned the box\". So falafel is not so freshii. Since there is no facilities to cook really I presume all meat and soups are not fresh but processed, which beats the purpose of this place"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan, even though they are new and still clearly ironing out some kinks.   The most important thing is my wrap was delicious. I'm still thinking about it. I had the mexican kind of wrap -- can't remember the name -- with falafel. So good. The cilantro lime dressing was amazing, the tortilla was fresh, and it was all perfectly wrapped, which was awesome -- I hate when a wrap falls apart.   We came at noon and it took a LONG time. Like 30 minutes to get the wrap. And then halfway through eating it my friend an I both realized we were missing the add on (her chicken, me falafel). I was annoyed because their food is not cheap as it is and it was 2 extra dollars to add the protein. I'm glad we decided to eat in since we noticed while we were still there.   BUT, they are new and mistakes happen, the important thing is how they deal with it which they did very well. The manager offered us three choices -- give us the protein on the side, remake the wrap, or give us a refund. My friend chose her chicken on the side and I asked to have mine remade since I didn't want to upwrap the wrap. She had it fixed within one minute and gave us comp cards for a free meal. Awesome customer service.   I can't wait to go back but next time I'll probably make a point to show up at 11:45 or 1pm rather than right at noon with the downtown lunch crowd."}
{"text":"My Buddha Bowl with spicy peanut sauce was exactly what I needed after a day at the spa! It had so many fresh ingredients and was absolutely delicious. My first visit here was a hit. Everything on the menu looked good and the place was hopping!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place. As far as a quick-ish, healthy-ish lunch option, it's a great place. But it's pricey, and the staff is seriously lacking in customer service skills. Still, in a pinch on days when I forgot to pack my lunch, this is where I usually end up if no other reason than the food is tasty - my current favorite is the spicy lemon grass soup!"}
{"text":"Ordered a buddha satay with double chicken. I was surprised by the amount of food I received in the bowl. Normally when I get it during the daily special at a different location, I would probably get maybe half a bowl's worth of food.  I don't know if this freshii is just more generous with their meals or something, or freshii normally skimps out on the daily deals."}
{"text":"A Freshii location has appeared in the RBC Plaza, and it's already taking in the weekday lunch rush with a crowd of people waiting for their meals to be prepared. Almost every other food court in the PATH has a Freshii, but it's always convenient to have another one.  Offers the usual Freshii menu, but when I went, it didn't have the daily $6 special that is available at some other locations."}
{"text":"I had Freshii for the first time this week and I am so excited about it! I love that there is a new healthier lunch option on the West side. I had a Thai burrito (can't remember the name, but it had quinoa,  edamame, and red cabbage) with added chicken.  Flavors were wonderful, and I loved how the burrito was slightly grilled. I would say, the burrito was slightly heavy on quinoa, next time I may ask them to go light on quinoa and heavy on veggies. But, overall, I know I will be returning frequently!"}
{"text":"So I have a love/ hate relationship, used to recommend it my guest all the time but not anymore. To many times my order has been wrong, I get it ppl are human we make errors. Whatever, I normally wouldn't mind because one I am not a picky eater and two the staff is super nice, three I love the med bowl. My coworkers and I used to order from here quite often. Unfortunately I won't be back. I went in the other day with a large order from my place of work and asked to make two separate transactions. The owner/manager who ever the person was informed me that they don't like to do that because they get hit with a fee, followed by a back handed comment about doing whatever to make the guest happy. Ugh please explain to me what makes a difference. If my friend would have just gone with me? It wouldn't she would have paid with her card anyways. It was very off putting. Two stars cuz the guys work at the hand off was nice, he listened and didn't rush me. Kudos to you guy."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to visit this place with grass on the wall. I'm not a health fanatic but my wife is. She has a very strict diet and freshii allows you to order what you want in your food and what you don't. I always have to try a place at least once. We tried the food I got a burrito and she ended up choosing a bowl. The staff were young and knowledgeable and the place was full of millennials. The food was tasty and nice sized portions for the high prices we paid. This place is a great place for health lovers! Need something healthy and quick, this is the place to check out."}
{"text":"This location is awful. I've tried freshii on 17th ave and it was nothing like this. I got the Buddha bowl and it was soooooo dry I had to go and pour my own hot sauce all over it for flavour. The noodle was so undercooked, it was almost crunchy. Give freshii a try but maybe just not this location."}
{"text":"Came in around 11-12 because their advertising caught my eye. They still had the breakfast menu up so I asked the workers at what time they were going to serve breakfast at. They checked for me and said they had already prepared for lunch time. So one of the workers gave me the pamphlet of the lunch menu and I decided to get the Buddha Satay which consisted of rice noodles, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, crispy wontons, green onions, and spicy peanut sauce. Now that I look back, I actually cannot believe that was a peanut sauce, it was delicious! The portion is okay for what you're paying for but the fresh ingredients are definitely a pro!  The store was clean, service was great, and I will be returning for lunch."}
{"text":"ok freshii. I was super excited to try something from the menu. looking forward to a healthy veg meal.  there was only one meal on the menu indicated as vegan (vegan wrap) so I went for it instead of ordering smth different and then ask to take out cheese and other non vegan ingredients.   and from that one only experience here are two lessons that freshii should learn before offering anything vegan.  Lesson#1 Vegans are not cows. We don't eat only grass (e.i.lettuce). 80% of my wrap was lettuce with sprinkles of corn, bits of sundried tomatoes and tiny bit of chickpeas.... huge disappointment.   Lesson#2 If one of the main ingredients is missing don't charge me for the replacement. They run out of spinach and it was one of the main ingredients of the wrap. They offered to replace it with lettuce for no extra cost. Now, whoever works as a dietitian there should know that nutritional value of lettuce and spinach are not comparable. To my request to replace it with kale instead I was told that it will be an extra charge.  Not happy.  not coming back."}
{"text":"If you want a healthy lunch, this is the place to go to! Service is good and they would give suggestions if you're not too sure about what you want.  Gets really busy during lunch hours.  My favourite is the Oxaca Bowl. Very flavourful and has the right amount of greens. I add tofu for protein - much better than chicken in my opinion.  In terms of price range, you're looking at $10-$13 per meal depending on your add ons and bowl. It's more on the pricier side but it's a healthier option.  They should have a loyalty program for customers who keep coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Freshii in Madison on 3/14 for lunch to see what it was like. We eat very healthy so were excited to have a place like this available. The menu looked good and we ordered a Fiesta wrap and Ninja salad. The order took awhile to prepare and actually sat at the Pick-Up area after it was completed until I noticed it and asked about it. My wrap was just OK and did not have much flavor. My wife's salad was small and did not look fresh - the spinach and romaine was limp - and there were very few toppings. Lastly, the Green Energy Juice did not taste fresh and was brownish in color. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Freshii is quick, tasty, and pretty Healthy compared to most fast food places. I usually always get the Kona wrap for $8.99 plus tax and it is super delicious! The wrap is whole wheat and comes with romaine lettuce, hard boiled egg, tuna, avocado, and honey dijon sauce. It is a protein packed wrap that is definitely worth the money.  My friends usually always get their salads which are an extremely popular item and you get a ton of salad. They have options from soups, chips, healthy smoothies, breakfast options, juices, chips, and you can even purchase a detox juice system for a pretty penny.  I recommend coming here if you are looking for a truly healthy alternative. Anybody who eats healthy on a regular basis knows that it is expensive whenever you compare it to regular junk food people normally purchase.  Carbs such as rice, pasta, and bread are all cheap compared to fresh lettuce, avocados, steak, and chicken so I think you get what you pay for.  Plus...you can never put a price on your health so I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So the food is decent but the only thing that really irks me about this place is the smoothies. Isn't the whole point of a smoothie a bunch a fruit and a little frozen yogurt? Their smoothies are a tiny 8oz full glass of frozen yogurt and literally like 2 or three pieces of fruit. For $7 for a smoothie give us our money's worth. You can get all fruit smoothies at the farmers market for half that price."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pangoa bowl. Rice was stale, old and crunchy, ordered a lemongrass soup, received a mushy alternative. I'd say this food was as fresh as my foot."}
{"text":"Amazing salads and rice bowls. Also love the soup. Huge portions an really nice, quick staff"}
{"text":"What a complete rip-off. My Fiesta salad cost just under $10 with no add ons (veggie). To make matters worse it was the most pathetic looking salad, with a few dull/old looking bits of corn and tomatoes. They also forgot the avocado. So basically $10 for 10 leafs of spinach. Thank god they had Sriracha.    Also they don't assign numbers/names to your order. So at lunch time, when the place is rammed, you better be paying attention before someone takes off with your food.  1 star is very generous"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Freshii location in the Madison area as I am a native Chicagoan and they are everywhere throughout the city. Freshii is a FRESH fast food eatery that offers healthy salads, wraps, bowls, burritos, soups, frozen yogurt, juices, and smoothies. My go to menu item is the Freshii Green Smoothie. It's loaded with kale, spinach, pineapple, and avocado and always satisfies. The best part about this green smoothie is that you can taste the green and it tastes great."}
{"text":"Came to Freshii today to meet up with a good friend from high school as he works close to the Financial District.  My intention was to be able to custom make a salad to control the amount of calories I would be consuming since I dined out for both lunch and dinner yesterday, and tonight is the Yelp event, which means lots and lots of boozing... especially this time around.   My salad consisted of:  Spinach Egg Whites (extra $) Double Protein: Oven Roast Turkey Breast (extra $) Feta Cheese (extra $) Sweet Corn Roasted Peppers Onions Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans) Mandarin Orange Cucumbers Diced Tomatoes Artichoke Hearts Sundried Tomatoes Cucumber Dill Salad Dressing  My salad came to a grand total of $13.99.  Some of the ingredients were missing (artichoke hearts, cucumbers).    For this price point, there are better places to dine at that will leave both your wallet and tummy feeling satisfied.  I also noticed the sodium intake from my sodium salad was over 1,000mg and this was further highlighted by a feeling of thirst upon returning to the office."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a relatively healthy fast food option, there aren't too many choices in the neighbourhood, or anywhere in general.  I do come here for the slightly over priced \"bangkok\" burrito (Brown Rice, Roasted Chicken, Carrots, Cucumber, Mushrooms, Bean Sprouts and peanut sauce) for $7, which is tasty for the most part, but nothing to write home about.  I don't get coming here for a salad when there are several markets in the vicinity.  But this place is busy during lunch hours and there is usually line up of girls coming out of their yoga classes.    The frozen yogurt is ok, but there's homade icecream just around the corner at xococava!  Yeah yeah.. it's not frozen yogurt but it's a billion times yummier.  If this was a singles pick up joint, I may give it a higher rating as it easily has a ratio of 3 to 1 women to men, but it's not so it gets a Meh."}
{"text":"Freshii is a nice alternative to the usual lunch fast food places around Yonge and St. Clair. I've never caught a line up longer than maybe 5 ppl so they're always fast to take your order.  What I like best about Freshii is that you have a lot of options for colder days. Their rice bowls and soups are filling and come loaded with as much or as little as you want.  Go for the custom ones to get the most out of everything they offer; that's especially important if you're counting calories. Some of their chef's menu items can pack in a lot of calories after they add bacon bits and heavy dressings.  I'm giving it a 4/5 because they did get my order wrong twice before. But every time I would call them to let them know and they comped my next meal to make up for it."}
{"text":"This place is confusing and nobody seems to know where to stand.  Are you in line? No, I'm waiting for my wrap.  Excuse me, I'm just trying to get out the fucking door, thank you very much.  Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out where to stand.  Will you hand me a pencil please?  The game Twister isn't even fun at home, I certainly don't want to play it while I'm trying to eat.  The place is too small to enjoy dining in and then you peer into your wallet and start to cry.  $26 for 2 wraps, 2 drinks and a bag o' chip.    It would have been much more had we built our own wraps.  It starts out around $6, but that's only the wrap and veggies.  If you want cheese and a protein, be prepared to fork over another $4-6 bucks.   If you want a coke you can forget it because all they have are Diet Coke and Coke Zero.  I get the whole 'healthy' eating thing, but please don't push your religion on me.  Diet Coke and Coke Zero are easily just as bad as regular coke!  I'm willing to give this place another shot, so maybe I'll go back when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"There is literally one person doing every job. Waiting 15 minutes for a smoothie that was $8 and the size of a Dixie cup. NEVER giving this place my business again."}
{"text":"Love this location! The outdoor seating in the summer is wonderful and inside always feels bright and airy. My favourite menu item is the Mediterranean bowl, the red pepper sauce they use in it is delicious! I usually ask for extra on the side so I can take it home. The portions are very generous, everything is fresh, and overall it's a very satisfying meal. When I go I also check out what other people order, as it's a good way to find something new to try. Staff are always friendly which is also a plus!"}
{"text":"Finally!  A health-nut's answer to convenience food.  The Freshii chain is smart.  They have fresh ingredients, thoughtful recipes and cater to all types of dietary restrictions.  The food is delicious and the smartest part of all: everything is fully customizable. If you want to completely do your own thing with their fresh ingredients...you can. I also appreciate that they don't needlessly add all types of sugar to their dressings and sauces. Plus their meat is hormone free. I hope they'll have more organic choices soon too.  The service was also great.  A friendly woman greeted us and explained their whole concept and system to us. Go to Freshii. Support healthy choices and lifestyles."}
{"text":"Quality not consistent.  I am not sure if this is a franchise but this location does not deliver the way the others do. The service was luke warm and be sure to check your order before you leave.  After ordering bacon, double the chicken and double the avocado- all of which you pay extra for- I got home only to discover they didn't put any of these items on my salad. I was pretty annoyed.  Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Enfin un vrai fast-food végé! En entrant vous trouverez le comptoir au fond derrière le comptoir centrale qui sert des jus frais. Délicieux et un beau menu pour y revenir souvent."}
{"text":"No honesty at all. When you ask for replacing one side to another side in your salad, they charge you double instead. They won't tell you the additional charge unless you REQUEST YOUR OWN RECEIPT AND FIND OUT. They will refund you if you notice and ask for it.  I am not going back. This is not how you do business."}
{"text":"This is THE place we have all been waiting for. Totally fresh, healthy, fast food. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The food was tasty, the place is very clean, and it's the nutrition we all need. The juices were quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"best salad, wraps and soups. and the best part is that they deliver. They are in the US, Austria, Canada, and UAE. Perfect, nutritious and attentive staff!!! and the best part is....at least in Toronto they deliver and they'z ONLY healthy!! I'm sold for life!"}
{"text":"I have never been into one of their locations but I have ordered from them all over Toronto and they have made this whole \"healthy bernstein\" not so difficult. They are really efficient. I fax them my order from work or email them my order from home and they deliver with in 30 minutes. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"The prices are high but the service is friendly and quick. By high prices I mean you could goto a \"real\" restaurant and spend about the same. It's a variety of healthy types of food at a higher price. I recommend the smoothies and burritos from my experience for value/taste. I do like the large abundance of vegetarian items and their quality."}
{"text":"Have they bumped up their prices? Had a chicken cob salad that was nothing special and quite small in my estimation. Salad was $9.79, chicken added $1.99 and came to $13.31 with tax."}
{"text":"We liked our first experience with freshii. Tasty and fresh! We took two different bowls - Mediterranean and the one with BBQ sauce. Both were great. I think we will be regular goers there :)"}
{"text":"Woot Freshii's first review!   They have a variety of healthy options here: salads, bowls, wraps, soups, and smoothies/juice presses. But so far I've only tried wraps, and they are yummy (and let's not forget healthy)! Every time I come here there's a lot of people either lining up or already seated and eating. The veggies and fruits are always fresh, and love how they have green apples and crispy wontons as toppings - very unique! The chicken used to be an extra $1 but now they raised it to $2 :(   Staff are nice and love the decor inside!   I'd give it a 4.5 because of price, but can't do half stars (I think?). Also they have daily specials for $5 so that's a pretty good deal! I've only come here after going to the gym cause I want to eat something healthy! And if you're a GoodLife gym member, you get 10% off so that's a plus :)"}
{"text":"So.. star bonus to the owners, first off. Both times I went in, not only were they very friendly and present, they had recommendations ready to go, kept the lines moving, and were very proud of their hard work launching this storefront. The location is extremely convenient, however plan to get take out because there is little to no room to sit and eat, even the expansion of seating in the back. It's a tad embarrassing (as a host)asking a small group out for lunch and not being able to accommodate a place to eat, but not really having been in before, it's something I should've scoped ahead of time.   That being said, I know they are a franchise, but hopefully some suggestions can be made. I wanted a wrap (no added protein) and soup. $16. They only serve large bowls of soup, no small cups as a side or a half wrap/half soup. I even still thought $8 to not have a protein added (extra $2) was a bit much, HOWEVER you have to remind yourself that these are premium, quality ingredients and that it is going to cost a bit more. I scrapped the soup off of my order.   Now onto the food.. I ordered a Tex Mex burrito. The flavors in it were amazing. However without a protein I think it was missing that fullness to the meal and I was left a bit hungry after, despite the size of the burrito. Next time I would definitely get falafel or chicken to give it a bump, but I feel lukewarm about paying $10 for a falafel wrap when there's authentic Mediterranean cuisine downtown that has falafel for less.   I typically circulate the same food places downtown weekly, and although I'll be back, I'm not sure I'll add this to my weekly repertoire of repeat restaurants that I rotate, only due to the cost and not being quite filled. However, the quality of the food and the flavor have kept me as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I think I didn't understand that this place was essentially a fast food restaurant for people conscious about eating \"healthy\" food. I thought I would be going to an actual eatery of some sort. The food here is more like a bunch of ingredients that happen to be sharing a dish or a wrap.  I had a smokehouse burrito. I would've been happier at Chipotle's. My vegan brother had a Buddha Satay and genuinely seemed to like it. I felt like I was being sold some sort of clean, conscientious, worldly image while being presented food from the deli cooler of a grocery chain."}
{"text":"Had the Tex Mex burrito and it was delicious!  I had the option to add animal protein, but I decided to try it as is and it was really good, not dry at all, and very filling. Good sized wrap with brown rice, black beans, avocado, corn and more.  My husband had the bamboo bowl and really liked it.  The price is reasonable for the portions, and the food is a nice healthy alternative to other fast food places in the area.  I also liked that their take out containers are all compostable/ recyclable."}
{"text":"This is a cool place I discovered in the library building downtown at Concordia. They have multiple sorts of wraps and other healthy looking things. I had a wrap with quinoa in it called the Baja. It could have used a bit more sauce of some kind but it was cool to have this healthy option so close to school. I'm looking forward to trying out some different kinds they all looked so good :)"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice now and gotten takeout bowls. Today was the Pangoa bowl; spicy barbecue sauce, lime wedge, avocado, warm brown rice, corn, tomato, cheese, cilantro and black beans. Hits the spot! You can add protein but I didn't today. With tax it costs 8.57 and weighs about 4 lbs.  Good and healthy is what I got and that's exactly what I wanted. They feature a special bowl that changes but not sure how often. They also have soup, wraps fresh squeezed juice and smoothies."}
{"text":"Freshii shakes are great however the young staff do not seem to care much what goes into them. I'm consistanty reminding them to put the protein power in that I ordered... the guy who owns it or is the manager is very friendly though and most defiantly carries his weight around There! He is always working when I am There!"}
{"text":"Call me blind, but I didn't know there was a Freshii in the back of Yogurty's on du Parc. We went there at the end of a busy day, and we were both starving. Eating healthy(er) has been a goal recently, so Freshii seemed like a good option.   Prices were cheap and there was plenty of choices. You can compose your own bowl with any of their available ingredients. For simpicity's sake we chose the Oaxaca bowl, which contains kale, beets, corn, black beans, avocado and crispy wonton on a bed of brown rice. The bowl was prepared bibimbap style, and everything was drizzled with a spicy yogurt sauce. The ingredients were all very fresh and yummy, but sadly I didn't like the sauce and struggled to finish my bowl. My boyfriend loved it, however - I think its his new favorite thing now.   Although I wasn't too fond of the food, I have to say that Freshii's interior was pretty nice. They have nice benches with comfy, colorful pillows, and the decor gives the place a cheerful, youthful vibe."}
{"text":"Popped into Freshii after getting our hair cut. We were really excited by the menu and ordered a Bangkok burrito with chicken and a spicy Thai burrito with chicken. Food was prepared pretty quickly, and we dug right in. The first few bites were tasty, but then the burritos lost all pretence of flavour. There was no seasoning whatsoever and definitely not enough dressing to sustain us. It was, however, very fresh and fairly priced for what we got. We didn't give the smoothies a try, but they looked pretty good so we might return for that."}
{"text":"It was ok. The food is just eh. I know it's supposed to be healthy and all but it was just bland to me. The burrito I got was ok, warm and filling but also just missing something. I love burritos but once you remove the meat there isn't much else I like as a replacement. They make it with beans and rice but there's no punch to it.They also didn't have avocado on the day I visited so that was a bummer.   I might give this place another shot because it is close to my school and convenient. Also they have good daily deals for students. The staff was super accommodating of my picky eater-ness too which always nice because sometimes I feel like I'm difficult."}
{"text":"I walked into this location to check it out. I ordered a Buddha bowl as recommended by the cashier, she said her name was Destiny. My order was processed and made in a timely fashion, which was nice. Destiny's recommendation turned out to be phenomenal and one of my new favourites. It was nice to walk into a restaurant where the employee's are knowledgeable about the products they serve. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Menu is unnecessarily complicated and it feels a little condescending. I'm serious when I say, older adults with a high-school or college-only education, will be confused. You have to know how to read it properly and order it, in the proper order, and there are little papers to fill out.  Also, the promotions are too strict and a little unfair. Right now they have a promotion with nearby gyms where you get 20% off your first purchase, 35% off the second, and then 10% off subsequent purchases. They meticulously verify your gym membership in their records and make sure you haven't already used the 20 and 35% discounts. So, new customers always get a better deal and existing clients. I would have rather seen a consistent discount card like 15-20% instead of these fluctuating discounts. After I used the 35% discount on the card, I brought in a new card so I could get the 20% off again, and they wouldn't let me. I found this arbitrary, because there's nothing on the website in Terms and Conditions which say \"One card per customer fore the lifetime of the promotion.\". When I go to a store and I have a pile of coupons, I expect to be able to bring a new one in each time and use it, unless the coupon specifically prohibits it.  To round it all out, the Fiesta wrap I got was bland. They were also out of tomatoes, not just once, but twice. Evidently, their supplier had issues - well, maybe they should change suppliers temporarily? Tomatoes are a fairly staple ingredient.   I will only go back, a) as long as the discount lasts and b) only if I'm in not in the mood for anything else in the area. One positive, is that you can order ahead with an iPhone app, also, another positive, is that the food, albeit bland, does indeed taste fresh.  I have also been to the Washington DC store, and it was a better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the Toronto airport.  Reasonably priced. I had a bowl with quinoa and veggies and it was fresh and tasty.  Would definitely go here instead of anywhere else in terminal 3"}
{"text":"I come here on my breaks from work. This is like the fast food version of fresh, as my friends would say. However, I find it to still be very much on the healthier side.   What I have tried: 1. Teriyaki twist bowl: 9/10. This bowl is very satisfying. I highly recommend 2. Pangoa bowl: 10/10. I love this so much. All the components of the bowl go together very very well. The only change I make to it when I order is to get a little bit less sauce because it is so spicy. However, although I don't like spicy food, I'd say this sauce is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"The only reason I go is because it's next to my work, but everytime i go i feel ripped off. You get so little for the amount you pay. And every additional thing you want they charge you double for it. It will be the last time I'm going. It's just another over-priced pretentious place."}
{"text":"SOOO YUMMY AND HEALTHY! Never knew about this place, and it's tucked away close to the west towne mall, but my roommate went there after the mall one day and raved about it. I stopped by this past weekend and OMG! It was great. They have bowls, wraps, soups, and FROYO! Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I always get a stomach ache after eating here. I don't think they keep their food clean or fresh. Many of my friends say their stomachs feel uncomfortable after eating here too"}
{"text":"I've passed by Freshii all over the city. I have always been apprehensive to take on a healthy menu. I always, always, opt out for the unhealthiest choices on the menu. When it comes down to healthiness and the dollar, the correlation is positive. The healthier it is for you, the more expensive it tends to be (nothing new).  I held out until now. I felt a change to the regular Tim Horton's lunch or Korean Chicken Combo at Ho Su. Freshii was a pleasant and delicious surprise.  I ordered the Warrior Chicken: Brown Rice dressed in ranch, onions, corn, carrots and strips of grilled chicken. The mix was not only delicious and filling, but it made me feel healthier after wards.   What a delight. Service was fast and there are many prepared mixes on the menu with the option of creating your own medley of course.  Overall, fast, filling and healthy for 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Giving a new 2 star rating to average my original post to a solid 3. Went to go to Freshii today about 20 minutes before they closed, 5 pm, and they were completely closed. No one inside all the lights completely shut off. This makes me believe they must have started closing at around 30 minutes before actual closing time which to me is unacceptable. It presents the impression that this location hires people who are lazy and don't want to be at work. I really do find it very unacceptable that this location was closed that early. Food is still great but this location may have lost a customer in me."}
{"text":"This is an exceptionally terrible location for Freshii. First, the staff seem miserable and don't even try to fake enjoying their work, which makes it very unpleasant for patrons. Poor customer service is always a turn-off.  Second, they had an item on their menu that they no longer made in store, which is deceptive and misleading. At the counter, the staff member's response to my question about the missing and non-existing item was utterly unsatisfactory too, which compounded the situation.  Finally, this Freshii doesn't allow you to make custom bowls, which is probably the best reason to even consider visiting Freshii, overpriced as it is. They should simply take down the sign, close up shop, and cut their losses... this place damages the brand and gives Freshii a bad name."}
{"text":"I've come a long way from being a hater of Freshii to actually appreciating the chain for what it offers.  After countless orders, here's the breakdown of the main pros and cons (imo):  Pros: 1) They serve up some mean soups here - make sure to try the tortilla soup! 2) The food is generous and super satisfying 3) One of the rare healthy spots around the UofT area  Cons: 1) Those unfamiliar with the menu items may be overwhelmed at first glance due to the lack of pictures and large selection 2) Quality is inconsistent at times...I find that they sometimes add too much or too little sauce and that really changes up the whole meal. Make sure to get sauce on the side. 3) Most of the ingredients are unseasoned, and the food only being flavoured by the accompanying dressing. This may result in taste being a bit 1 dimensional.  My favourite items from Freshii would be the Tortilla Soup, Oaxaca Bowl, and Buddha's Satay Bowl."}
{"text":"Freshii is okay. I sort of have a love/hate relationship with it, and I wish I could give it more than three stars.  I really like the concept of fresh ingredients, fresh food, minimal processing and vegan options. The idea behind Freshii is wonderful. But I really don't like the mediocre food that I receive at Freshii along with the high prices. The majority of the burritos at Freshii are just brown rice and/or quinoa -- so you're paying upwards of $10 for a bunch of grains. The $5.99 smoothies also come in little 8 oz. cups and taste very yogurt-y, so I don't know how much of the pineapple, spinach or other fruits and veggies really even make up the smoothie.   The meals I've had at Freshii have always been in need of more seasoning, more salsa, more sauce, more salt/pepper, or something else.   Chipotle has a somewhat similar \"fresh food\" concept, and you get much more flavor and a similar quantity of food for a lower price at Chipotle. So in my opinion, Chipotle still wins."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch today. This place gets busy quick. I didn't wait in line long though. I had the Tex Mex burrito. It was good. $11 with tax. I added chicken to mine. I'm curious to try their meal prep that they'll deliver. If anyone has tried it please let me know."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place because of a good friend of mine. The food tastes so fresh and it is vegetarian and vegan friendly.  The menu makes all the items sound so enticing, and everything I have tried to date has been delicious and satisfying! My only issue is the location and hours of operation.  If it were not for my friend, I would've never found this place and I do wish they were open past 4 pm or open up another location more convenient for those of us who do not work in Uptown in banking.  Other then that the food and service were great! It's a place worth trying if you can to Uptown during lunchtime."}
{"text":"When the cashier is texting and staring at her phone while you're ordering, that's when I walk away. Never eaten here either and wanted to try it."}
{"text":"I finally tried freshii today and I will definitely be back!! This is a great lunch spot especially if you're looking for some healthier options. I got the Mediterranean bowl with Chicken (quinoa, spinach, olives, cucumber, marinated peppers, feta). I also requested a side of siracha.  Omg it was amazing! I only ate half of the bowl and I was full. It had lots of flavor and was very refreshing. The bowl is typically $7.95, but if you want a protein it's extra. My total was $10 and it was so worth it!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea they opened a location in Scarborough but I will definitely be coming in often! I initially was hoping they had collard greens for their wraps but was told they are only a seasonal thing (Summer, incase you were wondering). I ended up ordering the cobb salad and added chicken. SO GOOD!!! The portions were perfect and I am still full from lunch almost 4 hours ago. The staff were also really great & friendly, which I always appreciate!"}
{"text":"It is so refreshing to have options in the midwest that aren't soaked in meat and cheese...and I'm saying this as a dairy-loving omnivore! Sometimes I just want brown rice and KALE. And I want it now.  I enjoy a wide variety of food choices...vegan, raw vegan, steakhouses, sustainable fish markets, you name it. They excel when they use fresh quality whole food ingredients rather than a bunch of processed soy crap. Freshii doesn't buy into that.  I love that I can eat a meal here and not feel like there's a brick in my stomach. I feel light and clean and pleasantly full when I leave. The portion sizes are great. There's an eco-conscious vibe that I love, although the ambiance is more cold & sterile than warm and inviting. I think a stark white wall with harsh bold black lettering on it might have something to do with that. I'd rather get their food to go than eat it there. Maybe it's nicer during the day, when there's some natural light? I think the juicing plan only makes sense if you're too sick to digest solid food. Your body needs fiber.  I usually get the Oaxaca bowl but I need to branch out and try other things. I also love that LaCroix bubble water is an option, and they feature lots of flavors, not just one.  I didn't give 5 stars because I feel like the flavors are kinda bland, but I also have a really advanced & adventurous palate. It takes a lot to really impress me. But they are fast & reliable with their fresh clean food and I always feel great after eating it, so that earns a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had a major love affair with this particular Freshii location when I first started going (a mere six months ago), but I'm quickly falling out of love.  I do love the seemingly endless amounts of options.  I love that I can walk in, take my time pondering a plethora of various toppings, and hand in my order form when I am ready to order.  The servings are large enough to fill me up for lunch (sometimes with leftovers), and I LOVE that I can get gluten and dairy-free meals without worry.  However, I hate, hate, HATE how often they get things wrong.  When you pay $2 to add chicken or $3+ to add bacon and egg whites to an already pricey salad/bowl/soup, it is completely unacceptable to get your food back to the office and discover that your protein is missing.  I also hate how often I find stuff in my dish that I didn't request.  Most of the time it's OK, but I feel like people go to a place like Freshii because they trust them to be careful, especially where allergies are concerned.  I am over paying $10 for a completely mediocre meal served by someone who never smiles and thinks her phone call is more important than ringing up your order.  If you are going to check out Freshii, wait until after 2:00.  The lunchtime rush is unbearable at this tiny restaurant."}
{"text":"The portion is small. I paid over $10 for a salad but it doesnt even fill me at all. The bowl is just a bit more than half full. I also ordered lemongrass soup which has the option with chicken or veggie but the server did not even ask me and gave me a veggie."}
{"text":"I think this location is the best I've tried throughout the City. The staff are always friendly and the food comes out consistently good. Glad there's a location by my house. It's good value for what you pay."}
{"text":"I've had Freshii now on numerous occaions for breakfast. I work in uptown and need to pass it walking into work from my garage - conienent location. The breakfast buritto and breakfast bowl are both pretty good. Personally, I think its a great and healthier alternative to it's neighbor - McDonalds. Don't let the bad or so so reviews turn you away - it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"ive been to many freshiis in my lifetime multiple times.  i just moved into the area ie my office is nearby...  thought id grab a avacado green smoothy it had kale banana in it etc...  proportions were extremely off.  had no taste felt like i wws swalliwing a avacado whole....ended up not finishing it.  6$ what a waste....not cheap for a drink so i expect it to be good..like a meal... i should have went back.  disapointed plus i feel like everyone trips on the doorstep on the way in.  poorly designed.    highly doubt ill come again especially because theres a few juicer places in the underground."}
{"text":"I came here twice in the last week and ive been to many freshiis in the past.  Every time i come here (i work nearby) im disapointed.  Salad always tastes weird.  They either put too much dressing or not enough.  I paid 20$ for my custom salad and it was drenched disgustingly in dressing untill my salad was sour.   The other time salad was so dry so i went to ask for.more dressing nixely and she looks at me like ive asked for an atrosious request.  This place gets busy bc there r offices nearby and not a lot of food optikns but hmm honestly seems like they just wanna take your our.money fast and need more trainning on porportions and customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great location! Always busy, fast and friendly staff and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Freshii.  Love - The food is good, fresh, interesting, and easily available throughout the city (locations seem to be popping up everywhere). So I'll eat here periodically - especially when I'm feeling the need for something healthy and quick.  Hate - The menu is complicated with so many customizable options, it's a bit overwhelming. So often I'll default to one of the recommended combinations (sometimes that works and other times not so much). And it always pains me a bit to pay $15 for a salad that I could make myself for much less. But I just don't have the time or inclination to do it.  Overall, I'm super happy Freshii is available and close to my work - it's a default option for those times when I'm rushed or hungry for a quickly purchased, health option to take to go."}
{"text":"Uber friendly and happy staff. Fresh whole food smoothies with frozen kefir, salads, and wraps. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the tex mex burrito w/steak."}
{"text":"Great service and fast. Quality food was delicious. I am picky and would have preferred cooked to order products instead of reheated."}
{"text":"I love visiting Freshii! The food is delicious and healthy and prepared fresh! The juices are also excellent. The smokehouse burrito is my favourite in all the GTA! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious as well as healthy. Customizable and fresh (as per the name)! The staff was helpful and warm. Loved it."}
{"text":"I now hate this place.  Freshii, the franchise, still holds a special place tucked away in my little heart, however, this location is now outcast , like a bastard child.  The menu has since been stripped to bits, no longer offering my favourite salads, or their ingredients.  The quality has plummeted, and the prices of toppings has increased past the number of six on a custom salad.  Not ok.     I came in here today to see if these matters had been corrected, but, no.  And, so, I left.  The solution?  A visit to Panera Bread, where I am enjoying a hearty salad, and updating my yelp review."}
{"text":"Out of all their branches, this surprised me and quickly became my favourite. Ask for their curry sauce which is not advertised or on the menu!"}
{"text":"I went there on July 7, 2009 for lunch, with friends because they felt like eating something healthy.  I ordered the Bangkok Burrito because I didn't want to take too long deciding on building a custom meal, but I'd love to try it out sometime. Anyhow, my Bangkok Burrito was ready relatively quickly, used fresh ingredients and was delicious. At the same time, the staff were all very friendly and courteous.  The downside? The price. Without anything extra, my meal came up to $7.86 and it wasn't very filling. Although, I don't really mind paying the premium because of the fresh ingredients and healthy meals.  Would definitely go back again, but it seems like more of a treat for now!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! The young woman serving my family went above and beyond to accommodate us! Food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Quick, easy, healthy and always fresh! Staff is always super friendly.   This is the perfect place to hit up after the gym or for a dinner on the run.   Market salad and Buddha satay bowl are my favs!    thumbs up!"}
{"text":"the veggies are NOT fresh. They are just as bad as subway. The rice noodles in the soup are not cooked enough. The spicy lemon grass is nothing but water with lemon. If there are expensive topping like avocado,  they \"forget\" it. Then they'll say they will add it for \"free\" next time you order food. If you order rice noodle soup, they will fill most of the soup with cheap Chinese rice-noodles and put very little toppings. This really sucks."}
{"text":"Love this downtown lunch spot! The service was amazing and the young gentleman helped me so much and was very happy to be at work. He even remembered some regulars first name. Great customer service! The food was also delicious with great salads and burritos. There is also a really neat coffee shop inside too!"}
{"text":"The few times I have been to Freshii I have ordered salads off their menu and never utilized their clip board pick-your-own-items system so this review is based solely on their ready made salads. I usually order two specific salads at this location: BBQ chicken salad and the Freshii cobb salad. Both salads (very tasty by the way) have a fairly decent amount of avocado but I find sometimes the chicken portion can be scarce. The size of the salads are quite filling meals but again, it would be nice to add a little bit more pieces of chicken.   Customer service was good. The employees were friendly and the lines moved quickly. I've only had one negative experience at this place and that was when I ordered a BBQ chicken salad and it was missing the BBQ chicken and avocado which was a bit of a  disappointment considering I paid $10 for it. I did send an e-mail to customer service to let them know what happened and they were super helpful and offered me a free meal to make up for the poor experience.  Their debit machines are not chip friendly and hopefully they will upgrade to the newer machines soon. Sometimes I've experienced difficulty paying with my convenience card since their machines don't always read the strip on my debit card - which isn't really a complaint but rather an inconvenience. So be mindful of that when you pay for your meals (ie. you might want to bring cash if you have issues with your debit card strip).   Although their debit machines may be out of date, Freshii has impressed me with their website and app! Their website is pretty user friendly and offers a handy, easily available nutritional information guide and I also think their app is pretty cool since you can use it to pay for your meals which is convenient since you can just load up your account and pay from the balance by holding your phone up to the scanner at the register.  Overall, the salads at freshii are fresh, tasty, and filling but they could be consistent and add a little bit more protein to the meals (when ordered of course). It is quite pricey for a salad but I think that is the standard among other salad restaurants these days. Definitely a good option if you are in the area and looking for something healthy to eat...and also if you are willing to spend the money."}
{"text":"First time at this location but I was happy to see it was bright, spacious and clean. I got the metaboost salad with falafel which tasted good but I probably wouldn't mix the two again.   I'd come here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Freshii gives people something quick to take away or sit in and chat in a quiet place. You can choose a customized bowl or one of their bowls."}
{"text":"Love freshii.  The Liberty Village location is just getting established, but already I find myself there a few times/week.  So happy to have one in my work 'hood."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Freshii today, I'm hooked.  Ingredients were fresh (as the name suggests), toppings plentiful, veggie broth and spicy broth are both very good tasting.  I'm definitely going back and soon!  Best part is there's one opened in Liberty Village (near work and home). Danger!Danger! :P"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, if a bit expensive. Employees were awful. Worst part was that I found 2 dead ladybugs in my salad wrap?? Nearly ate them bc they were embedded in the cheese. Crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is stingy. I ordered a Fiesta salad and it was really lacking. There was a single small piece of avocado in it and barely any cheese. I paid $9 for a salad that was basically all greens.   To make it worse the employees are rude and obnoxious. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this place again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but sadly, a big disappointment.  Atmosphere had the warmth of a warehouse cafeteria.  Freshii is a misnomer as my salad greens were bruised & wilted; dried out produce - ugh!  I was told the burrito was ok.  Crossing this place off my list.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced but good reliable vegetarian options that don't feel like anything is missing. My favorite is the Pangoa bowl with tofu."}
{"text":"Not clean at all. Bad customer service! I ordered a freshii green smoothie and asked them to cut the frozen yogurt in half. Well they totally ignored me and on top of everything the girl who served me drop my cup on the dirty floor, picked it up and instead of throwing it out and pick a new one, continued to make the smoothie in that cup. I got so mad and asked someone else to change the cup.  Also, she didn't changed her gloves after cleaning the floor. I don't think these people are allowed to serve customers. They have no idea about the basic hygiene.  Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got the chance to try this place!! Healthy, fresh and fast!! Oooh and tasty!! Way to hit the nail on the head guys!!  Thank you for doing what you do AND changing your hours to be open later!!!  I now have somewhere close by that I can go to and stay healthy!!! YOU GUYS ROCK"}
{"text":"Don't eat here!  They are located in Terminal 3 by gates 18-20. They have a large menu board so lots of choices but I am here at 5:30 and looking for breakfast. Service is less than par as there was a long line and the two people working were chit chatting, looking at us. No sense of taking orders and no sense of efficiency.  Got a wrap with egg Bacon panini style. It was not warn, not crisp, just oily goo. Threw it away. So go to Urban Crave, it's the lesser of 2 evils.  For a few dollars more you sit down for a nice cup of coffee. But it's not great either.   Maybe it's what I ordered but they do offer a nice variety of health bars and drinks. They offer smoothies so that might have been a better choice.  Maybe it's better to eat breakfast before you go to the airport if you are flying out of Terminal 3 near gates 16-21. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A great healthy option for the downtown crowd!  I love going to Freshii for delicious salads, wrap and rice bowls.  My faves are the Cobb and Market wraps/salads.  The service is relatively quick despite long lines around the lunch hour.  Wish List:  I wish that they had a gluten-free wrap option.  A Mediterranean wrap/salad would be nice on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh wraps, salads, and smoothies.  I get the Kung Fu Bowl of the kids menu if i am looking for a small bowl.  If you looking for something big Fiest wrap will hit the spot.  Amazing customer service and cucumber water galore.  Great selection of sparkling water.   Check it out next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. We asked front desk at our hotel for a place to eat, preferably with vegetarian options, and they recommended Freshii to us. They said it was fresh and fast.  It was walking distance from our hotel, so decided to check it out. When we walked in, the people behind the counter where just having their own conversations.  I didn't mind because I didn't know what I wanted, and needed time to look at the menu. I had the Marché Wrap with the Énergie Rouge juice, and my husband had the Tex Mex Burrito.  The juice was already made fresh that morning, I was told.  The juice was good, but didn't care much for my wrap.  It was dry without flavor.  I get veggie wraps all the time, and this was the worst one I've had so far.  My husband like his burrito, and seemed to enjoy it.  Unfortunately, I don't this I would visit them again."}
{"text":"My first time at Freshii felt like I got dropped into the middle of a salsa club's dance floor and expected to know how to dance. Except the dance floor was the size of a postage stamp, and my body had been replaced with that of a hippopotamus. However, once I got over the initial shock of a) what the frack I was supposed to do to get any food around there, and b) the exorbitant pricel, the experience wasn't so bad.   I enjoyed my Turkey Cobb wrap immensely; it's probably not that healthy (considering I subbed ranch dressing for the honey dijon) but I got the illusion of it being so (given the fresh vegetables, turkey, and whole wheat tortilla) -- but I'm cool with that. (And maybe there's a Tooth Fairy.)  Also, no Coke? Really? Just Coke Zero and Diet Coke? Those aren't so great for you either! Help a soda-loving sister out and offer at least Mexican Coke, please!"}
{"text":"Not only are you able to get a light, healthful lunch here, but your pocketbook will also be quite a bit lighter after you leave. My spinach salad (with addition of chicken and a sprinkling of cheese) and snack-sized bag of pita chips came out to nearly $13. That's quite spendy for your typical weekday lunch, especially considering the toppings on the salad were quite skimpy. By way of comparison, I get essentially the same salad nearly every day in the Toronto General Hospital food court for under $10. To add insult to injury, my Freshii salad came drowning in dressing. I guess I'll just stick to TGH for salad, and head over to Freshii when I'm in the mood for a wrap (and have some extra cash burning a hole in my wallet)."}
{"text":"I've had freshii's twice now for catered events.  The first time, I was bowed over by the fresh tasting and great flavour combinations of their wraps. I had a chicken club wrap, part of the deluxe catering box combo. As sides, we had warrior chicken and teriyaki vegetable. I loved the warrior chicken!! It had a creamy tang to it, I could of eaten the whole container. The food itself came nicely packaged in white chinese-takeout style small boxes.   I was looking up the price of the deluxe box online, its $90 for 12 wraps cut in half, so potentially enough to feed 24 people (or $37.5 per half wrap) ends up being an affordable catering option.  The second time I had freshii's..it wasn't as exciting. I'm not sure if it was catered from a different location (there are multiple all over Toronto) but the flavours weren't as tasty. As well, I ended up with a vegan wrap, which was...very average. It was a combo of lettuce/sundried tomatoes/broccoli and a dressing with a sweet tangy flavour. But it wasn't enough dressing and all the tomatoes were towards the bottom of the wrap-basically I felt like I was eating a very bland lettuce filled wrap. We had similar salad selections as the first time, but I was not won over by the warrior chicken, it was average. I also noticed a couple of the wraps had the same warrior chicken filling! Not terribly creative.  I wish I could tell you which location we ordered from! But I've learned for myself, that food preparation, even in franchised operations, can differ from place to place.  My bottom line is that I would recommend freshiis for catered venues. Its a healthy option, and overall a crowd pleaser at both the events I attended."}
{"text":"Wow!  This was a great find.  The food is fresh and very tasty.  Nice veggie option.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Gourmet salad... pretty straightforward... lots of veggies, maybe some grains, cheese, or meat.  The same price as a full meal at some other fast food places, Freshii assembles your salad when you order.  There are a pre-set choices for salads, bowls and wraps all with the option to take out something you don't like or pay a bit more for something you want to add.  It's been a while since I went as I don't work in the area anymore but when IQ Foods opened up across from them, they lost business and had to introduce a weekly $5 menu.  I'm not positive they still do the $5 deals but it was good enough for me to choose them over the competition..."}
{"text":"My biggest issue with lettuce is the size of their portions. Even if all you eat for a meal is a salad - these things are HUGE and there's no way they can be the recommended portion size. I don't really mind that they're so big, but they should offer a smaller size for people who don't want to eat 1000 pounds of lettuce for lunch.   I must say though, Lettuce is efficient. You can write your order down on a piece of paper and give it to the salad artists and they will whip it up nice and fast. They have tons of fresh toppings like veggies, dried fruit, meats and cheeses. Every time I've been there, the salads have been good, but it just bothers me that I have to spend like $9 on a salad that I can't even finish.  That being said, they are pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Their bowls and wraps are good. But their Salads are BORING and they are very cheap on the toppings.  Its pretty much just lettuce and dressing. Way too overpriced"}
{"text":"First time eating at Freshii but it will definitely not be the last!  I had the Mediterranean salad with chicken and it was fabulous!  I am so glad that there are more healthy options in the fast food arena!"}
{"text":"Totally digging Freshii!! I've been twice this week already! The tortilla soup is great, and it's a huge portion size for $8. It made two lunches for me.  The kale in it really sets it apart from any other tortilla soup I've had. Oh, and thank you for not charging extra for avocado! Yesterday I got a detox juice with my soup, so today I went back to try the revive juice to go with my leftovers. Both juices are delicious and it's really convenient and quick to be able to grab them and go. Price wise, maybe a tad more expensive than other places around, but I'm willing to pay for fresh, clean, and delicious food. Looking forward to trying all that Freshii has to offer!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  $9 for a Tuna wrap which was enormous - but 80% of it was shredded lettuce. Tuna, feta and other ingredients almost impossible to detect."}
{"text":"Am surprised but not THAT surprised to see that Freshii's been getting some sub-par reviews.  I read about the founder in a Globe & Mail article and was impressed and couldn't wait to try this place. My first one was the Bangkok Chicken burrito. $6.95, not bad...I was going to opt for the veggie since I'm not that big on meat but dammit, the veggie burrito cost the same if not more (definitely not less than), so I went ahead and ordered the Bangkok Chicken requesting \"more vegetables than brown rice\".  It came grilled which I was impressed with. Then I ate it. Then I realized that there was A TON of brown rice and not enough veggies. Then I thought to myself, next time I'll just go to Booster Juice (which is literally 15 steps away) and spend $6.95 and be happy about it.  Then a week later I went back to Freshii to give its Veggie Wrap a chance. It was about $7.95. Expensive, and my mind wandered over to Booster Juice again but I stuck to my guns. I even asked for tofu (an extra $1.50). The wrap arrived, I paid $9.52 for this thing.   I ate it. I was incredibly unimpressed and felt extremely ripped off. There were veggies, a pinch-ful of chick peas, sun-dried tomatoes...my tofu. It was dry, no balsamic dressing like the menu said. It was gross-dry. Basically, it was all those things wrapped in a tortilla.   Honestly, I could've just gone to Metro next door and spent $9.52 for a week's worth of this wrap. I could've spent $1 more and gone to Booster Juice for a Regular Drink Combo plus grilled sandwich.  The good thing about this place is that I bitched on Twitter and they responded right away. I still have to email them about my experience before they decide to do anything about it."}
{"text":"Portions are as usual. Clean location and very friendly staff! I usually order the Mediterranean Bowl and substitute the olives for avocados :) Delicious"}
{"text":"This place is like a separate food stand (with no seating) within the path that connects the Hudson's Bay and the Sheraton Hotel.  They have a $5 special everyday (with select menu items for $1-2 less), but added meat costs extra. The portions for their meals are expectedly average, and their smoothies are rejuvenating but are rather small for $6. Freshii is good for a quick healthy bite without paying too much. The spicy lemongrass soup is a must-try and is $5 on Fridays!"}
{"text":"I had a Pangoa bowl and a Green smoothie and omg I fell in love with it! I love the service in this location better. The staff were very friendly, fast, and accommodating to my preferences. This is a good place to have a quick bite for those on the go! Fast , fresh and healthy! My new go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years.  I don't remember liking it but was getting bored of the other options around here, so I decided to make a visit.  Feeling hungry, I went for the tex-mex burrito.  It was gross.  So, so gross.  I don't think it's Freshii's fault per se.  The ingredients seemed fresh, though the chicken was weird in texture, but overall, it just tasted gross."}
{"text":"Get here at least an hour before closing. They were out of a lot of items, black beans were mush and the juice machine was broken down already. Not my best visit to Freshii"}
{"text":"My roommate and I have discussed since two summers ago how much we wished Madison had a chopped salad place. Completely randomly after dropping in at wells Fargo, ran into this place! Wish granted!!! They have some really excellent healthy options. Got the superbiotic with added kale and avocado, and it was pretty darn delicious! Salad places can often get in trouble from oversaucing, but they didn't have this problem at all. I almost wish there was more! Though I will definitely come back, a couple complaints.. 1) my salad had something super weirdly crunchy to the point of me wondering if they left grit in there by accident. It was only a couple bites though. 2) the decor is pretty meh and industrial. From outside it looks like a yogurt shop and from the inside there is just way too much empty space. I wouldn't want to sit and eat my salad! 3) it's far from downtown.  All in all though, good food! Pro tip: get one of the metal reusable bowls (I think it's $5.) to feed hungry children and get a discount when you use it!"}
{"text":"Yum!  What a great addition to the Piedmont shopping area!  And a healthy one!!  Offering wraps, salads , brown rice bowls and delicious smoothies!  I had the southwest bowl that boasted kale, black beans avocado brown rice and a protein of your choice.  I opted for tofu.  The bowl also came with a not so spicy dressing that was tasty.  My only gripe about the delicious bowl if I had to say anything is that I wished it had more kale than the few pieces that were in it.... it was mostly rice but tasty all the same.  Next time I might even try it without rice. The space is very bright and you can watch some of the food preparation from the limited seating inside but the decor is simple and fresh, like their ingredients.... which is a good thing!  I look forward to returning to try some of the other offerings but nice to have another healthy option in this area!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy there is finally a place to get fast healthy food! Freshii is reasonably priced with lots of options and tasty food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Trying to be a healthier version of chipotle I guess. But the flavored were way too overpowering. You can't have a good meal of you can barely taste the food because of the sauce.. Not too \"freshii\" with all that sauce. And the chicken tastes like shredded can chicken or something lol why is it so soft and not chicken like!"}
{"text":"First timer, NOT the last timer. I wasn't expecting much but I thank the location in Charlotte for setting me straight. You know that meal when you get exactly what you want but it's even better? THIS was me. I ordered the Bamboo bowl and it was truly fantastic. Brown rice, fresh veggies with the right amount of crunch, mushrooms, cilantro, lime and green curry sauce. This couldn't have hit the spot any better if it was with a bow and arrow. I am SUPER happy that I loved my meal, very affordable and I plan on visiting the Raleigh location very soon."}
{"text":"I loved this Freshii location when it first opened and would come at least once a week for a yummy bowl. In the last couple months I have had issues with food consistency and customer service. I still think it's great to have a healthy option in the Beaches and their customization options are good (dressings/sauces, added proteins etc). I don't plan on returning anytime soon though, as much as I want to support the business."}
{"text":"The best Freschi location I have ever been to. It is clean they are not cheap in terms of portion and they have very good customer service I do plan on returning here as soon as possible"}
{"text":"OK, I tried the wrap and WHAT A WASTE!  Seriously, I got the tuna wrap and they literally must have shredded the tuna into tiny little pieces and then put a thimbleful of it into a giant stack of lettuce and wrapped that in a dry piece of cardboard and rolled it up. That's how bad the wrap was. I had to unwrap it and eat it with a fork and it was bland and bad. Don't get a wrap here. Stick with the salad."}
{"text":"A healthy food ? Nutritious and still delicious ???? Will all those ever work together ?  I was having all these questions before I tried this new place at southland crossing. Now that I have an answer with a big 'YES' .  It was just super delicious and yet nutritious. I got to taste teriyaki twist bowl and smoke house burrito.  Looking at all the ingredients in the bowl just made me understand why they meant nutritious. The bowl consisted of brown rice, edamame and few others with teriyaki sauce made it taste so right.  And all of this for a reasonable price, that was what the interesting part which would want me to try again. I brought burrito home and reheated before eating. I felt I could have eaten fresh at the store rather than taking it home. However, there was no compromise on the taste. It tasted so right with the inside fillings despite of tasting after 1 hour.  Next time looking forward to trying it fresh at the store.   The best part to know was that the bowl they use to serve are made of corn starch which are recyclable. Appreciate their concern towards environment."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and nearly always 100% impressed. Sometimes there is not enough dressing and their lines are not organized, but I love their food and it's as tasty and fresh as you can get in Toronto. I wholly recommend this place to anyone who is trying to eat healthy, or just wants a delicious lunch. I wish they were open later because you could definitely eat there for dinner.   Wish I could give it a 4.5/5, but since it's not perfect i have to say 4/5. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0, I would. It is been the third times today that I give them a chance and they are still incompetent and inefficient. I like Freshii and every other Freshii locations, but the Eaton Center is mediocre.  Three days in a row that I come spend my money for my daily lunch, 3 times that I have no sauce or seasoning in the salad, this is dry as hell. And they are too lazy to cut the salad leaves, so we all go with giant salad... they even forgot the apple in the market salad ? how possible, that is the base of it. The team before renovation was great, fast and polite. Advice ? Hire new staff or adjust your price, because today my salad isn't worth more than 3$ again"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it so much! I got the Southwest burrito and it was sooo tasty, even without the cheese (I'm a vegan). They were quick and friendly, and I felt great after eating my meal."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the teriyaki twist with tofu bowl! I've never been into the restaurant, I order through FoodsBy at work and have not had a bad experience yet. I hope to get in to the restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered two things for delivery. Both ordered were wrong. Including the extra chicken I ordered and paid for. I called up, they're refusing to do anything. Bad service, slow delivery, incomplete orders, manager refusing to help. Just order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location is a well kept franchise that is fast, efficient and delicious. You can pretty much customize what it is that you're eating, but their set menu items are quite good.  I ordered a Teriyaki Twist bowl which comes with brown rice, broccoli, carrots, edamame, cucumber, green onions, sesame seeds, crispy wontons, teriyaki sauce. I added chicken breast for an additional cost. You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and made to order. Although the price can be steep depending on what you add, they do have daily specials on different days of the week. Besides, it's Downtown, Toronto.. you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. It's bright, clean and the staff is helpful but I went here for lunch the other day with a co-worker, ordered different salads and by mid-afternoon, neither of us were feeling too well.  I opted for the Superbiotic with chicken and she created her own concoction. The ingredients in the Superbiotic sounded fantastic but unfortunately, the 'toppings to lettuce ratio' is off and it rendered the salad somewhat bland. Half the amount of lettuce would have been better.  Freshii's is extremely over-priced and for a salad and a pop, my lunch came to $13. I could have gotten way more for way less elsewhere. If I do give them another shot, it may be for a soup but I doubt I would have a salad again.   It's a shame. I had great hopes for this place. A 2.5 star at best."}
{"text":"The food was fairly good but missed the brown rice from what it said on the menu. The old stuff a lady was proficient and quick a new lady was so slow and took my order for more than 5 minutes, told me wrong information and did not understand, remember names on the menu. Definitely, need more training before going for serve. The bowl originally came with no protein, but she told me I could select any one of those. But in fact, the total price for add a little chicken and steak would be $5.48 before tax which was a bit pricey. Still, consider Chipotle has better value and Mexican style(even not that \"real\" as some great restaurant.)  For this meal below I paid $22.12."}
{"text":"I have originally sent it on the date of the incident Friday January 26, 2018.  I will continue to send emails and escalate until I have been given a response.  What happened on Friday was unacceptable and I still feel disgusted about it.  I went to the scotia plaza location to order a spicy lemongrass soup.  I have previously ordered this from the Eaton Center location numerous times, with no issues.  Friday when I got this soup from the scotia plaza location.  It was NOTHING like previously and how it is supposed to be.  It tasted nothing like lemongrass,  was not spicy and had CHICKEN bits floating in it.   To remind you, the menu states: spicy lemongrass broth, rice noodles, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, mushrooms, cilantro  LEMON GRASS BROTH.  Not chicken, LEMONGRASS.   I immediately took this soup back to the scotia plaza location and told them this had chicken floating in it.  The woman working insisted that is how it is made, with chicken broth.  I said no, that is not what it says.  She insisted they make it with chicken broth.   As a vegetarian, this is unacceptable, to take a CLEARLY vegetarian item on the MENU, that says in plain English that it is made with LEMONGRASS BROTH - to try to convince me that you actually make it with chicken broth?  Where is the decency in that?    I got my money back and will never ever step foot near another freshii ever again, but that is not the point.  I want to know that this person at scotia plaza will be made aware that this is going to be escalated, that location is either being lazy and taking shortcuts with their menu items or have not been told by someone above them that they are GROSSLY misleading a large section of people.  I am disgusted."}
{"text":"This \"healthy\" food chain has gone downhill in quality in the last couple of years. Toppings are sparse, frequently they are out of stuff too. Froyo is tasty though. Many more healthy quick stop restaurants have my vote!"}
{"text":"Great concept.  Good execution.  Food was 4 star.  Service was 2 star.  I got the sense they are still learning how to efficiently operate - which I think contributes to the bad reviews.  I'm giving 4 stars in hopes the process smooths out.    I had the wrangler bowl with chicken.  That's brown rice, corn, black beans, tomatoes, cabbage...it was awesome.  Value is great.  Quality was great.  Good portion.  Good flavor."}
{"text":"Good food and decent service. The frozen yogurt was absolutely delicious. I recommend getting the cinnamon and honey. I got a Pangoa bowl, which was a little bland unfortunately. But overall it was very good."}
{"text":"Messed up my order twice, and lost my delivery address. By the time my food arrived my smoothie was warm. Orders take close to 15-20 minutes just to prepare and then wait slow delivery. Waited well over an hour to receive my meal. Food is very pricey in my opinion, even for a \"healthy\" meal."}
{"text":"With the arrival of Freshii, I was finally able to expand my lunch horizon in Downtown.  Located on Grant, the place screams healthy as you walk in.  There's plenty of seats at the back of the house.  You can pick up juice, order salad, or do what I do and get their noodle soup!  Their Thai-inspired soup with lemongrass is lunch portion.  I was expecting a small side order portion at first.  It was filling and delicious!!!  I always welcome a new lunch addition with noodle option here."}
{"text":"Woo-hoo! I no longer have to travel far for a delicious salad. Open for only a week, this eatery is similar to it's sister branch on McCowan & the 401: cute place, fast service, flavorful food at reasonable prices.  They serve salads, wraps, bowls, burritos, soups, juices and smoothies. You can add their hormone free chicken, steak, tofu or falafel (for an upcharge) to any of the entrees, and you can switch out the brown rice base for Kale or quinoa (again for an upcharge). They also offer a 1-3-5 day juice cleanse.  Bonus: they post the calorie count for their menu items so you can make an informed choice. Keep an eye out for the \"We Feed\" icon next to some menu items and part of your purchase will go to charity.   Hubby and I have tried and loved the following: Banana Crunch Smoothie, Spicy Lemongrass Soup (better than some Thai restaurants I know), Pangoa Bowl, Fiesta Salad, Metaboost Salad and the Smokehouse Burrito. Don't forget to grab a package of yummy Energii Bites (peanut butter, honey, oats, coconut and chocolate chips) for the road."}
{"text":"You shouldn't have to give up flavor to eat healthy.    Hubby and I were in the mood for a salad; we ended up at Freshii after a quick Yelp search. It's in the Plaza with World Gym and National Sports, next to Starbucks, right by the freeway entrance/exit. Bright, clean place with friendly and efficient staff; line ups move quick.  WE ORDERED:  Metaboost Chicken salad - spinach, kale & field greens, goat cheese, mango, almonds, carrots, edamame, balsamic vinaigrette.   Smokehouse Burrito with chicken - they were out of brown rice, we didn't want quinoa, so we ended up getting spinach as a filler. This was delicious, especially with the mild sauce that left a nice tingle on my tongue.  Power balls - chocolate chips, oats, coconut flakes and peanut butter. Packed with flavor, it had a satisfying chew and was surprisingly filling. Look for these in the refrigerated section.  Would definitely return to try their breakfast, poke salads, and wraps."}
{"text":"After receiving poor service at Jamba Juice a few doors down, I really wanted to try this place. I went in on a whim one afternoon and LOVED it. The atmosphere was so inviting and on theme. The employees were very friendly, service was quick, line was organized, and my smoothie was delicious. If I weren't a college student, I would so come here more often and try everything (lack of funds). I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see that Freshii's first Wisconsin location would be on the west side of Madison. They serve great, high-quality, nutritious food which caters to all diets. They have a clearly labelled menu which lists vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free menu items.   The concept is similar to Chipotle in that you can build any combination of wrap/salad/burrito/bowl using a menu of ingredients. Pick a protein, a grain, toppings and sauce. There are tons of great options and everything I've tried has been really delicious.   Prices are reasonable and there is enough variety to keep me coming back many more times. Try this place out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not a very great first time experience here at all. Hoping to try it out before a movie, I purchased a $15 restaurant.com certificate as I often do for restaurants that participate in the program. It's great, because I try a lot of places I wouldn't normally check out. I purchased over $30 of food and beverages and presented my phone with the certificate open for redemption. Some 20 year old behind the counter intervened and informed me that the company only accepts the vouchers when the are physically printed on paper. How ironic that this 20 year old was bringing us back to the 90s! Who has a printer anymore, and why would that idiotic and unfair (and probably violative of the terms of service with restaurant.com) policy even exist in 2017?? I even asked if they had a wireless printer so I could direct-connect to it with my phone and print it out, but of course, the backwards millennial informed me that they did not. How convenient! I won't be going there ever again, thanks to the incredible incompetency and inflexibility (and, again, probably breach of contract) of the management. Listen, I work in customer service too, and if I were the 20 year old with giant gauges in my ears and a huge amount of apathy and disregard for the people that came to my store, I would have given the customer the freaking $15 off, because who the hell cares about $15? Instead, my holy-lobed friend behind the counter offered me 10% off my order, about $3, which was \"all he was allowed to do\" likely because some other 20-something manager named Brad or Nick or something equally awful was \"cracking down on those things.\" Cracking down on honoring a coupon? Jesus, how hard up are you people?  Also, and quite unrelated, the food was really bland and not very warm. I would have considered coming again, since there aren't many vegetarian restaurants in madison to choose from, but that millennial vaped that bridge to the ground."}
{"text":"So I came here today to get my regular freshi. The person working totally ruined my mood. He was very disrespectful. Apparently my money wasn't worth anything to him because it was slightly ripped. He then continued to disrespect me and have no manners to when it came to the rest of my meal.  Ruined my meal and night.   Also when I asked for tape to fix my 20$  He said theirs no tape. (Meanwhile there was tape RIGHT BEHIND HIM)    Then when I asked for his name so I could let his manager know  He scribbled this... This was his name    Terrible service tonight"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a very clean lean healthy breakfast/lunch/smoothie/juice/soup, then this is the place to go. You will get a good portion of food for a price comparable to what you will pay at other nearby lunch spots.   Yes, the wait will be long during the lunch rush, but the staff are trying their best to get it going. And despite the stress and noise in such a small space, the guy who finally bags my lunch looks me in the eye, smiles, asks if I need anything extra, hands me my food, and thanks me for visiting. That made all the difference from being annoyed for the wait and then feeling appreciated for putting up with it.  Plus, their broth soups are delicious and served in a very large container. You can save half for later or lunch the next day.  This will be my go to place when I don't have leftovers to bring to work. No more worries about sabotaging my clean eating anymore."}
{"text":"i went to the location on st. clair for lunch. the place is marketed as 'green'. the ktichen is very open, and you watch the food being made as you stand in line. i'm sorry, \"green\"? everything was served in to-go containers, even the food for people staying. maybe you can request to-stay containers, but i wasnt asked and received everything in disposable packaging, including plates and cutlery. but what i found really suprising was the way the meals were made. for any given dish, everything was thrown into a *plastic bag*, mixed around, and THEN dumped into its disposable container. i watched the cooks throw out bag after bag."}
{"text":"The main benefit of this chain is that they offer some healthier options for the health conscious consumer. Lot's of raw and lean ingredients make for a balanced meal. Problem is, I find the menu lacks creativity of ingredients and with all of the locations I've been to the dishes are bland. They also do a horrible job in cooking their rice."}
{"text":"I got the superfood soup and all the vegetables go into your container raw and then hot broth is poured over.. the veggies are still very crunchy. That's not the reason for the bad review though. The kale in my soup was spotty and browning along the edges.. it clearly looks terrible and old. It shouldn't have been served"}
{"text":"3 of us came here for lunch. The market salad and Meta boost salad is not bad. Good portion. The 3rd dish was the Steak and Cheddar bowl chilli which was cold!!   The cheese wasn't  melting and the centre of the bowl was literally cold.   We asked the staff nicely to just warm it up but he have us so much negative attitude and argues that it is warm. We made him touch the bowl and explained we just want it microwaved or something ..as chill shoul be hot.   Very reluctantly he did it.   I do not recommend this location, not b/c of the food but due to the pot service"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch 3 days a week and have been doing so for about 7 months.  Service - fast and efficient!  Food - I found that the ingredients are tasty and fresh with the exception of the chicken (hence the 3 stars).  The chicken is over processed and tastes more like salted rubber than chicken.  It is sad that a place that calls itself \"freshii\" uses over processed chicken.  Use grilled chicken!!  Price - in line with the food with the exception of the processed chicken.  Avoid the processed chicken and you will love this place!"}
{"text":"I was walking to Qdoba when I passed Freshii and it caught my eye. I could tell that it looked like a healthy option for quick food. There were several bowl options and all looked delicious, I had a hard time choosing. Per the cashiers recommendation I got the teriyaki twist bowl with chicken. It was sooo good! Everything tasted fresh and the chicken was better quality than I've had at other quick food places (like chipotle). They also have a variety of fresh juices and smoothies to choose from. The only sad thing is they close at 5pm so be aware of that! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$12.41 for the Market salad... $12.41. It's not even that big.  Plus it was slightly edible, not good. The amount of chicken was MINUSCULE. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the Buddha Satay bowl.  I wasn't paying too much attention to the menu, but when I started to eat, I realized it was a rice noodle bowl.  That's unique.  It was quite tasty, and I believe there was an option to upgrade to quinoa or kale for $1.99.  In the land of suburbia, it's nice to know that there's a healthy option.  I would dine here again if I were in the area.    There's several choices that looked really appetizing.  The burritos and wraps seemed to be a crowd favourite."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions (as in my smoothie looked like a kids cup) and not worth eating \"healthy\" here. My Cobb wrap had so much dressing in it I couldn't even finish it. I paid $17 for a small smoothie and a wrap with chicken, no sides. You can eat healthier and from local farmers at many of the cafes on Willy St."}
{"text":"Freshii has become my latest obsession! With this Bay Street location 3 minutes away from my work by foot, it is great because I have access to so many healthy choices and at a reasonable cost.  Ten years ago, you wouldn't be able to find such exciting \"slimming\" choices when it came to fast food. Now with such a place like Freshii, I can always depend on their delicious salads, wraps, burritos and bowls.  For the salads, wraps, burritos and bowls, all customers have the option of building their own meal or ordering one of the chef's choices (pre-made with a good combination of ingredients).  For the \"build your own\" meal, you have a HUGE list of toppings, flavours and sauces/dressings to choose for.  For example, if you are going to build your own salad, you have 20 choices of unlimited toppings (all veggies and eggs) and close to 30 premium toppings (meat, cheeses and seasonal fruit).  Then you top it off with your favourite dressing! How amazing is that?  And if you build your own meal, you can easily look up the nutritional value online or ask one of your servers about the cal/fat count.   If you are going to go with a chef's choice, I would recommend the following (which I tasted myself!):  - Cajun Chicken Salad ($8.45) - Asian Chop Salad ($7.95) - Turkey Cobb Wrap ($7.65) - Vegan Wrap ($6.95) - Teriyaki Burrito ($6.95) - Warrior Chicken Bowl ($7.50) - Salmon Bowl ($9.75)  I know what some of you are thinking....it is a little more pricey than your average McDonalds burger, but it is super healthy.  For anyone looking for a healthy fast food choice or are trying to stick to your New Year's resolution of eating better, Freshii is a great place to start!"}
{"text":"The food was alright but the service was horrible. I grabbed breakfast before my flight and everyone working there had the worst attitude ever. They had no smile and they looked grumpy. You will realize when you go."}
{"text":"Really good option. Very tasty for airport food. Wish there was more room in the seating area  Buddha Satay was good. Loaded with noodles and peanut sauce had just enough heat.  The workers however, looked miserable and pressured"}
{"text":"When I went to this location to order food.I was refused service because they decided to close 10 minutes early. When I walked into the store the franchise owner was very rude to me. saying \"What are you doing?!?!? Cant you see the sign we are closed.\" I said to the owner \"I didn't look at the sign because the door is wide open so I assumed you were still open, if you are closed you should close the door, or block the entrance if you want to keep the door open. Then people won't walk in by accident, and you do not need to get mad.\" The owner started to swear at me dropping f-bombs, and telling me to \"shut my face\", \"shut my stupid face\", \"fucking close the door then\". I do have a video of this event and am unsure if Yelp will allow me to post it.  Upset I went home and placed a complaint on Freshii's website, so the company can know what kind of people are representing their brand. I had the same man who yelled at me iin the store call me on my phone and start yelling at me on the phone saying things like. \"you stupid women.\" \"I can't get in trouble I own the place.\" I ended up hanging up the phone in the middle of the conversation as this man was unbearably mean, and rude.  I did not end up getting any food. I was treated very poorly in the store and on my personal phone. I would not recommend this place to anyone as no prospect customer deserves to be treated this way. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.  -------------------- As an update the franchise reached out to me and it took them over 4 months to get back to my complain with a pathetic apology."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki bowl with chicken and it was soooooo gross. For some reason, the bowl was incredibly wet- it looked like they just poured some cold water in it. The veggies were cold, which I assumed they just put the salad topping veggies in it. When I get a bowl I don't expect it to come with cold steamed veggies. The chicken itself was not good and the teriyaki sauce tasted like some type of frozen lean cuisine sauce. Do not go here, literally go anywhere else if you love yourself."}
{"text":"Oaxaca bowl is the best, and I highly recommend adding steak. My second go-to is the bamboo bowl with chicken.  My friend said the Cobb burrito has great sauce as well.   Their foods taste healthy but not bland because of their sauces. 1 star off because it is pricey. For the same price of around $15 you can get a huge box of takeout elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh.. healthy... Alot of different drinks... Place is very clean and leaves you feeling good.  Great for athletes or clean eaters."}
{"text":"Wow!  Fresh, clean, tasty, healthy and reasonably priced!  What else do you want?  Oh, yea...super friendly staff!  I love it!   We went for lunch and had Cobb Salad and Budda's Satay. Both were great!"}
{"text":"Try the tangy frozen yogurt! Choose up to 2 fresh (not defrosted or frozen so they taste luscious) fruit toppings at no extra charge. We love the mango and strawberry. Also yummy with cinnamon and strawberry.   Have purchased a few of the themed wraps and rice dishes.  All have been really good.  We tried to eat in one time, but it's a bit small for it, so I stick to takeout.  The owner/manager (who I don't otherwise know) is a great guy, too."}
{"text":"I love this chain, but was not impressed with the service here.  I ordered a frozen yogurt with fresh fruit in an empty store.  However, I had to wait until 2 people after me ordered and got their food before I got mine.  Only 1 guy working the cash and food area while a girl with a separate cash register and coffee products sat and watched.  The yogurt was delicious, which is why it's getting the stars."}
{"text":"Truly one of kind dining in Madison!  Everything just tastes great -- and it's good for you!  You walk out feeling like you spent your money on something you really wanted to eat -- and can't wait to take a friend there next time!  And the cost is very easy on the wallet!  Action Jack Magee, Freshii's owner, has done a wonderful job bringing this great restaurant to Madison!  Way to go, Jack!  And thank you!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of healthy fast food. Obviously it is miles more expensive than the McDonalds value menu. But does McD's have avocados. No. The best I had here was the Oaxaca bowl. IT IS AMAZING! The spicy yogurt sauce tastes just like BBQ sauce and my bowl was filled to the top! Service was super friendly too (restaurant was kind of empty at the time, so we made some friendly conversation).   I've also had the teriyaki bowl, which I found to be very bland and unexciting. Honestly something I could've made myself. The portion was also a lot smaller (different server).   I also had a burrito a long time ago and I remember it being good but not craving it like I do the Oaxaca right now ."}
{"text":"I only became a fan of Freshii a few months ago, and now it's become a staple in my on-the-go diet. Even though you can track these places down easily I was quite happy to find out they were opening a location two minutes from my house.  They're right below the new Globe & Mail offices, which is going to be a rapidly changing intersection, but for now is pleasant and relatively quiet. With that comes a very spacious sidewalk that's also nice and bright during the evening. Staff is always polite and quick, so no complaints about the service. Ritual is even better when you don't want to mess around. I've always got take-away here, but it's a spot I would hang out in. Lots of seating options whether you're alone or some pals, and (being a new spot) the restaurant is quite clean.  Salads, bowls, and burritos are all good. It's got that fast-food vibe and quality, but I don't feel like garbage eating anything there. Smokehouse burrito is usually my top choice, though I gotta start getting them to press it longer -- it's never hot enough. Mediterranean bowl is probably my favourite -- the feta cheese and quinoa mix so well together. Make sure to throw some chicken or tofu on there!  Good food, decent prices for a healthy spot, great location."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Freshii when I stopped into Madison. I got the Buddha bowl with chicken, lemongrass cilantro soup, and  a green energy juice. It was a total of $20 but I was a ton of food. My friend and I shared everything and we had plenty of leftovers. It was very filling and I didn't feel like a pig leaving!"}
{"text":"Located inside a busy food strip mall with mostly fast food and chain restaurants, Freshii is a refreshing spot to grab a quick lunch.   Freshii offers a few different options and many more options for you to customize your meal how you want.  You can have a bowl, a salad, a wrap or soup.  They have a section where you can choose unlimited items for no extra cost and then another section for things with added cost.  When I do select items with extra cost, I find they don't give you enough of it.   Selecting avocado got me 3 pieces and the grilled tofu was both tasteless and so small you'd miss it if you're not looking at your every bite.  I love how they categorize the dressing so its easy to make the healthier choice.    While I do appreciate being able to customize my meal, I am not sure if its worth the cost.  My salad and drink cost $12 and I am no happier than a pre-mix salad from other places."}
{"text":"This place is bizarre..  sometimes it's quite good, othertimes it literally tastes like just chopped vegetables in a bowl and I want to throw it out almost right away  Which leads to the biggest problem:  I can order the same thing 5 times and get 5 different tasting items every time I order it, because the people making it have no type of actual standard or procedure.  Sometimes they just slop the shit in the bowl.  Sometimes they shake it in a bag with dressing.  Sometimes they divide it into \"quarters\" on top of a bed of rice.  Sometimes they layer it like a bean dip.  What the hell is going on over here lol"}
{"text":"Great burrito with avocado. Affordable when traveling and wanting to eat healthy food. I added chicken for a little protein."}
{"text":"The entrées are overpriced and underwhelming!the amount of meat on salads is tiny.. and the staff is rude. I asked for sauce on the side and they told me it was too late to request it and gave me a salad drenched in dressing.. yuck! I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest rip off. You pay $10 for a meal with the smallest amount of toppings, and just a massive bowl of rice. I'm usually just eating plain rice with sriracha towards the end. I feel so ripped off every time I eat from there that I always vow to never return. Compared to IQ foods, this place is a complete joke. I honesty hope this place closes. Check out Bibab Express north of Bloor on Yonge as an alternative to this place.  Also, Freshii has the WORST customer service. I found a decaying leaf in my bowl once a while ago and I emailed them a picture of it. I never heard back."}
{"text":"Good fresh food for a reasonable price. Had the pokii bowl with chicken which was good."}
{"text":"\"Fresh and healthy\" fast food? Yeah right. I got a Metaboost salad because it seemed great on the menu board, and like something I would make myself at home. But look at their nutrition information and then you realize this isn't healthy at all. How much cheese are they putting on my salad if it has 48 grams of fat? Did they dump the whole goat on it? Good lord."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  was pleasantly surprised at how good my dish was.  Had a dish with brown rice and tons of vegetables and chicken.  very good!  Fairly quick service too"}
{"text":"I'm dieting right now, so my review will reflect how difficult it is to  eat out in the city, without restaurants hating you.  the staff is kinda ... (i'll say it ..) RUDE. They always make me feel bad for special requests (ie. NO NUTS or oils) or quizzing them on the exact contents of my meal.  I need to know what I eating. So don't make me feel bad for asking.   It's also expensive. $14 for shredded zucchini with a few bits of bitter sun dried tomatoes?    Yucko.  I wish they had sizes for the fresh drinks. The generic 'one size' is too big.  Oh, and it cost me 8 bucks!   Last time I ate in, I was served my meal, but my smoothly hadn't arrived at my table yet.  :(   IMHO, this place is completely over rated. The food is bland, and not worth the price they charge."}
{"text":"UPDATE AFTER A SECOND VISIT:  Upon further inspection, it seems to me that although they advertise as being healthy (and generally are), almost all of their meals are high in fat content. And since they don't allow you to \"Create Your Own\" anything, there's only so much you can do to fix that. Now on to my experience...  Employee seemed uninterested in me until the last second. When I gave my order, I was spoken to in a clipped way that made me feel like she didn't care, or just wanted to get it over with. I don't need any special service, but it was a bit off-putting.  Asked for kale instead of spinach/romaine. Paid extra for said kale. Still got spinach/romaine (I got it as take-out so didn't notice until I was at my later destination).  Asked for no dressing. It was SMOTHERED in dressing, so much so that most of my salad was soggy by the time I got to eat it.   No, this place isn't terrible. It's fine. But the customer service and menu versatility seems to be seriously lacking. I have dropped my review from 3 to 2 stars because of my combined experiences.   ORIGINAL REVIEW:   Tried this place post workout between classes because I wanted a healthier option.  There was another girl having problems with her order because she wanted a smaller portion (the portions are pretty huge, I will admit). One of the employees told her that the wrap was a smaller portion, so she asked for the wrap without a tortilla. The other employee couldn't get it through her head that that wasn't to be rung up as a salad. In the end, the first employee ended up giving her the smaller salad as a \"wrap,\" but it was a lot of grief over something pretty simple.   I like that they have healthy options. It's weird that they have everything set up like a health-food Chipotle, but they don't let you just customize whatever you want - you have to pick something off the menu and then you can switch a couple things around if you wanna have the conversation with them about it. There are a lot of proteins and \"superfoods,' like kale, that you can add for like a dollar. I did that, but I have to say, $8.47 is a little on the pricy side for a salad, even if it was pretty big. I asked for dressing on the side and there was still dressing put on the salad. Oh well. I'm not really a big complainer, and it was good-tasting dressing anyways  They shake up the salads for you, which I actually kind of liked because I hate it when all the toppings are gone in the first few bites. It was a good salad, the superbiotic one. I was more or less satisfied.  Oh, and they take M&G. So I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Always avoided Freshii like the plague because of one bad experience I had years ago similar to the people who gave this place 1 star. But recently started eating super healthy and decided to give it a shot again.  Really enjoyed the portions and freshness here.  Tried the teriyaki twist bowl. It was generous. Subbed brown rice for quinoa and kale for 0.99. Added beef for $3.50. The beef was lean and tasted decent/healthy. Overall it was really fresh and more meat than I expected. Also the teriyaki sauce was not bad. Would come back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I don't recommend going here if you're on a scheduled lunch break. They're very busy right now and still working out some kinks. Today, for example, the ticket didn't print out for my wrap and I waited 30 minutes to find out my food wasn't coming. The manager made my order, and after all that, it was also wrong. The owners are really cool though, and they gave me a card for a free meal. I'll keep going back for now, but I don't know if this is a viable lunch option for downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The lady that worked here was super grumpy. NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY. We got Asian vegetable soup which had NO flavor. We also got a Baja burrito and a lemongrass burrito which were both AWFUL. They were SOOO spicy without any warning, and the food wasn't even hot. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Freshii one of two locations in SE Calgary. Nice to have this healthy choice in Mahogany Urban Village.   Staff are friendly and portions are okay.   I do enjoy the dining area it's small but the seats and decor are fun.   Menu is not large and mix of few smoothies, salads and sandwiches.   Overall limiting menu but healthy choice."}
{"text":"Ever since I went to New York on business and found this little deli on the main floor of the office building that served up ready-to-go salads and allowed you to select your ingredients and dressings and billed you accordingly.  The cost of a decently tasty salad ranged somewhere in the $4.00 to $6.00 range.  Like you didn't need another reason to go to New York.  So, when I returned to Toronto, I rued the fact that we had no such offering.  Well, shut me up, Lettuce Eatery.  Newly opened at the corner of Spadina and Richmond, Lettuce Eatery does the very same thing its deli sister does in New York.  Pick a bowl of your greens and from a sheet of paper, tick off all the ingredients and dressings you want.  Once you've done that, they set about constructing your salad to suit your needs.  The form is a bit long to go through and the salads are a bit pricier than New York, but the freshness and range of ingredients still reminds me of New York.  For a healthy option, you could do much worse.  I'm now looking to Lettuce Eatery to provide more New York-y offerings.  Please put street dogs and pretzels on the menu for when I next return."}
{"text":"First off I will say I love the food! The place is very clean but that is not what this is about. I went to the counter. A very unenthusiastic man took my order, no smile. looked tired. I order and he asks if I want anything else. No Thank You , I go and wait for my food. I see the juices and decide I want a juice. I go back and smile, say I am sorry I would like something else and give him my card......he looks at me and sighs a huge sigh...like a child. He proceeds to say....I suppose you do not know anything about being a small business owner.......WHAT? He was upset I used my card 2 times and he was charged!! I explain perhaps he should have asked me to use debit ....he had no clue. Perhaps YOU sir should learn something about being a small business owner, especially when I am ordering a 15.00 lunch and going out of my way to go there!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of freshii's and usually get the same thing but this location was pretty bad. I ordered the soup and there was probably all of 10 noodles (not even full noodles but like the last bits of a package all cut up) there was also an unidentified ingredient that I took out and the chicken was fatty and seemed poor quality. Won't go back to this one."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is extremely rude. Will stick to the other Freshii locations downtown!"}
{"text":"I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me.   Oh, and the Cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!"}
{"text":"Not customer service oriented people. Much better value at salad days. The wrap was small, the wrap itself tasted glutany and cheap. For a 10 dollar wrap they want to charge extra for cucumbers. they forgot to put the dressing, the falafels tasted old. everything was terrible would never return"}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the massive line at lunchtime - it moves fast. When it's busy, they give you a piece of paper when you are way back in the line that lets you check off what you want in your salad (get the salad). Then you move through, pay for it and wait for them to call your name. Pretty easy!  Salads are big, filling (almost too filling!?) and the produce is fresh. try the cucumber dill dressing, its GOOOOD and closely resembles tzaziki.   3 stars because:   It's kind of price  - 10-12 bones for a to go salad seems a little extreme, can't they have a smaller size?!  Sometimes it makes me feel REALLY ill - maybe just my body rejecting fresh food?"}
{"text":"Another great addition to Mahogany Village, I like their bowls and wraps. It's nice to have a healthier option for days when I am not organized enough to make myself a lunch. The location is brand new so it's nice and clean and the staff were friendly and helpful for being brand new. It looks like they have Poke bowls on the menu now and they also offer juice cleanses, two things that I want to try out!"}
{"text":"Love the burrito wraps, tastes healthy and the sauces are amazing. This place is my go-to on-the-go food before my subway ride. The drinks are really expensive though.. and they're really small."}
{"text":"Great, healthy food. Downside is that it's pretty expensive. Love the Pangoa bowl, but if you are watching calories, look out, as it's 770 before adding protein (the chicken is really delicious). All in all a great place, but expensive enough that it is only a once in a while treat for myself."}
{"text":"Another day, another Freshii meal. The food is great as always, can't go wrong with freshii.  This particular location is kind of small but still fit to grab a quick bite. It actually looks like it's one of the older version. My overall experience was great! 5/5"}
{"text":"This is my favourite freshii location! I visit this location at least 3 times per week, and each time that I've been here, the food and service has been amazing."}
{"text":"Freshii is great. However, the staff at this particular location seems like they need better training with preparing the food and customer service skills. The staff is very awkward to communicate with. They frequently make errors with the food. I ordered from the mobile app and they did not know what that was when I got there. Very disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"Place looks nice and fresh but food tastes like . Like not in an, it's healthy so it doesn't taste that great kind of way either. Like it just tastes BAD! My steak egg and cheese burrito that was 7.99 and mini size had bits of chewy steak that tasted fishy. Also said they were out of ketchup so I couldn't event try to mask the flavor. Ended up taking a couple bites and tossing it... Biggest waste of money, I'm going to Denny's to wash the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Delicioso !! My Freshii Green is a great simple option to something filling and healthy.. I also got some energy bites and I am so excited they remind me of a place back home.. oo and a recovery drink for my homie lol"}
{"text":"Time to update my review:  I think this Freshii location has passed through some of its growing pains.  The STAFF have gotten much better.  There are two women that work there that are incredibly helpful and friendly.  There's also a guy I'm not such a fan of who's looking for any opportunity to upcharge you...this is on top of their business model of upsetting you.    The FOOD: well, I've found a winner.  The spicy Thai burrito is my go-to.  The quinoa is healthy and full of protein.  Some nice vegetables like the edamame and carrot are thrown in.  The lemongrass sauce (which I like a bit extra of) is very flavourful and indeed quite spicy.  The other items on the menu, I tend to find a bit \"meh\" though.  They're basically just kind of bland ingredients tossed in a bowl (or burrito) without enough thought given to the combination to make them a cohesive whole.  Don't even attempt to order the custom items or you will regret it once the cash register is done with your item.  OVERALL, this store is much better than before, but still not great.   They have a couple nice staff members now too.  Basically, if I'm in the mood for a spicy Thai burrito and one or both of the nice women are working, I go in.  If I'm not in the mood for that item, or Mr. Upcharge is working, I skip it."}
{"text":"One of my go-to lunch options on the west side. I have never had a bad meal here. Love how they shake up the salads for you so everything is pre-mixed right before you eat.   I would have to say the mediterranean bowl is a favorite, with quinoa, greens, tomatoes, red peppers, cucumber, kalamata, almonds, and feta. Such a great balance, and they throw on a red pepper sauce that is to die for. Also doesn't hurt not having that bloated, tired post-lunch depression you get from other places.  Staff is super friendly and willing to give opinions for those who can't make up their mind.  Low-down: Diverse menu, quality ingredients, friendly staff. 5 stars every time i go."}
{"text":"Service - extremely slow.   Food - i ordered a burrito. Lady handled it like a surgery. Making 3 burrito made her say \"this is too much\""}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with friends. The chicken salad was really tasty. But the pad thai soup was really blend. No taste at all. It was accompanied with falafel- soo soo good the falalel. It was the only thing that was tasty from the soup. We took the green juice the lemongrass taste was really strong- if you love that taste then that's your place to go."}
{"text":"First time here. Always wanted to try. Interesting menu indeed.   Had the smokehouse burrito and added falafel   Made fast. Good service. Amazing value for the price!  $10 lunch including drink!  Freshly made. Great ingredients. Perfect amount of spice.   The place is also spotless clean. One of the busier lunch places in the plaza.   I want to come back and try their Cobb salad. Someone else ordered it with chicken on top and it looks amazing.   I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Looks all nice, and the ladies that work at this location are very friendly.... However I found a large moth in my salad. Sadly after mentioning this to others, I am hearing more horror stories of bugs in food from this location"}
{"text":"I visited Freshii during a weekday morning for their \"chipotfrii\" promo (1/2 of any Mexican item).    The breakfast burrito contains scrambled eggs, salsa, beans, cheese, and avocado. I appreciated the avocado, as it was exactly ripe, and the burrito was griddle pressed after assembly.  I did notice the fresh juices on the menu, but I'm not sure if I will ever pay $6 for a juice, even though my understanding is that this is an average juice price.  The interior is very large, super clean and polished, and has free wifi. No other customers were present during my visit.  I would consider visiting for a more virtuous lunch than the majority of restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"Like a chipotle skewed more towards healthier options.  The store is bright and airy and wasn't at all busy when I stopped in.  I needed a juice and decided on the Red Power Juice-beet, carrot, ginger and lemon.  Made while you wait, the juice was exactly what I was looking for.  Definitely would be back to try another or try some of their food options"}
{"text":"Maybe it's my wrong choice . Cause it was my first order at this place . Breakfast egg burrito has too much black beans. McD's or Tim's cheap one has better taste . Feels like they put too much cheap stuff instead egg or cheese. Can't eat this. Too heavy and texture wasn't right. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I know this is a big business and prob will NEVER read this review but I was Sooo Impressed with the food at Freshi the MANY MANY times we ate here...Likd everyday! The employees were nice but it's just like a fast service you know so nothing over the top BUT the food is what gives it a5 STAR rating  THANKYOU for coming to CALGARY FRESHI!"}
{"text":"I have come to this Freshii location several times. Pros:  - The staff is always friendly. - Food tastes good (IF made correctly)  Cons: - Super slow service, even when there's no other customers. - Inconsistency with food (I've ordered food that are missing 1 or 2 ingredients making the food taste blah. Every time I come, food and drink never taste the same because the staff either makes the food/drink right or forget something). - Expensive ($17 for Oaxaca bowl with filafel and a Recoverii smoothie)"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but everything is ridiculously overpriced for the portion size.  They charge you extra for \"protein\", therefore if you want a salad/bowl/wrap to actually fill you up, you need to pay upwards of $13 or more for a simple lunch.  I've been eating here off and on for a few years, and the portion sizes keep getting smaller.  Once I bought a salad for takeout and it tipped in my bag and settled.  I kid you not, once the ingredients had settled, the bowl was only 2/3 full.  Overall, the food is good as long as you have a budget for it. The metaboost salad is a good choice, but get half-dressing since they pile it on."}
{"text":"I love this place. Lots of great, healthy options. Excellent variety, friendly staff, no exorbitant prices. Doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you, but what does? Enough melancholy from me...go forth and eat healthy"}
{"text":"I got a custom salad from here for lunch and it was pretty good but  pricey for what you get. Really light on the Chicken considering you pay $2 for it. Actually, everything was pretty skimpy, the salad overall was pretty small. It did taste good though, the ingredients were fresh. The chicken was the only thing that wasn't that great...reminded me of fast food chicken kind of.."}
{"text":"Given that I work literally a block away from this location, it was just a matter of time before I sampled Freshii's wares.  The inciting incident that finally gave me a push was a pretty decent deal on the Ritual app. The problem was, though, that other people clearly had the same idea, so ordering and picking up the food was nothing short of a nightmare. But that's a rant for another time and place.  I decided to try the Pangoa bowl (\"brown rice, avocado, aged cheddar, cherry tomatoes, black beans, corn, cilantro, lime wedge, fiery bbq sauce\"), to which I added chicken and extra bbq sauce on the side.  It's an impressive amount of food, but is it delicious? Not really. The bowl is laid out surprisingly neatly, especially given the crush of orders the staff must've been dealing with, but the whole thing never becomes more than just edible sustenance.  The \"fiery bbq sauce\" is undoubtedly the culprit here, as the sweet, tangy concoction is so strong (and surprisingly spicy) that it completely obliterates all of the bowl's many other flavors. This leads, after a few bites, to a sameness that becomes oppressive, as each and every mouthful tastes exactly the same.  And given that the price point for this thing is around $10, I just can't see myself ever ordering from Freshii again."}
{"text":"Tried this spot out in an effort to grab a decent salad. We had the metaboost salad with tofu and buffalo chicken wrap. Somewhat underwhelming, the tofu was not cooked and the chicken was an unrecognizable pulp. Most concerning is the complete absence of nutritional info from their menus and websites. If your brand is healthy fresh food, why not provide nutritional info? I would suspect it is because their food is not as healthy as advertised."}
{"text":"Great place to get some healthy fast food. I recommend the bowls above other items. The smoothies are kind of disappointing. The falafel is shit so don't bother  I hope it survives because it seems more desolate than it should be"}
{"text":"Wow, disappointing.  I'm a huge fan of Freshii.  I think the world needs as many fast options healthy as it can muster so our culture doesn't go full on crazy on edible plastic and mystery meat.  My favourite at Freshii is getting the Feta & Date salad in a wrap.  The King and Church location seems to understand the concept and do it so right.  It's to the point now that I'm likely to get it a couple times a week for lunch.  It's delicious.  Try it.  HOWEVER, I just got back from the Eaton Centre location.  They turned this simple request into a major issue.  The girl handling customer order sheets sighed heavily when I explained what I wanted and said I would have to give her a second.  Then they charged me a full dollar more for presumably the same product (ok, perhaps they have more overhead because of their location, but I don't have to be happy about it.) but the real let down was that the wrap was about half the size that I'm used to getting.  The first two bites were all wrap, no salad.  So I'm sitting here, still kind of hungry and having spent more than I feel is fair.  Serious fail guys.  Go visit your colleagues at King and Church and learn how to do this right."}
{"text":"I was happy to see something moving into the deserted space left behind by union juice, but have been hesitant to try its replacement, freshii. We went in and got two smoothies, a tex mex burrito with chicken, and a Cobb salad with pesto chicken. Total came to $38.23 which is surprising given that people call this the poor man's Fresh. The smoothies were both okay but a bit on the sweet side. The burrito was passable. Flavors were good but texture was quite mushy. The salad was a complete miss and totally inedible. I literally had to throw it out. The thing was DRENCHED in a sweet vinaigrette and the bacon was fatty and limp. The chicken was strangely chewy too. I ended up throwing it out after a couple of bites so now have to figure out something else for lunch. I think the people working here may have never interacted with other humans before. They pretty much whisper the entire time and move very very slowly. My request to put the dressing on the side was completely missed and our questionS about the breakfast menu were totally ignored. I doubt this place will last with the real deal (fresh) just down the street."}
{"text":"I left this place with a negative feeling even though I wanted to like it. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and a smoothie. When I went to pay and found out that a smoothie was $6, I was a bit shocked. A bit on the high side, but I'm okay with the premium if it was truly good. As I watched them make it, I lost confidence fast. They used water in it instead of ice causing it to come out barely chilled. To top it off, this expensive mediocre smoothie is only 10oz. As for the buffalo chicken wrap, it was decent. I would willingly eat it again, but there are tons of other restaurants that can deliver the same thing. In the end I will probably let this bad experience stop me from coming back. There wasn't enough upside to overcome this poor experience."}
{"text":"Great place.  Was craving something fresh and healthy, and this place popped up.  Wellll, alrighty then!  Had a green juice.  They pre-make them (but they aren't old), which is nice because you don't have to wait nine hours for a juice to appear and get in your belly.  Also had the lemongrass soup with vegan broth and tofu.  Had rice noodles and plenty of veggies.  Quite tasty and had a nice spice level.  Added some sriracha for extra oomph.  Was very filling, but calories were actually pretty low--like 500 for everything.  Price was maybe $14 for everything.  Not bad, you can go broke buying kale juice.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I like the lemongrass soup and the Bangkok burrito. But don't bother paying extra for a protein, they're so stingy with meat it might as well not even be in there."}
{"text":"After several disappointing visits to various Freshii locations over the years I usually avoid the place, but there aren't a lot of options at Terminal 3. Ironically, I've always found the food at Freshii to be not so fresh.  This time I decided on frozen yogurt topped with fresh mango. I'm a big frozen yogurt fan but I've never felt compelled to try Freshii's...and now I definitely know why.  I was about halfway through when I found some sort of insect in the frozen yogurt, so yeah, that was the end of that.  When I brought it back to the counter they asked if I wanted a new frozen yogurt to which I gave an emphatic \"no thanks.\"  I asked for a refund but they couldn't reverse the charge on my credit card (really more like not willing...the manager wasn't there so the staff member probably wasn't allowed).  I had to wait for a customer to pay cash so they could open the cash drawer to refund my money.  I don't plan on eating anything from Freshii ever again."}
{"text":"There is little competition near by, allowing this freshi to continue despite being sub par.   - They continue to charge extra for protein, pricing themselves too high. - They have attempted to copy the Kumfert and Kim menu and charge the same price. Problem is Kumpfert and Kim is far better. - Their rice is like a mush. - The ingredients are not the freshest and they skimp on the ingredients (beans, corn, tomatoes). - The Venue is ok with a park you can sit outside at down the street.  Punch line is; Kumpfert and Kim should open up here and bring some real competition. Until then, the aroma cafe down the street is better value by a mile."}
{"text":"Unfortunately pretty expensive compared to Chipotle or other similar competitors, but at this location, you essentially have to put out some dough to get what you want, otherwise you'll be stuck with something like McDonalds, Tim Hortons, or other. Pretty sad you have to pay extra for protein, instead of your bowl already coming with it. I paid about $13.50 for my Chicken Tex-Mex style bowl. Also, it doesn't automatically come with lettuce, but I asked for it afterwards and they were happy to provide me with a small portion for me to add to my bowl. I'd only come here if there were no other options for fresh, burrito-style bowls. Otherwise, I'd stick to Chipotle, Mucho Burrito, etc."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritios, absolutely killer.  The coffee isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Was very surprised very friendly staff and the food was very very tasty! I can see getting this to go for a healthy dinner or lunch!  Don't drive by stop in and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place, tasty fresh and filling.  And healthy!!!  Got the Pangoa Bowl with Banana Nut Crunch Smoothie.  Very good."}
{"text":"This place has such great delicious healthy food options! The food is surprisingly flavourful..But even the service was awesome! Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Freshii until today. Prior to the changes, the quality/service was much better and more efficient.   The customization idea is great but now they limit it to 6 toppings prior to this it was unlimited, anything additional will cost extra. Today I ordered the Cobb salad which I have ordered before, which I enjoyed each time. However today it was a different story, the portion has decreased and the toppings are less. I barely saw any cheese and the person who made my salad claimed they had put avocado but there was none. I asked and he gave me three chunks of avocado. I also asked for dressing on the side but the person who took my order never wrote it down. Paying 10.70$ for a salad and feeling less than satisfied isn't worth it in my opinion.   This location isn't as attentive as it used to be nor is it customer friendly. The atmosphere is bright and more attractive in comparison to before but everything else is lacking. I was truly disappointed. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I've had issues with the app since day one. I've inquired about it. No one is really ever concerned. I'm a frequent customer too which is a bummer. And today I get home, after $20, and order was wrong."}
{"text":"Ok so finally tried this pace after passing it everyday! It did not disappoint. I got the Buddha bowl, it was great. All fresh ingredients. I all tried the the Mighty Detox juice. Very pleasant and tasty. I will definitely be back here!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but my issue was the service. There were over 10 staff members behind the counter but only  4 were working while the others were standing there talking to each other. It took over 10 minutes for my noodle bowl and it was made in slow motion. Glad I wasn't in a rush."}
{"text":"Myself and some work friends have been wanting to check out Freshii for the past few weeks and today we finally made it happen. First of all, the atmosphere of this place is very cool and chill. From the grass wall to the open seating to the personable workers who actually use you name, I really dig this place.  Lots of great options from salads and wraps to burritos, salads and bowls. All come vegetarian with an option to add protein at an up charge.  They also do a range of smoothies and juices.  You can customize anything with a card and they get points for having Sriracha available.  I stuck with the Khao San Burrito which had brown rice, spinach, almonds, edamame, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, spicy peanut & lemongrass sauce clocking in at 650 cals.  And let me just say, nutrition fills you up. Between this and a bag of crisps, I was feeling very satisfied. All that and a bottled drink ran me just under $12 for lunch. Not bad but it is on the pricey side in my opinion. Adding a protein or a smoothie would easily bump this to $16.  Honestly, the Burrito was fantastic. Tons of flavor and true to the name, fresh(ii)!  We went between 11a and Noon with minimal wait time but on the way out there was a good crowd so expect a bit of a wait at lunch. One thing we noted was for being what appears to be a very green organization, there isn't any recycling.   It's not a deal breaker by any means and maybe logistically it wouldn't work but I feel like it is a missed opportunity.  Overall, I'm really impressed and this is now a solid option in my book. Check them out for sure!"}
{"text":"Tasteless Tex-Mex burrito.  Freshi seems to be chronically short of black beans cause I can't find any in my burrito.  Good coffee and smoothies.  Good washrooms otherwise the decor is fairly sterile."}
{"text":"So glad there is another healthy option in Pittsburgh. The cali bowl and egg pockets are fast and delicious, and for lunch there are some great salads, bowls and smoothies. The Pangoa bowl has become one of my go to lunch options for sure!"}
{"text":"I went to Freshii at Islington and Bloor for the first time and ordered the light frozen yogurt with mango. It was not that big and very over priced,  about 4 .  The staff was very rude about providing nutritional information. The yogurt itself tasted good but the mangoes were very odd tasting.  I can do much better getting mangoes at the grocery store and McDonald's icecream."}
{"text":"My first and probably last time at Freshii, I paid $10+ for a Buddha bowl with tofu, with \"spicy peanut sauce,\" chili powder, and green onions. I was expecting an explosion of flavour with that description. It was so bland. I was so sad that I couldn't finish it... I put the leftovers in the fridge, and the next day my mom asked what bland nonsense it was that I had the audacity to bring into her home.  Freshii, do yourself a favour and take out your flavour descriptors. Disappointing as hell."}
{"text":"Today I visited the Yonge & St Clair location and had questions related to menu items that contained gluten. The response I got from the female team member was \"they're just vegetables\". My response was to ask whether there was gluten in the salad items. Her response was to say \"nothing has changed in the menu lately\". Bear in mind, that I am not a regular at this location. I then asked whether there was gluten in the optional proteins. The female staff member adamantly refused to check whether there was gluten in the proteins. I explained that at another location there was a book with the list of ingredients that staff referred to. The employee stared at the list of menu items on the sheet that customers can select and repeated \"nothing has changed\". I told her I would take the salad without proteins. With such poor customer service I will go to the Summerhill location instead, where service is better."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location, and I'd have to say it was great! The staff were very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the Zen Salad and added chicken and falafel as protein. Hands down, it's the best salad I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I really don't get the appeal.   I made a few visits there because I bought a gift card from one of the daily deal sites at half price.  I think it was a $40 card for $20.  In my opinion, that's the only way that this place is reasonable.  Yes, they have a wide selection of wraps and salads.  But they are incredibly skimpy on the higher quality ingredients, especially the protein.  For example, twice I tried the cobb wrap (with chicken and bacon), for about $9.  Both times it had  a discernible amount of chicken, yes, but the bacon was of the invisible variety (not my favorite kind).  I had a similar experience when I \"built my own\" wrap, and actually I'm still pretty sure that one of the ingredients (for which I paid $1.50) was left out of the wrap completely.  All that said, Freshii is healthy and for many of the office workers that flock there, they need this as an option.  I just think Freshii could do a better job by ensuring that their products contain less filler."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequently buy from freshii, mostly from the downtown core and our go-to Leslie and don mills location. On that eating healthy vibe lately. No complaints thus far though we notice quality/quantity does vary across locations. Today while driving in Scarborough I decided to stop by the Milner location as the wife wanted to eat \"clean\". My wife mentioned that I should probably avoid buying from a Scarborough location as the quality would be very lacking. As I grew up here I felt compelled to tell her that freshii has a general standard and that's it's all the same; don't be a hater. Ordered my usual salad. Got home and saw beet juice dripping on the carpet as I was walking in with the bag. Opened the bag and saw that the salad was doused in beet juice. I ordered shaved beets as a topping, not beet juice! Broccoli was stale and turning brown as well. Wut the f**k Scarborough. You let me down! Should have stuck with my initial gut craving, which was jerk or Vietnamese while in Scarborough. That's what I get for eating salad on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I like this place because it provides healthy food options. They serve wraps, bowls, salads and burritos which you can choose from the menu or custom make with a large and diversified choice of ingredients. The prices for the items on the menu are reasonable however I find that everything that is custom made is a little more expensive than it should be, however it tastes good and the portions are consistent. They also have a nice terrasse during spring and summer."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the freshii at the university location.  They were friendly and able to help me with food that could be prepared separately from the other food as I must eat gluten free.  I had the Mediterranean bowl.    It was fresh, but it was a little bland outside of the roasted red peppers.  I think it could have had more feta on it as well.  The place was clean.  The staff pleasant, and the service was fast, but I don't think that I would order it again.  I think it is a great place to eat if you are into salads, but I found it a little light on content."}
{"text":"For a decent and somewhat healthy lunch this a great spot. Only give it three stars because it's nothing special but the food is good and they are pretty quick. Great if you have vegetarians with you as well as all of their option can be vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was great. I had an awesome healthy salad. I have some chicken in it. 450 calories not bad for lunch.  The line was long but super quick Service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Oaxaca salad bowl and when I arrived home about ten minutes later I found the avocados to be brown in colour.  I had to thrown them away as it was a turn-off.  In addition, the lime that they provided me was completely dry and I barely got two drops out of it! So much for a \"fresh\" salad!! Most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot because it's hard to find healthy vegetarian food that has protein in it. I love the concept of Freshii and the service here is always fast.   I do agree that sometimes they add ingredients that you did not indicate that you wanted, or forget ingredients that you did want. I usually mark off almost everything that is not extra charge and sometimes one thing from the protein category. If you get too many extra things, your order will get really expensive."}
{"text":"I come here for their Oaxaca bowls - they're simply amazing!  (And I finally learned how to pronounce it properly! Lol)"}
{"text":"I'm glad there's a Freshii in the Overstreet Mall Uptown.  It provides a quick place to get breakfast or lunch for those that work/visit.   Since I walk here from my building, I wouldn't have any clue where to park (if you were driving)... probably the BB&T parking deck will get your the closest, but I'm not sure what their rates are.  Freshii is located at the far end of the Overstreet Mall in the last nook, there's a small counter where you order at and some tables to sit and enjoy your salad or various items on their menu.    For breakfast they do some breakfast pockets and a couple of burritos.  You can also do your juicing here... I have never partaken, but I always love to watch the staff throw a bunch of vegetables into the juicer and hand it to the customer.  Overall their ingredients are fresh and I like the convenience.  There tends to be a \"mad rush\" during lunch, but I catch them on the off hours so that I don't have to wait too long.  They are super fast anyway!"}
{"text":"First visit and last visit.   I ordered a bowl that was labelled as a best-seller on the menu board.   Since the order card listed premium toppings with additional prices and then unlimited toppings with no prices listed, I thought I'd add a couple things.  Sadly the order card is misleading.  The \"unlimited toppings\" are in fact not unlimited and cost extra for each.   I did choose to pay an extra $1 for avocado, but there were only a few small chunks which left me feeling disappointed and ripped off.   The bowl did taste ok, and the ingredients were fresh and almost healthy but the price left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was essentially a big bowl full of brown rice with a few token veg thrown in with too much salt.   I doubt I will ever return since there are so many other options in this city that offer more yum for less cash.  Honestly... $11 for a lackluster and tiny lunch is quite ridiculous."}
{"text":"I think its a healthier option. I ordered the Buddha Satay with Chicken. So how they mix it is quite interesting. They put it in a bag and shake it all up with the sauce. The taste is ok. Only thing I found is that the sauce is a bit diluted and runny. Also the bowl is a bit spicy. Not sure if you can say its healthy. Well I found the taste ok.  Price is ok as well. I mean its food court food. So you can't expect too much. There are a few seats inside this restaurant. Well, we were lucky and got a seat. If there are no seats left there are seats around the corner in the Chevron building.   Overall this place is ok. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"well I think I have to remind myself that Freshii isn't my fortes. My colleague loves this place. But overall, you have to like it or not. I think its just too healthy for me. I got the Teriyaki chicken. Well you know the chicken was blanched and then teriyaki sauce was added it to. It was too much sauce making the whole meal very salty.   Well, I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a review for Freshii's frozen yogurt!  I love it, and have come back here several times just for the frozen yogurt!  It's $3.20 with tax and everything for a small with 2 toppings.  I love how it's simple, no crazy flavours, the toppings are fresh and they give you the small size in a large cup so you have plenty of room in the cup to mix if you wish to do.  My favourite is pecans and fresh strawberries or blueberries."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Friday afternoon  I tried the Oaxaca Bowl with Chicken (pron. Wha-haka) and it was delicious! The service was also fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Before I went to this place, I was under the impression that a fast food, salad assembly line, should be fresh, tasty, and fast.  But I was terribly mistaken.  I gave Lettuce Eatery a fighting chance, frequenting the place on many a lunch hour, because nothing healthy was close by.  But the place never ceased to amaze me.  Despite its many workers behind the counter, almost always outnumbering the clientele, they just couldn't seem to get the food out.  Going there was stress inducing because I was constantly having to stop myself from jumping the counter and grabbing the bloody ingredients myself.  The only thing that kept me from behaving so erratically was the fact that the choices behind the counter  were either wilted, tasteless, or just plain uninteresting.  Unless you are in a self-destructive mood, and feel like trying your tastebuds or giving your patience a real run for its money, the place is just no good."}
{"text":"Imagine your soup falling through the bottom of your paper bag.  The best outcome is you catch the soup and nothing is lost.  You could end up with soup on you and saving some soup to eat.  The worst outcome is the soup is compleyely lost as it splashes all over you and hits the ground.  I got lucky and only a small amount of soup got on me and the rest wasn't lost.  Lucky in one sense and not another.  The soup container had a cracked lip, the lid was pressed on it poorly and together these caused soup to leak from the container and weaken the paper bag.  Freshii could use plastic bags and avoid this.  The staff could also not used a cracked container and probably have avoided this.  I wasn't happy scrambling to catch soup as it broke through the bag.  I was angry when I had time to examine the container and figure out what exactly had happened.  I have pictures and will upload them.  As for the food, it was alright.  Not good, but barely ok.  I really wanted soup so I got soup.  I can only advise you there are better soup places for the same price or less.  More service problems: you can try and call in an order but I am yet to have anyone answer.  The app for iOS doesn't work like it should.  I would only ever consider eating here if it is convenient and you double check your containers before leaving."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend, impressed by the customizable salads/bowls. I got a rice noodle with chicken and avocado. The options were plentiful and everything tasted fresh. The warm teriyaki was delish. Quite pricey for a salad box but seems to be the case everywhere in the 10km radius."}
{"text":"Goat-cheese, brown rice and balsamic vinegar; that was pretty much all I could taste in $7 lunch. Not a fan of new-age interpretations of the burrito.  TIP: Freshii offers Wi-Fi, but the signal from Starbucks next door works too."}
{"text":"Freshii used to be decent and this lady who used to work there was awesome. I came here quickly to grab a salad and to my horror, noticed they no longer carry different flavours of chicken (BBQ, Cajun etc.) When I actually tried the chicken in my salad it tasted gross and fake compared to what they used to have. So disappointed. Go somewhere else for your salad!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Freshii. When they get it right, I love it. When they get it wrong, i hate it - and to be honest, they get it wrong a lot.   Pros: Convenient, fast, you can customize your salad/wrap/bowl with a plethora of fresh ingredients and sauces that fits any craving, Price is about right compared to paying by weight for salads in a lot of similar restaurants.  Cons: Inconsistency. When I've paid $11 for a noodle bowl and I get a huge, heavy clump of noodles with no sauce and barely any ingredients, I'm annoyed. And as I say, it happens a lot.  For me, I stick to the salads which tend to be more consistent although the dressing disbursement can be the inconsistent factor there. Sometimes not enough, sometimes drowning - depends who makes your salad.   You probably won't be amazed if you go here on a regular basis but the pros do outweigh the cons a decent percentage of the time for me so as long as you manage your expectations, it's ok."}
{"text":"Very quick service. I got there at 6:30am.  I chose the Rancho breakfast burrito which had plenty of eggs, avocado, salsa... I liked that it was not soggy at the bottom. I was also surprised that the burrito was toasted. It was too toasted though, a bit charred but definitely hot and crunchy.  Tasty, would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"I ordered off of ritual and got my order super quick despite there being a very long line with over 20 people around the small stall which is located in the lowest floor of the eatons centre.  I think everyone was there for the $3 off promo today.   I've Eaten at freshii plenty of times. I have pretty mixed feelings. Some stuff is okay, some stuff is horrible. I've never tried anything twice and generally avoid it as the last time i went (location near college), the soup literally tasted like water with rice noodles and sparse veggies floating in it.  Today I was on my way getting a toasted bagel when I got a ritual notification that Freshii was $3 off today. I decided to go for the feista wrap with beet slaw. After the $3 off I believe I paid just short of $7. The beet slaw extra was a $0.25 which I found cheap. There were many extra toppings such as protein available. Everything on their menu is vegetarian and does not include any protein which is about $3 extra.  The veggie wrap was large and thickly wrapped which I like. I found the different ingredients to be spread out evenly through the wrap and noticed that lettuce surrounded everything so it wouldn't soak the tortilla as quick. I really enjoyed the beet slaw and the dressing/sauce used in the wrap. The avocado was also perfectly ripe. Everything was. Even the lettuce was flawless. This could very well be my new favourite wrap, beating the McDonald's vegetarian Santa fe wrap.  My only complaint is that the wrap still leaked a lot. It actually started leaking as soon as I got it so I held napkins around the bottom. As I ate more, it leaked a LOT and all over my clothes. I think I poured out 5 spoonfuls or more of liquid from the wrap. I wish the salsa and slaw were more dry or drained before being put into the wrap that has nothing to soak it up. If it were in a rice bowl, then at least the rice soaks up the juice.  Overall, I really enjoyed the taste of the fiesta wrap but I would definitely not pay full price. Almost $10 for vegetables in a tortilla? No thanks, I'd rather eat something more filling for lunch."}
{"text":"Will never come here again. My superbiotic salad was so bland, there was barely any dressing (while my friend's salad had so much it was dripping).   The worst part? For every person's salad they put the ingredients into a plastic bag to shake it all around to mix everything up....then throw it right in the trash. What a WASTE! So disappointed that ASU would allow such an unsustainable practice on the campus."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time but a co-worker convinced me to go with her for a quick bite and I am so glad I did!    Two words - collard greens!  I have been trying to eat healthier (outside of Yelp events that is) and cut down on bread and gluten products - well Freshii now offers collards as the sandwich wrap around your favorite \"innerds\".  Tried the Buffalo Blue Chicken Wrap and was wow'd by the amount of  flavour. Just enough heat from the buffalo sauce, with a nice hit of the blue cheese, before the surprise avocado cools everything off.    Its $8 but this thing is as large and jam packed as any burrito and wrapped so well you can eat it one handed with out making a huge mess (although its so big you actually need two hands to eat it).  Might split with a friend next time as it was a bit too filling for me - but I have now found my sandwich place of choice for those days when I dont want gluten."}
{"text":"First time @  Freshii's! In a place full of greasy, heart attacked options - this place gives you a healthy lunch option.  I went with the salad.  It's more fun to create your own salad with all your favourites so I went with the custom form  and started ticking those boxes. I went with most of the free options because when you add the Add-Ons its can get pretty pricey.  All ingredients are fresh so no worry of rotting veggies.  They add the dressing for you as well and I LOVE how it's not drenched - it's just enough to compliements those greens.  I ended up with a $10 salad due to adding cheese but although I my initial shock of \"omg $10 for a salad?!\" ... It was okie because it was a decent portion.  Quite filling and satisfying.   I want to try their soups next :)  Line up seems long, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Service (5 stars):  Got a salad for pick up. By the time I arrived it was ready.   Food: (4 stars) I ordered the Mediterranean salad with Chicken.  At first it looked like there was very little chicken, but I was surprised to be full after eating it.   For $11, unless you are looking for a healthier options, I would not say it is worth it.  Atmosphere: (3 stars) It is a very small place, would not recommend eating in"}
{"text":"WOW what a disappointment. This isn't the first time that I order Freshii through JustEat.ca and both times, there was a problem with the order.  First time I ordered, it took over 90 minutes to get a burrito and a salad. When placing the order, I requested to have the salad dressing on the side however when I received the order, there was dressing in the salad. Ok, whatever, it happens. We all have an off day. Fast forward to today. I once again placed an order through JustEat.ca for a Text Mex burrito (grilled) and a chicken buffalo salad. When I finally received the order, it seems the chef is having YET ANOTHER bad day. The burrito was NOT grilled and there was NO chicken in my salad. Are we serious? I called Freshii directly to advise them of the error and was told that there was nothing that can be done. Wow. So I just paid $30 for an order that technically ISNT mine and nothing can be done??  It seems as though Freshii doesn't care when they completely mess up an order but it's ok to take my money. I can assure you, Freshii, this relationship is over. It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the healthier options if you're set on eating a meal in the Eaton Centre, and that is the only reason I'm giving Freshii 3 stars and not 1.  I always order the custom soup or salad but lately I've been noticing they really skimp on certain items, even though I paid for DOUBLE!  This vexes me deeply. Skimping on strawberries and sprouts is morally wrong when you're charging these prices.  I would never come here for lunch because the lineup is sickeningly long. I mean really! Do I have to pay $15 for a salad AND wait in line 15 minutes for you to make it for me?  Not me. I guess I'm a salad diva."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Yeah it's healthy, but actually didn't seem that fresh to me.  Seemed more like fast food that's healthy.  Overpriced.  Go to Forage instead.  It blows this restaurant away - same concept, better food, good value."}
{"text":"Freshii is a blissful combination of Chipotle, Sweet Green and Chop't that I could only dream of in my wildest fantasies. AND IT IS HERE IN MADISON!   The menu includes salads that they will also assemble as wraps, interesting \"bowls\" (Asian inspired teriyaki, Mediterranean, etc), burritos, smoothies/juices and Froyo. This is healthy and delicious fast food and even better, it's decently priced! Everything can come with your choice of protein. There are some uniquely awesome options like falafel so you will never ever get bored.  I got the Fiesta salad as a wrap and never wanted it to end. The greens, corn, AVOCADO, black beans (I'm picky about black beans but these passed my test), cheese and pico de gallo went together perfectly. I added STEAK, which I was nervous about but wasn't disappointed. So impressed by the quality flank steak in my wrap; this would be served at a legitimate sit down restaurant and still be impressive. Also impressive: the steak wrap with a can of coke zero rang up to $11.  I'm only in this neighborhood if I have to go to the mall or a store nearby, so I really wish there was a Freshii in Fitchburg or downtown (can you imagine how successful it'd be with UW students?). I could totally see myself driving 15 min out of the way for this though, and will definitely be popping in anytime I'm on Gammon Road! AND DREAMING ABOUT IT EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"This is my third time to pass by this place during my lunch break as it's a short walk from the office and this has been my go-to whenever I'm in need of healthy food to cleanse my system. For the first 2 visits, I ordered their Tex Mex Burrito and added on a falafel and it's loaded with multiple colors of veggies, rice, beans, and avocado, which make it a delicious blend altogether. If you're a light eater like me, the burrito size and weight is big enough to last for 2 meals.   Today, I was craving something lighter but healthy, since our stock of salad greens at home ran out, so I ordered their featured Pesto Bowl because the picture on the ad looked very enticing and it tasted as great as it looked. The bowl is large and has an even mixture of spinach greens, thick white noodles, pesto sauce, olives, feta cheese, and other veggies and your choice of protein, which in my case was falafel. I ate some of it at the place and took the rest back to the office to snack on later.   The ambiance is impressive and decorated with green leaves and the dining area is all crafted with wood to give the impression that they are an \"au naturel\" business. The customer service here is friendly too. Upon entering, the place was packed with the lunchtime crowd so I was confused on where the lineup began but one of the staff was nice enough to direct me on where to stand. When it was my turn to order, the cashier started by saying \"Welcome to Freshii. How can I help you?\" and I also liked how they referred to every customer by first name, which makes the experience more personalized.   My rating here lies between a high 3 to a low 4-star for a few reasons. One, I paid $10.61 for the entire bowl, which I think is unreasonable for a solo item when you can get a whole combo elsewhere for the same price or even less. Two, it would be nice if they add combo deals to the menu because right now, all items, including sides and drinks, are sold separately. Three, the ingredients at this place are not specialty items so I don't understand why their items are overpriced. All the ingredients in the bowl that I ordered could easily be purchased at our local grocery store and prepared by myself, for less money. The only possible reason to justify their prices is maybe because renting in this area of Toronto is a little more expensive.   However, those factors on the whole did not ruin my experience and I still plan to come back on occasion whenever I need a good healthy, nutritious de-tox and am too lazy to pack a lunch."}
{"text":"I love Freshii. I was visiting Pittsburgh for a conference from the Portland OR area and was excited to see it was here. Strangely, it tastes exactly the same --not how they manage consistency but they are doing a great job. :) I always get the spicy lemongrass soup with tofu. So good and feels good on my sensitive stomach."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a green juice, I was really looking forward to a nice fresh juice but sadly the juice was already prepared and it tasted water down."}
{"text":"I first heard about Freshii when it became all the rage in Toronto 3 years ago.   I tried the Buddha bowl and it tasted great - but wasn't anything special. It's great for a fast food chain, fresh (haha) and tastes pretty good. It's not the sort of place you'd go out of your way to go to but hey if it's on the way why not?"}
{"text":"Normally LOVE freshii, go to lunch spot, but today they put uncooked rice in my burrito! I bit into it and it felt like biting into rocks!  Not sure what happened here.. but I don't think I'll even be able to finish this burrito without hurting my mouth :("}
{"text":"Good, quick stop to get some food. Grab a bowl you like and add meat to it if you want."}
{"text":"A salad is a salad is a salad - but for some reason it always tastes better when someone else makes it for you.  The selection is endless - you choose the lettuce type, the mixings, the dressing and even the amount of each item and level of dressing.  Unlike most choose/make your own salad places, the price is not done by weight, but by the type of protein and quantity.  There is a standard price for the base lettuce.  I normally get a spinach mix with chicken and an oil and vinegar mix, but the other day I had the Bliss Bowl....Ohhhhh amazingness to go!  Brown rice, red peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, avocado and goats cheese...I added chicken to it as well and it was just amazing!  It didn't look big when I got it, but I was full and truly \"blissed out\" for the rest of the day.   I would suggest it if you're in the mood for a yummy lunch.  I hear they have great frozen yogurt, but I've yet to have that....the summer is still young though.  This location - albeit the only one I've been in, I find is small for the volume of ppl that come through the doors.  The layout is difficult to manurer, but the staff try their best to keep the flow moving.  When you enter, you have to grab a clip board and create your order then and it to a staff member behind the counter.  While waiting, you pay for your order and they then deliver it to you while you stand randomly near the counter.  As a side note - Freshii used to be called Lettuce, so for some of you - you probably have been here and didn't notice a change.  The name change came when the US company bought them out."}
{"text":"Fairly decent bites for a fairly decent price.  Ordered the Tex Mex and it was fresh alright.  A bit cheesed that the cheese was all bunched up at the bottom.  Also, and I know how this will sound #firstworldproblems but they almost turned my business away because they couldn't change $100 bill.  Sure it's my fault that I forgot my debit card in the office but the cashier double checked and we were good to go.  Even offered to charge me less for the burrito.  Thanks Freshii...will see you again!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced considering the food portion and quality you are getting. Plus the people working there always have a bitchy face. In my opinion, the food gets spoiled by the negative attitude they are serving considering the price they are charging."}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean salad bowl which had quinoa, red onions, cucumbers, black olives, tomatoes, salad, feta cheese and hot sauce. The ingredients all went well together however I found it to be a little dry. I assumed when I got it the sauce was all at the bottom. I would ask for some extra sauce of your choice so you can enjoy it. Fresh tasting ingredients and a good healthy choice however pretty pricey at almost $12 with taxes. I didn't add meat or any extras to my bowl but if added your looking at almost a $15-$20 meal with drink. They do give a good portion which is filling."}
{"text":"A favourite of the work crowd, but I find it 'meh' for the price (and not as healthy as it masquerades to be, if you ask me). The portions are big, the service is quick, but I find it quite bland. I really wish they would mix the noodle bowls without you having to specially request it. Also, sometimes there is enough sauce and sometimes there isn't so it seems inconsistent.  By the way, very limited seating inside."}
{"text":"Buddha's Satay is so far my favorite. Teriyaki twist is second favorite when I am craving some sweetness. The Buddha's Satay has rice noodles with peanut sauce, broccoli, edamame and other fresh veggies. It tastes fresh and healthy. The Mighty Detox juice is good as well. As a juicer, I know when a juice is really juiced and this one seemed pretty authentic to me. It's like Veggie Grill, but not as good. Perhaps a biased opinion, but just my opinion.  Give it a try. They have salads, bowls, wraps and burritos. Not to mention, kids menu as well."}
{"text":"- Oaxaca salad my go-to item to order  - Service is generally good. Not exceptional  - Popular lunch time spot in the area  - Custom salads are a great option when on a diet  - Try their frozen yogurt. One of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, my partner and I go here all the time, it's healthy, FRESH, and the prices are really reasonable! Above that they're super friendly here and the service is quick. Also I just got their frozen yogurt yesterday and I'm hooked"}
{"text":"I got the Thai style burrito today and it was excellent! Prepared to order and very tasty."}
{"text":"Food was really great. I am huge fan of create your own salads and bowls and Freshii in Madison delivered a great quality meal.  Was a little pricy, but that is to be expected for healthier food. I accept the price increase for better-for-you food.  All around, a great time."}
{"text":"I've been WAITING for Madison to get something like this: fast, fresh, healthy, and delicious!  It was so hard choosing what to get because everything sounds fabulous!  I went with the spicy Thai burrito and was not disappointed.  Lines weren't too bad (at 12:30 on a Friday... Which is awesome), and it had plenty of seating with a fun exposed sealing/ rustic type setting.  I'll definitely be coming back to explore the menu further :)"}
{"text":"I was on the way to a yoga class with Jennifer K. & only ordered a low fat frozen yogurt (strawberry & banana). It was so good! I will def. be coming back to try other things next time. Fast, decently priced."}
{"text":"This place bothers me.  It's expensive and not worth it. Healthy food can taste good - it doesn't have to taste bland.   The menu is unnecessarily complex, and the soups and salads are just not worth it. Plus you can get frozen yoghurt here for like $8 for a large if you want. Yes please!!! bend me over and empty my wallet.  p.s the whole green seller is a sham. They are so not environmentally friendly in actuality. Just watch them mix up your stuff in plastic bags and serve you in take out containers that are yes biodegradable - but do not bio degrade in landfills. whats the point?"}
{"text":"Freshii prides itself on being healthy and it is healthy and fresh but for the price it's not worth it nor it is very tasty. There are also long lines at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past week.  So fresh and healthy.  And filling!!.  The staff are super friendly.  Had the Oacana bowl which was outstanding and the Khao San wrap.  Can't decide which was better.  Sampled the Fro-Yo and it was fantastic.  Go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have only had one item here- the banana walnut smoothie. I think it is very good. If you like the idea of a smoothie that tastes like a banana walnut muffin now you know where to go! It entices me more than getting a similar blended drink next door at Starbucks where the line is longer, the drink probably less healthy, and less yummy/natural.  I have had it twice- the first time was not a good experience. There were small pieces of walnuts in the smoothie (which is expected) but they must have had some walnut shell or something in there because some of the small pieces were so incredibly hard, way too hard to bite down on and swallow. In fact, it was kind of dangerous because some of the pieces were normal walnuts and lulled you into the sense that you could chew on them a bit as you sipped until you got a rock hard one. It could easily have chipped a tooth! I had to pick them out of my mouth as I was out shopping and I felt really gross and embarrassed by how it must appear to others.  But obviously I quite enjoyed the smoothie as I ordered it again today to give it another try. This time, no issue at all. It was really good!  Although this location is not that exciting or special looking inside, the smoothie is worth a stop for me. Since I've never tried the food I do plan on getting lunch to go here sometime. The atmosphere is not appealing to me to eat in and the service is okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love it.  Need a nice quick Burrito that is the right mix of protein, fat, carb and has tons of flavour...this is the place!  Not a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"This was definitely the blandest food I've had in awhile. Basically I gave two stars because it's still a healthier choice than a burger and the ingredients- even if they had zero flavour- were at least fresh. I had the buddha bowl. They should call it rice noodle flavour because it barely had anything else in it. Blech."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of this brand. The food tastes relatively healthy and is very filling. It's great for vegetarians since all the items appear vegetarian by default and then you can add meat if you like. For fast food it is a bit pricy (about $10) but I think the price is fair given the portion size. This particular location has a patio which is nice.  Con: At lunch time at this location it's really busy and you may not get as much bang for your buck if you order one of the popular dishes with meat. I've been to other locations that are not as busy and they give tons of meat....so it doesn't seem to be standardized."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often but after two bad experiences at this joint, it feels only right to warn others.  I hadn't been here in about a year as the last time I went there after been going there for a while I received a chicken wrap which contained frozen chicken. After I complained I got a refund as I didn't trust their food anymore.  Today, I was stuck for something healthy and quick so Idecided to give freshii another chance. after a year i figured it may have improved. I ordered a custom chicken noodle bowl and it looked healthy and promising. however the noodles were warm but everything else cold. it still tasted ok-ish so I ate it. an hour later Im at work sick as hell. stomach pains galore and its the only thing I ate today. I dont recommend freshii at all now and will never return."}
{"text":"I just had Freshii for the second time and it has been fantastic both times. They are super prompt and have delicious food. I had no idea fast food could be healthy! The Teriyaki Bowl w/Chicken is my favorite."}
{"text":"Buh. I really hate it when I get price gouged for opting into 'healthy choices'. Freshii banks on scrimping on the good stuff (aka protein) and loading up your salad, burrito, or wrap with their cheaper ingredients. So for 11 dollars, you get a lettuce wrap. You may have ordered their ~fancy new~ gourmet TUNA Kona wrap, but nah, they will give you like a teaspoon of that flaked tuna barely sprinkled throughout the wrap, jam pack it with romaine lettuce, throw like half an egg in there, a few slices of avocado, and bam, your allegedly \"protein packed\" tuna wrap is a crock of shit.  For 11 bucks I could have bought 2 fucking heads of lettuce, 2 cans of white albacore tuna and done this shit at home proper.  And this hasn't been a one off either. I've been to this location before and ordered their Tex Mex Burrito, with added chicken (at an extra cost of course) and it was basically a rice fucking burrito with a total of maybe like 6 pieces of cubed chicken. Tasted like ass too.  Also, what the hell is up with me coincidentally constantly frequenting places that overcharge and under deliver as of late?  Meh Meh Meh. I'm done with you Freshii. Foreverz."}
{"text":"I ended up doing their juice cleanse at this location, and for the most part, it was pretty good. They were great with scheduling. I got to the location every morning and my days juices were ready to go and they quickly put together my Metaboost salad within a few minutes and I was out the door in 10 minutes.  The juices were really nice and I enjoyed them quite a bit. And despite having reservations with having a salad as my only meal at the end of the day, the Metaboost was super filling and I didnt go to bed hungry (I did go to bed unfulfilled, lets be real, juice cleanses are soul crushing and please remind me to never do one again). Some days the juices tasted pretty watered down, so that was a meh, but otherwise, I felt it was worth the money!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, as it is a convenient location coming out straight from yoga and rushing back to work.   As the other have said, the food is incredibly underwhelming. It's a special gift they have. There is NEVER enough dressing in their wraps. PLEASE put more dressing in your wraps. I mean I get that you have a reputation of being cheap, but dressing is not an expensive ingredient. Thin it out! Add water! Anything!  Underwhelming food, but good healthy ingredients (which is why I keep giving it another and another chance). Wraps are hard as cardboard. Manager is creepy and obnoxiously peacocks as he takes payment. Bizarre place."}
{"text":"Skimpy on the toppings lately. Especially the Buddha Satay. Two little pieces of broccoli and bowl not filled to top. Twice now that the bowl has been substandard."}
{"text":"I'm convinced their business model is to distract people from how much of a ripoff it is by bombarding them with nutritional hoohaa"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place as I've heard good things. I really hadn't taken a good look at the menu before I went, I probably should have as the line made the board a little difficult to read. Once through the line I realized they did have paper menus available - just where you pick your food up. Basically it works like any Qdoba/Chipotle; choose a base item and add protein.  There was a free, self-serve water fountain for patrons which was a nice touch.   The line however, was, a little unexpected. Sure I did arrive at noon but I was not anticipating a 20+ minute wait for a to-go order. Something to keep in mind if you need to take a short lunch.  I ordered the Buddha Satay bowl - it came with rice noodles and mixed vegetables. It fell very short. The noodles were luke warm and the broccoli was just ever so slightly cooked. This would be okay but the flavor was not there - just no flavor whatsoever. No salt, no lime, no nothing to perk it up. It definitely fell flat and I would not order this again. I also added tofu for $1.99 and received about 6 of the tiniest cubes of tofu ever...sigh...I could have bought a whole one at the grocery store for that price!   Also, they did not post nutritional information to the menu...odd considering how \"healthy\" it is supposed to be. Most items do fall in the 400-600 calorie range but you can easily get up to 900 & then if you add a calorie drink on top of it!  The prices are too high for so little flavor. Maybe I tried the wrong thing and one can't go wrong with frozen yogurt...but it will be a minute before I return."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Very conveniently located, ideal for a quick take out. I usually get the custom noodle bowl with falafel, olives, avocado and cherry tomatoes, mixed with hot sauce.   Price - Slightly towards the higher side  Service - Quick  Quality - Very fresh ingredients (can't speak for the frozen items/smoothies, haven't tried those)  Portion size - Generous.  Quick tip: Get a stamp card from the counter. They don't generally offer it. But at the end of it, you could grab yourself a free salad bowl. (Tip courtesy: Tiff L)  P.S. They don't serve the Buddha satay bowl at this location."}
{"text":"Freshii is a small counter-served restaurant located at McCord Hall at the W.P. Carey School of Business on the Arizona State University Tempe Campus. It has tables for two and some outdoor tables, but all the food is served in compost packaging which allows for easy transport elsewhere. Freshii is always busy in the morning and during lunch, but on average I only wait 5 to 10 minutes to get served by their friendly staff. Their menu is varied consisting of salads and wraps, bowls, burritos, soups, frozen yogurt, breakfast, juices and smoothies, breakfast items, and even customized meals that you can create yourself. I love how on their menu they put the calories on each of their menu items.  I found the restaurant to be bright and clean, and the service appropriately quick, but music is sometimes too loud to easily order.  I love the Teriyaki Twist bowl and maybe someday I will try some of their other foods on the menu. It contains edamame, broccoli, green onions, teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, carrots, wontons, brown rice, and cucumbers. I always buy the bowl without the cucumbers since I don't like them.  Freshii gives you the option to add hormone free protein to your meal such as chicken, which is what I prefer. The chicken and broccoli are always cold and the next time I visit I am going to check to see if it can be served hot. On the other hand, the brown rice served with the chicken and broccoli burnt my tongue!  I wish that the carrots were thicker or in greater quantity as the grated carrots they use are few and far between. The green onions are pungent and will affect your breath negatively so I would not recommend ordering them unless you are going straight home or to a place you can brush and gargle.   Receiving the correct order has been a bit of an issue as I have had one occasion where they gave me cucumbers when I specifically requested none, and recently I received no edamame with my meal.    The price of the Teriyaki Twist Bowl is $6.99, and adding the optional chicken increases the price by $1.99.  As much as I enjoy the food, the price of $8.98 plus tax is prohibitive for me as a college student to eat there often.  I wish the price could be lower as not only do I wish to continue eating more organic and hormone-free foods, but I strongly wish to try more of their diverse menu.  On average, most meal choices are going to cost you approximately $10.  It is comforting to come into an eatery where they know you by name, smile, and provide you with a natural, healthy and appealing nutritional fare.  Personally, I would recommend Freshii to anyone who is seeking a healthier diet or more diverse food choices."}
{"text":"Usual Freshii in Rosedale. Nice patio with picnic tables. There's also a White Squirrel coffee shop in the store. Lots of seating inside. North of Rosedale subway station on east side of Yonge. Usually not too busy but it's close to Ramsden Park for a picnic."}
{"text":"I love this Freshii location. I usually grab a wrap after work. They really pile in the toppings(not like most freshii's I've been too) and the service is always friendly. The wraps are super filling and is good for a quick, healthy dinner. The location is convenient too as it is attached to the Finch subway station(building beside) I would definitely recommend this Freshii."}
{"text":"So fresh, was going to buy it for lunch the next day and the food already went bad. Sick now cause I took a bite."}
{"text":"So I just realised freshii was opened and have eaten there to days in a row... I absolutely love the menu and everything I have has has been excellent!!! I totally recommend the Baja burrito my current favorite but I still have a lot to try!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were walking to get our nails done, and bumped into Freshii. I was craving something refreshing and came to the right place. I ordered the Smoothie Bowl and it was very good. Will come back soon 'nn"}
{"text":"Finally! A healthy \"fast food\" restaurant nearby! Great food, smoothies and juices that I feel good about eating. Fun atmosphere in the restaurant too. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"I will also give this place a 3 star rating. I really love how you can design your own dish, but it quickly adds up to be a pricey meal depending on what you want. Its a little inconsistent in taste too...but I guess you have to expect that with custom meals made quickly.   I love the concept and everything else about Freshii...don't get me wrong...but the price is what drags it down. You get huge portions but I'd almost rather get something a little smaller and cheaper."}
{"text":"Quite pricey for a salad and long wait times. Friendly service. Food is pretty good.  They have delivery so I was excited to get healthy food delivered but they don't deliver to Yonge and Eglinton and the location at Yonge and Eglinton doesn't have enough staff working to deliver. What the heck?  This chain is frustrating. It's a good concept but if they're going to offer delivery they shouldn't half ass it."}
{"text":"If you need a healthy quick meal in the area, this is a great spot to go. I usually go here or Craft Burger if I have no time to eat at home as I'm always in this area. Service here was really friendly when I went, both here and Crema attached. It's not really that great, but it's not so bad. Apart from the random limp lettuce leaves in the salad, it's pretty decent. I'd say 3-stars for food, but since I'm in need of healthy food in this area and because the service is friendly, I'd say 4. If you don't have the time to go to a real restaurant, go here."}
{"text":"As Jay K previously mentioned, we have found a bit of inconsistency with the ingredients in the meals we've ordered. Although, Marzena the owner is very friendly and is very passionate about what she does. We are regulars to this location, and are very happy with what we get!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Lots of variety to mix up the bowls. I recommend the pangoa but with a different sauce, such as the Greek yogurt ranch or the green curry.   Making your own bowl is not a very good deal as all the good toppings are premium.   What keeps this place from being a 5 star for me is the fact that the quantity of food in my bowl is inconsistent, as sometimes it's only 2/3 full. The staff is friendly and it's pretty fast. The ingredients are always fresh. For the extra two bucks compared? to a sub, the quality is incomparable."}
{"text":"So good!! Extremely healthy!!! If you are looking for a meal that will fill you, yet also make you feel so refreshed and good about yourself this is the place to go... The service enables the customer to choose and serve them selves as if it is a fast food restaurant... Yet it clearly isn't. The perfect lunch and even dinner I wish that there were more restaurants like these."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, I arrived just before lunchtime. I order the Buddha Satay, with chicken which was made relatively fast. It tasted so tasty when hot. The only negative for me was that they didn't have a big enough range of drinks. The washrooms just like the rest of the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"When I travel for work I always look for real food options.  So glad that Freshii is now open!  Very clean with great service.  I had the Cali bowl for late breakfast.  It is a smoothie base with granola, coconut and tons of fresh fruit.  Kept me happy and full all day. the building and restaurant are very cool with great music as well!  Will definitely come back when I return to the city!"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this Freshii location for a few months now. It is a five-minute drive from my workplace.   I was working on the weekend (ugh!) and needed some lunch. I hit this location and ordered my favourite salad, which is the fiesta salad. I added chicken for added protein.   The fiesta salad consists of field greens, black beans, corn, tomatoes, onions, and avocado, all tossed together in a lime vinagrette. Yum!  I also went with a Freshii green smoothie. I realized after sipping it that it had frozen yogurt. I will order the dairy-free smoothie the next time. I am borderline lactose-intolerant. I was fine after taking my lactase pills.   The food is fresh and tasty. You do spend more for freshness. My salad and smoothie came up to $18.   This location is bright and clean. There are tables and booths there. I elected to do takeout. There was ample parking on a Saturday afternoon.   (122)"}
{"text":"Years ago, when I used to work in Scarborough, I would often come to this plaza with co-workers to either have lunch or do some shopping at No Frills.   Gone is Licks. Starbucks occupies that store. I don't recall what used to be where Freshii is. I am glad that there is one, though! It is one of the closer Freshii locations to where I live.   I visited on a Sunday. I bought a superfood soup and fiesta salad with tofu.   My favourite salad is the fiesta. I love the lime dressing and all the goodness that cones with the salad, including corn and avocados. I prefer the tofu over chicken. You can also get falafel, which I have yet to try.   I tried the superfood soup for the first time. For $7.49, you get a large container of soup filled with quinoa, kale, carrots, and a bunch of other healthy ingredients. It's low in sodium and tastes good. It's filling!  Service was prompt. I did takeout.   If you want healthy food that's tasty and filling, this place is for you. It can seem a bit pricey for salad and soup, but it is worth it to feel good about what you have eaten.   (256)"}
{"text":"This Freshii is kind of blah. I think that's due to the people working here. There's a freshii location near my workplace & their food is much better although its the same chain. I ordered a custom bowl similar to what I've ordered at my workplace Freshii & there was no flavour to the food. The ingredients didn't taste the freshest either. The one at my workplace actually seasons the mushrooms a bit and so you can still have great flavour in a vegetarian rice bowl without using their sauces. I don't think I'll come back here. But it was better than the fast food in the food court at College Park."}
{"text":"I still come here when I want to buy my lunch. I was always buying a custom bowl until I asked the manager if I could modify the Pesto bowl. He said I could so I added some things to that & took others away. That priced out much better than the custom bowl I used to get. I have always gotten good service here and no problems with the food. Proportions have always been good when I buy something here."}
{"text":"Grabbed a snack here in between appointments. I got the spinach, egg, cheese pocket & it was pretty good. It was freshly assembled & looked like the ingredients had just been prepped that morning. Next time I need something more substantial I'll try one of their rice bowls."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, healthy lunch.   I typically just get one of the menu items off the wall but you can they have custom order sheets so you can get whatever you want. Mix and match the different veggies and toppings, or soups and salads.  Not many places to sit and eat in here so i always take my food to go. It's kinda awkward where you order since the window is really small, and they have a drink cooler blocking your view of where they make the food.   If this were a generic greasy fast food place I'd give it 3 stars based on the store and service but the food is great so that more than makes up for the few complaints i have."}
{"text":"Solid food choices with a variety of choices. I like that various diets are easily accommodated and that dishes come with a lot of veggies. Staff is polite and helpful even when one diner wanted a dish with everything separate so they could add items together on their own (aka kid friendly!). Brightly lit and lots of seating and parking is easy."}
{"text":"It is all fresh which I guess makes the name of the place honest at least. If you are looking for health food at an okay price, this is a great place to grab a bite. They have specials and I do recommend them. You need chicken and some sauce to make it interesting else you are just having vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I have been to other Freshii locations before and was happy with them, but I was really disappointed with this location. My first issue. Last week they posted a $5.00 special on an advertising board but upon entering the restaurant I was told that the special was advertised only if I purchased a drink. Not a big deal, but still very misleading.  My 2nd issue, after ordering a salad from a girl working the cash register, my order was quickly put together by another gentleman who obviously did not enjoy working there. After putting my order together and slamming it on the counter, I asked him where I could find a fork and napkin and he just 'pointed'. A good dining experience usually involves good food, great service and a clean restaurant. I will give this place 3 stars for the food, 0 on the service and 1 for cleanliness (hence my 1 star rating) I can't condemn an entire chain for one bad location but if you are visiting Freshii and live or work at King and Church, avoid this location!"}
{"text":"They have nutritious options, but it's not nearly as across-the-board healthy as their marketing would have you believe. There are a few too many calorie and sodium bombs on the menu for a place that's pitching itself as healthy, and for a place that's all like, \"hey our food is healthy!\" they could really stand to put the nutrition information on their menu. Instead they slap a PDF on their website of the whole menu and it's not very easy to navigate on the fly trying to figure out the nutrition info.   For the most part the salads and burritos are alright calorie- and sodium-wise, but the bowls and wraps are like 2/3 your daily intake of sodium. Not sure what they do with the wraps vs. burritos that accounts for the difference. Also the bowls generally have way too much sodium.   I personally am not a smoothie fan because I think yogurt is gnarly, especially in drink form, but if you are one of the legions of people who inexplicably want to drink yogurt (WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?) then be aware that all of these are 400-600 calories.   Personally, I stay away from the wraps, bowls, and smoothies. If you stick to the salads and burritos they're generally decent options. Be careful on the burritos though, because sometimes the cooks make a particularly over-stuffed one. Which is fine, but if my burrito ends up Chipotle size here, I eat about 2/3 of it and save the rest for later."}
{"text":"Salad is not typically a food associated with primeval rage, but if you've ever been charged $11.58 for a salad, you'll know what kind of rage I'm talking about.  Freshii claims to have re-vamped their menu and simplified the ordering process by touting an \"all new Freshii 2.0\" experience, it's a crock of shit and a ripoff is what it is. The menu has been changed in such a way that it's difficult to make out prices.   About a month ago when I ordered a certain salad, I'd get charged around 9 bucks for it.  Now when I order a pretty close facsimile of said salad which stealthily enough is now called a \"Ninja\" salad, I get charged $11 and change!  because apparently the salad now comes in two sizes and simply ordering a salad means they'll automatically ring you up for the LARGER size with the much larger price, without consulting you first!   That's it Freshii!!! Just because you have semi-functioning Asian staff and play shitty Ibiza-style techno music does NOT give you the right to rob me nearly $12 bucks for a fricking salad!"}
{"text":"I have had both a salad and a froyo from here on two separate occasions and just want to warn folks - check your bill and your meal. I was charged the wrong price for the froyo and my salad was missing some ingredients I had requested. I'd like to chalk this up to the place being new but I don't feel inclined to go a third time to find out.   I had the kale salad and found it to be somewhat tasteless. Froyo was serviceable; they are not generous w toppings that's for sure! Prices are on the more expensive side for lunch too. Like I said earlier, likely will not give this place another try."}
{"text":"I popped in here the other day for lunch. I had the Tex Mex burrito. For $8 it was a good size; if you like brown rice, this should be your go to. I personally found it bland, but I could appreciate that the ingredients were decnt quality. The space is clean and bright and the staff were pleasant. So all in all, it was a good alternative to most of the chain fastfood joints in this hood."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered wrong but my first experience at Freshii does not have me wanting to go back. I like the idea of the restaurant and the menu looks exciting and healthy. With lots of vegetarian options, I was excited to order. I decided to order their $6 meal of the day because I really had no clue what to get cause everything looked yummy. It ended up being the Buddha bowl. I asked the person working there what it was and she could barely tell me half of the ingredients. I (for some odd reason) still decided to order it. She and another employee put it together and it didn't look terrible appearance-wise. The taste, however, was very disappointing. The bowl consisted of raw brocoli, red cabbage and carrots served on top of noodles and doused with a warm peanut sauce. I found it to be a really weird dish. The vegetables were cold and the sauce was tasteless and very watery. The bowl it was served in was made out of cardboard which is great for the environment but problematic when the sauce seeped through it and made a mess everywhere. I found the meal to be inedible and ended up giving it to a friend who also didn't like it.   As I said, it is possible I ordered wrong. I may try something else there when I am in a hurry and would like some healthy fast food. The price was really good and the location is convenient.   Food:0/5 Value: 3/5"}
{"text":"I tried the juice cleanse through Freshii and was not disappointed! Easy setup- call the day or a couple of days before you want to start the cleanse; pick up your juices + (giant) salad every morning;  do your juice thang the rest of the day!   The flavors were GREAT and the fact that you didn't need to spend hours every day prepping yourself was awesome. Staff was very willing to walk me through the program and give me tips to make it more bearable. Ending each day on a massive delicious salad made it a lot easier as well. Price was slightly high, but reasonable compared to other juice cleanse programs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"College Park boasts no lack of quick, cheap lunch options. The trick is to find something healthy in between plates of Chinese food, philly cheese steaks, jerk chicken dinners and newborn-sized veal sangweeches.   Located right on College, just west of Yonge, this should be a prime location for a chain you'd think would cater to local office workers, of which there are plenty, since much of the real estate is occupied by Ontario government Ministries.   Maybe this location presumes too much of it's allegedly captive audience. Maybe the salarymens' salad expectations are low.   In any case, a single visit renders this Freshii outpost a one-and-done proposition, and makes me leery of ever visiting this chain again.   When Freshii first opened (as \"Lettuce\"), they offered huge salads with bright, crispy veg, fun dressings and ample amounts of protein and toppings of dubious nutritional value. Over time, portions have declined and the bright young things that manned the counter have been replaced by the same fast food lifers who bungle my order at just about every Tim Hortons or McDonalds or Pizza Pizza in town.   Most galling, in an effort to squeeze profit like so much wheatgrass juice, they eliminated the protein from their salads/wraps/burritos. A Cobb or \"Buffalo Chicken\" salad now costs about $6, but without chicken. Let's allow that the process...a buffalo chicken anything, for which the chicken costs extra. I haven't placed my order yet, and my blood pressure has started to rise.   Ordering is disorganized; prospective diners mill about until a brave soul ventures forth to request food. Repeatedly. Including the following exchange:  CUSTOMER: \"I'd like that with chicken, please\" STAFF: \"Tuna?\" CUSTOMER: \"No, chicken\" STAFF: \"Shrimp?\" CUSTOMER: \"Chicken\" STAFF: \"Shrimp?\" CUSTOMER: \"Chicken\" STAFF: \"SHRIMP!\"  Perhaps staff are trained in the Seth McFarlane tradition of beating a joke into the ground?  Food arrives when it arrives. In this case, a noodle bowl and a \"wrap\".  The \"wrap\" arrives without protein, meaning it's mostly wilted greens drowning in sweet dressing, vomiting forth from a stale, disintegrating tortilla.Adding insult to injury, it's not so much a \"wrap\" as a \"clumsy half-ass fold\" which falls apart nearly instantly, transforming to its most entropic state...\"salad\" or maybe just \"mess\".   The bowl benefits from having a bottom and sides to keep the mediocrity in place. At the bottom of the bowl are a few squares of unadulterated, unseasoned tofu, and peanut sauce that's more Skippy than Siam. Plopped on top are a handful of gummy, heated, unseasoned rice noodles, and on top of that a riot of veg, which would be great but for the fact that it's all freezer-cold and similarly naked.   It's all edible, but that's as far as I'll go.   Lunch concludes with a vow to find better salad in greener pastures. What-a-Bagel nearby offers a salad bar complete with a Cobb salad that includes chicken in the price.   Or screw it. We'll just go to Banh Mi Boys."}
{"text":"Of all the Freshii locations in the city this one has the most consistently fresh food. Their spicy lemon grass soup is outstanding. There are so many vegetarian options and you can now add kale as a base to soups so there are even more diet friendly choices. Also new on the menu are falafel balls and tahini salad dressing. The food has gotten better here in general over the past two years. Freshii used to be called lettuce and all their dressings were homemade and outstanding. I still miss the avocado dressing! Then they used Renee's salad dressings or some prepackaged brand and I stopped eating there for a few years but it's gotten good again."}
{"text":"If I get chicken and bacon and cheese added to the baja wrap, am I just mangling a healthy freshii meal into a sloppy Pita Pit experience?  Probably, but je ne care pas."}
{"text":"I love Freshii!   Where to start?  Service. I have always had pleasant service here. Very fast, too!   Food. Yum. Yum. And its healthy! So many flavorful options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I could go on and on about some of my favorites. Some dishes are better than others.  I love the Budda's Satay bowl! Anything with that peanut sauce is to die for.   Today I went and got the spicy lemongrass soup. SO GOOD. Seriously, it is so yummy and flavorful. It has the right amount of spice and is perfect on a winter day.   I'm not crazy about the buffalo sauce and the ranch, so I try to avoid those dishes. I haven't been here for breakfast, but that is definitely on the agenda!   Definitely worth a try if you are looking for healthy fast options!"}
{"text":"This is another place I absolutely love, I often get my lunch here. Healthy eaters will love this place!  They do fantastic custom salads, there is a list of about 20 free ingredients and a list of \"premium\" ingredients which cost between 50 cents and $2 or so.  There are also 15 different dressings to select from and you can specify how much you want (regular amount, half, double, or dressing on the side) So salad combinations are endless ;)  A huge salad with no premium toppings comes to about $7. My only moan is that the premium toppings do add up. Although tasty, paying $12-13 for a takeaway salad seems a little ridiculous to me!  I do love their monthly punch cards. My boss often sends me out to pick up lunch for 4-5 people, and the staff at Freshii are always happy to punch my card once for each salad/wrap/bowl I buy. This accumulates to a free meal for me every week or so.   There are only a few stools to sit down at so your best bet is to queue up, buy your food and take it back to the office or eat it in the Yorkville square around the corner if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to get some snacks. We ordered the spicy lemongrass soups. The cashier was super nice and friendly. She said that is their popular dish!  We couldn't wait to try it!    The soups we ordered came quick! Let me tell you guys, the soups tastes great!!!  I'm glad this little joint is near by our place. I would love to try their burritos and salads next time.  We will definitely come back here for quick snacks: lunch."}
{"text":"The disgusting part was after people returned their finished bowls, the lady used her gloved hands to pick-up/move the bowls, including sticking half her hand inside the bowl and half outside to grab the bowl. She then didn't change her gloves when preparing the next order, so the dressings/gravy/remnants from the finished person's food were now going in the next person's food."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Made my own custom bowl for around $10.00 which was a decent price. However, the service was horrible. They don't seem to really care and just take your order. Don't know what exactly is going on with your day but it's not that hard to give decent customer service."}
{"text":"I went here the other day.  Regarding taste and atmosphere, it is similar to most Freshii locations.  The staff were really friendly though, and that makes a big difference.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out to see what its all about. Overpriced menu, bland,  tasteless. I wont eat here Again. Healthy food does not have to be tasteless!"}
{"text":"I stopped here today for a quick healthy lunch. I remember eating at Freshii's when I visited Houston a few months ago and enjoyed it so i was excited to see this healthy alternative to fast food in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Fiesta wrap with falafel and really enjoyed it. I was thinking that it would be warm but was cold but it tasted great. Had veggies, black beans, avocado, corn and tomato and a cilantro lime dressing. Enough to be satisfied but not feel full and heavy. Can't wait to try some of the breakfast options I saw on the menu the next time I come here."}
{"text":"Not bad. Everyone complains about the employees, sure they seem at first a little disengaged, but can you blame them? Think of All the little brat sorority girls that give their order to them without even looking up from their phone. They probably didn't grow up the same way and may not get how the modern generation can be so self centered.... Just saying.   As for the food, it's good. Not chipotle by any means but it's a great stop if you are in a rush to clash and need some grub."}
{"text":"Fast, great service and great options! I had a green smoothie and it was very good. I look forward to trying some other options!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves this place! And I've grown to love it too! The wraps are freshly made salads and everything else! The smoothies are definitely worth the money and the staff are friendly in loving everything about this spot  It's super clean and the environment and vibe is positive. Eating healthy isn't cheap tho, got a wrap, a salad for my girlfriend, a smoothie came close to $30 lol   A great spot to get something healthy on the go and it's close by my place. Coming back here again and again and again"}
{"text":"I do not like Freshii at all, and I don't understand the people who go here to grab lunch. The food is absolutely flavourless, bland and overpriced. I've gotten the smokehouse burrito with chicken. The chicken is gross - it tastes like some frozen pieces of chicken that are premade, thawed and then put in the burritos. There was so much rice and not much else. Really skimpy on the meat. My biggest problem is just how stinking bland the food is. \"Healthy\" food does not have to be bland if seasoned properly and the proper sauces are used. The smokehouse burrito is supposed to have a spicy yogurt sauce, but I swear you can't taste it at all. I had to load the hot sauce on.   I might go back and try something else if they have another 50% deal like they did in the summer. It's pretty unlikely I would ever pay full price for the food here when there are a lot of tastier options, equally as healthy, for the same price."}
{"text":"I see a lot of potential with Freshii. I would give them 5 stars if they weren't too shy with the seasoning in some food items like flavorless rice or the parfaits."}
{"text":"First time here and the experience was soooo bad. I'm not one to give bad reviews but if I can stop someone from wasting there precious dollars on this place I will. We waited for an hour for food that ended up being completely wrong. They forgot our chicken. The noodles were super under cooked. The shop was out of everything (even lids for the containers) food and garbage was everywhere. There was a man working (owner/manager?) That was barking orders at all the young women that were working there. I was really looking forward to trying this place out but the experience was so awful I honestly wanted to Frisby my food across the park as soon as I stepped out of the store. But I didn't because I am a lady! NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the juices but the food is reasonable, healthy, and delicious! Love the teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"I like this place. I go there frequently...healthy and good food... With lots of options. Fast and friendly. However utterly confusing first time there, the little form you have to fill out if you want to \"build\" your own salad is crap (several times I have managed to cross out the wrong thing and wind up getting a wrap when I really wanted a salad... and I am not THAT slow...they need to redesign that thing!). Dont think about sitting down during busy hours! Not cheap.. I will continue to go there though given its a fast and healthy option.  UPDATE: they have launched some kind of new concept there (Bay/Bloor)...Its  a mess.. clearly the new ordering process doesnt work very well. Salad is good, some ingredients are even better, but they have taken away stuff like bread etc."}
{"text":"I've walked by many of the Freshii restaurants but I managed to pop in to try their food. This location opened recently right by my work so I stopped in a last week to try it out and I've become a fan - been back like 3 times now!  As the name implies, Freshii is focused on healthy salads, wraps, burritos, bowls and soups with smoothies. I have tried the following ones:  Fiesta salad wrap - loved the combo of black beans, salsa and avocado with mixed greens!  Smokehouse burritto - this was a winner - the combo of rice, beans, tomatoes mixed with cheddar was great. Even they say the sauce is a yogurt - it tasted like a BBQ sauce - great flavors and not too heavy.  Spicy thai - this was so-so for me as I found the quinoa in the burrito to be a bit too loose. Also the sauce was actually a bit spicier than I thought. Generally flavour was good but my other choices were better before.  So far, I like the place quite a bit and I will have to try their salads and bowls which look to be huge!"}
{"text":"I really like their rice bowls and salads. I tried two different rice bowls, my favorite was the Oaxaca.   What I was very impressed with though, was their three day juice cleanse. I called 24 hours in advance to tell them I wanted to buy a juice cleanse the next morning. It was $80 which translates to about $26 a day for four fresh juices & one metaboost salad, which is very good.  On day one I was hungry! I got a headache and was feeling a little dizzy. But from the literature and research that I did this was not because of lack of food. This was because my body was detoxing all the fat, sugar, wheat, salt and toxins that we are used to ingesting every day!   I wasn't looking forward to the second day at all but it was the best. I felt lighter, I had more energy, I could see clearly, I guess all of the energy that my body was putting into digesting food was now going into my brain, my skin, my hair, my other body cells and organs.  The third day! For me, it was good. I felt happy, had lots of energy and feeling light is a luxurious feeling. I had slept well and I totally recommend this cleanse for those who are healthy otherwise.   The staff here is very nice. The girl told me if I was very hungry I was allowed fruit and raw vegetables; a very helpful hint. The owners are a young couple who did a good job every time I came in to pick up my food and juice for the day.   Keep up the good work Freshii!"}
{"text":"Freshii is where you can get an easy and fresh post workout meal. Finally there is a place for me to get a wheat free salad or rice bowl with fresh vegetables, seasonings, complex carbs and protein.   What I like is that most things are listed as vegetarian. You can add protein as you wish. You can add chicken, steak, tuna... Or falafel or tofu for additional charges.   Today I decided on a rice bowl. I ordered the Pangoa, which is brown rice, avocado, black beans, aged cheddar, corn, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, lime wedge and after talking to the owner I substituted the fiery barbeque sauce for peanut sauce. Since I ordered the bowl to go he gave me some spicy lemon grass sauce to try. It was very good.  The bowl was fresh, satisfying and fairly priced in my opinion. It wasn't a small size, it wasn't a large portion either, but it cost $7.86 after tax and that sounded about right. I will come again to try the other bowls, perhaps some of the detox and energy juices."}
{"text":"I make excuses to go to Provigo around dinner time so I can stop off at Freshii on the way back.  I love the concept of healthy fast food, and I have a \"thing\" for their Ninja Wrap.  It's an Asian burrito, with brown rice, lots of veggies, teriyaki sauce and edemame.  I usually add the optional tofu because that's how I roll.  (Disclaimer #1:  I once had a cat named Tofu, so just saying the name makes me nostalgic.  Disclaimer #2:  I think Edemame is a good cat name, too.  Any takers?)    The staff are young, energetic and not jaded.  There is no tip cup, so I make it a point to be complimentary to the staff in lieu of showing my appreciation with a Loonie."}
{"text":"It's always good to have healthy options. If you're a vegan/vegetarian or just want to eat something freshly made in front of you, then you'll love this place. The place has a nice patio, but seats are limited. I had a Baja Burrito and it sure tasted healthy. You always have the option of adding a protein item (ie: chicken, beef, or tofu) at an extra cost."}
{"text":"Freshii is a small eatery at the corner of Richmond St. and Spadina that focuses on a range of health food products. For the record, I've only tried a green smoothie which tasted pretty darn good for $6. I was considering adding banana to it for the sake of sweetness, but the price went up by almost $3 (so I backed out, of course).  It's a very clean space that is decorated in an inviting, modern style. Service wasn't particularly good but wasn't bad either. I'd come back for sure, because I'm on a smoothie kick lately and I need options for the different areas of town I'm usually around. If I happen to sample the food offerings, I'll update my review. Otherwise, Freshii seems like a middle tier, reliable place to grab a healthy snack, nothing fancier than that."}
{"text":"Freshii is truly great! It is conveniently located just north of Sherbrooke, on avenue du Parc. The restaurant itself has limited seating, but I prefer to get takeout anyway.   The service is always quick and very friendly. The food is amazing! I usually just customize my own meal, which I would 100% recommend. They also have a variety of options on their menu. Prices are very reasonable, although your meal can become expensive if you add-on multiple things.   Overall, this restaurant is awesome. It's perfect for any meal or even for a snack. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout from there today for lunch, and I was not too impressed. First of all they were so busy with a long lineup, yet they were understaffed at the front, and when things started getting real busy, then more staff members started coming out from the back, if you have the staff why don't you let them do some work and assist at the front. It took me over 30 minutes to pick up one salad.  I got a Cobb salad with chicken, the portion is generous, but the quality wasn't anything special, I have tried other Freshii location that was great, and this wasn't any good.  I will not return again unfortunately"}
{"text":"Like this place.  Good salads and wraps but a little pricey. I have been using the order ahead function on their app however it rarely works and you end up waiting anyway.   Best options are buffalo chicken wrap, fiesta wrap, Mediterranean salad. Turkey chili is also good when it is in season."}
{"text":"Yummy in mah tummy.  I had the teriyaki burrito.  It was a great size and wasn't too filling.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  This is a grab-n-go location as they only have 4-5 seats at a bar to sit at.  The staff were friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Freshii since I lived in Toronto over 4 years ago. Things have changed a little. This location, as per most, is small with a limited amount of seating but it's brand new so everything is nice and shiny.  I went with the buffalo chicken salad. A little on the boring side. Also I asked for goat cheese instead of blue and I got cheddar. Maybe they don't have goat cheese, but either way, it's not what I asked for. The staff all seemed a little aloof, like we were making them have to work.  Don't know if I'll come back to this location now that there is one on 130th Ave."}
{"text":"Food= delicious and healthy  Staff= unhappy. As if zombies were serving. Put on a smile people!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the salads from Freshii. They are, surprise surprise, fresh, and they have tons of topping options and combis. They could use more dressings and can be a bit stingy with the protein helpings but maybe I'm comparing them to my generous-handed home salad creations.  This sad rating is for their broths. I ordered the classic chicken broth to warm myself up and eat light. You are allowed two veggies so I added edamame and bean sprouts for a little crunch and texture.   NOT ONE PIECE OF CHICKEN IN THIS SOUP. I don't know if that's normal or I am just very unlucky, but it was so disappointing. Mama always said a meal without meat is a snack (sorry vegetarians, by that ruling you are perma-snackers) so this was so UNsatisfying, albeit healthy.   Who knew you had to ask for chicken in your chicken broth.   Sigh.   I RECOMMEND- sticking to salads   EXTRA TIP- Pricey- 8.69 or more for salads before tax. Small broths more reasonably priced at 2.50 before taxes."}
{"text":"The frozen yogurt is great especially when you having it with a friend!  Would not comment on the services since the 2 girls are kind of indifference.. no welcome, no thank you...no smile...  The yogurt toppings selections is great! I have the blueberry and mango and the fruits are both fresh.  You sure that it is really LOW FAT?? Or it is a trick?? This tastes so rich and yummy!"}
{"text":"I am like 90% sure I got food poisoning from this place. Their \"chicken\" is that gross looking/cold/chewy chicken that you can usually find on airport salads, it tasted off when I ate it. I really wanted to like this place as it is walking distance from my apartment. The place itself also smells bad like mothballs. Did not have a great experience. I believe I paid close to 18/19 dollars for the salad. Expensive and not good - no thank you..."}
{"text":"I love this chain. Lettuce Eatery has taken everything I could dream of in a \"fast food\" joint, and made it reality.  They serve salads, wraps, rice bowls and soups. You write your choices down on a paper, customize what you want, pay for the extras you want or just get the basics you need, and your order is made. You can get the salads delivered to you! You can fax them an order form that you've filled out! You can call ahead so it's ready for your lunch break!  I would kill to work closer to a location of the Lettuce Eatery, so that I could eat delicious vegetables everyday. I'm OK with the size of their salads -- besides the dressing, I really doubt that anything bad can come of someone overdosing on leaves. I'd rather fill myself on salad than french fries, and I can always save some for later in their cute little salad bowls that I love re-using.  The one downfall of this place is that you can go overboard on the extras, and your salad/wrap/bowl can end up in the $14-$16 range, which is a little bit ridiculous. Stick to basics and you'll be in the $6 range, which is much better for the bank account.  Also what's up with the names of their food? Freshii bowl? Yoggi? Soup't? Kinda lame, and you might feel like a two-year-old when you order the \"Yoggi\". But it's worth it...I will sound like a fool for the convenience and efficiency of Lettuce Eatery."}
{"text":"Love the low-fat yogurt with 2 free toppings( we chose blueberries and almonds). It was so good!!! Teriyaki chicken was just okay and powerhouse smoothies was great"}
{"text":"Freshii has recently made its way to the GTA opening several stores in the area. The new Freshii which is located in the plazas outside of Vaughan Mills is the one i went to. It's in the corner of the plaza with the supermarket. The environment is clean and bright with the people working looking very friendly. You basically just pick up your food and can sit on the tables inside the restaurant. I've already had lunch so I opt out of the food and just went for one of their smoothies. I've heard great things about the store and was excited to try it out. I ordered the \"Freshii Green\" smoothie which consists of kale, spinach, pineapple, avocado and low fat frozen yogurt.   The smoothie was rather expensive. It came to about $6.75 after tax which I was fine with but when I got it, it was a lot smaller than I have imagined. It tasted rather sweet though, a taste I would rather have than a sour taste which is what I feel like the Jugo Juice mighty kale tastes like. Even with the expensive price tag, I really enjoyed the smoothie but I'm not sure if I would get it again. I would visit again just to try out some of their foods such as their bowls and salads. This brand new place is giving Vaughan a few more healthier options."}
{"text":"I don't know what they did to the menu at this freshii but it is not the same as the menu you can get from other locations or what is listed online.  My off-the-menu salad was overdressed and had minimal toppings.  I've had good experiences elsewhere so I might give it another shot for a bowl or something, but overall was not impressed."}
{"text":"Loved the Bangkok wrap, delicious.  I will definitely be back. Great healthy options."}
{"text":"In terms of healthy lunch options in Toronto FiDi, Freshii is average and therefore priced appropriately. I've had the Mediterranean bowl with grilled chicken, and although the ingredients taste fresh, it doesn't compare to the more complex combinations at iQ. The bowl itself is a heartier portion, and I like the addition of roasted red peppers and olives. Ultimately, it's a refreshing lunch, but nothing particularly memorable."}
{"text":"Ridiculously over-priced wraps ($15 for a small wrap and a drink). The problem is that the menu shows that the wraps are $8-10 each, but that's BEFORE you add any meat. Depending on what you add (chicken, pork, beef) that's another $2-3 onto your bill. The service was quite flat and it took a long time for this being an airport, where quick service is essential."}
{"text":"Supervised by the short line during the lunch rush. Menu was simple as easy to read. Selected a bowl with protein. Bowl was fresh and tasty but a little overpriced considering I could get a comparable bowl for $2 less at comparable places. I've had the revitalize smoothie which was fantastic. Perfect blend of flavors. Looking forward to trying other items on my next visit."}
{"text":"A bit pricey. Ordered the spicy lemongrass soup and a beet juice and it was $17. The soup was not spicy and was a tad bland. The juice was good but very small for the price."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous amounts of Freshii locations and this is by far the best. It's located in the main intersection of Weston/Highway 7 and it's in a plaza with a lot of options to eat.  The staff is usually always courteous and competent and are pretty quick in making your food.  This location always seems to give you more for your money as they stuff the bowl which is always awesome! Try out the Bamboo bowl or the Oaxaca bowl and you definitely won't be disappointed! It's definitely always fresh at Freshii!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a voucher to try this place out and I didn't present the voucher until my food was fully prepared so I could get a taste of what a real customer would taste.  The ordering system is confusing if you haven't been there before since there are no signs to direct you. You can choose their pre-made salads/soups/bowls/wraps which are absurdly expensive because they are filled with \"premium\" ingredients like Cajun Chicken. I ordered the Warrior Chicken with brown rice. It was very bland, contained little chicken and overpriced. It was listed as one of their best sellers amusingly. If I were to review this place based on that alone, I would've given it one star.  However, I also ordered a custom salad that was far more reasonably priced because I chose only the \"unlimited\" ingredients that weren't extra-charged. I ordered a plethora of vegetables and fruits on it and salad was absolutely massive. I'd say it's a good deal all in all especially considering it's relatively healthy and the ingredients were fresh and plentiful (mandarin oranges, spinach, celery, broccoli, green apple slices, etc). There are so many free ingredient options too! The cesar dressing was adequate on the salad so it wasn't bland at all, and I only ordered the normal amount of dressing. You can choose to get extra dressing for free.  All in all, if you go here, I'd suggest the custom-made items so you can price it out however you like and make it however you like. There are certainly a lot of options."}
{"text":"I ordered the Oaxaca bowl. Everything was very fresh and the portion was big. I especially like the diversity of vegetables and the yogurt sauce which matches the ingredients well. Much better than some salad places where you spend $10 for a Caesar salad without meat."}
{"text":"I LOVE Freshii and I don't understand why the line isn't out the door every time I visit.  The vegetarian options are abundant and the best thing about Freshii is that all of the items on the menu are considerably healthy. Why has this concept not caught on with other restaurants?  Their menu consists of many suggested bowls and wraps, all with different toppings and sauces. You can make a custom wrap or bowl, with everything ranging from tofu to sriracha to greens. One of my favorite menu items is the Buddha bowl.  They also have smoothies, which are quite good. The green smoothie is both healthy and quite delicious, so I normally splurge for it (they're upwards of $5 each).  There's quite a bit of tables in the dining room and the staff have been friendly on every visit thus far. The place is clean and bright too!  Now if only it were closer to downtown..."}
{"text":"I recently moved to a new neighbourhood and have been seeking out more affordable options to grab food from. If I'm not mistaken, is this what the former \"Lettuce Eatery\" has been rebranded as? Anyway it looks super similar to me, and it's just as delicious either way!   They have a bunch of different options from salads to rice bowls to burritos. You grab a little clipboard and check off what kinds of things you want included and then they make it for you. Or you can choose one of the suggested combinations from the menu. I've tried a salad and a rice bowl and wasn't disappointed. They were both pretty tasty and healthy.   But what really has me going back to this place far too often is their frozen yogurt! They have a variety of toppings from fresh mango to \"vanilla chips\" and it's fairly inexpensive.   Also if you work in retail and show them your nametag/ID or uniform you can get 10% off!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the problem is with the incredibly slow and rude service. Of all the locations I've been to, this one is by far the worst. They barely acknowledge you when you walk in, and you're looking at a minimum 20 minute wait for any of the bowls. Was excited for this to open, not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Freshii never fails to disappoint. The prices may look deceiving, but the portion sizes are HUGE. I ordered chicken teriyaki bowl with A LOT of substitutions (I was kind of embarrassed, but whatever). I basically had a custom bowl but the staff were super understandable and willingly made the substitutions for me :) So if you really hate those crispy wontons, don't be afraid to trade them out for something you love! (CORN!!!!)   I was also pretty thirsty and the staff kindly poured me a cup of water. Didn't have to buy an overpriced plastic bottle which was nice !  What I love about freshii is that the ingredients taste so real. I know some similar places opt for canned chicken, preserved vegetables, and other funky things to keep costs low... glad to know some places still value quality at reasonable prices!  Overall, the meal was wholesome, satisfying, and re(freshii)ng (aha see what I did there). Thanks to the staff here for being so accommodating with my demands"}
{"text":"Picked up a Buddha's Satay Bowl to go. The noodles were overlooked and congealed in a mass at the bottom of the bowl. They may have prepped the bowl in advance, as the noodles had stuck to the cardboard... I ended up eating part of the bottom of the box!   Cabbage was dried out and browned on the edges. I'm fairly certain the broccoli is brought in frozen as it was very cold. Pre-packaged sauce was flavourless.   I've had good experiences with Freshii in the past, so that's why I chose to pick up food here. The staff ignored me until I managed to make eye contact with one of them. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Freshii finally opened! It's a great alternative for anyone who is looking for a healthier lunch option outside of the typical fast food joints. You can choose from their signature salads, bowls, and wraps or build your own if you want something more customized.  I ordered the market salad with tofu which was amazing. I would definitely recommend. All protein comes with an upcharge of a few dollars. All the ingredients are fresh and high quality. I'm obsessed with the honey dijon dressing. Portion sizes are reasonable, but I was hungry again soon after.   The only downside is that their hours are very limited. They're only open until 5pm on weekdays and closed on weekends."}
{"text":"I ordered their Superfood Soup Bowl through Uber Eats. While it was a big portion, I found it extremely bland and overpriced!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered this for lunch at work through skipthedishes .. the Pangoa bowl is to die for -- expect that strong hotdog/ketchup smell coming from it.. Will definitely return or order again to try other items"}
{"text":"I think overall I like Freshii. I mean I feel like a lot of the items on the menu I could easily make at home, but that's not convenient.  I always get the lemongrass noodle soup (or whatever the formal name for that is). I think the broth is super good and they always give ample vegetables and noodles. Once I ordered it with chicken and I was not disappointed.  The smoothies here are also excellent. In Chicago, I think Freshii made their smoothies with frozen kefir. I think here in Madison it's just frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"I stop in at Freshii a couple times a week. It's quick easy and delicious. All The food is healthy. More importantly for me many of the items are vegan. It's tough to eat fast food as a vegan and this is a great option for a vegan on the go."}
{"text":"I do not like this place. Tried the bangkok and warrior chicken.  I have to admit they have very cool names, but bleh."}
{"text":"I dunno why they keep putting chicken in my vegan bowl. I ordered tofu but there are always chicken in it. It happened for the second time!!!!! Very disrespectful when I took the food out and found out there's chicken that I don't eat in my food.wont be back here ever again. I would put 0 if there's an option."}
{"text":"I came in for a smoothie.  There was no one else there besides a quiet couple in the corner already eating.  I ordered and paid.  One staff member did the cash register and the other one made the smoothie -- SLOWLY.   After paying, everyone just kind of stood there for 30 seconds and I thought maybe no one was going to make my order.  I looked around and saw a juicer.  The girl s-l-o-w-l-y made her way over.  She leaned over to the recipe lists posted on the wall by the machine and inspected the one for the smoothie I'd ordered.   After studying it, she moved a dirty stepladder stool out of her way, touched her hair, opened a big food cover thing, and started full on grabbing handfuls of veggies and shoving them into the machine -- GROSS.  Not only did it take forever, but it was unsanitary as well.  Eventually she finished and handed it to me -- it was warm.  I took a tiny sip just to get a taste, in case I came across another location one day and wanted to try it again.  It was awful."}
{"text":"I really love that a place like this exists in Madison, especially away from downtown where the only fast food options are otherwise decidedly unhealthy.  Freshii smelled good walking in the door and didn't disappoint.  Walking up to the counter the employees were friendly and helpful, taking me through their three main options (wraps, bowls, burritos).  There's quite a few choices within each category, but they had a few suggestions ready when I asked for guidance.  They explained to me that all the dishes start vegetarian but that you can add meat if interested.  I was starting to work up a thirst too so they showed me the smoothies and juices.  I settled on a Tex Mex burrito (brown rice, black beans, corn, avocado, aged cheddar, pico de gallo, salsa) and a Green Energy Juice (apple, cucumber, kale, lemon, carrot, romaine, spinach) based on their suggestions.  The juice price irk'd me a bit at $6, but I like to give new things a chance so I stomached that cost this time around.  The result?  Let's just say it's probably an acquired taste, and while I'm sure some of the other juices are a bit more accessible, the green energy one was too earthy for my palate.  The Burrito on the other hand was excellent.  Great size, nice grill marks, well packed, and like the name of the place says - very fresh.  Two bites in I could tell it was a lot better than the usual fare from the likes of Chipotle and Qdoba, and I loved the smattering of ingredients as well as the fact that there were so many other options to try in the future.  I had just had Chipotle a few days earlier and am growing increasingly bugged by the fact that they skimp on the portions these days and don't have any innovation.  Freshii gives you what you paid for.  Speaking of cash-money, that's the one thing Freshii could improve on.  I get it, fresh ingredients.  But if you want to convince patrons that this is a reasonable alternative to the unhealthy competition there needs to be a little bridging the gap.  my Burrito with chicken and a juice was $16, which is a far cry from the $9-10 at Chipotle for similar items.  Like I said before, you get an upgrade for that price, but certainly something to improve on.  Or maybe just skip the juice.  Quit killing yourself on that fried food next door, and come here to feast on delicious vegetables"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service today. Ordered a Pangoa bowl and Cobb salad. I left and went home, and the Pangoa had no teriyaki sauce. I went back and they just added the sauce. Brought it back home again and then my gf didn't eat it cuz now the rice was cold. They should have offered to make a new one but because the store was almost closing he didn't.  I now go to eat my Cobb salad and then there was no hard boiled egg. I understand mistakes happen but to both orders?!  Pay attention! The lack of care just makes me dislike this place, well this location anyways."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Low quality. I got a Frozen Yogurt that was filled to the brim and had a lid on it. It was already dripping by the time I got it. The water also tastes like sink water yet it was from a soda fountain. The Freshii green smoothie isn't too bad but was hesitant after having the yogurt (which I didn't even finish by the way)."}
{"text":"This food here is amazing. I'm always super indecisive when I order,  because everything is just so good and fresh! The bowls and wraps are my faves. The Oaxaca- sub the wontons for cilantro and leave off the yogurt sauce ( get cilantro lime vinaigrette) to make it vegan :)"}
{"text":"I like most of Freshii's products, but this isn't the best location to sample them. They actually ran out of rice (!) for their rice bowls. The service here is functional but not friendly at all. Seating is either at a counter at a window or a communal picnic-style table in the centre, so not the most comfortable arrangement if you wanna decompress and get away from everything. But I love their Pangoa Bowl, and it's good here with nice portions. There is a clean washroom available to use and this location has never been busy during my visits. I'd come.back here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Summary: a cheap, fast healthy eating option Recommend: oxcada bowl, budda bowl with brown rice instead of noodle  Freshii was a popular healthy food spot. It was on the cheap end of healthy food. I ate at this place for lunch many times since it was close to my company. The portion was average, and the food quality was OK. Recommend to eat here if you want a light lunch under $10."}
{"text":"I used to order from Freshii online (through their website then subsequently through the Ritual app). They were fine, till they messed up my order last year by not including an item I paid extra for - luckily Ritual issued me a refund and apologized on their behalf. Since then I haven't ordered from them, but decided to give them another chance today - yet again they did not include an item I paid extra for. It's not that hard to re-check items that customers paid extra for. Needless to say, I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I eat here nearly everyday! Everything tastes and smells fresh and it's pretty affordable on a college student budget! I recommend going when they first open and 11 instead of 12-2 for lunch as it gets pretty crowded but they are still timely even when there are a lot of people!"}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked to see all of the negative reviews on here. I had a wonderful experience at this location when I was there on Friday with my sister. I've never had freshii so fresh and so good. The cashier and cook was super friendly and accommodating. The place was clean and welcoming. I'll post some pics of what we ordered. I hate that freshii is so expensive, but it's not the fault of the location. Absolutely wonderful experience"}
{"text":"My first and last time at freshii. There was a ladybug in my bowl and overall my meal was just not good."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this location.  The salad I had tasted so fresh and was delicious!  I'll be coming back here for sure.  My whole experience here was great and the staff was very friendly!  Thanks Freshii!"}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced and coupon Nazis. Went once, won't be back. Guessing it will be gone soon."}
{"text":"I love the Cobb wrap so much.  Anytime I'm hungry it's all I want.  I am so in love with freshii. I have been to 4 locations in Calgary and it's by far the best place to grab a healthy meal.  The staff are always so amazing.  The places are all so clean and it's so filling.   It's like I dreamed of this place and it became reality :). Keep doing a great job !"}
{"text":"Freshii. Did you know this is an international chain? I didn't until I just now checked out their slick website. I do not enjoy dining at this place, but I respect it very much... a little less so now that I know it's a chain.  They have a stream-lined ordering system, wherein you grab one of their super-adorable clip boards and tiny bowling-style pencils and check off the things you want in your soup and/or salad. My fave item of theirs is building a noodle soup from their spicy* lemongrass broth.   Despite popular belief, this place is not strictly veggie, and they have chicken options. They are all all about the greens, though, with about 1,000 salad options once you really think about all the ways to mix and match. I find most of their food bland and overpriced but a lot of folks are gaga for Freshii, and I'm definitely impressed by their business model.  Bottom line, $12 for a salad is just too much.   PEPPER POINTS: For having corn as an option to throw in the salad. Love me a slight crunch.   *Not at all spicy."}
{"text":"Once upon at time I worked very close to this take-away Freshii location. After separating myself from lunching here a little too often, I can now think of it fondly.   I  am a big fan of building extravagant chicken and rice bowls. If you do it carefully, you can actually escape with a very healthy and cheap lunch. I was never wild for their smoothies, but perhaps I will give them a go again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to pick something up for lunch and it is really good. Lots of interesting, healthy choices. Wraps, burritos, soups, salads and bowls. I have always said healthy fast food would do well in Madison, I hope they do. I had the Club wrap (you can also get all wraps as salads) and added tofu. Everything is vegetarian and then you add protein for an additional charge. My wrap came to a total of $10, but it was a large portion, and quality ingredients so well worth it. My only disappointment was I thought they put way too much honey dijon dressing on, but next time I will order it light on the dressing. The interior is bright, clean and industrial looking. All employees were pleasant and my to go order was prepared in minutes."}
{"text":"I love Freshii. I hate this location. Twice I have ordered ahead of time through Skip the Dishes for pick up. Both times my order has not been ready. What is the point of ordering ahead of time? I ordered a rice bowl with chicken. Paid for feta, had one bite of it in the whole bowl. Bit into a piece of chicken and it was pure gristle. I wasnt super happy with the meal but kept eating since I paid $15. On one of my very last bites, I pull out a long black hair.  As I proceed to barf in my mouth, I hop on Yelp to read the reviews for this location. After seeing how another Yelper was treated by the owner (telling her to shut her mouth and calling her a stupid woman--real nice, dude), I will never ever spend my money at this location again. Piece of advice for the owner: get over your sexist bullshit and realize you are not in charge here. The consumer has a choice and I will make sure every single person I know in this city will never spend a dime in your store again. I look forward to the day I see a Vacant sign hanging in this location's window."}
{"text":"Worst Freshii experience ever.  There were about 5 or 6 people behind the counter and food was taking about 10 to 15  minutes. No team efficiency or communication between team members. Everyone was just doing their own thing and sadly there was no sense of pride in their work or any customer service.  They ran out of rice and substituted the bowls with quinoa free of charge which was nice but then my bowl had no sauce. My boyfriend's bowl had the wrong ingredients and measly serving of tofu.   I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Love how you can modify your own salad (there's other options beside salads too). I really enjoyed their vinegrette dressing. Will definitely come back again,"}
{"text":"I've eaten here and had take out a number of times and it's always been totally as expected. Will eat here again, no question."}
{"text":"had the very very unfortunate opportunity to deal with this business at 6:00am and got chewed out by the person behind the counter because of it. this location is after customs and security on the American side, and before I approached this location I had converted all of my travel money over to US funds. I picked up two drinks for my waiting time and for my flight, after dealing with 5 people in line ahead of me I went up to the cash to pay for my drinks in American money and American change. the attitude that came across from the lady behind the counter was as if it was such a grandiose problem that I paid with something other then CDN dollars, she took the money under the reasoning that I had \"exact change\" which was laughable at best.  I would steer clear of this location at any time of the day based on my experience, a vendor machine would have treated you better.  nope never again"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place for lunch uptown. I'm somewhat picky about vegetables, so I love how the menu is totally customizable...just grab a pencil and clipboard in the middle section.  I always get a custom brown rice bowl with chicken, black beans, chick peas, edamame, corn, and carrots (or beets). Everything looks, and more importantly, tastes super fresh.  The employees are really friendly and also accommodating (I always ask for extra sriracha). Don't be intimidated by a long line, as they work incredibly efficiently and fly through orders.  The prices have gone up a little since it opened, but they really stuff the bowl to the brim, so it's still a good deal. And although the proteins and many of the fruits/veggies cost extra, there remain plenty of basic ingredients to choose from. Freshii is a great option if you're looking for a healthy lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wanted a \"healthier\" and cheaper lunch option downtown, and stopped in, as I'd heard good things about this place.  The location smelled really odd, it was super hot and stuffy, almost moldy smelling.   The service was fine, but nothing fantastic.    I liked all the options they had, and all the substitutions they offered.   I wish they weren't all more money though.     I had a quinoa based chicken teriyaki bowl.  The vegetable portion was lacking, but the flavours were good.   I enjoyed the quinoa as well.    I doubt I'll go back, as it was really nothing special, and wasn't as \"healthy\" as advertised.   There was SO much sodium."}
{"text":"I'm not a Vegetarian but I certainly love Freshii.   The other day I was feeing off and they made me a custom soup. It hit the spot. I've also had burritos and salads from there. It is fast, fresh and healthy. When you don't have time for a good meal just pop in and in minutes you'll be happy.   The price is a little high but I don't mind for the quality. Again, I highly recommend the soups!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food. I always get the buddha satay bowl with steak. Great spot if you're looking for a quick and healthy lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Lots of selection but a tad overpriced. Their menu items are tasty and fresh and come in decently sized, especially for a lunch.  Service is fast and friendly. Seating, on the other hand, is extremely limited. Even as a group of 4, it was difficult for us to sit comfortably for lunch. In the winter especially, with customers coming in and out, it can get cold while you eat. It really isn't an ideal place to sit down for lunch with a group, but as a quick and healthy meal, especially those with dietary considerations such as vegetarians and paleos, Freshii is a good choice."}
{"text":"This location opened up within my work location in the North American centre right at Yonge and Finch close to the subway entrance (if you are going through the corporate building to get to the subway).  This looks like a fast food/food court type place and operates like one, but it really is fresh and healthy.  It is probably the most healthy fast food operation I have been into.  When I am feeling the need for something fast and am looking for something healthy and yummy, this has become my main go to location.  My first experience was a Ninja Wrap... I honestly don't know half of what was in this, but it was packed... I repeat packed with veggies and nuts, soft and crunchy, and yummy.  They're options are delicious and fresh... and recommended.  Again, this is fast food.... but it is healthy fast food."}
{"text":"Just had one of the weirdest, most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. In the last few months, I have heard a lot of positive buzz about this new place in the neighborhood with healthy food options. So, this evening, when I walked in the door to have dinner with my husband, I had high expectations and was looking forward to a delicious meal.   It was awkward.   When we walked in, there was only 1 other customer in the store. For some reason, there were SIX people behind the counter, mostly standing around talking to each other. I have been a manager in the restaurant business. I don't blame them - the store was very clean and there wasn't much to do. They were enormously overstuffed.   They called out our food at the counter. They couldn't even walk 10 feet to just bring out our food- we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. You had to call it out at the counter? This would be common courtesy. It didn't happen.   The food was very disappointing. I ordered the Metaboost wrap ($7.99), which was field greens and spinach, mango, kale, carrot, edamame, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette. WAY TOO MUCH balsamic vinaigrette. I added tofu for an extra $1.49, making this a $9.48 vegetable wrap. Sadly, I consumed a wrap full of wet sloppy, savagely overdressed vegetables. The flavor of the ingredients could have potentially been great. Also, they didn't toss the tofu with the other ingredients. All of the tofu was jammed into the far left side of my wrap, rather than be evenly distributed. To conclude- Overdressed greens? That sucked guys. And it was way too expensive. It's been 45 minutes, and I'm still quite hungry after eating the entire wrap.   My husband ordered the Baja Burrito ($6.99), which had quinoa, avocado, red onion, cilantro, green onions, cabbage, and pico di Gallo. He added steak for an extra $2.49. There were a few scant pieces of steak in the burrito. It was not nearly enough, probably  only 2 oz. The total cost was $9.48, and they skimped on the meat, even though they up charged for it. Worse, it was flavorless and under seasoned.   This food was not worth $20.00 for a wrap and a burrito.   It got worse.   When my husband and I were trying to eat our food, it felt like there were 6 people overhearing any conversation we wanted to have. It was very awkward. Yet, remember, one of them didn't even bring our food to us. Why are there so many people watching me eat my food? Time to cut some labor bro.   As you can already tell, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's one thing to eat something because it's good for you! But when it's good for you and you love it well that's a perfect meal! Everything was fresh, crisp and delicious! My favorited is the Mediterranean bowl, completely scrumptious.  Only complaint is that the no one seemed to care that all the tables needed cleaned. I will be back for sure however!  This is what fast food should look like!"}
{"text":"I like it Fast healthy food Tastes fresh and you have a lot to choose from Vegetarian and vegan options :) (But you can add Meat/Fish) Good prices"}
