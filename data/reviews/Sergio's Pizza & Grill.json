{"text":"I've worked in that plaza the last 4 or so years and their pizza has dropped since the new owners took over. Switched to cheaper cheese, cheaper tomato sauces and store bought salads. Their poutine is also really, really sweet which is strange. Aside from the walk in special, their menu is over priced for the quality they provide."}
{"text":"This evening we ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni on one half and green peppers, mushrooms, prosciutto, and sun-dried tomatoes on the other half. 

Yeah I know, a bit complicated but that's how we roll.

We received the glorious pepperoni on half (check); the tasty green peppers and fresh mushrooms (check), but only 2 tiny pieces of prosciutto (hmm..what gives?), and red peppers instead of the sun-dried tomatoes. Your courteous clerk even made a point of telling us sun-dried tomatoes would cost extra because they were \"gourmet toppings\".

What happened to our sun-dried tomatoes?! 

Maybe your pizza maker thought we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes."}
{"text":"Had them deliver a \"La Cipolla\" pizza to my hotel last night. Pizza arrived hot despite the outside freezing temps.  Crust looked like a par-baked crust and had poor texture with little flavor. Toppings were average at best. A completely unforgettable pizza."}
{"text":"Unimpressed ; pizza took just under an hour to deliver. We live 3kms away... No rain and no traffic, clear night after rush hour...And the pizza tasted like a frozen type pizza. Not ordering from there again..."}
{"text":"If there were pizzerias in the Soviet Union, I would imagine they were somewhat like this place. A dour, unsmiling woman at the counter took my order and did not seem to be particularly interested in dealing with customers. Fifteen minutes later I came back for my pizza. Napkins were rationed out as if they were gold and when I asked for a cup for the can of pop I had purchased, I was told it would be 25 cents. The pizza itself was not bad, pretty close to Pizza Pizza-type and was fairly cheap. The low price was the main positive attribute but I probably won't be running back here."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium cheese for $9 cad and it looked like a home-made pizza...the cheese was a little burned.

The taste?  pretty bad...It was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had...

I paid $9, but it probably was worth about $2 CAD"}
{"text":"Pros:
Sauce is almost sweet
Pepperoni is crispy
Crust is thin but not too crispy
Friendly foreign woman at the counter

Cons:
Ordered and said I was going to get a couple groceries and would be back to pick it up soon - it went into the oven when we walked back in to pick up."}
{"text":"Pretty good place...I find it better than Pizza Pizza.  The crust is nice and thin (which I like) and I find that the ingredients are pretty fresh.  One thing that I like is that it's not overly salty...

Prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly.  I do want to try their lasagne one day...it looks pretty good."}
{"text":"This is mostly adequate pizza.  Decent if not spectacular slices.  Convenient from my work.  Sergio's is a step above Pizza Pizza.  Thinner tastier crust, nice sauce and a nice cheese blend.  Not in my top 10 but still good pizza if you're in the area.  I'd put this square in the middle of the 2 or 300 pizza places I've tried of all time.  They use one of the rolling rack ovens which is a big minus but it seems most places in Ontario have gone to these for speed, simplicity and convenience...but I still say these ovens are a huge step down from wood fired ovens and make for a less than perfect crust IMHO.

Great staff, OK pizza, fair prices."}
{"text":"I have had way better but it is OK in a pinch."}
