{"text":"We've been there as company luncheon. Very nice Italian fine dining restaurant. Lunch time is quite empty. Service is very prompt. 
Before I came, I heard they have the Best calamari in town. Our calamari comes in a big starter with tiger shrimp, grilled veggie, olives, cheese. It tastes so good! Everything is amazing with garlic bread. 
Main course I ordered veal shank. It's tender and tasty. The mallow inside is the best companion with bread! Rosy sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant during Savour York Region with my friend for lunch. The food was actually good, but for overall experience I'm giving it 3 starts. The biggest turn off for me was that they trick you into buying bottled water. I really hate when restaurants do it. Like asking question: \"do you like a bottle of Perierre or tap water?\" Like I suppose to feel bad or poor drinking tap water. 
In Piacere they asked as what we want to drink, we said water and the waiter brought a bottle of water and poured it in our glasses. I didn't pay attention if he actually open it or not. I looked around at other tables and saw that everyone had same water bottles. We assumed that that's how they serve it. Well, we got charged $5 for it. The food was good, but nothing better then you can get in any other fine Italian place. I would even say that they could put more effort in food presentation. 
I don't think I will ever return there, since I've been in better places then this."}
{"text":"Honestly I have been. Goin to restaurants for years and I finally found one that I enjoy the most!! Yes it's this one from the moment we walked in it was just an experience our waiter whom I thought was the owner how he had everything under control it was a busy Sat night and Tony our waiter tool care of us like we were family he asked if it was our first time I told him Yes and from there he took over he recommend everything from the best calamari fritti in Woodbridge to the certified angus rib steak to the wine and desert restaurants should have more waiters like Tony made us feel like royalty 
I am quite the regular there now"}
{"text":"my husband and I went for dinner during the savour york region promotion and definitely wont be back
although the decor was nice, the food was OK (the majority of food on our plates for the appetizers and also the dinners were mixed greens which isn't difficult food prep or worth the regular price on the menu)
there was only one other table with patrons and thus the server was waaayyyy too attentive to us, almost to the point of hovering and asking how every bite was - which we just chose to laugh at instead of getting annoyed
and also this server was such a large person he couldn't even stand up straight when he came to our table, every time he either leaned on an empty chair or braced himself against our table which became pretty unappetizing especially since he came back so frequently, which only confirmed our agreement before leaving that we wouldn't be back"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal for a birthday party of ten. The food, wine, and service were all fantastic.  Choosing antipasti was made simple by letting them build a couple variety platters.  My steak was done to perfection.  The tiramisu was delicious, and espresso finished it all off.  
Will return."}
{"text":"Definitely not the first restaurant I would pick in Woodbridge. the Antipasto platter was terrible, almost like it was thrown together for the hell of it, the seafood on the platter was was over cooked, the tomatoes were still green and the prosciutto was cut way to thick.
The pasta (sausage and rapini)was decent, under seasoned and a little greasy but edible. Although the lamb was perfectly cooked the quality just wasn't there 
I will say the wait staff was very nice and attentive and took care of our table 
All in all its not the worst but not the best, probably a better place to host a party than just going there for dinner"}
{"text":"Very good classic Italian seafood dishes. The service is very good and the wait staff is very attentive and personable. It's a nice, quiet, cozy Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service ok, but place was half empty on Friday night.   Went for bday celebration and ordered a slice of cake with candle after dinner which they brought...nice, until we saw it on the bill!  Spent over $200 and they charge us $8 for a bday slice of cake...come on.  Owner shoulda brought out a shot on them or slice of cake on them....won't go back not fun place no atmosphere and no customer relationship...enjoy your half empty restaurant"}
{"text":"Nothing special. 
Heard good things about this place, but the food was just OK. The pasta was over cooked, and my veal was very salty. It was a quite lunch meal during a weekday, so I don't see any excuses. 
The potatoes on the side was over cooked and salty as well. 
Nothing bad to say about the NY steak, but nothing good to say about it either. 
Grilled calamari was alright. Not as good as Marchello's."}
{"text":"I decided to update my review, after all there are people just like me that care about real reviews by real people.

Since my last review (i gave them 1 star) I was sent messages telling me that I need to get out more...etc. I didn't bother writing back to that person because quite frankly if this is the best you've found- well, I rest my case there.

I not only love italian food, but I have had it quite a lot. I also cook and AM italian. I had nonnis and I speak Italian. I am in no way shape or form uneducated about Italian food. I can't speak for fellow Italians or whoever else goes to places like Piacere, but I assure you reading this that I was brought up with the notion that there ought to never be a lack of food in our fridge- that when guests come over your house you put out your best...and all you got.
I believe that if you own a restaurant you're in it because you love food and you love to feed people. (at least that's why I would have one) and in doing so I would feed them my best. treat them like family and above all show an air of excellence.

The problem I had with Piacere wasn't because there was lackluster cooking it was because there was a FAKE attitude about the place. It entices you in...and then it becomes pretentious. You are made to feel like you are doing them a grand favor by eating there. And sure the food is good, but the attitude and service could use some humility.

For starters- present the entire menu (including the PRICES for your specials) How can the daily special be so much more expensive that the similar plates on the menu? and why not disclose it?
From beginning to end they played with words and deceived our party of 10+ ppl. And to top it off...they did not LEAVE the parmesan on the table for us to enjoy on our pasta.
I am a cheese lover...let me rephrase this. My WHOLE family are cheese lovers, and we have a lot of it at home. How can a place that seems to yell \"look how prestigious we are\" be so cheap?! It boggles my mind.

The service was blah, the experience was awful. The food was good.

I have not gone back on principle. I am a woman of my word.

p.s. if you dislike my reviews- stop reading them. I won't lie just to make people happy. sorry not sorry.

p.p.s. two families with a bill over $500.00 and we gave them a good tip because we're not asses like a lot of people out there. So, trust me when I say....I have enough class to pay the hefty bill and enough common sense to NEVER RETURN! But that's just me. [insert pic of kermit drinking tea]"}
{"text":"Although the service was very bad, the food was  good. The rating reflects the overall experience As a family.

One Friday evening we decided to go out for dinner as a family. My husband, our 2 young children and myself. 
We had called ahead to reserve and as usual make sure they could accommodate my food allergies.  The person we spoke to was not polite or professional, but said yes. And since we've been planning on giving this place a chance for quite a while now we decided to go ahead Anyway.

When we arrived we found the entrance to the restaurant was extremely awkward, you walk through what seems to be a tunnel due to the /temp/portable walls they had put up on two sides and then you suddenly feel like you're in the middle of the restaurant. No one there to greet you or see you. We felt like we were standing in the way of the staff and were very i'm comfortable and uncertain if anyone will even sit us. 
Eventually my husband got the attention of one of the waiters and have mentioned that we have reservations And would like to be seated. They sat us the very back of the restaurant, it seemed semi private and quiet which we preferred due to the fact that we were there with young children. the majority of the restaurant seemed to open concept and everyone was seated very closely and seemed somewhat uncomfortable to be there. The back of the restaurant where we were seated seemed like it was a temporary location for clientele, it almost seemed borderline like a storage area and they had opened another yet temporary wall to create more seating. Our table was a very wobbly and so were the chairs. Which was not a huge deal but we would assume that they could correct that in a very simple manner. Once seated down, we had waited for our waiter for quite a while until  he finally showed up and realized we were sitting with no menus, he finally went and got us some menus and yet again left us sitting there. He later on came to take our drink order but we were there with her children who are very hungry and it was getting very late so we simply wanted to get the orders in and get the food cooking. To our surprise, He had  let us know that there are no children's menus and we would have to order from the regular menu. We had asked him if he could possibly create something simple for the children like a pasta with some cheese, to his confusion and misunderstanding we had eventually came to common ground agreement and they created a simple penne with too much butter. And sprinkled dried Parmesan, not fresh. Our other child wanted to have pizza and we asked if there was anyway to make a small pizza for a child,  and we had to order the regular size pizza which cost about 10 or $11. My husband and I we decided to start off with a drink and an appetizer each. Also we have heard their dinner specials and decided to order from there, much later after appetizers were eaten, our waiter shows up with an apology trying to explain that they have run out of the dinner specials and that we should order something else. With it getting late, and a rough start for the server, My husband and I had  exchanged looks at one another in confusion as to why it took him so long to announce that, and the fact that our children were pretty much done eating....We decided not to make a fuss and go ahead and order something else. Each time the waiter would come to clear our plates he would give me a very strange look in surprise and confusion as to how I would manage to eat all that food. (Awkward!!) He was impressed/shocked yet I don't believe it was in a positive way. Overall we were disappointed that our children are forced to order from the main menu which was quite overpriced for a $10 penne with butter which they didn't even like!  and a $10 boring cheese pizza , and neither  did  include a drink, They had given us very tiny glasses, each one had ice tea in it they had charged us $2.50 each with no refills. We thought that it was a very steep and unnecessary. At the very end of our dinner although the service was terrible the food was still good, we had mentioned that the food was good but we wish that they would accommodate a children's menu or consider half portions for young children who could not eat that much and we felt that a lot of food went to waste. We also mentioned that we eat out often and majority of family restaurants cater to families w/ children  and offer children's menus places such as Moxie's ,the waiter went ahead and compared Moxie's to McDonald's and Burger King and said that they could afford to do so, and went on a rant about how it's very expensive and not worth their while to do so and that he has been in business (serving) for a very long time to know. 
We tried to correct him by letting him know that we have family Who own restaurants and we know for a fact That a children's menu including a drink would literally not cost them very much and would bring in more clientele, and more families on weekdays!"}
{"text":"Had a very distasteful experience that made me remember why I dont go here.

Ended up here on a Sunday because Zizi closed early and boy did we regret it. 

Spaghetti was overly salty, both the filet mingon and new york steak were undercooked

By the end of the meal I told my dad 'at least your birthday wont be on a Sunday again for a while so we won't get stuck here'

I am not going back"}
{"text":"Exceptional food always fresh greats ingredients and very nice people' a real hidden gem"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh........didn't hate it......didn't love it.
Although a few minutes drive from where I live, I haven't been back since my initial visit. Food was just ok.....nothing spectacular..although way over priced for what you get.
Service was friendly, attentive, made recommendations...did all the right things.
If I'm dining out and looking for Italian...there are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I came here for lunch. We had the bruschetta to start, a delicious bottle of red wine that was recommended by the server, our mains and dessert. Excellent service and the food was very tasty! I had the pollo with red peppers, goats cheese and mushrooms. Great lunch! Will be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Piacere is quietly tucked into a corner of a shopping plaza on Weston and Rutherford. I've been to this plaza a number of times but never noticed this restaurant. We decided to give it a try for Savour York Region.

We were quickly seated. Even if we didn't have a reservation, the restaurant had plenty of seating. The waitress didn't provide the Savour York Region menus until we asked. We ordered the lobster bisque soup, the calamari fritti, the scallopini, the trout, and the capuccino truffle and the limoncello truffle. The one thing that stood out were the portion sizes. They were pretty large. I really enjoyed the calamari fritti, which I thought was a mix of grilled and fried calamari -- lightly battered. Probably the best calamari I've had. The scallopini was delicious, and the trout was well prepared, not overcooked. The desserts were really tasty. It's a ball of gelato with a caramel-like center, rolled in confection. If you're looking for a tart dessert, the limoncello is the way to go. Otherwise the capuccino truffle is the way to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Piacere this past Friday night as we were looking for a good Italian place.  Having tried several around Maple and Woodbridge, we just find they are over-rated.  Some of the other \"highly rated\" Italian places in the top ten lists you find are over priced and the quality isn't what you would expect.  They seem to be more of a popularity contest more than anything.

When we called for reservations, the gentleman who answered was extremely polite, friendly and joking on the phone.  We arrived and were greeted by the same person and he made us feel like we were a regular.  

The service was excellent and prompt, and the food was amazing.  Highly recommend the Osso Buco, which came with gnocchi served just perfectly in a great tomato sauce, while my wife had the seafood pasta, which she loved.

Definitely will be going back and seems like a new regular place for us."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Dim lit for the romantic encounter. Expect a 3 course meal for two to run up $100.

The portions are good. I wasn't able to finish my entrée. Food was okay."}
