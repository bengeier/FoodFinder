{"text":"Best dive I've found in a while! Ordered the Joe burger and it was delicious! Oh boy Sauce was smooth sauce no chunks of onions or anything. Burger was 1/4 lb so perfect for a single burger. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Our waitress even brought out my sons leftover hotdog we accidentally left inside."}
{"text":"Joe's food is great. You get an authentic atmosphere here-some bars have painted signs designed to look faded or imitation distressed wood. At Joe's you have an authentic sign where half the letters fell off probably in the 90s and the most aged shingles I have ever seen. Note this is not a complaint but a compliment to a great atmosphere. Staff are very friendly and helpful, steak burger is the best and they have a lot of drink options. Prices are reasonable."}

We chose to try Joe's Bar from a Cleveland's Best Burger Contest and a Cleveland.com burger lover's recommendation.  First, service was excellent, and all food with plated with generous portions.  Everything was great, Joe's Burger was giant, Fried Shrimp Basket tasty, Steak-Style French Fries were perfect, & the BBQ Wings were awesome too!!!!!  On a return visit, I might try the intriguing \"Real Steak\" Sub (if I read that right - that sounds appealing).

Joe's Bar sits just south of RT 10/RT 20 at the RT 301 exit heading toward LaGrange on the west side of the road, if you pass the Carlisle TWP Hall or Fire Department, then you've already passed it.  Joe's Bar is casual dining with that small diner atmosphere.  It gave me the vibe of a once thriving vibe, long past, but a legacy nonetheless still lingering.  The crowd seemed to be mostly seniors, but Joe's Bar would suit small groups, couples, or families.  The walls are covered with mostly old baseball memorabilia; I'm talking historic stuff!  It was neat to look around at the photos of Babe Ruth & Satchel Page, et al.

After dining, take a stroll in one of the beautiful Lorain County MetroParks off Nickle-Plate Diagonal Road, on the northwest (right) side of the road, if you get to Kipton Nickel-Plate Road, you've passed all the main parks & Carlisle Visitors' Center.  The MetroParks Visitors' Center is a great place to relax, learn, birdwatch, check out the raptor center's birds of prey, or just take in & enjoy nature.  A neat historical fact about all the \"Nickel-Plate\" roads is that they were short-cuts for the nickel-platers, competitive railroad employees & officials, unions, & more between at least four (4) lines of train tracks running in the area.

Overall, the price-to-value was great, because not only was the food tasty; the portions were fulfilling.  For a family of four (4), we spent less than $50 to dine with a generous gratuity.  The downsides were Joe's Bar is a cash only establishment with no credit cards accepted, no draught beer on tap, & no free refills on soda pop.  I also noticed a sign that read a 10% surcharge was applied for any requested take-home containers.  These are disappointing standards, but quite understandable from a dive small business."}
