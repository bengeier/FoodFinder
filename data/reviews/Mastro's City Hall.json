{"text":"First time to this restaurant.  I think the \"steak house\" thing was over done, but I'm happy I went here.   I actually split the 8oz petite filet (mignon), it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The sides come family style, and we shared the sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and spinach, all were very good (and I'm sure loaded with butter!).   Great place, be prepared to valet."}
{"text":"By far the best steakhouse in town. I love their chicken, it's very well seasoned. The service is amazing and attentive. All the desserts are delicious, especially the butter cake and crem brûlée. The noise level is a little loud at times but the food and the service well makes up for it."}
{"text":"Went there for our 49th anniversary dinner on 2/5/15. This is as good as it gets. We had the lobster stuffed mushrooms as a starter they were out of this world. My wife wanted to get two more orders and skip the entrees.We ordered the filet and lobster tails for our dinner, the best. As a bonus they gave us their signature desert for free. Now the service, we had the best server of any of our previous eating experiences.It's a little noisy, but with outstanding food and service you can put up with some noise"}
{"text":"Best steak in AZ! It is a bit pricey but well worth it! I had the Rib Eye and the Mac & Cheese both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Food and service was good not great but  certaintly not memorable. The noise level is horrendous with the waitress having to almost yell to describe the specials,etc. This was in the dining room too not in the bar. Also, the table are way too close together. Better places can be had nearby."}
{"text":"Boss took me out to Mastro's for a celebration dinner and we had a great time from start to finish. Great cocktails and truly delicious food. Started with a seafood tower that literally made me smile from ear to ear! We devoured the whole thing and also each had an order of scallops that were melt in your mouth tender. Feeling pretty full from the tower and scallops i decided to take it easy (yeah right!) and went for the 24 ounce bone in ribeye. AMAZING piece of meat...just way too big to enjoy completely. Took it home, but made for pretty dissappointing left-overs. I guess having it presented on a sizzling platter is far better than rewarming on a paper plate.  Mastro's is exactly what it supposed to be...an over the top Steak house with good drinks and decadent food. Boss can take me there anytime! I suggest the King Crab Gnocchi...not quite as rich as the lobster mash."}
{"text":"Went there for a business dinner during a trip to Phoenix. Was highly recommended by the local hosts. Wasn't disappointed. The place is great, nice ambience, elaborate menu and elegant service...The drinks and the desserts were great too. Ordered the pork chops for the entree...Alas, it was overdone and dry. The only disappointment in an otherwise great evening."}
{"text":"I was in town for super bowl & knew in early january to make a reservation because they were already completely booked! I lucked out! the restaurant is very dark but the usual steakhouse feel. the staff was great & very friendly & the food is amaze!"}
{"text":"The bf was craving a steak, so naturally Mastro's was at the top of our list.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to splurge on a nice night out.  As many have noted, the bread basket is pretty great.  The pretzel bread is the most unique item, although I thought the olive bread was better.  Try not to fill up on bread, however, because there's plenty of other delicious food here.  We ordered two appetizers:  Blue Point oysters and the steak sashimi.  The oysters came along with the usual accompaniments, including stronger-than-average horseradish that I really enjoyed.  The steak sashimi was unbelievably tender and flavorful.  It might seem like a bit of a meat overload if you're ordering steak as your entree, but this appetizer is definitely worth it.  I ordered the twin lobster tails.  I know, I know -- Mastro's is a steakhouse.  But these were incredibly tasty (and not drenched in butter) and I enjoyed every last bite.  The bf got the 12 oz. filet, medium, served on a 400-degree plate.  The steak was tender and delicious (although I would've ordered it medium rare, as steak should be!).  We also ordered a side of the lobster mashed potatoes.  The other reviewers aren't exaggerating when they mention how huge this side is -- it can easily feed four to five people.  Plus, they are extremely generous with the lobster.  That said, I was a bit underwhelmed by this dish:  it was good, but just not off the charts.  Dessert was the warm butter cake.  Definitely created for sharing and accompanied by a huge vat of whipped cream, which is delicious in and of itself.    Last but not least, service was fantastic -- attentive, but not overly so.  The waiter even helped me detach the lobsters from the tails when I was struggling!    Bottom line:  yes, it's expensive, but equally delicious and worthwhile."}
{"text":"We went here for our 10 year wedding anniversary dinner and it was the perfect place!  The best steak we've ever had and great service, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very nice overall experience! Nice wine choices. We started out with the crab cakes as an appetizer followed by the French onion soup.  Both were amazing!   For our meal we ordered the filet and was not impressed.  The steak was suppose to be medium however it was mostly red and cold in the center.  Not a lot of flavor. Sautéed asparagus and Gorgonzola mac and cheese as the sides... both good. Best part of the night was the butter cake for desert!  It was to die for!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place is the porterhouse and the lobster mash.....done deal....I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my porterhouse....I shall return"}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall has been a go to for myself and my merry band of golfing buddies when we visit Scottsdale. After our experience last pm it may need to be removed from the list. This review is not about the food, which as usual was excellent. The service/experience left us all with a bad taste in our mouth. Since we had all been there previously, knew the menu and what we were choosing to eat, we did not need a 15 minute dissertation on the menu items. We all felt uncomfortable that we were being victims of a heavy handed upsell. We all had cocktails, which are always great, and shared 2 bottles of wine. Luckily, one of the members of our party reviewed the bill and noticed that we were charged for a 3rd bottle of wine at $85. The waiter abruptly grabbed the check and came back with the correct check. As we we're paying with cash, we were all under the impression that the waiter was going to pocket the $85. Buyer beware. Also, they should get the message that the lighting is too low when every single table is using a flashlight to read the menu."}
{"text":"You may be surprised by my 3...and I'll tell you why... Dinner was great.  In there with a large group - and I do a lot of planning, so was impressed with the quality of food for our size. The bartenders were ok - probably very irritated with the size of our group.  Delicious Ahi app - heard the beef was fab.  Dinner was a choice of meats and one salmon dish.  All were massive in size - and the mashed potatoes?  Oh - fugget about it!  It was so YUM!!!  Then dinner...our order must have not made it in because our table is still sitting there, while the other tables are getting up to leave.  Finally had to remind them that we did not get our dessert. We all took one bite and then left - couldn't even have coffee. In the course of the rush - I left something behind.  Always double check - because the couldn't care less that you left something behind.  we were the last table...how could they not see something that is not a cup, plate or utensils?  Bummed.  I know it's in some garbage dump...and I now have a record - less than 10 days and I no longer have a BB cover...  so bummer on the service, but food is awesome.  I wouldn't take a group larger than 100."}
{"text":"Another great night at City Hall. I love this place. The atmosphere is unparalleled; the lighting, bar scene, music, and the staff all come together with the food and drink to offer a fantastic dining experience.   The Bone-In Ribeye was one of the best I've ever had. My wife's Filet was cooked perfectly and should wouldn't hesitate to tell you if it wasn't. The sides were good as always and the Butter Cake for dessert was a great ending.   Our waitress was friendly and polite but she seemed to be rushed. She still got a great tip nonetheless.   And lastly, this may be weird to mention, but I have to give a shout out to Knoxy in the men's bathroom. He's a 90 something man who's always good for a laugh.   It's certainly pricey, but the portions and quality are worth it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite place to go, for a couple of reasons.  First off, we've been for after dinner cocktails/appetizers a couple times.  Fantastic.  The drinks, for the most part - are pricy (up to $18 for a martini) but what you should be aware of, is that they pour you a full drink, and leave the shaker with you.  So for $18 you're really getting 2 very high quality drinks.  It is absolutely worth it.  I usually order 1 and call it good.  Couple times we've gotten 2 and I've definitely felt it.  I had a 3rd once and almost didn't make it home.  The alcohol is top-shelf quality and smooth as can be.  Wife loves the cantaloupe martini (sweet and smooth).  I've tried a few different.  The CEO martini is a great, fantastically smooth martini (love the blue cheese stuffed olives that come with it - i always ask for extra).  The Manhattan is strong and tasty as well.  We've also gone for dinner.  It's pricey, sure, but really worth it.  The seafood tower appetizer can really add up on your bill, but the quality is as good as it gets in Arizona.  Very cold, very fresh, just perfect.    The bone-in filet is probably my favorite...always cooked just right.  For the side dish, you CANNOT pass up the lobster mashed potatoes.  It is absolutely decadent and swimming in butter, but it is soo freaking good.  Love the pretzel bread that they put out on the table as well.    Service is always fantastic, as you should expect from a place like this.  The place is nice, and you would fit right in wearing a suit.  Although truth be told, I've gone dressed much more casually than I should have and no one has given me a hard time."}
{"text":"We live in the SF bay area and have incredible restaurants. So, we weren't expecting a WOW experience. But that is exactly what we  had. OMG!  All the hype written in reviews on Yelp  is true. You will have to dig a little deeper into your pockets to dine here but everything about the restaurant is worth the extra $$."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but as far as steakhouses go Mastro's is what I use to compare to everything else.  Great place, great service and ALWAYS great food.  Nothing I've had at Mastro's has been a disappointment.  Yes, it's expensive, but for a special occasion it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Where do I begin... 100% success rate 100% of the time. Graduation, birthdays, anniversaries, are all special when we plan to eat at Mastros City Hall. Service is excellent, great wine selection, master margaritas are fantastic and worth every penny. Steaks are \"out of bounds\" great. The staff always makes us feel special with extra touches on deserts for special occasions. They truly care about every detail. Although they serve many customers even on their busiest nights, they give you all of their attention. Did I mention the steaks are the best I've ever had?! Mashed potatoes are something you'll dream about for weeks...oh, butter cake yummm! Even if you're very full from dinner the butter cake is a \"must do\"."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday. We wanted to hang out in the bar area to have drinks, appetizers, and listen to the live music.  It seemed like no one wanted to serve us, but by the time we had a table and started to order our service got better... It just took a while.  We were there after the dinner rush so I don't know why they were being so difficult.  Our drinks and food were very good and ended up being a fun night.  I just don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"If you go here, you must try the bone-in filet!  By far one of the best steaks I have eaten.  My wife and I stopped here at the end of a trip for our anniversary dinner.  We were greeted by friendly staff and had a waiter whose professionalism and top-notch service only added to the meal.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly to order.  Medium-rare.  While the atmosphere is a little more lively than most steak houses in this price-range, the noise made for a fun and friendly feel.  The slice of chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate was a nice touch.  This was a steakhouse done right."}
{"text":"I'm not a big review writer, however, when the need arises.  Scottsdales, Arizona, no special occasion, just a husband and wife two thousand miles from home, out for dinner and willing to pay the prices at Masteos!  The service was okay, good start, sell the wine, sell the food - where is she - oh, they need the table - there she is with the check - time to go!  Food and drink review:  Martini - A+++ three martinis in one shaker - call me a cab! C+; Food - chared $65 steak - F!; sides nothing special; and,  Butter cake A+++!  Please note the portions are huge, we shared everything and still had to much food!  Reason for the review: okay service - no; marginal food - no; valet - yes valet shorted us on change for $20 and argued about it!  $5 isn't worth it, is it? Recommendation - anyplace but Masteos!"}
{"text":"Love the place, can't say enough good things.  If you really want to experience it, sit at the bar there's always something interesting happening."}
{"text":"In a pinch last Friday and planned a last minute work event the night of.   Service was on point the manager saved a cocktail table while we waited for a table.   Food was on point!   Always a great experience at any Mastro's location!"}
{"text":"Everyone kept telling me how classy this place was and I beg to differ. First of all, when you walk in, there is a line of attractive women (thanks to the inch of paint on their faces) and the tightest scantly clad outfits I've ever seen. It resembles a brothel in a facade of a restaurant. They all smiled like debutants as if they were saying Pick Me! To be fair, the food was really good but the lighting was AWFUL! It was so dark that you can't even read the menu's. They had the audacity to offer me a flashlight. Thats so classy huh? Its nothing you need to wear a dinner jacket to thats for sure. The ambience does not match the price you pay, but then again its in Scottsdale and I see class through a European lens, not a scottsdale one."}
{"text":"Perfectly aged and cooked steak! Great date night place ( hoping that my date next time will be be a gentleman. ..) but hey, at least I enjoyed my dinner! Love the lobster mashed potatoes :)"}
{"text":"Update: after writing my review about our less than satisfactory experience, I was promptly contacted by management. They gave a sincere apology and sent out a giftcard for us to come back. We came in on a random week day and enjoyed drinks, wine, salads appetizers and desert. The service was friendly and efficient and the staff at the front  of the door was welcoming and friendly. A huge improvement from our previous visit. The food was fresh, the recommendations were on point and our experience was memorable and lovely!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  The steak was cooked perfectly and I definitely recommend the mac and cheese as a side.  My only complaint for the night was that the valet gave my car to someone else! Another guest got in the car and started driving off, I had to chase him down with no help from the valet."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - its #1 for me in the steakhouse category and its my go to spot when i want to have an amazing dining experience. Everything from the atmosphere, the service, the food all the way down to the location are perfect. If you want the perfect meal follow my menu - crab cakes, build you own surf and turf with chilean sea bass and the filet, au gratin potatoes, any green, and top it off with a WARM BUTTER CAKE!!! Food coma!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal for my wife's bday.  Loved the food.  Service was great. Our waitress Jenn  was very accomodating and fun.  Great time!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, from preparation to presentation. We had the filet mignon and it was done perfectly on sizzling plates. It was by far the best I have ever had. This is now our favorite steak house and will be back whenever we are in town. While it is pricy to dine here it is well worth it."}
{"text":"great restaurant...  just ate here Sunday night...Good bar atmosphere, and great food and service. Corell was an awesome server and the food could have not been better. The pork chop was great!"}
{"text":"A fine establishment.  I think I have eaten in every Mastro's from the Ocean Club in Dana Point to the Ocean Club in Vegas to every steakhouse in between.  I can't tell you anything you don't know.  Everyone loves the bone-in filet, lobster mash, and butter cake.  Really what is better is a bone in ribeye, the truffle crab gnocchi thing...and anything chocolate.  They have a recipe on line for the butter cake it's actually pretty simple to make.  Took a date here.  Regretted it not because of the high unjustifiable prices but becaue of the people watching.  Couldn't keep my eye on my date and was checking out the crowd.  Saw an old guy (70+) white guy think a Dick Cheney look alike with a pretty attractive 20-25 year old chick who was not his daughter.  Obviously a paid situation.  I got drunk and my mouth started flapping.  I guess I yelled at the restaurant at the end of the meal \"Look at the old guy with the escort.\"  I'm a mess but it's a good spot.  Food's good, drinks are expensive, crowd watching is awesome.  I wish they sold popcorn and $2.50 Bud Lights I'd be here every night."}
{"text":"This was my first (and last) time coming here.  Very disappointed with the service and food.  When my steak finally came it was not only under cooked but my order wasn't complete.  A few minutes later, when the manager stopped by, he asked everyone at the table how everything was and if our meal was cooked the way we ordered, I said no it was not but not to worry.  The manager then proceeded to tell me he would be happy to complete my order ( which he named the missing items I didn't receive). I said \"Why would you ask me if everything was ok when you already knew the answer?\" He had no answer for me and got defensive.  Definitely not worth the $120 I spent to have dinner with 8 friends at a \"nice\" restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited City Hall Maestros last weekend and I was a little disappointed. For me, I had been there twice before and had great experiences. This was my wife's first time and she was pretty excited as she had heard me rave about this place.   We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservations and the hostess kindly took us to our table. I believe our servers name was Cassie and she was polite, knowledgeable about the menu, shared with us the specials and answered our questions. She was great.   We both ordered the fillet, sweet potato fries and brussels sprouts for sides and a nice bottle of wine. As we were waiting for our food I kept talking how great the steaks were going to be. As the food arrived shortly after, it didn't take long for me to realize my steak was overly cooked and a little rough. Almost a little rubbery, tough to choose. I had a bite of my wife's steak and it was a little better but still not spectacular which we expected for a $50 steak. I'm not one to send back food so I just toughed it out and ate more of the sides which were delicious. As mentioned We were disappointed and left wishing I had ordered something else.   Would I return to this place???  Not sure, still undecided and bummed over our experience."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance certainly deserve 5 stars and while this place is known for being spendy, I ordered a tasty bone-in filet (small one) and it was priced a little better than other steakhouses.  They also have a wine list with options at many different price points with selection in each.  I took a group of 7 and everyone was very, very satisfied with their meals.  All of the sides were good sized and disappeared quickly.  The martinis were served with the shaker so you get a little extra.  The only reason I gave 4 stars . . .our waiter.  If we had a real professional waiter, 5 stars for sure.  This punk was full of himself and still has shades of his chain      (fill in the blank with applebees, TGI Fri, Chilis or your choice) training.  As can happen with any group, after ordering we realized we ordered to many \"potato\" sides.  Within 5 minutes (may have been less) we tracked him down and asked to cancel one of them, he said it was too late (it was mashed potatoes!!!)  First, I know that they do not make separate batches of mashed potatoes to order; second, in a place like this, just cancel it as your customers requested.  Sorry Jeff, the price of the side was taken out of your tip!"}
{"text":"If you want a quality steak or food that does not make you sick go some where else. I had a reservation and still had to wait 50 minutes to be seated when i was quoted 10 minutes for the wait. When we were finally seated we ordered a medium rare rib eye and they served us a well done rib eye. We asked for the medium rare rib eye that we had ordered and they stated that they served us what we had ordered. We asked for management to address our issue and they were not only unreasonable but they were uncompromising. I did not get the name of the person that we dealt with but he was a thin man with glasses. He was condescending, rude, and uncompromising. Disappointed that we did not receive what we had ordered we decided to eat the well done rib eye & had the unfortunate experience of having food poisoning that same night. I did not eat anything that i did not usually eat other than that rib eye so it was evident to me that the cause of my food poisoning was the rib eye. Do not eat at this place if you do not want decent service, food poisoning, or edible food."}
{"text":"A perfect 5 star in my book! The best steaks you can get in az, mushrooms to die for, and butter cake for dessert that just melts in your mouth! impeccable service and stiff cocktails! Comes with a price but as it should! Great place for a special occasion or a business dinner. You can't lose!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak house chain and I have experienced them all.  As I travel around the country, I always check out the local high end steak place.  This is as good as it gets.  Hedonistic.  Tammy at the bar is a true service excellence professional.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to celebrate a special occasion!! Service is amazing as are the lobster mash potatoes and bone in filet. Always cooked to a perfect medium rare. If you haven't tried, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was perfectly prepared medium rare and split for us at no charge. We also splurged on the lobster mashed potatoes which, at $34, seemed over the top...and they were! We only wish the bread hadn't been so good so we could have eaten all of our meal and maybe shared a desert. Oh well, we will just have to go back."}
{"text":"Best food ever.  EVER!!!  We had enormous cocktails that are poured at your table and they give you the shaker too so you basically have 2 drinks in one go.  Then we ordered shrimp cocktail and these shrimp were so large I think they might have been baby lobsters, not shrimp.  They come out in a big glass dish with dry ice fog wafting out in a very dramatic fashion.  We went ahead and ordered the garlic mashed potatoes with LOBSTER mixed in.  It's ridiculous.  If you are ever on death row or given just a few days left to live, drop everything and order those lobster mashed potatoes.  I still fantasize about them when I have a hard time getting to sleep and need to go to my happy place.  We had the bone-in filet which is pretty unbeatable.  We are on a quest to find the best steak in the country, and after sampling Mastros we have a contender for the shortlist.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.   Service was outstanding. As you expect.  The NY strip for 56 bucks was about the toughest piece of meat I have ever had.  Travel the country and eat at many of the best steakhouses. This was the worst.   Ever!       Was with a client so I graciously ignored the drama and feedback.  Waitress was Tamie.  She did a great job.    Dave."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here to celebrate his birthday. We arrived and the host staff was not welcoming. In fact, they were quite rude.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it was awesome that it came out in dry ice and the shrimp were literally colossal with killer horse radish. The bread basket is good and we both loved the pretzel rolls. When the steak came out it was so hot in the pan on the plate that the grease was splattering out so much so that it got all over my husbands shirt because it was sizzling so bad. Speaking of sizzling I've had a better experience at the Sizzler restaurant. I would much rather spend my money at Don and Charlie's or BLT. We may return someday because I hope that was just an off night...best part is an employee contacted me via yelp and said they would be in contact shortly... Never even reached out to me.  Great customer service......"}
{"text":"I have business associates from Germany that visit annually.  I brought them to City Hall a few years back and now I think they make the trip just for the steak and seafood tower at City Hall.  We dined here again this past Friday and it was another spectacular meal.  The bone-in filet (Oscar style) cannot be beat.  Save a tiny bit of room for the butter cake...quite a nice way to wrap up such a great dinner.  See you again soon CH."}
{"text":"5 stars , obviously. Mastros NEVER ceases to amaze. Fantastic wine selection, love the scallops appetizer, best filets in the state, and be sure to get the butter cake for dinner. We are huge Mastros fans and my company uses this restaurant to recruit new employees... Regularly! Treat yourself and enjoy the deliciousness that is Mastros!"}
{"text":"Well worth the $ for any occasion. Great service and I recommend dining in the lounge with live music for a fun atmosphere. I recommend the tuna tostadas (amazing), lobster mashed potatoes (crazy good), and the bone in ribeye (perfect). If somehow you are able to have room for dessert, I highly recommend the warm butter cake.   If you are looking for high quality steak then you will be hard pressed to find a better spot in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Why go to another steakhouse in town? The food is standard steakhouse fare: the same delicious steaks (have the ribeye),  la carte sides, and a good wine list (albeit a bit Napa-heavy). Service is also good. Basically, the food and service are what you'd expect at Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Donovan's, etc.  But the atmosphere is much more fun. City Hall is the place to see and be seen. Beautiful people as far as the eye can see. So if you're in the mood for standard steakhouse fare, why go someplace boring?"}
{"text":"Twin lobsters were soggy and not done. Waiter was awful and took forever to get served. Hope landrys chain doesn't screw up others in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"No way is this a top restaurant unless you like crowds, noise and subpar food for an expensive price.   My wife had the peppered T-bone.  She did not like it and ended up taking half of it home but ended up throwing it out.  I had the twin lobster tails.  Nothing delicious about them at all.  Average taste at best.  Nice presentation and decent service is the best thing I can say. There are too many good restaurants to come back here."}
{"text":"By far the best place I've ever eaten in my life!!!  From the seafood tower, to the filet, and the butter cake everything was top notch.  Service was excellent as well I would recommend Mastros City Hall to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Most amazing lemon drop Martini's EVER !!! Food fabulous & over all staff are great :) ....highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse/restaurant period. The food, drinks, and service is second to none. We would like to highlight the service received from Tami (mixologist). She is an asset to the business. We look forward to our next visit.  Thank you City Hall.  R & Amy - Optima :)  It seems our review has found it's way to the \"Filtered\" section.  This is unacceptable YELP, this is a legitimate review from real customers who have no affiliation with this restaurant other then being delighted with our dining experience.  Lets try this again.  Amazing food, great from multiple servers.  The attention to detail will continue to bring us back to this restaurant.  Thank you.  \"Once again\" R & Amy - Optima"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent... I dined here with 3 friends recently and everyone was very pleased with the service and the quality and taste of the food.  This is my new favorite place to dine when in the PHX area!  Pricy but worth it!!"}
{"text":"I really do not like to write bad reviews, however, If there was a bad review I have been waiting to write it was this one...  If anyone has read any of my other reviews it is easy to see I eat at a lot of places all over the country.  I have been to some really high end/expensive establishments.  I have to say that this has to be the most unreasonably over priced steak house I have ever been to.  We walked and and were seated at our reservation time.  They were probably 75% full when we arrived.  We sat at our table 5-10 minutes before the first person came to our table.  It was another 5-10 minutes before we received water and bread that we did not even want.  As we were waiting for our water, we did open the menu and we were quite entertained with the $3200.00 bottles of wine, $300+ appetizers, $100.00 steaks.  I get it, It is a high end establishment, but if you are commanding premium prices, then you ought to be providing 100% premium services and food.  So on to that part, the food...  I ordered chicken which was so OVER salted, I only ate one piece of it...  My wife ordered Halibut which was so dry that it was almost like rubber.  Our friends ordered steaks  (Filet), of which I tried and found them to be sour in taste.  The only thing this visit had that warrants a star rating, is the crab cake appetizer, $32.00 mind you, and the sweet potato fries, $10.00...  So, if you are looking to visit an establishment where you can flaunt your disposable income, or your looking to meet someone who is flaunting, this is your spot.  If you are looking for good food, and good service I would strongly recommend you try another spot.    The manager did follow up with a call to see how our service was, and upon learning of our opinion on the visit, he offered us a bottle of wine, which we dont really drink.  When we told him we were not interested in wine, he said he would take $100.00 off of our next visit.  Given that we are out of town, that was of no value, and even if we were gong to be around longer, I would not go spend another $300.00 to get $100.00 off.  $$$$ of in Yelp talk ~$61 per person does not describe what you can expect to pay per person here.  That will be just for your main entree item (singular), no side, no drink, no appetizer, no sweets.. Oh, you will get bread... Expect to pay roughly $100 per person at least if you want 3 courses."}
{"text":"This place is great. Just like the Mastro's in OC where I am from. Service - Excellent! Food - Excellent! Prices - Expensive (but you know what to expect). Great experience. Note: Try the sushi. I would think to but did and it was EXCELLENT prior to having a steak!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between good, and overrated. Nice atmosphere , especially because we got the table next to the fire place outside. I will say the food was good, but had its flaws. While my steak was cooked perfectly, I found it to be way too salty , and the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was a huge disappointment. My friends said the fried calamari was phenomenal, but being that I don't like fish, there was not one appetizer I could eat on the menu. I just had the bread basket which had a nice variety . The wine list is phenomenal , and the dessert options were great. Overall- a safe and dependable pick but not mem"}
{"text":"Deeeelish! Great steaks, one of the best I've had. I split the 50-something oz. bone-in rib eye Australian beef special of the evening and it was just divine. It was well marbled, cooked rare-medium plus just the way I like it, and full of flavor. I obviously couldn't eat my share and I wish there was a homeless person nearby that we could've packed our leftovers for. He or she would've had a feast! Everything was great..you definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"City Hall kind of blends in with the surrounding buildings, but once you get closer you are greeted by two massive, opaque glass doors. They also have complimentary valet parking, which is a rarity in Scottsdale. The interior has a nice feel to it: classy, modern, yet understated enough so you know you're in a special restaurant.  When you walk in, the bar and lounge is to your left and is a nice size. The area above the bar is lit up with red LED inset lighting. Trust me when I say it works and I could easily see myself sitting at that bar enjoying a nice drink and some chilled oysters. Live music is a plus, too.  The main dining area is separated by several glass panels from the lounge. Our server, Alicia, was promptly at our table and when she saw we had darker pants on, she swapped out the white napkins for black ones to avoid white lint on us. I truly appreciate things like that. Noise levels in the dining area seemed pretty subdued as we could easily carry on a conversation.   We all wanted some wine to get us ready for steak. The wine list is decent size and overall quality is solid. Prices were pretty consistent at 2.0 - 2.5x retail. We started with a bottle of Robert Craig 'Affinity' Cabernet Sauvignon ($85). What a stellar wine. Robert Craig always delivers and this was just a great mix of dark fruit, cocoa, and mild tobacco all rolled into one. We enjoyed it so much that we needed more wine before our entrees arrived. We agreed on a Franciscan Cab Sav ($54) based upon a recommendation from the manager. It was a nice wine, but a little tight on its own. It needed food to really shine and shine it did when paired with red meat.  The menu has the meats front and center (nice!). Most of the serving sizes are very large and are priced from $25 - $45 (a couple are Fred Flintstone sized if you're really hungry). The seafood selection is very nice with lots of appetizer and entree choices. There are plenty of salads as well, which they'll do as half portions if you request it (nice touch). The entrees are a la carte, so you have to purchase sides separately. Here's a rundown of what was ordered at our table that I actually tried:      * Chilled Seafood Tower - Mastro's owns Ocean Club, so I knew the seafood would rock here and I was not disappointed. The Fannie Bay oysters were crazy good. Creamy, meaty, and succulent - I could have eaten 12 of them. The shrimp were huge and easily 3 bites each. We also got a few awesome snow crab claws, too.     *  Bone-in Filet Mignon -  OK, I had never seen a 'bone-in' filet, so I had to order it (12oz). It was served on a plate hot enough to melt lead that's coated with an herbed butter. I think my cholesterol count jumped 10 points just by being in proximity to it. The steak was so tender and juicy, I was loving every bite until I got full. The only negative I could find was that the steak was actually a tad bland. Not sure if it was too much butter or if the seasonings put on it just were a little dull (or both). I got Potatoes Lyonaisse on the side and they were very good.      * Rack of Lamb -This is a serious rack at 22oz and was easily shared. I counted about 8 ribs on the plate and it was presented nicely. The lamb was very tender, well seasoned overall, but a tad on the salty side for my taste. It paired very well with the Franciscan Cab. Side dish was sauteed asparagus and it was perfect crisp-tender.      * Warm Butter Cake - The dessert menu is large and has many appealing choices. The manager said that if you have one dessert, it must be the Butter Cake. All I could think of was \"great, more butter....\", but this is so not what I expected. Think of the best pound cake you've ever had crossed with a fresh shortcake, served warm, with killer good vanilla bean ice cream and fresh berries. After the first bite, I knew why it was their signature dessert. I wasn't alone in my thinking because we destroyed it. No questions when you go, just order it...  Final Take   'Wow!' to the service and attention to detail. The manager, Justin, personally checked on us twice and gave us solid ordering advice as well as chatting for a bit. Our server also was top notch and professional. I always appreciate service that is there when you need it, but not in your face. City Hall delivers very well in that regard. Add in some amazing food along with great wine and bar choices and you have the makings for a very special evening. Next time you need to celebrate, consider doing it here. Just be sure to order the Butter Cake first...  Overall Grade = A- (Excellent)  The EV Foodie"}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall was awesome!  The food was absolutely delicious and definitely worth the splurge.  (And for the reviewer who gave them 3 stars because there were no good vegetarian options, umm it's a steakhouse, what were you expecting?!?  Go to Pita Jungle if you want vegan/vegetarian/GF, etc).    Anyway, we had reservations for 6:30 pm and were seated promptly.  It was our first time there and our server was very helpful in explaining things to us and offering recommendations.  We started off with a midori sour which was great and then started in on our bread basket.  There were four different breads, a flat, crispy parmesan bread, an olive bread stick, a regular or sourdough roll and a pretzel roll.  All were great.    Then on to dinner...We did not order any appetizers or salads because we wanted to save room for the good stuff.  I ordered the bone in filet in a medium rare plus (so cool you can order between two 'doneness' levels).  It was an absolutely delicious, melt in your mouth, flavorful steak.  The best I've ever had (and I've had fillets at The Keg, Firebirds, Ruth Chris, etc).  My husband ordered the porterhouse and he said it was the best steak he's ever had as well.  We were literally eating it and with every bite talking about how good it was!  We chose three sides to accompany our dinner and honestly it was WAY too much food for us.  We said that next time we went, we'd only get one (although that would be hard to choose which one to get).  We got the asparagus, which was topped with fresh garlic and was cooked tender-crisp, which was perfect.  We also got the gorgonzola mac and cheese which was phenomenal.  We also got the sweet potato fries (I think 5 potatoes were used, there were so many!) and they were very good too.    Finally, for dessert, we ordered the cherry cobbler and the warm butter cake (both served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and homemade whipped cream).  Since we were celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary and had stated it when making reservations, they made this really pretty plate with \"Happy 13th Anniversary\" written on it in chocolate and proceeded to congratulate us when they served us dessert, which was a nice gesture.  The cherry cobbler was good (I am not a big cherry fan, that was hubby's choice) and the cobbler part on top was awesome.  Now the warm butter cake was out of this world!  My hubby ditched his cobbler and proceeded to devour my warm butter cake, stating it was the best dessert he'd ever had at a restaurant.  It was delicious, fortunately I was so full, I was happy to share (lucky for him :)).    We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and were even more surprised the next day when they called us to see how we enjoyed our visit!  Although very pricey, this place treats you right and delivers amazing food.  A wonderful place to celebrate a special event for sure!"}
{"text":"Although the husband and eat extremely well, for special occasions we tend to go out a bit further than usual. Celebrating his Bday, we opted for a lovely dining experience at Mastro's.   Atmosphere (4): Quiet for a Tuesday at 6 pm, which was fabulous. Mastro's can get really loud on most nights. We got a great table behind the bat next to the piano (they have live music starting at 6:30 pm which includes a piano player and singers). This was a great way to complete the night after an issue at the bar. Televisions over the bar offered a variety of options (its NBA playoff season so, we were able to catch the game). With almost 3 mins left in the game the bartender changed the channel per the request of the bar patrons. Livid, my husband goes to the bar and asks that the channel be changed back as we were watching the game and there were only 3 mins left. The bar patrons who asked that the channel be changed had the nerve to mention that they wanted to want hockey (btw there was another television in their view). After  Service (3): Though not horribly bad, I'm rating a three based on an issue with my husbands dinner. He ordered a certain steak and the server got the order wrong. When the order came out he made mention that he ordered a different cut. He had already had sides on his plate and midway through bringing a bite to his mouth she reached over with a fork, stuck it in his plate and said, \"I'll take that!\", and ran off with his steak. Gasp! Are you kidding?! No excuse me, no pardon me, nothing. We both just looked at one another and laughed. What can you do? After bringing the meat back three times, we settled because the sides were cold at this point.  Food (4): Outside of the husband having to chow down on sides due to an incorrect main dish order, the food was great. I'm still laying here mad because I'm so full. My pan seared Chilean Sea Bass was excellent. The losbter mac-n-cheese along with the brussel sprouts were great. They brought out a free warm butter cake (you can NEVER go wrong with the butter cake). And the whipped cream, WOW! It's the BEST I've ever had.  Price (4): The price was to be expected here. Mastro's is a very high-end restaurant so, with drinks, dinner and sides, you have to know that your tab will sneak up on you quick. Our bill was a whopping $288 for the two of us.  Overall, I was happy that my husband enjoyed himself on his special day. That's really all that matters. My only issue was that steak. For that kind of money, it'd better be damn perfect (tender, hot, and cooked the way you request)."}
{"text":"To celebrate our anniversary, the boyfriend and I ventured out to Mastro's City Hall for dinner.  Do not let the businesslike exterior fool you...this is a beautiful, fine dining restaurant.    Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and escorted to our table.  Didn't have a chance to check out the patio or bar, but I will say the dining room is gorgeous.  Low, but not dark, lighting.  Music piped in from the piano in the lounge, I believe??  Tables that seem packed in the room but have plenty of room between to allow you to move around.  We were seated at a two top, which I usually do not like, especially when there are fours available.  I understand why restaurants do this, but the tables are usually so small that we run out of room quickly.  This table, however, had more than enough space.  As the hostess seated us, she asked us what color napkin we'd prefer, black or white.  Never experienced that before.  I'm sure there is some sort of fancy-schmancy etiquette rule about which napkin is better, but we aren't really fancy-schmancy people.  We stuck with the white napkins that were already on the table.    Next we were given menus and greeted by the server who asked about a drink order.  I asked for water while I perused the wine list and the bf had a jack and coke.  What the waiter returned with was a water and a glass of jack (nearly full) and a bottle of coke.  A jack with a splash of coke just like he likes them.  The bf was happy.    Let me cover the service aspect of our evening.  Our server was awesome.  Very professional, educated and willing to educate us first timers on the menu and specials.  He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower.  Additionally, it was also election night and we debated even going out as opposed to staying in and watching the returns.  But, the server kept us updated with results on a regular basis from the bar tv.  Yay!  Back up staff was generally good about filling water, clearing tables, etc.  But sometimes it felt like we were being rushed.  Staff approached the table to see if we were finished when we were obviously still eating.  Like actually chewing with food still on the plate.  Nothing too major, but I would expect better here.  Ok, food...We had the seafood tower (shrimp, oysters, lobster), filets, asparagus and....wait for it, wait for it....the lobster mashed potatoes!  The seafood tower made a dramatic entrance complete with dry ice.  Again the server was very accommodating and helpful.  He made great recommendations and basically was able to create this dish as we wanted it.  Everything was delicious and the creamy mustard sauce was phenomenal.  I would choose that over cocktail sauce anytime.  I had the petite filet and the bf had the regular.  Both were cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths.  Also, the bf's steak seemed much larger than 12 oz.  Asparagus was bright green, firm but tender.  If you read the reviews here, people are raving about the potatoes.  With good reason...they are delectable.  Ridiculously good.  Seriously, my mouth is watering right now.  Do not fret if you don't see them on the menu.  They are a special item that they almost always have.  We paired a bottle of Cab with our entree which was very nice as well.  After dinner was cleared, we gladly boxed up our leftover mashers (seriously it could serve 4 easily).  I thought we were ready to go, but out came a slice of delicious chocolate cake as a treat for our anniversary.  We didn't order this, they just brought it out.  Regardless of what kind of restaurant you are at, this is always a nice touch.  Even with our best efforts there was no way we were going to finish the cake so after a few bites that went in a box as well.    In spite of the earlier rushed feeling, once we finished our meal we were left alone to finish our drinks.  This was easily one of the best meals I've ever had.  It is spendy, so we won't be back often.  But we will be back again and be recommending it to all our friends.    ps...the bf paid so I can't really complain, but those take home boxes??  They made it home, but I've never seen them again. :)"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the service but the food was great.  I went there with my boyfriend expecting one of the best meals of our life.  Our reservation was later, we were sat at a bad table and before we could tell the waitress we weren't satisfied she was gone.  The food was exceptional!  Tuna tar tar was great, not that much tuna a lot of avo and crunchy things.  Beefsteak tomato, fab as always.  The fillet was amazing...BUT it comes with melted butter on it (Ruth's Chris like) and doesn't say that on the menu and the plates are at 400 degrees, I was almost sweating.  The baked potato was okay...we were treated different because we weren't 40, the waiter screwed up our drinks and rushed us.  Like I said the food was good a couple of surprises we would have liked to know about but the service and experience was marginal.  Don't get yourself to psyched up about it."}
{"text":"My fourth and last trip to City Hall was dissappointing.  My 3 previous trips were incredible, but this experience was so bad that I don't think I'll give them another chance.  The restaurant was packed on a Thursday night and the waitstaff quickly brought us water, but our waitress took quite a while to get to our table and greet us.  Within 10 minutes we received our basket of delicious handmade breads, and that was by far the best part of the meal.  We split an appetizer of Caprese Salad.  It is not a traditional caprese, as they drizzle both, a pesto dressing in one direction and a balsamic reduction in a mirror image.  The salad was tasty but at $12 it could have had a little more tomato and cheese.   Now for the bad part...I've had 2 of the 10 best steaks in my life at this restaurant.  The other restaurants include Sparks Steakhouse in NYC, Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa, Peter Lugers in NY, and Charlie's Steakhouse in Orlando.  However, this steak wouldn't have passed for an Outback Special for $14.95.  I ordered the 16oz NY Strip (no bone) medium at $41.95.  The waitress explained slightly red center, mostly surrounded by pink and then a nice char on the outside.  That sounded good but that wasn't how it was served.  It was placed on the table and I looked at the steak jiggle as she moved her hand away.  I knew it was going to be too rare at that point, so I told her to stay until I cut into it. Sure enough it was about 2 minutes shy of medium.  I asked her kindly to put it back for just a minute or so and NOT TO OVERCOOK IT.   guess what.  It came back brown almost to the center.  I was livid but kept quiet because I was there to celebrate my girl's birthday and didn't want to make the evening about me.  She ordered the petite filet (8oz for $35.95).  Although it was tasty, her comment was, \"it's nice but you make a better filet at home.\"  I was both delighted and pissed off to hear those words.  Now the worst part, the side dish.  We ordered potatoes au gratin much to my chagrin.  I was leaning toward the sauteed mushrooms as I enjoyed them immensely in the past, but she wanted the potatoes.  They were disgusting.  A pan full of thick sliced potatoes was heavily coated with a 1/2 \" thick layer of cheese.  Above the cheese was a 1/8\" to 1/4\" layer of oil that had seperated from the cheese.  I ate two bites of the $11 side and vowed not to take another bite. The potatoes were mushy and I realized it was not worth the caloric intake.  The best part of the evening was the slice of chocolate cake that was decorated beautifully with Marney's name on it for a nice personal touch.  With tax and tip our dinner was $165.  I don't mind spending that kind of money on a delicious meal, but I feel like it should have been $50.  I received a call from a hostess the following morning to ask how \"my experience was.\"  I told her that it was going to be my last.  I explained my previous dining experiences and that this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  She said that she had heard similar comments from diners that evening and that she would like to \"earn our business again,\" but didn't expand on that.  I believe she had an opportunity to win me back at that point, but the phone line got quiet and then she thanked me for coming in.  Sorry City Hall, looks like Donovan's will move back to the top of the list."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent dinner last night! Steaks perfectly cooked, fabulous lobster mashed potatoes and a wonderful bottle of wine. The staff was also outstanding. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was a great steak.  I got their signature bone-in filet and it was fabulous.  Cooked perfectly, monstrously thick cut.  Excellent.  We had a nice bottle of wine and split salads and sides between the group.  It was pricey, about $100 per person, I think.  We also had several beers, as this was a bachelor party dinner, just to give you an idea of what we got for the money.  We were all full and satisfied at the end.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a top end steakhouse.    They have a nice bar area too with tons of beautiful women.  Not a bad place to hang out while you're waiting for your table."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure you could order ANYTHING on the menu here and love it.  We started off the meal with some bottles of wine and Seared Ahi Tuna, which was phenomenal.  Our waiter was wonderful and offered suggestions for our meals. I picked out the 12oz filet. The side dishes are big enough to share and we opted for garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn and sautéed spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious.  For dessert we shared Mastro's Signature warm butter cake (everyone raves about it), the creme brûlée and the fresh seasonal berries. Overall beyond exceptional food, great wait staff and beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"A group of four came here for dessert and drinks on a Saturday night after dinner elsewhere. This bar is one of the best place for people watching. The butter cake is the most amazing dessert ever. Our tab for 4 cocktails and 4 desserts was about $120, not including tip.  Little pricy, but worth doing once a quarter.  On a side note, I have been to this location multiple times.  The food and service have never disappointed.  The filet and lobster mash are my favorite.  They do a nice presentation if you tell them it is your birthday."}
{"text":"We chose Mastro's on a whim last year when we were AZ for Spring Training. We had such a great experience, we decided to go back. My husband and I shared a delicious shrimp cocktail and ordered the petite filet which was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Brussels Sprouts were excellent. But then, I nearly passed out--through NO FAULT of the restaurant. When I became dizzy, the staff stepped up to calm and care for me. Paramedics were called, and I was taken to the ER. If I was going to have an emergency, this was the place to do it. Everyone was so concerned and caring. The manager called the next day to see how I was doing. That being said, I'm disappointed we didn't get to stay to for dinner as the food at Mastro's is superb."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. Ordered the pork....way over cooked and very dry. Mac and cheese had NO flavor, the onion rings were foul. The only good thing was the sweet potato mash, mushrooms and Brussel sprouts. Won't ever eat there again. Over rated and ridiculously expensive for the terrible food. Our waitress was very nice and attentive though and the pretentious people watching was amusing or/and annoying. Better buck up because right now your the worse steakhouse I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"If you have money to spend and want the best steak dinner ever, come to Mastro's. It's the perfect place for a special dinner out or a great place to enjoy a drink and fresh shellfish in the bar/ lounge area. Other yelpers have done a great job describing the restaurant so I'll skip that and make some food recommendations.   The shrimp cocktail has 3 of the biggest, most delicious shrimp you could ever find and go great with any of their signature martinis. I love the margarita martini which is strong, perfectly chilled, and is worth the $18 because there are 2 servings in the shaker. The wine list is very impressive as well. They have so many amazing bone in steaks that it is hard to choose but my favorite steak is the bone in KC strip . Perfect combination of tenderness and flavor . It can easily serve 2 especially if you enjoy some of the amazing side dishes like potatoes au gratin, grilled asparagus, and the most amazing, legendary Alaskan king crab gnocchi. You will die! Try to save room for any of their desserts, especially the butter cake or chocolate dipped strawberries. The service is supreme and the food even better. Mastro's is the perfect place to indulge and is a true destination for steak lovers."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how this place has a 4.5 star rating... We went for dinner and my boyfriend dropped me off so that I could get a table in the bar area. We arrived at 5:25 p.m., not busy at all. Nobody came to our table for at least 20-25 minutes, especially since I waited on him to park the car (about 15 min). At that point we should have ran out. Waiters were just standing around and talking about women (making crude remarks) instead of doing their job. 10 waiters and not one of them would help me...Finally Iris, the cocktail waitress came over and brought us our menus. I was still unsure who was taking care of us. So we ordered 2 Cesar Salads. Those were OK, BUT CHEESE WAS SOUR..Then we ordered the Rack of Lamb. We ate a few bites and it was totally bland...The Manager Kyre came over to try and make it right. She was very nice, but then the Bald headed GM came over (didn't introduce himself just said, Yes) and he was a complete joke. I can't even believe he's the GM. He has 0 personality. He knows nothing about Customer service. He said, \"The Lamb is his favorite and he's NEVER had a complaint from anyone\", well he should've been at my house afterwards, because WE had the worst food poisoning ever... Oh yes and let me back up. After the lamb, he offered to get me a steak (that they specialize in), first it came out under cooked and then over cooked and once again bland. I sent that back as well. Then the manager offers us dessert. We had the Creme Brulle which should not be hard to SCREW UP, guess again... As for a quiet evening, don't sit in the bar, live entertainment to loud and horrible. Thank you Mastro's for both of our stomachs being upset and not being able to sleep most of the night. We will never come back... Thank you for the food poisoning...had to give 1 star, because I couldn't give less. I was given a gift card a few years back, but I don't dare give it to anyone, because I wouldn't want them to get food poisoning like we did... I'M WILLING TO TRADE FOR $50 STARBUCK'S GIFT CARD.. This is a great place to take someone if you want to DESTROY their night and get them as sick as can be."}
{"text":"The service and food are solid.  It's a bit pricey but definitely worth visiting if you're from out of town.  Good scene."}
{"text":"The bone in fillet per my husband was awesome. We had it Oscar style with king crab. The crab was good, but small portion. The shrimp cocktail was really good with the best horse radish and cocktail sauce. The sides were twice baked potato / good, asparagus / okay and creamed corn / good. Dessert was the signature warm butter cake / awesome. The best part however was the server Troy who was knowledgeable, gracious and appropriately attentive. No Scottsdale snobbery and absolutely first class."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go to in Scottsdale. Mastro's never seems to let me down. I am also a big fan of Oceans Club but City Hall is closer to my house. The atmosphere is fun and inviting. But be sure to dress up. Now to the food. Everything was prepared flawlessly. I had the Tuna which was delicious and my man had the bone in filet. If you had to choose just one side to order hands down it would have to be the lobster mashed potatoes! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The butter cake was the best part. Food was good but not great... Its expensive so be  prepared to drop a hundred bucks per person."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday because we were told nothing but good things, and I would give one star to mastros but because our waiter was really good I'll give 3. First off our food lacked flavor and the Brussels sprouts were so burned that they were inedible. The only thing I ended up eating was the cake which was really good. Then to top it off when I got in my car after valet brought it to me my key fob was sitting in a cup full of water now it no longer works, luckily I have a spare. Thanks mastros definitely not worth the $700 dollar bill."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Food is great, as well as the service. Go early and have a drink and peoplewatch at the bar"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Tuesday night. Granted it was during Spring Training, but I don't think they have a problem filling the joint. It's got a great atmosphere. The bar seemed fun with live music playing and lots of people enjoying themselves.   The food... If you love enormous portion sizes, then this is your place. I had the petite fillet and couldn't finish it, which I was very sad about because it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. My husband had the bone in fillet, which was terrific as well. For sides we just ordered one because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish more than that. We had the crab gnocchi, which was great, but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part. We didn't have room for dessert. Oh, one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you. Pretzel bread, olive bread, amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying.  The service was OK. Definitely some room for improvement. Overall though, the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines.  This place would be great on an expense account."}
{"text":"After much discussion, and taking into account the recommendation of a valued friend, we deviated from our tradition of going to Ruth's Chris when visiting Scottsdale.  The good:  Bar - Great way to start. Our cocktails were excellent as was our service. Dinner - We found a great new wine (new to us) called John Anthony at a reasonable price - score! Desert  - Free butter cake as we were first timers.  I don't eat desert.  It holds no appeal  whatsoever.  This cake was made with the devils hands as it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The whipped cream was also five stars.  The Not-So-Good  Dinner - We had the bone in filet and strip.  Both very average.  Prepared properly but simply not as tender or tasteful as expected. Creamed Spinach - Good  Service - OK.  A full house on a Tuesday but there were mix-ups with our orders.  They were eventually sorted out.  In general, the service was slow but adequate.  Not what's expected at this price point.  Overall  - The wine and the dessert were the high points.  Not a ringing endorsement of the signature dish at a high end steakhouse.  One and done - Back to Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Just visited this location for the first time and was very impressed throughout the dinner.  As stated by other reviewers our server was fine but seemed to disappear for longer periods of time as our meal progressed.  That wasn't a big deal as there were plenty of other staffers that were very attentive.    The entire meal was outstanding!  And of course we had to try the butter cake since this had been recommended to us by a friend.  I'm so glad we did.  Wonderful!  The only thing that I find a bit irritating is the long row of tables along the wall that seems to be your fate if you're a party of 2.    All in all, a great restaurant for a special night out."}
{"text":"Before a NYE vacation in Scottsdale, I was told that Mastros was a MUST TRY-- and I am SO delighted that we did!  I was in with a group of 12, and the food and service were both EXCELLENT!  Fortunately, being in a large group allowed us to try a lot of different things. I would recommend the following: Shrimp cocktail-- VERY large shrimp and REAL horseradish-- fabulous!  Any of the sushi - fresh and great!  Bone in filet- many in our group had filets and they were incredible.  Lobster tails-- this was my entree and I loved it!  Sweet potato mash-- like a dessert! Garlic mash- fabulous!  Steamed broccoli and spinach were great sides.  To finish your meal, the Butter Cake is an ABSOLUTE MUST-- it melts in your mouth and is definitely big enough to share!"}
{"text":"I selected Mastros as the place to celebrate my 50 year bday with family. I read a lot of reviews which I was hoping the experience on this special day was as satisfying as everyone has written.   Mastros was \"awesome\". Bobby was our server and he is fantastic. He explained everything in detail on how the menu works to all the preparations of their very delicious food. Our table started with some Blue Points and Oysters Rockefeller,outstanding. Next, the bone-in filet, rack of lamb and the Prime Rib was our main course along with some garlic mash, asparagus, twice baked and sauté mushrooms. Everyones meal was prepared to perfection and the flavor of everything was delicious. The steak, rack of lamb and prime rib melt in your mouth.  The music put a nice touch on the evening. Book your reservation now and ask for Bobby  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just because of the initial greeting - the young girl greeting the customers was so rude to my daughter who checked in first.  She left the impression that it was an imposition to even talk to her .  There were 6 of us and This was a real let down.  She wouldn't even seat us as we were 5 minutes early.  The food and wine were great , but I really don 't know if I would go back because of this initial \"greeting.\"  What a turn off .  We had reservations for 5:30 on Saturday 01/09/16 .  I hope management checks this out, as my daughter complained of this treatment to the manager."}
{"text":"We splurged and followed the recommendations for Maestro's. We had reservations but it was crazy busy and out table was not ready. We did get seated outside which was lovely ambiance with bistro lights and a fireplace BUT you were also privy to the secondhand smoke from everyone above you smoking outside which was less than enjoyable.   The steak and sides I chose (served family style) were pricey but my steak was tasty and served to order.   The drinks were expensive.   The service was OK.   The bill was not representative of the overall \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"Incredible dinner and experience.  I organized a buddy's bachelor party dinner here for 10 guys.  We pre-arranged to have 6 bottles of Duckhorn Decoy set aside with their events staff, they were very helpful.  We started out with the seafood tower, it was an awesomely big tower of lobster, crab, shrimp, and oysters -- all were outstanding.  To start, I had the warm spinach salad.  For main course, I had the bone-in filet cooked medium rare, it was one of the top 5 steaks i've ever had.  We got the mac & cheese and garlic mashed patatoes, both were good but second to the steak.  It was Friday night and very busy, cool atmosphere.  Would go back for sure if in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I ordered the excellent and monstrous bone in filet. Rare. And they cooked it perfectly. The sides are served in what looks like a vat. Seriously, we ordered three sides for six people and barely finished half of each. Service is excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here tonight because we had heard such great things about the food and environment, and based on our experience we were able to see why. Immediately upon sitting at the bar our bartender served us, which was nice.  Having just had dinner, we weren't too hungry but decided to try the Creamed Corn followed by the  Warm Butter Cake. A very polite server brought us our corn in minutes. The corn was excellent! It was sweet, but not too sweet.  Finally it came time for dessert. The famous Warm Butter Cake! The cake was topped with ice cream, strawberries and oranges paired with the biggest bowl of whipped cream I've ever seen. This dessert is to die for! It was warm, moist, cold and so good that we honestly felt like we were in heaven. It was definitely worth making the trip for.  A glass of champagne, a side, and dessert came out to about ~$30. Service was  excellent! I'll definitely have to come back here on an empty stomach one day to try their full menu because the food that kept passing under our noses looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Ladies if you're looking for a sugar daddy, you're bound to find him at this Scottsdale steakhouse. While there's no denying that the steaks are tops. I'm more of a fan of the bar atmosphere.   My friend and I cruised into the see-and-be-seen restaurant for a drink recently and within in a matter of minutes, we were approached by a group of  sharply-dressed guys in their late 40s. We politely declined their invitation for dinner and drinks, but their next target group -- three buxom blondes who appeared to be in their early 20s -- took them up on the offer.   If you're planning to come for simply cocktails, be sure to bring some extra cash because drinks are pricey. And if you order a martini, try the fruity flirtini, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"City Hall does it right....fantastic steaks....fantastic service. A bit pricey...but worth it."}
{"text":"A solid 3.75 stars (rounded to 4?) for my first visit of Mastro's.  The Good: -Oyster on half shell--- OMG, they were so fresh! I definitely was not expecting this fresh even I was told they have seafood fly-in everyday. I'd give a five-star just for this. So fresh and so delish!! Reminds me of the blue shells in Boston every time I go. -Bone-in Filet--- first time to have bones in my filet, very juicy and tender, the meat were seriously melted in my mouth. -Great service -A big bread bowl with a few good selections -Complimentary valet parking  The Not So Good: -Lobster Mashed Potato--- regular garlic mashed potato added chunks of lobster (6 or 7 bites?), not only tripled the price, but tripled the salt. I do not like salty food, the extra salt they added to the lobster totally killed the flavor, and the plate was oily, don't ask me why.  -Ambience--- kinda odd to me. The bar, the open floor dinning tables, then private rooms. With everybody squeezed in the edges and booths, I don't know how they managed to do that. -the Live music--- meh...a-okay...  ***All plates are A La Carte, meaning big portions to share!**"}
{"text":"You really can't beat their steaks.  I got the petite filet, hubby got some kind of ribeye.  5 star meal either way.  You have to try the butter cake"}
{"text":"My dad's (the \"Mayor of Scottsdale\") favorite place! haha We always have celebrations here so I think it's good for groups. The service is top notch and the food is even better. I always made fun of my dad that this is the only place he'll go for a steak, but I've come to believe that City Hall does indeed have the best steaks in town."}
{"text":"Been to this place once! We were a big group, so we kinda tried a lot of their food. I had the steak which was ok! IChili's steak was better :(  If you are looking to get some awsome steak, stop by Ruth's Chris Steak House."}
{"text":"Always a favorite!  The butter cake at the end is always worth saving a little room."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years. It was reliably excellent until this week. The king crab legs tasted old. The scalloped potatoes were separated, curdled and had a sour taste. The hostesses were beyond rude. We were never questioned why we didn't eat any more than a bit of our sides and we were not offered desert, when the warm butter cake is a must.  The only plus was the filet. I really hesitate to come back when $400 was spent on 2 people for an awful experience."}
{"text":"Just stepping inside, you get an immediate feeling that this is going to be really REALLY good. I clutched my wallet several times to make sure I had not forgotten it. It would take a hell of a lot of dish washing to pay this bill! I had not even sat down yet!   On this visit I was with out my niece, my brother and his friend. We sat in the lounge where live music provided jazzy energy to the room. It seemed like the ceilings were low and the glass partitions between the dining room and lounge were just illusions. There was a flurry of activity from the various servers and other guests. The place was jumping!   one by one, our white napkins were immediately replaced with black ones as if to signify we were an active table. We selected sparkling and still water for the table although all of us ended up drinking the sparkling. It seemed to be the perfect rinse for our palettes.  Our Martini's, however, were the best rinse of all our woes.   a bread basket that featured a variety of crusty temptations arrived next.   We ordered the standard steamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes as our sides. Just because, we added snap peas and sweet potato fries too!   My niece had just the Cesar salad which she said was amazing. That did not stop the rest of us from ordering the fillet.  Once everything began arriving, it was very difficult to keep up. there seemed to be a dozen hands replacing silverware, collecting old plates moving and refilling glasses and shaking the last drops of poison from the martini carafes.  Finally the meal was perfectly in place.  It was a sight to behold- everything was steaming hot and vibrant with color.  I don't have to tell you that it all tasted even better than it looked. Our server check in frequently.  the music continued to thrill and the meal settled in our bellies with satisfaction.  Even though we were completely filled, it did not stop us from diving in to the drmy Butter cake with freshly whipped cream on the side."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have been to City Hall and it blows my mind every time how great the service, atmosphere and food is! I have never had a bad experience, and will be going back whenever I need a great meal and a strong drink. We were celebrating my younger brothers birthday this time around. On my reservation made online I said that it was his birthday and it was his favorite restaurant to eat at. Upon sitting down after getting a drink from the lounge area, our waitress wished him happy birthday. We got quick and efficient service and could not have asked for a better meal. I got the Mastro's Cosmo and boy was it good! For the price of the drink, my martini glass was refilled 4 times (it seemed never ending!) We stuck to the bread and salad as starters. My mom and I split a large house salad which has shrimp and blue cheese... So yummy! They brought it out to us already divided in half which was a great touch and attentive to what we stated. For the main meal, my mom and I both got the petite filet, my brother got the New York strip, and my dad opted for the roasted chicken. The steaks are always prepared beautifully and you honestly could cut them with a butter knife. My dad said his chicken was the bat he's ever had, and the portion was basically half a chicken cut up and divided by section. For sides we got the Mac and cheese, steamed asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. All of which are impressive! If you don't like the lobster Mac, just get the plain and it won't disappoint. The garlic mash was smooth and creamy and not overpowered by garlic.   After they cleared our plates and crumbs, they brought out a slice of their delicious chocolate cake for my brother with a candle and again said happy birthday. Since I still hadnt used my check in special yet, I got the warm butter cake which comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, fresh berries and a huge side of fresh whipped cream. It's heavenly! If you go you absolutely have to get the butter cake even if you don't have room! :)  Overall, Mastro's is always a great venue to eat at and I will always enjoy the service and food even if it does come with a hefty pice tag at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Great service, but the food does not deserve such a high price. Same quality food, ambience and service in another restaurant would be much cheaper."}
{"text":"Mastros = look no further for the absolute best steaks in town! We had a family holiday dinner and everything was just perfect!  From the fabulous food & wine to the attentive service staff - they know how to take care of you!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect including the band and service was impeccable.   Lobster mashed potatoes were orgasmic.   I had a double cut pork chop w warm spinach salad....."}
{"text":"A disappointing dining experience, especially when compared to how fantastic it once was. Not nearly the culinary delight that made it my favorite high-end steakhouse in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The service is still excellent but the food is definately mediocre. At these premium prices, appetizers, salads and main courses should be nearly flawless and that's not the case. I'm going to give it a year and then try them again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Mastro's for a celebratory dinner and left with an incredible experience and memory. I have been to many top name steakhouses, including the Mastro's in Las Vegas, but this particular location left me smiling and raving into the next day. Our waiter's name was Corel and not only did he provide great insight to the menu, he was very personable and kind. We were never left asking for anything or waiting for him to come around. He engaged in such fluid conversation with my husband and I and found that we are military. When our bill came he had provided us with a military discount that we were unaware of and topped of our meal with a complimentary cake, to our surprise, for the occasion. The food was incredible and I are until my stomach literally hurt. I found myself making \"mmm\" noises every time I bit into an item on my plate, my husband and I could not decide who had the better order. I highly recommend Mastro's in Scottsdale for anyone looking for a nice meal and incredible dining experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I have always had a great experience there. The staff is wonderful and the food is great. The drinks are great as well. My must have is the sautéed shrimp and of course the butter cake. Another favorite is the mac n cheese. I'm not a big fan of red meat but I have had the steak and it was great. I'm more of a seafood person. I've had almost all of their appetizers and they are all great. This place is nice for a date, group dining or just dinner with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"Customer service at its best.  Christmas Eve and the restaurant we had ressies at 'lost' them and we were basically told we were SOL.  After frantically calling around only to be told time and again, we're booked, spoke to Donna at Drinkwaters and she told us they'd find room for us, come on down.  Showing up, though terribly busy, we were seated in one of the dining rooms that was out of the busy, noisy dining areas.   The food, as usual, was outstanding and the butter cake stood up to its reputation , the wait staff impeccable .    Expensive, yes, but worth it.    When folks ask for places to eat in Scottsdale, we'll be sure and tell our story of the fantastic customer service demonstrated on Christmas Eve at Drinkwaters."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very pricey but the quality and service is there.  I had the bone in 12oz filet and it was outstanding. Cooked just right and tender and flavorful.  Very active place so do not go there expecting a quiet dinner.  But we like a good atmosphere.  One app, bottle of wine, one side, and 2 filets cost $268 with tip.  Yikes!  But we splurged and couldn't stop commenting on how good every taste was."}
{"text":"This is the BEST restaurant  I've had the pleasure of experiencing in Arizona, hands down. This is always my choice for my Birthday dinner. Outstanding service, steaks, and dirty martini's! Pricy , but worth every penny. The only reason Maestro's gets only 5 stars from me, is because I don't have the option to give a perfect 10. Thank you for reading :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time!  The service is always excellent and the food is out of this world.  If I am in the mood for a five star dining experience, Mastro's is always a consideration."}
{"text":"BEST steak in town hands down!  Great crowd, live music, professional servers, wonderful menu.  The LOBSTER mashed potatoes are a MUST TRY on the menu!! I had one martini and couldn't finish the second because the first one did enough damage :)  housemade whipped cream with dessert literally made me dance in my chair.  Fantastic, fun place to go on a date~!!"}
{"text":"We have been to most of the great steakhouses in the Valley and after were done we always think we should just have gone to our standby of Mastros!  We love City Hall and visit the Ocean Club frequently as well. Their seafood towers are fabulous and a great way to impress clients since they come out smoking!  As does my fave martini, the lemon drop that also has dry ice!  We have had fabulous service nearly overtime we've been there.  I almost always get the Big Eye Tuna which is the best tuna in the valley!  My husband gets a filet so it is the best of both worlds.  The sides are also amazing, we always get the brussel sprouts, broccoli and some kind of sinfully good side like mac and cheese or potatoes!    But my fave part of every meal is dessert and they don't disappoint on that either.  I am a sucker for chocolate so for a hot dessert you can go wrong with the chocolate pudding (hot must cake with ice cream-fabulous) but the sin cake and chocolate layer cake are also amazing. If your not a chocolate fanatic the pecan pie and key lime are also great!  We love Mastros and wouldn't recommend anything else as of yet!"}
{"text":"Good steak place. Nothing special. A bit pricey. Hard to find parking. Good wine selection tho."}
{"text":"One word for this place...baller...food is a bit pricey but u get what ya pay for! The filet mignon bone in steak is to die for as well as the delicious sides (esp. the lobster mashed potatoes!)! We went as a group of 6 and the bill was off the roof! BALLER!"}
{"text":"I hate to preface this with \"I'm not a steak guy\" but the statement couldn't be anymore accurate. I'm really not. However, the 8oz filet I vacuumed down the night we spent at Mastros was by far the best I've ever had. Tender, perfectly seasoned and prepared, etc... It actually made me smile as I was chewing.  Prior to this specimen meat chunk, I'd ordered the sautéed shrimp. I don't know where they catch these things, if they raise them in tanks and feed them nothing but hormones and steroids, or even if they're manufactured,  but these too were the best I've ever tasted.  Being \"a seafood guy\" I've eaten a lot of shrimp over the years but these were unfair to all others tasted up until this moment. They were massive. The seasoning was like old bay meets crack- you didn't know exactly what it was but you needed to keep ingesting, rapidly, because it was so good. I'm not ashamed to admit I actually dumped the remaining sauce onto the steak. Yea, that's right. And I'd have drank the rest if I wasn't in a swanky public hot spot-that's how good it was. Aside from the ridiculous food, the decor/ ambiance was dialed in to the clientele (very cool/ bourgeois). Service was also impeccable. I'd give it a sixth star if I could."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my dining experience here. Valet parking and friendly staff. I'm not sure what one of the other reviewer's experience was at this place in regards to racism and sexism. I am Hispanic (obviously so) and was not treated poorly. As a matter of fact, our waiter and hostess were both very courteous. Food was excellent. Chef's cut New York strip was on point and the seafood platter was excellent. The only reason why I gave four stars instead of five is due to the ambiance, it felt a little dead in there that night, but overall very pleased."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It started off with our awesome waiter recommending a martini for me that was exactly what I wanted and then the shrimp cocktail was delicious served on dry ice, the presentation was beautiful. The horseradish was HOT just how I like it. The chopped salad was so good, loved the vinagrette dressing. The bone in filet was so tender and flavorful and cooked to perfection. The steak was served on a 400 degree plate. It was soooo nice to have a very hot steak. Very classy. The lobster mashed potatoes were awesome and the asparagus and spinach were cooked perfectly. The service was phenomenal. Never have I had such exceptional service from start to finish. What an absolutely wonderful place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had great dinners at this establishment over the years and have hosted several business functions here and at Ocean Club in Scottsdale and Vegas. In my opinion, the management, food, and overall service have historically been good, which is why I have stayed a loyal personal and business customer. We experienced a pretty serious problem this evening and the manager on duty, Shawn, was absolutely appalling. She was world-class unprofessional- I have to say, if there was a medal awarded for worst customer service, Shawn wins the entire podium-gold, silver and bronze. The servers I have had over the years at the Mastro's restaurants have been excellent; sadly, this manager was jaw-droppingly unprofessional, and relegated City Hall's customer service to a ridiculous state where I seriously found myself looking around hoping to find I was on some sort of TV prank show. The insulting interaction we had with Shawn tonight will keep us from visiting a Mastro's again or ever contracting a future business program at a Mastro's establishment. Based on this encounter, I'm quite sure I'm not the first to lodge a complaint against this manager and hope to see Mastro's City Hall do something to remedy its reputation- the rest of the City Hall staff and the future patrons of this restaurant deserve better than this level of customer interaction."}
{"text":"We just got back from a fabulous meal at Mastro's City Hall.  I've never written a review about them before, but I thought it was time. Everything about the meal was exceptional from the service, ambiance to the food. We had the Dungeness crab cocktail and shrimp cocktail which were both super fresh. Then the steaks and king crab legs along with scalloped potatoes and sugar snap beans. I forgot to mention the excellent vodka martini's. Our server brought us two different vodkas that we had never tried and they were both excellent.  I might just switch from Belvedere! There are many choices for a great meal in Scottsdale, but Mastro's City Hall is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"It s a nice place but also busy. I liked the food and the music. Make a reservation because it is really busy."}
{"text":"It's got some good food but its overrated and very pricey if you are having big group I suggest Steak 44 is much more reasonable and great staff no need to wait for table.."}
{"text":"High ratings!  Absolutely fabulous food and service. Very hot bar scene and great people watching place. Had the bone in filet and it was out of this world. A definite stop."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how fabulous this place was! The Filet with Truffle Butter is an absolute must. It was the best filet I have ever tasted. The mushrooms and creamed spinach were an added bonus! We sat outside on the heated porch and it was perfect for our family. I was a little concerned about being cold but the heaters overhead and beside us left is quite toasty while we dined.  Our waitress, Sara, was exceptional.  This will be on our list of favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"It feels oh so fitting to be writing my first Yelp review for my favorite restaurant in town. Seriously, if you're thinking about going here, don't hesitate for a second. From the atmosphere to the food and drinks to the crowd, City Hall is what they call, \"doing it right.\"  I noticed a few of the negative reviews had to do with ambiance and the noise levels in the restaurant. I can understand that if one is referring to the bar area, but if you're looking to have a romantic dinner, plan ahead and ask for a quieter table. This place has an outstanding level of service, and I'm sure they'd do everything in their power to accommodate you.  Now, back to last night. We rolled in about 9:15 to grab a late dinner before heading out for the evening. It was spur of the moment, so a friend and I swooped up a couple bar seats with a prime view of what was going down. Within seconds, we had a couple heavily poured 7&7's and the night was off and running (yes, cocktails are $12 here, and while I frown at that most times, they literally fill your glass with liquor, and then splash it with a mixer. So just sip and enjoy, you'll probably only order 2 at most unless you're a lush).  The bartender asked if we needed menus and I replied, \"Nah, I'm good, make it the Bone In Filet, Rare plus, side of mushrooms.\" If you've never been, I highly recommend doing it the same. These guys are such masters, you can even be the guy who orders his steak at a certain temperature (yes, my friend Scott is THAT guy), and they'll nail it on the head every time. There's very little seasoning and spices if any, just perfectly prepared meat that melts in your mouth, not in your hands. I usually have a tough time paying $25-$30 for a steak, but this one, even at $50, is well worth it in my opinion. Just wish I could enjoy it on a weekly basis ;-)  Before visiting City Hall, I had never experienced a Filet with the Bone in. Even my father who has 30+ years experience in the meat industry had never heard of such a thing. I assure you, if you think it's odd, get over it and sink your teeth into the most amazing piece of meat ever.  Another nice cherry on top is the fact the plate comes out at 1 million degrees. While it's a small struggle to not burn the sides of your hands after a few cocktails, it keeps every bite of your meal HOT until the very last bite. A most excellent touch in my opinion.  While I've ranted and raved about the food, the scene at the bar certainly never sucks. You'll see anything and everything in there. From the guy playing the same Elton John tunes on the piano, to the rowdy group of ladies out for their bachelorette party, to the group of golfers who came over from the Phoenician fired up and ready to rack up a $1000 tab, to the young ladies working the older guys for drinks. It's like a 2-4-1 deal with great food and entertainment ;-) and definitely a must stop the next time you have a craving for the BEST STEAK you've ever had.  Seriously, I want to break into their office and steal an invoice from their meat supplier. They're either getting it from some top secret meat farm, or they're injecting it with crack. I just can't get enough."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! This isn't just dinner, Mastros is an experience! Too many good things to say. I won't be able to attend here regularly because it is pricy, but worth every penny. Highly recommended for at least special occasions!"}
{"text":"MUST READ ?????? today my boyfriend and I decided to go and dine at the restaurant called MASTROS CITY HALL in Scottsdale Az. We had a great experience there considering that it was my first time dining there . We had a wonderful meal and asked to box our food and for the check. Our meal came to 275.00$ so we gave them 350.00$ and told them to keep it due to HIS great service . My boyfriend and I were in such a great mood that we got up and left (after paying for our tab) and started to walk to our car . As we were In The parking lot one of the servers came running after us telling us we forgot our food, as were laughing to the car. I sit in my car and i look in my rear view mirror and I see a man taking a pic of my license plate telling us we didn't pay for our meal . I told him that I gave the  waiter 350.00$ as I'm walking back into the restaurant with him to confirm. We go up to the waiter to confirm as he's looking confused with the tab still in his pocket of his apron 350.00$ EXACT. We come to realize that the GM has never asked the waiter if we paid or not but simply ran after us & at this very moment the GM Jeff was completely embarrassed and couldn't even say a word. I told them how much I couldn't wait to eat at this restaurant as I made my reservation earlier in the day as I was shopping at Scottsdale Fashion center . I took my money (350.00)back and still gave the waiter 150.00$ TIP due to his EXCELLENT service shook his hand and walked out, because the problem was not wit the waiter it was with MANAGEMENT . I'm not quite sure if this was because we weren't dressed for the occasion, which we were not dressed terribly neither , but I felt totally violated and I think everyone should see this . Please share your opinions and tell me what you think about this. I simply just wanted to eat at a nice restaurant this lovely Wednesday evening and that certainly did not happen."}
{"text":"Such a great experience!  Wait staff was outstanding,  very accommodating,  friendly and quick!  The food was absolutely amazing!  The most tender,  juicy steak I have had in a long time!  I had the bone in filet and my appetizer was the beef carpaccio.  Overall this was one of the best dinners since moving here in January 2014!!"}
{"text":"This is our third time trying this place.  We keep going back because all our friends love this place, but have never once had good service and this time even the food was off.  Our appetizer (crab stuffed mushrooms) arrived barely warm, undercooked, and was literally tossed onto the table by a back waiter.  My steak was blood rare, not the medium rare I ordered.  The lobster tail my husband had was broiled to a crisp, I could actually hear him chewing it from across the table, and that is a very loud restaurant.  And at one point during the meal, management came over to set up the table next to us and were beyond obnoxious.  If you've ever sat at one of the banquette tables, you know how little room there is.  I had an employee bent over the table next to us with her butt literally in my face for about five minutes as she adjusted napkins and glasses and silverware.  And then she shone a light on the glassware, I guess to make sure there were no liptstick smudges, and every piece of glassware was streaked and smudged and etched with scum.  As soon as the light clicked off, it looked beautiful so those lights are dim for a reason.  We went for a special occasion, we will never go back.  For what they charge, the whole experience was an outrage."}
{"text":"Great place, good service! We flew in from California on business and decided to have dinner here. Got reservations right away via open table and our table was ready within 10 minutes if our arrival. Ambience was fun and modern and I LOVED the live music. We ordered drinks after dinner just to stay and enjoy the music some more. FOOD: salad was enormous, but delicious. The bread basket was delicious, pretzel bread was in the assortment! Shrimp prawn cocktail was excellent, they were the largest prawns I've ever seen. I ordered surf and turf with petite filet, hubby ordered bone in ribeye. Lobster was delish, my petite filet was overdone. I ordered medium well, it was well done. Hubby ordered his ribeye medium rare and it was also well done. That was a MAJOR disappointment, but steaks were still good, so we didn't send back. Drinks were good also. Since we enjoyed the music so much, we ordered more drinks. I ended up wishing I could have ended up ordering dessert, but once we paid, the waiter didn't come back to us at all.  Pricey, but overall it was a great experience, and we would go back. Next time I'll order my steak rare! ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and I loved it. The atmosphere, the food, the service was all impeccable. However it is quite a bit more expensive than its competitors who offer the same quality of restaurant so be prepared for that. The atmosphere here is for the young professional which makes it stand out from the rest. Great job."}
{"text":"Mastro's is definitely one of my best places to dine. Quality speaks for itself here, customer service is elite and on top of their game! Came here for my son's birthday, being that I don't live in Scottsdale and from Beverly Hills Ca, I came to visit my son and celebrate a night out with little guy. I knew I couldn't go wrong with Mastro's and wanted to show my son what good service and food is like. For starters we chose the caprese salad, oysters, and scallops. With the good bread and butter on top of that I'm surprised we made it to the entree.... Then he ordered the rotisserie chicken, and for myself, well if it's Mastro's it's going to be the bone in Ribeye! Everything was delicious but the steak was amazing, nice crisp on the outside and medium rare on the inside, delicious and cooked the way I like it! I am a BBQ guru and can make a killer Ribeye, Mastro's was perfect! I remember my son asking me, why did we come here it's very fancy, I responded because it's your birthday and you deserve the best! Being that he turned 14, he sat back and enjoyed it all, especially the complimentary dessert for his birthday. I know Mastro's is part of Mortons corp now but there's no competition hands down! Thank you for the excellent service Mastro's!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only. I've never eaten in the main restaurant here.   I LOVE Mastro's Ocean Club, but I don't really feel the same emotion about Mastro's City Hall. Don't get me wrong - City Hall has great food, most of the time. The problem is Mastro's just isn't consistent. On one occasion I could swear I had the best steak I ever had in my life, but on another occasion I thought my filet was something I accidentally burned on the BBQ. On one occasion, I had amazing oysters, but on another they were not cleaned correctly which ruined the experience. These are just some of the examples of the inconsistency and the reason I just can't bring myself to give City Hall 5 stars like the partner restaurant Ocean Club.   If I were to recommend one of Mastro's restaurants to a friend, I'd tell them to save their money for Ocean Club.  However, I'd like to add that the bar is great at City Hall. So, if you are just going for drinks, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been to the City Hall location quite a few times over the years but this is my first review. We took our exchange student for a farewell dinner and the service, food and ambiance did not disappoint. Staff went above and beyond to ensure the evening was absolutely perfect. We had wedge salads, king crab gnocci, creamed spinach, filets and the tomahawk (medium rare). We finished off with the signature butter cake. Every bite of every dish was absolutely heavenly. Our waiter suggested a wonderful pinot that complemented the meal perfectly (and wasn't insanely priced).  If I could give more than five stars I would. I'm salivating just writing this and CAN NOT WAIT to return."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses I've ever visited. Service, food preparation, and selection were all world class. If you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, you must check this out."}
{"text":"I have been to the Mastro's in Newport and loved the food. Same goes for this place as well. Minus one star since our martini's were pure sugar mix with just a drop of alcohol. Our waiter was an older, cocky man, that didnt even order our dinner until we finished our appetizers AND salad. We sat there almost 3 hours waiting for our food. He was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Mastros never disappoints.  I've been to both in Orange County, Las Vegas, and now Scottsdale.  All have high quality premium steaks, great menu options, and outstanding service.  I recommend the filet, lobster mac and cheese, and save room for the butter cake!"}
{"text":"Best Bone-In Filet Mignon ever. I've been to the one in Scottsdale a few times and the one in Beverly hills, excellent every time."}
{"text":"The service was great, all of the wait staff were friendly and attentive.  Food was over the top!  Everything yummy.  Coming from out of town and receiving the Steakhouse as a recommendation, we didn't really understand that the way most people ordered was to share EVERYTHING, even the steak.  We WAY over ordered and maybe we could have had a suggestion from the person taking our order that it would be too much food for 3 people.  Even after being stuffed, we still had to try the butter cake.  With tip and yes we had a few drinks, it was just under $450.  Quite an expensive dinner for 3, but I don't go all hog wild too often and it was a wonderful treat to end my first Spring Training Adventure and being with wonderful long time friends.   Three words.  Share, share, share!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The wine list more than adequate. The service was good. Only small complaint is the noise level. Went with a group of coworkers for a meeting and had a hard time carrying on conversations. But this was minor as the overall food and atmosphere are great."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and I wish we had more money so we could visit more often, lol. The steak was perfectly cooked to order (medium rare). It had so much flavor and was super tender; cutting it feels like a knife through butter. I found it better than Fleming's and Morton's steaks. For sides, the Sautéed Mushrooms were tasty and not too salty. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese is delicious, tops among the steakhouses we have been to. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes are amazing and flavorful, though quite expensive ($35). The mash is made separately, then large pieces of fresh lobster are stirred in tableside by the waiter, ensuring the mash isn't too lobstery and that it retains the two distinct flavors.  The first time we came, it was our anniversary so we were gifted a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake. It was fluffy and not too overpoweringly chocolatey. The second visit, we had to make sure we tried the Warm Butter Cake, since it has its own Twitter handle and all. It was served warm with ice cream and was topped with freshly whipped cream and assorted fruits. It was delicious. We only finished half, so we took the rest home (including the extra whipped cream), and it still tasted great the next day.  Service was great both times; the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. Overall, they provide a great experience that leaves us wanting to return as soon as we leave."}
{"text":"This may be a superfluous review, as there were lots with high marks already, but I can't resist adding my two cents...  My parents, my husband and I ate here as a celebration for my graduation from my doctoral program back in March.  We were still on East-coast time, so we ate earlier than many - probably around 6 or so.  We parked ourselves - which even in high heels wasn't too far.  There were a few other tables seated ahead of us, but we certainly didn't have to wait to be seated. Our server was friendly and polite the whole evening, even as it got quite busy.  The martini I had was the biggest martini I have ever been served at a restaurant.  The server brought the shaker over and left it at the table - it was enough to fill two very large martini glasses.  Woah!  I am lucky enough to have had many an excellent steak, and the filet at Mastro's was at least as good as the best I've ever had - if not better.  (And I'm inclined to go with the latter.)  All the food at the table was delicious, and we all enjoyed our meals tremendously.  Although, I must say, after two huge martinis, and wine with dinner, I don't remember what anyone had for dessert.  *blushes*   Anyway,  my experience was absolutely fantastic and I would clearly dine there again if I had the chance."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of steak houses in the Scottsdale area where my wife and I were planning a vacation, I decided to go with Maestro's City Hall due to the abundance of positive reviews of lack of negative reviews.  Yelpers definitely steered me in the right direction as this was one fantastic all around experience!   I have eaten at many high end steak houses in major cities, such as Charlies in Orlando, Del Friscos and W Steakhouse in Vegas, and The Palm in Dallas.  I have no qualms in saying that the Bone In Ribeye (my staple!) at Maestro's was the best out of all of them!  The steak literally could have doubled as a dessert - it almost had a brown sugar taste to the outer crust while the perfectly cooked medium rare center oozed out delicious juices to mix with my Maestro's Potatos (a highly recommended side that is much more affordable then the Lobster mashed potatoes which I decided to pass on after reading yelp reviews)  The wife had a filet which was cooked to her liking (but not mine since it was medium well, lol) which she also enjoyed.  Last but not least, I didnt see much about this on Yelp, but do NOT pass up the warm butter cake for dessert.  I am not even a dessert fan and rarely even order it - but the wife was in the mood for something sweet and the waitress recommended this one, which was one of their specialities.  Not only was the warm butter cake delectable, but the bowl of home made whipped cream that came in a HUGE bowl could have stood alone as a worthy entry on the dessert menu. It was like eating ice cream. I shudder to think how many calories were in that dessert but it was totally worth it!  I also give the service 5 stars.  I made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Friday night two days in advance via OpenTable. I did take the Yelp advice and call afterwards to ensure that we were seated in the main dining area (good advice as the bar when you first entered was slightly loud, although not as loud as some reviewers seem to make it out to be).    We were seated within 5 minutes of showing up and dined in the Main dining area as requested.  Our server was extremely attentive without being overbearing, made good wine pairing suggestions, and really made the experience worthwhile.  Our bill (1 cocktail, Two steaks, 1 side, 2 glasses of wine, 1 dessert, 2 dessert apertifs plus 25% tip) came out to $230 ... about what I expected and well worth every penny!   Lastly, this is a nice establishment and we dressed up - but there were people coming in with shorts, baseball jerseys, etc ..."}
{"text":"Bone in ribeye is a must. Dig the live music. Never had a bad experience. One of my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale. Great service."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Mastros Ocean Club! The atmosphere is very seductive and captivating, when you walk in your greeted with welcoming smiles from managers hostesses and staff.. They have amazing live performers, one of them being a piano player who sings up to date tunes while playing! I was so impressed that I thought it was the actual singer of the song haha. The cocktails are exactly what you would desire when your having a night out with friends or your  significant other! I ordered filet oscar with lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. The filet was full of flavor and the side dishes complimented the filet very well!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  All the steaks are really good.  They have some seafood there as well and a huge list of wines.  You have to order the sides separate from the steaks.  It's on the high end scale and expensive, but what do you expect in Scottsdale?  They have a great choice of drinks and a great atmosphere.  The only downside is that it's kind of dark and loud.  I was sitting at a table and I could barely here the person across from me.  All around fantastic steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but delicious. Steak was perfect, and the scalloped potatoes were great too."}
{"text":"Save your money and your stomachs, I could make you a better steak blindfolded. The service here was awful, had an older gentlemen who was rude and condescending to us and cut us off in between asking a question. Told me, \"Save the questions for later, let me do the talking\". Steaks came out, and one was raw and not suitable for my pregnant sister in law. The other was overcooked. We were celebrating my brother in laws birthday as well and didn't want to make a big deal about it but we let the server know. The server pulled out his blue light and proceeded to argue with us about how the steaks were cooked. I also had a groupon , and that seemed to upset him - he wanted to take my cell phone to the back and I refused. He absolutely ruined my brother in laws birthday. We let Mastros corporate know, and got no response to them. There are far better steakhouses out there where they don't treat you like you owe them something and do also get back to you when you are unhappy."}
{"text":"I visit Scottsdale every February to spend time with my family, and we always spend at least one evening at City Hall. Every meal we have ordered has been superb, and the service is second to none. The seafood tower is a perfect appetizer for a group to share. The steaks are always prepared accurately to order, and the a la carte sides are all wonderful. I've visited many steakhouses, from NYC's Peter Luger to a few of Las Vegas's finest, and City Hall is up there with the best!"}
{"text":"A venerable favorite in Scottsdale ..... $$$$ but worth it.....  The lobster mash is beyond luxurious. Sin cake dessert is easily split between 3 or 4.   A must go when in town"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Great cocktails, terrific wine, terrific food. We have been here with 2 other couples without our kids for dinner and had a really good time."}
{"text":"Great dinner as usual. Guaranteed high quality service and food.  A close friend and I went to Mastro's for his birthday dinner. Sarah was our server and she was extremely pleasant and attentive.  We started dinner with a glass of wine (Trefethen Cab) and my friend had a beer.  We started dinner with a shrimp cocktail, the horseradish is strong but very good . . . Cleared my sinuses. We ordered the Mastros house salad, the wedge, two bone in rib eyes, creamed spinach and the mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was perfectly preferred and tasted great!  Sarah surprised my friend with a Birthday Butter cake which we devoured even after being stuffed.  I highly recommend Mastro's for special occasions, romantic evenings, business dinners and just to treat yourself.   Thank you for a wonderful night Mastro's!  I will be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Scottsdale on vacation and had dinner here on April 29th.  I made a reservation through open table for 7pm and when we arrived, we were taken to our table right away. I noticed in other reviews that people complained about waiting, but at 7pm on a Wednesday night, we had no problem.  The server was very good-very personable, asking where we were from and even let us know that a Mastro's in Chicago had just opened-he went over the menu with us and also recommended a bottle of red wine to us.  The Camus 2008 Cab they have would have been nice, but we went with his recommendation as it was a lot less!  I had the bone in ribeye medium rare and the girlfriend had the filet, both fantastic!  Our dessert was the butter cake, which was a large serving and was delicious!  We enjoyed our meal and service was outstanding AND the next day I received a call from Mastro's asking me how my experience was. I had one minor complaint and that was about the lighting as it was very dark and hard to read the menu-I have noticed this in a lot of high end restaurants though. I know it's to set the mood, ambiance, etc., but still hard to read--not a big deal though as everything else was top notch."}
{"text":"Back in 2015, I wrote a scathing review about this place and the monster size roaches that were there joining us for our family dinner. Mastros' finally wrote back, asked me to give contact information and NEVER got back to us. We are still waiting and it's now 2017. We have not been back since. It ruined the dinner. We ended up leaving from just the way we were treated there, and ended up eating down the street at this po dunk place, 'it was a holiday' and we were highly disappointed in this family reunion. Good thing we didn't hold our breath!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in the valley.  I typically order the chop salad and Brussels sprouts, with a Gin Martini .  Service is impeccable, as expected for a high-end steak house.  Love the service at the bar and you always meet some interesting peeps!  Got to love North Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Only had drinks there on my birthday, but the experience was pretty bleh.  Inattentive and condescending service.  I realize this is part of a small chain of jerkish, faux-high end restaurants catering to cougars, the douches who are their prey, and the creepy, lecherous old guys who are their alimony meal ticket, but you'd think they could muster a smile for a guy paying their prices.  As to food, I'm plenty happy with the steaks at Ruth's Chris to risk suffering through their uninviting dining room and elitist service again.  I realize I'll have to find my condescending bleached blond hookup for that night somewhere else, but so be it.  UPDATE: Got an email from the manager in regards to this post; it was total form email with no sincerity to it."}
{"text":"Saved all my spare change, didn't eat out for a month- all worth the $$$$ we spent here. This is my fiancé favorite steak place and he's pretty hard to impressed. When we dine out, I always have him rate each restaurant on a scale of 1-10- most received 6 or 7. Mastro's received 11!  We both ordered rib eyes cooked to perfection; lobster Mac and cheese and cream corn to shared. We also ordered the sea food tower as an appetizer and oh man that was probably one of the coolest deliveries at a restaurant. Can't wait to save enough money and enjoy this deliciousness all over again!"}
{"text":"Excellent high quality steak house .  Prime steaks and very good service .  I could go without the bathroom attendants in men's and ladies restrooms.  That is so 80's"}
{"text":"Amazing filet. Maybe best I've ever had. Make sure to get the gnocci side. And they don't tell you but you can get half order sides (that are also half price) so you can try more from the extensive side list."}
{"text":"Mastro's is an elegant and stylish place...warm wood, glass and highly polished slate adorn the area when you walk in...more feminine than some of the other high end steak houses, which I liked.  We were given the choice of the dining room, bar area or outdoor patio for our table, we chose the patio although the bar would have been nice since they had live music.  The patio was small and cozy with ample heat lamps and comfortable chairs.  The wine/cocktail and dinner menus were limited but contained all the steakhouse standards.    When we arrived, we were greeted and seated promptly for our reservation.  Our server was nice - pleasant and professional.  We ordered a few cocktails and glasses of wine (generous pours) and contemplated our dinner choices.    We landed on the Bone In Rib Eye, Double Pork Chop and Filets.  The Rib Eye was more fatty than expected but the flavor was good.  For the filet, I really like a nice char on the outside of my steak, which this one didn't have.  When I cut into the meat it was somewhat stringy.  The flavor was mediocre.  I know our dining companion really enjoyed the pork chop.  Our sides included the Sautéed Spinach, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese and Creamed Corn - all three were tasty but not outstanding.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Pudding Cake with fresh whipped cream and blackberries, which was the true standout in an otherwise ordinary meal.    We enjoyed our food and the cocktails - everything was good but I've had much better and to me quality just didn't live up to the steep price.  I would likely take a pass on Mastro's City Hall next time."}
{"text":"Loved Mastro's forever. This is the place for steak, when in Old Town Scottsdale by far.  The service is always fantastic, food is great. I always order the KC Strip, medium rare every time. (always perfect!) So, that's my recommendation on steak. The sides are great and the butter cake, will knock you out of your chair."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding!!!   This is definitely the place to go and enjoy fine dining - whether to impress someone OR to be impressed, you just can't go wrong. Bobby was our waiter / He did a fine job and throughout our entire dinner the food kept coming at a nice tempo and obviously - tasted fantastic. 4 of us / some drinks & 2 bottles of red wine.   Imma gonna let da pictures speak for dem selves. Filet w Foie gras on top - phagetaboutit Steak Carpaccio - OOOOFA each time we dine here its like being transported into another life.   God Bless America and God Bless Pres Donald Trump - cause this is how we do it on the republican side.  Dessert was their infamous Warm Butter Cake.  Bodda Bing.   Certainly a must once dinner is ova!!!!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing not to L-O-V-E about this place (well, maybe the bill but that's out of the subject :)  It has been hard for me to fall in love with a restaurant here in AZ, but City Hall has never let me down.  The shrimp cocktail is awesome. The size of the shrimp is kind of scary, I wouldn't want to cross paths with them while swimming in the sea!  The shrimps are super clean, meaty, tasteful and the sauce and horse radish is awesome. Great starter.  I had the Argyle pinot noir which was pretty good.  I also ordered the bone-in filet which was delicious, tender, cooked to perfection (which is hard to find).  If I had to criticize anything, I would like to have a little more of light (just a notch)."}
{"text":"Very good food! I took my wife to Mastro's City Hall for our anniversary. Making a reservation was a snap with the Open Table option on Yelp.  The restaurant was a little dark, but I suppose that was just the atmosphere they wanted. We were sat at our table as soon as we walked through the door. The waitress was at the table within a couple minutes and complimentary bread shortly after that.  We both ordered lobster bisque for a starter, which was fantastic, but we could probably have gotten away with one order as the bowls were huge!  My wife got the petite filet and I got the halibut. Both of which were delicious as well. At this point we were both very full, but since it was our first time in the restaurant, the waitress brought us dessert which was even SO good! I couldn't stop eating it even though I was full. It's VERY pricey (hence the four stars and not five) but, would recommend City Hall to anyone that has a special occasion coming up."}
{"text":"Phenomenal dinner with my pops during our vacation to Scottsdale for Spring Training. The food isn't cheap, but what good steakhouse is? The service was first class from start to finish and I wouldn't hesitate to go again."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and small plates.  The ambiance in the bar area was awesome. The appetizers were perfect for sharing.  They came with a bead basket.  I plan to go back often."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best steaks I've ever had.  We started with the seared scallops, which were delicious.  They come out in a bowl soaked in a butter/wine/garlic sauce along with bread to dip.    Ordering was a tough decision.  We each ordered the filet (no brainer), but deciding on sides was tough.  Initially I had planned on the Gorgonzola mac and cheese based on the other reviews here (and the two girls who sat next to us salivating over their side dish), but they had a special side...Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  Basically a half pound of lobster meat in butter soaked mashed potatoes.  Holy crap was it good.  But now we have to go back again to try the mac and cheese.  Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Ambiance, Music, Friendly staff (especially bartender Tammy) we had the steak and seafood, all delicious, the piano bar music was great, not too loud as some places tend to be - Tammy was knowledgeable about wines and we didn't have to wave her down...since this place tends to stay busy!! We love the atmosphere and the people we meet there."}
{"text":"Literally just left Mastro's City Hall and I could not be more disappointed.  Took my best friend here for her big dinner out during her Bachelorette weekend and it was one disappointment after another.  Despite making reservations through OpenTable, we had to wait 15 minutes for our table to be ready. Our drinks from the bar were horrendous. We ordered two classic drinks, a mojito and a Tom Collins and both had to be sent back. We ordered one gnocchi with crab meat and one without and we specified the bride to be is allergic to seafood. When the food arrived, they served the bride the crab meat gnocchi and her whole dish had to be sent back because it was now contaminated. Worst yet was the offer of a special event piece of chocolate cake that we didn't ask for and assumed it was complimentary.  Two minutes later the waitress said the chocolate cake was unavailable and offered us a piece of butter cake which we declined. When the check came there was a charge for $6 for the special event cake we didn't even ask for, and a refund for them same. Overall, it was $300 before tip and tax for five women and incredibly underwhelming. If you want to go to a real steakhouse you're better off going to Capital Grille."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary and we had a wonderful experience. The service was exceptional. After each course the table was crumbed and our server presented each new course eloquently. We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms, followed by the 22 oz Bone in Kansas City strip with lobster mash potatoes. Dessert was the Butter cake with a side of fresh whipped cream. The food was outstanding. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly. The steak was juicy, thick and sizzling with flavor.  And the butter cake was out of this world. My wife had cocktails to which our server knew everything about along with the food. All in all, the experience and the food were worth the price.       Why just four stars then? It would have received give stars if their wine list was a little more versatile such as some old world wines."}
{"text":"My father was visiting from Arkansas and wanted a special dinner. We were not disappointed. The wait staff and support staff are knowledgeable and professional. I had not had that level of service in such a long time. The manager even stopped by our table to see how are meal was. You just don't get the quality of food service like this anywhere. We are already planning another visit when my dad comes next time."}
{"text":"I love the ambience, food and the service.  Best steak house bar none! I've traveled around the world and this restaurant tops all...."}
{"text":"Went here with HIGH expectations...completely lived up to em...service n staff was unbelievably friendly and never missed a beat....caesar salad was a perfect portion...had the 12 oz filet mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes....honestly could be best food i have ever had in my entire life....(drops mic)"}
{"text":"Probably the best steaks in the state. Great service every time I go. You never have to wait for anything to be refilled. Food can take a bit of time but it's worth it. Here are two musts when you go. Sea scallops and butter cream cake. If you're worried about not having room for dessert then order the butter cream cake first.  You won't be disappointed. The main dining area can be quite noisy so request a table in the back dining room it's much quieter and more spread out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are always coming here for special occasions..and have never been disappointed. I've been to a lot of high-class, expensive steakhouses but this one truly stands out. The steaks are always cooked perfectly, the service is phenomenal, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. All the sides we've had have been great, especially the creamed corn, spinach, and twice baked potato. I also love the wedge salad to start. What really stands out from all out delicious meals here is the butter cake. Nothing compares! It may just be the best dessert I've ever had. You must go & get the butter cake. It's especially good along with a cappuccino!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse ever!!! Definitely worth it if you can afford it. The steak is extremely buttery and delicious. The sides are generous portions so think of sharing! Plus the service is beyond amazing. I would definitely recommend the shrimp to start. Make sure to get dessert! The dessert there is to. Die. For. Especially the warm butter cake. Definitely will be returning many times!"}
{"text":"1st time to Cityhall.  Have been to maestros in north Scottsdale.  Menus and prices are pretty identical.  Ambiance was nice, live music in bar.  Food was fantastic! Was a little disappointed in the Alaskan king crab legs as they weren't as big as I would have liked... But, it's a steakhouse and not a seafood joint.  Porterhouse was cooked to perfection.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice steakhouse for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is my fav Mastros in the city. I love all Mastros but the energy at this location sets it apart from all the others. It's a large open dining room which makes for a lovely atmosphere especially on a Friday. Get the filet and cocktail and call it a night ;)"}
{"text":"I went with my husband for Uber drivers outting and someone recommended this place. Not sure I would after our experience. Lol. I couldn't really order steak tonight so I tried the Lobster Bisque. It was ok. It tasted a little too cheesy. My husband's lobster bisque was amazing so maybe the bar was already too high.   My husband ordered the filet mignon and he liked it a lot. Sides we ordered as a group, where it's like a family style. Our sides. -  sauteed broccoli, was ok it was too hard - garlic mashed, nothing to rave about. They were decent. -sauteed mushrooms were the best sides and I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms. -sweet cream corn was ok - Mac and cheese - I didn't like it. Noodles tasted super overcooked.   On service; they were good. A person in our party ordered well-done steak and it came back charred and burnt. She requested the $45 steak to be removed from their bill. (I seriously wanted to take a picture of it, but it wasn't my food) but the server didn't hesitate to remove it off.   Overall experience, we wouldn't go back for the cost of what we paid, no thanks. Save your money and go to Steak 44 lol :)"}
{"text":"OK yes, Mastro's is a very nice restaurant. Personally, I found it a bit too crowded for my taste when I went a few weeks ago on a Friday night.  Parking was a pain in the butt, and had to end up parking far away in the back, but there is valet parking available in the front.  The drinks were overpriced, and we received not-so-great service from the bartender.  When we were seated, we did receive good service. The food itself was OK for a good quality steakhouse, though I was not blown away, until I tried one of the best deserts I've ever had. People, you guys gotta try the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.   Tip- Be advised the Caesar Salad has quite an anchove flavor!"}
{"text":"This is an over priced Scottsdale meat market. If you want a great steak go down the street to Flemmings. The 2 stars was because the service was good. But the food was expensive and not top quality. There are a lot if steak houses in and around Arizona. And since I'm not a middle aged women looking for a rich husband... We won't be back."}
{"text":"Picture it. Oscar night. Boyfriend's birthday. Reservations made for 530. There was no one in the restaurant, except one other table. We sat in the Piano lounge. It was okay, until they sat 4 young guys right next to us, the were loud , rude and obnoxious. Then our food came out...so excited to have the lobster mashed potatoes, the lobster could not even be poked with a fork. It was so rubbery...Yuck...and then add the increasing loudness of the idiots next to us it ruined our evening. They did take the lobster mash off our bill but I will stick to Fleming's."}
{"text":"This is one of those huge steak houses where everything is big from the room to the portions. No intimate romantic dining here but if you want a good steak and want to take a group out to dinner this is definitely your place. Vibrant Bar Scene, Fit for Foodies, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Special Occasion, Hot Spot"}
{"text":"My sister and I go there often.  The ambiance is amazing. We enjoy having drinks there and sitting in the bar area. Enjoy watching the bartenders shake those drinks.  The steaks are decadent.  All their food is amazing."}
{"text":"Had a group of 6 people tonight in the bar high tops. The service was horrible. The server, never stated her name by the way, took forever to bring us our drinks, forgot my baked potato with my steak. I had to ask her where it was she stayed it's on its way I'm more than half way thorough my steak. My potato came after my steak arrived. We ordered an expensive bottle of wine she brings 1 glass for one of the people we were with. My fiancé went to complain and the server heard him and interrupted him and said \"if you want to talk about me then tell me to my face.\" Are you kidding me?? This is fine dining?? I've worked in the restaurant industry as a server for almost 10 years and in fine dining. the waitress in he bar at city hall with dark brown curly hair pulled back has the worst attitude. We will no longer be coming back. She ruined our experience and our night."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying, I rarely rate a restaurant with 5 stars! But Mastros is always top notch, and this time we went was no different.  Last night it was my husband's birthday and his choice was mastros. Now why city hall v. mastros, thats simple we live in Tempe! City Hall is closer and it allowed us to stop by Nordstroms before so he could pick out his gift.  Well we arrived a little early before the rest of our party  so we could enjoy some cocktails in the lounge. Yes the drinks are over priced, but I understand where I am so it is ok. My husband got a vodka martini with blue cheese olives. Now you have to understand not eveywhere has blue cheese olives, so this was huge. I took the bartender's recommendation as to a glass of pinot noir, it was delicious!  Once the rest of our party arrived we were seated. As soon as we are seated, the bread arrives. Now most restaurants bring bread to the table, but not all restaurants have warm pretzel bread. My husband and my brother requested a extra basket of pretzel bread!  For starters we had the oysters and shrimp. Ok this is why I LOVE this place, they have the biggest shrimp anywhere. I have been to many steakhouses all over the valley but none have this size shrimp, and none have atomic horseradish. Aww atomic horseradish is the best thing EVER! I hate when you get mild horseradish. Not sure what mastros does to the horseradish,but having my sinuses cleared is truly an amazing experience!  My brother opted for a ceasar salad, which he enjoyed. It was a nice size and definetly could be shared. Not too long ago we ate at Capital Grille and found their salads very small, so this was good.  Everyone at the table got the filet. I actually split the filet with my sister,and later found out that there was not split charge, another plus. Anyways, the filet was juicy and well flavored. Excellent!  For sides, my brother has the twice baked, which is one of his favorites. The rest of us shared the steamed asaparagus and wasabi mashed potatoes. The wasabi mashed were amazing. I was surprised! But they had a nice hint of wasabi, very good.  For desert, since it was my husband's birthday he got a complimentary butter cake with creme fraiche (mastro's signature desert). Well lets just say I had to be separated from the cake!!"}
{"text":"Went for our 2 year anniversary and couldn't have been better! Wait staff was great the food was top notch definitely worth the coin they gave us a huge dessert on the house fresh whipped cream with ice cream cake and fruit it was insane"}
{"text":"This place was good, but not the best steak house I have been to and for the cost I thought it would match my fave place $200 (+ tip) for 2 people. The portions are huge! BUT... I would have rather had smaller portions then a bunch of take home boxes. Everything was delicious. Service was good. Live singer in the bar area was a nice touch too. Definitely nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stayed at a local hotel and asked for a steakhouse recommendation and am so glad we got got Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse as the place to go.  The steak was definitely the best steak I've ever had in my life (i had the porterhouse).  Also had a dessert, lemonchello sorbet, which was great.  The service was as great as you'd expect.  The price is up there, but we got more than we paid for.  Final note is this place has a hefty military discount.  Even if you are not military, it is worth patronizing a place that has such respect for our service men and women.  If there was a heavenly form of meat, this is it."}
{"text":"Be prepared to share or have plenty of leftovers to take home, as these are NOT individual servings.  Extremely dark restaurant...also seem to be the SugarBaby-Sugar Daddy dining restaurant of choice, and I am NOT hatin'!  Fresh delicious veggies, yummy melt in your mouth meat, the Ahi was just \"okay\", and the butter cake is alright but I don't get the big fuss.  We were seated in the tables by the bar, and it was pretty loud and they had a couple singing and playing a guitar. I think it was okay music, but pretty hard to tell as thy seemed to have the speakers jacked up so high you could barely understand what they were playing & singing.  BUT, I still liked it and would def go back!  Oh yeah and two words \"pretzel\" and \"bread\"...Soft, warm, and yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband I visited Mastro's in September for our anniversary dinner.  Based on reviews, the menu and the prices, we were expecting to be blown away and we just weren't.  The service was very good, don't get me wrong, but the food was very blah.    We ordered the oyster's Rockefeller for an appetizer, which was nice, but I'm not the biggest fan of the dish--my husband is.  He ordered the New York Strip and I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for our entrees along with the scalloped potatoes for a side.  While the quality of the proteins were excellent and they were cooked perfectly, both the beef and fish lacked in flavor.  Frankly it seemed like they were only seasoned with a little salt and oil--nothing else.  We could make something better at home.  For the prices we were paying, we expected nirvana and it just fell flat.  The scalloped potatoes were so greasy it made my stomach upset.   The best part of the dinner was the complimentary chocolate cake with fresh made whipped cream--it was to die for.  Another thing that bothered us but seems to be a hit with others was the smell of the brown butter for the restaurants signature butter cake.  The entire restaurant smelled of burnt butter, which was upsetting my husband's stomach!    A nice touch of the restaurant was a follow up call on the Monday after to ask how our experience was.  I shared that we felt like the food lacked flavor, of which the caller was surprised.  Despite the promise of an excellent fine dining experience, we didn't experience it. Unfortunately, we won't be coming again."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I go about twice a month for date night. Sometimes we sit at the bar to get the entertainment factor. You'll know what I mean when you go and I ain't talking about the live music. For a more romantic cozy dinner we sit in the dining room. The lobster mashed potatoes are a delight to the senses!  Anything on the menu is delicious. I love the 12 oz filet, it only cost a few bucks more than the 6 oz so it is a better \"deal\". The place is not cheap, But it is by far the most delicious steak and seafood you will ever eat!  The butter cake with fresh berries and made to order whipped cream is a heavenly dream. What are you waiting for!  Get in your car and go!!!!!"}
{"text":"A special place for special occasions indeed. The bill will shock you at $100 per person plus wine. But the beef was absolutely amazing along with the service."}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Maestro's restaurant. I took my wife here for Valentines Day this year and we were both very disappointed! Expecting a romantic dinner with an ambiance to go along with the theme was what we were expecting.  When the host led us outside into the City Hall Court yard, we were not amused. Our view was wing C & D of the City Hall and our table was barely enough room to hold the menus. Although the restaurant tried to create an ambiance to fit the romantic evening, they failed miserably.  Actually, I was quite annoyed and embarrassed the entire evening. I wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber to treat its customers so disrespectful, especially while other guest are inside the restaurant enjoying a candle lit dinner, listening to live music, and enjoying the atmosphere of a high quality restaurant .  My second experience here has definitely left a bad taste in my mouth regardless the quality and reputation of the restaurant.  It would have been nice to be told in advance what our seating options were. Like, at the time we made the reservation so that we could decide whether or not we wanted to eat at Maestros or not! Instead they took as many reservations as they possibly could and shuffled us out to the business park break area! We literally were looking into offices with cubicles and the hem of my wife's dress kept kissing the dirty concrete. If we wanted to have a picnic, we would have gone to the park and wore shorts! Not to mention the waiters and waitresses had on soiled white jackets that looked like they had no been laundered in a week. They are probably used to being in the dim lighting INSIDE the restaurant so they didn't bother to make sure their outfits were squared away. Besides the wine and lobster, I could have stayed at home and been more comfortable!"}
{"text":"Food was good but I wouldn't say out of this world.  Had the shrimp cocktail, crab legs and each ordered a rib eye with a side.  Got a bottle of wine also and desert.  Bill came to over 300 dollars.  Food was good but hard to justify that kind of money.  Had a steak that was just as delicious at Texas Roadhouse for what we tipped the waiter.  One and done for us.  With this place, you pay for status I guess."}
{"text":"When you think of high-end service ever restaurant this is what you expect Mastro's has it down to a science let's start with this service our waiter I should say Waiters were fantastic never needed to ask for anything it was on the table before you even knew you wanted it can glasses never or half full and the timing of the food coming out with perfect now for the food start off of calamari which I would see it was just ok maybe a little undercooked but still tasty the Caesar salad was great one of the best I've had in a long time creamy not intruding and dressing also have a 22 ounce porterhouse very flavorful maybe need a little more seasoning medium rare perfect now they're butter cake is the greatest cake I've ever had in my life hot right out of the oven what kind of a crunchy outside layer a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with strawberry puree so good I almost ordered to if you sit in the bar like we did after 7 the music gets really loud so it's kind of hard to talk this is definitely a place to come I will be back soon as I can"}
{"text":"I've never reviewed a restaurant before because I appreciate the effort that restaurant owners put into owning their own business but this food was appalling and I couldn't sleep knowing others could look at these reviews and think they were actually going to a decent restaurant. The food was incredibly over salted and I couldn't bring myself to eat another bite. The live music matched the food making me want to claw my ears out. All in all the experience was not something I would want to go through again."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My fiancé and I were in town from Houston and of all the steakhouses we considered we are glad we picked this one.   We started with the black truffle albacore tuna sushi appetizer at the servers suggestion.  She was right on, this was some of the best sushi we have had, in Phoenix no less! Silky smooth and full of flavor.  For the main course, we both had 18 oz bone in filets, Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese and King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi (the real winner of the bunch).  The steaks were flavorful and cooked to perfection, the Mac n Cheese was very tasty, the Gnocchi was out of this world!! At $30 we were expecting a lot and it delivered big time.   After we could barely move, we still felt compelled to try the famous butter cake. We were glad we did! Simple and delicious, a real treat.  Our server was as good as the food, she made great suggestions and was very accommodating .  This was one of the if not the best meal we have had and we've been luck enough to eat at some great restaurants over the years.    If your in Phoenix and want the best, look no further than Mastro's City Hall."}
{"text":"We were told their house specialty is the bone-in fillet. We ordered the 12 oz. version, and it surely lived up to its reputation! As with most true steakhouses, it was served alone on a 400 degree plate. The sides are family style, every one we say looked great. We had the Au Gratin potatoes, and while they were drenched in cheese, they still accompanied the steak very well. Wine selection is decent, though overpriced. Good feel to the dining room, and service was good at 8PM on a Friday night.  We'll be back the next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant of all time. Everything about this place is amazing. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for. Convenient location right in the heart of Scottsdale - make sure you get a reservation, because it's popular!  Service: so friendly and attentive, even when the place was packed! Our waitress offered a bunch of awesome recommendations, and the timing that our drinks/courses were brought out was perfect. We didn't feel rushed at all.  Ambiance: a little loud, but that just adds to the swanky-chic-this-place-is-so-cool vibe. Definitely not a casual place; most people were dressed up, so just be ready for that. They usually have awesome live music.  Drinks: we tried all of the drinks. Wine, gin-and-tonics, manhattans, tequila shots, more wine. (We were celebrating, ok?) All delicious. Definitely have some skilled bartenders.  FOOD: honestly everything was amazing. And we essentially ordered the entire menu. My favorites: mac & cheese, roasted brussel sprouts, lobster mashed potatos, and the filets were perfect melt-in-your-mouth tender."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so delicious. It's really pricey but nice for an occasional splurge or for celebrating a special occasion. Service was impeccable, food was just as good."}
{"text":"Always a fun atmosphere, warm chic bar with live music which is usually the location for our meals last night we opted for the dining room.  My friend and I started with the shrimp cocktail and decided to pay for for a few extra shrimp since that was the only appetizer we were having (seafood is always fresh) I always get the petite filet 8oz which is plenty for me.  I am extremely picky with how my meat is prepared and they have always done it perfectly medium rare, I always order medium rare more on the rare side and usually at restaurants it comes medium rare, at City Hall they nail it for me right between rare and medium rare.  My friend is clearly more of a meat eater ordered the 22oz Bone in Ribeye he killed it all 22oz's of it.  Our sides consisted of creamed spinach (always one of my favorites) we usually get lobster mac and cheese (to die for) tonight we got the scalloped potatoes because my friend wanted something different.  In general scalloped potatoes are not my favorite but this creamy rich concoction was by far the best scalloped potatoes I have ever had.  We were in a food coma at the point that AMEX sent over \"Mastro's\" signature butter cake for booking the reservation through American Express.  Sweetness overload with the butter cake and iced cream but always amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh no way, another five star review for Mastros!? Would have never figured!   I was reluctant to write a review for Mastros because it already has several hundred glowing reviews on it's page. It is not a fickle business where one Yelp review can make or break it's listing, but I felt, after tonight I must.  I have dined at Mastros a few times before, each time exceptional. The food is always top notch (as one could only hope for with the prices) and the service is next to perfect. However, tonight our server went above and beyond.   As we scrapped the last pieces of perfectly done filets off our plates, and chocked down the last savory bites of Mac and Cheese our waiter came over to check in on us. He could see the defeat in our faces; Stuffed, about to explode, on the verge of a food coma. After briefly chatting with us he found my mom was visiting her college student son from the East Coast.   He asked if we had room for desert, a groggy \"no\" we both replied. He told my mom that the experience wouldn't be complete without butter cake. I agreed with him, I said \"It really won't, it's part of Mastors culture. It's almost sacrilegious to come here and not try it, at least once.\" She looked at me for a second and said \"It does sound good, but I can't I'm just to full.\" I looked at her and sighed, agreeing.   My shook his head and left, a few minutes later he returned with a butter cake in hand. He said he could see the tough decision we had, and didn't want my mother leaving with out a bite. He said \"don't worry about the cost, this one is on me. \"  Now I have been to plenty of restaurants before, and worked in them as well. Usually they will comp a drink, or a split appetizer   if their was something wrong with the meal, or a long wait. But never if everything was perfectly fine.   So to my waiter I believe your name was Derek, I don't know if you ever see these, or have one of the managers read praises from the night. But these Five stars are for you. Again thank you for the free Butter Cake and overall awesome dinning experience."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Always incredible.  Great steak and lobster mashed potatos.  Only thing that's funny is that they brag that their cows are corn fed.  Um, hello.  Worst thing ever to feed a cow.  They should be grass fed you fools!  A cows body is not capable of properly digesting corn.  Otherwise, amazing.  Only complaint is that Ocean's Club is far more posh and a better experience, but too far from our house."}
{"text":"I was only going to give it 1 star but the bread (especially the pretzel bread and the olive bread) and wine were at least good!  My friend and I are on a quest to find the best tuna tartar in the valley....why?  Well, why not, I guess!  She'd googled something like \"best tuna tartar\" and City Hall came up in her search.  So sad it did because I wish I had my time and money back.  They need to send someone over to The Mint to see how tuna tartar should be made!  The price for the tuna tartar was $18 which I'd HAPPILY pay if it was GOOD but it was awful!  Instead of a nice bowl of tender delicious tuna like we had at The Mint, we got a tri-level blob on our plate.  The bottom layer was what I believe were crushed up chow mein noodles of some sort....bland and boring!  The next layer, which was about 3/4 of the blob, was guacamole....WEIRD!  And it wasn't even a nice bold flavorful guac!  Like the chow mein noodles, it was bland and boring.  Then in a VERY thin layer smeared on the top were some small pieces of raw tuna.  And guess what?  It was bland and boring too!  No surprise there, huh?  So we very disappointed to say the least.  We also opted to try the seared ahi tuna.  Another mistake!  I've eaten a LOT of ahi in my life (Salt Cellar always has beautiful ahi!!) and when I order seared ahi, I expect it to be put on a very hot grill for just a moment and then turned over for another moment and then off so that the inside is still nice and raw.  Everywhere I've had seared ahi from one side of the US to the other has been prepared that way.  At City Hall it was cooked all the way through and it really ruined it for me.  It almost seemed as if we were eating canned tuna.  Not impressed!  We would have complained to our server if we ever saw her!  I was finally able to flag her down and get our bill but by then, we didn't have time to say anything as we needed to leave.  Kudos to the valet at least! I couldn't find my ticket and was searching my purse for it when all of a sudden my friend said \"hey, he's got your car already!\"   The place was pretty full so I was pretty impressed that he remember what car we were driving.....  Onward and upward to our next stop on our tuna tartar tasting tour....."}
{"text":"Service was very professional and we were happy with the service we received . Minus one person who brought us over a wine bottle and I made a comment it seemed like a busy night and that was awesome . What I got back from the man was they were always busy and this was nothing that a place like this one is fortunate even for new customers they appreciate everyone no matter what value something really uncomfortable was said making us feel like this must be our first time at a place like this ??? Ugh first of all we've paid 150.00 for one steak at a wonderful steak house we love on a random Monday for no occasion we appreciate a great piece of meat... Besides him our server and the bus boys were magnificent and honestly very attentive. The valet outside was so nice to we appreciated our night out !"}
{"text":"Noisy bar , fair service , non expensive wine , terrible garlic bread - cold soggy no flavor !  Very good Porter House pork chop , non impressive Jalapeño tuna , so so bone in rib eye steak ! Very good Key lime pie, non good Chocolate layer cake , a disappointment visit ."}
{"text":"Very good choice tonight!!!! Great food, great service and worth the money!!!! Will be back again for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner in the piano bar area.  Seafood tower, mack & cheese, and butter cake - Everything was delicious. Well dressed crowd. Great atmosphere.  Great martinis.   Great end to my trip to Phonix.    Pretty loud but that's what I expected."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse. Fantastic food. Great atmosphere. Very fun. Perfect for a group. It is loud in the bar area, but we were with a group on a Friday night so it was exactly what we were looking for. It is very expensive, but worth the money"}
{"text":"This place was soooo delicious. First time here. Had a reservation at 9:30pm for a group of 5 of us. It did take like 25 minutes for us to get seated. While we waited they brought out champagne for us to have. There was also live music in the lounge to keep everyone entertained. When we arrived at the table, it was set up very pretty. White table cloth with black napkins and a cute center piece. I ordered a filthy martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and caper berries on the side. They gave us the shaker for the drinks. I refilled my glass 2 more times with the shaker! We ordered a dozen shrimp and 10 crab claws as our appetizer. It came out on a silver tiered platter with ice! It was so pretty!!! They did not skimp on the size of the shrimp or the claws. Dinner is ordered a la carte here. I had a lobster bisque soup, the 22 oz bone in ribeye with a slab of bacon. The table shared sides of creamed spinach and crab gnocchi. The soup had nice chunks of lobster inside. The steak was cooked perfectly to my medium rare. The sides were delicious! We ended the night sharing a dessert of their warm butter cake. It was sweet and fluffy and came with clotted cream!Excited to go back again."}
{"text":"One doesn't need a long review for this place. If you're out to get the best steak and seafood in the valley, and price is no factor. you will not do better than this place. We frequent it several times a year when we bring clients in, and they are money every time! Meats are cooked to absolute perfection, and they have an extensive wine list. Always 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Of all the Mastro's restaurants, this is our favorite. Not that we don't like them all, but the staff just seems extra special at City Hall. Of course, you just have to have a few drinks at the bar with Christian before getting your table. Great drinks, great scene.  Once you sit down, let the experience begin. From your first pretzel roll through your last bite of dessert, it's just as good as it gets. The wine list is one of the best and we think these are bar-none the best steaks in town. If you haven't had them and feel like splurging, the lobster mashed potatoes are so good it doesn't even make sense."}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband birthday here last Saturday instead of Steak 44 that we love. It was a long discussion before we made our mind up to have the reservation here. We always go to steak 44 so we thought to give Mastro's a try since they have a lot of positive reviews as well. Oh boy, didn't we regretted it?. First of all, service here felt like we were watching a ROBOT show. How hard it is to smile? seriously. When you greet people you smile and make them comfortable while waiting for their table. As much as this place look elegant, nothing really were impressive that I want to comeback and bring my friend here. It was too noisy and too dark, can't barely see your food. Why I give at least 3 stars it was because the lobster Bisque and Shrimp cocktail were great, those deserved 3 stars otherwise I would have just put 1 star for the experience. Our first time and probably our last. Sorry, just sharing my honest opinion."}
{"text":"The best food, drinks, service, scenery, and anything else you can think of. If you are coming from out of town, and you feel like doing it big, go to Mastros. Steak is unbelievable (I recommend splitting different steaks if you are eating with multiple people) I mean where else are you going to see 400 degree plates!? Waiters/waitresses are very nice and help you if you need it (remember they are always right). You won't leave satisfied without getting the butter cake I'm serious. It's so beautiful I swear God Blessed it."}
{"text":"So in my search for something that was good an luxurious I came across Mastro's (weird name, one want to think Maestro's non?). I reserved a table and the plan was to go there, have drinks and then sit down for dinner before we head out into the weird Old Town of Scottsdale.   We came and the girls up front was very accommodating and since we were early they tried to seat us quickly. Very nice and they really didn't have to, but still nice. I must say the drinks were ok. I felt the style and flair was on par but the quality wasn't just there. This was the overall opinion in my party.   We sat down and our waiter was funny yet professional He could not be stumped. And as we put in our orders, the evening continued. Then we had a good conversation with a very passive aggressive sommelier about what wine we felt we wanted. A sommelier shouldn't be a yes-man (or woman in this case) but not have such snobbish attitude when asked a few questions. I was surprised about this. Very.  We had fun and we ate and we drank. We all had steaks. Decent in size and quality. And here is the most amazing thing of all.. the meat was tender, but very salty. I immediately suspected tenderizing methods - which in all actuality is beneath an establishment like this.  The establishment itself is very nice... a bit loud, but very beautiful and stylish.   In the end we had a good time and the service was amazing... but the sommelier and the quality of the meats was not up to snuff. There was a few sides that was also very plain. I guess I just expected more. I will go to another place next time. There was just too many things that didn't feel right with this place."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 18th anniversary tonight.  We had always loved City Hall and had our 14th year anniversary dinner here. Tonight it was just lacking. From the bar staff to the dinner/drink waiters. The food was well below the quality I have come to expect and was no where near the value of what we paid. The waiters were disinterested and went long periods before returning.  The porterhouse was not the quality it should have been, I grill better at home. The butter truffle the waiter recommended was 15 bucks and not that great. I should have bought a scotch instead to wash down the steak.  My wife's chilean sea bass looked like a piece of bread. I won't go on further but obviously I will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"Great steak and sides! I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The service is definitely on their game. I will be back again to wine and dine before hitting a night on the town."}
{"text":"Over priced!  Under serviced!  Loud! Not romantic in the least!   There are so many other places to go for a much better experience. I have eaten at a number of Mastro concepts over the years.  It is very obvious they have been purchased. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for apps and drinks in the bar it was very good and the band was good too. Good energy and fun."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Remarkable service. Beautiful atmosphere. One of the best steakhouses I have visited n the last couple of years."}
{"text":"The wait staff was excellent, the food very good, the atmosphere was calm and soothing.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Amazing.  You Must Order:  1) Shrimp Cocktail (served on a steaming platter with delicious and spicy horseradish) 2) Bone-in Filet (one of the best steaks I have had) 3) Warm Butter Cake (it doesn't matter how full you are, just order it - it's life changing)   Of course, the bread bowl they set on the table is amazing (especially the pretzel bread), but you will regret filling up on too much bread because the rest of the meal is even better.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will definitely be eating dinner here."}
{"text":"I rented a room at City Hall for my fathers birthday party. The entire event from beginning to end was so perfectly executed. Suzy is this locations event coordinator and she was fantastic about sending me all menu options, customization options, and pricing along with times. The room rental had a minimum spending point of 1,500. With a few bottles of wine and premium food selections, it wasn't hard to reach.  When I arrived at 5:00 for the 5-8pm reservation there were no delays and I was immediately taken back to a room with a fully dressed table along with personalized menus. We ordered everything family style. Seafood tower, Wagyu, scallops, filet, ribeye, lobster tails, prawns and Chilean sea bass. We also had three young children with our party and our server was lots of fun and made everyone feel welcome. The service was unrushed and very prompt.   I got rave reviews from all of my family members about what an amazing dinner it was. I will be planning future events at Mastros."}
{"text":"We had a great time and a great meal. Supurb steaks, ambiance, service, and wine list. We need one of these in Richmond, VA!"}
{"text":"Mastro's is the best of times and the worst of times:  The Best:  Food - Probably the best steak I have ever had, cooked to perfection, and somehow is different than every other Bone-In Filet.  Gratin potatoes were great too.  Portion size on appetizers is a bit much for two people, not complaining, it just seems odd to have so much left over when it comes to a starter salad, etc.  Service - Waiter was terrific, super informed, over  all friendly, not pushy and did not rush us at all, especially considering the restaurant was packed.  The Worst:  Hostess - Nothing kills the first vibe of a restaurant more than a 19 year old big timing the customers.  No one needs to be saluted entering the restaurant, but being dismissive is unacceptable for a restaurant as good and high priced as City Hall.  The Music - In one weekend I experienced two Mastro restaurants (ocean club being the other) and I can't figure out what the live music is all about.  Both restaurants are decorated super classy, but then the live music is WAY TOO LOUD and completely detracts from the experience.  City Hall has the loud music in the lounge area, so if you are seated in that area, prepare to scream at the people you dine with.  To make matters worse, the restaurant pipes this live music in to the main dining room.  Be prepared to spend $200 on a steak dinner while listening to Huey Lewis Karaoke type performances.  PLEASE STOP THE MUSIC !!    One last word of advice.  Call for your reservations !!  If you book online, the restaurant automatically seats you in the \"lounge\", if you do not know better you will end up next to the keyboard."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place scored as high as I'm giving it is because of the service of a couple of the ladies there. The food was not what I had come to expect out of this place. I've eaten here probably two or three other times and was satisfied but this was not one of those times. I was by myself waiting for someone to get done with their conference in the back so I sat alone. My server treated me as if I were there with a party of ten and gave me plenty of attention. I had a martini which was excellent seeing it was huge with the shaker on the side. I had an appetizer and the steak with the bread pudding and I'd give it 3 of 5 stars. Pricey? Sure but it's what I expected coming here and I'd come back but these folks need to step it up in the kitchen if they want to compete because there's plenty of competition around."}
{"text":"Wow. We had a party of 13 in a private room. They'd asked questions about our group when we made the reservation and apparently the server went and googled us because he knew who we were - it was impressive and a tad creepy! Ha! But anyway, the food was the best I've had in a long time and the service impeccable. Steaks were cooked perfectly, sides were great, loved the wasabi Caesar salad and French onion soup - also, save room for butter cake! Thank goodness we had a private room though because when we left, walking through the restaurant, it was incredibly loud."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place when we have business folks in from out of town. Most our guests are from back East and they say they know a thing or two about steak until they come here. Now we have one client that won't go anywhere else (not even the other Mastro affiliates like Ocean Club).  I'm not disappointed either - this is by far the best of the best.   The atmosphere is tasteful, subdued and classy - although a bit dark in the main area - sometimes too dark to see your menu - we all got our glasses on and one guy even pulled out a mini flash light on his key chain. But - if you've been here enough times (guilty) then you don't need the menu - you know what you want and it's always the bone in Kansas City for me. Bone in makes all the difference - I tried the sirloin and while still amazing, just can't beat the sizzle of the bone in.   The seafood tower is a testament to overindulgence and splurge - you pick what you want on there from shrimp to oysters, crab claws, etc. and it comes out on 1-3 iced trays all stacked and ready to devour. The wine list is top notch with the classics as well as new ones to try and don't forget to order some port after dinner!   The sides are amazing as well, the crab gnocchi is deceiving - for our table of 5 they brought out a tiny skillet of this side and we thought we were being cheated - oh was I wrong - you put a small spoonful on your plate and it is so dense and rich that you swear it expanded to 4 times its size when it hit your gut. The lobster mashed potatoes are to die for and even the veggies have some sort of magical power that make you go mmmmm....spinach!  For desert you cannot beat the butter cake - hey - you're splurging so go for broke! It is warm, with a bit of crunch outside and velvet inside. The key lime pie is also a hit and a perfect way to cool off after such a heavy meal.   The service - well I've never seen its equal. There when you need them and never overbearing. Drinks are always full, plates are taken when the moment they need to be, crumbs wiped and napkin folded when you return from the restroom. Then you get to take your leftovers home (there will be plenty) and enjoy it all over again in your sweats the next day."}
{"text":"Was looking for a great steak dinner with all the fixings and I found it.  Would have given 5 stars but the plate my steak came out on was so HOT I burned my finger..left a mark. So unnecessary!!!"}
{"text":"We have heard people rave about City Hall and initially had no clue whether it was a true city hall or something else. Well, we found out that it's a Mastro's and we are huge steak lovers so we came here on a Sunday night.   Beautiful interior with Chihuly glass sculptures, red ambient lightly and overall classy feel. There was a talented trio playing piano, guitar and singing live covers of contemporary music. We found out that there are about 13 Mastros and it's actually owned by Billionaire Dollar Buyer, Tilman Fertitta.   We started off with an excellent 4 bread selection, I loved their warm pretzel bread the most. Our servers were the best and extremely attentive and friendly. The bone-in filet was cooked perfectly to our taste. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must and the sautéed asparagus was a great addition to the steak. We topped the night off with their famous signature warm butter cake. It was absolutely decadent and the large scoop of ice cream and whipped cream hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"Great patio for dinner. A hidden gem of maestro's."}
{"text":"Mastro's absolutely kills it. Insanely expensive for a regular guy like me, but worth every penny. Celebrated our anniversary with my wife and she loved it too. She got a lemon drop and they use some dry ice concoction so it steams and bubbles for awhile which was really cool. The steaks (filet and ny) were both on point. The shrimp cocktail was unreal. So freakin big and fresh. The butter cake was the best dessert I've ever eaten in my life. See y'all next year!"}
{"text":"We decided to sit in the main dining room since the last time we sat in the bar area (by the piano), we felt we didn't get the kind of attention that Mastro's usually offers.   We were given a table next to the glass that separates the dining room from the bar.  After about literally 30 seconds,  I could smell garbage/sewage.  Within the line of vision, we could see an open door and  inside a garbage can --so we assumed it was garbage smell.  We told our waitress who said she could change our table and she did.  We were told that it was not garbage --it was coming from  below( sewer).  My thoughts were that if they know the cause, why wasn't Mastro's more proactive in stifling the smell.  After being seated as far away from that table as possible, we noticed that a male manager was assessing the situation.  Five minutes later, a large, sizzling plate of garlic was paraded by a waiter all along the offensive area.  How clever!  Using garlic to mask the sewer smell.  Smart, smart, smart. And now for the good part of this review.....  Smoked Salmon Appetizer:  Excellent  (Good salmon with capers, onions, cucumbers and toast points) Bloody Mary:  Excellent Bread:  Just OK.  It wasn't the kind of bread you find in Paris where it is so delicious you gladly give up the main dish just to continue eating bread.  I don't know what it is about Parisian bread.... Must be the water. Warm Spinach Salad:  Just OK.  Bacon was overdone so it was bits of hardness.  Lardons are supposed to be rendered but left with enough fattiness that you can still taste the bacon as bacon and not a bacon hardness.  As much as I tried, it was not good enough to even eat half way. Veal Chop:  Cooked exactly as was requested.  Expertly done. Asparagus:  Nicely done with garlic and a touch of horseradish... Chocolate Sin cake:  Nothing could be better... with whipped cream.  Double YUM.   Thanks to our waitress who was right on point with service."}
{"text":"Good morning my Az peeps! FYI... This five star beauty was a treat last night. Great atmosphere , great tasting food , and may I say the staff is 100%on their game ! I mean they are on top of it!  Mastro's City Hall Scottsdale I gave five star because this place accommodates many people and the occasions that follow . It's huge inside so if you want a private evening together it's available . So grab your sexy man , your pretty lady and good friends and try it out for yourself . Wait... Before I sign off ,for the four of us after splitting the bill ,we spent 250 a piece that's with my man downing four drinks .  Don't forget dessert \"Mastro's  signature warm butter cake\" so delicious and mouth watering it was worth the calories !!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place feels like a strip club ... that serves top class steaks.   A few of us stumbled in decked out in desert attire from a work event --- we still proudly sat in the main dining room knowing we were going to fire up expense account coinage.  It's a dimly yet pink-ly lit joint...someone really has to make the place feel warmer or nicer. There's also a bathroom attendant --- again, screams clubby.  The food itself is incredible. Had a 33oz chefs choice ribeye (massive, finer marbling). We also got the lobster mashed potatoes (unique and awesome). And to top it off the butter cake is a calorie bomb that is worth every bite. Don't share.  At the end of the day, this is a great steakhouse. Awesome food and service, and prices are what you'd expect for quality. It's just gives off a really really weird vibe that makes me feel like I'm going to get a lap dance post dinner."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had. Period. We had a party of 4, and were greeted immediately by our waiter Drew. He was awesome. There was never a time that we felt ignored, nor were we feeling rushed. And this was a Saturday night. Drew really knew his job, the menu, and the specials for the night which were plenty. This was my first time here, but the other couple had eaten there a few times, and helped pick the items that were the best. We decided to do many appetizers and sides and then the wife and I decided to split the porterhouse steak. We had the marrow, crab claws, gnocchi, macn cheese. The service was outstanding as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Only thing that was a dagger was the waiter. Always trying to sell something else on the menu. If I want a glass of wine, I'm well aware that I can order one, I don't need anyone to ask me twice, or, even once for that matter. I also have a menu in front of me. If I want more food,  I will order it. After I ordered my entree, he tried to trick me into asking me what side I wanted with it. I'm smarter than that, please don't keep trying to up charge so that your tip is larger by default of subtotal. This actually made me tip him less and I do this along with everyone else who tries to pressure people into buying something. I would have tipped more had he not done this. The staff needs to be retrained to waiters/waitresses instead of used car sales men. It takes away from the elegance of the ambiance. I'm at a steakhouse, let the product(s) sell itself if you're confident in your quality. I don't think I ever want to come back again, the food is great, however, there are many other great steakhouses in AZ."}
{"text":"I started a tradition that every year for my bf's birthday we celebrate by hitting up a swanky steak house. Last year we hit up Del Frisco's in NYC, and while Mastro's cannot even come close to any NYC Steakhouse, it's definitely the best I've tasted in AZ so far... as it should be for a place with a pricey menu.   My boyfriend ordered the 8oz Petite Fillet (that was far from petite if you ask me), and I ordered the 12oz Farm Raised Salmon (absolutely the biggest piece of fish ever placed in front of me). Needless to say, the portions here are large. My salmon was cooked to perfection. Flakey, a little rare and oh so yummy. The bf devoured his fillet, he thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Then for our sides we got the steamed broccoli & asparagus as well as the creamed spinach. All 3 sides I would recommend. Fresh veggies and hats off to the chef for the creamed spinach, all of it was fabulous.   I must take a moment to also highlight their Mojito. Being the Mojito feen that I am, this one was just awesome... and SO strong! I downed one and could already feel it.   They also brought out some of their buttercake for my bf's birthday on the house. It was superb, and I could tell it probably had 5+ sticks of butter in it because it was so richly decadent. I definitely recommend this desert, WOW!   As far as atmosphere goes, I like what Mastro's has done with their interior decor. Not stuffy at all, and it has an elegant steakhouse vibe. Our server wasn't over bearing and gave us just enough service to where we felt as though our every need was catered too. Great customer service in my book.  While I'm don't think I'll be back for dinner anytime soon (my wallet won't allow it), I must say that I might venture back for drinks in the very near future. That Mojito was tasty... I'm still thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"One of my coworkers was nice enough to treat us to a dinner at Mastro's, and it definitely did not disappoint. The service was impeccable. My filet was cooked to perfection, and the lobster mac and cheese (off the menu, just ask for it) was absolutely amazing. There was live music in the lounge and the singer was definitely talented, though the music was a touch too loud throughout the restaurant for regular conversation.   The only part of the evening that didn't live up to my expectations were the drinks. I ordered a bourbon old fashioned, and it was way sweeter than I anticipated. It was also served with chip ice versus large cubes, and a regular maraschino cherry. I might be a bit of a cocktail snob, but I really expected a solid old fashioned at a steakhouse of Mastro's caliber.   The butter cake! Do NOT skip the butter cake! I have dreams of it."}
{"text":"We were there for our companies dinner & the let me tell you I am not a meat lover but I had fillet minon & it was mouthwatering amazing! The ambiance in the red was very beautiful & the cheesecake was extremely good!!! The service was with outermost respect & all the waiters were very polite!!! Just an amazing experience overall!!!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write.  I have always enjoyed this place and usually take clients there a few times a year.  Last night I took my wife and 4 other guests and it was not the usual great experience.  My bone in ribeye frankly wasn't all that great.  It had very little flavor, but that wasn't the biggest issue.  Our table of 6 was seated right next to another table of 6 and other than the people right next to you, you couldn't hear the other 3 people at the table.  The music was loud, which didn't help either.  Having just been at Del Frisco's twice in Vegas the difference between the two places was striking.  All in all I believe everyone had a nice time, but for the money spent, and as the one paying the bill it was not worth it.   Unfortunately I will be looking for a different steak house for our next client dinner."}
{"text":"It's almost ridiculous just how amazing this place is!  My boyfriend took me here on a whim while visiting Scottsdale...and it changed my life!  We sat at the bar and ordered the lemon drop. First, it's HUGE and is actually enough for two.  They put dry ice in it simply for affect, but the flavor is outstanding--we ordered one each. :)  We then ordered the 12oz filet and the wedge salad.  The portions here are sizeable so we split the meal and it was perfect.  The filet was UNREAL...it was tender and had AMAZING flavor.  We also got a side of their horseradish cream...REDUNK!! VERY spicy and VERY GOOD!  I prefer my filet a little on the medium-well side but we ordered it medium which was perfect for my  boyfriend.  Since we split the meal, the waiter brought me my own scorching hot plate...hot enough to sizzle my filet to perfection!  The waitstaff and bartenders were attentive and informative.  It seems like the staff enjoy working here.  The overall vibe of City Hall is classy, sexy, and although a bit pricey...WELL WORTH EVERY $$!!  This place is a definite MUST every time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, Mastro's. It was my first time dining here (for a birthday celebration)  and it was amazing. The staff were excellent and put up with all of our shenanigans; after a day at the Oktoberfest festival, there were plenty of shenanigans to be had.  I decided to start off with some oysters, which were quite fresh and hit the spot. But for the main course, I decided to take it to the turf and ordered the 12oz Bone in Filet. Un-fu@#ing-believable. So tender and juicy, this filet just melts in your mouth. As side dishes we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and gorgonzola mac & cheese. I was expecting the potatoes to have a few chunks of lobster here and there, but in fact there was a ton of lobster. I even found an entirely intact piece of lobster claw-meat! And the mac & cheese was equally delicious.  I highly recommend Mastro's if you are in the mood for a great steak (not to say their seafood isn't just as tasty). The ambiance is a little stuffy, but the staff did an excellent job of making everyone feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Not worth it. I went to Masto's for the first time this weekend. I brought my fiancé and future in-laws. We arrived a little early and got a drink at the bar/lounge. The drinks were great and the lounge had an energetic atmosphere, which we liked. Our table was promptly ready and we were seated at our reserved time in the dining room. The entire dining room seamed to be rolling their eyes as we were being seated next to a table of 8, boasting one very loud and belligerent neanderthal. I hate to admit it, but the behavior of this one person ruined our experience and that of the other patrons around us. We could hardly hear each other at our own table to make conversation. Perhaps the most aggravating thing, was the fact that the staff failed to address the issue after our table and other tables made them aware of the disruptive idiot. We didn't get so much as an apology. They remained willfully oblivious to this behavior as if we were at an Outback or Sizzlers, even as the idiot attempted to physically assault another patron who kindly asked him to keep it down. It was ridiculous! Mastro's even posted a staff member in a white coat to stand guard near the table in case any further altercation erupted. All the while, this behavior was permitted and seemingly authorized by Mastro's staff who failed to make any effort to enhance the experience of the other patrons having to endure the antics of this drunk buffoon. I had, what I would consider to be a reasonable expectation of service and ambiance at a steakhouse like Mastro's, which turned out to be woefully unmet. They did a great job cleaning the peanut shells off the floor, I will give them that."}
{"text":"I have dined at this restaurant twice, spaced 8 years apart and had a tremendous experience both times! The meal and service were amazing. We went on a Sunday night and we were seated promptly. The bone in ribeye was as good as I've ever had and the caesar salad and sides were well above average. We had a change of servers after our drinks were served, but other than that everything was perfect, including the nice touch of live music within our view. The butter cake with ice cream topped off a great meal. I would highly recommend this place, and suggest that you make reservations well in advance! Or you can go early like I did on a busy night and get a great meal in before the crowd arrives."}
{"text":"Mastro's is amazing! One of our servers tonight went out of his way to make sure we were absolutely satisfied with our experience. So thank you Andrew for your exceptional service and down to earth attitude!"}
{"text":"Very very good Chop house. Great wine list - loud fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing service and outstanding food. Mastro's truly is an unparalleled dining experience. The steaks are phenomenal and the side dishes are delicious. The butter cake is a must have for dessert."}
{"text":"One of my relatives was indebted to me and decided to let me pick my payback. City Hall  was my love's choice, so I went with it and man am I glad I did. My waiter was Alan and he was worth the $100+ tip he received from our party of four. City Hall is an experience, not just a restaurant. The food is absolutely fabulous. By looking at the website, you would think this place has a great atmosphere, but it does-the website doesn't do it justice. One tip; go around 5 pm if you want a more intimate experience. Otherwise it gets very loud and is a scene for those who want to be seen. Best dinner I've ever had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Truly delicious food. They do their best to accommodate you in usually a very busy restaurant. The atmosphere is the sea and to be seeing kind of place young beautiful people really fun and you can't even sit at the bar and watch sports."}
{"text":"5/2013 Update:  We returned to this wonderful restaurant, and it was even better than the first time we went.  Service, Food, and Drinks were all outstanding.  The management team here is amazing.  Original Review: My girlfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day here yesterday. It was terrific.  The food was amazing.  Huge portions so we had an amazing lunch today. The cocktails were amazing.   Service by Bobby was amazing.  They even gave us a rose at the end of the night!  The only things that could use improving:  -Service at the host stand was slow.  Granted they were very busy and their computers crashed, but we arrived for our 6:30 PM reservation and were seated at 6:50 PM. -I understand wanting to list off specials, but the amount of things that Bobby had to tell us before we could order was ridiculous.  Way too much. -Oddly long wait times for a few things:  pretzel bread (which was awesome), the dessert, and the to-go boxes.  We actually waited so long for them to box up our leftovers we started to get concerned they accidentally threw it away.  Definitely a great spot for a very special occasion."}
{"text":"We had drinks and dessert there. The butter cake was phenomenal. The service was better than the cake! I felt like our server, Kerel, was part of our family. He knew what I wanted before I knew what I wanted!"}
{"text":"If you don't have a lot of money for an amazing super romantic all-out steak dinner, at least call them for some lobster mashed potatoes to go...I PROMISE it will be the best $23 on mashed potatoes EVER!  Tucked away in what looks like a business strip across from Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, City Hall doesn't look like a steakhouse and the entrance can be hard to find (keep going down Camelback West and turn in across from Neiman).  You walk into a cozy, upscale venue that doesn't demand you be dressed to the nines.  It's equally a great place for the date of a lifetime or an upscale hangout with friends (there is a loungy area by the bar with live music).  This is the place where waiters replace dropped forks before you've reached to grab it, where they are talkative but make the best recommendations ever, and where you will stop talking because the food is just too good to slow down for conversation.  The steak speaks for itself--just order it.  I still have other favorites in the valley, but their steak is definitely in the top tier of quality.    It is the sides that totally make this place. I never thought I would like creamed corn--this place makes it southern style and I basically ended up stealing it from my husband. LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES.  These changed my world.  Seriously.  I can't even make this.  It was creamy and meaty and flavorful and enough to eat for lunch for the next two days!  I took this to go and thanked the Mastro's staff while I reheated it the next day.    This place isn't cheap, mind you.  It'll set  you back just like any high end steakhouse dinner.  So make sure you are hungry and you are ready to appreciate it.  Anytime husband wants to meet me after I'm done shopping, this is my go to place.  I absolutely love it. So much food we took enough home to feed us both for lunch the next day and part of dinner! They also separated all the components for me so that everything could be reheated separately."}
{"text":"This is a FANTASTIC steak house. I'm originally from Dallas so I'm really into the whole steakhouse thing. I've been let down a few times since moving to Scottsdale, but now that I have found City Hall I will definately be back for more.   The food is just amazing in every way...crab cakes yum. Filet Mignon Yum...all of it was first class from the service at the bar to the service at the table.   Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now, and I owe a review.  I am from Kansas City, so I am used to fantastic steak, and I am selective.  Maestro's does not disappoint!  The atmosphere is upscale but rather loud due to the live music and the massive size of the place.  They really pack people in here!!    I usually order the petit filet(8 ounce),  medium rare, and it is perfect every time. A word of warning. . . Unless you have a massive appetite, go easy on the sides!  Bread service is fabulous with my favorite, the pretzel bread, and sides are in family-size portions.  Unless you like taking food home (I don't when on vacation), plan on an entree and splitting a side with someone.  Oh, and another word of warning, the plate comes out sizzling, and it pops and sizzles a little to surrounding surfaces, so I wouldn't wear silk or anything not dark.    Service is spectacular, with knowledgeable and attentive servers.  They truly value the happiness of their customers.  A definite must-try if you like steak."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Perfect for a special event. And come hungry. Great service, great food and generous portions. Best steakhouse in Phoenix, for sure. Steak melts in your mouth and is perfectly prepared. Employees love their jobs and like making your night!"}
{"text":"Best high end steak house in town, in my opinion...! Service and food is always excellent... we've rented out rooms for various business functions... and I am never let down. It's definitely spendy... but the value is definitely there.  Highly recommended if you're planning a date night or want to impress a client... !"}
{"text":"the food is sooo good, isn't it? i said the food is good! yeah, i know - it's very loud in here. but the food is great! that lobster bisque was delicious. the lobster bisque!! yeah! delicious! it's so loud though. and the steak. no, no... the steak. right. so good. and the service is great, too. what's that? dammit it's loud in here. i can barely hear the people sitting two feet from me. for the amount of money we're spending you'd think they'd have a more elegant and relaxing environment. pretty cool place though. i said, pretty cool place. doubt i'll be back, though - it's just so loud!  [edit: This review was originally typed in all caps to make it clear that you'll have to yell at your dinner guests in order to be heard. However, I guess Yelp filters those out. Suffice it to say, it's damned loud in this place, which will prevent me from going back, and would've prevented me from going in the first place, so I believe it's important.]"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for weds the 29th at 8pm for my girlfriends birthday, we were early and checked in and we had to wait till 8:30 to be sat. It took us going to the host stand 4 times before they sat us, the service was horrible. After complaining enough a manager came and sat us, he said nothing about the wait or even apologized. The service was bad, I've been here before and the service was perfect. This time it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks and 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  I told them it was a birthday and the server had no clue. It wasn't until we told the server that we had a bday that he acknowledged it. Very disappointing for $300 meal for 4 people, I will be taking my money elsewhere next time, food was up to par but they just set the sides down and walked away, no pre bussing was done until we put our napkins on our plates and stacked them up. This was a bad experience for such a high quality restaurant, I won't return sadly. I suggest orange sky or another spot for special occasions. The manager still never revisited the table to see how things were and the server never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. Sad experience for a birthday that was supposed to be special."}
{"text":"Bone in fillet and all 18 of those ounces of that juicy cow made my evening at Mastro's.  It came in two separate medium cooked pieces (pink on the inside and perfectly prepared) and the bone there were probably a good 15-16 oz of meat.  If you're going to enjoy a $45-$50 steak, this is the way to go.  We paired the steaks with a 2007 Baileyana Grand Firepeak Cuvee, Edna Valley which went down really well and had an excellent flavor.  Two appetizers also were ordered: sauteed asparagus & lobster gnocchi.    Nothing too special about the sauteed asparagus but it was really fresh and well seasoned.  I guess the only way you can mess up asparagus is if you overcook it and that certainly wasn't the case.  Another highlight of the night, almost as special as the bone in fillet, was the lobster gnocchi.  It may give me a heart attack earlier in life but it was that darn good.  The small stringy pieces of lobster was a nice addition to a doughy gnocchi entree.  But this gnocchi restored my faith in the dish because all other gnocchi's I've had have been \"bland\" and very doughy.  It's hard to explain what made this one sooo great but it had a crusty flaky breadcrumb type top to it along with great flavor.  Mastro's...you lived up to the expectations and then some, and you better have because it was $260 for the two of us!!!   If it was anything less than stellar, you would gotten ONLY 4 stars on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"We had the bone in ribeye, rack of lamb, heirloom tomato and burrata salad and the wedge salad. The proteins were perfectly cooked with salads beings a nice way to start the meal. We chose the garlic mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts as sides for the main meal. It all was excellent and exceeded my expectations. After disappointing visits to similar level restaurants in Vegas, Miami and DC we finally struck gold in Scottsdale right in our back yard. The service was prompt personable and professional.  Thank you for the awesome evening."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  Overall bad quality in regards food products. Appetizers: fried calamari was so bad, we didn't even finish it. Sautéed sea scallop: the quality of the scallop was chewy. Soup: lobster bisque was sooooo bad, it was thicker than its suppose to be. Steak: bone in rib eye, the steak was probably picked up from Walmart kinda quality, the fat around the steak was chewy not melty. Drinks: the coke came in a small tiny bottle, the bottle was warm, and the servant brought a cup full of ice and poured the coke inside. Now the ice is melted and the coke has no bubbles. We asked to bring a bucket full of ice and get us new coke bottles. They ended up doing that with new bottles that he opened up previously. We had to ask again to bring new bottles without opening them and put them In ice so we can have the taste of real COLD coke. The coke was $4 each. Such a pathetic restaurant.  If I'm paying that amount of money, I better get bad ass quality. I would recommend buying your own steak from whole food and cook it"}
{"text":"Mastro's has a menu that makes choosing anything extremely difficult. I thought I knew what I wanted, until our server came with recommendations/specials and put me back at square one.  I can't say I enjoyed the bone marrow as much as my brother did, but I did enjoy the arugula side salad (he did not- he's not one to eat vegetables. Ever.).   $35 for lobster mashed potatoes sounds like a bad financial investment. I don't even like mashed potatoes, but DON'T SKIP THIS. Albeit a little on the salty side, it was quite delicious. A pound of lobster on top of creamy mashed potatoes... who knew I'd enjoy this starch so much.  My eyes got even bigger when my brother's bone-in rib-eye was brought to the table. Of course, the ever-so-thoughtful sibling of mine had asked for the order to be split (I think he knew I was going to get into his plate whether he liked it or not). Extremely juicy, well-seasoned steak with a beautiful char. As I put a piece into my mouth followed by a spoonful of mashed potatoes and lobster, I suddenly knew what heaven felt like.  Service was great- server was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful. I just wish I had some self control but I can never resist the bread basket, so we couldn't order more food. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Impeccable service accompanies a perfect dinner in fine ambiance. The steak was perfect and served hot!! Delicious is an understatement!"}
{"text":"It's supposed to be an amazing place, but we didn't get helped at the bar. We were ready to pay and enjoy the food, but I have a hard time enjoying myself at a steakhouse when I'm not paid attention to. They didn't even come to ask us how we're doing until they needed us to move  over a seat. Horrible and rude service! then after all that, they ended up not needing the seats after all. We were so looking forward to a wonderful girls night out and a delicious dinner. I guess we will go to another Steak House where we will get the attention we deserve. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This food was amazing! We had the seafood tower and it was absolutely delicious. Sides are big enough to share and the steaks are amazing. People say to order bone in for more flavor but even their steaks without bone were very flavorful! We were stuffed by dessert time but our waitress convinced us to get some choc covered strawberries wrapped up for later. They were so good I ate them as soon as we were home! Very crowded inside on a busy weekend, it would be nice to try to sit outside."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on Cinco de Mayo.  Ordered the ceasar salad 4+/5  Filet Mignon 4/5  Tried the mushrooms 4/5  Service 5/5  The place is nice, a bit on the darker side (not unlike many steakhouses) however, I would rather eat at Ocean Mastro in Kierland - which feels like its essentially the same food) but with a much livelier vibe and setting.  The duo playing the piano and guitar was OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"What's to say that hasn't already been said of this iconic classy establishment?   I've dined in dining area and in bar area.  Top notch service and amazing food.   For this review I'll stick to bar area.    The bartenders-Classy, personable and knowledgeable about the drinks and wine they serve.  The pours are strong and well justified in the price.   The scene-Definitely ideal for people watching.  Always look your best here. If you are self conscious, go sit in dining area.   The ambiance-They usually have a piano player and singer or DJ and singer to keep the beat lively.  Usually covering latest songs and classics.  The bar is lit, but semi dark.  Just right setting in my opinion.    Overall if you are in agreement with my assessment above of a place in Scottsdale you'd like to see and be seen, have amazing food and drinks, and dress up, this is your place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 6 stars. Absolutely amazing experience. Exceptional service, drinks. Best steak I've ever had (bone-in filet). The only thing that compares is when I had a steak from Mastros several years ago!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was top-of-the-line. The service was excellent, and the ambience was perfect. The decorations are interesting. It is a must that you order the warm butter cake."}
{"text":"Went with friends.  Inside was very nice.  Not too loud.  Only complaint I had on the ambiance was the lighting.  I had to use my cell phone flash light app to read the menu.  We had 2 waiters.  Very knowledgeable on the steaks.  One was a bit pushy but not too bad.  Our party of 10 had mostly steaks.  My family really liked their steaks.  All were cooked as ordered and were tasty (I sampled my wife's steak) . I ordered the pork chop.  Very tasty but slightly overcooked.  A few had some starter salads.  Nothing fancy there and not worth the cost (IMO).  We also sampled many of the side dishes.  The lobster mashed potatoes were very good as were the scalloped potatoes.  The green beans could have had more slivered almonds.  The asparagus were the least liked side dish.  Not much flavor.  Most of us had water to drink.  A few of the kids had soda.  They serve the soda in small bottles so each refill ups the $$. Seems a bit tacky that they nickel and dime people on soda.  We sampled 2 of the deserts.  One was a sugar cake.  I really liked it.  The other was a huge piece of chocolate cake.  We all agreed that the chocolate cake was too dry.  Coffee was good.  Nice espresso cup.  All in all, it was a pleasant evening spent with good friends."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the assorted breads that were brought out at the beginning and we also raved about the oysters we had for appetizer. Delicious! Thanks yelpers for that appetizer tip!  I had the petite filet and it was pretty bland. I've had much, much better. My husband had the fish that was a special and highly recommended by the waiter. The presentation was terrible and it just tasted ok. We had mac & cheese and mushrooms for sides and they were good.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and a big bar area that was fun to wait at and have a drink before our table was ready. The waiter/service was ok, but nothing like you would expect at a nice steak restaurant.   One other thing, I can't stand having someone in the restroom \"assisting you\" with the soap and towels and feeling obligated to tip. I think it is cheesy and irrating.  I probably would not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best steak I've every had. The lobster mash is amazing, very upscale atmosphere. Great drinks, the side-car was very intersting."}
{"text":"City Hall is what I call my 'last meal' - I always eat here before I leave out of the country. It's also a great place to celebrate! Specifically, I come here for THE BEST SHRIMP COCKTAIL I've ever had in my entire life. The shrimp are gigantic and the raw horseradish served with it - allows me to make my cocktail sauce sooo HOT! It's the best horseradish I've ever had, hands down.  It's great to have bartenders who know how to serve up their cocktails and wine. The red wine is served at it's proper temperature (THANK YOU!) and there is no hesitation when you ask for a classic cocktail like a French 75. Not to mention, they are perfectly balanced. Kudos to knowing your wine & spirits in additional to great food!  We'll usually split some dishes, the filet sliced, chopped salad and maybe some creamed spinach and you're set. From service to ambiance, City Hall has everything covered!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST STEAKHOUSE -- I am in love. Everything is AMAZING. We started off with the ahi tuna tartare and it was delicious! I absolutely enjoyed every bite. And the bone-in fillet is a MUST. There is nothing quite like it. The marrow juice glazes the cut giving it a unique flavorful juice. Next was the lobster mashed potato and that was HUGE - mixed with butter and garlic with real chunks of lobster. We had sauteed mushrooms for sides. The amount of food for two people was overwhelming. AND for someone, like myself, who does not like to take leftovers back -- we attempted to devour everything and still managed to save enough room for the chocolate raspberry cake. Thick dark chocolate cake topped with chocolate syrup and a couple strawberries. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and his dad and stepmom...and we were all impressed. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, and the sides were to die for. We had Brussels sprouts (who knew there was an \"s\" at the end of Brussels when talking about the veggies!?), the loaded baked potato and the mac and cheese. I wish I hadn't been so full from the steak, which made me unable to finish off the mac and cheese or really dig into any of the potato, but what we tried was fantastic. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"You forget that there is still this level of service and quality of food until you experience again.  Had dinner here tonite with family.  from beginning to end the service and the food was outstanding.  I had the chopped salad, salmon and the table shared asparagus, lobster and mash potatoes and mac and cheese.  Everything was outstanding--although we didn't, the salads are plenty enough to share.  my salmon was flavorful and cooked to perfection--the mash potatoes and lobster and mac and cheese however were sublime.  Our server was fabulous--timed everything perfectly.    From now on--I am going to remember how this level of service and quality of food makes for a great evening."}
{"text":"Best steak house in the valley!  The decor and atmosphere are enjoyable.  The staff is always top notch.  I only go here on special occasions because it is a bit pricey but the experience and amazing food is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Beyond reality. One of the best ever Restaurants I've ever been to. You can't possibly go wrong here. The highest rating I will ever give."}
{"text":"We travel quite a bit throughout the US and we both agree this is the BEST steakhouse we have ever enjoyed.  Seriously, they serve the best STEAK, the best gorgonzola mac and cheese, the best spicy caesar salad and the list goes on.  Amazing wine list and service.  Not a budget friendly place by any means but worth every penny if you can afford it.  We cannot recommend this place highly enough for entertaining customers or celebrating a special occasion.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I have eaten steak on 4 continents - the filet (bone-in or not) is the best in the world. This place is not cheap, especially if you add a glass of vino, BUT, for special occasions, impress a date, seal a deal or to enjoy the best steak in north america, this is the place to go. Ask for Alan as your waiter. You will not be dissapointed.  The sides are amazing - creamed corn (light on the cream), the gorgonzola mac-n-cheese and their house pinot (or reisling if its summer) won't let you down."}
{"text":"Billy, our server, was exceptional. we were sat immediately in the patio, and I could tell it was very busy, with numerous tables, watching him take care of all of his guests with little to no stress (I'm in the industry so I notice little things like that) all the while being able to give us all the attention and care that we needed/expected. The person that dropped our food off (jake? I think) was charming and very knowledgeable about our seafood tower, and our dinner. which was by the way, delicious and was everything we came to expect from such a high end restaurant. From the hostess, to the busser, server, and even the manager visiting our table-- everything was on point. thank you again for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"I like this place much better than Ruth Chris's, Flemings, or Mortons. Cool dining room, great steaks, and creamed spinach- my favorite! Good location, excellent service, been here about 5 times and its been a while, so I need to get back here! Nice place to take out of towners because its not a chain and its very, very good!"}
{"text":"A 1 might seem harsh. However, my grade is soley based on management (in)ability to solve problems. Have a better problem solving method in this company. Most unsatisfied customers problems could be solved if management had a better plan. For whatever reason I am only trying to help their sustainability. I love my city and its business partners.  We went to Mastro's for Mothers  day 6pm dinner my wife, 2 adult sons and I. 2 of us have been here before but it has been a few years. We try and eat at as many new restaurants as we can when we dine so we eat out once or twice a week. We all have been to most of the fine steak houses in phoenix metro. Since 2 of us had not been here before we decided to give Mastro's a try.  We were about 15 minutes early so we went to the bar and have 1 drink each..$60 plus tip..somewhat expected.  When we were seated the restaurant was about 1/2 full which was surprising for mothers day. The waiter and his help were not unfriendly but were not overly friendly and less than attentive as you would expect in a fine steak house. We had to keep asking for attention for what I find normal in a fine restaurant. The waiter did not circle back after our meals were delivered and ask if our meals were satisfactory. I usually order my steak rare plus as I know I will at least get my preferred medium rare. One of my son's ordered his medium rare and it came out definitely medium to medium well. He did not want to make a big deal about it so he just ate it. Never being asked if we were satisfied.  Again, the waiter and his staff were not rude but just acted like they did not want to be there that evening. We had quite a bit of leftover steak and entrees that we asked for a doggy bag for. It never came so we asked again before departing the table about our leftovers. They finally came back with a bag.   After the $400 food cost meal plus tip and $60 bar drinks my wife decided to speak to management so they were aware of our experience. She stated she was not looking for anything in terms of compensation but wanted to let the manager know what kind of service we got. The manager thanked her and we left. The manager also said the waiter was one of the best (I would hate to meet his less qualified).  I get an off day by employees but not when your wage is predicated on 15-20% tips off of $400. I tip on service provided as I believe it is earned not given. I tip from anywhere from 10%-25%.  When we got home the leftover food had only partial of the leftovers...and there again was enough left over food for a couple of meals. Which makes me wonder if they threw out our leftovers and salvaged what they could out of the garbage?   She then called Mastro's back the next morning and spoke to an employee as the manager was not there. The employee said the manager would call back after 2:30pm. That was Monday May 14th and this is Monday May 21st. Still no call or response from the manager. Again, we have dined at Steak 44, Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, Ditkas, Shula's, Donovans, Morton's,  Durants and many others. This was by far the worst effort of any of them. This whole experience clearly falls on management and ownership. I manage a multi million dollar annual retail business here in phoenix. We have a 24 hour rule on responding to customer issues/complaints. To not get a call in 7 days is bad business practices and could hurt long term business sustainability if this is normal response tactics. Again, we are not looking for anything just to help them which they do not seem to need or want.   Reading other disgruntled patrons on yelp it is clear this is not an isolated instance for many of my issues. Too bad, as I remember my first experience years ago as being wonderful.  I will stick to Fleming's Chandler/Ahwatukee as we have never had anything but quality food and superior service..my vote is in!"}
{"text":"So this is probably the most expensive steak house we've been to in the Phoenix area.  Yes the steaks are delicious, seafood fresh and delicious but the entertainment is amazing.  From the music to the women who hang around the bar trying to lure in rich men.  Come early in the evening and get a great a nice view of the bar and watch the live entertainment."}
{"text":"Went to Houston's first and didn't feel like doing a 40-minute wait on a Wednesday night at 7pm for a table.  City Hall had tables available so we thought we would \"settle\" and dine here.  Steaks (three ordered the New York Pepper steak and I ordered the Kansas City) were amazing!  Cooked to perfection and even though I loved mine I think I would opt for the NY Pepper next time.  We ordered a chopped salad, which is enough for four people to share and out of this world.  We also had garlic mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli; both of which were amazing.  Two of us had a red blend (wine) that was recommended by the server and knocked ourselves on the forehead when we got home for not knowing what it was because we loved it.  The reason it doesn't get five stars is the fact that it is a bit pricey ($9 for a side of broccoli is a tad much) and the sound level is slightly distracting.  The women's restroom is an adventure but I was a little put off by being ignored by the attendant but still expected to leave a tip for her when she handed me a thick paper towel while chatting with someone else.  Still, I did enjoy the three bowls of candy (Starburst, Tootsie Rolls, and mints) to choose from.  Oh, and yes, try the pretzel bread :)  My first thought this morning was, \"I think next time I go to City Hall I'll split a chopped salad and a NY Pepper steak with my guest.\"  I rarely, if ever, plan my next trip to a restaurant right after being there, so a big thumbs up goes out to Mastro's City Hall!!"}
{"text":"I looooove steak... actually filet!!  This is hands down the best steak I've had. I grew up eating steaks at some of the best places in England but this topped the the best of them.    My former boss (very rich man) took myself and several co-workers to this place for a company meeting.  He was definitely a regular since he pretty much ordered for us.  Can't remember the name of the Cabernet he ordered but it was f*#king good!!!  We had the shrimp cocktail which was phenomenal made with King Prawns... let's just say massive!!!  You only get three in a glass but well worth it.  He suggested the bone in filet... Hmmm, bones? I am not fond of bones attached to my food but I didn't want to look stupid in front of my boss so I ordered it medium.  He ordered some sides, asparagus, mushroom, potatoes au gratin all very good but let's talk about the steak.... Only served with butter on a 400 degree pewter plate, the knife cut through it like butter and bite after bite it was juicy, tender and amazingly tasty!  Just try it...  FYI-Service was impeccable.  I don't remember dessert but I still have dreams about this steak.  Thanks Paul for introducing me to bones...  I hear there is a location here in LA somewhere so I shall be going very soon... I can't wait!"}
{"text":"This use to be one of our favorite steakhouses but it has gone down hill.  My husband and I went out for dinner for a special occasion. They sat us next to the kitchen. All we could hear were dishes clanking the whole time. We could barely hear each other. The service, which used to be our favorite thing about Maestros, was not even close to what we expected. Our server was young and too casual about everything. Our $54 steak was over cooked and the Brussels were dry, every leaf was black, no tender green goodness in the middle.  Just when you really want the server to ask how everything is, they don't!  It wasn't even worth complaining. The only dish on point was the lobster mash. We won't be back and we certainly won't be recommending Maestros to friends, family, or clients."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for dinner, very good food, excellent service, I'll definitely be back. No complaints."}
{"text":"The crab gnocchi is pure bliss. While, rich, and heavy- it is surreal in how amazingly delicious it is. Coupled with a Porterhouse steak you will be m in heaven with the amazing food you are enjoying. We also had the Mac and cheese and it was delicious but next to the gnocchi it paled- just don't get two carbs at once and the Mac and cheese can hold its own I am certain. Now- don't put your name in for a high top though- they get 4 instead of five stars because they are incapable of seating their high tops like a normal restaurant-let alone one that change $13. For Mac and cheese. The bartender and servers are great- but the front of the house and seating system bite so either reserve a table and sit deep in the bowels of the dark restaurant or sit at the bar- dont rely on them to seat you- unless maybe you are young enough, rich enough - or whatever else they deem hightop worthy."}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in to the minute I left I was impressed.  The only negative thing I have to say is I can't afford to come back every night."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST restaurant I have EVER been to in my LIFE! The place is phenomenal!!   You walk into a very classy atmosphere and everyone is dressed to the 9. We were having a company dinner here, so we were escorted to a lovely private dining room with sliding glass doors to enter and red velvet curtains lining the room.   Who ever had the idea of Lobster Mashed Potatoes... is brilliant! I loved those chunks of lobster in my potatoes, it was probably one of the best side dishes I've ever tried. We also got sides of the Gorgonzola mac and cheese and the sauteed mushrooms, amongst other things, all which were amazing. But the steak, .... it was probably the BEST steak I've had in my life. Perfect cut, perfectly cooked, tender and juicy as ever, truly the best filet I've ever ate.  Order the chocolate covered strawberries as a dessert because those are a must!!!!   The staff - all very pleasant and polite. Sue, who helped coordinate my company dinner there was fabulous to work with. She even worked with my hotel to coordinate car service for us.   Be prepared to empty your pockets, but its worth every last penny."}
{"text":"Warm butter cake! It is the signature dessert of the restaurant that is sweet and fluffy in a round cake that can feed 2 or 3 easily. I really don't have the words to describe it but suffice it to say you need to get it. And do what we did...have your dessert first! That suggestion got the server an extra tip!  As for the rest of the meal, it was heavenly. The steaks and the sides were huge. I had the prime rib and my companion had the ribeye. Both were delicious. There wasn't anything bad about the meal.   We were there two weeks ago and the restaurant was full particularly the bar. The dining room is dimly lit and intimate. For those who are visually challenged in dim light, bring your readers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service! Hannah made the night possible after having a glitch with the reservation and then Brian and Alan took superb care of us! Thanks to them we will be back!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Mastro's but perfection. Since I come from the NYC area it's hard to imagine me saying this is the best steak house I've ever been to, but it is, and it is by far. The instant you walk in the door you know you made the right decision on where to eat. The atmosphere, the food, the friendly attentive staff, and the amazing drinks. So when in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area look no further then Mastro's steak house for the perfect spot."}
{"text":"What a time!  From a delicious Cabernet to a succulent steak, Mastro's crushed it.  I was very impressed with the courteous and service and opulent ambiance.  The spicy Caesar salad was an intriguing start to the meal.  My steak came out perfectly cooked with potatoes that were melt in your mouth delicious.    If you're in Phoenix and want to get a steak, hit up Mastro's...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is an old school experience with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Elvis all sitting in the same restaurant.  They are professional waiters, bartenders and musicians making the experience that much better.  The waiter always recommends something if unsure. The food is always excellent."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and consider this our favorite steak house in Phoenix.  The place has a nice décor and bar area and the food is delicious.  We always enjoy getting the bone in steaks as I think it adds so much more flavor to the meat.  All the steaks are prime and I appreciate that.  As a high end steak house, your sides are ordered separately.  They have complimentary valet parking out front, frankly because it is a pain trying to park your own car.  The service we have had there so far is always on par.  Sometimes the dining room can get a little noisy, so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Very upscale steakhouse!  The service 5 stars.  The scalloped potatoes with fresh jalapenos 5 stars.  The rib eye with bone in 5 stars. I'm taking heaven people! Oh, THE best warm butter cake.  You might die a little but definitely surface back.    Perfection."}
{"text":"Waiter Mike (and all the wait staff) were on point and always helped each other out in serving. Filet I had was awesome, my partner's had gristle. Gnocchi was incredibly decadent. Bread ok but not warm. Ate so much no room for the warm butter cake we wanted to try. Dining room very dated and dark. They should give everyone as a gift penlights to read the menu, or have lights on the table that can be adjusted. Without exception, all diners got out their phones to use the flashlights. That should give them a clue! Room was quiet until the drinks started flowing then people lowered their inhibitions and raised their voices! A millediot sat next to us wearing his baseball cap. This is fine dining not a brew pub! The host should have said something. Not once did anyone in management check on us, but we're all over everyone else."}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall is absolutely the highest quality service, food, and atmosphere in Arizona. I see some reviews on here claiming that this restaurant offers poor service and that is FAR from the truth. During every one of my 5 experiences here, the waiters were excellent, knowledgeable, and very accommodating with any special recommendations a guest might have. This is the type of restaurant where your food & sides come out with 4 different waiters politely serving your plate before setting them down, & even brushing breadcrumbs off of the cloth in front of you. Service is as good as it gets, period. The food is also phenomenal. I have never once been disappointed with anything I have ordered. You absolutely get what you pay for, the quality here is literally impeccable.   If you are a first timer, I recommend any of the Bone-In Steaks (Amazing), or the Sea Bass grilled in their Lemon Caper Butter sauce. For sides I reccommend the Lobster Mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese, Creamed Spinach, or the Sauteed Mushrooms. Their Calamari is also a personal favorite of mine as well.  I have attended many other high end restaurants and have yet to be as satisfied or impressed with any of them as I have with Mastro's."}
{"text":"I would love to give City Hall five stars.  However, it is not \"as good as it gets.\"  In fact, I wouldn't even say \"I'm a fan.\"  So three stars it is, because, yes, it's A-OK.  Why the low rating?  Because when you go to a restaurant like this your standards should be high.  What you should not experience is a steak that is undercooked (ridiculously so.  and this is coming from a guy who will eat rare if it's on his plate.) and a waiter who gets pissy when you mention it.  My sister in law had this happen to her and when we told the server, he used a fork to stab the steak and pick it up to put in on another plate and take it back to recook it.  Ghetto.  The next time we went there we were stuck in some whack back room that must be where they keep the meat during the off-peak because it was freezing.  So I haven't had the best experiences with City Hall.  But, if money is no object, they do generally serve a tasty steak--that is, if they don't screw it up."}
{"text":"I'm with Matthew R. I'd put City Hall up against any Steakhouse in town!  The service is consistent I always feel special. The couple times I have had a problem, management/waitstaff are extremely responsive and accommodating. I frequent CH sometimes upwards of 3x a month, so a problem here or there is nothing.  I will say this for the calorie conscious eater, nothing is low-cal! Ok maybe the steamed asparagus and broccoli. But if you want less butter in your sauteed spinach...or cheese in your cauliflower gratin.... just ask!  Bon Appetite!  Natalie's F*#! the Recession Tips:  Since the portions are so large anyway...split it!! Sometimes I go alone or with a friend after work and sit at the bar.  When I'm not in the mood for a big meal, I just order off the appetizer menu. The Steak Sashimi ($12) is delicious and quite filling actually. This app is soy marinated steak sliced and served over wasabi mashed potatoes. Sometimes I'll add an app-sized salad and I'm gooooood!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional meal here.  excellent service. delicious food.  would try again for sure."}
{"text":"Lovely place to have a nice dinner.  We were here for the Christmas Eve dinner.  The place was packed with people enjoying themselves.    We were seated right away but the waitress did not come over for at least 5 min.  We didn't think it was a big deal but as the night progressed, it got worse...it's understandable though I guess...you know, with tons of customers that night.  We started off with glasses of wine, calamari and french onion soup.  The calamari was very fluff and tasteful with huge portions enough for 2,3 people.  My fiance loved his french onion soup so much that he didn't share enough with me haha.    Then we had the ribeye and filet with sauteed asparagus and Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The ribeye was very tasteful and tender with right amount of fat.  The filet was seasoned very well and also tender.  I must say though that we still prefer Ruth Chris's filet over Mastro's.  The size of the meats were HUGE that we couldn't even finish half of them.    *Location = very nice, right next to Scottsdale Fashion Square *Food = amazing but be ready to bring back half of your dinner with you home. *Service = not so good that night but I think she still did her best. We thought it was interesting how Ruth Chris's waiters in comparison are much  more professional. *Ambiance = very chic but not so romantic"}
{"text":"Mastros is everything I want in a restaurant.  Great service, wonderful atmosphere and awesome food!!!  Everthing was perfect.  Steaks were done as ordered and had a great flavor.  Sides of scalloped potatoes were extra creamy, cream corn was prepared using real cream, and asparagus was perfect.  The butter cake was fantastic.  Take half of your meal home if you have to - this dessert is worth it."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for!!! We celebrated our anniversary at this wonderful place on June 30th. The service was outstanding, extremely knowledgeable server with very helpful suggestions. They had excellent entertainment at their piano bar. While the music was great, I also appreciated the fact that I could hear it AND carry on a conversation with my husband!! We started with drinks that were superb...one drink will take care of you at this place! We both had steaks which were to die for....the best I've ever had. Better than Flemmings, Ruth's Crisp etc. I wish we had shared a steak as we ate until we were nearly sick!!! We saw people leaving with shopping bags of leftovers. We were traveling and didn't have that luxury... Or we would have had a shopping bag too! They even surprised us with a HUGE piece of chocolate cake and divine whipped cream and wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate.....did I mention how stuffed we were??? Yes, it's expensive, but for a special meal....you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall is the definition of 5 Star. The atmosphere, the service, and the food are consistently over the top. There are a few things that are a must order:  1. The Sauteed Shrimp Appetizer.  Out of this world. 2. Steak. Because that's why you are going, right? 3. THE BUTTER CAKE. Might be the best dessert in the city and that is not an exaggeration.  If you are in the Phoenix area and looking for a high end place that will not disappoint, make sure you get to Mastro's"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Scottsdale and Mastro's was our last night out for real food before husband's jaw surgery. We picked Mastro's in hopes of a great steak but got so much more. First, super deep wine list and extremely helpful and knowledgeable sommelier. The food was fantastic and --while not Michelin-star creative-- was clearly super high quality, with great attention to detail. Pretzel rolls flown in from Germany --to die for!-- paired with sweet cream butter, amazing sauteed shrimp, outstanding bone-in filet, and butter cake that is without a doubt the best dessert I've ever eaten in my life. Additionally, our server, Cassie, was professional, extremely competent, and just all-around darling. If you're in the mood for a slightly old-school-ish delight, this is 100 percent the place to go. We will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  This place is not for foodies.  If you are into chilling at a place that serves up presentable food with great service, this place is for you.  However, if you like great tasting food, go elsewhere.  Everything we ordered was subpar in taste.  I asked for a filet medium-rare plus and it came cooked to the right temperature, but was completely devoid of any taste.  The side dishes were also unimpressive and lacked in taste.  My wife ordered the chicken, and that was also not very good.  For the high prices and the poor quality of food, I would have given this place 1 star, but the service was impressive, so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"I went to mastro's scottsdale steakhouse and it was fantastic..the steak was delicious and the lobster was excellent.  we had sweet mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms and they were delicious.  The drinks were great and the service was excellent.  I would suggest only ordering one side because the meal is so big and heavy you don't need all the side dishes.  This is a high end dining experience...if you want great steak in arizona..you must go here!!  we left full and very happy!"}
{"text":"Rating is mostly for the bartender tonight .  Waiting on my small party to arrive ( my mothers 50th bday ) and I decided to sit at the bar and get a glass of Rose'.   My guests arrived and I decided to check out so I could tip the bartender . He hands the check and it was almost $60. I told him that it was not correct and I only had one glass . He look at me very angry and said very loud \" yes you had 3 glasses \" . Very intimidating and he's a very large guy so that didn't quite settle well . He turned fast and showed frustration towards the female bartender and she fixed the check. ( my mother and her boyfriend most definitely witnessed this as well)   Honestly mistakes happen. But do not act like you are a tough bouncer at a strip club wanting to yell at guests because you can. I suggest this bartender work in Vegas and get his jollies that way .. Not here !   Service was kinda slow but the server seemed busy. Usually very happy coming here .  I did talk to the bar manager Mike and he did listen to my concerns . But not sure if I'm sold coming back when there is so many other choices .   I was pretty worked up during dinner but didn't let that spoil my mother's special day ."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in our visit here.  We had a reservation but still had to wait a while in the bar.  15 minutes went by in the bar without being able to get a drink.  I asked a server in the bar area if she could get my wife and I a drink and she said she couldn't because the car tenders would get mad.  The bar tenders seemed more into chatting it up with friends instead of getting customers they didn't recognize drinks.  We talked to a manager and finally got drinks.  The dimmer part wasn't much better.  The waiter was nice but we were never presented with the special selection wine menu. We didn't know one existed until after our visit so we had a bottle of wine off the regular menu that  was suggested by the waiter and it wasn't good.  The steak was good. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes were a disappointment.  I love lobster and love mashed potatoes so I thought this would be great.  They weren't great."}
{"text":"I'm not kidding when I tell you about their bone in filet & their bone in tomahawk steaks!!!! One of THE best steaks in the city hands down! The filet melted in my mouth & they know exactly how to cook them. The place is super busy, but you never feel rushed or like you're not important when dining here. The servers are always a step ahead of you making sure your every need is met & beyond. They serve you like a King & Queen!!! The atmosphere is dark, very dark but they offer you their flashlights to help you read the menu. The server was very knowledgeable about everything, just the way we like it. Try the cheesecake for desert if you want to feel like you've died & gone to Heaven!!!!! Valet was super fast when we wanted to leave & one last thing... There's a wonderful lady in the ladies room who has a little bit of everything for all your women needs! Just the way I like it. If you want the best food, best service, best treatment in al aspects, dine here. Just make sure you make reservations ahead of time so you're guaranteed a table."}
{"text":"I love the dry ice martini. The food and ambiance is always great here. One of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Good steak and wine, sat at the bar for a mandate"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times, courtesy of a supplier with deep pockets.  The food was typical high-end steakhouse.  Not outstanding as expensive steak houses go, but good.  The service is attentive and on-point.  The wine list is voluminous, designed to impress and pricey.  The atmosphere is elegant and definitely impressive.  The downside to a place that is designed to draw a crowd looking to impress others, is that it does.  The restaurant is full of business people impeccably dressed, hoping to wow clients. The bar is full of singles looking to one-up the others and hopefully, end up with new connections, both business and personal.  If you want to dazzle a client, then this is your place. If you are looking to relax, without the vibe of wanting to be \"seen\" or always be \"on\", there are other establishments with food of equal quality and a less focused clientele."}
{"text":"The butter cake should be illegal it is so good! Always have the most amazing service, and best meals here."}
{"text":"Excellent all around, even better than the Masteos in Beverly Hills!  Food, service, ambiance! Great place for people watching too! Portions are huge,  bone in rib eye large enough to share, lobster fresh and tender, garlic mash and steamed asparagus washed down with cold jalapeno martinis!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy my time spent at City Hall. My first stop is at the bar to indulge in there wonderful martinis and if you are lucky Tammy will be working. She is the most friendly and professional bartender and always remembers your name. The food is consistantly good.  The only reason I give City Hall 4 stars is because they need a new lounge singer and updated decor.  I would spend more time at this establishment if the talent was better.   My husband and I will see you soon Tammy, with out earplugs in :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  Yes a great yet the best Ribeye!  GO for the beef.  You won't be asking where's the beef here.  Really really good.  So if your having a special occasion, this is your place.   THe service is the best.  I really recommend the beef here.  It is  little hard to find.  But worth it.  you won't be disappointed.  I have been here several times and love it every time.  I highly recommend this place.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a special night out to dinner that wil cost you a pretty penny, this is definitely the place to do it.  Started off the evening in the circular bar at the front with live music - great way to enjoy a cocktail before dinner.  Then we made our way toward the dark, chic, modern yet classic dining room.  The service was impecable and the food was amazing.  Be careful how much you order because the portions are humungous!   I had a blackened salmon that literally melted in my mouth, others enjoyed steak and tuna - both delish!  We made the mistake of ordering two shrimp appetizers - man these things were the size of Chihuahuas!! We also made the mistake of ordering the sweet potato fries and they brought us enough to feed a small army.  Don't get me wrong, the food was spectacular, but man it was a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place in Chicago for a long time and finally got my chance at this one in Arizona. The atmosphere is very nice. I had the 22 ounce bone in Ribeye which I order specially prepared and it was perfect. This restaurant is right on par with Morton's Steakhouse (which I frequent in Naperville, IL) in terms of food quality and flavor. I would have gave it a 5 if not for the noise. It was much louder than usual for an upscale steakhouse."}
{"text":"Best dinner of my life. High end steak houses can be pretentious but not Mastro's they no how great they are but they are still humble about it. The bone in filet is life changing, their cocktails and wine lists are to die for. There is nothing that I do not love love love about this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. Still the best ribeye ever. I'm also impressed with the music. It's a great selection and at a perfect level. Quick and friendly service with personality to boot! Service that can make you laugh. Bobby was very attentive and really made us belly laugh. I'm still a huge fan of the infamous lobster mash potatoes. I highly recommend them!    This is my first time with the butter cake. Wow! There's a reason this is their signature dessert.   The GM, Jes, even stopped by to see how our experience was. He was very genuine in his visit and friendly.   City Hall is a great experience! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing place. I have been to 4 different Mastros and I think this one has the best ambiance.  The lobster is always on point and the bone in rib eye and bone in filet are the best steaks ever, 400 degree plate? no prob just be a man a touch it.  Butter cake, was very good and as always service is generally outstanding."}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous.  It was our anniversary dinner and it was off the charts.Mark was our waiter and if we thought about it he took care of it.  We loved the lobster mashed potatos!  Everyone should go here for a dinner they will not forget!"}
{"text":"Everyone from Nebraska thinks they're an expert on beef, and I'm no exception.  City Hall is as good as it gets.  I've eaten at every over-hyped NY steakhouse from Peter Luger's to the 837 Palm, and every douchehole joint in LA and LV, and the only place that MIGHT be better is Gibson's in Chicago - and that's just a maybe.    Filet - top notch.  Porterhouse - the best.  KC Strip - unrivaled anywhere.   The only way to get a better steak is to fly to Omaha, go to Stoysich, grab a slab and cook that sumbitch yourself.  Sides - you can't miss with any, but the creamed corn brings out the corn-fed in me.  Awesome.  And the butter cake... manna from heaven, kids.  Excellent selection of booze and wine.  Always top service.    Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how long this place has stayed awesome - gotta be at least 7 or 8 years now?  The best."}
{"text":"dem sides are gonna hurt!!! 4 solid stars sadly the steak didn't meet my expectations, let me break it down on the goods and the bads  service was excellent, ambiance above par, price $$$ sides were above par the steaks on the other hand sadly were overcharred.  group of 6 dining we all ordered steaks over the 12oz barrier, I chose the coveted 32oz Chefs Cut Rib Eye chop. Lets just say the steak was buttery, heavy, tender, everything you want and more except that char on the outside, literally the char was a tad over kill, if you have to shave off the burnt off your steak to get to the steak there is something wrong. Again steak was excellent minus that char!!  the sides: Bone marrow - ***** scoop it out and butter it up all over the toasted bread you are given, if not eat is straight as it is meant to be eaten, oil, buttery, deliciousness!!!! clam shell mac with buttery cheese - **** what I ate was above par I think the oil from my steak may have skued the taste but was wrong with adding steak juice to your meal haha lobster mashed potatoes - ***** what is not to like, lobster and lobster juice with mashed potatoes camon win win Gorgonzola mac & cheese - *** not a real fan of mac and cheese but their's was decent I know there were two other things our group got but I do not recall what they were or if I tasted them  food *** for the steak, **** for the sides service ***** cup of water always full, asked repetatively if we need anything price $$$ ambiance ***** fancy in here"}
{"text":"Best steak in AZ. Let me say it again, THE BEST STEAK IN AZ. Despite not having domestic wagyu options, this is the place to go for bone-in New York Strip or Filet. This steak is flavorful, perfectly cooked, and felt like it could be cut with a butter knife. The service is top notch and they make you feel comfortable asking questions. It's a bit dark inside,  but the waiters have flashlights. It will be hard to go back to Prime Rib, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, or Donovan's. Enjoy...it's totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth every penny.  Take your best guests, visitors and clients here.  Took my buddy here for his Birthday, and the next year he wanted to go back.  That's really all you need to know.  Steaks can't be beat."}
{"text":"Where do I start?!? Mastro's is one of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience here. You can come for any occasion. I've been here for a girls night out, birthdays, bachelorette dinner party's, a romantic dinner with my significant other, and the staff has always been accommodating.   I recommend you make a reservation unless you plan on just hanging out at the bar. The bar can be very loud so if you plan on having a steady conversation just ask for a table outside of the bar.   The menu is pretty simple but definitely ask your waiter or waitress any questions you may have or if you want them to give you their suggestions.  I suggest you try the seafood tower as an appetizer. You can basically build your own tower with items like lobster, shrimp, oysters, and crab. For your entree you can't go wrong with any of their steaks! I usually always have a problem ordering a medium cooked steak and it not coming out the way I ordered it. Not at Mastro's! I usually get their sea bass and it is always perfect. Not overcooked like most places. For your sides I recommend the lobster mashed potatoes or the gorgonzola mac and cheese. If your looking for a veggie option the grilled asparagus and creamed spinach are great alternatives.   Do NOT leave here with out getting dessert! Sometimes I go just for the dessert. Get the butter cake even if you have to take it to go! It's out of this world. If your not into cake then I would recommend the key lime pie.   Lastly the service. The staff never disappoints. They really do want you to have a great experience so if your not then speak up and I guarantee you they will do something about it."}
{"text":"I went here for a holiday work party and thought it was okay. My biggest problem was that it smelled bad, like smelly fish bad. It's hard to shake that smell. The decor seemed a little dated but most steakhouses kind of end up looking like that. I ate a bunch of side dishes (as a vegetarian) and thought the mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes were the best. The cuts of meat looked huge and everyone I was with really enjoyed them. The flourless chocolate cake was very yummy but also very rich and thick and I doubt a single person could finish the entire dessert after a big steak, so order dessert to share."}
{"text":"Phenomenal steakhouse with a great atmosphere.  The food and the wait staff make this a staple steakhouse if you live in the Phoenix metro area.  Would recommend to anyone with enough expendable income to eat here."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and superb service.  Heavy-handed pours from their well backed bar.  Their Ahi Tuna and NY Strip was outstanding.  Sides were excellent too.  A complete Top Class in my book."}
{"text":"I've been to City Hall on several occasions. Very elegant establishment. I prefer it over the Ocean Club and I do like the Ocean Club! I have sat at the bar and in the dining hall at City Hall. The staff really pay attention to detail and go over and beyond to please their patrons. From the table settings to the food presentation, it's all done to perfection. The foods is always prepared to my liken. The bar area can get pretty crowded Thursday-Saturday evenings. Good musician play here. Unlike the Ocean Club, CityHall has outdoor seating.   Try them out. You will not be disappointed. :-)"}
{"text":"Hands down easily one of the best steakhouse's Ive ever been to. Every year when I am in Scottsdale, I HAVE to go to this place! Service is great and the steaks are even better. Be ready to drop a few extra pennies, but its well worth it! They have this seafood appetizer tower that starts off the meal perfectly! Great assortment of food!!! Great bar as well- you really don't even need to sit down at a table- the place is very entertaining and it seems like they only allow gorgeous women into the place- CANT COMPLAIN ONE BIT!"}
{"text":"This place beats the pants off of Ruth's Chris!! I couldn't believe it! The best bone in filet I've ever had! We love it so much that we have made it a family tradition to go every year around Christmas time as a group. Make a reservation just in case they are too full especially around the holidays! Also ask for Alan he is our favorite server  & he's the man!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That was an amazing dinner.  I was brought here for my birthday (frankly, I'm too much of a miser to spend like this on a single meal), and wow.  Everything (prime rib, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, Malbec) was phenomenal.  I'm not a dessert person, and I wolfed down that warm butter cake that you'll see so many reviewers mention.  It was busy (Saturday night), and parking might've been problematic, except that we used the valet.  If you're going to treat someone to a nice dinner, I say that you do it here.  Absolutely one of the better restaurant experiences that I can remember."}
{"text":"High heat good quality steaks, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. We have been customers of one AZ Mastro's or another for the last 17 years. There is an overall feeling when you eat at a Mastro's: relaxing, taken care of, satiated. Delicious."}
{"text":"Ambiance is far from quiet but fun to be in.  Had the Porterhouse and my buddy had the rib eye.  Both were cooked to perfection and were bursting with flavor.  One of the best steaks I've ever had."}
{"text":"High end steakhouse But well worth it. Allen (server) was awesome. One of the best steaks. Service was impeccable. Side dishes where expensive but very tasty. A great experience. $$$$"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town! I'm a huge fan of ribeye and prime rib so this last time we ordered the 33 oz chef's center cut which is some of both and it was by far the best steak I've had there! That is compared with the bone in filet and ribeye which are also great cuts. Finished off with the butter cake as usual. Never disappointed with the food or service and it is always number 1 on the list when it comes to special occasions."}
{"text":"The good: same consistency you can expect from a Mastro's steakhouse. Excellent food, and I firmly believe you get what you pay for.   The bad: will not hesitate to bump TONS of reservations back if a member of the Cardinals, along with a big ass entourage, walks in wanting to eat. No hostess should allow a pregnant woman to stand in high heels waiting over an hour for a reservation she arrived at on time. And no, I wasn't the pregnant woman, but I sure felt badly for her.   I would say compared to other Mastro's locations I've visited, this one gets bumped down because of the reservation debacle. For us, we had an 8:30pm reservation, but didn't get sat until 9:30pm. Bar was PACKED, and there were no open seats for waiting at all. An hour behind is a lot for a high-end establishment if you ask me.   And one last con... No hot sizzling plate! Ermmmm, why not, guys?"}
{"text":"I got the petite filet. The steak is so melt-in-your-mouth tender it really is like butter!  Better than any Ruth's Chris or Morton's out there!  Roasted brussel sprouts were so good, the sear/char tasted almost like buttery popcorn!  We sat in the dining room, but there was a singer, guitar, and piano player in the bar area."}
{"text":"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.   First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.  If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.  The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)   Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.   you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I only demand the best and this place definitely delivers! I dined here under a reservation with my date and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and overall experience.   When we pulled up (skrrrr) we noticed the line to valet, however the attendants came straight to our vehicle first. So I guess the more luxurious cars are given precedence. That's cool. Because I love favoritism. When I'm on the receiving side, of course. Anyways, the hostesses were very gracious considering we were a tad bit late- but we were sat quickly.   Our server was very professional and competent with knowledge of the menu. She was also very sweet. She recommended the bone-in ribeye and it was very good! I also feasted on oysters Rockefeller  for an app- a bit too salty but excellent nonetheless- and had a fantastic creme brûlée for dessert. Also had the Gorgonzola macaroni with added lobster and sautéed spinach. Sides are shareable. The drinks are crafted perfectly. I had about 4 lemondrop martinis. The drink is put in a shaker and poured at the table. I thought that was pretty cool.  This restaurant has a very lively scene. If you are seeking a more reserved, austere type of place then I recommend going someplace else. It gets pretty loud, too. I had to speak louder than usual when I was talking to my server. The dining area is dimly lit with sort of a pinkish glow. The bar area is great for socializing. You will find a variety of people that dine here. Couples on date night, older executive businessmen, groups of young men, girls night, athletes. I didn't see any young children. Thank goodness. Having kids screaming and running around is the worst and it takes away from your dining experience.   Pretty cool steakhouse."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque!! Cannot put into words how absolutely amazing this restaurant is...service, drinks, food!!! Too much but just enough. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I was to title this review, it would be \"Time to Freshen up\".  When people go to Mastro's they expect first class service and food.  In my experience, they just did an okay job at both.  My fiancé proposed to me at home and then had reservations at Mastro's for dinner that night. It was a big evening for us (obviously) and he wanted to make sure we celebrated.  He spent so much time and effort planning the proposal that he didn't even think to look at the menu for vegetarian options.  He assumed that they would have some... well they didn't.  My only option was to order side dishes individually or they would give me a platter of 4 smaller sized sides.  Side dishes are not a meal, with the level of chefs they have working in this restaurant they should be able to put a composed dish on the plate.  While my side dishes were good, I will never go back.  Vegetarians, Vegans and Gluten-Free diners should have at least one option on every menu (A salad and sides does not count, that is what we order in addition to our meal).  Ten years ago, a restaurant could get away with this, but not now. But,  I am not going to totally bash the food, because the butter cake was to die for, but that is definitely not enough to make me want to go back.    Okay, now for the service.  Let me just say that we waited 5 minutes to be greeted, then another 5 minutes to place our drink order... and then another 5 minutes for our drinks.  Not exactly \"wowing\" the customer from the start. Our server was nice, but overall the service was slow. It was the day before thanksgiving, so they may have just been understaffed.  At the end of the meal we waited at least 10 minutes after we were finished with desserts and drinks for the server to come around again so we could ask for our check.    After reading this review, you may wonder why I even gave them a 3? Well it is Mastro's, they do have a great ambiance and my hottie said his steak was amazing.  If they want to stay relevant with all the great dining popping up in Old Town, they need to freshen up their food menu, narrow down their cocktail list to real \"specialties\" and put more attention into the customer's experience."}
{"text":"This establishment had an absolutely delightful ambiance. The food was delicious and the waiters and waitresses were on point. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Dinning is always a pleasure be it sitting in the bar on a weekend or the dinning room during the week. The seafood tower is amazing. The city hall salad is one of my favorites as well as the butter cake. Pricing on bottles is fair as well."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, grab 6-8 of your closest friends, roll up early and park yourself in the bar for the evening.  Park yourself because the martinis are endless and well maybe that's why everything is so fun at City Hall!   They literally come with a shaker.  Great Lemondrop Martinis (they make the lemon flavored vodka themselves) and one of the best petite filets I've had around town.  There is always a Michael Bublee/Sinatra guy singing the night away and plenty of seats for your beau or date for the evening to watch the game while the girls people watch.  The service can be iffy if you get too into cocktails and neglect to order much food, but generally such a great spot. So put on your favorite dress and sip martinis at city hall this Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  When we found out they were open for Thanksgiving we had to go.  Great food and outstanding service.  The bone in filet is the best I've ever had.  There's an amazing wine list and the butter cake dessert is a must have.  Our server Gary was impeccable."}
{"text":"For fans of Flemings and Ruth's Chris, this is the place.  The menus are all pretty much interchangeable.  They make a very tasty steak.  But I, personally, find steaks, spinach salads, baked potatoes, and steamed veggies boring.  No creativity involved.  Their desserts are wonderful and totally interesting.   This may be a place to see-and-be-seen (ho hum), but it's another upscale steakhouse.   Excellent steaks, to be sure, but a steakhouse.  Third visit and this was the first time that service wasn't up to par.  No one bothered to refill coffee, took quite awhile for plates to be cleared, etc.  Maybe one of the busboys called in sick?"}
{"text":"Incredible. Hands down the greatest steak I've ever had. Prepared perfectly. Wait staff was knowledgable and professional and bar area was great to hang around and people watch while enjoying an amazing meal. Highly recommend the Brussel sprouts as a side...."}
{"text":"First time here last night and I couldn't have been more pleased! Wine selection is great, food was amazing. My boyfriend and I got the friend calamari, bone in ribeye, and scalloped potatoes. All was fantastic. For dessert, we had the butter cake. It was good but not the best I've ever had. Mike, our server, took great care of us."}
{"text":"We arrived, couldnt find our reservation even though they called earlier in the day to confirm.  Lobster bisque watered down, caesar salad with no green color in it, just the worst part of the lettuce, and overcooked sea bass.  Large plates with a very tiny steak or fish in the middle of it, looked like somebody stole our food!  Oh that's right, everything comes on the side, even the salad and you pay monstrous prices for this crap they call food.  Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"shit, i accidentally wrote this review for the wrong business. here are 5 stars, carry on."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience! Wonderful ambiance, great staff, beyond delicious food (I had the filet mignon). Top notch! I truly enjoyed this place immensely. Could not ask for anything more."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at this place but I don't think they really have the best stake in town"}
{"text":"Went here for a girlfriends birthday on Saturday with a large group.  Need to preface this with that statement because it is difficult to get a large group all on the same page.  Some of the group was more interested in the football game in the bar, people having conversations etc.  Our waiter came by initially to take drink orders and let us know that he would be taking care of our table.  When he came back to the table we let him know that they could break down our table because two people were not going to show up.  He displayed visible irritation.  There must have been some kind of confusion because the waiter must have been waiting for the rest of our group to return from watching the football game at the bar before taking our appetizer or dinner order.  We could see that he was getting very irritated with our table so we ordered about 4 or 5 appetizers and more drinks.  And I do recall telling him that the people at the bar will probably not come back till the game is over.  My girlfriend then said to the waiter that we were very sorry and to please not be irritated with us because we had been there a hour and not ordered dinner yet.   He looked at her and said in a very nasty voice that this was how he made his money....  We were stunned that he said that to us.  There was a dead silence at our table.  We were aware of what was going on with our table and would have treated him very well.  Once he said that I had no interest in increasing our tab for his benefit.  I was already full from all the appetizers so I decided not to order a entree and neither did the rest of the table.   I have been here before and have had a enjoyable time... I don't know if the waiter was having a bad day or what.  Not acceptable customer service!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the meal itself was 5 star all the way. I mean hello!?! Butter poached, bone in Filet Mignon!?!  Need I say more? Indeed...  Based on the previous few experiences I've had at City Hall I would have happily given both the experience and the food 5 stars. This time however I cannot, but I can give 4.   We had a 8:00(pm) reservation on a considerably busy night. Upon arrival, we were sat immediately at a booth in the bar. Normally, this wouldn't bother me at all except that when the reservation was taken, we specifically requested the dining room. We were looking for a  level of ambiance that is difficult to obtain surrounded by fairly raucous bar goers on a Friday night. Clearly we were squeezed in at the last minute.   There was no room for us in the dining area so we say screw it, we'll just eat some amazing food, drink way too much and join the 'party' in the bar area. We're not pretentious assholes, we're flexible, we know how to get the fuck dowwwwn, no big deal right...wrong. While being seated I notice the rather close proximity of the patio door. I take my coat off and within minutes I'm frozen. I know what you're thinking...'well, maybe you shouldn't have been dressed like a $3 hooker Kristi', but you would be wrong. I pulled out all the stops for this one. Needless to say, we notified the server and were promptly moved to another booth. Annoying, but certainly not night altering. Our server seemed a bit distracted and it all felt a bit rushed at first but  seemed to mellow out when we made it clear that we were indeed camping out for the next 3 hours.   There is not much that can be said about the food other than 'it's amazing'. I had a perfectly mixed dry Kettle martini to start of with. (Must get buzz going before food consumption) We shared a bottle of Cab with our meals which consisted of the Petite Filet, (MR) the NY Strip, (R) the out of this world Lobster Mashed Potatoes,  and steamed asparagus.   Perfection! This is what a steak should taste like. The Lobster Mashed was divine and trust me, I don't throw the word 'divine' around EVER. We shared the Creme Brulee for dessert as well as a chocolate martini. I was sufficiently liquored up at this point not to mention fat and happy. Don't ask me what happened after dessert because I don't remember. There was some champagne involved, maybe a creepy cab driver....the details are fuzzy. All I know there was enough food left over to make a delicious breakfast of steak and eggs in the morning, which paired well with the Advil, Alka-Seltzer and gray face of death I was wearing.   Whoo-Haa Mastro's! I am no match for your sexiness. U.N.C.L.E."}
{"text":"Got into a conversation today at work about best steak houses.....I know everyone has their favorite so this discussion can really end up being a long one...but it reminded me that I have never reviewed City Hall.   I've been here 4 times now. (In a group of 14 for a work function, on a date, with a friend from out of town and with my mom who came in from out of town)   The group function visit was the only different experience I had as they setup a Pre Fixe menu for us as opposed to opening up the whole menu.   The other times it was full menu.    Now...as I said earlier, people will argue to the death about steakhouse greatness but I am really a huge believer that most amazing steakhouses are equal in flavor but are only separated by finer points like service quality, atmosphere, drink choices and sides.   for example...I dont think you can go to a better fancy steakhouse in AZ then City Hall. Their steaks are dry aged and cooked perfectly, the atmosphere is great for a steakhouse, it feels alive yet intimate at the same time. The service staff has been friendly and knowledgeable everytime i've been there. I've had the NY Strip, Ribeye, Rack of Lamb and Grouper there. I've also had their Creamed Spinach, Lobster Gnochii (sp?), Mashed Potatoes, 5 Cheese Mac & Cheese, Sauteed Onions, and Grilled Asparagus. Honestly? there hasn't been anything in that list I didn't like....I think I would pick the ribeye over the lamb and NY Strip...but there was nothing wrong with either if that is your preference.    Honestly if you are in the mood for fancy steakhouse.....I dont think you will find a better place in AZ then City Hall. However if you are in Vegas....go try the Chili Rubbed Ribeye at SW SteakHouse inside the Wynn Resort.....best steak i've had in my life hands down."}
{"text":"Always nice ambiance! I'm still weary about the salmon I always get  it's easy. Love their raspberry lemon drops (the dry ice effect throws a fun twist on it). There bone in ribeye is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"First, best Cosmo in town! Seriously! Poured on balls of dry ice which keeps it cold, not too sweet and they leave the shaker so you can finish it off. Love the garlic toast in the bread basket! The tuna tower on the appetizer list is enough for an entree. Great steaks and seafood selections and don't forget the double pork chop. But the creme de la creme is the Butter Cake - not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Now this place knows what a steak should taste like steaks were absolutely awesome,juicy, and cooked to perfection, there side dishes were also very tasty if you have a few bucks to spend this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and also wanted to try Mastro's.  We live in Chicago and have one here but figured why not since we are on vacation.  Food for good but the service wasn't up to par with the food.  Our waiter was ok but he was at the end of his shift and asked us to pay because he was leaving.  We were still eating.  This was not the right way to handle this.  We wanted another drink and he said if we need anything else they would start a new tab.  Why would I want to pay twice.  We finished our food and left. We didn't even get to see the desert menu.."}
{"text":"City has it going on!  I've eaten here a few times and can't wait to visit again when the opportunity comes up.  From the moment you enter, the hostesses make you feel like a VIP.  Bartenders are courteous, patient and knowledgeable about everything to do with wine and alcohol.  Servers are educated on the menu and provide excellent selections and advice.  When leaving, the hostesses impress again by genuinely thanking you and inviting you back.  I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions such as an anniversary, birthday, holiday or big date!  You can't go wrong with about anything on the menu.  If something happens to be wrong, they will gladly replace it or re-make it.  They look to provide a memorable experience and meal every time here.    I wish I could give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, stellar service and mouthwatering, five star steakhouse food make this mastros the place to hit on a Friday or Saturday night. Of course it has to be budgeted for because this place isn't cheap, however the see and be seen crowd is here. Live music in the lounge (the singer is beautiful!) maybe a little loud but the wonderful smell of clarified butter while observing the who's who and the pretenders more than make up for any shortcomings. Prepare yourself for an onslaught to your senses. Strong drinks and a server who will remember what you're having. Salads and appetizers that have been thought out, perfectly cooked and well presented. Unless you're having a seafood tower which is perfect in its decadence: both taste and presentation! Highly recommended and it comes any way you want it.  On to the steaks. I recommend skipping seafood as a main course. It's a great steakhouse so indulge or go to the chart house! I've had the porterhouse and the filet but if you like miles of flavor, tenderness and and the perfect combination of butter and seasoning, go with the ribeye.. Easily my favorite and the reason I don't save room for dessert. I've tried the desserts but my goal is to to enjoy the perfection of appetizer and meat. Everybody saves room for it except me and certainly not here! I can't wait for my next visit and now I'm thinking about my next steak.. Maybe this Friday?"}
{"text":"My porterhouse was too salty to enjoy very much of and I forgot my own tip about ordering one step less cooked than liked because the plate will continue cooking the meat.  It was also a lot hotter than usual so it kept spattering me with hot butter.  I think I prefer the ribeye or the filets.  The ribeye has more flavor and wasn't salted as much.  The filets are thicker so the seasoning evens out better.    Mushrooms were delicious as always.  The twice baked potato was a bit too salty as well.  Calamari was average, but hardly battered and came with an unappetizing sauce with a thick hardened skin.  That was a disappointing performance for a restaurant at this level that is usually very consistently good.  Cheesecake is different now!  It has a graham crust and comes with a delicious creme fraiche.  The cheesecake is more creamy and dense, though I prefer fluffy.  Still overall it was a decent dessert.  It'll still be one of my favorite restaurants and my go-to for impressing people, but I'm hoping today's dinner isn't a sign of declining standards."}
{"text":"Great service,  great delivery, great follow up.  Perfect experience. Best filet in years.  And I love steak."}
{"text":"Mastro's is usually pretty consistent, with top quality food and drinks along with outstanding customer service from the staff. This was a disappointment. Waiter hardly came to the table or was involved, the bussers were the only staff that were helpful and even made an apology regarding our terrible waiter. Our water was never refilled. Drinks came well after appetizers and into dinner. A server who was not our server dropped off the check. We had to flag a busser down to give our check to the waiter. We sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for card so we could leave. Won't be dining at this Mastro's again. Lost potential weekly business."}
{"text":"Top 5 steak I've had in my life.  Visited for a business dinner... wine selection was fantastic, service was good (not amazing) but the food was off the charts, especially the steak.  Highly recommend for the food."}
{"text":"This is a review just for the bar area. I eat at the Mastro's in Bev Hills about once a year and love the food, top notch food always.  I have eaten at this location once and the food was great, I wasn't a huge fan of the bar area for after dinner drinks, however, the crowd skewed much older than my preference and I am no spring chicken, the service was very good and extremely  friendly, though, so no complaints there, great wine list despite the fact that the mark up for booze there is nothing short of highway robbery,"}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambience, and wine selection. There was a point knocked off because we had to sit almost an hour before we were sat at the table we had a reservation for at the bar instead."}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's 40th birthday last night.  Sara, our server, was wonderful.  Nice atomosphere.  Great food.  I wanted Lamb Chops but accidentally ordered a Pork Chop.  I am glad I made that mistake.  It was huge, excellent and had an apple pecan sauce that was outstanding.  We recommend this restaurant.  We recommend Sara as well."}
{"text":"Good meal.  Everything was right on, but the noise level was a bit too much for my taste."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Scottsdale! We like to split the bone in filet and a half order of the creamed corn with a half order if the lobster mashed potatoes. The bar area is fantastic with great live music on Friday and Saturday nights. The butter cake is the most amazing dessert. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  This place has the ambiance, live music, service, and delicious food. This place is super fancy and expensive. Our bill with tip was $205!  The bread basket they give you in the beginning is soooo good. Imported pretzels?!? common.. tasted soooo fresh. they also had baguettes of some sort and a few other varieties of bread.. all imported of course. and all tasted wonderful.   Dinner for two consisted of 1 framboise martini which was $18. Strong enough that you only need just one. I dont remember what kind of red wine my friend had ordered but it was about the same price (on a side note the waitress knew the wine menu pretty much inside and out and suggested different pairings).  For our entrées, I ordered the Chilean sea bass and I believe he ordered the new york strip steak, both were about $40.  We should have swapped dishes as he liked my sea bass better as I liked his steak better. Both were cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and buttery - melted in your mouth. The fish was flaky and fresh. This place only comes with entrées sides are all additional.   If you are ever there, you must try the lobster mashed potatoes!! The best buttery velvety smooth mashed potatoes ever! Which chunks of lobster in it!!! hah, and get this. it was$33. .absolutely ridiculous but soooo worth it.    The bar is amazing, full bar with top shelf choices. Live band in the corner ..but they were kinda play country-ish music. The place is dark.. with separate bar seating. and I didn't know at the time as I was in the area visiting but this is a dressy ... dress up place lol just fyi"}
{"text":"Situated next the Scottsdale Fashion Square, you'd expect it would be a classy ritzy place.  And indeed it is.  It's dark ambiance creates a romantic atmosphere great for a date or just a fancy night out with friends.  Though I would say they could've had a brighter candle just so I can get a better look at the great tasting food.  Sure enough I was served with a great bone-in filet, creamed spinach, and an awesome butter cake.  The steak had the bone in which created a succulent flavor.  It was also covered in butter before cooked in very hot temperature which helped to seal in the moisture making the steak very juicy.  The large plate was coated with butter and parsley and probably baked.  As warned by the server, \"don't the plate.\"  It actually sizzled when it was brought out.  The medium rare steak was cooked perfectly.  So moist that it tasted more like butter.  I could almost cut like it was fish.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Adding any sort of sauce would have hid the wonderful taste of the steak.  It was also the thickest piece of meat I'd ever seen.  It's rare that I can find a thick steak that's cooked well.  The creamy spinach was also wonderful.  It was a light cream mixed with the spinach that actually complimented the steak.    I'm usually a chocolate person, but I thought I'd try their signature butter cake this time.  Once you get the cake, start from the center and work your way out.  The moist and fluffy center mixed with the vanilla gelato was superb.  The real heavy whipped cream added to the flavor as well.  The cake was caramelized on top created a crunchy contrast.    All three dishes were signature dishes of the restaurant.  It's no wonder why they are the signature dishes.  You may also try their signature cream corn which I will try the next time.  It may be pricey for some, but well worth its price.  And hey.  It's good to splurge once in a while. :-)"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, the food is fantastic the staff is so on top of things and the people watching is the best in town! Recommend sitting in the Lounge."}
{"text":"After many moons I a fellow yelper has settled in Scottsdale, AZ. So for your own good please hide the cake and cookies.   Mastro's City Hall was the first place I have had the pleasure of visiting I was SHOCKED, do you hear me SHOCKED, that this place was living up to the hyped that I read and was told.   Host: Very friendly and knowledgeable about the place, a party of five of us walked in on a Thursday night around seven (with Reservations). This is where I'm going to have to nick pick a little though, I hate when restaurants have a computer system that they have to pull up your name and want to know what your first pet was and how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie roll lollipop. I gave you my name on the phone and I gave it to you when I enter the place....That is all that's needed, now please sit me and feed me. But she was doing her job with a smile so I played along and gave her my life story and even after the part when i told her about this one time in band camp.......nevermind. We got sat and was told to enjoy.   Service: The service was what i would expect from a steakhouse with the rep it has. Pretentious, snotty, but very professional. We had a wonderful female server who suggested wine and appetizers and specials, the perfect server, until we order the wine. My party weren't big drinkers so we ordered a simply bottle of wine 65.00, nothing fancy(two of us weren't drinking) she seemed a little put off that we didn't order from the \"Upscale\" wine list. Since I love looking around and seeing what everyone one else was doing I notice are server dealing with her other table of 6 gentleman who did order a 200.00 dollar bottle of wine and the 100.00 dollar appetizer giving a little special attention and a lot bigger smile. But those be the brinks I guess. But in the long run she got our food right and had it to us in the proper order and keep my tea full!   Food: The food was great from the scallions to the fillet, even to my rare rib-eye, everything was hot and cooked to the way we wanted. We ordered 3 sides dishes, the scallion potatoes, mushrooms and asparagus was great. I'm normally able to talk someones ear off, but when it comes to the food here you just have to try it cause its so good.   Valet: Maybe I'm just being picky here and if I am, please forgive me but... are you serious about the valets!! For a place like this they should act more professional. One spent the whole time flirting with some girl even as we were getting out of the car, two guys were just standing there and didn't even open the doors, that was just dropping it off. leaving the place we had to try to see if the guy talking on the phone could take his time away from talking to get our car. I'm just saying with the price and service I just received I expect the valets to be a little more attentive.   Overall: Park your own car, make reservations and be prepared to have a great meal with great service(Superior service if you order a 200.00 dollar bottle of wine). In fact i already have reservations for next Saturday!!!"}
{"text":"The bone-in filet is awesome. We tried a variety of sides and they were all delectable. Also, the lemon drop with dry ice is fantastic. All in all, a great overall meal!"}
{"text":"The food is always phenomenal  and the service doesn't miss a beat. While some might find the enviroment a little loud and dark, I think it makes it less stuffy and more accessible to a not over-the-hill crowd.   get there a little early ahead of your reservation time- lots of scottsdale bimbos trying to cut in line."}
{"text":"I'm salivating just thinking about the Mastro's experience. Everything about this restaurant merits 5-stars: from the high quality fresh seafood, beef aged on site... To the BUTTER CAKE!  Start with the seafood tower. Split a Caesar. Bone in Filet Mignon. ...Side of lobster mashed potatoes. Butter cake.  Your mind will be blown, and so will your wallet. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was phenomenal. Definitely a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food/service is always phenomenal just like all the other Mastro's locations.  However, on my last trip here last week for my father's 69th birthday, I came to a realization.  I realized that this location is geared toward younger, club-going people.  Between the very dim lighting, loudness and type of music playing over the speakers in the main dining area it became clear that this was \"Club Mastro's\".  I know the music is meant to quicken the pace of your meal and get you the heck out of there so the next group of suckers can sit, but I don't want to spend that type of money on a dining experience if I am rushed; directly or indirectly.  Plus I don't like to yell to others at my table and then strain to hear what they are saying.  Keep in mind was 6:00pm on a Saturday.  Anyway, I must say again that the food and service were excellent.  Every bit of food that I put in my mouth from the bread, to the salad, to the steak and sides, to the dessert were all top notch.  However, at my old age of 31 I think I'm going to stick to the other regular Mastro's locations and dine with the older folk."}
{"text":"Terrible experience ... was here for a larger work party of about 28 people.  First off, I have only been to this location one other time, but have been to other Mastro's locations several times without issue , so this was just maybe a fluke what happened. There was a COCKROACH  crawling on one of the tables that a guest had covered up with a glass and then informed the waiter, waiter came and put a piece of paper under the glass and removed the COCKROACH with the paper and the glass, didn't change the table linens, no apology from manager, nothing. The bus boy cleaning off the tables had so much on the tray it actually spilled off a bunch of ice, food, and a plate all over one of our guests chairs!!! Thank goodness he was outside when it happened or he would have been hit with the plate on the head. Then, the waiters/busboys just kind or walked past it and did nothing, so my husband yelled at some guy, are you going to clean that up?? Or just leave it? It did get cleaned up, but it should have been done immediately after it spilled, again, no apology, nothing. The waiter/server serving our table reached over me 4 times to serve my husband instead of going around me SERIOUSLY???   And last but not least..... 189$ per person!!! Most of us didn't eat anywhere close to that amount even if we would have ordered off the regular menu..... and there portions were even smaller than the regular menus.....I had a 7 inch flat bowl of Caesar salad, chicken, a scoop of mashed potatoes, 8 half Brussels sprouts, and literally 1/2 a cup of berries for dessert.......no alcohol, just water..... unreal..... I get that it's Mastro's, but this was crazy. Overall, it was just downright embarrassing for us as owners bringing our employees here. We will definitely not make the mistake of going to this location again in the future    Update...... as of February 6th nobody has ever tried to contact me from management to remedy what happened that night. I will not be going to ANY Mastro's establishments after this and have already told many others to avoid this particular establishment ."}
{"text":"Perfect service, attractive restaurant, a great setting for any occasion from casual to formal.    But, our party decided to go all sushi, ordered 7 orders.  That evening (Mastro was our only stop, especially as a group) we all wound up with food poisoning, and a pretty nasty case at that.    I guess the moral is to order sushi at sushi bars, not steakhouses."}
{"text":"The Butter Cake is worth a visit alone. The food is good, the crab legs were too salty. A note: the reservation desk was inept. I made a reservation for 6 people and reserved 3 weeks in advance. It is very expensive. The reservation \"people\" refused to seat me until 3 more of my party arrived. However, they seated  men in suits immediately. They also seated a group of three couples ahead. I don't think it was intentional. However, the reservation people were unhelpful and unfriendly, with phony smiles. However, they seated some men in suits immediately. I suggest  management talk with staff  about discriminatory seating practices. I would return for butter cake and some apps. Its too expensive.  I cant imagine Mastro's corporate reading the review and changing anything. The restaurant is a money making machine for it."}
{"text":"I have been to many of the Mastro's properties. This seems to be the biggest and fastest moving. We met a new friend Chris a first rate server.   You should really try it if you have the mean.   \"Ferris  Bueller\""}
{"text":"Mastro is probably my favorite steakhouse. The food is excellent and the restaurant has a very nice ambiance to it."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and bobby was out server. What an awesome guy! He took great care of us. I would deff go back and ask for him again. He made my night special.  You must for him."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, drinks and atmoshpere. Very classy decor and well dressed patrons. Great lighting and presentation inside I was very happy with my NY Strip on the bone. The Margarita was fantastic as well! A little pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I came back with some friends for dinner and had an amazing experience - great wine, amazing steaks and finished it off with warm butter cake...can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"PERFECTION is the only word to describe City Hall! From the atmosphere, to the incredible service, to the delicious food everything is always perfect!   Although I don't eat meat people I have been here with have said it is the best filet they have ever had. My personal favorite -- the Ahi Tuna. The portion is huge and the fish is super fresh! For the sides, I dream about the Lobster Mash Potatoes! I am also a huge fan of their brussel sprouts, crab gnocchi and gorgonzola mac and cheese.  As if amazing food wasn't enough reason to go here, the service is spot on too.   You will leave here full, happy and with a little less money in your pocketbook, but it is completely worth it. Mastro's City Hall or Ocean Club are go to places for a special occasions, date nights, anniversaries etc..."}
{"text":"This was easily one of the best meals I have ever had, the atmosphere was awesome. Just an all around great dining experience. GET THE CHEESECAKE FOR DESSERT!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate an early Father's Day.  Service was impeccable but then again, our server was a funny, quirky older gentleman. Perfect for us! Calamari was very fresh but a little rubbery.  Sad because it was so tasty. There were tough, overcooked pieces.  Next we had the French onion soup and it was outstanding! Wedge salad bacon smoky and delicious but a bit dry. Crab legs tender and so fresh. Long bone waygu beef porterhouse perfectly cooked and melted in the mouth! Lobster mashed potatoes were so good but way way too salty. Took them home and ate it slowly the next day, still salty but so good. We'll go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Mastro's City Hall for our 10 year anniversary.  We had never been here before, and we wanted to treat our self out to a nice dinner.  The service was excellent.  Just what you would expect.  On to the food.  The fresh bread that they bring to the table was delicious.  We started with the Tuna Tar Tar tower.  It is hit the mark.  Then it came time for the main event.  Of course we went with the lobster mash.  yes they lived up to the hype.  So delicious and filled with lots of lobster.    My wife has a wonderful bone-in rib eye steak.  It was cooker perfectly and tasted delicious.  I went for the chefs cut NY Strip.  To my disappointment it was cook well done and not medium.  The cooked a new one for me, but still missed the mark.  The steak was very charred and closer to rare than medium.  However I did not let this run my meal or the evening.  After dinner was over the wonderful waitress set our table for dessert.  We had not placed an order, but she severed us their famous Butter Cake.  It was simply delicious.  My wife agreed with the waitress that it was life changing.    While I was sad that my steak did not hit the mark, I was still very pleased with the evening.  Besides my was was extremely happy.  So happy wife, happy life."}
{"text":"This is a classic spot. The Bone in Filet is worth every penny. All 6,000 of them. Tender and good. Scalloped Potatoes were a perfect side and the wedge salad was perfect for sharing.  We finished our meal with the famous ButterCake and I can tell you it was phenomenal. Rich and warm it filled us over the top for the ride home. Live piano in the bar area and excellent valet service."}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place a 5 star - but the food and service lacked in my opinion. Maybe the have entered their comfort zone, or maybe I caught them on a bad night - but some things were great and some were not so good.   Start off - they had a Salmon special - but only one piece left. They had other kinds of salmon, but not this one. How that happens when you just opened for the night - is beyond my understanding. But just one and I asked for that - blackened. For some reason I am a huge fan of blackening seafood - and I just imagined it would be awesome.   So Salmon arrived - beautiful and cooked to perfection - except is was not blackened. Not really a way you can fix that - the fish would have been overdone and dry when they 'blackened' it - so I ate it plain. The fish was outstanding in flavor - but there was no way I could be overly excited because it was not to my liking.  Nonetheless - I would go back again - hopefully I can have fish the way I want and hopefully they don't have only one piece for the night."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Scottsdale. The service, the food, the buttercake; all amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was here for a business dinner last week, which is what I would presume most dinners at Mastro's consist of, and we really did have a great time because of the company. You have to go to Mastro's with a lot to talk about because you're not going to talk about the food. It's great, and consistent, but there's nothing to surprise or delight you. It's overpriced steak and potatoes. Don't get me wrong, the sides are good, the fish is good, wine was great, and the service was excellent. Maybe I just find something offensive about paying $65 for a plain piece of seabass on a plate and another $13 for a potato. I do prefer this Mastro's to other ones I've been to though, we sat out on the patio by the bar and it was the perfect temperature, the sun was setting, and the fireplace was on so quite a beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris, Lawry's, and Morton's steakhouses pale in comparison to Mastro's. The steaks were tender, flavorful, and expertly prepared. Definitely the best steaks that we have ever eaten. A place to take someone to impress."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love Mastros but this particular location was different than the others. Too crowded, tables were practically touching, very very loud and the servers could barely hear us or serve our dishes. The food was good however."}
{"text":"4-Stars for the quality of food. Far fewer stars for the experience. We spent over $400 including tip on dinner for 2. The clientele seems to be partly responsible for cultivating this air of Scottsdale snobbery.  Spoiled kids dining out on Dads credit card and driving off with their dates in moms Jaguar; but I digress. Great preparation of our main dishes (NY Strip and Crab Legs respectively). Started with the crab cakes which were awesome. Next we moved on to  Caesar salads, yum, then the main course. For sides, we shared scalloped potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts. Heavenly. The other element I didn't like was the lighting in the dining room. Quite honestly it has the worst lighting of any place of this caliber that I've ever been for dinner. Just dull light that relies on the light from the lounge and the adjoining hallways between the dining room and the bathrooms. In my opinion, it could use table candles or something to give the room some depth.  So for our next visit we'll probably go to another one of their locations but it will be sometime before I have the urge to try it again."}
{"text":"This was our fist time coming to this Mastros establishment.  We have been to the Ocean club and the steak house.   We were seated in a small intimate room which was lovely, our server was very accommodating and the food was delicious.  What wasn't right was the men in the longer white coats standing around in the doorways shooting the breeze, fist bumping and overall being unprofessional.  It was even difficult to navigate passed them when I needed to visit the powder room.  It just really distracted from the ambiance of the evening and was more the behavior of staff at Applebee's or something similar.  Call me crazy but when your spending $66.00 for a steak and $13.00 for a side of steamed asparagus ect, ect there should be more professionalism."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. We entered the busy bar and asked a bus boy what areas were open seating, he replied \"any table without a reservation sign.\" Great. We sat down at a high top without a reservation sign, got menus, and then got kicked out by the waiter who says we should head over to the \"inner\" high top tables, as the table we sat out are actually not available. Great. Ok, so we headed to a high top, in the middle of the bar area (without a reservation sign) and then this time we were told by a manager that this table wasreserved as well. I advised the manager that TWO different staff members told us the high tops in the bar area were first come first serve. She said \"well I don't know who told you that, but you cant sit here and you can get on the waiting list at the hostess stand.\"  I understand if they need to reserve the high tops IN THE BAR, but they need to make sure their staff is aware of the seating guidelines so people like myself don't get shuffled around for half an hour getting treated like idiots. Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner. I understand that it's hard to anticipate when tables are going to be ready. But we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, with no apologies given.    The service was great. Wait staff and servers were very polite. Food came out in a timely manner. Taste of the food was fair. I ordered the bone in rib eye and it was cooked well but heavily seasoned. Sides were fair.    When we were ready to order dessert, we were disappointed that they had run out of their signature butter cake.    I was hoping for a better dinner experience for what we paid."}
{"text":"My first experience here was mind blowing...and its been the same every visit back.  The vibe is so \"smooth\". They have live music in the lounge/bar that is just so relaxing.   You must start off with a martini...not just any martini, make sure they add in the dry ice!!  So fancy! The shrimp cocktail is scrumptious, we always add on an extra shrimp bc it only comes with 3...the shrimps are also pretty big and meaty!  The cocktail sauce, careful, i love it, but the horseradish is very strong in it.  Tears will roll...down your happy face Any finally, the entree....petit filet is perfect for me...comes out on a sizzling hot plate...ugh, my mouth is watering.  This is actually the first and only restaurant where o have not asked for steak sauce...the steak is so flavorful, juicy and perfectly seasoned that it is melt in your mouth perfect all by itself. We love getting the lobster mashed potatoes as a side, as well as any green veggie. Mmmmm, let's go already!!  P.s.  The servers had the neatest little tool to clean up the crumbs off your table!  I want one!"}
{"text":"Five star steakhouse. Service is excellent. Menu selection is great. The steak was out of this world. Must try while in Scottsdale recommend reservations as it was jam packed on Saturday night. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and is so worth the price. The best filet I've ever had in my life and the mac n cheese is to die for. This is a great romantic restaurant to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best steak in phoenix. Yes this place will set you back quite a bit, but if your in the mood for something that will clog your arteries then get ready.   I had the 12oz filet medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. It was served on a sizzling plate. My wife and I shared the lobster mashed potatoes which was ridiculous. It was swimming in a sea of butter by the way, a little overkill but nonetheless delicious.  Desert is a no brainer. Order the butter cake, best thing on the menu i promise you.   Overall I dropped about 175 bucks for 2 people without drinks, but well worth it.."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We did have to wait over 45 mins after our reservations to be seated, but once we were seated everything went very smooth.   Our server John too very good care of us. We had a full course meal from lobster to steak everything was very enjoyable. My friends and I really enjoy this place.  The price isn't cheap but most is great!   I recommend the sea food tower you will enjoy it ;)"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in our experience tonight. I look forward to coming here when I visit Scottsdale but tonight we were seated by the door to the patio and the staff kept leaving the door open. My husband kept getting up and closing it but the cold air made our dinner cold and our experience miserable. Our food was not quite what I remembered it to be in the past but not sure if it was just from the entire experience. The service was not what I remembered in the past as I thought it should have been more attentive. Hope others have a better night."}
{"text":"Wow what a beautiful place full of beautiful people! My wife and I and old family friends went for martini's three months ago. They were delicious and had an extra surprise in our one friends drink...a roofie. Such a fun time watching a 77 year old man get completely plastered off of 1  1/2 martini's. Oh and his torn rotator cuff from falling down on the stairs makes it a night that keeps on giving. The unconcerned staff were a real gem as well as we had to help him to the car while they stared and whispered. Not planning on returning soon. Ladies be warned you may wake half naked in a trailer after a few drinks. And wouldn't that just ruin your Diane Von Furstenberg cocktail dress."}
{"text":"Tables are incredibly and uncomfortably close together. You either hear everything the table next to you is saying or you feel like they hear your conversation. It is not private and/or romantic setting. Food is soaked in butter. I had a stomach ache after from the amount of butter in the food. Food is over priced for the quality. Steak is USDA, but it isn't grass fed so it's basically terrible quality for what you pay. Portions are way to large. I regret the money spent on the meal. Would never go back and never recommend."}
{"text":"Drinkwaters is the best steak ever.   Ive been here a few times and im always impressed.  The service is always great, food is always fantastic, and wine list is very impressive.  If you go, you will not leave unimpressed.  Also make sure to get the lobster mashed potatoes if they have them."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a huge fan of Mastros. We've yet to have a bad meal, we have one complaint that to us should have really been disclosed. When told about the specials of the night our waiter mentioned truffle butter. When it came time to order I added truffle butter to my steak. Loved it! However once we received our bill we noticed we were charged $15 for MAYBE a tablespoon of butter. I could not believe it! I would highly suggest advising people the price on all of the \"specials\" of the night. I was extremely upset about it."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very dark which we didn't love but noise level was ok. Crab cakes were ok- not super flavorful. House salad was disappointing, as were scalloped potatoes and steamed spinach. Steak was good we got filet and ribeye. Cooked well. Noticed they really try to up sell you on the most expensive items on the menu. Would recommend steak 44 over this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was treated to a delectable dinner here for my birthday and fell in love with the ambience and the service immediately.  Our server, Miko was prompt, polite, and made excellent suggestions for my two began friends who ate with our party.  I chose the miso glazed salmon with delicious Brussels, and it was heavenly.  Between the delicious food and the perfect cocktails (which were brimming!), I can't decide what was the best part of the night.  One thing is for certain: I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE when a vendor takes you out for a meal and they made an amazing choice with Mastro's.  We had a private room in back with a cocktail reception in the courtyard.  The atmosphere and service is typical for an upscale steak house.  This place was packed for a Wednesday night so I assume it is wise to make reservations.  The hosts ordered the sides family style and we started with a few shared appetizers.  The steak sashimi was definitely my favorite with a butter-like texture and a delicate seasoning.  The shrimp cocktail was served with dry ice so it looks like it is steaming on the way to your table.  The shrimp were large almost prawn size-like.  However, it wasn't anything extraordinary just some large shrimp with homemade cocktail sauce.  The sides were the asparagus, roasted brussel sprouts, garlic mashed potatoes, and mushrooms for the steak.  I opted for the bone-in filet which was done impeccably.  All the sides met expectations but I have to say I liked the mushrooms the best.    This is your typical upscale steak house so the expectations are high just like the prices.  However, the signature warm butter cake blew me away.  If you go here get the cake or just come here for dessert and skip the protein."}
{"text":"Although we were told our reservation was running on time, we were seat almost 30 past. That still won't change my 5 star rating. The food, wine and service was perfection. We had the heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese, steak, prawn, mushroom and the twice baked potato. When the waitress said the prawns were large, it was an understatement. It was bigger than my forearm! If you make you way over, be sure to save room for the best butter cake and whipped cream EVER. Mastros was the cherry on top of a perfect date"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks Ive ever had! Had a large selection of wine, which is always a plus. Service could have been a bit better."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, service was ehhhh...  Fine dining is an experience, not just good food and wine. Our server was inattentive and we kept having to wave him down. Not really acceptable if you ask me."}
{"text":"unreal.  best steak house in america and best mastros of them all!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of my all time favorites in Scottsdale. Consistently good steak (please tell me you'll never go to grain fed bland beef) and equally great people watching in the bar. If you get some time or are hanging with friends, grab dinner in the bar while the piano man sings. And you must simply get the mashed potatoes - they are amazing. Additionally, they have a great price on Caymus Conundrum."}
{"text":"I have had past success with great meat, service and sides, but last week's experience delivered grisly meat that seemed out of step with the quality they delivered in the past. I don't know whether they have changed meat purveyor's or grade, but our steaks were a marked departure and disappointment from all of our previous visits. The staff did a great job quickly replacing the first cuts, but the replacements didn't shine."}
{"text":"Decadent.   Need I say more?  We started with wonderful (free) breads and our server warned us the pretzel bread is addictive. My guess is there's 6500 calories per basket of bread, so pacing yourself is key.  We skipped appetizers and dug into Mastro's always excellent steak and seafood. We had an 18 oz bone-in filet and wild caught Columbia River Sturgeon prepared on the grill and slightly blackened. For sides, we had lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.   For $37, this is the best Lobster Mashed I have tried with a decadent amount of butter- A cardiologist's dream dish!  City Hall was swarming with professional baseball players including my dinner guest. Hence, the bread basket was emptied and the 18 oz filet completely cleaned. City Hall features a wonderful wine list and by my rough estimate, there's 1500 bottles sitting in the very back. Even wine by the glass has a reasonably good selection. Our server tipped us off that we should order out of the right 2 sub zeroes stocked with Screaming Eagle and rare Bordeaux's.   Excellent meal!  Food 5 Star Ambiance 5 star Service 5 star"}
{"text":"This is an update to my review of October 14, in which I gave Mastros a poor review. I spoke with the general manager about our experience, and he graciously offered to have me and my date return for another meal, and provided a $200.00 credit towards this. We returned this past Saturday, October 22, and were  personally greeted by the GM, Jess, and escorted to our table. The service was excellent, and the meal exceptional. We began with the ahi tuna tostadas and French onion soup, both of which were delicious. I ordered the 18 oz bone in filet mignon, which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My date had the Chilean sea bass, which was tender, moist, and delicious as well. The sides of creamed spinach and gnocchi were fabulous, and we ended with the amazing chocolate sin cake. We had multiple servers tending to us, and the service was only surpassed by the food. I have eaten at many fine restaurants around the world, and Mastro's is a fine restaurant, on par with excellent restaurants in New York, London, or Paris.  When you are looking for a romantic restaurant for a special occasion, or any occasion, by all means come here! The attention to making sure we had a memorable experience is rare, and this establishment went above and beyond to rectify our first dinner and ensure we were properly taken care of. A real class act! Well done and thank you!"}
{"text":"Had another really good meal at Mastro's.   Again, the steak was very good, just as I remember it being last time.     A few notes:  - Music was better, no terrible live band.  - The sides both had an excessive amount of cheese.   For me to say that, it had to really be excessive.   (Mac & Cheese and Potato Au Gratin).   I didn't think it was possible, but you actually CAN put too much cheese in Mac and Cheese.  Don't ask me to explain it, I cant, but it really happened.   - Wait staff was excellent.  Our waiter oozed professionalism."}
{"text":"This has been the best restaurant experience (x3) I have had since moving to Scottsdale from NYC. Unfortunately, the next time I come, I will have to sell off my first born-- well future first born.  Everything is right about City Hall. The ambiance, the service, the food. Dear god, the steaks are orgasmic!  I have been in Scottsdale for 10 months, and the food scene here is reminiscent of NY in the 19--- well, no its not reminiscent of any time period of NYC.   I applaud many of the up and comers and hope they are able to find their footings, but the way to keep your customers is to provide exemplary service. To date I have only found that type of service here at City Hall.  I don't need a hipster server to take a seat in the booth with my date and I amd start pointing to various menu items- um- you are not eating with me! I don't need a server to pull out crayons and start circling menu items on the place mate cuz, I am NOT 5 years old!  As an adult, I do like having a cocktail at the bar, served by a very professional bartender, having my cocktail brought to the table (and in some cases have the tab transferred). The live music, is on the muzak side, but that kitsch is the only thing that is out of place here. Though, may I say it is fun to sing along in my Wayne Newtown swagger!  Very attentive waitstaff going through the gi-normous offerings of the menu and cautioning to not over order (thanks!) and bringing the extra Atomic Horseraddish to make my face feel like its about to fall off.  The Porterhouse is to die for, Seafood, amongst-- NO-- the freshest I have had in Scottsdale (yes, even fresher that the Salt Cellar) The desserts, well lets say they are heavenly. Hard to eat the molten cake after gorging myself on a ridculous amount of food, but YUMMMM....  But it all comes with a price. I have been lucky to have come here with an ex- boyfriend that loves this place. But now that he is gone, I will have to resort to selling my furure first born child on Craigslist to sate my desire to have another porterhouse at City Hall."}
{"text":"I was here last night with my wife and we were both disappointed with the steaks. I been to Morton's in Scottsdale and I consider both restaurants to be in the same category. Morton's was better.  What makes this bad is that Long Horns in PHX rib eye steaks are literally better! That's not an exaggeration! Way juicier and more flavorful. I don't get how I can get the same cut of meat and pay easily more than double at Mastro's.   Over all I was super disappointed with the steak. Mash potatoes were good and service was fantastic. That is why this rating gets 2 stars. For the service, and the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Mastros City Hall for Valentines Day.   The meal was superb!Top quality filets.  Plus that service was outstanding.  Lauren was our server and she was excellent as was the entire crew of support staff!"}
{"text":"UGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! Lovely atmosphere, loud & if you are wanting to spend spend spend then this is the place...I am only focusing on my starter - Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Presented in a swimming pool of balsamic, not drizzled with a delicate flavoring which allowed the tomato flavor to come through, no hint of black pepper - there was basil I think but could not tell - I really can't go further than that, the rest of the meal was just a sad....Mastros - please note you have a spelling mistake on your website menu http://www.mastrosrestaurants.com/Locations/AZ/11-City-Hall-Scottsdale-Main/12-Menu/Default.aspx"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best steak in AZ !!! WE love seating at the bar. Great bartenders, strong drinks, good ,usic, great people watching and amazing steak ! You just can't go wrong ."}
{"text":"Zero stars please!!!!  Simply put the restaurant is a perfect place for racist and sexist men!!! If you are a person of color or a female, think twice before going to this restaurant. If you happen to have both traits... good luck! We felt extremely unwelcome the moment we set foot in the restaurant, rudely treated by the waiter and later accused of lying!!!!!  The food was alright but not good enough for the price. However, what was unbearable was the attitude the manager and waiters had towards us their customers.  Would I ever go there again? Hell No!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Mastro's for my birthday and WOW-they aim to please! From the warm greeting to the amazing bread basket (pretzel, cheese crisp, sourdough, etc. and all mouthwatering), and the tasty drinks (they give you the entire shaker for refills) to the truly incredible entree, the evening was wonderful. We both got the filet, we ordered garlic mashed potatoes for a side, and we're thrilled with everything."}
{"text":"I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?"}
{"text":"MMMM MMMM GOOD!  I went to Mastro's City Hall with a group of 20 people.  We had a private room in the back with a clear shot to the kitchen.  Everything about our experience from start to finish was impressive.  The decor was beautiful.  The entire staff was accommodating to various food allergies, very diligent and friendly.  I was the only vegan in the entire party and was thrilled with the vegan meal brought to me, with complete awareness of all allergies I specified in the beginning of my meal.  It was not only an exceptable meal for me, but actually delicious.  18 of the other guests had not one single complaint...the sides were GINORMOUS, the meals cooked to perfection.  Only one of our guests had to send back his steak (twice) due to it being over cooked and then once again undercooked, but, the staff was very gracious and stayed on top of it until the order came out to satisfaction.  Would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native I spent countless meals at Mastro's in the city. As a new resident of Scottsdale I assumed the service and food would be comparable. To my dismay, that was not at all the case. My boyfriend and I went for my birthday back in May and we had an amazing waitress. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Upon leaving the restaurant we had only eaten about half our meal. We had the server box our food up and they gave us a bag to take home. The following day I opened the boxes in the bag only to find the left over cake and whipped cream and none of the other food. (We had a whole steak and three sides that were hardly touched.... that were not given to us). At a place like Mastro's I should not have to check my boxes to make sure they packed it up correctly. This was completely unacceptable.  We went again last night for our anniversary and we had the same waitress who was amazing again. When the serving man was serving my Mac and cheese he asked how much I would like and I said as much as possible. He then spills Mac and cheese all over my $1000 Vince leather jacket and says \"oh, well you said to pile it on, haha\". He goes on with what he's doing and doesn't help clean or ask if I need a napkin. I had to stop a different server to ask for a new napkin. This is completely awful and I will not be going back to Mastro's after these two horrible experiences. My jacket is completely stained and I left with a sour taste in my mouth because of the lack of customer service.  I would not have written this if the server had just been a little more polite and given better service. I will not be recommending anyone here."}
{"text":"Was here last Monday, week before the Super Bowl.  I'm not a local, but I was on a pseudo- double date, if you will, and we were pretty much minding our own business until... pro athlete sightings!  Everywhere!  Our waiter (who was the nicest EVER and was so down to earth-- LOVED HIM-- tall black man named Carell?  Name slips my mind, but he was awesome) graciously came up to us as we were checking out (AMAZING STEAK cooked TRUE to temperature-- beware!  Sides are delicious!  Wine list fantastic!) and told us we were welcome to stay put if we wanted to see FIFTEEN of the NY Giants who had just walked in and were waiting for a table to be set up.  We thanked him, declined the invitation, but what do ya know?  We were walking out the door, and who should walk right by us but EMMITT SMITH?  My friend (lifelong Dallas fan) turned on her heel and ran after him, just as her husband began making fun of the Dodge Magnum out front who was being driven by-- what do ya know? Robert Kraft, owner of the Patriots, who we didn't know until the valet guy informed us after seeing the look of confusion on our faces when we saw him yell \"See ya on the field!\" to whoever else was in the valet line behind or in front of us.  Also saw Dan Marley who I'm told frequents this spot.  Saw a few other football players there, and while I'm not a stargazer, it was still fun and exciting to be in such a hotspot, looking for Super Bowl rings on every \"big\" guy in the place.  I'm told this place, while it's not usually so full of pro-athletes is a seen-and-be-seen place... with muy delicioso food.  P.S. My one complaint,and we didn't notice til the morning after: upon bringing us the check, the table was immediately cleared by bussers, and we weren't asked if we would like to take home our leftover sides (which were abundant in quantity and absolutely delicious).  We didn't notice until the following morning when we woke up starving for leftovers and had none.  Upon consulting the two gentlemen we had been with, we realized no one had been asked.  Disappointing.  I wonder if that was a mere oversight or a regular practice."}
{"text":"This place is a little more expensive than most higher end steak houses but they are also a little better. They really try to do  things over the top. This is a great place to take someone you want to impress. The service is the best we have had in the Phoenix area. Every food item we ordered was also wonderful. the crab appetizer, french onion soup, bone in rib eye with bernaise sauce and butter cake. We also loved that they had all of our favorite red wines from Napa."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a weekend and visited 2 steakhouses.  One, Mastro's, gets high marks for everything - the other, Bourbon Steak... Meh.  The crab stuffed mushroom caps and the seared ahi tuna apps were wonderful, but the real highlight was the filet.  It was not as thick as the filet I have come to expect from so often visiting Bob's Steak and Chophouse in San Francisco, but it was perfectly cooked and had a slight crispiness to the outside of the steak which was wonderful.  I would be hard pressed to say it was as good as Bob's, but it could be a very close 2nd place.  A friend told me to try the lobster mashed potatoes, but they were not on the menu the day I was there.  So if reading this stimulates your desire to eat at Mastro's don't forget to add this to your order.  I will definately go back next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I booked dinner reservations for a group of about 30 people and every single one of them raved about the food, service, and atomsphere. Before dinner, every local who asked where we would be eating had nothing but good things to say--and they spoked the truth!  The appetizers were delicious. Seadfood was fresh (we ordered the towers). We actually were too full from appetizers to eat our steaks, but what I did tastes was superb. Our waitstaff was imepeccable--wish I remembered the head waitress' name because she was awesome to work with.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My five stars are for the steak! Talk about perfection! There are two things I would change if I was the owner. The dark room is way too dark. Everyone there had to use the flashlight setting on their iPhones to read the menu. Remember I noticed everyone was 45 or so in the place. We all need glasses just to read the menus anyway. Something the owner should change is make it a tad bit more lighted. The pecan pie and choc cake we ordered for dessert had a freezer taste. My first time there so I will try the cheesecake next. Wouldn't ever get that pecan pie again! If you have an excellent menu with main dishes and pride yourself on great food! The owner really needs to get better tasting and fresher home baked goods in. I'm a pastry chef and know good baked goods! These are not fresh baked by any means. Adored the steak! Not the baked goods"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, fun atmosphere, great spirits and food. Had the filet, was out of this world, melted in your mouth kind of filet.  They had a live band playing and it was a very happening kind of place, it was packed.  Great place to go as long as you dont mind the noise as it is so crowded and also with the band it can get a little noisy but great food and time to be had otherwise.  Fun Place!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Believe the hype. Everything you read.   We had sides. We had wine. We had butter cake (which was also great- maybe not quite in the category of \"best dessert I've ever had\" but still really good and HUGE to split). But the shining star of the night was the steak, which is how it should be.  I agonized over my choices, since I realized everything would be great but wanted to get the best possible combination of tenderness and flavor. The server recommended the Kansas City, which was a cut I hadn't heard of before. He described it as having the fattiness between a NY and Ribeye, and great flavor. It was cooked perfectly, and oozed steaky amazingness with every bite. It comes out after being broiled at 1200 degrees for a great char on the outside. Some others in my party got truffle butter on their steaks and said it was so over-the-top awesome, but it's hard for me to imagine it would get much better than my steak by itself.  Headed back to Phoenix next week again.  Dare I indulge again???"}
{"text":"Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they \"usually\" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.  They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!  Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!  My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!  We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a \"Steakhouse kinda girl\" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.  P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)"}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of hype around town... I randomly ended up stopping in as a third wheel, while one of my good girlfriends was on a date.  Somehow I ended up being a chaperone, but I must say the 3 of us had a blast!  The food and drinks were very good from what I sampled.  I ordered a dirty martini w/ three blue cheese olives, and the bartender made it just the way I like it and gave me the excess in a shaker to keep @ my table.    The scallops here are amazing... they are seared to perfection and the sauce served with them is absolutely delicious!  The service here was SUPERB, but my review may be a bit biased because my friends date seemed to know most of the staff by name ... So I can't say that it would always be this good ...  I did try a bit of the butter cake, and despite many people raving about it... I am not a fan... it was verrry sweet and heavy - it actually gave me an upset stomach/indigestion afterwards... but that isn't too surprising since I rarely eat \"cake-like\" desserts like this...   The atmosphere is ehhh you know old townish - it appeared like more of a mature crowd, which isn't surprising because the tab on 3 drinks @ the bar was nearly $60.  It's nothing glamorous or super ritzy as I thought it would be.... It's actually way more chill and of course it was suuuuper busy since it was fri night!    So does it live up to the hype and did it meet my expectations?    Well this is a bit tricky to answer, because I figured it would be high end/classy and that it would be expensive ... And YES it was!  The overall scene though was just alright for me - the look of the interior of this place is nice, but nothing to brag about ... There are a lot of similar places in Scottsdale, but I must admit the did sear/season their scallops to perfection!! But similar to other mastro's - it's quite expensive and I'm not really sure how fast I will be returning ... I would rate it a very good, but not the best bang for the buck, but they do have quite an extensive menu - they even had wagyu beef in their menu!"}
{"text":"It's good to know people in HIGH places! Does a review even need to be left for this highly esteemed establishment? I think not. But, because I've been coming to the Mastro's restaurants for what seems a century, all I will say is 'Perfection'. From the food, to the wine and drink offerings, to the staff and the ambiance. Oh, the ambiance. Take your date here to impress. Take yourself here to eat superb food. A fun place to mingle too. Five stars for all around doesn't do it justice. Everything is addressed at this restaurant and they treat you well, quite well. They go above and beyond to make you happy and content with your dining experience. Side note: Splurge on the Lobster Mash for the table. It's well worth it. Every time! Nobody makes a better ribeye in the valley. Melts in your mouth. I'm hungry now..."}
{"text":"Was charged two extra bottles, manager said we ordered two and declined , we responded we did not do that then manager said due to technical difficulties we charged two extra bottles and Walked away Server was rude from beginning"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in the Valley!  Best filet mignon in town!  Lobster mashed potatoes are delicious.  Dungeness crab cocktail is amazing!   All sides are wonderful.  Service is top-drawer"}
{"text":"Incredible service. Exactly what you would expect from a Mastro's venue.  Everything was perfect, and to add a cherry on top, they brought out a beautifully designed desert for my wife and mine's anniversary on the house.  Had an amazing evening. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service & decor + live music!  Love this place."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!  Be VERY careful and watchful of the VALET PARKING STAFF...  We discovered a deep scratch in our SUV the following morning after eating here.  It's our fault for not addressing it that evening, but it was very dark and quite frankly we never would have noticed it without a flashlight anyway.  The food here is great as expected, but you should know this is where all the fake, plastic Scottsdale \"Be's\" and \"Wanna Be's\" go.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I surrender to the Carnivore Food Gods!  Made sure I was not late for my reservation. Got there and suddenly felt under attired! Asked the valet what he thought and he said \"oh! very casual...no need to worry...\" And so begins my story. Decided to dine at the bar (my favorite place most of the time) rather than at a table already reserved for us. Dining at the bar in itself was a great decision.   Ambiance? outdoor fire place for the wintery days and the patio dining. Main Dining Room sexy and well laid out (for those of you from Hawaii, the dining room is similar to Morton's and how Morton's is laid out) and the bar is huge! a rectangle surrounding the bar with at least 40 seats and high tops surrounding the bar area (nice touch). Regardless of where you sit; the table is set for a perfect 5 star meal!    Mastro's house salad- iceberg lettuce and freshly chopped tomatoes with shrimp floating around the salad chased my Bone In Ribeye OMG!  The King Crab and Truffle Gnocchi was absolutely amazing which was broiled but still creamy and the hint of truffle JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT...  Crème brulee for desert and it was served with a scoop of fresh tossed fruits laced in some sweet liquor and a bowl of FRESH WHIPPED CREAM.....   Oh! they did give us a basket of breads to chase our bottle of champagne  A perfectly prepared meal and the service? 6 stars! from the valet, to the hostess, to the bartender (our server) and the ladie's room attendant! Who could ask for more service!  My plan is to try the other Mastro's locations in the PHX area.... If I had to rate the PHX City Hall location to the other Mastro's in OC, CA, I'd have to give the thumb's up to PHX City Hall.  Oh! One more thing! Live entertainment; pianist and singer with perfect selection of music to fit the fare!"}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse is an Excellent restaurant, bar and vibe! I enjoyed the ambiance Mastro's has to offer as well as it's amazing eats. The front Hostesses Staff are very pleasant and welcoming. The bar itself is impressive. A great selection that is displayed that had me in awe....along with that they offer and support \"HOPE Wines\". They have a variety that they offer and each wine that is selected 1/2 the proceeds go to that charity! Super cool right?! HOPE Wines is great. I met with the Cofounders in an event in Los Angeles for a Cancer Charity and it was great to know about them. For most part you can fine their wines through \"Whole Foods\" or other higher end grocery stores, unless people start requesting them to have that change.   Hope Wines: http://www.onehopewine.com/  It possibly touches me that I am majoring in nursing and healthcare is a passion.   Thanks Mastro's for being a Supporter and offering their wines through your fabulous Steakhouse.   I love Mastro's it's delicious! Go out and have a great time at Masto's. The clientele are very nice too. : )"}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail and tuna tartare are amazing. If you're really ballin try the seafood tower, it is out of this world."}
{"text":"I usually have great things to say about Mastro's but this location was unimpressive.  It is shocking how dark they keep it - I attended a business meeting here and was escorted to the back room (across from the kitchen) down an extremely dark hallway.  A flashlight would have come in handy!  We had a pre-fixe menu which is standard with our group size and the nature of our meeting, but I felt that the quality of the food may have been diminished due to this.  I ordered a filet 'medium' (I know steak lovers, I know!) and so did two of my counterparts at the table.  Every filet that was cooked 'medium' came out different - to the point of it being laughable.  One most definitely had a well done filet (which no one ordered), mine was medium rare (more on the rare side as it was red but still warm throughout) and then one was correctly medium with a warm pink center.  I am not sure if there were multiple chefs attending to our meals or ???  Since there was a presentation in progress there was no way of alerting the staff and we dealt with what we were served and traded amongst ourselves.  The most surprising thing was that our wait staff were crude and you could tell they were bitter that evening - about what I am not sure.  (I should not generalize it was two of the staff, the rest were fine but certainly not exceptional as I am accustomed to at Mastro's)  The presentation was only for half of our time at Mastro's, so there was plenty of time for the staff to interact with us.  One of my coworkers asked for a sparkling water and the waiter acted like it was a chore and asked another staff member to fulfill her request - they argued back and forth in front of us.  Unreal for a high end establishment.  I was also declined a hendrick's and soda due to it not being part of the pre-fixe meal - and definitely in a rude way.  No other place that I have attended similar meetings at has done this, rather bring me the bill upon completion of our meal.  Surprising again, but c'est la vie.  There are so many wonderful steakhouses in Scottsdale - I would recommend another venue."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite favorite restaurants. I love the chop salad their steak is the best steak you will ever have. The breadbasket is wonderful. And even their fish just melts in your mouth. The lively bunch in the bar is my favorite place to sit . I love the music the vibe and the bar staff top notch"}
{"text":"I ate here for free I went to CE dinner here, and the party was small  15 or so.  So it's not cause I was with a huge party that had to be served all at once and the restaurant was filled at perhaps 40 percent of capacity. I had a filet, mash, creamed spinach and i forget what else.  I ordered my steak medium, what I got was near well.  I think if you were to pay 50 dollars for a steak you would expect at a minimum for it to come out cooked properly. I've been to other places where they heat the plates to crazy temps and I love food at crazy temps so i was excited! But the plate was soooo fire hot, that by the time it stopped sizzling fat up in my face, it was med-well to well.  Let me tell you too, I can eat food at really hot so I imagine a lot of other people ended up getting food that was well done and well done steak (don't get me started on well done steak, it should only be eaten by immunosuppressed people).   So quite a disappointment,  If I would of paid I would of sent that sucka back.   The mash was pretty tasty, and creamed spinach was alrighty.   The meat was high quality I think, but how could I know it was cooked to oblivion."}
{"text":"Hands down, best steak of my life. We split a bunch of side dishes and they were all excellent, I especially loved the crab & truffle gnocchi and the lobster mashed potatoes (I know, that might have been a little too much). The service was fantastic. One thing to note is that it's very loud, we had a party of 6 and had trouble hearing each other. Don't let this stop you from eating at Mastro's though!  Take this advice: no matter how full you are, order the butter cake for dessert. I promise you won't regret it. I can't wait to come back here - hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. We ordered lobster mashed potatoes, cream corn and two 8 oz steaks (sirloin). This place is AMAZING. Service was great My friends steak wasn't cooked medium rare it was cooked medium well. We had it sent back. The manager came to our table to apologize he even gave us a discount on our bill. Not necessary but definitely nice knowing how much they care about providing good service to Their customers. Now I don't think I can ever eat cream corn or mashed potatoes any other way! Too good!"}
{"text":"Excellent overall...prompt seating, solid service, excellent food. Steaks are great and highly recommend truffle butter on your steak. Had the sea bass tonight it was cooked perfect but nothing holds a candle to their steak. Cherry crisp for desert was awesome, nice change from butter cake."}
{"text":"I really love steak.  I really love prime rib.  I really wish I could form coherent thoughts about how good this steak was.  I can't.    You really have to try it out for yourself.  Now if you will excuse me, my drool is going to ruin my keyboard."}
{"text":"The meeting facility at this location is not the best. It is basically a long slender room. The parking spaces out front are valet only, so when the meeting lets out you either have  1) 50 people waiting for 2 valet drivers to get their cars that are parked ten feet away Or 2) people park in a parking garage and have a very looooong walk around the building   The filet was not the best. I really really liked the butter cake though. I'll try dinner again just to order the butter cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Yes, it's true that I would have been happy eating anywhere on the night of my birthday while getting wined and dined by my bf, but it just so happened that I was taken to City Hall, so it was a delightfully tasty night!  The minute I stepped into City Hall, it felt like I had left Old Town Scottsdale and entered a city steakhouse in a Chicago or SF. It was cozy, dark and smelled absolutely delectable. We began the night with some cocktails at the bar. I ordered a delicious fruity beverage and enjoyed it as as the evening air blew through the open doors of the patio.   Following our cocktails, we were seated in the dining room and the birthday feast began! We enjoyed delicious pretzel bread, crunchy Cesar salad, filet, macaroni and cheese and Lobster mashed potatoes. That's right. Lobster mashed potatoes! Every bite was bliss and I ate until I couldn't psychically take another bite. The mac and cheese has got to have about five different cheeses in it and each bite is filled with gooey cheese that melts in the mouth. The Lobster mashed potatoes are just as delicious as they sound and are filled with butter garlic and plenty of Lobster meat. The portions are hefty and we luckily had leftovers to enjoy tonight! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and helpful.   I'm not sure there's much more than I can add, but if you're in the mood for delicious steak and complimentary sides, I suggest keeping a Mastro's in mind."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined at City Hall many times and enjoyed it, but this past Saturday (2/15) was the worst experience ever. We go to that particular restaurant because I love the ambiance and the intimate settings. This past Saturday instead of sitting in the restaurant we had to sit outside (which we did not request) at a card table with a padded folding chair. In addition, there were so many tables it made it difficult to have a truly romantic dinner. In addition, the service was way below par than normal. Probably because they added tables but not wait staff. The great service we come to expect at this restaurant was not there. Finally, I ordered the filet and it came out charred and I had to send it back. Finally, City Hall's side dishes are meant to be shared family style. My husband and I ordered the scallop potatoes to share and we were charged twice for the side dish. The reasoning, because there was two of us, even though we told the waitress we are sharing one dish. We had spent over $400 (including tip) and instead of appreciating their customers and delivering quality service, they are more interested in quantity and stuffing people into the most uncomfortable settings."}
{"text":"My dad is amazing. You know how guys always fear girls with \"Daddy Issues\" because they're usually extremely effed up after being utterly neglected by their father throughout their formative childhood and therefore seek the approval of men via ridiculous drama-filled dating antics for the rest of their life? Yeah, I'm not one of those people. My dad is one of my best friends. I even started giving him the fist bomb, complete with the added explosion, to celebrate our comradery.   My dad comes into Phoenix to visit me about twice a year. Clearly, I bookmark the most expensive places that I could never go but would really like to visit for times when I know he will be in town. Mastro's was one of those places. He took me and about 8 of my closest friends out to dinner here and it ranks as one of the greatest meals of my life.  We started with a the seafood tower that came with unbelievably fresh seafood (even for non-arizona standards) complete with a dry ice presentation that made us the center of attention for at least 15 seconds.  Heellllls yeah.    The food was amazing, but at $50 a plate, it should be, so I won't elaborate too much. What was surprisingly awesome was our server. He wasn't at all stuffy or condescending, looking at our table of many twenty somethings accompanied by one somewhat obnoxious 50 year old (my dad).  He even politely played along with my dad's joke of leaving a Giant Eagle \"Frequent Shopper\" card as payment for our bill of well over $500.    One of the best nights of my life, period. If I can ever afford it again, I wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Me and my girls made reservation to eat here on a Saturday night during Restaurant Week. The place was full of energy and people when I walked in, I was amazed at all of the platters of sizzling food as we waited to be seated at our table.As we were seated the waiter noticed I was wearing a black skirt and immediately switched my white napkin to a black one...A++++ on that alone! I started with a glass of Cabernet and they brought out the bread basket..man that thing is dangerous. I must have had a least 2 pieces of the pretzel bread with butter before we even ordered.   We all decided to order from the Restaurant Week menu it came with salad, filet, garlic mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and a choice of dessert. The presentation was awesome, several servers came out to our table and presented our steaks at the same time and served our sides to us as well. Mmmmmmm the steak was cooked just like I asked and it had this delish crust on the outside but then it was moist and juicy on the inside. And the garlic mashed potatoes were so rich, buttery, creamy and yummy I could have made a meal off of those alone. My friend's steak was undercooked and after not getting it quite right the 3rd time the manager came out and said he would take care of it for her. Great service!!! For dessert I went for the 5 layer chocolate cake, it was good not the best I've ever had but rich and chocolaty :-)   There was a rowdy bachelor party in our section that night, they even invited us over to take a shot and to congratulate the groom!   Since I don't have it like that yet this is definitely a special occasion place since it's pretty pricey. I will definitely be back to try the lobster mashed potatoes I saw on the menu!"}
{"text":"As we were leaving Mastro's, I told my husband to take a look around because I didn't think we'd be coming back soon. The vibe is nice but the food and service leave a lot to be desired. To their credit, the lobster bisque may well be the best I've had. After that, it all went downhill. I ordered medium rare and my waiter said that would be cold and red, and that if I wanted it warm and red, I should order medium. I took his advice and my filet was cooked through on the edges, pink in the center, and very dry. I should have stuck with my instincts. I don't think that would have done anything for the flavor, however. It was very under-seasoned. Same thing with the creamed spinach. No flavor. My husband had the porterhouse with the same experience. Also, the lounge act is ridiculous. It might be different when you are sitting in the  main dining room, but we were stuck in a \"cozy\" back room where the music was piped in and it was like listening to a wedding singer they paid with a groupon. For $50+ a plate, I think we can do much better."}
{"text":"Impeccable service! Our waiter, Bobby, was very nice and took great care of us.   When we were seated, we were one of only a couple tables. But as the (Monday) evening wore on we were swept up in a tide of patrons, talking and eating and enjoying the good life.   I had the petit filet, perfectly cooked and delivered on a sizzling plate. Others in my party had the Kansas City strip (deliciously marbled) and the 12oz bone in filet, which I did not try. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes, which were quite unique, and the sautéed spinach. Both sides were way too salty for my taste, and the potatoes were nearly molten after sitting on my hot plate for a minute. In hindsight I wish I had tried the sea bass, but if I had to choose steak again I would go with the KC filet.   The highlight of the night, even better than the steak if you ask me, was the cheesecake. It was divine, accompanied by what I think was fresh whipped cream and entirely unnecessary. The decaf coffee was \"meh.\"  I was not impressed by the entertainment either, a couple young women accompanied by what was essentially karaoke music. There should have been a pianist or something much classier.    The bill was astronomical but if you are going for experience, this is it."}
{"text":"Impeccable food, great vibe, and quality service. I went on a recommendation during my last vacation, and couldn't have been happier. It rates up there with the best steakhouses at which I've eaten. While it is pricey, anyone going in should know what they're getting into. A really great place!"}
{"text":"I'm really teeter toddling where to go with this review...  Do I review the restaurant?  Do I review the service?  Do I review the atmosphere?  Or do I simply review the entire experience?  This is a hard pressed 3 star review, because although our entire experience here was incredible (AKA Fiance's Parents took us here  for our engagement celebration) in all actuality that's really the best this location is REALLY worth.   First off Mastro's, your food is literally crack, and I mean literally. Your Lobster mashed potatoes, your steaks and your \"Why Thank you I'll be a fatass and order the butter cake\" dessert are AMAZING.   Here's why I'm taking two stars off you...  1. Your decor, although glowing neon red was cool in the 80's, having the bar illuminated with it reminds some of us of the movie \"Cocktail\" and that's not in a good way.   2. I shouldn't have to say this but, Scottsdale, you haven't changed.   So minus a star for all the backwards baseball hat wearing, rude, shouting, 30,000 dollar millionaires that jammed the dining room, also minus heavy points in my book for the guy wearing the cubic zirconium encrusted \"VERSCE\" sunglasses inside, (and yes, they were spelled that way too). Learn some class people...Jesus.    Although Mastro's is a fail safe, avoid this location and stick to Pinnacle Peak unless you want to be embarrassed by the locals in front of out of town guests."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in dinner!! My Mother in law and husband and I ate at Mastro's for Mother's Day expecting more than what we experienced. My cocktails were average/forgettable. My sea bass was flavorless and was so over priced!! Our server was not very helpful didn't provide recommendations, make small talk or wish us a Mother's Day. We spent over 300 dollars and the experience was extremely average. I was hoping for so much more and regret spending that much on this place. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a special occasion!! Someone called me days after asking about my experience and provided feedback. She informed me a manager will me calling me to discuss further and never did. This obviously shows they could careless about their customers. I was waiting for a response before I wrote a review."}
{"text":"I am \"dragged\" to this place at least once every 2 weeks by my \"dining partner\" who loves their steaks. Being the vegetarian that I am, I have never had one but I can find plenty on the menu to eat. ( I do eat fish).  First of all they have the best bread in town. I especially love the pretzel bread. Its hard to keep my hands out of that basket!  Since I am from Michigan, I was surprised to find Lake Superior Whitefish on the menu! My favorite fish! Just because of that they get 5 starts. I love the way they prepare it with the white wine, capers and butter! Yum yum! Basically all of their fish is fantastic but I do have to say for such a quality place, why do they have farm raised Salmon on the menu?? They often do have a \"special\" of Wild Alaskan though.  As far as the sides,I loved gnocchi and crab until I ate so much of it. Now my fav is the lobster mashed potato's....so decadent! They also have my \"favoritest\" dessert in town, the warm vanilla cake thing with strawberries. It is a must have and is tooooo die for! Well worth the calories!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for a milestone birthday dinner and they were fabulous! We wanted lively and sophisticated on a Monday night in Scottsdale. The piano bar totally fit the bill. The red lighting gave it a more modern flair. I am not into modern as much as my fiancé. He just loved the atmosphere. I enjoy more of a throwback to The Brown Derby. Now...onto the steak, sides, and cocktails! We ordered a 48 ounce porterhouse....whoaaaaa!! We mistakenly asked for rare plus rather than medium rare. Sent it back, and it came back PERFECT! My fiancé loved his peppercorn steak sauce, however, I liked it plain. We also had the huge onion rings and steamed spinach on the side. The onion rings were really awesome...same size as Fleming's with a little more grease and less breading. Totally fattening, but totally delicious! I probably would not pay $12 for a side of steamed spinach again. Best drink....the strawberry mule. The lemon ginger cocktail with the mint had too much mint and not enough ginger. Did not taste the ginger. Ginger lovers beware! We loved Mastro's and Kerel was a top notch waiter....keep him around, Mastro's!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow! This place is amazing! Our server was sweet and was very helpful when it came to the wine section of the menu and also helping us find a juicy steak, I wish I could afford to come here more often!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great wine, good live music. Opulent bar, good crowd, excellent service.  A+, would recommend. Rib eye was massive."}
{"text":"I have always loved going to Mastro's for dinner.  I moved from AZ to CO 6 years ago and missed what I believed to be one of the best steak houses in Scottsdale.  I was excited when we planned to spend NYE in Scottsdale and made reservations at Mastro's for dinner.  The King Crab legs did not taste fresh. The scalloped potatoes were inedible. The only plus was the filet.  I understand the hostesses were dealing with an extremely busy NYE crowd but they did not great guests politely they were very rude. Our server checked on our table once briefly after our food was served.  If the server had returned to the table perhaps something could have been done to turn around what was a disastrous dinner. If we return for the Phoenix Open or Spring Training I will not be returning to what was once my favorite restaurants.   Caution diners Mastro's is pricey and disappointing meals should never occur.  :("}
{"text":"Other reviews are spot on. This place is great! From the moment we walked in we were welcomed and given excellent attention. Setting is dark and cool, lots of waiters bustling around, place was packed with happy customers. Had a delicious strawberry martini, the filet came sizzling to our table, and omg the lobster mashed potatoes. Well worth the price. And of course, the butter cake. Insane! Meal was in my top 5 favorites. Will definitely be back. Kicked Ruth Chris' ass for sure!"}
{"text":"came here the other day to celebrate my birthday and had another great experience, at another Mastro's Steakhouse.  having had my birthday dinner at the Vegas Mastro's the year before, i knew the bar was set high, and Scottsdale did not let down!  first off...wine selection...one of the best...period.  steaks. amazing. the kansas cut...perfectly charred on the outside...bleeding red and juicy on the inside...chewy but still tender...tasting of meat and butter...my favorite cut of steak to grub on...  also had the stone crab claws for the first time...i had an inkling that these bad boys were overpriced (15 bucks for 1 is insane) but damnit, it tasted amazing...served up with a nose clearing horseradish and some other creamy sauce...it was a sweet flaky piece of seafood that i thoroughly enjoyed...  ordered up a iceberg wedge salad with plenty of chunky blue cheese and bacon AND also ordered up the lobster bisque...creamy, rich, lobster flavored bisque with heavy chunks of lobster sitting at the bottom of the bowl...amazing.  last but not least. truffle gnocchi. by the time this came out with my steak, i was completely stuffed...and BOY is the truffle gnocchi rich...bursting with black truffle flavor, this dish is borderline \"too much\" for my palate...it didnt help that i was already at capacity when i started eating this as well...next time...no appetizers and no bread before the meal!!!  service was very good.  cost...expensive BUT well worth it...not to mention i got a \"HIGH ROLLER\" badge from Yelp with my check in there!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for special occasions. They make the whole dining experience a grand performance down to every little detail. Amazing cuisine and the butter cake for desert is a must try - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Mastro's and Ocean Club, had high hopes for this venue.  The food was good... but not great.  The service was excellent. However, the ambience left much to be desired. Cramped and loud. Now, to be fair, this might be more a factor of the clientele than the venue, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Is it a steakhouse or a singles bar?  With the music blasting out of the bar area, it is difficult to tell.  There are steak options every few blocks here in the Valley of the Sun, so skip this one and go to any of the other fine options."}
{"text":"This isn't the type of place that I could afford to eat at once a week, but there can't be a better place to go for a celebratory meal or special occasion.   A group of friends and family and I went here, and I gotta say it lived up to it's reputation. I expected a snooty server, but the one that came to the table was actually really cool. We started with an amazing tower of seafood appetizer complete with fist sized shrimp and lobster claws.   Then there was the steak. Every single cut sounded delicious, but one stood out for me... the twelve ounce bone-in Filet Mignon. It was like a little slice of heaven. Perfectly prepared and excellently presented, it could've been cut with a spoon. The sides were served family style and were also very good (asparagus and lobster mashed potatoes). The server explained the cooking process and everything about how they obtain and prepare the meat, which was very cool.   This was one of the classiest restaurants I've ever been to and I hope I get to go back soon..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great atmosphere. My ribeye came out over cooked and they comped it. Ordered it medium and it came out well.  Price is high to eat here but check it out and you will see why. I'll be back next time I feel for great steak and seafood."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with my husband. We were excited we have been to Morton's and loved it so since they are owned by the same company we thought great let's try it... The restaurant itself was nice dimmed lighting, piano player, just a nice atmosphere. I didn't really care for the bread personal choice I prefer hot bread and butter. This bread was harder and crunchy my husband loved it. We both ordered Rib Eye mine medium rare his medium well. I ordered a baked potato and he ordered the mashed potato's. Neither steak had any flavor sad but true... :/ they were both cooked as we requested though. The baked potato was big and and all the toppings served on the side which I liked. The mashed potatoes were very flavorful and good. Over all it was a nice evening out but I've had a better steak at Long Horns which we love."}
{"text":"It kills me to give such a low rating to a Mastro's Steakhouse...  I've been to most of the Mastro's around the country, and the food at the Scottsdale location does not disappoint. The factor that DID disappoint was their hostess staff. Here's a quick summery of what occured:  I called early in the day to make reservations, was informed that 9:30pm was the earliest for that evening. No problem, it was a last minute reservation, I could understand. We show up around 8:45 to try and grab drinks at the bar (was overcrowded so decided against that), I checked in with the hostess just to inform her that we were there. She rudely snapped at me saying that they were behind, and that they might be caught up by my reservation time. Again, no problem, I wasn't expecting to be seated early. We waited patiently in the front lobby, along with other groups of guests...9:30 came and went....10:00 came and went. At 10:15pm, I begin to notice that there were groups who arrived after us who were being seated. I approach the hostess and ask when we might be able to get our 9:30 reservation, and she starts yelling saying that they were busy. By 10:30, we are the only people left standing in the lobby. So I again ask if we were going to be seated, especially since everyone who arrived after us was already seated at this point. She starts yelling, again, saying that it is impossible that they would seat anyone who arrived after us. I turned around and pointed out that there was no one left in the lobby...except us...where did they all go if they weren't seated? Surely we were not the last people to arrive on a Saturday night...since we arrived 1hr 45min ago. She proceeded to rudely call another hostess over and said \"fine, seat them,\" and rolls her eyes at me. Thanks Alexis...for a night I will never forget.   Low and behold, once we were seated, there were plenty of empty tables. Anyways, that was the end of the horrible part of the evening. Many thanks to our wonderful server, Bobby, who picked up on the vibe that we were upset and really made our dining experience enjoyable. Gratitude to the GM as well, who personally came to apologize for the long wait. Those two individuals were the reason I gave this Mastro's 3-stars...one star for each of them and one for the ever-delicious food. (Recommendations: Shrimp cocktail appetizer, bone-in ribeye, butter cake desert)  I really hope that the hostess staff was just having a bad day and that they don't normally treat their patrons like the way they did that evening.   Will I eat at a Mastro's again? You bet... Will I ever eat at the Mastro's in Scottsdale? Never again"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with reservations here for our anniversary.   This place knows how to make steak.  Had the bone in fillet and it was cooked perfectly. The sides were amazing and the atmosphere was perfect  We sat near the piano and the guys playing were amazing!  It was the perfect night."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is always excellent and the service timely and friendly.  Prices are reasonable considering the quality, but some may disagree.    I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"The people here have everything down pat. From reservations to after dinner drinks, all was perfect.  Steaks are excellent. As is the Shrimp Cocktail and the sides. They have the best breadbasket in town."}
{"text":"Don't eat here just because the meat is some of the best we have ever had. Eat here because the staff and service are terrific. Manager, Jes Maverick Smith went out of his way to make our evening memorable. Our server Andrew couldn't have been better. We and our friends will definitely be back for both the food and the service."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Arizona. Amazing service, awesome decor, and the best food one can possibly get. Drinks are fantastic as well. You will never leave City Hall unsatisfied."}
{"text":"First and foremost I would like to give a huge thank you to the staff for being so accommodating. Everyone was warm and friendly, we came two days in a row & our waitress remembered everything we had the day before.  The decor was beautiful & the ambiance was perfect.  ... Now for the fun stuff,   Appetizer| I highly recommend, the Dungeness crab & shrimp tower as an appetizer. The crab cakes and lobsters are also phenomenal .    Entree| The steaks & lamb chops were bar none- cooked and season to perfection.  We came back the next night and had the blackened salmon which was perfectly season and tender.    Dessert| You MUST try the warm butter cake. You will not be disappointed! T The chocolate cake cake was good, no complaints.    All in all, I had a perfect experience! Thanks Mastro's"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying visits to City Hall since Mark Drinkwater was a regular; he bought me chocolate covered strawberries once when he was plowed.  The name may have changed, but the fun times and excellent Belvedere Martinis have not - so I keep coming back!  I've celebrated 3 birthdays here, multiple break-ups, a new job, and several bonuses.  It's the place I discovered that rare plus was the best way to order a filet and the exquisite joy of sugar snap peas done right.   I've come here in shorts and I've come here in an evening gown. Either way, I'm always treated like an important customer and they've never gotten my martini wrong.  What more do you need to know?"}
{"text":"Not that Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse needs another five star rating, but here it is anyway.  I made reservations on line about 2pm for 7:45pm on Saturday and was immediately taken to our table.  It was in the bar section, which initially I thought might be a problem because of noise, but soon decided it added to the overall dining experience as a three piece band played great tunes on an off during our meal. And, we were going to go and listen to music after dining anyway.  We started with cocktails (they're HUGE), but as soon as my girlfriend's mojito arrived she pushed it back as being laden with soda water.  We asked it be remade with 7-Up and the waiter quickly complied.  The menu was extensive and offered numerous temptations, but we both easily decided on the crab cakes (everything they're built up to be on earlier reviews) and filet's.  Probably the best I've ever tasted.  And the au'graten potatoes and creamed spinach were excellent compliments.  No room for desert, but maybe next time.  And there will definitely be many \"next time's\".  Great food.  Great service. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything Mastro's is always five stars in my book. Perhaps probably one of my favorite restaurants Mastro's City Hall is always memorable. I hadn't been in a while so when tasked with picking a dinner spot this was an obvious choice. If I'm being completely honest, I lost a bet so I had to foot the bill for a night out. I prefer to sit in the bar area since it has a younger, cooler vibe but I've sat in the main dining area as well it's just a little uptight for me sometimes.   Of course, the wine selection is incredible and the cocktails are expertly crafted. The Mastro's Classic Martini is a must and you have to get the blue cheese stuffed olives. I would also recommend the Elderflower martini {Belvedere citrus vodka | Hendricks Gin | Thatchers elderflower liqueur | fresh lemon juice}   I can never decide on just one appetizer so we got the beef carpaccio and the sautéed sea scallops. The scallops came out first and were huge and cooked perfectly tender without being chewy. They were sautéed in what I can only assume was butter made by Jesus himself it was that heavenly! The carpaccio was ENORMOUS! The accompanying arugula salad with shaved Parmesan and capers is the stuff dreams are made of.   For my main entrée I ordered the twin lobster tails. In true Mastro's fashion they came back to the table to explain that their shipment of lobsters were a little on the skimpy side so I would instead be getting quadruplet lobster tails. I of course was fine with that. When they came out it was four normal size lobster tails and they were all amazing! I love how accommodating our server was to the whole experience and especially whenever he deshelled  my lobsters for me without even me even asking.  If for some reason you haven't been here I highly recommend it! Whether it's for a birthday or anniversary City Hall will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  This is our celebration place.  Love the foaming Cosmo, the shrimp cocktail and the pretzel bread.  No celebration is complete without the butter cake dessert, always customized for the occasion.  Alicia did a fantastic job tonight.  And the lobster was to die for"}
{"text":"Great place! Quality! Quantity! Best steak my brother John and I have had in years!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is AWESOME!!!! This is another place you'll go and feel like you're in one of the great Steak houses of New York or Chicago. There is enough variety of seafood and meat dishes on the mwnu to satisfy even the most particular palate.  This all comes at a price, as Mastro's takes the a la carte concept to a new level. You will pay additional for any side-unless a sizzling hot dish (DON'T TOUCH-YOU WILL BURN YOURSELF) of meat, with NOTHING else is all you crave.  That being said, the sides are more than generous with each side being plenty for up to three or four people.  You would be hard pressed to find a more tender or succulent piece of filey anywhere in town. The service is good, the atmosphere nice and fancy. There is a decent three person band providing entertainment, and more than one Scottsdale Cougar was cutting a rug.  This is really a fancy, top-dining spot. Classy atmosphere, great food good service. You could not go wrong here if you're in the mood to splurge on dinner. You will want to undo your belt a knotch or two though before you leave as you will be full!"}
{"text":"The management was promptly in touch and  made a concerted effort to ameliorate our negative last impression. The follow up experience was good, as can be expected and up to the usual Mastro's standard."}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab a steak in the greater Phoenix area. Service is top notch and food is spectacular. Only downside is that the menu is pretty stagnant. Typically nothing crazy in terms of specials, but what does it matter, you're going to get your favorite steak anyway.  Food:  Crab Cakes and Tuna Tartare are awesome for appetizers. Can't go wrong with either one.  Seafood Towers- They will make you a custom seafood tower with whatever chilled seafood you want on it. These are pretty expensive, but are really awesome if you don't mind ponying up the cash. Crab claws are pre-cracked and prepared so that the entire claw of meat comes out in one piece with zero effort. Have had shrimp, oysters, and king crab with the tower before and they are all great. Have dry ice steaming out of the top for a pretty cool presentation.  Steaks- I almost always get the bone-in filet. They cook their steaks exactly how you want them and are seasoned perfectly.  Sides- Lobster mashed potatoes, Black truffle gnocchi, and the mushrooms are all favorites. At this place, I highly doubt anything is sub-par.  MOST IMPORTANT --- Dessert- Get the butter cake. I don't care if you don't like cake, butter, sugar, or just dessert in general. It doesn't matter. It's the best dessert on the planet. I could honestly go just for this.   Overall, this is my favorite place to go to for a nice romantic dinner. Their service is over the top excellent. I have been here over a dozen times. The only time that I had a mildly bad experience (steak came out very undercooked) the general manager comped the steak and sent me a gift card to come back and have dinner for two on him. I believe his name was Jester. I really appreciated that. City Hall will have my business for life. Don't know how I didn't mention this until the end, but the have really excellent bartenders and make some of the best martinis and manhattans in town."}
{"text":"Great attendant, my water glass never went below half full. Waiter was very long winded explaining the restaurant and specials.   Steak was very tasty, very tender cut and was prepared medium rare as ordered, very flavorful and juicy. The rest of the sides were nothing special or memorable."}
{"text":"Even without my review you know that this place is very good.  All of the steaks and sides are excellent.  How can you go wrong with a bone-in rib eye?  I've also recently become a big fan of their dirty martinis.  Well-made with plenty of extra left in the shaker for a 1 1/2 sized cocktail.  Make sure you get the butter cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Three words: Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Every time I eat here we absolutely MUST have this! Steaks are always perfection, service is of course top notch! My absolute favorite steakhouse in the Valley.  Perfect for date night, anniversary, birthday, etc."}
{"text":"BONE IN!   Hands down, the best steak around.   Get an order of sauteed mushrooms to go with it, you won't be sorry.   The bar high tops are a great place to eat if you're not looking for the sit down experience.  The dining area is very nice, but I have a hard time being sat back there when I'm with my buddy looking for a stellar piece of meat and a stiff cocktail.  The service is great and Thurs - Sat evenings will host a good crowd in the bar.  The live music is a great touch too.    Two words...Bone In.  Make it happen.  Period."}
{"text":"What a shame... the service, food taste and quality was world class.  We are still talking about how great everything tasted.   1 star is for the ridiculous 3% surcharge just started this past week.  6 of us ordered seafood tower, house salad, ribeye, NY steaks, lobster mash, Gorgonzola Mac, asparagus, 2 or 3 rounds of cocktails, then topped off with butter cakes. Hard to believe that the $800 was not enough and management found it necessary to add another 3% surcharge.  There is no mention of this until you receive your bill.  Ask your server about this and the manager will be brought to your table to point out the disclaimer on your bill. Not right!"}
{"text":"the filet was perfect. and i highly suggest the hennesy sidecar. just as perfect as the steak."}
{"text":"A group of us went and it was the same as my previous visits overall.   The service is great.   The place looks elegant.   My only complaint with the ambience was a tipsy woman at a table very close to me laughing loudly right in my ear for long stretches.   The place is noisy on busy nights.   Tables are closer together than expected for an establishment that holds itself out as the ultimate in fine dining.    Between the five of us,  we had steak,  sea bass,  pork and several sides and appetizers.   It was all tasty but no \"wow\" factor in any of our dishes.   A nice place to go,  but none of it in line with its prices."}
{"text":"Went online to order several gift cards as x-mas gifts on December 15..never received the gift cards so I had to go out and spend another $250..called their gift card line and was forced to leave a message 3 times and never received a return call..this is the worst customer service ever!!  Will not be giving them my business anytime in the near futur"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Delicious food and great atmosphere! Very Pricy but  WORTH it!  This place is a great treat and has a fabulous atmosphere. The lobster mash potatoes were mouth watering as were the steaks!"}
{"text":"Wow! It's been a long time since I've given any restaurant a 10 but Mastro's City Hall is right on. Hostesses greeted us cordially and we were seated at once. We loved the 'feel' of the restaurant and that there were no young children. Our server, Corelle (sp?) was beyond excellent. They have a great 'by the glass' wine list. Our steaks were sizzling on the plates. Coffee and water were refreshed quietly and a delish dessert was presented to us to celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary. This dinner will be a part of that memory for years to come. (one suggestion: the valet area is a little dark and makes for uncertainty in spiked heels.)"}
{"text":"great atmosphere with a very well managed staff. Menu is totally on point, so its hard to make recommendations when everything is executed perfectly. Cant go wrong with any cut of beef or the lobster mac and cheese.   Id just like to see a little more diversity on the menu."}
{"text":"This is just a great place to go for special occasions.  We had the filet mignon and the strip steak and both were just lovely.  I'd give both a 5/5.  The service was amazing and we've dined in both the piano room and the main dining area.  Honestly, we loved the piano room better as the songs added to the atmosphere and the main dining area was a bit loud to converse.  If there were any criticisms, it would be that their butter cake desert was a bit over hyped.  Personally, I prefer the butter cake at Frasher's steakhouse better but that's quibbling over minor points.  Come here, drop a ton of money, and leave feeling like Rip Van Winkle was short changed."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was completely overshadowed by the rudeness of the staff. They acted as if they were completely put out that we were at their restaurant. No food is good enough to have staff be completely snobbish and rude. Epic fail"}
{"text":"Looking for an incredible steakhouse in AZ and not concerned about the damage you'll do to your wallet?  City Hall is the way to go!  I've been to City Hall more than a handful of times through the years as well as it's sister concepts: Ocean Club and Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  You cannot go wrong with any of them.  I just happen to prefer City Hall because of the convenient location to where I live and work!  I've been to meet a friend or two for happy hour at the bar, I've been for a bachelorette party, and I often go for celebratory date nights with my husband... as we did on this past Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday!  If you're up for a bit of a scene, some live music and great people watching, I highly recommend sitting in the bar.  Let me reiterate: this is a high end steakhouse.  Expect to valet your car and bring cash for the bathroom attendant as well.  But you get what you pay for.  Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.  Starting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.  In addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.  Next up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!  And for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.  Both arrive on Mastro's signature hot plates, and they've always been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Pair 'em with your favorite sides - you really can't go wrong here although my top picks would be sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, and grilled asparagus.  I've never heard anyone complain about the signature lobster mashed potatoes either.  By now, you're definitely full, but keep drinking or hanging out digesting until you make room for dessert.  Don't miss the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Thank me later!  You can't go wrong with the Key Lime Pie or Cheesecake either, but again, that butter cake is to die for!  On my recent birthday visit, I enjoyed many of the items mentioned above except for the dirty martini and oysters... I'm prego at the moment, so sadly, I had to pass on both.  But after this baby comes, I can't wait to go back for another incredible meal.  Who wants to join me?!"}
{"text":"The food and service were an A+.  The noise level and proximity of the tables made it impossible to hear or enjoy any sort of conversation.  The tables on either side of us spoke VERY loud in order to hear each other which meant that we ALL heard their conversations.  The tables were so close too that if people from the tables on either side of us got up, things were knocked over on our table. For the amount of money you are putting out for this food, it would be great if the atmosphere was a bit better."}
{"text":"I have been bringing clients and friends to your restaurants for years and had nothing but stellar results.....until last night.  I am very disappointed (as well as embarrassed) by the way the evening unfolded.  Yes it was a crazy night, but it was a Saturday night in December and anyone with anytime in the restaurant industry knows what that means.  The management at the City Hall in Scottsdale should be ashamed.   It all started with our reservations for 8 (under my coworkers name Kanouse) set for 7:30.  After standing at the front door for 45 minutes, we were finally seated at 8:15.  The evening continued to go downhill from there.  It started with several of the cocktails arriving incorrect.  Multiple requests for additional bread were made to several staff (including a manager) and never materialized (this became more important given the fact that our entrees did not arrive until 10:15, 2 HOURS after being seated).  Several guests in my party ordered the 28 oz Prime Rib, the \"special\" of the evening, only to be told an hour after ordering it that they \"were out\" of the offering, this occuring relatively early on a Saturday evening.  Multiple times we waited there for quite some time with empty glasses waiting for someone to either fill them or take our order for another coctail.  A seafood tower arrived with considerably less on it than the usual orders I am accustomed to.  And to top it all off, several of my guests ordered the \"recommended\" key lime pie, only to be informed 20 minutes later that it too, like the special prime rib, was no longer available.  I'm sorry but you would think that for a dinner for 8 costing $1,300 (including tip), a little better evening could have been expected.  I am very well aware that the Mastro's restaurants are capapble of providing a first class evening, but on this particular eveing the ball was definitely dropped.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.

{"text":"This is where it's at.  Guys... the definition of \"wine and dine\"... yes go here!  I believe it is now called \"Drinkwaters\"... but it's still one of the mastro's so I don't care what they call it, this place is awesome!!!  The steak comes sizzling on the plate, you can smell it from across the room.  Fancy, classy, but still laid back... you can wear your cutest pair of jeans :)  Cool atmosphere with some live music, a busy bar, fireplace, and then a white tablecloth, service at it's best, low-light dining room.  Perfect date spot if you want to spend a penny or two and really impress her.   The seafood tower is TO DIE FOR.  You have to order a steak for your main course and the warm butter cake is the perfect finale.  Oh City Hall... I dream of you often.........."}
{"text":"The best rib eye I've ever had. Bread, apps and sides were amazing too.  P.S.  order the butter cake."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to dislike this place. I don't have much experience with upscale restaurants like this. The food was great, service was great, nice atmosphere. My biggest issue was I specifically came here for the lobster and they only offered a four pound lobster. As you can guess a four pound lobster here is not cheap, isn't much less than my car payment. Don't come here if you're on a budget."}

Our service was not that great and their prices are very high$$$$!!!!!The food was unbelievable the seafood towers we ordered , appetizers, and I really really enjoyed my bone in ribeye:)was to perfection with taste!!! Music was awesome and our drinks were taking a long time to come! the bar was overcrowded and bartenders were behind:("}
{"text":"Amazzzzzing!!!!! Very fancy and expensive but totally worth it if you want to splurge. The wedge salad and butter cake are my favorite."}
{"text":"Group of 8, business dinner...terrible service, sent 2 of 7 steaks back and 1 never showed back up. Everyone finished, still waiting on the last steak and sides !  Walked out..."}
{"text":"Make reservations if you want to be in bar .  Steaks are spot on, cooked perfect-apps a little questionable, over priced for the quality. Desert- I had key lime pie, homemade crust- delicious.   Service has been hit or miss in bar.    We split everything & still left full as could be."}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great.  Food was good as it usually is.  For the price you would think they would take care of everything.  Went there for my birthday.  The messed up my cake order.  Manager came over and apologized briefly and said he would call me personally the next morning.  Never got a call!  Talk about pathetic!  Not interested in ever going back after that last experience!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the entire visit! From the initial greeting, to our seating, feeding, and leaving. It was a wonderful place to hold an intimate celebration for yours truly. Plus, the wine list is amazing and well priced. Shhh.   Our hostess was a lifesaver that evening. Although we had reservations, the allocated table wasn't going to work for a  6' 2\" boy in his prime fighting weight. Without hesitation the words \"no problem\" was music to my ears. After being reseated, Giuseppe our excellent waiter was at the helm. He was attentive and made sure our visit was remarkable. And it was!   We began with a bottle of 2010 Margaux wine along with Foie Gras and Beef Carpaccio. The portions were quite large on both counts. Delicious and well plated.  The Foie Gras had a perfect texture and wonderful reduction sauce.  Carpaccio was fresh and plentiful(see photo) I love that they place a generous amount of arugula, capers and cheese; makes for a superb appetizer!   We ordered a Wedge Iceberg salad and Giuseppe split this for us without asking! How cool is that?!  The Wagyu Tomahawk 40oz was the hit of the evening. The aroma and tenderness upon the first bite, hooks you into heaven. Although large and plenty for two, next time I'm getting my own. That's a testament of how scrumptious and well seasoned it was!   Asparagus were a bit weak but we still ate and enjoyed them. All together, the savory part of the meal was spectacular.  Which leads us to a beautifully arranged dessert. (Please see photo) I was very grateful to Mastro's for my Birthday dessert as the fluffiness and taste of the cake made for a perfect ice cream accompaniment. And...whipped cream on top! Delicious!!  It all made for a great evening and a place for us to return as regulars and not just for special occasions. The atmosphere, service, and excellent price point is fabulous, begging for return visits.  Valet parking right in front is super convenient and courteous.  Try for yourself and see what you think. Thanks for reading. =)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service needs improvement across the board. Lack of attention to detail made it a two star visit. Kitchen is obviously doing a good job.   I ate there on Friday night with a golfing buddy and had cocktails, salads, steaks, a few sides and a bottle of wine. Spent ~$300. The drink person messed up my buddy's drink. A lemon twist is not a lime last time I checked. (Strike one).  The waitress needs \"say it, don't spray it\" advice. We can't be the only ones she spat on while talking to us...likely because a crappy band was playing in the bar and she had to talk too loud. (Strike two). And then I get a note from opentable saying I was a no-show for my reservation. (Strike three).   Advice: two ears and one mouth for a reason, Mastros. And, PLEASE don't take drinks away if they aren't finished and please don't pour the wine as fast as you can to make me ask you if you are in a hurry.   Good food deserves better service. Fix it."}
{"text":"My husband and I only go on special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays due to the cost. But it is sooooo worth it. And my favorite part of the meal the butter cake. The best dessert I have ever had. Save room and big enough for 2 to share! The steaks are always good and if your not happy with anything let them know and they will gladly fix it. Lobster Mashed potatoes are good but not worth the cost."}
{"text":"To start off with appetizers! The scallops are to die for with the thick tomato sauce. It is served with cheese focassia bread.  We also had the shrimp cocktail. They came out thick and cold with a crisp and sharp sauce that gave it a good crunch with each bite.   For dinner you can't go wrong with the filet. It melts like butter in your mouth. I order it medium rare so the flavor stays in the steak and when cut, the juices leak out the sides."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and professionalism by staff. The food is to die for... Great place for apps,dinner or dessert. Have the pound cake (:"}
{"text":"I say best steak in Arizona until someone can demonstrate otherwise.  Bone-in filet is the best steak there. Trust me, we ordered all of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I were fortunate enough to come here with a hefty gift card from his bosses. We both tend to watch what we spend, so it was nice to have the freedom to order things we normally might not have. If I judge our meal through the \"I didn't pay for it\" lens, I would give Mastro's four stars.   However, having been to other high-end steakhouses like Donovan's, Capital Grille etc. I'm not sure I would rate Mastro's quite as high. While the steak I had was fairly good, it didn't come close to the quality and flavor I've had elsewhere. The same could be said for the side dishes (scalloped potatoes and brussels sprouts) - fairly good, but I've had better. When the waiter asked if I wanted truffle butter on my steak, the answer was \"Sure!\" Again, because I had a gift card. I was shocked to see on the bill that a pat of butter was $15!! I know truffles are expensive, but damn! Lastly, we went for a butter cake to share. I found it to be mediocre compared to (yeah, I have kids and I'm going to actually say this!) California Pizza Kitchen's.  I guess what I'm trying to say here is that if I'd visited without a gift card to splurge with, I might not choose to come back. Yes, the food is good and the service is attentive. I just think you can get better quality meals for less around the valley, even at a comparable high-end steakhouse like Donovan's."}
{"text":"What people see in this place....is beyond me.  I always feel like I should become a steak connoisseur.  The ambiance of this establishment is on point which is probably the only reason ill give them two stars along with the decent customer service with how big our party was.  Food wise though wont get any besides the lobster bisque that was decent as well.  I had ordered the porterhouse which was overly salted for whatever reason and I love salt but not like a salt lick kind of a taste to my steak.  I almost wish they would have let me season my own steak and cook it myself.  The brussel sprouts were even overly salted I was so bummed because I Love brussel sprouts and I love steak  but both being as salty as they were quickly made me want to stop eating and throw up.  My boyfriends rib eye was so much more tender than my steak I was severely upset with my choice.  He said his was just okay definitely not worth what they priced it at and hated his creamed corn that he took a couple bites and pushed the rest away.    I can tell you right now that this will definitely be the first and last time we would be dining with them for sure."}
{"text":"I had amazing service and the food was outstanding. Highly recommend the sea food tower with caviar!"}
{"text":"Entering through large glass motif front doors, our hospital Medical Executive party of five and our medical staff lawyer were greeted by a number of well-dressed hostesses. One immediately notices how dark the bar and restaurant are.  Too dark for me.  The majority of the patrons were noted to be using their cell phones to read the menu. The menu is typical steakhouse with choices of steaks and seafood options. The appetizers were also very typical for a high end steakhouse: including tuna tartare, seared ahi, jumbo shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and shoe-string potatoes. The seating area including the tables, chairs and utensils are very upscale and remind you that you're in a fine dining establishment. The waiter, an assistant and the bus boy greet you politely and introduce themselves by first name. They have an extensive wine list as well as various bottled water options. We started off with the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous, slightly sweet, and came with horseradish, and cocktail sauce. They were presented over a bed of dry ice making for a very pleasant presentation. The tuna tartare comes out on stacked wonton chips and I believe microgreens.  It was OK. Nothing spectacular. The crab cakes were awful. The crust was extremely tough and peeled off the rest of the cake.  A knife was needed to cut it.  Flavor was nothing special.   For the entrée, I opted for the 8 ounce filet, along with their shoestring potatoes, and steamed broccoli.   In between appetizer and the main meal, they made sure to refresh the table, not leaving a single crumb on the table cloth. An additional nice touch, the waiter informed us at certain intervals about how long our main meals would arrive.  On a slightly negative note, we made sure to ask the waiter not to stack our appetizers along with the main meal, and he seemed to take some offense to that. Unfortunately, rushing the appetizer's and quickly bringing the main meal has been a fairly regular occurrence at a lot of the restaurants in Scottsdale.   The filet came out perfectly cooked medium rare, but had a very rubbery texture which I did not find appealing. It was not melting your mouth delicious but was fairly good. I was expecting a much stronger signature steak product. The steamed broccoli was just that,  steamed broccoli. The shoe string fries were very good. The portion was very generous and not too salted. We also order the mashed potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese. The steak plates came out extremely hot, as they should. However when the macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes were scooped on our plates, they begin to sizzle and became somewhat melted and runny. Not much you can do about that.   Service was very very attentive and our drinks filled no more than half a dozen times. Our used dishes were removed and fresh forks and knives were replaced as needed in a nonintrusive fusion.    I happened to be there for a business meeting along with five other people. I did notice that most of the people there appeared to be work colleagues, not families or couples.    Definitely worth the rating for service, ambience but not overly impressed with the signature steak product."}
{"text":"Missed opportunity.  During restaurant week you have a chance to grow your business. Why not collect comment cards and ask for e mail s? Why not give a little more and at the end of the meal offer to book the next visit?  The managers in this town have no idea how to drive business. They missed every opportunity. The waiters act like your crappola if you order of the featured menu. We didn't even know that  this restaurant was participating. We came in blind.  The minute we decided to order from the restaurant week menu we never saw our server again he was not interested. We spend a fortune wining and dining. Nice work."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place!! The chocolate martinis are the best around. You can't go wrong on anything you order there. It's expensive but oh so worth it! The lobster Mac n cheese is awesome! They have an excellent New Years Eve party!"}
{"text":"I've been to many mastro's and typically leave happy.  I had the bone in filet which was mediocre/good and for the price charged that just isnt acceptable.  Crab cakes were tasty but not as good as another restaurant in town that were amazing (eddie v's)!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had every time I've had it!  Steaks are prepared to perfection and the sides could give you an erection ! Lol. The Butter cake to finish is amazing and a must have!"}
{"text":"This is our to go place for any special occasion. The food and service are always perfect. My husband is a huge steak lover and has not been disappointed by the bone in rib eye, orders it every time.   Don't hate me, but I am not a steak eater....that being said I love Mastros Sea Bass. It literally is the best thing I've ever tasted. Also, like many others, we never skip the butter cake."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite steak & chop house in AZ! The filet mignon, chop salad, & Vesper martini, I'm set. The Vesper alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Always a tradition for u on birthdays to come here.....the food is terrific, and the service always very good...we will keep coming here year after year....one negative this time is we asked if our filet we were splitting could be served oscar style......the charge for this we saw at the end was $26, so we will never ask for that again."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite steak house in all of Arizona. It is definitely a bit hoity toity, and high class but the food and service is unbeatable. Last weekend when I went there I got the 6 oz filet, my girlfriend got the Chilean sea bass, and we got 3 sides which were the mushrooms, crab gnocchi, and snap peas. The steak was perfectly done medium with a little char on the outside just like I like it; and I ordered truffle butter on top (weirded out by saying that thanks to that one song). I tasted my girlfriends Chilean Seabass and it was crispy on the outside but tasted like butter on the inside; which is exactly how Chilean Seabass should be. Now for the sides, they were all delicious but the snap peas here are the best because they are crispy on the outside and not too chewy, but I am pretty sure it's because of the loads of butter that they use when cooking them. Oh and also we got two appetizers, the calamari which was delicious and then the tuna jalapeño sashimi which tasted amazing but had a huge downside...    Now for the downsides...They give you chopsticks to eat the sashimi with and anyone who has ever eaten sashimi knows you can't eat it with a fork so chop sticks are appropriate, now the down side of these chop sticks is that they are plastic and super slippery.. Yeah it was pretty much impossible to pick up the sashimi because with the oil and sauce they use the sashimi slips right through the chopsticks.. We had to literally move the sashimi to the side of the plate where it was hanging off to the side and then pick it up with the chopsticks and naturally some pieces fell off and eventually we just sort of gave up on it so please if you are reading this change to crappy old wooden chop sticks. Another downside is the price... I mean this place is ridiculously expensive, the cheapest bottle of wine was $100!! We got the cherry pie Pinot Noir and it was $135 despite being $15-20 at the store. And when I ordered all of this for two people my bill ended up being like $450 for two people... I would say a bit expensive. So change the chop sticks and you will get a 5 star, maybe make it a bit cheaper but I understand the service is amazing and so is the food so I can't really blame them for that."}
{"text":"I would put this up against the best steak in NY.  Wolfgang's in NY still gets my top place but Mastro's City Hall is great.    Incredible steak and sides.  I had the bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly.  Great cut of meat.  Also had a tremendous bowl of delicious lobster mashed potatos.    Beware of all the butter though...there is plenty of it!  Entertainment in the lounge area is great too.  Not your typical lounge singer but a guy playing the guitar along with a pianist will entertain you all night with Top 40 hits in a lounge singer fashion."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd Mastro's I've been to in the city.  My 1st experience was with their Pinnacle Peak location.  I was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up.....and yes it did!  We joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.    Of course, I had to order my fav dishes here:  Wedge Salad Bone-In Filet Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese  The food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.  The service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.  Tip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.  Can't wait for the next time!  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Sorry, folks. No Malibu Rum here. I stay sober and enjoy the food when heading to City Hall.   Filet? Yes, please :) Oh, and the joy of the lobster mashed potatoes, the chocolate cake and bread basket with pretzel bread. Can you say carb overload?? You'll definitely need a good workout after dining here :)    Bar wait staff is okay at best but restaurant staff is excellent. And live music at the piano bar is nice. Although it can get a bit too loud at times in the bar and you can't hear the person next to you. Also, watch out for the Trouts, gals. Some can be pretty creepy!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, this place is awesome!!!!  I had the filet medium rare and it was one of the best filets I've had. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes are a must. It was my favorite part of the meal. Huge chunks of lobster and creamy mashed potatoes. The creme corn was good as well, but I would go there just for the lobster mashed potatoes. If you don't try the lobster mashed potatoes, you are missing out on the entire experience of Mastro's.  As for dessert, the warm butter cake is amazing. I would recommend this or the creme brulee.   Warning, you will most likely feel like your stomach is about to explode when leaving there.  On a last note, get the lobster mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I finally got a yelp account so I decided to write reviews for all my favorite restaurants and Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse is definitely on my list. I have gone there for my friend's bday (and because it was so good) went back for my bday and my husband's bday. The restaurant has both a quiet dining room and a loud fun bar / lounge area with a live band. Each time I've gone, I sat in the bar and had Johnny as my server. He has made our dining experience even better by giving great recommendations on both food & drinks (and wine)...it was like he could read us perfectly. I highly recommend City Hall and if you go ask for Johnny, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think I had really high expectations because this place was rated #1 on Yelp and I read in magazines that this was the best steakhouse in AZ.  The place is kind of located on the outskirts of Old Scottsdale where all the bars and stores are located but as I walked in, it was packed with people.  There is a huge bar area and live music playing all night long.  I ordered the bone in filet medium rare but it was cooked almost medium which I was a little unhappy about but the steak was very flavorful, soft and tasted really good.  The plate comes out extremely hot and I didn't want my steak to be cooked too much so the waiter put it on a cold plate.  I also ordered the lobster mashed potatoes because I was told it was extremely good but no one told me it would cost as much as my steak...  Most sides costs around $10 but this side cost me $35 which I didn't know because it was the special and not listed on the menu.  For that price, I was really disappointed with it because it was good but not that good.  I also got the sugar snap peas which cost me $10 and I thought it was better than the lobster mashed potatoes.  I also tried some of my friend's rack of lambs and it was pretty good too.  The service was really good and our waiter kept checking on us.  They even gave us a complimentary dessert which was their butter cake with vanilla icecream and it was really good.  Overall, I thought it was a good steakhouse but I think I expected better."}
{"text":"Mastro's has always been a favorite steakhouse of mine and has never disappoint. I took my best friend here for her birthday and she was in love.   We both ordered the 24oz porterhouse with lobster tails. For our sides we picked the lobster mashed potatoes and the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi to share (my absolute favorite! And I think hers now too)   The waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating! It was her first time at Mastro's and they were kind to take the time to go over the menu with her and answer any questions she had. They did a great job surprising her with dessert at the end for her birthday. She still talks about the dinner we had to this day"}
{"text":"Great steak, great service, great atmosphere. Always make a celebration that much more memorable. Bring your big boy wallet when dining here. I suggest you leave room for dessert because, they are almost as much of a highlight as the steaks."}
{"text":"The Fiancé and I went to Mastro's for our anniversary last night and everything was amazing. Our server Allison was amazing with recommendations and service. We had the ahi tuna tostadas to start. They were fantastic. I had the Bone in KC Strip which was to die for. My fiancé had the Chef's Choice NY and he said it was phenomenal. For sides we had the Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese and the mouth watering and perfect lobster mashed potatoes. We ended our amazing food venture with 2 desserts. Of course we had the BUTTER CAKE...Ahhhhh the greatest dessert in life. And also our complimentary chocolate cake. We will definitely be coming back to this one!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area! The service and attention to detail are incredible; the food is even better! I look for any excuse I can come up with to have dinner here. Most recently, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. She had never been so I figured it was a good excuse to introduce her to Mastros.   We had a table for two in the dinning room, at 7:30 on a Saturday (I have also eaten outside, the outside dining area is very nice but small. Make sure you call as far in advance as possible if you want to sit outside). Anyways, when we got there the place was packed. The bar area was packed and there was live entertainment. All the tables in the dining room were taken.   The service was perfect and our server was always there to fill up our drinks when we needed her. The bread basket contains many different types of bread, however the pretzel bread is by far the best! We started out with salad and the lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is soo rich and is full of chunks of lobster. It's a must order every time! My girlfriend got the filet and I got the New York strip. Both steaks were incredible, but the filet at Mastros is second to none. I won't make the mistake of not ordering filet there every again! For sides we got the lobster mashed potatoes and the asparagus. The lobster mashed potatoes are absolutely incredible! We followed up the meal with the butter cake, which was complimentary because it was girlfriend's birthday. The butter cake is best desert I have ever had. It's so rich and topped with ice cream, fresh fruit and whipped cream. You might as well skip Mastros if you are not going to get the butter cake!   We had an amazing time and all of the food was excellent. I will certainly return to Mastros as soon as I can find another excuse! Best steakhouse in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"It's Mastro's for goodness sakes. What's not to love? Valet parking, grand entry and hospitable hostesses are the first to impress. We had reservations for 7pm but showed up a little after six. We figured we enjoy a few drinks at the bar while we wait for our table. Not the case, we were seated right away and had a perfect view of the patio dining area and bar.  We started with the foie gras which was absolutely delicious! When the Mr and I found out AZ served this dish we both wanted to cry! Lol JK but we truly we're excited and shared an order. The warm apple cinnamon sauce that accompanied the foie gras created a perfect balance between the salty sear and greens of the dish. The lightly toasted white bread allowed the Flavors to open up and not take away from the delectable dish. I also ordered the French onion soup which was also above average, and in keeping with the foie gras, it's rich flavor and cheesy goodness was French-tastic!  For our main entree we decided to share the 18oz bone-in filet mignon medium rare. So lean, thick and juicy the filet was the perfect cut to share. As for the side dish, well that was a meal in itself! Say it with me,  \" King Crab leg, black truffle gnocchi \" ahhhhhmazing!  The service we received was just wonderful and upon speaking with the manager who came to make sure our filet was grilled to our liking, he mentioned that the butter cake was a must to try! Sadly, we saved no room for dessert however, we do have our next menu choices prepared for our return visit.  Mastro's is a classy, perfect date night choice and one of the better upscale restaurant dining experiences I've had. I tend to stay away from places like this because the food never lives up to the pricing but here I felt we definitely received the best of the best all around.  So a 5 star \" dark, romantic, perfect mood, perfect food, looking, feeling sexy with live music\" dining experience at Mastro's City Hall."}
{"text":"my expectations were high after visiting Mastro's in California, but this was a bit disappointing. I got the 22 ounce bone in rib eye and it was over seasoned. the Brussels sprouts were also over seasoned. mushrooms, over seasoned. the lobster mash potatoes happened to be the only side that we ordered that wasn't over seasoned. when it came to desert, the butter cake was sold out!   overall not the experience I was expecting, especially after waiting 30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants the food is outstanding and the service is just as outstanding. It is a very dark restaurant but that won't stop me from revisiting. The music is good in the bar and the bathroom attendants are very nice and helpful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite steak house/chop house/restaurant in all of Scottsdale.  Location, Menu & Quality (Buttercake)"}
{"text":"Wow - this restaurant is a real treat!  Advance reservations required- and it is expensive - but it's well worth it!  You may see a major league ball player or two there as well......players with family, agents.........it's very popular with the athletes!  The steak portions are huge - delicious....it is a bit dark and can be quite loud.  Tables are rather close to each other.  But we were fortunate to be seated in a back area that is used for special events/large groups.....so it was quite lovely and quiet back there.  You don't get to do all the people watching there - but it's about your guests and your food, right?"}
{"text":"Went to City Hall for the first time last night....it was a GREAT time. Good experience, good service, beautiful facility, live music, and the food....oh - the yummy food! It was so good, someone stole a friend's leftovers from the patio when they walked away for a minute.  - I would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"What a great steakhouse and seafood! Bone on filet and sea bass was amazing. Also they offer a great seafood platter that is a must!!! And you should try their roasted Brussels sprouts! Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Mastro's hardly needs another review since most people know this restaurant is five stars all the way. Last night my girlfriend and I spent our three year anniversary at the City Hall location. We sat in the bustling bar area with the band playing nearby. It was the perfect location for people watching and not too close to the band so we could hear each other.  I usually go to Mastro's Ocean Club about once a year and this was my first time to the City Hall location and I think I like this one better now.   We started with the calamari as an appetizer. It was deliciously breaded and came with an excellent dipping sauce. For the main course we shared the Chilean Sea Bass and a 12oz Filet Mignon. The Sea Bass melts in your mouth and the filet was cooked to medium rare perfection. Our side dishes were creamed spinach, gorgonzola macaroni and cheese, and scalloped potatoes. Each were phenomenal. Nothing wrong with this meal. Our $51 bottle of Charles Krup Cabernet was a great choice to accompany our meal. It reminded me of an even better J. Lohr.  I forgot I mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary to the hostess when making the reservation about a month before. So when we were greeted with a chocolate cake at the end of our meal it was a very nice surprise. It was delicious and a perfect way to end an outstanding night. (check out the pic I posted)  For a more relaxed atmosphere, sit in the dinning room area. For a more fun and active nightlife type of scene, I recommend sitting in the bar area. There is also nice outdoor seating by a fireplace."}
{"text":"I ordered the sea bass.  A thick piece of fish.  Prepared a little on the rare side.  The spicy mambo salad tasted ordinary but with generous portion.  A gigantic bowl of sweet potato fries.  Enough for 7 to share.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  It was rich and delicious. That might as well be my main entree.  The most enjoyable was their signature butter cake.  It's big enough for three people to share."}
{"text":"Another 4-5 star steakhouse.  My co-worker and I were out in AZ and I had asked for a one off style place to eat and the valet suggested this place.Food was good, not great.  I had the Ahi-Tuna Sashimi style.  It's really hard to screw that up so I can't really judge based on that meal.  However I did have the brussell sprouts as a side dish and was not impressed.    The service was very, very slow at the beginning with a solid 5-7 minute wait before anyone even came to our table.  The place was not busy either.  Once to the table the service seemed to get better though.  The atmosphere was filled with rich warm woods and a collection of etched glass paneling so it was very nice.  Light fixture were really cool and the bar area had a really cool red ambient lighting to it.  The only problem.....the lighting was too low!  I mean it's ok to dim it down a bit but not to the point I feel like I'm in a cave.  All in all I would recommend this place but probably sit in the bar next time just to make sure I had ample lighting even if it is red :)"}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse in town - hands down.  The filet and lobster mashed potatoes are impossible to beat.  Great (and huge!) martinis.  Great staff in the bar area!"}
{"text":"What else can I say that others haven't already mentioned? The lady taking reservations did say there is a 50% discount, but when we got our bill, it was only 30% off. We mentioned the difference and management corrected it, so we were happy. But for military to come eat at this expensive 5-star steakhouse for 30% off, that's a huge deal! Loved the food and best part was all the exotic cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I have dined here many times and yet to have a bad experience.  Whether it is a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary or just popping in for a delicious dinner, I have always had first class service and amazing food.  I love the bone-in ribeye steak!  However, the fish is as fresh and tasty as any restaurant on the coast.  Be careful when ordering sides because it is very easy to order too much food and then you don't have room for dessert!  Try the butter cake.  As for the wine list, there are great selections by the glass or the bottle.  The only downside:  they don't have a happy hour or any specials.  Why not?  Because they don't have to!  It is expensive and people are always willing to pay.  Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"The food and waitstaff were exceptional all around.  The ambiance would have been enjoyable had the place not been crawling with prostitutes and, I assume, their potential patrons being ushered to the back of the restaurant by security detail with earpieces throughout the evening.  It really ruined what was otherwise a phenomenal dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh Yeah!!! Thank you Yelpers for helping me find this gem. Definitely a home run in many ways. It sits at the head of an executive office complex. Attending a Research Chefs convention and needed to find the best of the best. Since I was with the\"meat group\" I needed to find a good steakhouse that didn't let me down. This is it. Three of us had the bone in filet which is excellent. The bone in NY Strip and KC Strip are the same and my guest was somewhat disappointed. Had the seafood tower which they created for the 6 of us. Everyone had oysters, lobster tail, crab claws, king crab and jumbo shrimp. That would have been enough for dinner. Our top meathead had the bone in ribeye which is a hard to find item in many restaurants. Even for a guy from Kansas City. For sides we ordered the sauteed mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Served family style. Dessert was amazing as well. Huge pieces of chocolate cake, 3 large scoops of ice cream and I had my usually Mexican coffee served with fresh whipped cream. And to top things off, at the bar we ran into some ball players there for spring training. My customer and I got a pic with Rickey Henderson which capped off the night. They drove us back to our downtown Phoenix hotel in their Escalade."}
{"text":"The steak, seafood and sides were excellent.  Service was top notch.  And the butter cake with fresh whipped cream and ice cream was stellar.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Always a great place !  The pretzel bread is great ! Steaks are always awesome. I tried the bone in filet, which was really good.  Next time I will go with the regular filet, it seems to be less fatty and not have to deal with the bone.  Service is always excellent !!  My favorite steak in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is the new standard in steakhouses.  FAST prompt service, great coctails, great wine list.  The new york strip was soft as butter with a perfect flavor.  HOMEMADE whip cream brought in great amounts to accompany the mouth watering butter cake. was worth the whole evening."}
{"text":"When we first arrived for dinner the dining and bar area were very cold. My first complaint is with the menu; it doesn't detail what's in the salads or any meal for that matter. The service was ok, but we were competing against college football, so I can kind of understand why it was a little inattentive.  The calamari was absolutely wonderful which is a lot coming from someone who grew up in the northwest. As far as the main course it was very disappointing. We ordered our steak between rare and medium rare; it come cooked about medium and under seasoned. We sent the steak back, but only told the waiter that the steal was over cooked (because we feared it would be sent back overly salty).  The steak returned blue rare and overly salty, which for me is better then over cooked so we didn't mention is incorrect temperature. The gnocchi was great, but the king crab that was mixed into the gnocchi was clearly not fresh.  I understand all king crab is flash frozen, but this crab did not taste good by any means. The main attraction on the dinning table was the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese which was incredible.   After our meal was complete the waitstaff noticed we didn't eat the gnocchi so they took it off of our bill.  Which is really great; not something we expected. Even with the nice gesture we without a doubt won't be back for round two. The food and drinks are very over priced for what you get. I am all about spending a pretty penny on a fantastic meal, but most everything we"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. First of all, the ambiance of this place is terrible. It feels like a steak cafeteria with a giant, open floor that's very noisy. It's not intimate at all so it pretty much rules out ever going on a date here. They also had some cheesy music playing.  The food was decent. In particular, I thought the complimentary warm pretzels and the mac and cheese were outstanding. For my steak I decided to go with the ribeye. I feel that a ribeye is the best test of a steakhouse because it can be amazing if it's a good cut and prepared well but it's generally harder to deliver a great ribeye than a great filet. The ribeye was disappointing. Although it was cooked to order (medium rare) and had good flavor, it was a lot tougher than I would expect for a $40+ steak.  The lack of ambiance combined with uninspiring steak means I'll probably avoid this place (and the numerous other Mastro's locations). I wish I had taken my friend's recommendation and gone to Bourbon Steak instead."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ-Everything was delicious. Filets were good, the Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were fabulous sides. The buttercake dessert was amazing even though we could barley eat anymore. Great place for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses that I have been to. Attended an event here, and the food was really good!  The staff was very nice and welcoming too. An all around good place to eat. I ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. I did try someone's steak and it too was amazing. Not a good place for kids though because the steaks come out of the kitchen sizzling and the plates are extremely hot. Perfect place for a date, group of friends or company dinner party."}
{"text":"Just had v-day dinner at Maestro.  Food was beyond amazing and we could not had a better server Allan - so attentive as waiters should all strive to be even though the restaurant was very busy.   Can be pricey but worth the money."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite steakhouse.  Great service, great atmosphere.  I was a regular customer of this place, at least once a month until I moved away.  I always requested to be in Allan's section.  He is a great server.  Seating can be tight, especially during peak hours.    Everything on the menu is a la carte, but the serving size is generous.    There are so many things on the menu (and not on the menu) that I would recommend......splurge on the lobster mashed potato dish....the shrimp cocktail is always a favorite....(their atomic horseradish is ridiculous, but I can't stay away from it).....and they have a great Riesling by Kuhl.  (Jacked up price as always but difficult to find in stores).  If you've been to Morton's or Flemings, try this place.  It's waaaay better."}
{"text":"I have always liked the Mastro's restaurants - but this was my first visit to City Hall. The location is convenient and they offer car service if you have too many martini's and need to be taken home (or on to more drinks) after wards. The martini list alone is worth a visit to this place!   Our service was fantastic - never had to wait for a drink, food came out quickly and correct. The bar scene was lively, and they had live music too! We started with the seafood tower (there were 4 of us) but there was sooo much yummy goodness that we could have gone without even ordering dinner! It had huge shrimp, oysters, King Crab legs, and lobster too! Yum! And the presentation was impressive as well with a giant tower and dry ice....  The steaks are good, and they have nice options for chicken and fish eaters too! Great place for a work dinner or a night out with friends. My friends and I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great place to have an intimate dinner, fantastic food and music. Wife and I have been 3 times she gets the chicken,me the steak...oh so perfectly cooked and seasoned it melts in your mouth. Can't plan our next trip back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Yum! Try the bone in filet! So much flavor and juiciness! I ordered it medium, I probably should of ordered medium well but it's still so delicious. We ordered sides of lobster mashed potatoes, asparagus and sautéed mushrooms. For appetizers we had crispy calamari and seared ahi tuna... yum. Seriously yum yum yum.. probably about to order dessert right now too. Yes I'm still here; and I had to spread the word right away!"}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale on the annual Gentleman's Golf Extravaganza and found this place through Yelp, so big shout out to all of you in AZ for hooking it up!  The thing that cracks me up most about this place is that the girls were all my age, and all the men were my father's age - second wife's club to the fullest.  Started off at the bar knocking down some Maker's on the rocks - great steakhouse pours here.  Two drinks was probably about 5-6 shots in total.  Great bread basket - the pretzel bread kicks ass.  Shrimp cocktail was great, especially with about 4 tablespoons of horseradish in the cocktail sauce.  The steaks were better than I expected, being from NYC (hate me).  We had the chef's ribeye, porterhouse, strip, and filet.  All expertly cooked and great tasting.  Had the lobster mashed potatoes, which were good, but not mind blowing in my personal opinion.   Great wine list to boot.     Also - they will grab you a car service at the check in podium to get you home... very important to my group being that we never have a designated driver since we are used to taking cabs everywhere.  After 3 bottles of a nice spicy pinot we were toasted and headed back to the hotel for a chipping contest off our balcony into the hotel pool below.  I still owe Christian C. fifty bucks for his off the lobby roof-onto the patio-into the jacuzzi shot.  Let's see Tiger try that ish out."}
{"text":"Always packed but the staff is always on point. Food is good and the seasoning they sprinkle on the plate adds flavor. I'm not personally a fan of the hot plate but I just let my server know to give me a room temperature plate.   The lobster bisque is by far the BEST I have ever had!!!  Pretty much an entire lobster tail in it. There's been times I have just ordered the bisque!  Drinks are super strong...just the way I like them!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse. I like the dark lighting, it makes dinner a little more personal. I absolutely love the mash potatoes."}
{"text":"Always great food, love the scallops appetizer. Fu atmosphere. Amazing steak. Been many times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place rocks.  We were in town for a seminar and asked a  few people for recommendations on a steakhouse.  This place  seemed to be on a lot of locals radar.  The place was fantastic!  The atmosphere, the food, the drinks- all top notch.  I shared the 48oz double porterhouse with a friend cooked medium rare plus.  It was perfect- juicy and cooked throughout and amazingly on the table within 10 minutes.  The brussel sprouts and sauteed spinach were also delicious.  Had a very generously poured Manhattan served with a refill in the shaker.  The Key Lime Pie, vanilla butter cake and chocolate sin cake were all amazing as well although I would've been content with the dish of fresh whipped cream that accompanied the desserts.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The service is really good and the people watching is quite interesting! We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms and we didn't care for them at all! They were undercooked and mealy!  Thgood thing is that they took them of the bill. The sauteed shrimp were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Updated review - they totally redeemed themselves.  Tommy & Gary rocked it tonight.  Gary made the night great.  Excellent service and food.  We will be back many more times.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  This is my favorite place to eat.  I highly recommend the butter cake!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend took me to Mastro's City Hall for my birthday last night and I have to say this place may become a birthday tradition. I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate.  First, they brought out a huge bread basket. The rolls were so fresh and delicious. The pretzel rolls are amazing. The perfect way to start. Then, we each got a petite filet and the mac and cheese and sweet potato fries for our sides. Everything was so good. The steak was done perfectly, very very tender and every bite was delicious. I usually add salt to my steak but this one was so flavorful I didn't need it. It comes on a hot plate, similar to Ruth's Chris but without the butter.   The sides were tasty as well. The sweet potato fries were probably the best I've ever had and the mac and cheese was very decadent.    When my boyfriend made reservations he had mentioned it was my birthday. It was such a surprise when they came to the table with a huge slice of chocolate cake with \"Happy Birthday Holly\" written on the plate in chocolate. It really made the evening extra special.  And the service was outstanding. Our water glasses were never less than half-full, the food was paced perfectly and our waiter was friendly and attentive. They even called today to make sure we had a good experience. You don't see that kind of follow up very often.  I can't wait to visit Mastro's City Hall again. I may need to figure out an excuse to celebrate before my next birthday!"}
{"text":"Wow this Mastros location knows how to cook a mean steak!  My ribeye tasted even better than their Newport Beach location!  Mastros is always good and a satisfying meal so I don't know what else to write.  This location cooked one of the best tasting bone-in ribeyes I've ever eaten.  Oh yeah, my lady's lamb chops we're spectacular too.  WOW!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a very nice dinner at Mastro's City Hall last night. We sat in the bar area at one of the side tables. We enjoyed a bottle of sparkling wine with our dinner. The beef carpaccio was delicious and it was a very large portion. Great to share.  I loved my  half portion of the Mastro's salad (with lots of shrimp). Its great that they offer half sizes on salads and sides. The server (Andrew) was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a let down, to be honest.  For starters we ordered the Alaskan King Crab stuffed mushrooms which came on a \"what was supposed to be a sizzling pan\" and the dish was warm, maybe closer to room temperature. It tasted good, but there's nothing I dislike more than \"hot\" food served cold. We also ordered the house salad which was mediocre at best, it had too much dressing. And for main we had the bone in ribeye which was just okay. We ordered lobster mashed potatoes which was really good (the only reason this review is 3 stars and not 1) and roasted Brussel sprouts which they probably should call burnt brussel sprouts as they were burnt to a crisp, inedible.  Also the service is nothing like what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant.   The whole time we were there, I kept telling my husband we should've gone to Steak 44 instead, better in EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"This is a $250 review, so bear with me, Brent. ;)  Three stars.. but I like the \"Meh\" description that two stars invokes.  Our server was not around as much as we would have liked him to be. After we were seated at our table it was quite a few minutes before he came around to take our drink orders. Then another few minutes (normal wait time plus a few extra minutes) before he came back with the drinks. The menu merely lists each dish with a price. There are no descriptions. Our server didn't suggest any of the more popular cuts of meat, didn't show us the raw tray. Didn't tell us if the beef is corn- or grass-fed. Didn't suggest any particular salads or sides. He just showed up ready to take the order. In his defense, however, I did have a few questions about the cut of beef I chose and how I might like to have it cooked, and he did seem knowledgable about that, but in my experience with a restaurant with this kind of reputation, he should be offering us recommendations and telling us a little bit about the aging process (dry or wet?) and the cooking methods. We started with salads. The chopped salad was just that: chopped lettuce, chopped cabbage, shredded cheese, tossed in a bland dressing with light consistency. I had four bites and was done. I would have had more but it was so dark in there I couldn't see well enough to pick out the cheese. The Caesar salad didn't have any actual anchovies on it but had a very strong fishy flavor. Almost too strong. The bread basket was freaking awesome. Pretzel bread, crisp parmesan crouton bread, and olive bread with huge pieces of olives baked in. I had a hard time putting that down. The bone-in filet was the best part of my date's meal and my bone-in veal (I know, I know, save me a seat in hell) was amazing. This is a steakhouse, they really know how to cook up a cut of cow. The meat was rich, tender, juicy, and had light crisp carmelization around the edges. It was perfection. However... everyone on this board has a hard-on over these lobster mashers. The lobster mashed potatoes: I do not know what the big deal is. Here we've got about three cups' worth of mashed potatoes which were heavy on the cream and butter. But on top of that rests a pile of lobster chunks. Maybe 3/4 of a cup worth. Yes, they were good 1 1/2-inch chunks, but even if I mixed up the bowl myself (which I would have to do, as the dish is obviously served this way so you can SEE the quality of the meat you're getting), there is no way I would EVER describe this as \"chunks of lobster THROUGHOUT.\" It could have used some salt or other seasoning. And no, this is not on the menu; I expected it to be about $30, and I was about right. The lobster mashed potatoes, like the rest of the experience in the restaurant, wasn't bad. I would not describe it as bad. But the constant raving and drooling that many of the reviewers are going on and on about created an expectation for me that this restaurant did not live up to. At these prices (and in some cases LOWER than these prices), you can get more personalized service and better flavor in all of your plates in actual famous restaurants in Los Angeles and New York. I'm not trying to sound all bitched-out and bougie about it, I just feel that I was misled into thinking that things were going to be of a certain caliber in this particular restaurant, and it wasn't. I mean, the bathroom was dirty! There were wads of dirty toilet tissue thrown in the corners of the stall like in the bathroom at a Mexican beach. And the attendant in the bathroom sat in the chair with her friend who was hanging out in there with her and I could hear her proclaim very loudly that she wasn't going to hand out any more towels tonight. What the hell...? You know who did do an awesome job - the bussers and the servers. Not our table server, who merely takes the order and occasionally brings you a drink... but the actual men who are serving the food itself. There is a grip of people who work at the restaurant who actually bring out the plates of food you ordered and clean them up when you are finished and I doubt they are getting an equal split of the tips from the \"main\" servers. Those guys were very attentive and working hard. We did not order dessert. Our disappearing server came by and dropped the dessert menu on the table and walked off, with no mention of even coffee. The dessert menu, by the way, is a small section on a page inside the drink menu. And there are no descriptions of any of the desserts, just names and prices. If I had a question about what one or two of the desserts were, it was irrelevant because our server was nowhere to be found. And being that the salads and side were nothing to write home about, we decided against ordering dessert. So... overall, I won't be suggesting this spot nor will I be bringing guests of my own here."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a special occasion and were treated to this fine dining experience while visiting Scottsdale. Valet parking is offered but if you arrive for an early dinner (before 6;30pm) self parking is convenient.  We were seated promptly though early for our reservation. Water was promptly delivered to our table though we quickly realized that it was so dark inside and the print was so small on the menu, we all needed flashlights to make our choices.  Our waiter Michael explained that portions were quite large and easily shareable--given this is rated $$$$, we were happy to share. My husband and I shared an 18oz boneless rib eye, split a wedge and an order of asparagus. It was more than enough food for each of us! (BTW, plates are sizzling hot when delivered to the table--they weren't joking!)  As a treat, the waiter delivered their famed butter cake, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and their house made whipped cream on the side! Save room for this delight--again to share!  It was most definitely one of our finest dining experiences ever.  Note: the restaurant is quite large, very dark and does get quite noisy. Dine early--it will be more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Mastros for years but the last few times have been a disappointment and I will no longer be going. First, butter is not the only way to make food delicious. ASecond, if you are ordering lite the wait staff doesn't seem to approve and tend to treat you poorly."}
{"text":"This was the best steak I've had! The service was great and the manager even came by to make sure that I was enjoying my experience there.  I will defiantly be going there again soon. Brian K from Mesa, AZ"}
{"text":"My sister and I are visiting from San Antonio, Texas and wanted to eat a nice dinner. We came here because of all the great reviews on here. It did not disappoint. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were huge. At least 4 people can eat off of one side. We got the seafood tower, 16oz New York strips, sautéed asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes, almond green beans and then the butter cake for dessert. It was a ton of food, we had to take half of it home. The butter cake has to be one of my favorite dessert dishes of all time. It was amazing. Even if you are full from dinner, order the butter cake no matter what. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Steak was perfect, sides were delectable... My makeup looked great in the light & the wine kept flowing.  The bathroom attendant was the best part of my night, love the personality & helpfulness she provided... I will certainly be back here !!"}
{"text":"You already now. Another Mastros experience. Always great. Gotta have the Butter Cake. Steak on point side always good."}
{"text":"Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out.   Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room."}
{"text":"Mastro's is a classic, and pretty much speaks for itself. Everything is luxurious from the napkins to the food to the decor and ambiance. Came here for a work dinner and got some funny looks for being in scrubs, but the food was out of this world delicious and the wine was fantastic. The dessert was to die for, they didn't miss a single detail. The main dining area is a bit dark for my liking, it's tough to see the other people in your party, but I guess it's all in the \"mood lighting.\" All in all you can't ever go wrong with Mastro's for sure."}
{"text":"Best Mastro's in the country. Newport doesn't even compare to this one, nor does the one in North Scottsdale.   If you want an amazing atmosphere that is indicative of a great, dimly lit, steak house then go no further. Best porterhouse in the business. First date, birthday, anniversary, or even last date, it won't disappoint.   The definition of wine and dine."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful service, great wine selection. Pricey, but you know that going in and definitely worth it. The wedge salad was amazing, and the petite filet indescribable. Also had oysters, lobster mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was done perfectly. You MUST try the butter cake- hands down the best dessert I have ever had. Without any doubt. Make sure you bring an appetite and friends to sample many things. The only complaint I might have is the entry area is cramped and awkward. But how much time do you plan to spend there? Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. 5 Stars through and through. My boyfriend and I came on Valentine's day this year and the service was excellent as well as the food. That night, we wanted to go all out so we each ordered our own steak and had the lobster mashed potatoes, and the butter cake for dessert. All of it was amazing.   Most recently we tried it out a second time because we had gotten a gift card. They had sat us in the back of the restaurant but I requested to be seated in the main dining room and they of course moved us right away to a great little booth. I like the main dining room better because it has a see and be seen vibe to it and you can hear the music from the lounge area which is always great.  Every time I go there we will always get the stuffed mushrooms and request extra pretzel bread. Every time I take a bit of those I just wish I knew how to make them myself. For main course we decided to share the Chef's cut Rib Eye and get the Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts. I highly recommend if your shying away from Mastro's because of price, that is an excellent option. You get an unbelievably juicy and delicious steak, they split it for us into 2 plates and the sides were delicious. Thanks for another amazing night out Mastro's. Nailed it."}
{"text":"One of the best steak houses i've been to hands down. Very nice and classy place."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience!  I don't think I have had a better meal out like this was for a long time.  You have a big fan here in Northern California who will be back next year when I come down for spring training baseball.  Oh and my dog loved the porterhouse steak bone I brought home too!!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it.  Sometimes it just comes down to the meat.  At these prices I expected way better in terms of preparation.  The people were great.  Our waiter was very attentive, keeping my bottle of beer off the table and refrigerated, then coming back to refill my glass every third sip or so.  That's a bit over the top to me but it seemed to make him happy.  Ambiance?  Well, the lighting is very nice, but really it's a big rectangular floor.  What are you gonna do with that?  Well, they put table after table after table.  Not much imagination but lots of room to bring in the business.  As I said, sometimes it comes down to the food and Wednesday night was no exception.  My medium rare rib-eye was at best medium-well and WAY over-salted.  When will these places learn that a few non-nonchalant flicks of the wrist in the kitchen with the salt shaker can quickly equate to the immediate destruction of what was once a very nice piece of meat?  I was at a business dinner so I just wasn't going to spin the cycles to send it back.   GUYS in the kitch!  Listen! (hands on your shoulders and shake, shake, shake)--lay off the salt and medium-rare means I need to see blood!  This isn't Wendy's.  3/2 addendum:  Only fair that I make note of the fact that less than a week after I posted my review someone at Mastro's reached out to me over email.  If nothing else they seem to be concerned for their image and as such they would like me to come back in and give them another chance.  Fair enough, except I only budgeted for one Mastro's visit in this lifetime.  I don't know if I am willing to gamble the price of a Mastro's dinner check on something that has so far been sub-standard, but I thought I should pass along that fact that they reached out to me.  When I am back in Scottsdale I will give the idea some consideration."}
{"text":"Husband & I came in on Sunday night for Restaurant week.  What a GREAT deal for $40.  We have been here more times than I can count, but never for restaurant week.    As usual, they start with the great bread basket. Love the pretzel bread.  I had the chopped salad and my husband had the caesar.  I am not a huge fan of the chopped, but wasn't in the mood for caesar.   We both had their petite filet (which is $36 on their regular menu!).   As most restaurants give you just 3 courses for restaurant week, City Hall also includes 2 sides (garlic mashed & creamed spinach) served family style.   A warning about them, though, 2 runners served the sides to us as soon as the sizzling steak plates were set down..... grease started popping like crazy... on my blouse and on my face.  (took 3 washings with de-greasers to get the stains out of the blouse). We were disappointed that their famous buttercake wasn't a dessert choice, but the profiterole was good and my husband had the chocolate cake.  He said it was very rich.   As is the norm, we are never let down when eating here.  I'm thinking of changing one of our other restaurant week reservations so that we can go back."}
{"text":"The food at Mastro's is amazing as always, but unfortunately after we got our food and the service kind of went downhill."}
{"text":"I just love Mastro's City Hall food is amazing great atmosphere  A bit pricey but certainly worth every penny that you pay for the food is always to perfection"}
{"text":"Great steaks at a great location.  Sides are just OK.  Sometimes the service seems hurried and not too personal but overall a great place to get your steak on."}
{"text":"I'm salivating just thinking about the lobster mash, oh yea the steak is pretty fabulous too. There is not bad to say about this place, go with a big group and indulge in the seafood tower, its a must. The service is amazing, one time my good friend Adam tried to see if he could get his glass filled with ice since the waiter was on top of his water and never let it reach half full. He didn't succeed but also didn't have enough room for the butter cake for dessert! I've eaten at many great restaurants around the world and this one hold a place close to my stomach."}
{"text":"If you want to know about the food, there is not doubt that the steak here is out of this world!! I really can't remember what parts of the cow I ate, since I had a little of this and that, but I do know it was all buttery and delicious, cooked perfectly.  The butter cake at the end was a fabulous, but as rich as it was, I really only needed a few bites.  The gnocchi was delicious.  All complimented well by the Layer Cake Shiraz.      Now for everything else, the ambience is amazing.  It's very modern and romantic.  Nice bathrooms, nice decor, the bar has a fabulous live band that actually sounds like a CD if you're not paying attention.  If you come here on a Saturday night, you probably won't be paying attention...  First of all, I've heard of these steakhouses where a girl can put on a dress and heels, and come away with her meal paid for by some rich bastard. This is that place.  Ladies and gents, just an FYI, this place is 90% men.  If you are a female hanging out at the bar, expect to be swimming through testosterone.  This can be good or bad...I write this review wondering if I should be ashamed of writing about taking a free meal, or ashamed to be bragging about it a little...what the heck, none of the above... let me brag.  I'll just call it \"helping a sister out\".   Lots of large tables of sausage parties here, I'm just saying...definite entertainment value here...  Oh, and the service was pretty good, a little lackluster at their busiest time, but it was really really packed that night.  Note, it was almost impossible to find the entrance to the valet.  I circled twice around. I think there might have been some construction around the entrance.    I will come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service from Chris! Cocktails were delicious, especially the Tiki Time martini. Steaks were cooked to perfection and the lobster mashed potatoes were absolutely divine. Perfect setting for a romantic dinner. It was pretty loud but it was a Friday night and I can understand why it's so packed; it's amazing!! Fancy but not at all stuffy, expensive but totally worth it. Anyone who doesn't give 5 stars must be crazy. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very fancy restaurant. The steaks are incredible along with some Moscato wine. The waiter was very attentive with our needs. To top it off I got a birthday slice on the house."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  I had the best time here with my boyfriend at the time (fiance now).  We spent our 3 year anniversary here at City Hall Mastro's in Old Town Scottsdale.  We had a great table in the bar area where we could see everything going on and listen to some great music.  The service was great, decor was lovely, and the location is perfect.    We started with the calamari as an appetizer and it was delicious.  I had the Chilean Sea bass and he got the 12oz Filet Mignon. For sides, we got the creamy spinach, gorgonzola macaroni and cheese, and the scalloped potatoes......of course we split everything.  I was quite surprised at how much I love the scalloped potatoes...... I'm getting hungry just thinking about all this food.    Also, the staff came over and surprised us with a chocolate cake for our anniversary.  It was the perfect way to end the night."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in the valley.  Absolutely amazing!  It is super expensive, but the food is delicious, and the ambeince is nice.  A special occasion kind of place, if you have the cash."}
{"text":"In a sentence: Liked, didn't love.  In a novel...  Came here for my wife's birthday in February (this review is long overdue), and had a reservation noting the occasion. The host staff was great about it, at least 3 different people wished her a happy birthday. It was a nice touch.   We were walked back to the dining room and seated in a booth/table combo at the back of the restaurant. Ambiance was nice, I like the decor. VERY dark, but well lit in the right places so you could read a menu or see your dining partner. The tables are relatively close together, and we were pretty close to the other diners around us, but it wasn't too bad. The dining room is actually really loud, since they pack a lot of tables in there, the conversations work together to create a lot of sound.  Service was very good and attentive, we never wanted for anything. I started with a glass of wine, which was great, and the bread course. I thought the bread was OK, I'd heard the pretzel bread was amazing but I thought it was so so. We ordered salads, a Caesar for me and an heirloom tomato salad for my wife. My salad was good, my wife thought her tomatoes were a tad mealy...Not ideal for a $16 salad.   We each ordered bone in filets, with a side of scalloped potatoes and a twice baked potato. Filets were both cooked perfectly, medium-rare and were tender and flavorful. I didn't think the bone in was any better than the best bone out filets I've had, and it adds a fair amount to the price. If/when I go back, I'll stick to the bone out filets. Sides were just OK. The scalloped potatoes were a bit too cheesy (weird to say, but it was true), and the twice baked potato was so smoky from the bacon that it overwhelmed the flavor of everything else.  The dinner overall had been going pretty well, and we were really looking forward to the City Hall signature dessert, their butter cake. A few minutes after our main dishes were cleared, our server said \"your dessert will be right out\". The only issue is, we hadn't ordered dessert...We figured if they're making a decision on our behalf, they will serve the butter cake. Our dessert came, and it was a piece of their chocolate cake. I love chocolate cake, but it's not my wife's favorite and we were there for her birthday...The dessert was on the house, so I know it's petty to complain about it, but when all we'd heard about was the butter cake, we were disappointed that we weren't able to try it.   Overall, the dinner was pretty good. The steaks were the highlight, but everything else fell a little flat. The issue is, for the price, you expect more than \"pretty good\". I would gladly come to City Hall again and give them a second chance, and now that I know my way around a little bit, I might be able to navigate my way to a better overall meal."}
{"text":"Mastro's is if anything consistent, and frankly that's the big appeal of dining here. You name a city where a Mastro's is located and chances are I have dined there, and every single time I know I am going to get a basket of their delicious warm pretzel bread, the seafood tower will be spectacular, my filet cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the lobster mashed potatoes will go down as something I would eat for my last meal on this earth.  My meal at Mastro's City Hall was no different, delicious food, wonderful cocktails and spectacular service. It's the perfect spot to celebrate that special event or to just go and have a great glass of wine or martini paired with a delicious steak."}
{"text":"Had a pretty poor experience at City Hall after a series of increasingly frustrating visits and probably won't be back any time soon. The meal our group had was uniformly just OK, which doesn't match the prices. My filet, which I ordered rare, was thin and poorly cut, and poorly cooked. The filet was roughly one inch thick which makes it impossible to properly cook it rare. I was expecting a thick, center cut steak with a red, cool center. What I got was a chewy thin patty of a steak with a pink center. I immediately pointed this out to the server and the response was along the lines of \"what do you want me to do about it?\" A surprising response to a place that brags about its meats, butcher, and preparation. And a place that charges $51 for the pleasure. I know this is getting quite particular, but for a high end place they should know better--I'd expect this from the Outback, but not from Mastros.   On the positive side, it has a lively atmosphere for a steakhouse. Decent service in general although my repeated complaints were never addressed by anyone, much less taken off the very large bill."}
{"text":"My family has been coming for years and have never had a bad meal. It's amazing service from the time you make a reservation to the follow up call the next day. My only real complaint is it's a little to dark people using phones or a flash light to read a menu seems ridiculous. How can you tell if your steak is cooked right? The bone in ribeye is the best in my opinion and butter cake is my dad's hands down favorite dessert"}
{"text":"What can I say about Mastro's. It is the apex of steakhouses and fine dining. I took a first date there, in retrospect not the best place for a first date but it was amazing.   Everything was perfect. There was no defects with the meal. But all this perfection comes with a hefty price. I don't think I'm shocking the world with that statement. This place definitely goes my the saying, \"You get what you pay for.\" The price may be high but worth it in the end.   This place is great for special occasions or when you've got cash to blow. Worth checking out at some point in your life."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of this new year to be quite honest... I came with my family for my sister's birthday and felt the immediate rude energy from staff. We were seated right next to the live music, so understandably it was quite loud, and our waiter had to raise his voice to take our order. However, he did this in a way that made me extremely uncomfortable. He was visibly impatient if any one of us hesitated for a second or two or had any sort of questions about what we were ordering. It was our first time here-- but no one bothered to find that out and guide us through the process whatsoever. It was more of a \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?! HOW DO YOU WANT IT?!\" sort of deal that left me feeling like I had just been yelled at, stumbling over my words, getting all the answers wrong ABOUT MY OWN ORDER. I noticed however, that when he went to take the order of the people seated next to us, both his tone and body language were completely different. He answered their questions and seemed all around more friendly, just seconds after berating me for my order. I was stumped.   I'd also like to mention that whenever the waiter came around, he simply asked my father \"how are you doing? is everything perfect? would you like a refill?\" but did not even LOOK at any of the women in the family. If my father said he was good, the waiter just left. What if I had needed something? I guess he didn't think it was worth it to find out.   When the food came, it was obviously of high quality but left me unsatisfied in terms of flavor profile. It was also extremely heavy since I underestimated how large the portions are (I recommend considering sharing). We barely made a mark on any of our food, so we asked for all of it to be packed at the end of the meal.  Once we had all of our food taken back to be packed (allegedly,) we started getting up to leave. Because we came in 2 cars there was some miscommunication in terms of who had the food. A few minutes after driving away, we realized that we had forgotten our leftover food and one of our cell phones. This was about $300 worth of food, mind you, so we turned back right away. I decided to call the restaurant to let them know what was going on. I was put on hold while the hostess asked the manager. When the manager finally got on the phone, he was extremely rude to me. Don't know what I expected, to be honest. But not this. He started berating me saying \"what's going on here?! Who am I dealing with here?!\" Again, I felt myself stumbling for words. I was so taken aback by his tone. \"I've been told by staff that you said you didn't want any of your food packed,\" he declared. Well that was a complete lie-- we had asked multiple times that all of our food be packed. This was clear. It was $300 worth of food. I told him this, but at this point my father had arrived and was going inside. I told the manager to just talk to him since for some reason being a man makes everyone just take you much more seriously. I was appalled at this disaster at this point.   When my father went inside, he was told no phone was found. He was also told the same thing-- that we had asked our food not be packed. At this point it seemed like we were being accused of lying, which is simply offensive. After arguing with the manager, my father managed to get our bill reduced. He had to go by himself to physically check under our table, where he found the phone that apparently wasn't there. In my experience, at  a place of this caliber, the entire bill should have been taken care of after this inexcusable behavior.  But of course... can't expect much from this place.   By going to this restaurant, I was made to feel like a total idiot by multiple members of staff. Don't really know what I did to deserve that. Wish the experience could have been better.  Just wanted to add in what my father wrote to me after reading this review:  \"When I went in the manager told me the same thing. It is only whenI flat out asked him if he was accusing me of being a liar did he change his tone and offer to recook the food or offer me a discount. I again had to prove them wrong by finding the 'invisible' phone myself. Our waiter Chris was rude and needs retraining. I've eaten across the US, Europe, and Asia in nice establishments; however, I have never been treated this way before. There are many steakhouses in town with better steaks that will treat you with respect and dignity irrespective of your background. I definitely will not be returning.\""}
{"text":"Overpriced food.  Steaks not prepared as ordered.  Side dishes and salad were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary"}
{"text":"Do not valet park - those guys are absolute dicks unless you're in a Bentley. The service inside was top-shelf. The food was expectedly delicious. We had four people in our party: two of us had steaks which were perfectly cooked; one had the sea bass which was also very good; and the fourth person had the rack of lamb. He said the lamb was the very best he had ever had. For side dishes we had green beans, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mushrooms. They were fantastic. We shared a creme brûlée for desert which was a perfect end to a very good meal. All in all a good experience, except the a-holes running the valet. Money spends the same inside, but outside you will be judged on your four wheels."}
{"text":"A top must-try steak house!  Oh the perks of dining at restaraunts with a large group.  Basically a food tasting for me.  We started with the seafood tower.  I have rarely ever tasted seafood so fresh or even cold seafood that I thoroughly enjoy eating!  It comes with shrimp, crab legs, and Alaskan king crab.  I was sneaking more and more of the king crab in hopes that nobody would notice I was eating their share.  In addition to the seafood tower we ordered the Sauteed Shrimp (a MUST TRY!)  As entrees a friend and I shared the 12 oz. filet mignon medium rare as well as the twin lobster tails.  I wish I wasn't getting so full at this point as they were both beyond mouth watering!  Our sides included Asparagus, Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi, and Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese.  I have lost my taste for truffle but the Gnocchi is a must try as it is not an intense flavor at all.  My mouth is watering just writing this review.  All in all, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experience! The location, menu, food and service.   Even our 4 yr old agrees that this place was one of the best dining experience!"}
{"text":"Rib eye is heaven. Cream of spinach top notch. Crab claws warmed with butter for app. Forgetaboutit."}
{"text":"This was undeniably one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. Almost every element of this meal was pure heaven. The Strip Steak was so thick each bite must be masterfully cut (beware your eyes and stomach will betray you, eat slow), fresh garlic and butter dripping from every perfectly cooked inch onto a sizzling hot plate that their dapper and attentive waiters place before you.  The steak was so juicy and so tender you need only use a butter knife. Paired with a nice full bodied Cabernet, which the waiter recommended...I couldn't have asked for more. O wait but I did, I had a side of mashed potatoes (regular not the lobster) that was forgettable. It was not cheap, but honestly I cannot remember how much I paid...what I do remember is that amazing meal. Indulge and savor the steak at this Mastro's."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best steak I have ever had. Seafood tower is grand and delicious too. Cheesecake is amazing as well. At this point, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in near closing time just for a butter cake dessert. Service was a bit concerned by our arrival but happy to know it was just for dessert.  It was fabulous as expected and we ate it all. The location in downtown is great."}
{"text":"A month later, a Manager called me from Mastro's, apologized, and informed me that they updated their music.   He told me he was sending me a coupon or voucher, to make up for the bad experience and bad food, but 3 WEEKS LATER HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING.  City Hall again, has dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  You must order your steak one grade more rare to accommodate the 400 degree serving plates.  With a party of ten, some of whom came late, others had to leave early, it was flawless.  Thanks Maestro's.  MUCH less pretentious than the Beverly Hills location."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  The food is amazing, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, and came in for our Anniversary dinner.  Brian Hummell was our server, and was awesome!  He got my wife all the information she needed for Organic Red Wines.  She bought a bottle, and after first taste said that it was the best wine she's ever had!  She ordered the Salmon fillet and she loved it!  I had the 20 oz New York Strip.  It might have been the thickest steak I've ever seen!  It was glorious and perfectly cooked!  We had an awesome experience. Thank you Brian!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is less than 5 minutes from my house which is also another reason to hate it.  The parking at this place is so bad but it hasnt stopped me from coming and it wont.  It always seems to be busy for the times I have dined here which is by no mistake or chance at all...this is as good as it gets in Old Town...  If you have been to Mastros in North, North Scottsdale and Ocean Club then you will have a fair comparison although it doesnt quite have the best opportunity to people watch in the lounge like Ocean Club.  A bit too dark in terms of lighting in the dining room and if music is playing in the lounge then it is hard to talk over it...same for Ocean Club....the bathrooms are very impressive in terms of attention to detail...  As always, the filets are perfect with bearnaise sauce, any side can feed easily 3 people (lobster or wasabi mashed potatoes), wedge or ceasar salad, and any dessert will please....  Thank you Mark Levy and the Mastro Group....bravo again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse! Great night with friends, amazing food, wine, atmosphere! Service was outstanding too."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant is Durants, but we decided to give Mastros a try for my birthday.  We were looking forward to the piano bar, and vocalist. Too bad, we were sitting 10 feet from the piano and still couldn't hear the music.  It is very noisy in the lounge.  A day later and we are still waiting for the vocalist.  So we went to dinner in the dining room.  It was very crowded, noisy, and dark.  I can't believe they charge $11.00 for one baked potato.  The food was OK, but the prices were some of the highest we have ever paid.  They initially got my main course incorrect, and I was delivered veal instead of lamb.  After quite a wait we both finally got our main courses.  When the waiter brought us our final check I asked if they did something special for birthdays.  He replied that they did, a piece of chocolate cake.  We told him that my husband had made the reservation for my special birthday, and the reservation specialist even asked him how to spell my name.  So we were presented with a piece of chocolate cake, and Happy Birthday drizzled on the plate.  Of course my name was not included.  The waiter felt bad for us, apologized and comped us for our appetizer.  So at least he tried to make things better.  We most likely will never return to Mastros again."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of the Mastro's chain - so when we were in Scottsdale for the golf tourney this past weekend, we had to check it out! The location is great - right next to Scottsdale fashion square which is an amazing shopping destination. The restaurant is swanky and chic and gorgeoussss, and the crowd is definitely dressed to impress!  It was also super bowl weekend, so we naturally didn't get a rezzie, but I usually prefer sitting at the bar anyway, so we walked in with the expectation that we will have to wait for seats.  The place was JAMMING and so packed! The bar was overflowing and every table occupied. But a glass of wine in at the bar, we had committed to waiting for seats rather than going to a different restaurant.  There is also live entertainment at the bar, and a small dance floor for those interested!  The restaurant is perfect for people watching, so we did a fair amount of that while waiting. Also made friends at the bar so we got seats faster than anticipated.  Clutch!  We ordered a bottle of cab after sitting down and then got the following - 22 ounce bone in rib eye, large order of crab cakes, half order of sweet potato fries. Everything was sooooo delicious, including the generous bread basket they offer.  Steak was cooked perfect and served on a hot plate; cakes were meaty and seasoned right, and the fries almost tempura like and sooo addicting.   Mastro's seriously does not disappoint! And the price tag is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Shrimp cocktail and crab cakes are a must for apps.  Spicy caesar or French Onion for salad/soup option.  Kansas city bone-in a MUST for steak... Mouth watering.  Butter cake for dessert...You think you will just go in for a bite, but that isn't going to happen.  It's perfection."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Mastro's Ocean Club.. Newport beach and Las Vegas.  Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse is a different but the food is still the same. Awesome!  I took my then boyfriend, now fiancee, for his birthday dinner. He had bone marrow app --which I had them wrap up to-goand my small dogs still gnaw on-- and I tuna tataki. it was good. I had Sea bass.. and he had bone in rib eye.. Massive. I forget what kind of sides we had.. but it was good.. i think it mightve been lobster mac  We had a great time. the service was nice. there was a complimentary buttercake.  there was a mom dad and daughter sitting at the table next to us celebrating her graduating the top of her class. it was so sweet parents be so proud of their child :)  i wish the tables would be a ittle further apart so we don't have to accidentally ease drop on other peoples conversation!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. My husband and I came here for dinner on NYE and the food and service were top notch. It's a traditional steak house w many sides to choose from. They will even allow you to do half portions of the sides so that you can try many! We had the crab cocktail, shared a Caesar salad (the Caesar is huge, plenty to share between two people), the chop ribeye, and multiple sides including garlic mashed, onion rings, sautéed mushrooms, asparagus and mac and cheese. All of it was amazing.   Here is my tip: if you're getting a salad, share it. Get the half order of sides so you can try multiple.   And yes, when the waiter suggests the butter cake for dessert, oblige."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with the family to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing. This is my second time to City Hall and we will definitely be back! The service is outstanding and they do a great job accommodating and helping you make your way around the menu, etc. We started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu; a cherry lemon drop. It was delicious and the presentation was great, too. It comes out similar to the seafood tower and is so cold the drink bubbles when they put it in the glass. Very cool. We got the seafood tower where they will give you almost any number you like for each option, which is certainly helpful when you have a table of people who can't decide!   For the meal we got a variety of their steaks: ribeye, porterhouse, KC strip and all were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Absolutely delicious! Our family is in the meat business and my dad said it was one of the best steaks he had ever had. We shared the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing!) and some mushrooms. All in all it was a great place to have a celebration!"}
{"text":"It was a night of over indulgence.  Started off with shrimp cocktail which was as expected.  Also had Alaskan King Crab Stuffed Mushrooms which were tasty.  However, we reached out and ordered the bone marrow. Wow. A delicacy for certain.  The lobster bisque was perfect.  The rack of lamb was prepared perfectly and served sizzling on a hot plate.  The flavor was good but not as good as I was anticipating.  The chef's cut NY strip was great.  Charred and cooked perfectly.  Of course the lobster mashed potatoes are on point! The creamed spinach is not too shabby either.  The desserts were off the chart.  The butter cake is stellar and the cherry cobbler divine.  Don't forget your credit card however!"}
{"text":"This our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  The restaurant décor is amazing.  The bone in filet is over the top!  They Buttercake is a must!!  This restaurant is a no brainer!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate mine and my bfs 3rd anniversary and I'm speechless! The night is introduced with valet parking, followed by the amazing building and decorations. The staff if so caring and polite, accommodating everything I asked for. What won me over was also the fact that I walked in about 20 minutes before they closed, and they still seated us and didn't rush us one bit! The waiter and hostess gave us their recommendations and I ordered exactly that, let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all!!! We got the petite filet and it was to die for! And I had made a special request in the beginning while my bf walked outside for a couple mins, and asked if we could get a dessert with a \"happy anniversary\" note. And they did phenomenal! And the music choices, was great! My favorite was ain't no sunshine! I recommend this place for sure!!! 10/10 bravo"}
{"text":"You spent the afternoon day drinking when you should have stayed home and done your laundry. Now you're going to pay the price.  Mastro's offers a unique dining experience rivaled by few restaurants with its over the top food, ambiance, and service.  In fact, I doubt few can take exception with any aspect of this fine establishment.  It's simply that good.  If what you're seeking is a place where you can dress to the nines, be seen by Scottsdale's elite, frittering the night away in elegant surroundings, Mastro's is the place for you. A steak is around fifty bucks, a potato eleven, but in its defense, it is a one-pound spud that'll feed the entire table. Other notables were the lobster bisque, chopped salad, grilled buttered brussels sprouts, and scalloped potatoes.   Steaks are normal sized and easy to wolf. The ahi is thinly sliced and layered, presented in the size and shape of the entire fish. In a word, huge. This entree will feed two adults handily.   As mentioned, all of us were burnt crispy from an afternoon of prodigious day-drinking, making cocktails, wine, and aperitifs forbidden. The portions of starters were big enough to feed the Cardinal's front line, making dessert out of the question too. In fact, now that I think about it, I have no idea why we came here. Everyone was tired, grumpy, and ready for bed before the server even introduced herself. And, since I didn't stay home to do my laundry like I should have, I found myself wearing an old pair of ill-fitting jeans (tight would be an understatement) that squeezed my guts so badly, I could have leveled the entire scene with a lone weapons-grade fart sortie.   Four hundred bucks for an elegant evening of food I wasn't in the mood for, people watching I could have done without, and a drive home that'd make Jack Kerouac's journey seem like a jaunt out to the mailbox; this as I squeezed back a stomach full  of angry heaters the entire ride.   I'll be back, but next time it won't be because it was the only place we could locate  with early enough reservations to insure none of us passed out in our salads."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place forever and finally got to go this weekend and it was awesome.  This is the kind of restaurant where I am happy to spend the money on  great meal with great service. We started with the wedge salad and french onion soup and a couple glasses of wine. The wedge is always so funny to me because its so basic and you don't think its anything special until you eat it and see how awesome the simple food is. The french onion had great flavor throughout.   For entrees we had the pepper New York strip, rib eye, and bone in filet. We had the green beans, twice baked potato and garlic mash as our sides. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. The service was spot on in that we always had our water filled and our cute waitress was attentive enough with out bugging us.   Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert although I hear I now need to go back for the butter cake. If I had known that before, I would have made room for dessert.   Even though I will be eating ramen noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner for the next week after this meal, it was very much worth it and I hope I can go back again soon."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my guy and it was such an amazing night. This was our first experience at a Mastro's restaurant, so we didn't know what to expect.The service was top-notch from start to finish. I truly felt taken care of throughout the entire evening.   I started off with the Dream Berry martini, which was delicious. I love that they leave the shaker with the second serving of your beverage on the table. The bread and butter was also great; we had to keep ourselves from eating too much of it before the main course. We split the caesar salad which was also good and had delicious croutons.  I ordered the petite filet with a lobster tail and the Alaskan King Crab black truffle gnocchi for my side. One of the specials was the black truffle butter that you can get for your steak, which I ordered as well. My bf had the NY strip and the garlic mashed potatoes for his side.   Everything was cooked to perfection. My filet was the best I've ever had and the lobster was buttery and tender. The truffle butter and gnocchi were both divine. My bf thoroughly enjoyed his steak as well and raved about the potatoes.  We finished our evening with their famous butter cake. This in my opinion could've used more sauce and fruit to offset the heaviness of the cake. But overall it was still very tasty. Mastro's won us over with it's wonderful service and food. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Hands Down, the BEST bone-in Ribeye I have ever had.  I don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu when I dine here.  It's just THAT good!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal and experience. Everything about this place was beyond expectations. Wine list is exceptional."}
{"text":"Yes, its pricey but so worth every bit of it.   rack of lamb is amazing.  never do I eat lamb but I have the last four times I went.   Fabulous martinis and great oyster selections.  Be sure to tell them no pepper on the Oysters...why they do that, who knows but they do.  Good oysters need no spices. Its really not a place for children but my 5 year old enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I always get annoyed when nicer restaurants don't serve fountain drinks. I don't want a goddamn metal bottle of diet coke; I want a bottomless glass of watery addiction. That being said, this Mastros was a bastion of familiarity for this Angelo traveling to Scottsdale. Chagrined that although nominal hours are until 1 am, the kitchen closes quite a bit earlier. At least they still served us the warm butter cake."}
{"text":"Someone recommended us to come here and we were excited to come, but left disappointed!  I ordered the pepper steak and it was ok, nothing special.  My friend ordered the seabass and it was very dry and flavorless.  Another friend ordered the herb crusted chicken which was great.  Funny that you come to s a steak house and the only thing good was the chicken.  To spend over $100 per person I expect perfection and got mediocre!!!  I will not recommend.  I'm giving it 3stars instead of 1 only because our server was friendly and they had a two person band singing for entertainment."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection!! I was happy to see French Bordeaux on the wine list. Not many restaurants carry international wines.  The steaks we ordered were prepared very well, and the 400 degree plates had a certain je ne sais quios. We tried the Lobster Mash Potatoes, and they were the perfect accompaniment. Dessert is to die for! The Warm Butter Cake and Pecan Pie were huge, and soooo dang divine. The service was wonderful. An overall memorable dining experience.  I had to add to my review. The restaurant called after our reservation for a follow up on our experience at Mastro's. This restaurant just went above and beyond our expectations. We already have future reservations with out of town guests."}
{"text":"Wow. Went here with my wife's work (the boss man was buying, thank god) and we had a tremendous meal. After a round a drinks, the boss man orders up the seafood tower. I have never seen anything like this. The thing is huge. I devoured clams and shrimp and lobster to my hearts content and there were plenty left over when we were finished. We had to egg the other diners on to get them to eat some of this stuff, there was just so much.   Then the salads come out. Pretty standard fare.   Then the steaks....Oh. My. Lordy. I do not believe I have had a better steak in my life. Everything was cooked to perfection. Throw in several table sides (all delicious) and I was starting to get really full. We had moved onto wine at this point, and we all started to get a little raucous.   Then came dessert: NOOOO NOT DESSERT! Yes dessert. Again, everything was absolutely delicious and I could not find fault with anything they brought to our rather large group.   As soon as we got in the car, I had to loosen my belt and undo the button on my pants. Top to bottom, one of the single greatest meals of my life.....just thank God I wasn't paying for it....."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Service was great. Food, Amazing.  Seafood tower is a must. Sides, again great.  A little loud on the loud side, But hey its it's a trendy upscale restaurant in Scottsdale.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"my opinion a huge ripoff  small filet was $60 a potato side was $16 a veggie side was  $15  The steak was dry even med rare Ruths Chris is much better quality and value  I heard Mastros chain sold years ago for a huge price $250 million so I guess new owners have jacked up prices. I am native NYC and have eaten at every major steak house east and west This place sucks"}
{"text":"(This is copied and pasted over from the old \"Drinkwater's City Hall\", as they're now under operation by Mastro's City Hall)  We LOOOOOOVE this steakhouse. The service isn't over the top like I'd expect, but I really do love the steaks. It's so tender and wonderful, and absolutely the most fabulous presentation... the plates are pre-warmed, and OH! the bread and ohmygodit'sjustsoeffinggood...  I just exploded a little. You get the picture."}
{"text":"After a long weekend of work, this was a nice way to finish it all off.  I ordered a 24oz Porterhouse, ceaser salad and we all got the family style au gratin potaoes and mac and cheese. Lets start with the bread that was offered up when we sat down. Excellent! The pretzel bread was very different and unexpected. The ceaser was next which also was excellent, I know its hard to make a bad ceaser, but I've seen it done. Next was the porterhouse, medium rare plus (they have inbetweens of the normal cooked selections). Wow is all I can say. It was the best steak I've had in a while. Cooked perfectly and the filet side was melt in your mouth. The 2 cheesy sides were very good as well, but if I had to complain about something I'd have to say too much cheese. After they had cooled down a bit, the cheese just kind of formed into a great big mass and was pretty unappetizing.  I also need to mention the waiter. He knew the menu like he had written it himself and could tell us the ingredients of every dish we asked about. He was pretty amazing. The 2nd waiter who came by to scrape the crumbs off the table was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Something has changed at this place. Service has dropped and pricing raised. Very sad as I have been coming here for 15 years and was at one point my favorite restaurant. I hope they fix it."}
{"text":"What else can you give this elegant, and mouth watering food and restaurant. We have had their steaks and their seafood tower and fish and just thinking about them makes me hungry. You must celebrate your birthday here at least once. You deserve it. Exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"Mastro's City Hall is one of the best steakhouses in Scottsdale.  The Classic steakhouse setting with Red Leather booths and tables.  Lounge and Main Dining and some nice music to go along with excellent service, nice wine list, and an fantastic display of meat.  The Bone In Filet is the most common choice but you can never go wrong with the Strip.  All of the appetizers that we tried were prepared perfectly and our waiter was at our beck and call.  If your looking for a nice date place to really set the mood City Hall can take you there."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the state of Arizona, the food, the staff, the decor, this is the total package! The best also comes with a price you can expect from the best, but you dont eat here every night. Treat yourself, whether its boys night out, a special occasion, or you just so happen to be in town and need a darn good meal this is the place. The bone in filet is my suggestion as rarely in life does one come across a bone in fliet. I dont know how you can save room for dessert, so just force it down, its all great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Steak, seafood and desert are all top quality.  Service is excellent. Great atmosphere. Live music is a nice touch and great food you can't go wrong.  A little on the expensive side but it is well worth it. Eaten here quite a few times and have never left feeling disappointed.  Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The GF had been raving about this place for sometime now so we decided to go. I must admit, it was all she cracked it up to be. I have NEVER been to an upper high end restaurant that was so crowded you would have thought you were at a TGI Fridays. That just says one thing. The food is AWESOME along with excellent service. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to be undoubtedly satisfied when spending at least $200.00 for two!"}
{"text":"My first time here was about 3 years ago for my friends 21st birthday and it was amazing. His time I came with my fiancé and again amazing!!! We got the West African prawn (yes just 1 ginormous prawn) for an appetizer to share and it was delicious, though I think it was a special item not on their regular menu. My fiancé got the porter house and that was massive as well, and I got a filet. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection  The steaks come out on piping hot plates, be careful not to touch them, and the servers will scoop out your chosen sides and they sizzle as they hit the plate. The manager came to our table after taking a few bites to make sure everything was cooked well and it I was proud to say EVERYTHING was perfect! I'm not sure if he was going around to every table or just a few, but it was a nice touch that really made us feel as feel that they were taking care of us and really appreciate us eating here.  We ordered the butter cake for dessert-their signature dessert item-and it too was delicious, and again huge! We ate so much of our meal though that we couldn't eat all the cake, and they were super nice about boxing it up! We ate it the next day straight out of the fridge, and it's so good cold too!!  This is our go to place for a nice going out dinner date. Seriously best steaks in town"}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT! My boyfriend and I just went there because we wanted a good steak, we didn't really look at prices or anything before going which we thought was unfortunate because it was a little out of our price range and we were underdressed.  But the prices definitely matched the quality of Mastro's.  We shared the most delicious 20oz NY sirloin and gorgonzola mac and cheese.  It was the best meal we've had in a while. Not only that, they have the most wonderful staff.  After our delicious steak and mac and cheese, they topped off our amazing dinner and gave us a free warm butter cake dessert! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone planning a special night.  It is a perfect date night restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a juicy steak and good wine. you definitely won't be disappointed. The sides are pretty amazing as well. They serve family style side that are good portions and a great way to try different things. All was wonderful great service friendly staff. If you go at night you will need your flash light on your phone in order to read the menu it's really that dark. I seriously didn't even need to wear my makeup. Definitely a must try if your a steak lover."}
{"text":"Best steak place in Phoenix hands down. Very consistent food and service. It can be a bit noisy though! Still, the steaks are amazing so, it's worth a bit of noise."}
{"text":"This place has modern flair but a timeless, throwback atmosphere. Does that make sense?  I doubt it. Just go here. The service, the steaks, the wine will leave you searching for words to do it justice on your own yelp review."}
{"text":"Great place to be on a Friday night. We sat in the lounge area, next to the bar, and danced to the sounds provided by the live band. The food was top notch however, I did order the house special ( Ono Fish) that came out way under cooked. The waiter claimed he put on the ticket that I had asked for it to be cooked medium, but he took the blame and said he wrote it in error.  I have ordered fish many times and have never ever order it medium.  Non the less the manager came out and took it off our bill. The rest of the food was AMAZING!  Crab mash potatoes Rack of Lamb Mac & Cheese The butter cake with ice cream was to die for!!    We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"went there once while on a business trip... so glad that the host made this wonderful choice! it's as good as the Mastro's in Beverly Hills... everything is just perfect - the decorations, the services, of course, the steak!  loved their apple martini especially!   definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went out for dinner on a Thursday night, football and live music! What a wonderful way to spend my evening. The atmosphere is amazing and the music was great!  I had the special which was the tomahawk steak...best steak I've had in the valley. It was cooked to perfection!  Being a hard core chocolate lover, I had to try the chocolate sin cake for dessert and it was delicious, not too rich or overpowering.  Of course the service was  up to par and the entire dining experience was everything  I expected."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here since I was craving a real good steak. Reservations were for a Friday night during AZ season (busy season). Valet was quick and prompt which I liked. Walking into the place, it was PACKED. I figured this was going to be the case, which is why I made reservations. We were not sat immediately, however we didn't mind and decided to get a drink at the bar.   Once sat, we were given an entire sh-peel. Our server was very knowledgeable, but seemed a little rushed. Wasn't alarming so I didn't mind it. My partner and I started off with some oysters Rockefeller. They were pretty good and better than some of the other places I have had them at. For the main course, we ordered the bone in filet's and side of 4 mac and cheese. I ordered a cool blue rare and found it a little more on the red rare side (some of you steak eaters might know what I mean). It wasn't a big deal, as long as it was rare haha. Wine was good and so was the service.   I enjoyed eating here and will be going back next month."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Where to start...the seafood tower.  Appetizers like the bone marrow salad (delectable).  the gorgonzola mac & cheese.  Lobster mashed potatoes The selection of steaks.  The wine selection.  The butter cake.  The service is great, and they are very accommodating for groups--my company has had their holiday party there for several years in a row.  Highly recommended as one of the best steakhouses in the Valley, maybe in the nation, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse EVER!  Love everything I've ever ordered at Mastros - including steak, lobster, chicken, mac and cheese, potatoes, salad, butter cake, wine......The service is 5 star as well.  I go to Scottsdale a few times a year and always make a point to eat here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been a regular City Hall customer for years.  I love going to this place... great drinks (really strong!), great food (the lobster mash potatoes!) and great environment!  But two weeks ago, my friend and I had a super poor experience.  We sat at the bar and the new female bartender was not friendly, didn't smile... and didn't check on us.  OK... not the end of the world but the my bone-in rib-eye was cold.  It was supposed to be placed on a hot plate, not a cold plate.  So I sent it back... and what they gave me was a over cooked piece of meat.  Total bummer.  For a $55 steak... I expect them to bring their \"A\" game.  Between a unfriendly staff and poor tasting food... it's hard to want to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best steak in the valley, period.   I've been here quite a few times and every single time it pushes the bar even higher for me. The bone-in filet is the probably the best thing I've ever ate. The lobster mash potatoes are phenomenal, as is the gorgonzola mac n cheese.   There really isn't anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be treated to an amazing meal at Maestro's City Hall this week.  It is certainly a classy place (still trendy and cool inside) and while the restaurant can be a bit stuffy, eating in the bar area (full service and tables) is much more lively and has a better ambiance.  The entire experience was fantastic, from the pours on the drinks, the service, to the amazing food.    I ordered the 18oz. Bone In Filet and it was amazing.  It cut like butter off the knife and the sides were awesome as well.  We had creamed spinach, lobster mashed potatoes, and an spectacular mac and cheese with a cheese I can't remember.  YUM!    Traditionally, saving the best for last, we one of the best desserts I have ever had.  It was a butter cake that I could have licked the plate on if it would have been appropriate.    Great for a romantic special dinner or an upscale business dinner.  Very cool and hip!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Med Rare bone in filet!!!!! Scotch selection is not bad as well."}
{"text":"My first suggestion when eating at mastros is SAVE ROOM FOR MORE !! the food is always PERFECT ! Steaks always cooked exactly the way i like, the cream corn & creamed spinach are my staple sides but i always end up ordering the mashed potatoes as well as extra pretzel bread . It's my first check in since I'm new to yelp but I've been loyal to mastros from AZ to CALI for years . No matter what city, the service is the same . the city hall location is my favourite only because it's home base . Our waiter Leona was so sweet and attentive and very helpful . I tried the calamari for the first time here last night and since i usually strongly dislike calamari i was shocked when i finished almost the whole plate on my own . It's simply amazing . The crab cakes and crab or shrimp cocktail always get to the table somehow but the token item the HOLY GRAIL of desserts is of course the butter cake ! like i said .. save room !!"}
{"text":"Must have: The pretzel bread. (I'm a philly girl so its hard to find good pretzels in AZ). The shrimp cocktail...its \"only\" 3 shrimps but they are big enough to cut each into 3-4 big bite sizes. I love torturing myself with the horseradish. It hurts so good. The seared scallops. Best Ive had. Tuna Tartar. Delish with a little bite to it. Spicy Mambo salad (with a wasabi horseradish dressing) I have been craving it non stop. Of course the Petite filet is a no brainer. Ordering a martini? You get 2 martinis in that order so that price is not too bad."}
{"text":"$19 for a mediocre martini!! Wow.  No need for the bathroom attendant.  Could use a few more bartenders."}
{"text":"The steak is always spot on. This last visit I had the lamb. Outstanding! In amount and in taste. I got a side order of the mushrooms and sautéed brussel sprouts. A glass of pinot noir and I was in heaven."}
{"text":"Was there with 9 others Sat nt. Fabulous delicious steak, potatoes, fresh fish tower. Drank wine from Lodi Ca, delicious"}
{"text":"Yes! This is what every fancy restaurant should be like.   The service was AMAZING! From the waiter's sexy voice to the side dishes arriving at the same time, and hand served by the staff. Impressed! Now that's getting what you pay for.   The food was delish, I had the bone in steak, the chef special, \"rubbed with 27 different spices\" and yes he/she rubbed it well. LOL  For desert we shared \"Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake\" this cake was pure insanity, it came with hand whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  I can't comment on price because my boss treated his staff to this glorious dinner. I'm sure he would say it was well worth it :)"}
{"text":"We had an incredible experience during dinner. We had Bobby as a server. Do yourself a favor and ask for him when you make your next reservation. He was attentive without being intrusive, handled all issues promptly and efficiently, and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Although my steak was overcooked, they immediately made that right.   My only criticism is their cocktails. We paid $20 for a standard Manhattan that was served shaken rather than stirred as it should have been. As a result, the the balance of my drink was watered down. Standard spirits were utilized, so the $20 price made no sense. In addition, the drink was served with a standard maraschino rather than a Luxardo cherry, which was disappointing considering they have the Luxardos on hand for other cocktails.   That said, we'll definitely return but will just stick to wine with dinner. Try the lobster mashed potatoes... They're amazing."}
{"text":"Had the lamb chops and they came with eight ribs and some of the best I've had.  Highly recommend them.  For desert the butter cake is a must try."}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  Top notch food and service.  Tough to make a decision on which cut of beef to get, but you can't go wrong.  Must have lobster mash, well worth it.  Bring. Huge appetite because you will be eating like a King!  Bar area is super lively and make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Mastro's City Hall while on vacation in Scottsdale. We had a wonderful dinner with exquisite service. I dine out all over the country and I can say without hesitation that this was right up there with the finest I can recall. The steak was superb and the salmon was fantastic. We were both extremely satisfied with our experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am very upset with my last visit. I asked them to bring out a cake as a surprise because we were celebrating 20 years of friendship and they told me they would do it and I even called to confirm the day before and they said they had it written down and would take care of it. They forgot to bring the cake out! It never happened and I was very upset. Also, my wife ordered the 6 ounce filet and when it came out it looked like it was a two ounce filet. Someone by the name of Andy called me the next day to see how everything went and I told him my concerns. He said he would have a manager call me and here we are a week later and no call from anyone. For having a bill of $500 this is not the experience I was hoping for! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife was treating me to a belated dinner gift and I selected Mastros. I made the right decision, as this is definitely a \"special occasion\" restaurant! The ambiance is elegant and sophisticated, but the low lighting takes some adjustment or the help of a flashlight app. The service was friendly, professional and excellent. The wine prices tend to be on the high side but the \"by the glass\" pours are generous. The food is also expensive but the quality is outstanding, the portions generous, and the sides are definitely sized to share. Leave room for justifiably famous the butter cake! If you come prepared to spend $$$$, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here. I am not one for chain restaurants, but this is great quality all the way around. Food is outstanding, service is friendly and attentive. I give these servers kudos for keeping the quality up in a high-volume restaurant. Lobster Mashed Potatoes are the BEST. You can't go wrong with the steaks, obviously. Great Wedge Salad as well. 5 stars baby!"}
{"text":"I went here recently with a party of about 15 for a work-related dinner.  The service was mediocre, the dining area is always very loud, and the food was not the quality I have had there in the past.  There were multiple people serving our table but they still couldn't manage to follow through with drink orders or clear the table of dishes and unused wine glasses.  They over-cooked my steak and my colleague's steak.  I asked the server to just box up the steak since we would be onto dessert by the time it would be ready.  The funny thing is that my boss also asked for his steak to be boxed up but when he got home all he found was mashed potatoes, ha!  Maybe it was just a bad night?  I've been there before and always had a good experience."}
{"text":"*Credit Card Fraud* Less than 12 hours after eating at Mastro's we received 4 ridiculous charges from online businesses. $800 here, $1,000 there....luckily the credit card company blocked them all. But I don't think it's a coincidence."}
{"text":"It was a business event. Dinner was good overall. Steak was definitely my favorite - Yes, Mastro's still have it! Ambiance...it's too busy (loudness) for me. I understand it's a steak house, but it's just not for me.  No complains, but being envious of the business model here.  Of course, I would come back for steak-dinner events. As for my personal taste, I preferred (great) steak-house like Donavan's or Steak 44 or Capital Grille or Preston's ...a little nicer / classier ambiance.  Until next time...but at the mean time, Have a blast at Mastro's. Kudos and Happy Dining !"}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here. First, the service alone is worth 5 stars. Really rare to find this top notch service. Ate outdoors next to the giant fireplace, which was great as it was Christmas. Prime rib, lobster tail, scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, strawberry mule. I haven't had a meal like this in a long time. All the food and drink was top of the line. It's been almost a month and we still talk about the perfect experience. This is the level of quality you really don't find much these days. Inside seemed crowded and loud, so if your looking for something more intimate, definitely reserve a spot on the patio."}
{"text":"Mastros is my favorite! Steak, lobster mashed potatoes, dream berry martini, fun bar to sit in and listen to music. Great oysters. Amazing wine list. And of course the butter cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Okay, this Mastro's is meh, 2 stars. Sis and I have eaten as Mastro's Beverly Hills for decades and I thought this was a safe choice for Xmas eve. It was predictably crowded, we were seated promptly, but we waited almost too long for our food. Then when my sister's monstrous rib eye came out, she found it overcooked. So much for medium rare having a warm center, this steak was medium, which sis hates. The waiter apologized and took it back to bring out another. My bf's filet was more medium than the medium rare he ordered, but he is loathe to complain and ate it anyway. The broccoli was a tad past al dente and the snap peas were cooked to a mushy consistency. Yikes. When sis asked for boxes for the left overs (some were for the dog) the busboy balked at putting things in separate boxes. WTF? I realize this is not Beverly Hills, however the prices are the same, but the quality is definitely not there. If you're used to good steakhouses like Fleming's where they know how to cook a steak correctly, then you'll be disappointed in Mastro's City Hall, I know I was."}
{"text":"Outstanding on all fronts. The food, the service, the amazing drinks, as well as the atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ask for Corell  and let him walk you through the most amazing dinning experience ever !!!!! And the GM Jess ... Most professional ... Make sure to say hi  Thank you !!!!!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to write this update, but it had to be done. My last 2 experiences at City Hall were so below average that I will not be returning there. The last visit was in June (I apologize for being late on the update) and I ordered the heirloom tomato and mozzarella appetizer, but the tomatoes had mold on them. I actually ate one, before I noticed something tasted wrong. When we shined a light over it we could see large fuzzy black and green spots. We told the waitress and she said \"oh, do you want another one.\" Obviously, my appetite was not in the mood to have more tomatoes. She sent over one of the Managers and he asked if we had another on the way and we said no, he said \"oh, well we will make sure that doesn't happen again\"... Um, really, that's your response? No apology, no offering of a free round on them, nothing. Next the main courses came out, and for the first time at City Hall, the steaks were cooked incorrectly. We ordered the steak medium rare and they came out well. I was over the meal at this point. As we were waiting for our bill, a different manager came over and asked about our experience. We let him know we were very dissatisfied and excited to be leaving. He was much more upset by what we told him, more so than either the waitress or the other manager we spoke to. He offered us a second glass of wine and did apologize to us. He was the only good part of the experience that night. I will likely eat at Mastro's again, but I will not return to City Hall. I suppose, I will stick to the one on Pinnacle Peak."}
{"text":"If you like your steak medium well order it medium..  besides that it was nice, and the live music was surprisingly hip"}
{"text":"First and for-most... Thank You Georgeann's dad! Probably collest guy ever! He took us all out to the most amazing dinner ever here!   Everything we had was amazing! We first started off with the seafood tower that was insane! Oysters, crab, shrimp oh my! We then all ordered what cut of steak we wanted, and the most delicious sides ever. Crab stuffed mashed potatoes, need I say more? I finally understand the meaning of \"melt in your mouth good!\" My mouth is watering as I write this.   I may never have the opportunity to go back, but I want to make sure to recommend City Hall, to anyone and everyone that is looking for a fantastic meal that is gonna cost you a bit. More than worth it!"}
{"text":"bone in filet with creamed corn and mac n cheese....orgasmic"}
{"text":"When ordering medium well steak, it should not be blue on the inside. After cutting the steak I noticed how undercooked it was. Returned the steak and 10 minutes later got the same steak back in pieces. Everyone else was finishing. Not going back. I was told the kitchen was slammed. When I got the bill  the prices were still the same. I think I should have payed for slammed prices."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  City Hall is discreetly tucked away in a non-descript office building but once you walk in, you are in a classic and very attractive East Coast style steakhouse.  You can choose to sit in the very lively bar area or in the more formal dining room.  We opted for the bar.  Service is fast and attentive by white-jacketed waiters.  An excellent pricey wine list, as you would expect.  We ordered the ahi tuna tartare as a starter.  It came in a three layer tower: puffed rice, avocado and the tuna on top.  Delicious.  My wife had the pepper steak and I ordered the bone-in ribeye, rare.  The food came out very quickly and the steaks were exactly how we wanted them.  The meat was superb.  When you put aside the booming Sinatra, the New York affectations, the white-jacketed waiters and the over-sized portions, what you're left with is the meat, which is the reason you came here in the first place.  This was perfectly aged and cooked meat.   We ordered a potatoes au gratin on the side and I have to agree with the other reviewer here - there was really a bit too much cheese.  I mean, I'm all for excess - especially in a steakhouse - but enough with the cheese already guys.  A very minor quibble, however.  We were unable to eat more than half the meal and the leftovers were professionally packaged up to take home in a giant over-sized Maestro's bag.  Pretty much everyone leaves here with one of these.  All in all, a perfect dinner on every score.  Get your paper out though because all this bombast and cholesterol doesn't come cheap.    Recommended when you're in the mood for this sort of thing."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful.   The dungeness crab cocktail was plentiful but did not taste fresh. The lobster bisque was out of this world good.   My steak was prepared just as I'd ordered but it lacked flavor.  I took it home and ate it the next morning and it was still so-so.  I was with a large group and everyone else loved their steaks.  Maybe it was just my taste buds.  I'd just been to Ruth Chris Steak about 5 nights prior and that steak was incredible.  Due to the high cost I doubt I'd go back simply because there is a lot of competition."}
{"text":"I am truly disappointed in this experience.. I have heard so many amazing things about Mastro's and how their steak so amazing and perfect.  I was surprised that my experience was a complete opposite of the things I heard.  It's very nice when you walk in and the hostess are very nice.  We made a reservation in the lounge not knowing how loud it would be.  Squeezed into a tiny booth in the corner we sat down and realized how far we were when facing eachother but oddly enough how close we were to the next table.  5 mins pass.. no server, no one to ask us if we wanted water, 10 mins finally someone comes with no introduction just sticking the menu in our faces like, HERE, ORDER.  So.. at this point I felt uncomforable going to a place for my boyfriends birthday that didnt really seem to want us here.  We looked over the menu, everything, of course, al la carte, I was warned of the prices already.  We ordered a bone in rib eye, bone in filet, and lobster mashed potatoes.  Food took a long time to arrive.  Bone in rib eye-  Right when my steak came I could tell it was overcooked because medium rare is not hard to touch,  I was reluctant to send it back because I was so hungry and I didn't want to be a bother but my boyfriend assured me that if we're going to pay over $50 for a steak it should be perfect. My steak had become well done after we were able to flag a waiter down.  Brought me a new one and right away it was well done again....... also the waitress shined a brightlight at me and told me please cut down the middle so we can see.  At this point I felt so awkward, I didn't ask to change the steak because I don't want to be so difficult TWICE.  Overall the flavor was really good but overcooked.   Bone in filet-  My boyfriend ordered a medium rare as well and it was also overcooked but only to medium.  Because a filet is such a good cut of meat he didn't exchange it cause it was still enjoyable.  I have got to say this was the best piece of filet I have every eaten.    Lobster mashed potatoes- This was packed with flavor and chunks and chunks of lobster, really amazing.  No wonder its more than $30 bucks.    We ordered coffee so we wouldnt be coma induced from all our food, really really good coffee.  Since it was my boyfriends birthday they brought out a cake which was very nice.    So from feeling bad about sending my steak back my boyfriend and I both told our waitress thank you for sending it back.. we really appreciate it.. not only did she not acknowledge us she rolled her eyes.  Like WOW I'm sorry I want some quality for the 200 bucks I spent.  I really never had such bad service at a high end resturant.  Honestly.. I'm not sure how I feel about this place yet, the filet was REALLY good but the service threw off the experience.  And if this is a steak house.. they should really perfect medium rare."}
{"text":"Classically elegant steakhouse with very good service, excellent steaks, great wine list and desserts.  Waiters seemed to rush us a bit, but the service was not lacking.  Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and the service were impeccable. Our party of 6 scored seating on the patio, which was not as loud as the interior dining room. We enjoyed our beverages and were then treated to a seafood feast with the Seafood Tower.  I especially liked the shrimp and crab.  We had the steak, salmon and salads and everyone raved about their entree. We shared mushrooms, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and best of all, the lobster mashed potatoes. We celebrated a birthday and were treated to the amazing butter cake."}
{"text":"Pretty spendy, but the steak was certainly well worth the price.  I had the Kansas City cut -- the very best steak I can recall having.  For side dishes we had green beans, Brussels sprouts, and lobster mashed potatoes.  The lobster mash was completely unnecessary and over the top --way too much food for even four hungry guys.  (It tasted ok, but could have, should have, been a meal all by itself.)  We also ordered two bisques and two salads"}
{"text":"We went to Mastro's City Hall for my daughter's birthday on a Saturday night. They have valet parking but you can park yourself in the back which isn't too far of a walk.   The place is fairly dark with the bar all lit up in red with a live band playing. At first our party of nine was seated in the bar area but we couldn't even hear the person next to us. Couldn't even hear our waitress telling about the specials that night either. Band was playing pretty loud. We requested to be moved into the dining room which was more quiet but I know our waitress wasn't too happy to see us move. Seriously it's was a way too loud to enjoy a birthday dinner.   Anyways, we started off with their bread basket. The pretzel bread was really good. All the other breads were okay but the pretzel bread was the star of the basket.    Next, we had the Warm Spinach Salad and the Mastro's House Salad. The warm Spinach salad was actually warm Spinach with bacon and blue cheese. This was really good and I liked it a lot. As for the house salad, it had iceberg lettuce, huge shrimp, and nice big pieces of crab. It was good too but for some reason I really liked the Warm Spinach Salad the best.   I shared the special of the night with my daughter. We had the Tomahawk which was a 38oz Australian ribeye that had a 12oz bone. Mastro's is known for their bone-in steaks. So we tried it. It was good. Cooked perfectly. Nice and juicy. Didn't think it was great but good.   We got the sides of lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese, roasted Brussel sprouts, and green beans with sliced almonds. The lobster mash was really good with huge chunks of lobster. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was okay. Nothing special to me. Really like the roasted Brussel sprouts and the green beans. Both were cooked perfectly.   My wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and it was moist but a little dry on a few bites (if that makes sense). It was good and my wife enjoyed it.   My mom ordered the lamb chops. Some of the chops were under cooked but she ate the others and was going to take them home for another time. We told someone to wrap it up but for some reason it never came back. We told our waiter and he went in the back and couldn't find it so he had the kitchen cook up a whole another rack of Lamb to take home. That was pretty cool and nice of them.   My daughter got a birthday Chocolate Sin cake and we also ordered the Key Lime pie. The chocolate cake was so good and so was the key lime pie. Really good desserts.   So the service was outstanding. Our server was always watching over us. Our water cups were alway refilled and our plates were taken away appropriately. The food was good but honestly I enjoyed their sister restaurant Mastro's Ocean Club better. As for the ambiance, like I said before the bar area is way too loud. The band was okay not great. We enjoyed the dining room better. One other thing, they have bathroom attendance so bring cash when you go to the restrooms.   Beside changing our table because of the loudness and losing our leftovers, we enjoyed our meal. It was pretty good. Nice birthday dinner. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's City Hall for our anniversary last weekend. The serving staff did amazing at dancing around each other without having Issues. My husband and I commented that it was almost like they had eyes on every table as there was never a moment where our glasses were empty or our food was not at our table.  Bone-in Filet was told to us as the specialty and I am so glad I listened. The steak was able to cut with only a fork and melted in my mouth.  Our server was kind enough to share the insider knowledge...you can get half sides and share. As we left our only issue was the lighting being a touch too dark. Otherwise my husband and I both commented this was the best food we had EVER eaten!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times through the years on my visits to Scottsdale and usually had decent luck - but no more. The food is generally good, albeit a bit overpriced -but you expect that to some degree when you walk through the door given the top level service you expect to receive. I have had experiences with having to send steaks back some times, but they usually do the right thing and everyone is happy at the end of the evening.   Then there was the last time I visited. Started innocently by making a reservation for 2 via OpenTable for 845 on a Saturday night. Was out all day playing golf and got a voice message confirming my reservation \"for the bar.\" Quickly call them and tell them the reason I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance was to avoid getting stuck in a noisy bar. Told that the online form was clear it was for the bar (later verified completely false). After some back and forth told they would take care of it.   Show up on time and meet the Barbie Dolls they have working the front desk. Attitude is an understatement. I am informed they are ready to seat me at the bar - go through the same song and dance. Then told I have to wait 45-60 minutes if we want to sit in the restaurant (and hear ourselves talk). I am pretty hot at this point and my African- American friend decides to try to play peacemaker and talks to the \"hostess\" personally. She eventually starts crying and tells her manager he spit in her face. A complete fabrication - I am standing literally 2 feet from this conversation - he was the calm one. It is sobering to see such racism up close and in person (and I am no bleeding heart liberal). To their credit the manager (the second one we asked for) diagnoses the situation and steps in and magically a table in the dining room is available within 5 minutes. Why can't people do the right thing the first time?   The steaks were good, not great. The waiter was very attentive. The wine good as well (the previous time they were out of the first three wines I ordered). Dinner for 2 and dessert with tip about $500 (I don't take things out on the wait staff) - but somehow the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, particularly with that tab). I think we will find a new steak place the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Food took an hour.  4 of 8 of the steaks were the wrong temperature.  Way over priced."}
{"text":"The food is always very good, but can I take my last bite before the waiter takes my plate away without even asking me if I am done? He did that with my appetizer, bread AND my salad. I don't appreciate being rushed and disregarded and will happily go somewhere else. I do love Mastro's CH, but there are plenty of great restaurants in PHX!"}
{"text":"Great bone in ribeye.  Remember sides can be ordered as half orders. Tammy was awesome!"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Mastro's! Fabulous service and wonderful, fresh food. It's always predictable there. We loved our caviar, seafood platter, various vegetable sides, lobster and steaks. They bent over backward to accommodate us, as usual. Always a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively my FAVORITE Mastro's EVER (and I LOVE Mastro's).  Went there for dinner unexpectedly while in town for a funeral---they were very accommodating, even though we changed our reservation 3 times (first, the time changed twice, then we had more guests than originally anticipated).  They were totally OK with that.  The server--Lauren, was HANDS DOWN the absolute best in the business.  We are accustomed to nice restaurants and as such, recognize quality service when we see it, but Lauren was over the top amazing.  As always, the food was perfect, the only problem being that there was too much of it!   Imagine my surprise when they brought out chocolate (my fave) cake with happy birthday written on the plate ( a week early).   We rarely have dessert, but under the circumstances, had to try it and it was delectable as well.  This Mastro's is a far cry from the really crappy experience we had at the Malibu Mastro's.  I almost swore off my favorite restaurant because of the management there, but thankfully, Lauren and the crew in Scottsdale has renewed my faith in this chain.  Oh, and did I mention?  They called the next day to see how everything was---a very nice touch!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated my husbands Birthday here and everything was spectacular! The good was amazing, delicious and cooked to perfection! The mac & cheese was a hit! We had the ceased salad with chicken, chicken entrée and sea bass with asparagus. And the best was the butter cake with ice cream for dessert. Our waitress was so sweet and the service was perfection! Great ambiance and perfect spot for a romantic date night! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"went her last Saturday,  to celebrate a promotion.  Jay was very attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  We has a suburb dinner, I had Sea bass, cooked to perfection, with a crusty sear on the skin, partner had a steak.  Desert, we couldn't pass up the butter cake!! YUMMY  great experience!"}
{"text":"DID YALL KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST EVER MASTROS STEAKHOUSE THAT EVER OPENED? Ok, well I dont know if it's true but I'm going to believe it is because our server told us so!!! and this whole time I thought the LA one was the first...... Everything was so delish here....... salad ... steak....... ERRTHANG! *nom nom nom nom*"}
{"text":"Best dinning experience in Scottsdale! We made reservations and sat right away... Started with the bread (omg the pretzel bread is amazing)... Then we ordered the two steaks and lobster mashed potatoes (still drooling over these). We ended the night with the famous desert and were absolutely thrilled walking out... This was a special occasion and mastros makes sure to treat every dinner like a special occasion.   My favorite thing about Mastro's: the hot plates! My food never got cold!!"}
{"text":"I've been to mastros a few times hoping to be wowed, but it disappoints every time. When coming to a steakhouse, I expect my steak to be cooked perfectly. On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I both ordered our steaks medium rare and they came out differently. My steak was rare and his was medium close to being well done. On one of my previous trips, I ordered the rack of lamb and it was pretty good, but nothing special.   I really enjoy the sides, the brussel sprouts are my favorite and I get them every time I come to mastros. The lobster mashed potatoes are also a favorite as well. The side of mushrooms are just average, nothing too fancy. The butter cake is a must!! It's large enough to share if you're full from your steak.   For being in Arizona, the seafood is really good! I've had the oysters and they are delicious!! Don't be scared to try the seafood here.   Overall, the dining experience was average, not something you'd expect from a high end steak house. I feel like the service is a hit or miss; sometimes I get a really attentive server, other times my glass of water will be empty for a long period of time. The tables are also very crammed together and the entire restaurant is usually very loud and busy. Don't expect an intimate environment. I wouldn't suggest the restaurant to a friend, I'd go else where."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar.  Caviar and wine for happy hour then decided to have dinner.  The caviar is exceptionally good here and I love all the toppings to go with.  Mastro's is my favorite whether it be Dominick's, Steak 44 or City Hall."}
{"text":"First time for us at this Mastro's location, and it did not disappoint!!  The food was amazing, service was great.  Obviously it was super pricey, but for a special occasion it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Perfect steak. First time at this location and enjoy everything from the steak to the lobster mashed potatoes were incredible.  The dry ice in the cosmo is always my favorite!"}
{"text":"Alright, I went there on an evening after a 5 hour flight from Miami and just had dinner on the plane (yeah, some airlines still do that in less than Taco Bell quality).  Somebody took me there as she was super hungry, talked me into ordering a steak and promised me the band was playing cool music. Well, besides the band who was probably a bit miss guided in ther music taste, I have to admit, the food was good, and hey, the bread basket is awesome.  But, boy, is that place loud. Must be the architecture or something, but I had a hard time to entertain a normal conversation in the dining area. Please, owners, enhance this place acoustically and I will come back.  Oh, and one of the major value proposition of modern steakhouses is actually their biggest drawback. The steak is served on a freakishly hot plate, and once you applied the emergency kit band aids to your fingers, the medium rare piece of meat turned into medium well. Not good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night around nine and was sat right away. I chose the Chilean sea bass and my dinner companions chose the bone in ribeye and the new your strip. After sampling everything I would have to say the ribeye was the best. We also tried their oyster Rockefeller and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh man... this was an amazing experience. Came here for a work dinner, and the service was fantastic. First off, the elderflower martini - get it. We ordered a seafood tower with shrimp, lobster and dungeons as crab. All were delicious. I ordered a bone in filet with truffle butter that was so much better than I thought it would be. Juicy, tender, flavorful. And I've heard SO much about the butter cake... So. Good. We also ordered the chocolate covered strawberries which were great too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any steak (and seafood) lovers!"}
{"text":"A little confused. Was here on Saturday Aug. 24th and food was 5 stars, Jonathan our server was fantastic and knowledgeable. As expected! Read more for our Tueaday night trip.  We came back again on a Tuesday Aug. 27th and THE KITCHEN WAS WAY OFF! We came here after restaurant hopping and decide to share a steak, Mac n' Cheese, and Buttercake b/w 3 of us. The steak was ordered medium rare and came out mooing, half alive. The Buttercake that I rave of was overcooked and overly dense. The mac n cheese was Ah-Ma-Zing!! Bad chef night. Not what I would have expected from Mastro's.   On the upside, I lost my wallet in the bathroom and they were SO helpful in recovering it! Hours later! :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the service is excellent but for me when you spend this much money for steak you really wanted to be wowed, and my expectations fell short.  I even ordered their filet with bone-in which is what everyone tells you to get here. The meat quality was great, it just missed some seasoning or something to take it to the next level.  Actually, I enjoyed the side dishes and desert better than the steak.   This place was just ok, not great."}
{"text":"Leona was a wonderful waitress. The atmosphere was perfect. Shrimp appetizer was recommended but I was not impressed with 3 cooked shrimp, it wasn't that flavorful. My bone in ribeye was okay, but was missing flavor. I think Morton's and Pappas steakhouse will remain my number my favorites."}
{"text":"Before I get started on the food, I just need to say sit outside. The patio section is near the bar and has a charming fireplace. There is an impressive wine selection, and the cocktails are really great. I recommend the lemon drop. The presentation is really fun (they use dry ice so it looks like its smoking when it's being served). They also give you about two-two and a half drinks worth of any cocktail when you order one. Now the food. The chefs at Mastro's are definitely perfectionists. The flavors, preparations, and presentations have been flawless the three times I've eaten there. My boyfriend and I have had the fried calamari, which is great and comes with a really good savory spicy sauce. We've also had the tuna  tartare, which is prepared spicy and served with avocado. The flavor of the tuna is really enhanced and not overwhelmed by seasonings or sauces. And now the steak. It doesn't matter which one you order, because the quality of the meat is always phenomenal and the chefs prepare it to precisely what temperature you request. The sides are also excellent. We've gotten the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, the king crab gnocchi, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The gnocchi is pricey for a side, but worth EVERY penny. I would even consider getting it as a main dish if I could resist the steak! Despite all the fantastic dishes, SAVE ROOM FOR THE BUTTER CAKE. It is definitely as bad for your health as it sounds, but it is one of the most memorable and delicious desserts I've had in my life. It is definitely something you want to share with 1-3 other people. I highly recommend Mastro's city hall. Great atmosphere, amazing food and drinks, and the service is wonderful as well. Attentive and very knowledgeable wait staff."}
{"text":"Dee-licious! Great service! I would recommend this place for a birthday, Father's or Mother's Day occasion.  I loved the apple martini with dry ice."}
{"text":"OMG!  First, the martinis.  From presentation to taste these are superb!  They leave the shaker at your table and so you get a full shaker of martini.  Be sure to plan for that with a designated driver, cause you will be tipsy.  In a perfect kind of way.  Then, on to the meal.  There were 3 of us and we got 2 petite filets and split everything.  We had leftovers, even with the smallest portion on the menu!  We got the Caesar salad (the least memorable part of the meal...I would skip that next time).  Then we got grilled asparagus (oh so perfect! and $11)), the lobster mashed potatos (again, perfect...as they should be for $34!), and the steaks ($39 each).  I have this aversion to blood in my meat, so I ordered well done, which is always a challenge.  The steak they brought out was medium rare...so with many apologies they took it back and the second time it was perfect.  And by perfect I mean no red, yet moist and so tender it was like butter.  I have great appreciation for chefs that can serve meat well done and do it right, and this place delivers.  And they didn't make me feel like an idiot for liking what I like!  Even the busboy was great.  These folks know how to do it right.  Dinner was $150, not including drinks.  We don't care for wine, but their selection looked amazing."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here on the night of the Super Bowl. We were one of 4 parties dining in the dining room and we were all seated next to each other along one wall, which was a little weird. There was no live piano music, but the music was enjoyable none the less.   I had the tomato mozzarella appetizer which was excellent. Tomatoes were perfectly ripe. Cheese was soft and delicious. Balsamic vinegar perfect addition. Husband had the \"wedge\" salad. Huge chunk of iceberg lettuce (about 3/4 of a head) with a sprinkling of bacon and blue cheese. Proportions of toppings to lettuce was off, but otherwise tasted good.   For dinner, I had the 12 oz bone in filet.... most tender filet I have had. Flavor was pretty good, but I honestly prefer Houston's filet. Husband had bone-in ribeye that was well marbled, perfectly cooked and delicious. Sweet potato fries were excellent and a HUGE portion for two. Gorgonzola mac and cheese was OK, but somewhat bland and the pasta was a little past the al dente stage. For our anniversary, we were given a complimentary slice of the chocolate layer cake. This cake was so flavorful, moist and absolutely delicious. Great way to end the dinner."}
{"text":"Top 3 meals of my life.  I live in NYC and visited Scottsdale and had 0 to no expectations for this place, based on the fact that I live in NYC and am surrounded by great Steakhouses .    I was blown away.  Had the Seafood tower to start- Shrimp and Dungeness crab stole the show  Had bone in filet- unbelievably good for a filter.  Show Stopper.  Sides- Mac and cheese (4.5/5), Lobster Mashed (4/5) Creamed spinach (5/5) Brussels Sprouts (4.5/5)  Dessert- Butter Cake- very original, delicious, problem was I was so filled up from the meal couldnt fully enjoy it  Coffee- Strong and dark.  Just the way I like it.  All in all a delicious top notch meal.  If you order right, it will put a dent in your pocket but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to splurge every now and then on a good meal (preferably steak) so this year we decided to try Mastro's. I looked at previous reviews and saw that many people enjoyed it despite the price.  The hubby and I dressed up for our night out and expected everyone else to be as well.  But when we got there we noticed a few people wearing jeans,  Polo shirts,  and casual footwear. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  The dude who cleaned our table after each plate was taken was smiling as if he loved his job. I told him so as well.  He appreciated the compliment. For appetizers I ordered the oysters which were phenominal! I had them all to myself since the hubby is not a fan of them. The steak i ordered was the best I ever had!  I got the bone in cut and was very pleased with the flavor. I like a little fat on my steak. The lobster mashed potatoes was also great. We tried the butter cake but wasn't thrilled with it like other reviews. It was like eating hardened yellow cake. But overall we love, love,  loved our meal. If it wasn't so dang expensive I would go there every weekend."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Scottsdale, AZ. I go here when I have people visiting from out of town, birthdays, or a girls night out :).  My steak is always prepared perfectly well and butterflied to perfection. YUMMY?!?!?!!!! Can you say: \"Warm Butter CAKE\"? Well take a bite and you will just say WOW! I don't care for sweets but this is a must try! When ordering sides make sure you ask for light oil or butter, they soak in in the dishes but that is what makes it soooooooooooo good. Make sure you drink a lot of H20 for the sodium in the food will guarantee to get you swelling (in a good way) especially if you mix your food with a Xtra DIRTY Martini + Extra Olives.  If you are visiting or just live in AZ, this restaurant is a must-have on your BUCKET LIST.  Bon Appetite & Cheers!"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner around New Years, and we had an excellent experience. Good service and amazing food. I'm not usually a huge oyster fan but since it was J's birthday, we ordered oysters as an appetizer. Let me tell you. Best decision EVER. These were, by far, the most amazing oysters I've ever eaten. Order them, it will be the best decision you'll make that day. I had the bone-in filet which was, of course, delicious and perfect. The bf ordered Chilean Sea Bass because it was recommended by our server over his other choice of rack of lamb. I personally would always choose a steak because this is a steakhouse but he wanted something different. The sea bass was good, but not as amazing as he wanted it to be. But like I said, it's a steakhouse, you should order steak. Nonetheless, I'm fairly certain he enjoyed his meal. We also had the Lobster Mashed Potatoes which is definitely worth ordering - buttery, with large chunks of lobster, and just melt in your mouth goodness. Note that the side serving is generous, so one side is probably more than plenty for 2 people, especially if you've ordered an appetizer; between the two of us, we had a good amount of leftovers for snacking on another day. (The mashed potatoes were a lovely pre-dinner snack on New Years Day while we were recovering.)  The one negative I have to say is that I have eaten at other Maestro's that I feel have a bit of a nicer ambience - or maybe we just came on a particularly busy evening - it was loud and felt very crowded. Even though our table had plenty of room, I still felt fairly squashed. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the food, and would return here for another special occasion. I just don't expect a super intimate setting - cozy and dark, yes, but with the addition of lots of chatter from the bar, which to me, changes the ambience.  Tip: Reservations are a must for busy nights - and try to be as punctual as possible. We were running late and they said they would only hold our table for an additional 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Food , service, atmosphere where all wonderful just make sure to save room for dessert. Get the Butter Cake plenty for 2 people to share. You will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.  It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.   The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it.   The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was just not a great dining experience. And actually far from it. The service was fine, but the food was so drenched in butter it was borderline inedible. The house salad was chopped up iceberg lettuce with a shrimp thrown on top...lacked any real substance or flavor. Much better food/value out there."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 on a Friday night to celebrate my daughter's graduation. Some AZ locals and some of us from CA. What a wonderful experience!  We definitely felt well taken care of and spoiled.  From the on-time seating to the dessert celebrating our daughter, everything was perfectly timed and executed.   The service (thanks, Brian!) was impeccable. I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Overall, just this shy of an utter delight.   The shrimp cocktail made a great impression with the oxymoronic jumbo shrimp suspended in cocktail sauce above a boiling cauldron of dry-ice steam. The horseradish and sauce combo was something close to ambrosial.  I ordered the bone-in filet done \"rare-plus\" and believe it to be some of the best prime beef I've experienced. My friend had the porkchop which also was done just right. The sides were the gorgonzola mac and cheese and a dish I almost refuse to believe were brussels sprouts: they were THAT tasty. We left with 5 boxes of leftovers, and neither of us could be called dainty eaters.  The atmosphere spoke of swank in a way that a high-dollar steakhouse should, with friezes in glass panels and blood-red lighting throughout.   So what holds me back from 5 stars in this case? Well, at this level of pricing ($47 for the filet a la carte) in a place like this on a Friday night, no customer should need to remind the server twice to bring water. And we did.  So, not quite perfect. Would I go back? I think so."}
{"text":"Omg it's Tuesday night and the restaurant is packed. We had a chop salad which was enough for 2-3 ppl. I had the bone in filet which was delicious and shared the Gorgonzola mac and Cheese both amazing. Anniversary dessert and dirty martini were the icing on the cake. Highly recommend. Service was flawless."}
{"text":"It is a tradition for my boyfriend and I to take each other to a nice dining restaurant to celebrate birthdays. A few friends recommended City Hall for a nice, romantic dinner. I made reservations using Open Table and noted the special occasion. We were promptly seated upon our arrival and the ambiance was pleasant. There was a small band alongside a piano player playing top chart music and provided a great relaxed atmosphere.  Our food was great and came out piping hot! We each had the fillet- cooked EXACTLY as we ordered...which is always a plus by me. Also, we split the macaroni and green beans. For dessert, we were treated with a birthday butter cake with a rich and decant ice cream...that alone would have been a great treat on its own.   The only small \"complaint\" I have is the wines. Two weeks ago I bough the \"Crush\" Dreaming Tree Wine for 15.00 at Frys...it is a great smokey, red blend. But, the bottle was $40 on the menu. What is the difference? Will the wine bottle at Mastro's make me poop gold eggs? If so, I'd buy it...otherwise...no thanks.  Above all ...the service was fantastic! I really appreciated the quick response to fill my drink and provide recommendations.   Great time to celebrate my wonderful boyfriend's day of birth."}
{"text":"There is not one bad thing to say about Mastro's. From the service, to the beverages, to the menu - everything is top notch and classy. They say it is an \"unparalleled dining experience\" and they are not lying.   The ambiance in the place is wonderful.   I've been there a few times and have tried a few things. I always get the Filet because it is as close to perfection as is humanly possible. The steaks come out on scorching hot 400 degree plates and are placed in front of you with sheer decadence. The mashed potatoes are incredible. The Lobster mashed are the greatest thing ever. The mac and cheese is to die for. It is the perfect blend of cheeses and creaminess. The asparagus is perfectly scorched (in a great way). You will not regret your choice."}
{"text":"Deserving of the many accolades it has gotten here on Yelp. This is a very very classy place to dine and the service is impeccable. The steaks and seafood are absolute top shelf."}
{"text":"Is this place fancy? yes. Is this place expensive? yes... Is it worth it? yes, well at least once. The ambiance is unlike olther steakhouses. It is very modern and upscale, yet does not have that dark steakhouse feel. The service is perfect. While I dined there i felt like a king. The waiter was very helpful and professional, yet also friendly.The only drawback was the food. While it was very good, it wasn't great, and for the prices I expected greatness. My steak, which was the New York Strip was good, and cooked to perfection but lacked flavor. In other words I have had a better cut of meat. My girl on the other hand had the Filet, which was outstanding. It also was cooked to perfection and had the flavor my steak was missing. The best parts of the meal though were the Calamari appetizer and the Lobster Mashed potatoes. If you go there and just get one thing get the lobster mashed...They are worth it. Would I go back here, yes, would I get the New York Strip no, but the sides and service and general feel of the place makes it worth the four star rating. Just keep in mind you will spend lots of money, but you will feel like royalty and get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"best restaurant hands down, my bf & mine FAV my bf and i have been here prob over 50 times.  we moved back to Canada now but visit AZ every 3 months and always go at least once to the city hall mastros. I really like the ocean club one, but my bf insists on this one.  amazing food great bar wonderful service"}
{"text":"Ok, this review will be short and sweet, for what else can I say that hasnt been said about City Hall already. This place is phenomenal, perfect Filet Mignon, and even if you hate spinach, their Creamed Spinach will convert you into a spinach lover! Of course you should ALWAYS order their Lobster Mashed Potatoes, which may sound like an unusual combination to some, but trust me, you will not regret it. I am a die hard fan of Peter Lugers in New York, and City Hall is the only steakhouse in AZ that even comes close! Try it, you will LOVE it! Worth every cent, and then some!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, awesome wine selection, great ambiance. I took a client to dinner here, and it was perfect for that. Seems that it is a popular business dinner spot on weekdays.  Ribeye was one of the best I've ever had, lobster bisque was also awesome. The sides were good, but the Mac and cheese left a bit to be desired. Honestly though, given the 20 oz medium rare masterpiece that was my main dish, who cares about sides.  Don't expect to go here on any sort of a budget."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for two that was set up by the Biltmore Hotel. at 8:15pm. We waited over one hour and fifteen minutes and our table was stil not ready. We were leaving when the hostess informed us that our table was finally ready. We were so angry that we left.Clearly we were not the only ones that had this experience. While sitting at the bar we talked to two other couples that were also waiting a long time. Every 15-20 mintes I asked the hostess about our reservation and her standard response was \" your table will be ready in about 5-10 minutes\". It was so insulting.  The manager had the nerve to come outside to let us know that our table was finally ready and he could seat us then. I said no thanks. We were told by a couple that was leaving that Mastro's will allow people to cut in if they know someone that works in the restaurant. What is the point of setting up a reservation there if you do not have a friend that works ther? They will be out of business in a year or two given they way they treat people that have reservations.  DISGUSTING!  John P."}
{"text":"Recently visited for our first time and wow, were we impressed! Fantastic food delivered with fantastic service.  I've been a fan of the Palm Steakhouse over the years and have been disappointed they haven't chosen to expand to AZ, but now I can get an equal or better meal here at Mastro's!  Can't wait to get back again."}
{"text":"Truly an exceptional experience from the food to the atmosphere to the service. You get all this while not being uppity, but rather trendy and hip. I'm unfortunately not a steak eater because everyone else at the table had steaks and almost died and went to heaven. I had the sea bass which was no less amazing and not to mention the largest and most generous chunk of fish I've ever seen at a nice restaurant. I couldn't even eat half. We had the lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and green beans as sides which were all delicious. They have an excellent wine list in all price ranges and I noticed they had quite a nice selection of vodkas and martinis. Highly recommended for a special occasion or a special date ;)"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse I have ever experienced.  I had the NY strip.  It was perfect.  The lobster was the best I have ever had.  The butter cake is incredible.  Ambiance is lively and not at all pretentious.  Live music in the bar was a great addition.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sides, the steak is great too! My husband and I come here as often as possible. You must try the butter cake it doesn't sound like much but it is incredible! Best dessert in town!"}
{"text":"Best pork chop I've ever had! Rib eye is still amazing. Wasabi mashed potatoes are great and you can't go wrong w/sauteed mushrooms. Once again, service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"I went here for a company Christmas party and was pleasantly surprised. The food was great and so was the service. Everyone orders their own protein and then each table orders the sides family style. This could be great unless, like me, you are sitting at a table with people who want to order sides like creamed corn. WTF? I would love to go back and order a normal side dish like mashed potatoes with my meal..."}
{"text":"So my parents came to visit me in town for the weekend and wanted me to take them to the best steakhouse in town. After a quick search on yelp it was pretty evident that mastros was the answer... And it didn't disappoint!  I made a reservation using open table on yelp and we were in on a busy night. We had a great table and great service that walked us through our first experience at Mastro's.  The range of wines, drinks and cuts of steak they have is amazing... Not to mention the generously portioned sides. If you order a martini they bring out the entire shaker for you!  I went with a new york strip. It was cooked perfectly and we accompanied it with gorgonzola mac n cheese (very good) garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach.   It was an amazing meal capped off by a free warm butter cake on the house because it was our first time.  If youre looking for excellent service, a nice ambiance and amazing food- Mastro's is a place that impresses in all aspects.   I will come here again, as often as possible."}
{"text":"If you have been to city hall before you don't need to look at reviews because you already know that it is awesome. From the fancy martinis to oysters to the steaks,seafood and all the fantastic sides there is no question one of the best fine dining places to eat at in Phoenix area.   But for the people that haven't been I have 2 words for you BUTTER CAKE!!!   Order it for your appetizer so you make sure you have plenty of room to enjoy it.  Anyway I want to thank the staff at city hall for making our dining experience fantastic and we will see you down the road."}
{"text":"We had 8 in our Father's Day party last evening...the whole evening was 'on point'! The greeting, table service, food,drinks all excellent and exceptional! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience. Not only was the food great but the service was amazing. Loved our service staff and server KrstnN. I had the lobster bisque, bone in fillet with the lobster mash potatoes. Went in hungry left there stuffed. I would definitely recommend Mastro's for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  5 for $6 til 7pm?!  Great food and ambiance.  Steak is of course amazing."}
{"text":"Was here for a business trip, we decided to venture out and went to dinner.  This place was great (coming from NYC), great steak and wine list, and our waiter was very attentive.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Definitely fast becoming my favorite steakhouse.  Order the Bone in ANYTHING medium rare with the pepper crust and you won't be disappointed. The lobster mac and cheese is awesome. Not quite as good as Capital Grilles but damn good and def close.  The steaks are amazing. The service is acceptable for sure. The sides are also quite good. The ambiance is very hip and modern professional.  The cost is quite high so be ready for that. Steak runs about $55 and the Lobster mac is I believe $30 but big enough for 3 people to share for sure. Brussel Sprouts are great.   Parking kinda sucks. So valet, just don't make the mistake of going to the clubs or bars around Scottsdale and leaving your car at Valet here because they close at 10:30pm and you will have to Uber home. We did that and it was quite a shit sandwich of a situation.  I plan to hit this place a couple times a month, its that good. I'll probably alternate between it and Capital Grille. Capital is quieter and id say a bit more \"fancy\". City Hall is quite loud especially in the bar area so be prepared for that. It's def a place to be seen. For me its a place for a good biz meeting and to have a killer steak.  Oh and if you order anything WELL DONE, please go fuck yourself."}
{"text":"We an excellent dinner at Mastro's City Hall last night, reservations for 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed which is a testament to the quality of the food and service.          We started off with the Ahi Tuna Tartare and Crab stuffed mushrooms and both were of amazing quality, the flavors were out of this word.  The house salad was next and it did not disappoint with the buttermilk bleu cheese dressing, onions, tomatoes, and plenty of Shrimp it could has easily been a meal itself.          Now to the main course i had the bone-in ribeye  which was perfectly rare all the way through and charred on the outside and my wife had the bone in fillet medium rare and both were to die for, hands down some of the best beef i have ever experienced.          Oh wait i forgot the sides an order of the lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese and the Colossal onion rings all of which exceeded already high expectations.  The mashed potatoes were velvety with loads of flavor and a large amount of lobster incorporated, the Mac was as it should be nice and cheesy without being overdone, and the onion rings were perfect easy to eat because you could actually bite through the onion and it did not slide out after the first bite.          The wine selection is one of the best in the Valley with a wide variety of wines uner $100 and plenty of excellent wines above the $100 price point.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and they discovered that they were out of it and offered one at a higher price for the price of the one i had ordered, they didn't have to but it was nice.                Mastro's is a complete experience and it is the little things that they do that make going there better than say Ruth's Chris or another steakhouse in Scottsdale or PV.   We will be going back much more often and this is now my go to steakhouse in the valley and all others will be measured against it and most likely come up short where Mastro's exceeds.  Also of note it was a little loud but the place was packed and that is to be expected there were business people making deals and people out celebrating so I didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect evening last night at Mastros!  Our table was waited on by Alan, who made us feel incredibly special at every turn.  Every detail was cared for with fine dining precision.  The food was prepared like it was intended for royalty, with an entire table of 9 silently enjoying their own perfectly prepared cuts.  This will be my new personal business meeting dining choice moving forward.  Thank you Mastros!"}
{"text":"When you want your steak done the right way you want done right  the first tine.. Sometimes if you are hungry you don't have time for a replacement! Get it right the first time Mastro's'"}
{"text":"First time here, fantastic meal, great service. We had a party of 14 and the team assigned to us was perfect. All courses were timed perfectly. The raw appetizer seafood tower was tremendous. The food prepared for our order was flawess. Highly recommended this place for big parties, business and pleasure."}
{"text":"Best meal of my life  hands down. From the bread, huge jumbo shrimp appetizer, bone in filet, and butter cake. It was all incredible!!! my husband and I went for our one year anniversary and it was epic. We Ordered The Sautéed Shrimp App And The Sauce Is A Garlic Butter Sauce. I could just drink the sauce.  Then for our meal he ordered the porterhouse and I ordered the bone in filet Oscar style which came with lump crab meat and a bernaise sauce on top. Both came out perfect. For sides we had the infamous lobster mash which is a must. Huge lumps of lobster. Also the mac and cheese, green snap peas, and Brussel sprouts with bacon. Yes We Went All Out.  As if that was not enough, we ended with a butter cake. It had a delicious sugar crust and was so surprisingly light.  It was my first experience eating here and I will definitely be back. The hostess' Were All Nice And Not Phony Like Some Of Scottsdale. And service was great."}
{"text":"I had lived in Arizona quite a while before I tried City Hall. I thought it was kind of just another steakhouse. When I met my boyfriend, turns out this is his favorite place. Lucky for me! They make the most exceptional filet. Mmmmm. So good. Every time. I also love the exceptional service and can't forget the amazing snap peas!"}
{"text":"I bright guests from Japan, and we had a great time. It's was a super bowl night, so the restaurant was kind of empty and nice. We had great steaks while enjoying live music. This is a great place for some special dinner and a date!!"}
{"text":"Always a phenomenal meal.  Very disappointed in the tatted up bartender that was way more interested in texting than serving. Thank goodness for the nice lady working the other side of the bar who totally picked up his slack.   Visited on 2/5/2014"}
{"text":"Overall we were pretty disappointed. The service was lacking. It took our waitress 15 minutes to get our drink order, another 30 until our appetizer order, and 40 minutes later our food order was taken. When the tuna appetizer came, I was the only person in our party of four to be offered chopsticks, and the server took my plate away! I had to flag down a bus boy to get a new one.I had the New York steak and it was ok, I've grilled better at home. My husbands filet tasted off. Our friends steak was incredibly salty. The lobster mashed potatoes weren't spectacular, I've had better at el gaucho. Makes me wonder if the lobster was frozen because we are nowhere near the water here. The Caesar salad needed some citrus, and the dressing was very bland. Even the asparagus was just so so. Our waitress was less attentive than the bathroom attendant! They compensated us by taking the salty steak off the bill and brought dessert at no charge. Unfortunately, the creme brûlée was curdled. At $450 for dinner I'd say this was a total let down. We advised our host at the resort we are staying at to never recommend this place to anyone. I'm sure some people like it, I think they just don't know any better."}
{"text":"Went again last night and it was an amazing night. Seriously the food in unbelievable! Had a different bone in ny strip and it was unreal! We also had the seafood tower which was great. The oysters and shrimp were awesome but really the crab claws stole the show! Unreal sweet taste!  Finished off with butte cake which melts in your mouth.  There really is no better food or service!!"}
{"text":"The. Bar. Is. A. Scene.  What a great place.  Big steaks, live lounge music 7 days a week and mambo salads.  This is a must do if you are in Scottsdale.  My only complaint is a limited gin menu.  Save room for the butter cake!"}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin and I ventured out for steak a couple of nights ago and ended up walking over to Drinkwater's. We hadn't been there for several months, but I love the fact that it's walking distance (so I can have a couple of single malts and not have to worry about the drive home). We sat out on the patio and the fire was going and the weather was cool, but not cold, really pleasant (although I would like for things to get a touch warmer...but, that's a quibble). The ambiance is nice both inside the restaurant and out on the patio (nice fireplace!). We started with scotch and martini's and they do pour a nice drink! I was pleasantly buzzing by the time we got our salads.  The steaks were very good, and we always stick to the simple steak and salad formula when we go to Drinkwater's (BTW, is there really any other cut besides a bone in Rib-eye? Honestly, I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and there just isn't a better cut for steak, IMHO:). The service was very good, as always, and the drinks, salads, steaks and sides arrived hot (or cold as necessary), and on time. Drinkwater's ( I know, it's Mastro's now, but old habits are hard to break) is good place for a simple steak and salad. The do it very well. A little on the expensive side (approx. $250 for the 2 of us), and as always, for that kind of dough, I need to be thinking \"foodgasm\" for 4-5 stars, but a very credible steakhouse."}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday so we decided to go there for an amazing dinner. However several things happened that had not happened before. I had called twice to confirm time and seating preference and also to make sure that they had the right thing written down on the card that they leave on the table for special occasions. But when we got there the table was wrong and they did not leave the card on the table. I voiced my opinion to the hostess and a manager immediately appeared and made it up to us with a bottle of champagne, very nice. Second, I waiter was great, but he was so busy with other tables that we rarely ever saw him. But, the food was absolutely AMAZING !!! I will only order a steak from city hall because it puts every other steak offered at any restaurant to shame... Even the side that we got, scalloped potatoes and the piece of cake they brought my wife for her birthday were AMAZING... Will absolutely be back and will recommend to friend and family."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Everything we had was absolutely amazing ... best New York steak I've ever had - very juicy and flavorful.  We also ordered 3 sides - sauteed broccoli, garlic mash and mac and cheese, all of which were also excellent!  Our server suggested adding a jalapeno into the mac and cheese to give it some kick, but some people in our group don't eat spicy food, so we didn't.  But I imagine that would have made it even better.    Service was outstanding and I also love the ambiance.  We went on a Saturday night and they had live music in the bar area.  I'd definitely save this for a special occasion though as it was quite pricey."}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse in Scottsdale!! Our waiter Bobby from Thousand Oaks was flawless and treated us like family. The Porterhouse melted in my mouth. My wife loved her bone in filet. The desert white cake was divine. Excellent experience!!"}
{"text":"Very fun old school place. Huge portions , very satisfying! Definitely be back next time! Great for groups and special occasions!"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting at this great Mastro's! Excellent food,service and staff! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Usually come here a couple times per year.  Service extremely slow. Brought out overcooked steak.  Drinks were made poorly.  Moscow mule tasted like vodka straight up.  Overcharged us on a scotch even though menu gave lower price.  No apologies from Management.  Consider alternative steakhouses.  Plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"What else can you say??  Great atmosphere...great food and even GREATER Martinis!   Had my first official date here with my Boyfriend and we have been together for 3 years!  We have been here many times too...and will come back many times in the future!   From appetizers to dessert, City Hall gets it right every time....so when the time comes and we are getting ready to walk down the aisle...This will be my first choice for our engagement party!"}
{"text":"Superb and two thumbs up! Every bite was delicious. We came here to celebrate our engagement and we were treated like royals! Dirty Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives... Yum! Pretzel bread.. Get in my belly. We love ordering the decadent crab gnocchi, green beans with almonds, asparagus, oysters... You name it and they will blow your socks off. This place is a carnivore's dream! Filet for me and a bone in filet for the hubby! Can't wait to come back.. Oh.. And always order the butter cake."}
{"text":"went there for valentine's day with other couples and the place was packed.  i must say though we made reservations and was seated right sways when our group arrived.  our server was great and as busy as they were he didn't miss a beat with our request   food was awesome especially the lobster mash potatoes.  the hubby and i split a steak which certainly help with the overall cost because i will pay a pretty penny for this delicious meal."}
{"text":"Visited my son during  Father's Day weekend in Scottsdale and dropped in for a steak dinner,  and I have to say that this was one of the best ever.  My son didn't care for the \"salesy\" / pushy presentation of the waiter, but as the place filled up that went away, and the waiter clicked into more of a service mode.  We both had the bone in filet, several great vegetables,  cocktails and one glass of wine each.  The décor and ambiance is superb.  I would hate to try and get into this place during high snow bird season.  Luckily it was a quiet weekend in town.  This place is perfect for clients or special occasions and is very pricey.  But you get it all here."}
{"text":"#1 in AZ.  Anytime I want to go out for a special occasion, no question where we are going.   Classy atmosphere, good service and the food is off the charts. Bone-in filet & lobster mash are divine.  Definitely my favorite of the Mastro's line.  This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was contacted by the general manager within a day or two (the reservation was in his name) and I've also received a message from the restaurant asking to discuss. We appreciate that this issue is important to them."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, wonderful Service, chic ambiance all at outrageous prices.  Take out a second mortgage before you celebrate a once-in-a-lifetime event here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. City Hall is the bar by which all other dining experiences are measured.   We typically sit in the bar unless its a special occasion. The lighting is nice and the atmosphere is more casual. There is almost always live music but be careful not to sit to close if you care about having a conversation because it can be a little loud.  Leona and Brit always take amazing care of us in the bar area. You are sure to get one of these great ladies if you seat yourself at one of the high top tables.   The filet is amazing as is the chefs cut New York, the lobster mashed potatoes are worth every penny, but the buttercake is the bomb!! Save room.... Sure it might be a few dollars more than the other local steakhouses but the service is always impeccable and the steaks are always served at correct temperature the first time. I would give it six stars if I could, City Hall is a sure thing I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"We went to Mastro's City Hall for our son's birthday and unfortunately much of his steak was inedible elastin, and he was fighting it the whole time. Everything else was well executed, especially the dessert, but the quality of the cut of his steak was a let down. The other 3 steaks we ordered were excellent. Our waiter was scarce. She only stopped by right after the food was served before we had a chance to cut into our steaks, and then returned at the end of our meal, so we never had a chance to let her know there was a problem. She did comp his steak but it was a very disappointing birthday dinner for our son."}
{"text":"The first location I was to is the one on Pinnacle Peak Road earlier in the year. I would echo my original review here with Mastro's being a surprisingly good find for a steakhouse. This time I had the bone in filet and it was great from start to a clean bone left in the end. Service was great for a large group coming in on a reservation that did not quite cover all that showed up -- in other words, they were flexible to expand out table to accommodate us quickly and everything still worked out very well."}
{"text":"Have to give my home away from home and the steakhouse that sets the bar to all others, an updated review.   We always eat in the bar area - more lowkey and the people watching is some of the best. Britt and Leona ALWAYS and I mean always take great care of us.   In all the times I've ate here (probably at 75-100 times now), they have always made my steak perfect. Never had to send a thing back. What other steak joint can say that??   And now the best thing about the place...Sorry steak and service, you are awesome BUT the best thing is the buttercake. Greatest dessert in the world. Better get u some!!"}
{"text":"Mastro's certainly impressed my clients. I was told to come here as they were THE steakhouse of Arizona. We all ordered steak and sides, plenty of drinks and wine glasses, as well as the butter cake dessert to top it off.  So glad I did my research here prior to coming. Be prepared to order wisely. I was a bit overwhelmed with the prices at first but then quickly learned that an $18 martini is really 2 martinis (they give you the shaker to hold onto, so that when you're done with your glass, you pour the remaining parts as a second portion). Also for wine - nearly all wine glasses were $18-$25..this was shockingly high at first glance, especially in Arizona. But then learned that they pour 5-6oz glasses rather than 4-5oz, so it's more like a glass and a half. Finally - the sides, at $13 per side with the lobster mac n cheese at a whopping $35, we asked if we could get half portions. Half portions were the perfect amount and they charged $7 instead of $13...everything was so rich, that honestly beyond a half portion would have really gone to waste and not have been finished.  The ambiance is gorgeous in the main dining room as well as the al fresco patio are impressive and elegant. We actually sat in the piano room (we did a walk-in at 5PM) although the entire restaurant was empty when we entered - they sat us at the the high table tops which were a bit too casual for my taste for a lengthy sit-down steak dinner, but we did enjoy the live piano music and singers throughout the evening.  Service was fair - it was a busy evening and the waiters were busy left and right.  The food was delicious but oddly the most memorable part of it was the Butter cake. The steaks and sides were solid and cooked well.  Overall, a solid experience - but would make note and come even more prepared with reservations next time. Mastro's is great for a special occasion or business meals. Great for any size party as well - they do accommodate large parties, too."}
{"text":"I went in last week as my very first time at City Hall. I been to their other location Ocean Club and have been wanting to check this place out~  Everything was perfection!!! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the hosts and since we had reservations, we were seated right away. I been to Steak 44 w a reservation and I still had to wait 30 minutes so this was very nice!!   As soon as we sat down, we were asked what type of water we want and a wine menu was brought out. I normally do bottles but since I was w my co-workers, just opted for a glass of prosecco.  As appetizers, I ordered the crab cakes and the seafood tower!! The seafood tower is massive!! But sooo good and fresh!! The Dungeness crab, the king crab legs, shrimp, oysters, and even the caviar was amazing!!! For the caviar, they bring you out two types of bread and all these condiments that you pair it with!! So fun and good!! The crab cakes didn't disappoint either. One of the best I've ever had!  At this point, I'm stuffed from the seafood tower but I can't stop eating!! How can I waste all these delicious seafood?!!!  As my main entree, I got the Chef's Cut ribeye chop.. it's HUGE!!!!!! 33oz!! Cooked to perfection!!!! Crispy and charred on the outside and kinda bloody on the inside! Perfect medium rare!! Did I mention they have an atomic horseradish that is so addicting??!!   The dishes are a la carte, so we ordered a bunch of sides to share: Lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola mac n cheese, sautéed mushrooms in truffle oil, creamed corn, and brussel sprouts. My favorite out of the sides was the lobster mashed potatoes. But everything was delicious!!   As for dessert, we shared the signature warm butter cake (my favorite!!!), triple chocolate layer cake (this was massive!!! One slice was equivalent to an entire cake!!!), creme brulee, and profiteroles (this was massive too!!! 4 giant cream puffs filled w ice cream!). Everything was amazingly!! I just wished my stomach was bigger!!  Would definitely recommend this place! Top food quality, service and ambiance!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner in which we were entertaining a customer and give it 4.5 stars.  I think this restaurant is a fantastic dinner out if you are paying with a company card, but I am not sure I would return if I were coming on my own dime.  First the positives.  The food was outstanding.  The seafood tower was the highlight for me.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  The oysters in particular were fantastic.  I also loved the \"atomic\" horseradish.  I am big fan of spicy, and that hit the spot.  My steak was very good but my colleague's sea bass was even better -- I think I would get that over the steak if I were to return.  The sides were all outstanding.  The lobster mashed potatoes were amazing with huge chunks of lobster and the gorgonzola mac n cheese was SO good.  The roasted brussel sprouts were also fantastic.  The butter cake dessert was also delicious.  Our waitress did a great job with wine recommendations and everyone was really pleased with the bottles she helped pick out.  Service was excellent and at the level to be expected at a place like this.  There were a few negatives however that prevent me from giving out that elusive fifth star.  The restaurant itself is very dimly lit, to the point where the waitstaff carries flashlights for the wine list.  I did not love this, but not a big deal.  Our waitress was pleasant but she upsold everything.  All of her recommendations were the most expensive items on the menu and she convinced us on several occasions to go for more expensive items than we originally planned to order.  I have to hand it to her, she's a great saleswoman, and since it was not my own money, I did not mind.  However, if I were here with my husband and we were paying, I would have found that irritating.  The other annoyance was the bathroom attendant.  I really hate having to spend a dollar every time I go to the bathroom.  It's just an awkward experience having someone turn on your water and pump your hand soap, totally unnecessary.  And finally, as I mentioned previously the steak was really good but it was not amazing, which is what I was expecting based on the waitress's description.  I would definitely recommend Mastro's for a corporate dinner out and would love to return if I am in the area again on business."}
{"text":"Drinks and food delicious - service sucked !   30 minutes without checking in, ordered dessert and never shows up. Waitress stalls another 10 minutes and then told to go to bar for change.  And another 10 minutes to get check so they could bring cake.  Will definitely avoid that waitress.  Don't know her name .  So not usual service"}
{"text":"5 star steakhouse everything was good except the tuna tar tar do not order it unless you like to taste different than anywhere else... It was ok to have spice to it but the flavors made it far from tuna tar tar"}
{"text":"I was there last week with girlfriends for drinks. The bartenders were condescending and rude throughout our time there.  At approximately 11:30 p.m., they told us we had to leave, so we rushed to finish our wine.  Evidently, the bartender wanted us out faster than were moving and he did everything short of physically pushing us out.  The bartender walked us out of the restaurant and locked the door, with no regard for our safety.  The valet had left and there was no one outside.  We quickly called our Ubers, but then realized that at some point one of us would be left alone.  The first Uber to arrive agreed to give us all a ride and we were safe.      I've been to the restuarant several times for dinner, but because of this event, I will not be returning.  There are so many other places to go to in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best steak in town period."}
{"text":"If you're willing to spend the money this place is the ultimate dining experience!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend some cash, but the service and food are over the top. This go around I had the rack of lamb, which was like a whole lamb, in lieu of the Kobe beef. The sides are amazing. Great wine list. If you eat here more than once a year....you will die, it's that amazing, but bad for you. But, that being said, you only live once. Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"Superb dining experience. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgable, and even spent time explaining a variety of menu options to our curious teenager. Dinner was incredible. My husband and I split a 30oz slab of waygu called a 'tomahawk' It cut like butter. My son's rib-eye was just right. Other party members were extremely happy with their trout and sushi. The family-style sides were excellent. I'm drooling as I write this review... the gorgonzola macaroni and cheese is a must. For dessert, the butter cake. Just get it. Your world will be rocked."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix last week and our group went here for dinner.  It was fantastic.  This is a very good steakhouse.  My only problem is that Arizona does not allow corkage in their restaurants.  Arizona state law.  I had brought with me as luggage a case of mixed California killer cabernets and showed up at the restaurant with 6 of them.  Well that got shot down pretty quick but very professionally.  I ended up ordering off their wine list which was not bad.  Food and service are top notch here.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to Mastro's after I had decided on where to sign the lease for the car and apartment as I was in the midst of moving to Arizona from SF.  This place is amazing.  I ordered the Rack of Lamb, which is phenomenal.  I wish I could afford to come here!  It was a very special treat.  You can't go wrong with whatever you order here.  They serve you gigantic portions of food and all-you-can-eat breadsticks.  There was so much food, I took a good portion of it to-go and ate the leftovers for breakfast.  YUM!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! From the food to the service to the decor & overall! Service was wonderful & it is busy so you should def make reservations!   We had the lobster mac & cheese to share for a side & the stuffed mushrooms. They give you a lot of food so there's no way one person could finish all that.   For the main course I had the salmon which was so amazing & melted in my mouth. My boyfriend had the most tender flavorful steak. (Had no time to take pictures cuz It was so delicious I couldn't stop haha)  The waiter & busboy were so friendly & attentive.  It's very dark in their but the vibe is intimate!   No complaints here this place is high end & you get what you pay for! Buuuut the most amazing part was desert! Even though you may be full you need to try the buttercream cake!!! Seriously it was heaven! So fresh & hot & with the ice cream it balances out so perfect!   Overall it was a great experience & well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a superior Mastro's location.  We had a wonderful experience.  The staff went above and beyond at every chance.  This was the best cherry on top celebration to the completion of my Bachelor's Degree!   The seafood tower is definitely a must.  The presentation is like what I imagine being in the future to look like... dry ice streaming from around the incredible fresh offerings of fish.  The melt in your mouth butter fish was a first for me and a new favorite.  I would definitely come here again, especially to enjoy the celebration of a special occasion."}
{"text":"As good a steakhouse as there is!   Proof that money does buy you the finer things in life. This place is on the steep end of the price scale. But you know that coming into it. The food and service is prime...  Note: Place is very dark and the noise level can be tremendously loud!"}
{"text":"Great place to take clients! Amazing food and service"}
{"text":"Our group of 9 showed up at 8:00 for our 8:00 reservation that was made over a month in advance. We were not seated until 8:37 and nobody from their staff seemed empowered to do anything about it.  The food and service after that were very good but it was too little too late to make up for he bad start."}
{"text":"We have previously loved this restaurant. Tonight they were off their game. Meat was nervy -- just ok. Waitress was efficient but lacked a real interest in our dining experience. Forgot we wanted wine with main course. Unlike our previous visits, this one was off the mark."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bar only..I have eaten here and it is hit or miss don't get the stone crabs very weak, over priced..We show up to the bar and get a seat..Service is very spotty..Wine by the glass expensive and not worth while.  how about some good half bottle choices?  The band that night, a nice 3 piece outfit very good..but then we are treated to a very drunk, strange bald guy who takes the mike.  I only point out that he is bald in case you see him there..he is a regular and \"Clean\" as he was known in college does not disappoint.  He comes and makes a fool of himself, and the staff accept it as he tips everyone so they let this drunk slide.  In the meantime he is whopping and all over the place..Nice! If you are over 40 this is a good spot for sure.  If all this is not enough the worst kept secret here is that the bar after 10pm has hookers..It is fun to watch old guys(I'm 38) 50+ make time with the bevy of women for hire..Again the staff accept this as it does bring in their demographic of wealthy older gentlemen and just so you know I am not complaining just pointing it out for the viewer.  I accept everyone ad if this is how you make a living fine by me.  I just think it odd in a semi-classy place they would allow it that's all.  I guess with all the competition now you gotta have a hook(or hooker!)"}
{"text":"Great steaks and love the pretzel bread. Steaks range from $40-$55 and sides are large and range from $7-$15."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Scottsdale and the first restaurant on our trip to dine at. My first thought very cool, hip, trendy, and poppy with the music. I hear Mastro's is supposedly up there with Morton's, Myron's, and Ruth Chris. Nope... it is not. Sadly, dinner was so disappointing my other half didn't want to deal with management and the poor service that was provided to us.   They originally put us in the back corner near the kitchen and the busy walkway from the kitchen to dinning area. What moron put's customers there? Why? Would you sit there? I mean I would put people who did not make RSVP there, yeah sure. So, we told them to find us better seats away from heavy traffic. Great they were able too.   Service started off strong, but then just fell flat before the main course. Bread crumbs on the table and nothing was cleared. We ordered a bottler of wine, soup and salad, ate it, and was still sitting in front of our faces until the steak came to the table, and they just moved it to the side. Oh so you just leave the empty salad plate and half eaten soup bowl there? Do you want me to take it back? They plopped the porter house steak in front along with the sides and walked away. Hmmm...I know others places cut the steak for you, and ask what cut do you want and even serving you the sides. But what do I know maybe this is a DIY wanna be bougie steakhouse?   I've had way better and excellent service at Gordon Ramsay's in Vegas, service all around from each staff member was exceptional. But Mastro's? What happened? I guess Shaima H. is right maybe they are discriminating... other than the steak was not good, and very chewy. We had a hard time deciding about tipping and all. It was the worst steakhouse experience ever. I mean I know for a fact I can get better service and steak at Outback."}
{"text":"Well well well...finally I made it to City Hall for the first time.   Overall experience was great, although maybe the only thing I wasn't crazy about is the dress code: expected to be less casual, more upscale, and less loud, especially for a Monday night, I was expecting to have a quieter dinner with my friend. However this restaurant still deserves a 5-star review.   They had a table ready for us right away with reservation. Our waitress was Allison and she took great care of us. Good personality, she introduced specials and gave good recommendations.   My friend and I started with soups: Lobster bisque and French Onion soup. Both a tasteful option to start our meal. My most personal pleasant surprise was the size of portions: starting from soups to dessert, portions are BIG and worth every penny in quantity and taste. The Lobster bisque has giant lobster chunks and the onion soup is delicately baked and blended with cheese and herbs. Great start.   We were craving seafood so we both got the 10 ounce salmon. Served with an anchovy, caper and olive-based sauce. Good combination. As a side we picked the Gorgonzola mac N cheese, probably the only dish I wouldn't get a second time. A bit insipid for being gorgonzola, but perhaps it was too well blended with other cheeses that it actually lost its strong taste.   But what I wanted to try more was their desserts. I heard a lot of people eulogizing about their warm butter cake, and they weren't wrong. It's OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Delicious, soft sponge cake served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Try it at least once!  As said before, portions were so big that we were able to box basically the whole dinner home.   Not a restaurant you can go in every night, but worth to go back a second time."}
{"text":"Sooooooo Good! I don't think this place could make a bad meal! So delicious and flavorful and one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I wish they had one closer to where I lived but I don't mind driving to eat some good food. It's a little expensive but worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner with 10 friends, everything from drinks, appetizers, mains and dessert were on point. The service was 5 star as was the entire experience."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place!  I only wish I could afford to eat here more often.  LOL.  City Hall is arguably my favorite steakhouse EVER.  I always get the filet, and it just completely melts in my mouth.  Every bite is like a piece of heaven.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Another must is the lobster mashed potatoes.  I know, it's like $30 for a side dish.  But trust me, it is well worth it, with big chunks of lobster generously layered in every bite, and the potatoes are whipped to smooth and creamy perfection.    The service at City Hall is always top notch.  And they have a wonderfully diverse wine list!  This is a must if you are visiting the Valley."}
{"text":"Good Steaks, Good Appetizers, good Sides (although the sides felt a bit heavy --- taking a few bites you would think is meal enough).  I would like to see however much more information on the Dry Aging process that they use and length of time etc... and provide more options in that area."}
{"text":"Sitting outside on the patio was the best decision we made. They have a nice modern fireplace and heat lamps when it gets cold. It's fully walled off and intimate. They had a great live band too. The decor of the place is great, I especially liked the bar with reddish glass all around. It's one of the first things you notice about the restaurant and I do have to say, they've done it right.   Our party shared the gigantic seafood tower with oysters, prawns, king crab legs, crab claws, and lobster as an appetizer. It was a 3-tiered UFO looking thing that landed on our table, complete with dry ice smoking at the top. I'm not the hugest fan of lobster or crab but my dining partners thought it was excellent. I enjoyed the prawns and oysters immensely.  The Swordfish I ordered left something to be desired (don't know what I was thinking ordering fish at a steakhouse) but I didn't like it very much, it was bland and a bit too firm for my liking. I also was disappointed to see farmed salmon on the menu, and it wasn't cheap either! I wouldn't expect farmed fish at any restaurant this expensive.  However the sides we got were TO DIE FOR! The lobster mashed potatoes and crab gnocchi made up for the fish. They were so decadent and insanely tasty, each bite was like a piece of heaven, and I don't even like crab or lobster by themselves so that's saying a lot!!   Our server recommended the butter cake with ice cream on top. It came with a vat of homemade whipped cream, larger than the size of the cake to dip it in. You could have given me a spoon and I would have just eaten the whipped cream alone! Also had the creme brule. I've had better but it was still good.    It was definitely spendy. Don't know if all the food is necesarally worth the price but I would go back just for the sides and also to do it proper and get a steak!"}
{"text":"We were invited back by management and went on a Thursday evening. It was quieter than on a Saturday. The service was excellent but the service is always fantastic, food is great. Started with a half order of spinach salad and went with the KC Strip, medium rare and it was perfect! Decided on a half order of Brussels sprouts which are scrumptious! Perfect meal and a perfect evening. Will return."}
{"text":"Easily the best steak I have had on the continent. The sides are spectacular and the service is impeccable. Start with a cocktail in the lounge Tammy is an outstanding bartender. The place has a nice vibe they had live music when we were there and it was not overwhelming just enjoyable background music."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because there were so many glowing reviews but I had high expectations for this restaurant.  Unfortunately, I would regard it as thoroughly so-so.  We went on a Sunday night, hoping for smaller crowds.  It was about 2/3 full.  The inside is lots of small tables crammed close together.  It would be hard for me to see how anyone could find that intimate or romantic.  It is probably incredibly noisy when it is full.  As others have mentioned, with the \"swank\" vibe going on, the top-40 music is totally out of place.  Sinatra, jazz, etc would be a much better fit.  We had marrow as an appetizer and it was a complete disappointment.  My advice to them would be to go to a good French restaurant for an example of how this dish should be done and revise the recipe.  It was fatty and bland, whereas it should be rich and garlicky.  We split a spinach salad and, again, it was fine but nothing special.  Really relied on heavy toppings like bacon and egg to have flavor.  For the main course, we each had the bone-in filet (12 oz) and shared the lobster mash as well as steamed asparagus.  The lobster mash came in a bowl that would have easily fed a hungry family of six, and there was probably 3/4 inch grease (butter?) floating on top that did not really add to the flavor.  My steak was too big.  If I return, I'd have my normal 8 oz filet.  We were only visiting the area, so taking home all these massive left-overs was not an option.  The service was fine.  When we ordered champagne, they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, which we were (belated birthday.) So they brought us a lovely piece of chocolate cake, which was very nice.  But I did notice, throughout the evening, the staff was scurrying around a lot. At one point, they were rush past each other right behind me, calling out \"Right behind you!\" to avoid running into one another.  In an expensive restaurant like this that relies so much on ambiance to set a mood, that kind of rushing around very much detracts from the experience.  Staff should be unobtrusive.    Our total bill was just shy of $400, mostly because I chose a fairly expensive champagne.  Pricing was in line with what I would expect at a high-end steak house in my home town (Seattle.)  So would I return?  Maybe.  Next time we visit the area I think I will try some of the other steak restaurants.  This place was ok but I am generally looking for more than \"ok\" when I spend hundreds of dollars on an evening out."}
{"text":"Two things: world-class rib-eye steak 4.98989989 stars and live music rambunctious dim atmosphere.This Mastro's in beautiful sunny Scottsdale is a proper elegant steakhouse. Came here based on recommendations from the king of steakhouses, Spencer H from D.C.   Atmosphere Classic dimly lit resto-bar steakhouse, live entertainment and energetic vibe. You have to yell to be heard here. I didn't hear anything from the people sitting in front of me, we had to text few times. Outside patio is only for private events. Same day reservation did the job for our party. Parking is easy, valet or parking lot.    Service Fantastic!. From reception to our wonderful waitress to the busboys, all were all smiles. My friend didn't like her initial dirty martini, the waitress happily brought her a sweet cocktail which did the job.   Food Your carnivore animal instinct for a good steak will be officially terminated after coming here. Their complementary bread includes about four types of bread. The best are those warm dangerous addicting pretzel baguettes. The rest of the bread was untouched. I recommend they don't serve the rest.  Not any steakhouse can cook a rib-eye steak nicely. It needs experience and skillful technique. They grill a pretty mean steak at Mastro's Scottsdale. It has the ideal charred surface and the juicy tender meat was so easy to cut. It was a blast of flavor with only salt and pepper on top. Served with grilled asparagus, that's how a steak should be. We shared a rack of lamb and veggies. The lamb was 3.98797970. I like lamb but I believe it is so hard to eat a good lamb in the US. The Mediterranean lamb is the best lamb in the world. Majority of the lamb in the US is imported from Australia or New Zealand. The taste is different. It is less flavorful, tougher and less fatty than the ancient world lamb. Overall, the lamb ribs were great, but I would stick to the rib-eye. It is phenomenal here. For drinks, recently I had an epiphany that water is the only best drink I can have. My water was nice and full of ice. People enjoyed their booze too.    $$$ Reasonable prices for the experience. For example, $60 for a delicious steak like that one above. They have wagyu beef steaks too.   After  Taking a walk after a dinner like this is mandatory. The breeze in Scottsdale was so lovely, fresh air from the desert mixed with some juniper-scented touch. It was a glorious walk not too far from this place. You get a courtesy call from them for routine follow-up. It was a pleasant gesture.   Recommended?  Totally!! Pretzel bread you will have. Get the rib-eye!. For ladies, no need for make-up here, it is dim and loud in here and no one will notice anything. Carnivore mode was pretty happy after this."}
{"text":"A must know ---- EXPENSIVE  I went here for a work dinner.  The steak is absolutely amazing, and so are the sides, not a single bad thing I can say about the place.  A nice place for a celebration.  Very dim/dark (waitress hands out a small flashlight if required to read the menu)  Very noisy as its connected to a bar with live music"}
{"text":"Got the bone-in ribeye and sautéed spinach to-go. They apparently do not have utensils for to-go. A bit disappointed. I guess I'll have to eat with my hands.  Review update:  I decided to give this location another chance and was met by someone whom I assume is the manager there. Took my take-out order right away, made great suggestions all while being very professional. I made my same utensils dilemma  suggestion to him and he actually exceeded my expectations and included their dine-in utensils with a steak knife. Definitely the Mastros kind of 5 star service hands down. Just wished their receptionists were as properly trained."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here and everything was delicious! From the pomegranate martini to the warm butter cake (compliments of the restaurant). Steak was cooked to perfection and side dishes of baked potato and snap peas were very tasty... And there's enough to bring home."}
{"text":"I was here years ago and my memory of the night was of great food and company (Jason K I hope you read this), so it was with high hopes at my visit 2 weeks ago.  The steak was real good...which is to say it was about what I would make on my grill with supermarket ribeye. Very disappointing.  And my party was given the bum's rush as we were finishing our drinks after dinner (if my dining companions ever read this my pseudonym is blown)....\"we have another party that would like this table....drinks are on us if you want to move to the bar\". I'll chalk that insult up to a rookie waiter, but no excuse on the pedestrian steak at what purports to be a top quality steak joint."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best steakhouse I've been to...EVER. Being from San Francisco we had high expectations and since it was my husbands birthday weekend we wanted to splurge, and good thing we came here. I made reservations and after checking in with the hostess had to wait about 20-30 minutes. This was a disappointing but they made up for it by providing complimentary champagne while waiting. After getting a bit antsy, we asked what was going on and it ended up being an oversight on their part. They then took us to a private room in the back where two other parties were seated. I liked the setup considering it was much louder in the main room and we were there to celebrate a special occasion.   They offer complimentary bread and we ordered a bottle of red wine (delicious but can't remember the name) with the Tomato & Mozzarella salad. For the main entree my husband and I split the 16 oz New York Pepper Steak (made to perfection) and paired it with the garlic mashed potatoes. I was in pure bliss. I don't eat a lot of red meat but when I do I make sure it's worth every bite! This was plenty of food for the both of us but we also had a late dinner (around 10pm). The waiter then surprised us with a birthday cake, their signature warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream and let me tell you...we were full but that cake tasted like heaven in our mouths that we couldn't let it go to waste.   Overall highly recommend visiting. Their service is exceptional and the food is worth the wait. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. I think I prefer Ruths Chris and Dc Steakhouse. The restaurant was clean and the service was good, so it is a matter of taste I suppose. My husband enjoyed his steak as well, but agreed with me.   I guess for the price I expect to be knocked off my feet and I wasn't.  To be fair, I only ate here one time so maybe It deserves a second chance.  Too bad they didn't grab my taste buds on the first shot though."}
{"text":"I can't give this a 1 because I didn't get to eat anything. I'm sure the food is lovely. I'm sure the service is lovely. The ambiance sucks though. I valeted my car and wandered in - it was a mad house. Loud and boisterous chatter with no sound deadening to help. Every surface is metal, tile or hardwood and every sound and every utterance is reflected and amplified - filling the room and getting in my ears like a thick soup.  I had the same issue with Ocean Club once before. I've managed to eat there successfully twice, but a third time I had to leave out of anxiety. The second time I tried eating at Ocean Club was a nightmare, but after we moved a couple of times, I made the best of it. The food and service there was great - as I imagine it is at City Hall. I just can't deal with such a crowd.  Too much noise and commotion like that puts me on edge and I can't enjoy a fancy meal. I guess it's not the sort of place one goes for a quiet fine dining experience. It's like a loud douchey crowded nightclub without the music, but at the same volume.   I had just arrived at City Hall, and immediately wanted to leave. My social anxiety kicked in, and we split. The valet hadn't even returned from parking our car when we asked them to bring it back. It's a shame, because we really wanted to try it out. Maybe we will try to eat there sometime when it's not so busy. Dinner time on a weeknight is apparently not going to work."}
{"text":"Each time we travel it seems that we always need to hit up a steakhouse (in the States of course, international travel is a total different story). So it was no exception when we came to Phoenix last month. I ended up ordering a steak and it was huge! Gave 3/4 of it to my boss's boss. The lobster mash was to die for... yums!  The drinks here were pretty good but pretty expensive. I think one of the cocktails we had was $16 each. Yikes!   The service was exceptional of course. They consistently refilled our drinks and folded our napkins each time we got up to use the restroom. The ambiance was pretty hip and romantic and perfect to take someone on a date. The price is pretty high tho - so be prepared to break  your wallet quite a bit."}
{"text":"we went here our last night in Scottsdale and the other reviews are right, this place rocks.  Everything we ordered was perfect and delicious and the service was awesome.  Our waiter even bought us dessert.  Coming from Chicago we had high expectations as we have a ton of good steakhouses here, however this was really a fantastic meal!!  The best part is they are opening in Chicago this summer...woo hoo!!"}
{"text":"Overall very disappointing. My steak and my wife's had a lot of gristle and while they had decent flavor mine was pretty salty. My wife's first steak came medium and they brought her a new one medium rare per her initial order. The creamed spinach was just ok, the lobster bisque was delicious, and the mushrooms were fantasict, the tuna tartare we started with did not have a nice springy texture as we are used to and had a weird texture overall (we sent that back).  While Mastro's did step up and remove the steak from our bill and gave us free dessert, it didn't really make up for the overall experience. The service definitely waned as we made our discontent known.  And, while I'm find with the music selection, it was odd to hear alternative/metal playing in this establishment, hearing Social Distortion playing Ball and Chain over their speaker system was not exactly what I was expecting!  Personally, I wish we'd gone to Morton's."}
{"text":"The steak was so good I started having heart palpitations.  Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin.  The dining room is beautiful.  The service was flawless.  And the food was out of this world.  Really tremendous.  The ahi tuna tartar?  Amazing.  The bone-in-fillet? Amazing.  Lobster mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous.  By far, the best steak I have ever had.  Better than Flemings, Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Durant's, El Chorro...  Seriously.  You are looking at about $100/head including drinks (not wine) and it is worth every penny.  I'm going to go pass out now."}
{"text":"Been here several times. By far my favorite restaurant. The service is amazing. The ambiance is amazing and the food is the best in the valley. I have yet to find anything wrong with the food after about 20 visits. It's a bit pricey for the average dinner night. I would suggest to come here on a special occasion for you first visit and make your reservation ahead of time (during making the reservation make sure you state what your special occasion is and you well be taken care of extra). As far as food recommendations I would say the filet mignon, crab legs or lobster. The cocktail drinks are very well put together, I would recommend the dream berry if you like cocktails. If there is one restaurant I think everyone should experience this is the place. Much better then Ruth Chris, Flemings, Donovan's and J&G steakhouse. ( this is just my personal opinion)"}
{"text":"Any food lover has stand out memories of a truly fantastic meal. Our dinner at Mastros ranks high on my list of best food and dining experiences. We went here last Saturday night for our 5 year anniversary. The ambiance was perfect, dim lit with nice aesthetics. The service was on point, waiters took care of everything, were non obtrusive while being very attentive and accessible. The food, I don't know where to start as it was so incredible. They start with a basket of different breads; pretzel roll, Parmesan bread, and sourdough. All equally good and unique. I had the king crab legs and my husband ordered a filet.   Cooked perfect and fresh. We had garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus for  our sides. Sides are big so plan to share them. We had the butter cake for desert. We were both so impressed with the meal here! It was truly wonderful and worth every penny."}
{"text":"came here for mother's day for the first time. Service was average, food was incredibly underwhelming considering the price, and as far as making a unforgettable first mother's day experience for my wife... I think they really fell short of expectations.   I received a call from the restaurant the following day (Monday) to ask how my experience was. I told them exactly what was stated above and I was informed a manager would be reaching out to me. That has yet to happen even 5 days later - so there also seems to be a lack of accountability and follow through. In terms of spending that kind of money on a nice meal - there are plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were invited to a birthday celebration for his coworker last weekend and they picked Mastro's for dinner. I had heard great things about this place and was stoked for a good steak, especially since my last steakhouse experience at Donovan's was a little lack luster.  Our party of 6 arrived right on time for our Saturday, 8:45pm reservation and we were sat almost immediately. The atmosphere was MUCH better than Donovan's and while it was much darker, it felt way more intimate and high class. There was some odd music..like the top 40 hits you hear on the radio but luckily our dinner mates were great to talk to and I only noticed it when I sat down.  Our waitress was outstanding the whole evening and the bread basket contained a small, long loaf of pretzel bread that was delicious! I was convinced by another couple at our table that my fiance and I should share the 'Chef's Cut\" Ribeye Chop at 33oz. While I'm a filet fan all the way, I thought I would break out of my norm and go with their recommendation. My fiance and I also ordered the warm spinach salad that was delicious! The egg and warm bacon dressing were so yummy!   Since we had three couples, each of us ordered different sides to try. We got the $32 Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Yes. $32 for some white potatoes. Now I don't like seafood but these were pretty good. I was able to give my lobster chunks away but they were definitely good and decadent. The other sides we tried were Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese, Green Beans with Sliced Almonds, Asparagus - Steamed. They were all good but at the waitresses recommendation,  we also ordered the creamed spinach. This was one of the top creamed spinaches I've had. Very rich. Very good.   Another very nice touch was when our dinner was served, we were swarmed by several waiters, each with one of our sides to serve each person at the table. Typically they are placed on the table and you each pass them around so this was a definite nice touch. Our steak was also good but I was reminded about why I order filets. While the meat had a great flavor, all the fat marbled throughout the steak just seemed like too much. Everyone else enjoyed their immensely so maybe I'm just the odd ball? Or because they didn't want to complain for their $60 odd dollar steak. I requested my fiance take me back another time to try the filet to really judge this place :)  Post dinner, our friend was brought out a nice piece of chocolate cake that said Happy Birthday and they even went so far to put his name. Another nice touch. The cake was super rich and I was stuffed so one bite was enough.  While the food, service and ambiance was really good, they lost 1/2 a star for the overly fatty steak and another 1/2 star for a very strong sewer smell upon our exit. Yes, that's probably super picky but everything else had been perfect so it left a tiny bit of a bad impression upon exiting.   Overall, I'd be excited to come back to this place and try a filet and maybe some other kind of potatoes."}
