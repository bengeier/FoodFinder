{"text":"Alto's has been my old faithful delivery place for years. The food is always good. The delivery is usually quick. The service (even just over the phone) is always very lovely."}
{"text":"Reasonable price, good and plentiful amount of food, very pleasant staff and stays open for longer hours than most of the places. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"LOVE their burgers and poutines. Good prices and they deliver quickly :), I usually get it delivered to McGill. Funny enough, I haven't tried their pizza yet lol. But everything I tried is great and my classmates all say they're pretty good across the board."}
{"text":"I love this place since my Mcgill days! I misssss it! But whenever I m in the area I run straight back for my poutine and pita or altoburger or chicken ceasar salad with garlic bread or pizza or wings and things.....too bad they only deliver downtown!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review its really the best late delivery place.
Sometimes the guy who takes the ordered is going to recommend exactly what you want and it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Alto has some of the best pizza in Montreal. It's a common complaint among my friends from other cities that it's next to impossible to find decent pizza for a reasonable price in this city, but Alto is up there with the best I've had anywhere. 

The rest of the food is great, too. I couldn't even estimate the number of late night poutines I ate here while I was in school. The only problem is that they don't deliver to my new neighbourhood, but nobody else does either, so I can't blame them."}
{"text":"All the staff is really polite and both service and food tasted really good at a really low price"}
{"text":"An old favourite. The lasagna,  poutine and chicken wings never disappoints! It's the perfect place to go to for those after-clubbing munchies. They also deliver - we used to order Altos to be delivered to our all night study sessions. The portions are LARGE."}
{"text":"Alto's is bomb. While the food is pretty standard in general terms, for latenight eats in Montreal (its open til either 4 or 5 am most nights, including delivery), their service is pretty much impeccable and their quality is consistent and most importantly, FAST. 

I have never once had to wait more than ten minutes for my food at altos, or more than 20 minutes for delivery. And it's usually faster. 

Plus their gyro and cheeseburger combos are a pretty good deal and hit the spot after a long shitty evening at the library or better yet one spent out getting crunked. 

The all dressed pizza and milkshakes are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Never disappoint ! Fast ! Good ! And even their pasta doesn't suck so bad( delivery pastas usually are t the best) 
Poutine is awesome and souvlaki comes with a super fresh green salad every time !"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, convenient hours, reasonable prices, and the best sandwich I've had yet in Montreal.  Great location too!  They have an extensive menu, but I cannot get past the steak sub. It is dreamy!"}
{"text":"Alto's is a slice of genius on a street which significantly lacks good food. Given their competition is Pita Pit and Subway, Alto's blows the competition in the area out of the water and serves up a plate of convenient food. Exactly what type of food? Whatever you want. Sandwiches, pizza, pita rolls, poutine, burgers, etc. I mean shit they do everything decently so it's a good place to go if you have craving for something late at night.

This place maintains this same standards throughout all hours of the night. They deliver till 5am on weekends and it's amazing how fast they are. I'd be hard pressed to find a better delivery place given the quantity of food this place makes on a given night"}
{"text":"An eclectic mix of Italian, Greek and North American foods that can be served without compromising quality for quantity or speed.

It's one of the few spots I'd define a fast food that actually serve GOOD food at very reasonable prices. Their Alto Burger trio usually fills me up pretty well, and this comes from a proficient eater.

Alto is strategically placed close to the McGill campus, the ghetto, the residences and the downtown scene. Yet despite the surroundings, it is never full and you are guaranteed to find a seat even when the Montreal Canadians hockey team is playing. 

The common sense with which Alto is run and their great quality for the prices charged would earn them four stars, yet one can't fail to mention their insanely late opening (and delivery) times and their proverbially fast delivery service.

What's more, delivery is free and I've never encountered a \"minimum amount\" barrier. 

I hotly suggest their burger trios and their milkshakes. Pita dishes are OK if you fancy a quick bite but aren't too hungry. The poutine is a good effort, but the cheese is normal grated brick one rather than the traditional curds, so explore other parts of the menu.

It is the meeting point of the restaurant, the deli and the fast food joint. It runs like clockwork, the kitchen is always busy (indicating good grocery turnover) and if you order to deliver you will have your food extremely fast, wherever you are."}
{"text":"Great Service and Late Night Eats.

While in many respects, Alto's is a bit of a generic Montreal-style diner, it stands out in terms of its customer service. I've ordered in from here in years, and the staff has always been polite, courteous, competent, and efficient. Indeed, any time there's been an issue with my order, it's been rectified quickly and at no additional charge.

And while their fare certainly isn't legendary, their late-night delivery is well worth the experience when you need something greasy and comforting in the late night hours.

I'd recommend the Chicken Parmesan Sub or Burger any late-night of the week."}
{"text":"Their chicken sub is to die for , I actually called them back after I finished my meal to tell them how much I enjoyed it. I ordered it 3 or 4 times already and every bite is still as delicious . The delivery time is really quick , under 30 minutes every time ."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Le staff est très gentil. Les prix sont très raisonnables et la poutine, malgré que ce soit du fromage rapé, est vraiment délicieuse, car le secret est dans la sauce gravy!

On va y retourner c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Attentive and friendly staff.  Next time I will try the Greek food.  Highly recommend if you have a craving for good pizza!"}
{"text":"The best. Their poutine is unparalleled. If you are looking for late-night drunk munch, this is the place for you. They deliver delicious food until 2am and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"A good spot to have a greasy sub or pizza on the way home from a club/bar at 3am. Fast service. Fast delivery if needed. I think they work 24/7 - never seen them closed. 

A must have on your fridge."}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal and a good deal too. The cheese is melted on the poutine which is key. Delivered to my house in 7mins. Can't beat that. RIP hope they come back."}
{"text":"This place has some great poutine. Their poutine is very different from other places in that their cheese are not in curds or curdy at all, it is melted goodness.

They also have great subs. This is place you would go if you are not sober or you are craving unhealthy and comfort food. 

Staff is pretty nice and like i said, food is above average compared to other fast food places. Just wish they would stop increasing their price."}
{"text":"4:59 AM delivery FOR THE WIN.

The food is tasty enough (although certainly nothing special) and the delivery is amazingly quick.

My biggest gripes are that there's really not much that's healthy to order (although I suppose that's not the point) and some of the food is really overpriced for what you get.  Stay away from the mozzarella sticks - the quality is poor, the portion is small and they charge way too much for what you get."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and we ordered take out based on a suggestion from a hotel staff member.  it was less than a 4 minute walk from my hotel and when i reached the restaurant I waited less than 10 minutes for my food.  The restaurant was clean and the elder gentleman behind the counter was very attentive and courteous.  The prices were reasonable and the food was good. My only complaint was that the fries were a bit under cooked but the portions were a good size.  After over spending on 'so-so' food it was nice to have a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Seriously needs to put more salt in their food. I only come here during late nights when everything else is closed. Thr serving size is huge, the delivery is fast and efficient. But the food doesn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Fresh food, simple menu, and very affordable. The service is fast and efficient. Classic US/Italian fares. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"The poutine isn't completely legit (they use pizza cheese instead of cheese curds) but it is completely delicious. 

The chicken and bacon poutine is my favorite, tastes amazing after a night out. 

Get it delivered, they accept cash or credit card at the door."}
{"text":"I stop by this restaurant from time to time, usually the food is good , but on the last visit i did not place the order and i left the restaurant with 4 of my friends due to the horrible  greeting and service that we received from the waitress  who usually work at night.

*First of all we chose  a table by our self because she was standing in the back and ignoring us .
*Second without even saying hi she brought  the menus and threw them  on the table  , there was one menu missing she brought it and literally  throw it on me , that was very rude and unpolite.

At this point we decided to leave , we stood  up and said thx we wont order tonight , well  she gave us hell attitude  and said: it is better .
 Definitely  we wont go back again"}
{"text":"The delivery is quick, and the guy is nice. They pick up the phone pretty quickly. 

However the mist important part for a restaurant is its taste. I would say the taste is just OK.
I ordered wings and cheese pizza. The wings are not very crispy (maybe because of the delivery...), and there are too much tomato sause, and the flavour of the cheese is very plain.

But one good thing is that they open everyday, and until very very late.

Overall, this is not a have to try restaurant, but it is good when you are too lazy to cook while other restaurants are already closed."}
{"text":"i had a chicken sandwich and my friend had a cheeseburger.  they were weird on the phone, but very fast (the fries were still crunchy by the time they delivered).  My friend thought the burger had a weird texture, but my chicken sandwich was pretty awesome.

PLEASE make your own ranch dressing.  No one so far in Montreal understands the concept of good homemade ranch.  Do your part to keep fat American tourists happy :D"}
{"text":"I highly dislike this place. Located in the middle of the McGill ghetto, it is a local Montreal style diner that serves late night food to a huge student population. It is very popular amongst students but I really don't understand why. 

Their poutines are made with soggy fries, shredded cheese (no cheese curds!!!) and a very bland sauce. Their pizzas tastes like store bought pizza dough with some vegetables and processed meat added to it. I have yet to have something that tastes good from Alto. I definitely do not recommend, if you are craving late night food, you are better off with chef on call down the street."}
{"text":"Didn't think the food was anything spectacular, but it was a nice place to sit, eat, escape the cold, and watch a hockey game on TV. Very convenient that its open late, too!"}
{"text":"A good late-night spot
but fine for lunch too.  Service
and food are both great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday, and it is a pure example of the good and the, well, mediocre. As far as the service, it was great. The server was on top of everything and always pre-bused. However, I was charged extra by the server. When I ordered a combo I was told that he came with a soda. I asked if I could replace it with bottled water instead (I don't drink soda), and the server said yes. However, I was charged for it. As far as the food, as other people have said it is basically bar food. I had a gyro plate with fries. The gyro was similar to Grecian Delight (didn't seem to be off a spit) and the fries had no salt. The meal was average...not great or bad, just average. However, because of the service, I am willing to give this place another try and see what they recommend."}
{"text":"This cool little diner was my last stop from a fantastic weekend in Montreal. I wanted to try a food staple of Montreal, which is the Poutine. So my friends and I all ordered a different poutine and try each others. The regular, which tasted pretty decent, the chicken and bacon, which was a little bland because of the chicken, and the trio meat, which was probably the best out of all three. The cheese on all three were very stretchy, the type you find on pizza. We also had some house beer. The lady was very nice, even though we spoke no French, and she spoke a decent amount of English. I always try to speak the native language, but failed horribly. The prices are decent, but the beers were pretty expensive, I think the mugs are half the normal size, so ordering two is really getting one beer, which ends up being $7."}
{"text":"Stumbled in for some late nite food while in town for the jazz fest.

Downtown doesn't have many late nite food options (that I've found, at least), but this place is open til 4am on weekends, and serves decent sub/sangwich fare. BLT, ham and cheese sub and fried mozzarella sticks were all serviceable."}
{"text":"I live super close to Altos and I order in on snowy and rainy days all the time when I'm feeling lazy. The poutine is decent and so is the burger. Kind of expensive for what you get, but they deliver late and fill you up if you're in a bind. I'll always keep coming back for the service above all else!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was good. The owner was very friendly and made us feel very welcome as tourists. It was nearly midnight and he was still upbeat and hospitable."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm american so here is my opinion of food/service.

I ordered from here 3 times to my hotel room at the Lord Berri hotel.  They are wicked fast delivery.  Star for that.  

Their pizza is passable and for 2am food, its the bees knees.  But only at 2am.  Star for that.

The fries suck delivered.  

The wings are overpriced.  I consider anything over a dollar per wing excessive.

The subs are weird, gross and overpriced.  I was able to eat the chicken parm but it stuck with me awhile.  The signature steak sub  special was horrid.

The cheeseburger was ok."}
{"text":"This place is old school and full of undergraduate late night memories. Open late and with fast delivery, Altos answers the desperate munchie driven cry of Montrealers small and wide. Eating in is, you know... brightly lit, tough waitresses with sideways smiles, plastic chairs, big pitchers of \"beer\" (no options. just beer.) and that classic Montreal mix of GreektalianQuebcooking that hits the heart just right. 10 inch pepperoni sub with piles of greek salad on top? Check. Lasagne gratine? Check. Gyro trio to go? You know you want to. And even though Altos doesn't do the best of any of these things, I always somehow end a meal from here grinning and weirdly satisfied."}
{"text":"Good pizza.Timely delivery. Hassle free. Convenient ass hell!  

Do it!"}
{"text":"I can best describe this as \"drunk food\". If you're drunk and it's late and you don't have a ton of money, this is a good bet. A mish mash of different types of food. Again, perfect of you're drunk with a crowd. 

Chicken pita was smothered in sour cream. The spaghetti with meat sauce was totally overlooked and poorly drained. There was water on the plate."}
{"text":"Decent meat lover's pizza. Good place for a 2 AM snack downtown."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get food after 12am. Spent many drunken nights here in first year. Get the poutine or fish n' chips and it'll cure any hangover. Waiters are all pretty friendly! 

(Just don't let your overly wasted friend puke cuz they weren't too happy about that one.)"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place MANY times over the years, they're one of my favourites for cheap, quick food. There's a bit of variation in quality; the omelettes, burgers, and sandwiches are great, the salads not so much. But their delivery speed is exceptional, and they're a solid good-value choice."}
{"text":"The service is fast and the food is good for the price, pretty ample menu so everyone should be able to find something they like."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Altos so many times it's not even funny. If you want late night delivery, this place is for you. Honestly everything tastes just OK and we've tried almost everything on the menu. But this place isn't trying to be anything it isn't. I would say order if you're in a bind or really love pub food. The staff and reception is really friendly though. My partner usually likes the burgers and if we make any special requests ie fries well done they always do it right. Very prompt service.

Bottom line: food isn't great but it's not pretending to be. Really friendly staff and quick delivery. Open late."}
{"text":"On y va quand? Quand on est affamé et qu'aucune autre alternative ne s'offre à nous. Sinon, on évite les galettes de boeuf haché en carton et gélatine (leur texture me font imaginer ce que ce mélange assez insolite pourrait donner si on mettait le tout dans un mélangeur avec de l'eau et du bouillon brun) ainsi que les frites insipides qui nous font même regretter de ne pas plutôt avoir mis des Mc Cain au four et ainsi, économiser."}
{"text":"Terrible service on delivery. Ordered at midnight to get a pasta without a single hint of salt. 

Eating in their service is average. Most items are blunt but edible. Overall, the place can be summed up as an overpriced ghetto diner."}
{"text":"Aside from the great food and prompt delivery, I am here for the guy who answers the phone. The sweetest man in the world, always reassuring me that they can do anything you want at altos. Love this guy!"}
{"text":"First time, and got take out - not too bad! Food was ready promptly, and the fries weren't overly soggy. The wings were pretty decent (though they are breaded). Service is friendly, and the pricing is great. Not much in the way of ambiance, but, that's not what you go to Alto for."}
{"text":"Alto is a premium late late night location. If you are in their area, their late night deliveries are well worth it. The Veal Parmigiana sub is a must."}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab drunk bites, but really nothing more than that. They deliver and are open till 4-5am, which I think is their best appeal. I thoroughly enjoy their vegetarian poutine, and other poutines in general, but only when I am not in my sober state of mind. Their poutines are very soupy - lots and lots of gravy that is not as thick as what I am used to. Many of my friends find this gross, but I actually really like it!"}
