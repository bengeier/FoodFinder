{"text":"We went to the Beach Club a lot when it first opened.   They've always had good food and drink but at a price.  An example was Friday night.  During Happy hour we had a bowl of soup, wedge salad, the meatball, 2 beers and a glass of iced tea.   Without happy hour prices the bill with tip would have been $50.  

Years ago there was a problem getting a seat at the bar on a Friday night.  That's not the case now."}
{"text":"We love going here!  It is our go to place.  We love having such a creative chef using quality ingredients practically in our back yard.  There is always something new to try - both in foods and beers! There is a terrific week day lunch special and happy hour that makes it not only an incredible meal, but crazy affordable as well.  Wonderful atmosphere, almost always terrific service, and of course, great food!"}
{"text":"We walked in took a look at the menu saw the ridiculous prices and walked right out. Sports bar atmosphere. If ya wanna pay those prices for nothing special food in an atmosphere of loud TV screens go for it! And it's not like your in the Bahamas folks. Your in the freaken Concord Plaza! Yuck."}
{"text":"So, we came here a few years ago and had a bad experience with the service and the food. Fast forward to 2012 - we decided to give the Grill another try - it was good. We continued to patronize the Grill and even told friends that we enjoyed it!  Huh, what a HUGE mistake! We went with our neighbors who were VERY reluctant but were willing to try again. To say it was a disaster is being kind. The manager Mike (yes YOU MIKE) was a total jerk. We waited a good hour for our food and my husband who ordered a sirloin burger, got his order WITHOUT the burger!  What a total joke this place is! The manager MIKE (yes YOU MIKE) is a first class worthless idiot!  
There are plenty if other good places that would be delighted to have our business!  
I felt sorry for the waitress who had to put up with pathetic MIKE (yes YOU MIKE)!
Do yourself a favor and patronize somewhere other than the Grill."}
{"text":"Bean burger was a bit too spicy. Custom salad order was prepared wrong but fixed immediately."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years.  I am shocked at some of these reviews.  We have NEVER had a bad experience either with the service or the food.  The \"dinner at dusk\" is an unbelievable deal even though they did have to increase the price.  My only complaint is I'm cheap and don't like paying  $8-9 for a glass of wine, but that's anywhere.  Too bad for these awful experiences!  We will continue to patron this restaurant because it is just that good!"}
{"text":"Somewhat tucked away in a strip plaza, the Beach Club is clearly a favorite of the local crowd.  Good sandwiches, a big beer selection and friendly, helpful wait staff make for a fun experience and a reasonable value.  They do a good job with the fries and wings.  Also, the mac and cheese got our vote.  If you're looking for someplace a bit off the beaten track with a casual atmosphere, this place may well fill the bill."}
{"text":"It's consistent. I like the specials. Try the desserts, a pastry chef on site. This is no joke. Talk about wine, beer or bourbon selection. Take your time and enjoy the evening. Live music Friday and Saturday night.
I'm partial to the Mediterranean salad with blackened salmon. That's my standard dish, but on occasion I can be convinced to eat the delicious smoked wings with their homemade sweet potato fries. You won't find a bad dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Super delicious. One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Great place!  Awesome food and beverages coupled with excellent service and fun live music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent and the selection of local draft beers was awesome. Servers were friendly."}
{"text":"We have been customers of this restaurant for a few years. We absolutely love their pizza. However, we will NEVER return to this restaurant again.  We met friends (also frequent diners) for am impromptu Thursday night dinner.  Thursdays at Beach Club are retail wine Thursdays. As we were choosing our wine ($10 off bottles of wine) we noticed that the menu included a line that said that $20 gift cards would be issued on any bottle purchased over $40. We immediately did the math and decided on a wonderful $45 bottle of wine. The gift card could only be used on a later visit ( no problem as we were regulars). When our bill came we noticed the $10 hadn't been removed and we asked he waitress about the gift card. Even though she heard our thinking process as we ordered the wine, she told us...now..that we couldn't have both promotions. This was not specified ANYWHERE in the menu. When I spoke with the manager, Nicole, she conceded that the menu would need to be changed to reflect this exclusion but was completely unwilling to honor the mistake, even if it meant losing a repeat customer. I even called the owner of this restaurant and Beach Club Bistro in Euclid and he was even less amiable.  He asked why we would deny him the chance to make a living. Really, for a bottle of wine mark-up 100%? For $20, to lose a customer? Terrible customer service! We were not trying to get something for nothing, just trying to get them to honor what is in print.  My guess is it will change tomorrow."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for a girls night with my two sisters and we had a great time! The beachin tacos with ahi tuna and the chicken fresco melt were amazing! In addition to the great food, the live music by the Erin Rossi band made the atmosphere so much fun!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with excellent service! Great place to have a party! Pizza is to die for!! All of the people working were there for whatever we needed and made sure the whole party was happy! They even helped with decorating. Patio looks great and we were able to get several pictures outside :) thank you beach club!"}
{"text":"The special was lobster pizza. Normally, my husband and I split. Not tonight. We each got our own. His regular crust and mine gluten free."}
{"text":"The pizzas are spectacular! Consistently good service and nice atmosphere. Love that it's nearby!"}
{"text":"Wow! Nice place, going in figured it was gonna just be a bar food joint. I was completely stunned by the menu choices. I ended up going with the hot wings (yeah bar food I know). The description was enticing. Smoked hot wings! Had to try them. Sauce was very hot (good hot, not shock value hot) and the meaty wings were plump, juicy and had an excellent smoky flavor. Definitely a top 3 in my wing favorites. 

The wife had the chicken picata. From the nibble I had it was very a robust flavor pallet going on there. 

Service was very friendly and accommodating, with excellent recommendations from our server Flo. 

Entertainment was the WIXY 1260's. Good band and not an ear blaster.

Great dining experience. Highly recommend this hidden gem in Concord Ohio."}
{"text":"First time here and we had no reservations for a Saturday night.  Hostess went out of her way to find us a seat on the patio.  Waitress was personable and friendly.  The cook and the bartender exhibited a level of expertise I really did not expect.

My wife was not real hungry and ordered from the \"Starter\" list.  She had the Tuna Putanesca.  The serving size was perfect, and Terri remarked that the chef was excellent in understanding the importance of including an anchovy when preparing the sauce.  She ordered the Peach Sangria.  I tasted it, and it was the first time I could say I really like Sangria.

I just ordered a small Pepperoni Pizza.  It was good.  I asked for a Cuba Libre and got the old fish eye.  Quickly changed my order to rum and coke with a wedge of lime.  ;o)  It was the perfect accompaniment to my pizza so I ordered a second.  This time the bartender thankfully held back on the Coke.  ;o)

And we had live music and a wonderful breeze to make the evening nearly perfect.

As we walked out, knowing the excellence of the bartender, my wife remarked that this would be a great place to come to just for a cocktail in the evenings.  I have a very observant wife."}
{"text":"Whenever my wife wants to go and have a nice dinner out she always suggest the beach club Grill which is about 5 miles from my house. They've drunk a lot of money into their back patio which is now covered and it's actually quite pleasant to sit out there as the lighting makes it very welcoming and not nearly as sterile as they took down all of the ballpark lighting. My favorite dish to get there is the pad thai with chicken. It's basically thai spaghetti but man oh man is it good.   

My wife and I with a bottle of wine and she had a fish special that they were offering that night, I am NOT one to eat fish and I can't comment on its taste but the wife says it was delicious.

The server talk to him to getting dessert which was a cannoli and I'm glad she did that.  We got two of them that were drizzle and chocolate and we inhale them both. My wife fully intended to take the second one home to have it later yeah right like that would even happen. Only downside is that beach club Grill has gotten quite pricey as our tab that night was almost $90. But, you get what you pay for and it was a great meal with a nice atmosphere and a great server. My only real gripe was the price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You can tell the food is very fresh. There is a lot of variety. I eat mostly a Paleo diet and they had zucchini/squash noodles and that made me super excited. Service was friendly and quick. Good selection of beer! Stop in :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all! Stopped by with some friends and tried everything from a calamari appetizer to clam linguine and pad thai entrees to thin crust pizza to-go to name a few. Some plates offered large portions and the food was good, (however nothing to rave about). Prices seem to be in the moderate to a little pricey range. Staff was friendly. Atmosphere seemed to be of a slightly classy sports bar, and they had a good band come in which was nice on a Saturday evening. 

Definitely a 3.5 star place that I'd possibly visit again if in the area, I'm just not rounding up since there was an incident where they wrongly charged tax on to-go food and the attempt to remedy the situation was confusing and left me with overpaying."}
{"text":"My friend and I had an absolutely horrid experience here, from the service to the food, and I felt compelled to share my experience with others in the hopes that they'll chose another establishment worthy of their business!

It was a Tuesday evening, one that I would consider rather slow (it was us and one other party of 6 in the dining room that had arrived after us), so our horrible service and experience can not be attributed to a crowd.

When we were sat, we were informed that they were out of one of their sides, which was disappointing, but things happen, so we'll make due. We placed an order for salads first and when they did arrive, that's when the real underwhelming began. My $6 wedge salad was BROWN around the edges and the few cherry tomatoes cut in half and sprinklings of some bacon crumbles and blue cheese were poor excuses for toppings. Not what is expected out of a $6 salad. My friend's house salad was nothing more than greens with a few craisins. I should have sent my salad back for sure, but I was so hungry, I ate overlooked it and ate it- my first mistake (besides dining here.)

We placed our order- mine the half chicken with garlic mashers and sauteed spinach and my friend the baked brie appetizer. I ordered the lemon aoli as an side sauce, and the waitress recommended the cider reduction as well, so I took advantage of the recommendation. 

A few minutes after ordering, I was informed they were out of the half chicken, but the chef would substitute two chicken breasts instead. I was extremely disappointed, but I just went with it since I didn't feel like looking over the menu again.)

When our entrees arrived, we were stunned. My mashed potatoes had been MICROWAVED after being plated- I know what microwaved potatoes look and taste like- they appeared crater-like and had this extreme heat that is only achieved from fresh out of the microwave. I was appalled. I tried the spinach, which had absolutely no flavor to them either (a little garlic or lemon would not have hurt!), and of course, no salt or pepper on our tables, or any in the restaurant for that matter. 

My friend's \"baked brie\" was nothing more than a 4\" round of microwaved brie with some pizza dough, stale dried dates, marmalade in a plastic cup and a few nuts- what a joke. 

When the waitress asked what was wrong, I explained this to her and she said she'd left the chef know. Not really too concerned, but more out of obligation. Oh, and I didn't get my cider reduction she so happily recommended- they were out! Of course! And my lemon aioli? Tasted more like generic Hidden Valley Ranch. Another joke. 

We managed to eat what we could muster and when the waitress eventually came back with the check, she informed me that she talked to the chef and he said \"the potatoes were fresh and there was nothing wrong with the spinach.\" So, basically calling me a liar and not concerned that their food is mediocre at best. 

There is no excuse for a restaurant being virtually out of EVERYTHING, waitstaff that is not concerned with guests' food, and then not correcting anything when the guests are clearly unhappy- for valid reasons. 

There are plenty, PLENTY of other places in Lake County that continuously serve up fantastic food with even better service, at a fraction of what Beach Club Charges. Patronize those- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cute local place with a great bar and enjoyable music on the weekends.  It's too bad the service is not so great!  We walked in and stood for at least 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the rude hostess who proceeded to talk on the phone and turn her back to us.  When she finally spoke to us she rudely suggested that we give her our name and sit at the bar if we didn't have reservations. She was very short with us and huffy like we were bothering her.  We ended up standing at the bar and eventually got seats there.  We decided to stay and eat at the bar when 45 minutes later it seemed our name was lost as there were open tables and yet we weren't buzzed.  We ordered the special and after 20 minutes of waiting for our food were told they were out.  It just continued downhill from there..."}
{"text":"The Beach Club is under new ownership/management, and that's a great thing! I have frequented this place for years and am always happy with the food. The menu has changed a little, for the better, and the service is starting to improve also. The pricing remains a bit high in my opinion.

The tuna tacos are to die for and I find myself craving them! The pizza is excellent as are their burgers. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their bread pudding. The salads have always been good, but occasionally over dressed. I have never had a bad dish here. 

The atmosphere is casual comfortable with trendy decor and nice clean bathrooms. The patio is private and beautiful in the summer with a bar outside as well. The bands on the weekends sometimes are a bit loud. People do go to dance and that area can be a bit congested. There is a dining room side for quieter ambiance. 

Overall, I really like this place and am a regular. I'd like to see the prices down a bit though. I highly recommend trying The Beach Club!

Disappointed tonight... the food was excellent and the service just as good! I'm just shocked at the prices and shrinking/ inconsistent serving sizes. I ordered a fish taco app that I always get and don't think there was 2 oz of tuna on the plate. The rest or the ingredients are raw veges and the price was $13. My friends who ordered the same got more tuna with theirs, so inconsistent. That and two glasses of wine for $30 is just too high. My girlfriend got a gluten free pizza, uncharged and smaller than a 10\" dinner plate, and one glass of wine for $22. Need to do a price adjustment to get the stars upgraded again... otherwise, doing a good job. Don't like the shrinking servings and growing prices"}
{"text":"Went there from out of town.  Sat at the bar.  Everyone was friendly, service was good, food was good not great.  Prices are reasonable.  Would go back but not my favorite. 
Maybe for the price I should go back sooner."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Server had the whole bar area to himself so was busy, but very nice. Had the artichoke appetizer, which was awesome. For dinner had the margharita pizza, it was ok, prob wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dinner! I have had wonderful experiences here. The food is consistent and delicious but better yet, they accommodate me often when I have dietary restrictions. I will often change up my order and the chef will make something that I can have. The wine and bourbon selection is outstanding. I'm certain you won't find better elsewhere. 

New Years Eve is the best when Chef can have some fun. Book early!!"}
{"text":"Food is alright, but the service and ownership is horrific. They have zero understanding of customer service and taking care of the customer. After being a regular for nearly 5 years and lackluster service I've had enough and found a new place to frequent."}
{"text":"Let's go to the beach!! You've gotta look for this place. In a little strip mall tucked away by some other places but once you get inside it opens up. Plenty of seating but preferred is outside. The patio areas are very nice. Fence so you don't see anything beyond and plenty of well appointed plants makes it very appealing. We had salads, wings, pizza, and my choice of smoked meatloaf, which I throughly enjoyed. The smoked wings and meat loaf had a delicately smoked flavor. The pizza was enjoyable and the caprese salad was fresh and presented very nicely. Menu was diverse and specials sounded good. Large beer, wine, and cocktails menu. Our server was very friendly and a timely delivery of our order."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience!  Very nice, casual atmosphere and the staff seems eager to please.  Superior wine and beer offerings and the food was very good.  Best of all is that it was all delivered at a reasonable price.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the Beach Club last night. Our waiter, Dave, was outstanding. There were 6 of us and everybody loved their meal."}
{"text":"The WORST place I have ever been.  Had reservations for Saturday night to celebrate birthdays and listen to the band.  Wife specifically asked that we have a table close to the stage.  That didn't happen, we got a booth near the front of the restaurant with no view of the band.  The Hostess was the most surly and rude woman I ever met, that is until we met the Manager.  Why did we have the misfortune to meet these two people? Because after we finished our meal, we got up to see if there was an open table near the band, but when we saw a reserved sign on it, we went back to our original booth.  That was when the Hostess asked us quote \"What were we doing sitting in this booth?\"  Then they TOLD US we had to leave because they had another reservation for it.

I travel for a living and average 600 restaurant meals a year, and in 15 years (9,000 restaurant experiences),  I have NEVER BEEN BUM-RUSHED like we were tonight.

Oh, and the food was mediocre at best.  Avoid this dump like the plague."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars. Food meh, service pretty bad. 

We arrived with friends of ours who were treating us to dinner. They had a reservation and had to tell 2 different hosts this fact before we were led to the dining room. Ooops! There's no 4-top open in the dining room. So back we go to the front to wait. Then they basically stole two 2-tops from a big group and made a table for us from scratch. But there really wasn't room for it so we were basically sitting out in the middle of a walkway and on top of two other tables. My chair was so uncomfortably close to a lady from another table that she actually got up and moved to the other side of the table. 

We were never offered water even after our server finally noticed us and were asked what we'd like to drink but were never brought a drink/beer menu. Overall very clueless, inattentive service.

The food: 
Two of us got the fish fry - I'm always in search of a good fish fry and usually never find it. Not here either. It was haddock which was breaded and fried but the fish was very overcooked - it shouldn't have the texture of meat. Green beans were undercooked - I like 'em a little crunchy as much as the next guy but these were borderline raw. Fries were decent but nothing amazing. 

One of the guys got the Porky Pie pizza which he said was pretty good and the other got the special which was 'smoked beer can chicken mac and cheese'. It did sound good and it came out looking pretty awesome. We all tried it and it was tasty, but for me it would be WAY too rich for a main dish and I probably could only have eaten a quarter of the plate. 

Overall, this place was not so great which sucks because we've been to the Beach Club Bistro several times and had very good experiences there. Three stars is generous for this trip given the really crappy service and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I came here for my birthday dinner recently. We wanted to try a new place we haven't been after learning our intended restaurant was closed for the holidays. There's a good selection of drinks and cocktails. A variety of food on the menu. I got the Brookwood Club pizza - delicious! Though the crust reminded me slightly of Pizza Hut's, you could tell the ingredients were much fresher. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ pork sandwich - he said it was good but \"nothing special.\" Looking through the menu, seems like they had really good happy hour deals (which we had just missed).

Service was a little slow but it was also during dinner on a Saturday night. Overall, seems like a good local place. Not sure if we would go there again on our own though, as my boyfriend would give this 3 or 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times, never disappointed.

Sometimes if you're in the bar area music and noise it's a little loud but the food is always amazing.

In the main dining room, the menu replicates the original location in Euclid's menu. But as my wife says, don't get the lobster ravioli, it ain't that great!

Tons of great choices on the menu the Vasj pizza is always a great choice."}
{"text":"Listen I'm a long time eater of these places the one in Euclid and also now I live in concord I go here . Food is always good,  Always. I've never have a bad meal . But service is another story , it's More or Less always just ok . I don't know why they can't get going and stay on path of getting the servers to attend to the customer batter without being annoying but still attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service to match, and a decent variety to fit every taste. My favorite is the Pad Thai, which can be customized to fit your dietary needs or preferences. Never have been disappointed here."}
{"text":"This is a great place with good food, good staff, and great beer and drink selection.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but wether you sit inside or on the cute patio you will love it. They have good specials and seasonal drinks. Pizzas a great along with everything else I've tried."}
{"text":"Duplicates menu of its parent, Beach Club Bistro in Euclid. Pizza, big salads, somewhat inventive entrees  -- salmon in horseradish crust with scallops. Excellent wine selection. 

Recently opened and suffering teething pains: Our booth lacked a floor -- coming soon, they said, so it was very uncomfortable. Bread didn't arrive until near the end of the meal -- and that meal took awhile to arrive. Waitress showed up after some time to ask if she could bring our appetizers after our dinner salads because the kitchen was running slow. We said OK. Five or 10 minutes later, she was back ... with our appetizers, not salads. 

Our favorite appetizer -- a mashed potato pizza -- lacked some of the fluffiness of the Euclid original. But one that was new to us -- artichokes stuffed with herbed cream cheese, lightly breaded with Panko crumbs and fried -- was delicious.

Mediterranean salad -- olives, sweet onions, capicolla -- tasty, too much to eat in one sitting. Caprese -- tomatoes, avocado and breaded, lightly fried fresh mozzarella -- suffered from tomatoes so unripe that they were almost crunchy, and a dressing that was all olive oil mildness, no vinegary tang."}
