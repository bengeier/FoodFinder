{"text":"Super nice staff with very reasonable prices.  If you are looking for a great local pizza delivery from a non-chain restaurant, I highly recommend you give them a try.  And don't forget the mozzarella sticks on the side-they're delicious!"}
{"text":"We were working on a home improvement project this weekend, so our kitchen was a complete mess. We don't usually order delivery and we weren't sure what was around, so we went to Yelp to find a pizza place that delivers. Leone's came up on the list. We had never heard of them, but we decided to give it a try. The one review they had sounded good and the photos looked good, too. We were so pleased with our experience that we ended up ordering the following day too since our kitchen still was not back to cooking order. Delivery was fast and everyone was happy with the food. We will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza shop!  We ordered a large pie with pepperoni and mushrooms and it turned out well.  Prompt delivery.  It's now my favorite pizza in the twin boro area, and it's nice that it's close to our house in Verona.  Tucked away on Plum St, it's a bit hidden from the boulevard but easy to get to once you know it's there!"}
