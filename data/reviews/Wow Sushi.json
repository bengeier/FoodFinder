{"text":"This was my first time at Wow! Sushi on a Saturday evening. It is a small quaint restaurant and we were greeted by the staff as soon as we walked in. 

We ordered sea urchin (uni) sushi, japango roll, louis roll, and wow roll. I was amazed by the sea urchin roll and louis roll, the other two were okay. I was impressed by the freshness of the fish as well as the excellent service we received. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation, fresh fish, quick service- fastest sushi place I've been to that delivers quality goodness. Price is more than reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"I try Sushi wherever I go, and the best sushi I have EVER had has, and still is, in Halifax Canada. That being said, this place was banging. For Toronto, the prices were actually really reasonable, and the portions were great. The menu isn't huge, and neither is the actual restaurant (very tiny actually), but they make amazing sushi, and the ice cream is awesome. I was super super happy that immediately upon sitting down and getting our menus, we were give fresh, hot, delicious green tea. Green tea with Sushi is a must, so this was great. I would highly recommend before going anywhere else, as I searched high and low, and the prices are awesome, and all the high ratings aren't a lie."}
{"text":"Traditional sushi restaurant with excellent presentation. Very pleased with the quality here! Every element of the meal was well above average in freshness, flavour, and preparation. My dining partners were impressed with the variety delivered in the sushi dinner, and I think the avocado cucumber roll was the best I have ever tasted. (Yes, they have some vegetarian options, including the miso soup.)

Sadly, not accessible, as they have several stairs out front. Inside is small."}
{"text":"My top sushi spot all time. Very quality food (comparable to Japango) but at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Don't deserve 4 stars can't compete with Ichiriki nearby. 

Operated by Chinese. Pricy+small rolls+very thin sashimi slice+unfriendly service.

The only good thing is their fish quality is above average. Do bring your cash!"}
{"text":"Went to order take out at this place.
When we arrived home, we saw that the salad portions were too small and there was hair in the food.
It happened before that when I ordered take out, at home I saw that the portions were smaller than served at the restaurant. One I ordered Sashimi and instead of 5 pieces, there were only 3 pieces of sashimi.
I used to love this place, but the quality has gone down pretty fast.
Never going back."}
{"text":"It was my first time tried wow sushi. We ordered salmon dinner which was a bit salty, and service was good."}
{"text":"Not to sound cheesy..but WOW!  I love all the restaurants that rooted from Japango. Not only are the fish and rice fresh, high quality, and always tasty, Wow Sushi really gets customer loyalty.  My husband and I were dining at Yuzu for years and then we found Wow.  Their prices are lower, the dining area is small like Japango, and they DELIVER!  They've delivered delicious sushi to our downtown condo, our wedding, and when we moved to the East end, they continue to deliver to our home.  They've earned my loyalty hands down and I would recommend them to any of my friends."}
{"text":"More like meh sushi not wow sushi. Their deluxe rolls are pretty small compared to other places I've been to. They don't have much selection on their menu either. I wasn't at all impressed with the rolls. This place isn't really my vibe but if you have a hankering for sushi and you're in the area, they'll do. Yeah, a little disappointed."}
{"text":"WoW Sushi is purely WOW! 
A small, quaint, clean restaurant located on Charles St with a super friendly Japanese staff. 
All their dishes look stunning and are specially decorated using high quality ingredients that present diverse flavours to tickle your palette. I ordered the sashimi dinner and their fish cuts all had a very unique taste - a memorable fish was one that had a smoky flavour to it, very delish. The Tuna Tar Tar Appetizer was also quite good as well, not sure if threes anything bad here. Definitely a little more expensive than other Jap restaurants in the area but you're paying for quality and an authentic experience which is very worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Nice and cozy inside, but not a lot of seats."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: This is a sweet, family-run place that makes good sushi at an ok price (for Montreal, in which all sushi is expensive when compared to other places, like Vancouver). 

I've eaten in restaurant and also ordered delivery from this place. The restaurant is nothing fancy or special, but they are extremely polite and decently quick. The delivery always arrives within a reasonable amount of time and they have now joined just-eat.ca, which makes it particularly easy to order without errors or confusion.  Their food is tasty and portions are fair (unlike so many sushi places in Montreal that really skimp on certain ingredients, like avocado). They have pretty creative rolls, my favorite being the kayaku. The tempura is perfect and the miso is tasty. One downside is that they seem to put the spicy sauce in the majority of the rolls, so if you don't like spicy sauce, your options really diminish."}
{"text":"It's super popular and it can get really busy.  The sushi was fresh and the presentation was great.  But because it is always so crowded and the restaurant is so small, it really can ruin the atmosphere. I prefer a more quiet and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"The side dishes were quick to serve and the staff were very friendly. Apart from sashimi, I'd recommend Japango rolls to everyone going to this place."}
{"text":"Have eaten in, and have ordered for delivery many times (delivery is prompt).

This sushi is eyes-roll-back-in-your head good. Especially the butterfish and BC tuna. I literally have to close my eyes at times while consuming it just to make the moment last.

Rice is perfectly prepared, melt in your mouth, and really demonstrates the difference between WOW and your average sushi joint.

Never had anything less than ridiculously delicious sushi from WOW! Honestly the best thing this side of Sushi Kaji. Can not recommend enough."}
{"text":"Stopped by for takeout tonight. Prompt and very friendly service with a couple of free cans of pop thrown in. Chirashi sushi was beautifully presented, fresh and delicious. Tempura dinner was a generous portion of shrimp, crab cake and veggies and was nicely breaded and not greasy. Basic miso soup and iceberg lettuce salad. A great find and super convenient for takeout if you need to pick something up Manulife Centre."}
{"text":"The food is great at a reasonable price.  I always order their lunch specials coz my working place is very nearby. Service is also wonderful. The combo has 1 bowl of rice. 1 main food. 1 veggie salad and 1 miso soup. Just perfect for lunch. They always draw some funny patterns on the take out box."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot and went there at least 100 times. Great food (fresh fish, especially), reasonable price, good customer service, good location. 

However, the last 2 times, food gotten worse. Portion is smaller, fish is not as fresh, service is okay (a Japanese waiter girl is still great, though). 

I may be a bit too harsh because of prior great experience and high expectations, but given I spent so much money here, I think I only give them 2 stars at this point."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but two days later I become so disappointed when I realized my friend and I paid two times which was waitress ' s mistake. I explained to her I am paying for myself and my friend in a group of ten, however she git money from me and him as well. I never go back there and won't suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: Wow!

Simply put, this is one of the best, if not the best sushi place I've been to in the GTA. 

The maki rolls are phenomenal. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, the rolls are relatively smaller. But honestly, the superb taste compensates for the size. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. 

Recommendations: Alaska roll, Alaska roll (purposely repeated), salmon avocado. In fact, their maki dinner is fabulous. For $20, you get 24 rolls--dynamite, spicy salmon, spicy tuna and Alaska roll. 

Lastly, the service is fabulous. The owner/chef is a gem. A very nice person, the likes of which are seldom seen in today's service industry. 

Overall, it's a must try if you like sushi!  Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"Was there today, had lunch, and I have to say name of the restaurant suites the place. Fish is really fresh, and quality and presentation is really good. I am really impressed. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"the other reviews speak for themselves. Very good value for midrange sushi. Comparable to Japango and Yuzu no hana but at a lower price. 

Standouts to me are the small sushi boat and Tuna Tartare.

Fish is all fresh and i love the seared fish and anything with fried garlic on top, I'm drooling thinking about it..."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The quality of sushi for the price is good. The service though is not that great. They focus on getting you in and out. I went to lunch here... Order was taken from the bar, sushi plate came before I could even start my salad. 

Then waitress took away the miso soup while I was still having my sushi. I told her I am still having the soup. She put it back and no apology even as a courtesy.  

The bill and change given in the same careless manner.

Food is good but dinning experience is not."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, probably the best Chinese delivery in my area, it only took about half an hour even though just eat estimated an hour, but it gave me some wicked food poisoning. I've been sick for two days. My boyfriend seemed unaffected by it, so it could just be me I guess. Also it was pretty expensive and the delivery guy put the sushi on top of the noodles so by the time they got to my house it was hot which was super gross and potentially what made me sick... Oh well. Thought I had finally found a decent delivery place but I won't order from here again :("}
{"text":"I like this place?not expensive?and the food is very tasty?the service is nice?the chiefs are Chinese?but they are pretend to be a japanese speaker thats interesting?anyway this is my favorite sushi place"}
{"text":"The quality of the fishes were very good. However the portion was incredibly small. If you are a growing boy like me or an athlete. Do not go here because i had to come home and eat again in order to fullfill my hunger. I recommend other japanese restaurant such as tokyo sushi house on st. joseph and bay."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food because it still hasn't showed up! I ordered a huge order for the office and not only did they write down my number wrong but when I called after an hour they said they were on their way and have still failed to show up. Needless to say I am not allowed to order after hours dinner for my office. The real question is why would you fail to show up for a 100 piece order? Make no sense. Maybe I'm a little hangry too."}
{"text":"I hate to be cliche, but WOW. I went for lunch, and they have a really great lunch menu, where they serve well-priced combos from 11:30am-4:30pm. There was a sashimi lunch (14 pieces for $12), sushi lunch (8-piece spicy roll and 8 nigiris (raw sashimi on rice) for $12), chirashi lunch, etc. Prices for specials ranged from $10-$15, I think.

All lunch specials included salad, miso and hot tea. 

Service was slow, but they were very courteous, so I did not mind the slowness.

I ordered the sushi lunch. This place is set apart in the fact that they put out some nigiris I never saw before, and their spicy roll was the most delicious I ever had. It is not your typical spicy roll. It is very flavourful and actually quite spicy, and it is not greasy because the spiciness cuts through the creaminess well. They give you a lot of fresh fish in the maki aka. roll.

The nigiri...wow...I think they gave me 4 varieties...one variety was flamed, and one variety was topped with a bit of garlic oil, with tiny pieces of fried garlic. The fried garlic was amazing, because it was crispy and the oil really carried the scent and flavour of garlic. Another had very thin slivers of deep fried green onion, which was sweet, crunchy and went well with the fish and rice.

Their rice is also cooked very well; each grain is `alive` and they flavoured it well-subtly sweet and tangy. Portion is generous, and not only that, they give you some of the thickest and freshest pieces of fish on the nigiri. 

All that unique variety, portion and quality for $12....best deal ever.

Also, it is clean and cozy, and the tables are not oily, and nothing, including their menus, plates, etc. gives off a cheap vibe. Not good for groups, though. It is a small place with tables for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi lives up to its name. It might just be the best sushi restaurant in Toronto. The sushi is exceptionally fresh, the presentation excellent, the service is excellent. They welcome you on the way in and out. The prices are very reasonable. The chefs often come to your table to ask you about the food. They often throw in new a dish on larger orders. The only down side is the size of the restaurant is not large, perhaps 10 or so tables, and they do turn the tables over quickly. Its not a place to linger over your meal although they do not rush you. But in terms of the food, its as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite sushi restaurant... until new management. I went there recently and 80% of their menu tasted different. Tempura and some grilled sashimi tasted the same. But that's because it uses fire. It's a \"sushi\" restaurant; therefore, raw fish is the main dish. And, they weren't as good as before. A little disappointed. Also, the atmosphere changed."}
{"text":"Thats money grab, I barely can see the salmon inside of the sushi, and paid a lot, don't go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a few weeks ago and wasn't overly impressed. The service, location and shop are all good - but the food/sushi quality isn't the best. I would be willing to pay a bit more for better sushi and wouldn't recommend this location especially given the choice of food in this area."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi boat. Some sushi was uncommon so the Japanese server actively gave us a brief intro of what they are, what seasoning was sprinkled on the top and what sauce it should be eaten with. Sushi per se was good, sashimi was fresher than I expected, though the presentation can be greatly  improved."}
{"text":"It's not all you can eat, like my friend and I thought when we first walked in. The sushi was good. I like to try different places and they had a nice assortment of rolls and the service was good, overall I wouldn't go back because of how much it cost. But the food was really good so that's what brought it's rating back up for me."}
{"text":"We have been to this place 3 times so far. The last time I got a simple sashimi lunch, which was super fresh with perfectly cooked bowl of rice accompanying it. The fish was presented nicely, and there were none of the cheaper kind fish on the plate (some places include imitation crab meat, or clams or shrimp). Some of the fishes were seared on a pan for a moment to give them a nice texture on the outside. The plate was decorated with real leaves (not plastic grass) and flower. Presentation!
I was also surprisingly full even though I was quite hungry before we came. I did have room for a desert (but I suppose this is the right level of fullness after dinner - you should have space for desert and coffee).

I also appreciate the fact that everything is served in ceramic/glass plates/bowls, I hate the cheap plastic plates!

The green tea also was good (of course it is not proper Japanese sencha, but I suppose that would be to price to offer free and in refills). 

Service was attentive and fast. 

Sometime ago we went with our 2 year old son and was well accommodated and welcomed regardless of his hyperactivity. The owners even gave him some toys (the good fortune cats). :-)

I would say that for the quality the price is just right. Yes, there are more affordable sushi places in abundance in Toronto, but none that we have visited delivers the quality."}
{"text":"My first visit was terrific - very tasty... so back I went. Unfortunately on trip #2 I found a staple in my soup.
Their compensation was to offer me ice-cream. 
Also noticed they did nothing to replace the soup pot... they kept dishing it out.
Sorry Wow - I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Solid service and taste.

Didn't make a reservation Friday night but they were very attentive and got us seats right away in a very very busy atmosphere. We were first timers so we just went with sushi dinner for simplification. The plate was well presented and quality was excellent. Some sushi pieces seemed rushed but I'm sure you'll get better looking ones when they are less busy.

The quantity though is on the small side and one sushi dinner wasn't actually filling for me."}
{"text":"Very tiny place! I came during lunch time, got seated right away! The waiter brought me a miso soup and salad, which was yum. I ordered the Maki lunch I think, and it was super delicious and fresh! I will always come back to this place if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Fri night.  Ordered:
Negi Hamachi Maki- the highlight of the meal
Black Cod appetizer- a small, thin portion, not worth the price! 
Yakiniku - easily duplicated at home by cooking frozen hot pot beef slices from the Chinese supermarket.
Sushi appetizer - good quality, well formed nigiri
Japan Go Maki - not very memorable
Salmon and green onion maki - fresh, good proportion of rice to salmon
Washroom was very clean.  Service was pleasant but forgetful (took 2 reminders to get beverages).

Would probably not make a special trip, but if in the area and hungry, it might be worth a second try, especially for the raw fish (sushi, sashimi, maki) or lunch sets"}
{"text":"I've now had two meals at Wow Sushi and can say that it is the best Japanese food that I have had in the area so far. I particularly like their nabu yaki udon. The soup has so many ingredients and is so delicious. I will be back for more. Their sashimi is of excellent quality although slightly small in quantity."}
{"text":"Honestly? I've been having great service and amazing sushi. It's been super fresh and fast, and better than some of the other nigiri and chef's rolls in the plateau."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi find right by yonge and bloor.  Wow sushi had great yelp reviews so we tried it last night.  This place is reasonable, they were quick, nice and most importantly had amazing fresh sushi.  

The salmon and tuna was fantastic!  They are losing a star for their seaweed salad that was not so great."}
{"text":"Really wonderful basic traditional sushi place. The best sushi rice I've had. Very reasonable at least at lunch. Fish was fresh and delicious. Good service, cozy inside. Wish it was in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"So this is my first Yelp review! Went to Wow sushi for dinner this evening and I must say it was very good! Miso soup was great, salad wasn't to my taste. Ordered the Philadelphia roll and California roll. Salmon was fresh and the California roll was great! Servers were very friendly. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I found the restaurant to be too small and crammed. Food was well worth it, but didn't think they had enough on their menu."}
{"text":"Good food but service was horrible.  We didnt sat for long but the waitress kept trying to take our plates away despite we were taking our time to eat (ie literally asking us saying are you done every 2-3 min).  Made our experience extremely uncomfortable.. will not return."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience yesterday with my wife, and another couple plus their children. The staff was very friendly,  patient and accommodating from the moment we stepped foot inside,  and until we left the establishment. The only minor complaint I have is that it did take a little long for our table of 6 to receive all our dishes. But as I said,  only a minor inconvenience to what was to come...  THE FOOD! 

Service: 4/5

   My wife and I ordered the Yonge roll, Louis roll,  Chicken Karaage, Sushi pizza, and finally the Sashimi appetizer, which came out first. 

   I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't just a bland mishmash of the usual cuts you would get elsewhere. The salmon was nice and fatty,  the octopus had a nice,  soft,  yet meaty texture. The butterfish,  and the torched fish(sorry,  forgot to ask what it was) were the highlights of the dish.  It almost seems redundant,  but I cannot overstate how flavourful and buttery the butterfish. Hands down the best I've ever tasted. The smokey flavour from the torched fish provided an interesting contrast to all the other elements on this plate,  but did not overpower,  nor did it leave an unpleasant aftertaste you would experience with some torched foods. Definitely the highlight dish of the evening. 

   The Sushi pizza was the most disappointing aspect of our meal. I can see what they were going for,  but to me,  sushi pizza is about the generous portion of diced up salmon,  bathed in spicy mayo.  This iteration missed the mark for me,  but in the grand scheme of things,  it's not all that important. 

   The Karaage had the right 'crispy on the outside,  and tender in the inside' feel, when you pop it in your mouth, however, it tasted a little under-seasoned, and  rather,  generic. Definitely could have used another spice or seasoning to make it more interesting. All in all,  it was still enjoyable, and the crunchy texture was definitely a plus, but I've had better. 

   As for the Yonge and Louis rolls,  they had the perfect amount of rice to other ingredients ratio.  The use of chili oil vs your typical spicy mayo was an interesting choice. Part of  me was longing for that orange-coloured sauce that I'm used to,  but I appreciate that they are trying to be different here. In terms of taste, I thoroughly enjoyed every every bite,  but things started to blend together towards the end.  The flavour profiles and textures have a type of sameness to them,  that isn't necessarily a bad thing,  but definitely kept it from being elevated. I would have liked to have seen some variety of crunch! pop! or some star ingredient that would provide definition and distinction.  Overall  the experience was very good. Not too big,  not too small.  Not too dry,  not too saucy. Just right,  is what I would say. 

   I harken back to the Sashimi appetizer whereby the splendid experience left me wanting more  when it came to the rest of our food. That is not to say the food was disappointing,  it was not by any stretch of the imagination. It's just that the Sashimi set the bar so high. The Sushi pizza was the only disappointment, and while the Karaage, and rolls didn't completely WOW me(pun intended)  I can definitely recommend that others give this place a try,  as I'll definitely be back to sample  their other offerings, 

Food 4/5"}
{"text":"The sushi and service were good. But not up to the high Yelp rating expectation. The miso soup was my favorite part."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm obsessed with the Japango roll. It is a bit on the pricier end, but it's completely worth it. I have had their Katsudon and it's also fantastic. Their sushi is fresh and service is good. The only reason for the 4 star and not a 5 is that their place is a little TOO crowded. They definitely try to make use of every square centimeter that they have. 

Great for take out if you work or live near by however."}
{"text":"So... I took my husband to WOW sushi for his birthday based on all the amazing reviews. Unfortunately, we have been very spoiled with fresh sushi, having spent most of our time in Vancouver, BC. 

While I agree that the pieces of sushi were smaller, that didn't bother us that much. The rice was also better than some other Japanese restaurants here in Toronto - as per some reviews. But the overall quality was still not what we hoped for and was nowhere near Nao, Toshi, Hachibei, or Octopus Garden (among some of our regular go-to places in Vancouver - look them up if you're there!)

Other than the sushi dinner (12 pieces of sushi and a dynamite roll for $22 is a good deal), we also had the agedashi tofu and the yakinasu (which both used the exact same sauce and flavouring, so I wouldn't bother with the eggplant next time).  We also had the tempura moriawase; although the shrimp was great, for a lesser price, Tokyo Kitchen down the street does a much better variety of tempura (the only thing I like about them so far).

We ended our night with the ginger ice cream which was refreshing and different from other Japanese places. So that was fun. 

Overall, it's not bad, but if reviews rave about the freshness of the fish here, I'm not hopeful of finding better places until I visit Vancouver again. 

Oh, by the way - there were three chefs last night, and two of them were not Japanese - if that is something you care about."}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but I am a Googler.  I google people, places and things all the time.  I google restaurants I walk by and I was so happy to find this place.  Wow Sushi has great reviews and I can say firsthand they are well deserved.  The prices are not cheap, but for the quality and service, they are extremely reasonable. I'm from B.C where there are many sushi joints.  Tojo's in Vancouver and Sushi Sasabune in Honolulu are  my favourite sushi restaurants.    I'd say Wow sushi is comparable to Tojo's in quality and without the high price.  Sushi Sasabune has fish flown in from other parts of the world and extremely expensive so I won't even compare. 

 I've only done take out here but the service is superb.  They are very sweet, so sweet that they draw cartoons on the salad take out container lid. Makes my say. In conclusion, I love them.  They make some of the best sushi I've eaten affordable to eat  regularly."}
{"text":"great sushi, but the donburi bowlwas awful. The sashimi was very fresh and the size if nigiri was just right. However, the donburi was one of the worst ive tried. Definetly visit for sushi, but other menu items i wouldnt come here for"}
{"text":"After looking at the pictures and all the rave reviews, I decided on this venue to end my week long  bday celebration with my good friends.  We normally go to House of Gourmet in Chinatown but for this special occasion, they agreed to do something more upscale on my account.

So we made reservations for a party of 4.  Two of us arrived a bit late but they didn't seem to make any objections. Given that the table was too small for 4 people, they had to bring another small adjoining table.  Unfortunately for me, I sat at the cusp of where the tables adjoined but the two tables were not levelled. Though I am not a stickler for those types of details, I did find it a bit odd that I had to eat with my plate on a slant.

To begin, they brought us a small dish of edamame which was on the house.  As we perused the menu, one of us ordered the chirachi ($18), another the shashimi dinner ($22), another the sushi dinner ($22), and I, being high maintenance, decided to order a la carte.  My order consisted of the spider roll ($10), the hamachi sushi ($7), the butter fish ($5), and the uni - sea urchin ($7).  To start the meal, they brought us miso soup and an iceberg lettuce salad. These starters were included but they tasted of nothing special. We then ordered some fried chicken and another set of edamame as apertizers.  The fried chicken bits came with a mayo sauce, and again, there was nothing special about this dish, particularly the presentation. Literally some chicken bit scrapped laid out on a plate with a wedge of lemon.  The edamame came steaming hot and were quite good, albeit in a small soup bowl.

Our meals came all at once except for my a la carte sushi.  I had asked if there were any specials of the day and they simply stated there was hamachi and sea bass.  The shashimi dinner came with 4 types of fish (4 slices of each - salmon, tuna, and two types of white fish), rice, and a raw shrimp in a martini glass.  The Chirachi came in a bowl and had fish similar to the sashimi.  The sushi dinner had the most bang for the buck with 14 pieces of sushi (salmon, tuna, butterfish, hamachi, and a few other types of fish I did not recognize) and an 8 piece dynamite roll. My own meal was a 8 piece spider roll and 6 pieces of a la carte sushi. 

After seeing the photos online, I wasn't exactly blown away by the presentation of my a la carte sushi, nor too impressed with the plating of the other dishes.  The spider roll - which is the item that i use to measure japanese restaurants fell below my expectations.  They used imitation crab as a side filler and I could hardly taste the soft shell crab which was there - i could see it, but I could not taste it!  The combination of ingredients in the roll took away from the authentic taste of the crab.  As for the sushi, my hamachi had a jalapeno taste to it, my butterfish had some sweet brown rub on it, and my uni, though was fresh looked liked someone had squeezed it with their fist using all their might.  However that being said, the quality of the food was top notch - everything was  fresh.  To measure freshness, I usually sample the uni.  At the end of the meal, we were given a Japango roll on the house. It was a blend of imitation crab with cucumber/puree avocado, wrapped with cooked salmon and a piece of scallop on top. The whole thing was topped with a sweet teriaki sauce.  It also had a mild taste of grilled sea weed.  

The evening was completed with a complimentary ice cream. We ordered green tea and sesame. The sesame ice cream was good, although it was a little too soft as it melted very quickly.

The meal only came to $101 before tip which was very reasonable.  

The only strange thing is that they don't automatically bring tea. I think that it sort of takes away from the \"Japanese\" experience.  

We all commented that the food here was similar in style to Sushi Couture on Bloor street but with heftier prices. 

I personally am not a fan of the food that I had. I prefer sushi that is enhanced in flavor not covered up with sauces and concoctions. Good sushi generally can stand on its own and sauces should be there to enhance the authentic flavor of the food. Also, I couldn't understand why not more effort went into the plating, especially my scrunched up Uni drizzled with thinly sliced seaweed. It was much effort to attempt to put in my mouth what looked like a piece of sushi that had been run over by a bike and carefully put back on the plate. My spider roll came with dizzles of teriaki sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds which was underwhelming.

Many here may not agree with my opinion given that their experience seems to have been alot more positive.  I have had sushi in Montreal Vancouver, Hong Kong, New York, and Chicago. If you want sushi that will blow your mind, try Japonais in Chicago.  That is what I consider pricey but very well executed and plated. Everything was flavored and grilled to perfection not to mention an excellent ambianc"}
{"text":"Pleasant but smaller seating. Ordered the Charashi dinner. It was $18 before tax and tip. It was very small portion but very fancy. I was contemplating between this and ayce and I think I would have been better off ordering ayce two blocks down."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  The food is incredibly high quality, and the service is very good.  We ordered quite a lot and spent less than $30 each.  Just great."}
{"text":"Visited at around 6pm on a Wednesday.  As expected it was not too busy and there was only 1 other table at the time.  Ordered the small sushi boat and a dragon roll.  Sushi was quite fresh and rolls were well done.  Overall a good sushi meal in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Came here and tried several rolls including the Japan Go roll, and the Global leslie roll.

This is a nice sushi place, serving fresh ingredients. 

The restaurant is not very big

Servers are nice and attentive

Would return again"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great maki (use very little rice)! Sashimi is fresh. $$"}
{"text":"Got a groupon and decided to try it out based on the location and reviews. We were not disappointed on the quality of the food but even with our discount, the bill turned out to be much more than we anticipated. 
The place is small but staff is quite attentive. The Japango is definitely my favorite roll. I found there was a bit too much rice per roll. I really like the fact that we can have brown rice ($1 more per roll) as not many sushi places offer this option.
I definitely liked it but it won't become my favorite go-to sushi place due to the price... I wish they offered AYCE :)"}
{"text":"With such high rating on Yelp I am quite shocked and disappointed after visiting this restaurant.  As soon as you sit down they provided water, miso soup and salad.  The place was small and I was quickly seated.  Ordered the sushi dinner; the plate came in within 5 mins now I know everything was pre prepped.  The waitress slammed the plate down without informing me what any of the sushis are.  The fish and the torch method were all mediocre at best; at the end all of them tasted the same.  When it came to the bill the waitress practically threw the receipt at me.  Needless to say I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Just an Okay sushi restaurant. We went there for lunch on a Saturday, only a few tables occupied. Not busy at all. Food, I would say just average, or a little small in portion, the miso soup too salty. Say if I would make an effort to go back, probably not."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon, table for 2, lots of space almost nobody was left past 1:30, so if you can come for a later lunch def do that.  yes the salmon and butterfish sashimis are all good, the japango roll is delicious (more on the sweet side), but that's about it, the rest is pretty average. 
with that said the service is good and the prompt tea salad and soup are nice."}
{"text":"There are only a few Japanese restaurants that offer great quality Nigiri Sushi in Toronto and this place is one of them. I enjoy coming here as the place is easy to access by TTC, and the food is affordable compare to other authentic Japanese restaurants in downtown. Their rolls are pretty good, but I personally recommend their Nigiri & Chirashi sushi the most. One down side about the place is that it is quite small and you need to be prepared for a long wait time if you get here during regular lunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"Two brothers who own place are always smiling and happy to serve! Best sushi in the city, reasonably priced, great service, only place I get sushi from. I'd say we have eaten here at least once a week for the last year and a half and have never been disappointed. They also catered my Super Bowl party"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 people for my birthday. I ordered the moriawase. My friends were served first and I figured my order was just taking a while so I waited. When everyone was almost finished eating and I still didn't receive my order, I asked the waitress. She turned to the chef and asked him why he hasn't made the order yet (it wasn't lost and she was pointing at it). He just shook his head and didn't say anything. She asked me if I wanted him to make it now but everyone was almost done eating so I said no. She gave me a half hearted \"sorry\" and walked away. My friend felt bad for me and asked if they can comp anything, she said they can give me an icecream. They gave us our bill and by the time everyone finished paying (which took about 15 minutes), they still didn't come back with any icecream so we just left. Absolutely disappointed in the service and how they handled forgetting my order."}
{"text":"Quick update
- I don't frequent this place as much as I wish to but the food is still amazing and had great service ; very helpful choosing something new for my picky wife"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and family, decent service, awful prices and the food is just OK. Definitely feel incredibly shorted on the appetizers, will not return but if you're in the area and want this kind of food meh, expect to drop $$$ to feel full."}
{"text":"Hands down my fave sushi joint in Toronto!  Fresh, delicious and worth every penny. The crispy garlic topper on the sushi is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! Sushi, when they opened my thoughts were \"what does Toronto need another sushi restaurant for?\". So despite living practically next door, it took me several months before even trying this place, and man I have to say, I didn't know what I was missing...

When entering you are usually greeted by the two brothers owning this place in a very enthusiastic manner, making you feel welcome right from the start. The service is great and polite - most times I've been here the owner will come to your table afterwards to ask if everything was to your liking.

Now for the food - there are probably no wrong choices on the menu, but after eating here on multiple occasions my advise is: take the sushi boat (a medium one will feed two people with an appetite). Nothing beats being surprised by whatever the chef feels like making combined with what's fresh in store. Talking about fresh - it is fresh for sure, with fish flown in from Japan on a weekly basis.

Will definitely come here more often!"}
{"text":"I came here with an old coworker at around 5pm.  I made a reservation just in case but we were the only two people there. What surprised me the most was how rudely the waitress rushed us through our meal. Another pair came in at some point but left fairly quickly. Other than that we basically had the whole place to ourselves and I still didn't understand why we had to be rushed out. She kept looking over and after dropping off the cheque (without us asking) she later brought over the debit/credit machine forcing us to pay (that was rude). After we finished our meal she could have asked if we wanted anything else because I probably would have gotten something knowing we needed time to catch up. I won't be coming back because of this. The food was fine but the poor service ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Came there alone. They have a seat behind the door which is really private, I like it.
Ordered uni and japango roll.
I don't like uni. It really makes sick.
The japango roll is pretty good. Proper size."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Small space, only a few tables, but the sushi is cut the way it usually is in Japan -- small, thin slices. Everything I ate was great, including the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Best I've had in toronto thus far. I've eaten once in the restaurant and also got takeout. Takeout was good quality, the same as you get in the restaurant (only thing is that the tempura gets a bit soggy since there is condensation in the container because it is hot), but overall I love this place!"}
{"text":"Been here several times with various friends and it's usually a winner in terms of the food; mixed in terms of service. Nice variety of fish and presentation. Good fish to rice ratio for nigiri and maki. Probably the best sushi place in the area. There is limited seating, so try and go when it's not a busy time, or just before the lunch and dinner rushes. The restaurant is clean and decently presented. Service ranges from very good to downright unfriendly. The last time I was there, we were served by a waitress that appeared to find that all customers bothered her. The sushi chefs are nice though.

Note, if you are vegetarian, this is *not* the place for you. Extremely limited options and you'll go away disappointed. The miso soup isn't vegetarian either (it usually isn't anywhere actually)."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty sushi. Friendly staff, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Totally disappointed with the sashimi lunch. I have never seen such small pieces of sashimi before. The food was fresh but sashimi was so small it looks like they cut it in half to make it to match the number of pieces they stated on the menu. I was totally wow!!! They really matched up their name in a negative way."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Salmon roll along with Philadelphia roll. It was definitely better than most of the AYCE sushis I have had around this area!"}
{"text":"Tried the Japango roll. It was nice but for some reason I was expecting the topped salmon to be raw but it was cooked.  I would have preferred raw with a bit of sauce.  

The people are very nice and friendly.  Miso soup was not good and not upto the par."}
{"text":"When i walked in, i was a little specticle on what am i going get into .. but the waitress was very nice and welcoming.. even the chef was welcoming :) .. I ordered the Sushi Lunch, and i gotto tell you .. its just blew me off, So delicious, so so very tasty!!  .. 5 stars! .. i will go again for sure! .. this one just made it to my favourite list of restaurants."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that Wow! Sushi is the best sushi in Toronto, but I would definitely say that it's the best I've had in the area so far. Every time I go to Wow! Sushi, eating the sashimi platter reminds me of my trip to Tokyo last summer. This place is a bit larger than Japango (seats about 20) and is located in a quiet corner off of Yonge Street. The different cuts of fish they offer all seem to just melt one by one in your mouth, and if you're not a fan of sashimi, they also have delicious rolls! For a simple roll that contains different types of fish, I would definitely recommend the rainbow roll, which is a basic California roll topped with 4 different types of sashimi."}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading a lot of positive reviews about it here on Yelp. It was true. Their fish IS really fresh! It's worth a try. I had the salmon sashimi and spicy salmon roll and my friend (who had been here before and raved about it) had a buttery fish that I don't remember the name of, but it was super delish!
It's a bit on the pricier side, the portions are the tiniest I've even seen! And the sashimi comes on top of shredded radish instead of a bed of rice. The rolls were yummy, a bit on the untidy side though and were really miniscule. It's a bad idea to go there starving as you might have to order loads (they serve bit-size portions; they look more like tapas than meals) but if you're going for a light dinner or craving some uber fresh fish, it's THE place!"}
{"text":"So excited to have this restaurant just outside my front door. Food is fresh and so good. The seating is minimal but the atmosphere and the service is 5 star. Price fits anyone's budget. Highly recommend. Markham has a new little gem to its crown."}
{"text":"Chirashi lunch today?
there was lots of shredded cabbage in the dish.
no tako, ika, kani, et al....
well, i'm not going therre again."}
{"text":"Sushi lunch and Chirashi lunch are my go to items. Personally I think it's a bit pricey for lunch ($13 and $14), but the food is really good. The sushi rice is right to my taste and i like both the texture and flavour (I think the rice tastes sweeter than other sushi places). The fish is fresh and Chirashi lunch offers enough fish varieties to calm my sashimi cravings. This is the place I always visit when I am disappointed at the sushi experiences with other places."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here. The sushi had too much rice and the fish didn't taste very fresh. Everything was underwhelming"}
{"text":"I was on my way home thinking what quick lunch can I grab to go? Yelp found me Wow! Sushi just down the street.

Quite a small store but it was nice and clean. The owners were extremely friendly from the second I stepped in. One pulled out a chair for me at the bar and brought me a cup of tea right away. And something I really appreciated was the guy saying \"excellent choice!\" when I ordered the Chirashi sushi. It's so simple yet I find most servers forget that a small confirmatory statement can go a long way.

As soon as I ordered the Chirashi, I started mulling over my choice in my head. I was worried about the quality and experience of the meal once it touched a hideous styrofoam box. To my huge surprise, I got home to find a beautifully presented Chirashi sushi in a plastic take-away box! They really were ahead of me there. Huge ups.

The choice of sushi samples were great with even a few seared pieces. I must point out the sashimi cuts were small and the overall portion was adequate for lunch, def not enough for dinner. I wonder, though, will they upkeep their impressive presentations when they become swamped during a meal time? And if that declines, how much will my overall enjoyment decline?

Anyway, I'd definitely give it another go at Wow Sushi - sitting in this time. Just to clarify though, take it as an Asian lesson... the owners are NOT Japanese - they are two experienced Chinese sushi chefs. All my authentic sushi shit aside, I approve of what they are starting right hurr.

{"text":"I had lunch here today, and it was just sublime. Attentive and friendly staff, on-the-house appetizers, and beautiful presentation.  I had the Luis roll, which was shrimp tempura maki with a spicy salmon mixture on top, capped  with a sprinkling of roe. I lucked out, and was given organic salmon at no extra charge! My friend had the first roll on the maki list (whose name I cant recall), but it had seared scallops on top and bits of 24 karat gold (over the top? Yes. Do I care? No.)

I just may have to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi bar I have had; even worst than ayce sushi.  It's a nice quiet joint, a perfect location for sushi since there are very few in that area.  Ordered a sushi roll and I swear it tasted like left overs... from the week before.  The table that walked in afterwards were not pleased either and they were very outspoken about it.

Quality: 1/5
Value: 1/5
Service: 3/5 (waitress was polite)
Freshness: -5/5

Won't go back even if it's free.  I had high hope from the great reviews too.  Thanks a lot Yelpers!  Keep writing those bogus reviews!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place for sushi. Will definitely come back for more! Sushi was nice and fresh and my boyfriend (who spent a year in japan and is a sushi snob) said he enjoyed his food. Server noticed that I was ordering all vegetarian sushi and sent some fried tofu to our table on the house! Can definitely stand behind the \"yelpers love us\" stickers that are posted in the windows."}
{"text":"Had a delightful lunch today. Great service, tasty sushi and a delicious experience overall for a reasonable price. Would visit here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Rarely do we find such a cozy and delicious sushi spot downtown- this one is definitely one I would recommend to others and frequent myself from now on. We went on a wed night around 8pm and the restaurant was maybe only half full. One great thing about this spot is there's an obscure area in directly in front of the resto that has free parking ( theres maybe only room for 4-5 cars) which is a definite bonus especially considering that its in the core of the city. 

Decor/staff/overall ambience:

It's not the prettiest sushi joint I've been to but it's quaint and quiet- good for a nice casual date with some good conversation. The waitresses were very Attentive- constant refilling of tea and even gave my bf and I extra candies at the end when they noticed us bickering over the flavours! 
 
Food: 
we ordered the small sushi/rolls combination dinner for 45$-20 pcs. Soup and salad were brought out even before we ordered so it was nice to get the belly warmed up. Salad dressing was perfect amount of sweetness and tartness and was just enough to coat the veg evenly. As for our main course, we were expecting to get a giant plate with all the rolls/sushi together (like how most resto's do it) but they actually presented everything separate in 3 dishes- a nice touch because you get a sense that they weren't rushing you and really wanted you to focus on each dish. The first plate we got were the nigiri sushi. The fish was unbelievably fresh and some of them we couldn't even identify because we had never had them before! The fish were all at a good room temperature ( which I believe is how authentic sushi should be) and some were garnished with ginger or dried garlic--a nice touch of detail and enhanced the flavor of the fish. Our second dish was a nice spicy tuna w/ tempura shrimp roll-presentation was gorgeous and the spicy sauce actually had a nice 'kick' to it contrary to most other joints and what we call their 'coloured mayo'. The last 2 rolls were great as well, a plainer spicy tuna roll and salmon roll. By then my bf and I were stuffed and I was glad they brought out the better stuff first! 

Overall, I was very impressed-its hard to find a good authentic sushi joint downtown so this will be one of my go-to spots from now on!"}
{"text":"The place got busy fast. The service was not good at all. My friend asked for hot sauce and when she asked for another the waitress gave her a cut eye. The food was very delicious. The atmosphere was nice too. The guys behind the sushi bar was very friendly and greeted us and said bye."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend yesterday cause I absolutely couldn't take it when she kept referring this place as the best sushi place in Toronto and think I should give it a try and prove her wrong. 

And Turns out I was wrong, this place is the best sushi place among all the sushi restaurants I tried in Toronto. I got the sushi dinner, 12 pieces of sushi and about 10 pieces of maki, the taste was amazing (especially the lightly toasted tuna and white tuna), and the presentation was flawless. Every bite was a small explosion of amazingness in my head (is it too much?). 

The owner came later and asked us how we felt about the food, so another shining star for the service. I know this place is kinda like Japango, but the price is similar, and Wowsushi is a lot more comfortable and easier to get a table, so I recommend Wow sushi. 

They got full around 6:30 or so yesterday, so maybe go a bit earlier if you don't want to wait for a table. and btw, if you can go there on a weekly basis for two months, you can ask for your personal chopsticks."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Toronto!. Don't bother trying anywhere else because you will be disappointed. The tuna carpaccio is to die for! Just go!!!!"}
{"text":"Legit and fresh sushi/sashimi sets.
Japango Roll was also pretty good.
But most of their cooked foods I have tried so far were below or just average (yaki udon, katsu don, tonkatsu...)

Service was always friendly and fast.

Bottom line: come here for raw foods. Dont order cooked ones."}
{"text":"This restaurant  was over rated, the price of the food was$$$$ and the quality is $. Not coming here again!!! (thumbs down) grumpy face"}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly! He some times gives us free ice cream and agedashi tofu with our meals. My hubby and I usually get the \"small boat\" to share and it is excellent. The sushi served with the boat is not always the same, so that is nice, the chef gives you what is in season. Other items on the menu such as the eggplant are all very good and fresh."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place ever since it opened last summer. Good price for the quality  you get - not a lot of rice on the rolls and good quality fish (something I find hard to find in Toronto compared to Vancouver). Love the Japango roll, the spicy scallop hand roll, as well as the Chirashi. 

The owners are very friendly. I've gotten free appetizers, rolls, and dessert before. I'm never disappointed when I eat here."}
{"text":"Gross and deep fried. Some items were standard at best. The chicken skewer was shocking (see photo)."}
{"text":"Sub Par Food. Terrible Service.

The food has been slipping in quality steadily for well over a year -- to a point that it's on par with super market take-out.

The service has also become deplorable. The last time we had a problem with our order and called to complain, they insisted on playing stupid in both English and French to avoid addressing the problem.

Don't bother eating or ordering from here."}
{"text":"There is a plethora of sushi options in downtown, but among those, perhaps only a handful of the mid-range sushi joints are worthy of return visits. 

This week, I've added Wow! Sushi to that little list. Do not be swayed by the odd name choice - this small, authentic, Japanese-run restaurant delivers delicious makimono rolls and sashimi plates without breaking the bank. 

My dining partner and I opted to share a sashimi dinner, a black cod appetizer, and a couple of rolls. The sashimi selection was top-notch and fresh. The black cod, while a bit on the salty side, certainly gave Guu's black cod a run for its money. The rolls were well made and light on the rice, which is always welcome, especially towards the end of a meal.

Some more points:
- They gave both of us salad and miso even though, technically, we only ordered one dinner. 
- Presentation of all the dishes were incredible.
- Great value for lunch! Will definitely be back to try it.
- Friendly and attentive service"}
{"text":"This hidden gem has some of the best sushi around. Just make sure you get a reservation this place is tiny and is filled fast!"}
{"text":"Recommend dishes: Salmon Teriyaki, Sashimi.

I usually go for their rolls or Sashimi,  not till I tried their teriyaki salmon and chicken, thumbs up, so tasteful, i ordered the takeout, they even draw smily faces on the takeout box. The best part is they separated the salad source and the salad, and they separated the teriyaki meat and rice, I love the sesame on top of my rice, for a picky perso like me, this rocks. However, it will be better if they increase the quantity of the rice and soup a bit. I am a girl with small stomach, and this is the first time I think i will need more rice!"}
{"text":"Went here to try something else in the neighbourhood that was recommended. I regret my choice. 

Poor customer service. I shouldn't have to ask for my order to be taken. Or my water to be filled. Or my bill to be given. Or the machine to pay with... These things should be anticipated if not expected. Also, servers should not be hanging out and talking or looking at phones on the side while I'm waiting to order or wanting basic service. 

Ordered Chirashi and tempura. Chirashi should be served very simple and it wasn't. Extra spices and dressings around the sashimi just get in the way. The fish was not the best quality and the amount of fish I received was inadequately thin. The tempura tasted greasy and odd... Possibly bad or old oil, or an unclean cooker. 

Not worth the rating it is given. I will go elsewhere and not recommend."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times after a recommendation came from a friend of mine that goes there all the time and I have to say that I was really surprised with the quality of the fish and selection.
It's a small place cute and cozy, you will like it."}
{"text":"Wow service. 

Not talking about dining in, been there for dinner before. Was great.  From what I recall the rolls, prepared with care and not too much rice - perfect, the sashimi was fresh melt in your mouth.. oh and exotic too I remember the waitress saying for the sashimi we had was fish flown in from Greece. 

But let me tell you what happened on New Years Eve. Tamara and I came down with a cold quite suddenly and unfortunately we had to cancel our plans with friends that night. Bummer. :(  We made the best of things and decided to throw our own little party at the condo.

A call to Wow was in order!

So at around 6pm we started to feel hungry. We jumped on the Just-Eats.ca website to order our sushi but we were saddened to see that we were just outside the delivery zone for Wow. :(  Even chatted with Just-Eat.ca customer service to clarify..

Oh well so much for the Internet order, so we called Wow directly to place the order.  Wow took our sushi roll order over the phone. 

5 minutes later though they called back and said they were pretty busy on NYE. They suggested delivery would be faster if we were to call so,so company? (don't recall the name) for the order. We did end up calling the other delivery company they suggested but they were closed New Years Eve. 

We called Wow back, pleaded with them, complimented them, mentioned to them we enjoyed dining there before..   they were so nice, maybe took pity on us or perhaps tickled pink by our compliments and said ok they'd do it. They took our order.  We were soo happy! 

About 40 min later, we get a call from a delivery guy, kind of frantic sounding, wondering where we were?  He had some trouble locating the condo it seems. 

After clarifying over the phone the location,  a knock on the door was heard and  lo and behold.. it was one of the Wow Sushi Chefs in person!   delivering the order to the door.  Amazing!.  He said he threw in an extra roll and drink too.  Needless to say he got a good tip. 

Well that's the story of Wow service we received that night. They went beyond what's typical to ensure we were happy.

btw, the food we ordered for takeout was superb, the same quality as we found from dining in. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"I did the omakase ($35 or 40, I forget). I got about 10 pieces of sashimi, 6 or so nigiri, and a california roll. The fish was fresh, the torched white fish (mackerel I think) was well executed, the tako was perfect, and the fish overall was very fresh. The california roll was a throwaway and the rolls I tried from my dining companions were fairly common. I was surprised there was no tamago based on the rest of the offerings. As an omakase, for the price point, it was probably above average.

I found the service to be fine. The space is tiny. I'd go frequently if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today with a friend, was not disappointed.

We arrived a little before noon on a Wednesday and the tables hadn't filled up yet so we were seated immediately. This place is VERY small though so in the future I will definitely know to either come early or make a reservation (especially for dinner).

Service was quick and friendly. We were promptly served hot tea as well as our miso soup and salad as soon as we sat down.

Both my friend and I were craving sashimi so we both ordered the sashimi lunch ($15 each) which was delicious. Each came with 14 pcs of assorted fish, all very tasty and fresh. My friend and I were both impressed that even uni (sea urchin) was part of the assortment - something you don't see too often in other Japanese restaurants. Every piece of fish was very flavorful, and though I will always love my salmon sashimi, the salmon was actually overshadowed by how outstanding the other pieces of fish were.

Glad to have found a spot downtown with fresh and delicious sashimi!"}
{"text":"If I want a la carte sushi, then Wow! is definitely the place I head to. 

The place is really small but I've never had to wait. Within 2 minutes of sitting down, the waiter or waitress brings over miso soup and salad on the house. Most places charge around $1.50 - $2 for each of these dishes so having complimentary appetizers is always nice. 

I've gone here on many occasion and I enjoy the maki dinner or sushi dinner or just ordering a la carte sushi. The food is delicious but sushi is on the smaller side. No complaints at all about the food. Be sure to ask the waiter how many rolls you get if you don't want to waste food because once I ordered a maki lunch and got double the rolls I expected for the price listed on the menu (ended up taking it home to eat).

The best part about the restaurant is the service. It's exceptional. The waiters never say \"you're welcome\" but are always thanking you. On numerous occasions, I've gotten free hand rolls on the house. Another time, one waitress bumped into our table and a bit of miso soup spilled on my friend and they gave us not only a free roll, but took another dish off our bill and gave us a discount. 

I highly recommend this restaurant. I've also introduced a few people to this place and returned to me with compliments."}
{"text":"We came here close to 9pm on a very cold night and were quickly greeted with free tea and miso soup! The staff was very nice. We ordered an eel roll and 3 of their special rolls. All were great. What I like about their rolls is they don't use rice as a filler or to make the portions look larger. The quality and freshness of their rolls were excellent. We also had their fried tempura platter that had shrimp, mushrooms, yam, and other various vegetables from their appetizer portion of the menu and it was very large. By the end of the meal we were full and more then content. To our surprise, we got a free scoop of both the green tea icecream and the sesame seed icecream. The green tea icecream is the same everywhere but the sesame seed icecream was quite unique and surprisingly good. We were also given small candies as we parted. I normally don't pay much attention to service, as long as the food can speak for itself but WOW Sushi's service has to be commended for their attentiveness and hospitality! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Toronto, Canada area."}
{"text":"I had to write a review on how awesome the service is at 'Wow Sushi.' I discovered this place a couple of weeks ago. I work in close vicinity of this tiny restaurant and am a regular customer of 'Sushi Inn.' However since my last visit there was so horrible that me and my friends decided to find a new joint! So about 2 weeks ago we went to Wow and were really 'wowed' (sorry for the cheesiness). Unfortunately I can't munch on much sushi as I'm pregnant, but what I ordered and the service and complimentary items they brought us was fantastic! Been back a second time since and they remembered us! I can't wait to have my baby so I can go and treat myself to the amazing sushi they seem to have on the menu.

Note: I gave 5 stars mainly for the service if I had to rate the food I'd give it a 4. The only thing I didn't like was my dynamite roll was warm due to the spicy warm? Sauce on the plate!? I don't like my sushi to feel heated!"}
{"text":"Despite its name, Wow! Sushi is an unassuming sushi restaurant on Charles Street.  At first glance, it appears to be one of the many run-of-the-mill sushi joints downtown.  Instead, it is a hidden gem!

I was very impressed with their version of chirashi, which traditionally is a dish consisting of assorted pieces of raw fish served over a bed of sushi rice.  You pay a little more for a chirashi here than your average sushi place but it's well worth it.  At an average sushi joint, the ever ubiquitous salmon makes up the majority of the dish with other routine pieces such as tuna, surf clam and shrimp.  How boring!  But, at Wow, you can delight your palate with a better selection of fish that involves sea bream, mackerel, and B.C. tuna.  Not only do you get variety, but you also get freshness and flavour.  Such is the case with their butterfish, where you can taste all the subtle nuances of the fish.  At your dime a dozen sushi place, you tend to get served inferior butterfish pieces that have poor texture and taste.  Often this happens because the fish has excess water from being partially thawed from being frozen, but Wow gets it right.

Wow! Sushi is a great option to satisfy your sushi fix for instances when you want better quality fish without breaking the bank with the likes of JaBistro, Japango, Kaji, or Yasu."}
{"text":"Finally! Wow sushi comes to Markham and it's just as amazing as it's downtown location (which we were regulars of before moving to Markham). 

We visited the week it opened. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The sushi guys greet you as you walk in which is nice. The owners and menu are the same as the downtown location. 

We were given an appetizer on the house as a promo for their opening. It was their tofu dish (can't remember the name). It was tasty! 

We then shared the sashimi lunch, sushi lunch and 2 maki set. It was definitely enough for 2 ppl. It came with miso soup and salad. I love the salad at this place because the dressing is a vinaigrette opposed to other Japanese restaurants that often give some kind of creamy thousand Island dressing. 

The fish at this place is fresh. Really. Every piece tasted so nice!  The lunch specials came with a nice variety of fish so you can try different items. 

We also really like the spicy mayo here. They use some kind of chili oil to make the mayo which is so tasty. I always ask for some on the side. 

Can't wait to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I've ordered food from Wow Sushi many times in the past and have always enjoyed the taste and quality of their sushi. However, in the last few months, I've noticed a gradual decline in the taste and quality. 

I had a sushi craving one night and decided to give them another try. My order took a total of 2 hours and 17 minutes to arrive (I live no more than a kilometre away). No apology, no explanation, no nothing. Sushi portions have gotten SO MUCH smaller (about the size of a thumb!). The rice was bland, and was so warm that it cooked the sushi! I even found a piece of plastic in my food. I never really used to mind paying for their expensive sushi, because the quality (in the past) justified it. For the amount of money that I paid this time, it was a TOTAL RIP OFF. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Medium party tray which currently is 25% off at $49.99. Pleasantly surprised when I saw 4 pieces of uni sushi as a part of the tray! The way some of the rolls are made didn't look too great (some fell apart) but they did taste quite delicious. If the tray was regular price I honestly don't think it would have been worth it. They don't seem to offer sashimi with their party trays.  Quality wise this place is pretty comparable to Osaka also in Markham but in my opinion Osaka is slightly better. The lunch specials seem like a better deal."}
{"text":"I was so exiciting to discover japanese sushi in Toronto this afternoon, but Wow sushi has destroyed all of my feeling. 

Service is bad, server dont even know names of the food items and rude when they giving spoon to customer.

Food quality is below average (in my opinion). I hate the way they roll the sushi, not tight, and small . Look like that's the way they make money. (I dont even want to take photos of the food).

Price is totally not match with the food quality received in return.

Basically, I think customer can pay higher for better food, not for this kind of quality, especially for sushi."}
{"text":"Food quality degraded since last year. This is a Chinese owned Japanese restaurant and you can tell ... The sushi chefs are loud and trying to make their Chinese accents sound Japanese. They mutter under their breath after they welcome you in. The waitresses are a bit clueless and the sushi is not fresh- actually chewy... The miso soup was too salty and the fried chicken is likely one chicken thigh cut up into tiny pieces and fried up... And I actually suspect it isn't even chicken. 
I will not be coming back ever. It took a lot of dessert to get rid of the after taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi doesn't look much from outside, i am sure i wouldn't have walked in if I havent read the reviews. I am however very happy i tried it as it did not disappoint. I loved the food, very well done, the pieces are the right size and the taste... hmmmmmm so good. i will most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the good reviews. We went on a Sunday for lunch -- it was fairly quiet, but this place was not very big anyway. The servers were friendly and welcoming. 

We ordered the Spicy Tuna maki, Spicy Salmon maki and Philadelphia roll. The fish tasted really fresh, it just melt in your mouth. There was a bit too much cream cheese in the Philadelphia roll, but overall everything was delicious. 

This place is pretty good, one of the better sushi places in the downtown core."}
{"text":"quality sushi with decent pricing! definitely should be on top of the list for good sushi places in Toronto"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!

The sushi and sashimi is always fresh and the quality of food is always consistent. 

My go to menu item is the sushi lunch. For $12 you will get 8 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of maki (most of which is the chef's choice but the sushi is usually salmon, tuna, white tuna, sea bream).

The restaurant uses a higher quality of rice which gives it a sticky texture and adds a bit of sweetness to the overall taste of the sushi. I'm a huge fan of this. I remember the first few times I came here I was so amazed that I asked the chef to give me the brand of the rice and I had to go to a Japanese supermarket in J-TOWN (Steeles Ave. and Woodbine) to find it.  

The sushi chef puts a lot of attention to detail and usually torches the white tuna and sea bream giving it extra flavour.

This is a small and cozy restaurant with less than 10 tables. If you have more than four people, I suggest making a reservation. 

This place is quite busy at lunch time during the week."}
{"text":"Customer service great, quality of food amazing, price reasonable.

I hadn't gone to this venue in years, but was in the area, so I decided to give it a go with a few friends.

We got there about an hour before they closed, and we were quickly seated. We were served green tea, followed by miso soup before even placing our orders. Then when placing our orders, we were served salad just as we were finishing our soups, and then the main course came as we were finishing our salads.

I ordered a chirashi dinner, which went for $18. I found the meal to be very fresh, the texture was amazing, and all-in-all, I was extremely happy with it. I wonder how it defers from the $14 chirashi lunch (perhaps it's of a larger size?). Anyhow, we were there during dinner time, so perhaps next time I'm in the area at around lunch time, I'll be able to compare.

The dishes were collected as we were done our meals. I did need to ask for soy sauce, when I noticed that none of the other tables had soy sauce on them either, but I didn't find that to be a big deal.

The bill was brought over to us and split up in pen on the receipt for each of our meals, and it arrived around 10 mins before they closed, which worked out well, as I had parked on one of the side-streets that required a permit to park there that coincided with the venue's closing time.

All-in-all, I'd say that both based on the quality of the food and the customer service, I'll be back to this venue again in the future."}
{"text":"No WOW moment for me- underwhelming at best! After reading rave reviews and being down the street from a sushi place I frequent, I had to try it!

Pros- 
Greeted instantly and lots of staff for such a small resto
Offered green tea even though I was ordering takeout
Food was ready in 5-8 minutes (arrived around 5pm on a weekday)
Brown rice on request- extra dollar for each maki roll. Considered butchery by some however health trumps after nearly a week of eating out. Order brown when offered on the menu.

Cons-
Small maki rolls- was aware based on the reviews however the actual maki ingredients used were sparse
Ordered 3 maki rolls had one small serving of wasabi

Spicy Salmon- no spicy mayo could be detected among the few traces of salmon- barely visible to the human eye

Yam Tempura with avocado- equal proportion of yam and avocado- sauce on top brought out the sweetness of the yam- great flavours

Dragon Maki (Gold/Salmon)- the roll was smaller than standard maki offered elsewhere. The top pieces of salmon and avocado only covered half of the maki roll. Inside a couple slivers of cucumber. Typically avocado is used in dragon rolls that I've tried in other sushi joints.

Overall, the size would be understandable if the actual ingredients used in the maki were of quality and substance. I felt like I was eating brown rice and seaweed and could not tell you if the salmon was fresh or not as there was hardly any in there.

Spending $30 after tax- a hefty price for the size and skimpiness of ingredients used.

I am hoping this was a bad chance encounter as some Yelpers have indicated lack of consistency."}
{"text":"The chefs are a rambunctious bunch of adorable goodness. They greet you loudly such that the snow falls right off your coat. The WOW! Sushi basically has WOW written on the plate with teriyaki sauce. So cute. Seating is super limited and maki & sushi is reasonably priced - around $8-$14 per maki roll. Presented beautifully every time."}
{"text":"Wow, your sashimi is so fresh. 

Seated beside the chef's station, we could see both of them working away as if they were running an AYCE sushi place. There was a line outside the door, so they were working like madmen. I'm gonna pat myself on the back for making reservations! 

What we ordered:
1. Sashimi Dinner [18 pcs assorted] - $26 (see picture) Beautifully presented & consists of sashimi assortments I don't usually see at other establishments (ie. two pieces of uni (sea urchin) and some other fish that I don't know the name of but melts in your mouth)

2. Sushi Dinner [12 pcs sushi & 8 pcs roll] - $22 They should take out the rolls in this dish because it really is just rice wrapped around shrimp tempura drizzled in sweet soy sauce. The sushi pieces, however, I loved! There was a bit too much rice for the size of sashimi on top, so you'll be full for sure!

3. Scallop (hatate gai) Sashimi [4 pcs] - $9 This dish was the only thing that was 'Meh'. For the price, I was hoping for something better than four thinly sliced pieces of scallop. It was like the chef used one scallop and sliced it into four pieces. 

4. Japan Go Maki - $10 [8 pcs] Amazing. You must order this if you come. Every ingredient used for this roll mashes together so well. You won't be disappointed. 

5. Black Sesame Ice Cream - $3 It tasted like the sesame seeds were freshly grounded, and the ice cream was at the right temperature. No freezer burn here!

I would have given them a five-star if the chef wasn't yelling in my ear the whole time at the poor waitresses running around. I understand he's trying to run his restaurant efficiently, but next time I hope I don't sit next to him (It's gotta be pretty scary to work there). But, I'll be back because I'm convinced they have a secret underground pond with live fish."}
{"text":"Tiny, tiny place with really old-fashioned decor, but I think that just adds to its charm! Without the help of Yelp I would never have found this restaurant - in fact even WITH the help of Yelp and Google Maps I somehow managed to walk right past it while on route. The interior, though, while slightly cramped, was quite cozy, clean, and not super crowded (on a Friday night) which gave it a very relaxed, intimate ambience. 

Given that this location is near Bloor and Yonge (a rather expensive area overall), I was not expecting the quantity and quality of food received. The sashimi don was exceedingly well portioned, with a wonderful variety of fish (super fresh!) that just mixed so perfectly with the warm rice and hot sauce. The size of the pot containing the udon was huge - and we were quite surprised at the plate of tempura which arrived shortly after as well. Taste? Delicious. I would say that the flavours and presentation are not subpar to many of the fancier Japanese restaurants downtown. For this filling dinner the prices are certainly reasonable, and if you are eating during lunch even more so.

In my personal experience, I thought service was absolutely excellent. I was served miso soup and tea AS SOON AS I sat down (before my companion arriving or even opening the menu)! It was a cold day outside so this was much appreciated. The waitress was friendly, efficient, and patient. My friend who was vegetarian made several modifications to her order and was readily accommodated each time. Food arrived promptly, tea cups were refilled, empty dishes were taken away; the staff was attentive but not intrusively so. In fact I didn't have to put up my hand or call for someone a single time throughout the entire night, from the ordering all the way to getting the bill. Neither were we ever rushed! I also saw another customer - likely a regular - come in for takeout and being greeted enthusiastically by the chefs. Upon our own exit a chorus of \"Thank you's\" and \"Good night's\" were heard - definitely a great end to the meal.

Wow Sushi, you have wowed me! I will grudgingly admit that you have lived up to your somewhat cringey name :)"}
{"text":"My SO and I decided to check out Wow! Sushi last night for quick dinner.  I was a bit taken back as to how small the place is; max 25 patrons if it were full.  When we arrived, we were seated immediately and served green tea.  The service was great the whole night.  Prices were reasonable considering there are like 5 sushi places all kitty corner from each other in the area.  

We ordered a variety of maki rolls; they were tastey BUT really on my small side.  After ordering 5 rolls, our bellies should have been full but sadly our bellies were not. The unagi rolls had limited unagi and their spicy salmon had a nice kick to it.

If you are looking for quick service, check out Wow! Sushi but you might need to get dessert elsewhere to have a full meal."}
{"text":"After a Costco run we wanted something other than the Costco hotdog and decided to give this place a shot. Great lunch menu with great prices. Definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Been here two times and was really disappointed the most recent occasion, to the point where I wonder if there's been a change in management.  The food was average but with some notable 'misses'.  For example, the sashimi came ice cold which didn't let the flavour come through.  But, the real problem was the service.  They seem to want you to get in and out as fast as possible.  They asked me if I wanted to order when half our table of four people was in the washroom.  They kept removing our plates even after we told them we were still working on the food.  They were busy towards the end of our meal but, really, I don't think you're doing your customers a service when you try to move them out before they are done.  Now, I am done and won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi I've ever eaten. Had sushi and sashimi special. Smallest sushi pieces. Sashimi inedible. Even cucumber and lime looked like they have been sitting out for a while. Spider roll was sweet and tiny. Pork katsu was at best average. And vegetables stale and appeared a few hours old. I followed Yelp reviews to check this place out. Don't know how this place could get 5 stars. One of the worst sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"I got the sashimi lunch for $15 at Wow Sushi and the sushi was really fresh and the presentation was really nice. Also ordered a spicy tuna roll, and it was good too. It was a bit different from the typical hot sauce on raw fish incarnation that comes from cheaper/AYCE sushi restaurants.

I went at 1pm on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. Accordingly, the service was really quick and attentive.

Great lunch place, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!  (Sorry couldn't help myself).  My hunt for EXCELLENT sushi since Lan Sushi closed down is over.  This is actually much better than Lan was as the fish is extremely fresh and they do little twists on the fish to make it taste better - not sure what they added but it was amazing.  Very accommodating of my salmon allergy as well.  Service was pleasant and friendly - not too many tables so make a reservation if you can.  Great date place :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and thought it was so-so.  We had uni sushi and uni shots, but the uni was a bit on the brown side and didn't taste like much of anything.  The sashimi platter was alright; the food was overall pretty much what I had expected at the price range, and I'd say this is your average sushi place - keep your expectations in check, and it'll be OK.  On the plus, service was nice enough!  (Asked what we thought of the food halfway through our meal)  Also, the heat's put on blast during winter, which is a good thing to have if you're sitting near the doors.  Even in the frigid winter months, it's still pretty warm and cozy no matter where you sit."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I've only tried their lunch and I love it. 

They have a great assortment of lunch specials but my favourite is the sushi lunch. You get about 8 sushi pieces with an assortment of sashimi and one maki roll of 8 pieces. This is very filling! All for $13. If you're like me, where you go for lunch specials in the annex for $8... This may be considered expensive, but you get what you pay for so it is worth the spurge. 

The restaurant is very small, so you should get there before 12 on a work week or be okay with waiting for a bit. Most people who eat there at lunch also work in the area so they are fairly respectful of their time and don't linger even after their meal is done. 

For anyone in a time crunch, as long as you are able to get a seat, the service is quick and the food as well."}
{"text":"Good price, great food! Loved the Japango - it had a really nice flavour I'm not sure I can place - but loved it. The ginger ice cream was also a nice treat."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. 

Came one night around 8:45, noticed that they close at 10 pm, so we wanted to just get take out.

We pulled into the parking lot, and saw the waitress constantly looking out at us. As we walked towards the restaurant, she went to close the blinds and turn the \"Open\" sign off. She then signalled they were closed with her arms. 

I'm disappointed that they didn't at least tell us they were closed verbally, but made such obvious attempts to turn us away. Also, with the restaurant closing at 10, they should take they final seating at 9 pm.

Although I will update my review if I decide to go back and not get turned away at the door."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a nice sushi treat in downtown! It is less expensive than jabistro and still offers quite delicious meals even using west coast standard. I would think of the closest comparison would be JapanGo but I like this place better because it offers a little more seats and the chef sometime changes around the presentation and make it more interesting. Best miso soup I have ever had, reasonable price too!"}
{"text":"I can't help feeling like the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have risen slightly.

Having said that, the sushi is still amazingly fresh and tasty, and reliably good quality every time.

I will keep going back regardless, but $45 including tax and tip for dinner for two (three sushi rolls) is a bit on the expensive side. Maybe it's just me but I can't shake the feeling that it used to be way cheaper!"}
{"text":"I liked how they quickly gave us tea, soup, and salad the moment we sat down. Tofu was also brought to us, on the house. If I had the chance, I would come here again! The sashimi was fresh, and it was also affordable!"}
{"text":"Little restaurant that's a bit hidden. Pretty small but you can make reservations ahead of time. Quick service and gets your order ready quickly. 

Chirashi (~$20) - MEHHH, can't decide whether I would or wouldn't recommend but if I went back I wouldn't get it again. For the price you can get better portions but the quality of fish they give you is quite good. 

If you came here, I definitely recommend getting their rolls instead. Their Japango and Dragon rolls are delicious and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Meh.

The reviews were so compelling that we had to try it out.  On the favourable side, the presentation was fantastic, and typically associated with sushi that costs notably more.  We also appreciated the miso soup and salad being served so promptly.  The sushi itself was decent.  We started with the tuna tar tar for $10 and it was reasonable.  It was nice that it was served with fresh avocado.  We tried the Japango roll, which was about the best thing we ate.  The spicy salmon roll was fine - a bit light on the salmon.  The most disappointing thing was the shrimp tempura which was soggy - despite one having the reasonable expectation for something crispy and fresh.  While everyone we interacted with was pleasant, the food was not enhanced by the elevator muzak playing in the background.  We're unlikely to return, but by no means did we experience a bad meal, just not a great one."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my Cali beau here for Valentines day and our taste buds went straight to heaven.  
We sat at the bar to enhance the experience and ordered mainly sushi/sashimi.  

Must tries:
Butter fish, yellow tail, spicy scallop wrapped with tamago, and salmon roe

I was blown away by the garnishing found on most of our orders.  They really know what they're doing when it comes to pairing - notably the yellow tail sushi topped with jalapeno pepper.  Everything was excellent quality including the soy sauce and wasabi. However, the miso soup, salad and appetizers we order were just average.  The ambiance was average but the presentation and service makes up for it. The sushi chefs are personable and hand delivered most of our dishes at the bar.  We were given free ice cream at the end of our meal.  I will definitely be coming back here again and again...

This place did me proud for Toronto!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday around noon.  The small restaurant that seats maybe 20 or so people was sun filled and bright.  Staff was very friendly and we were one of the first dine-in patrons of the day.

We ordered: 
Seafood Udon $15
Chirashi $13
Sashimi Lunch $14
Salmon Teriyaki Lunch $10

The salmon teriyaki was good, according to my mom, and she is a picky eater; especially with her fish.  The main came with some steamed veggies and rice, a very healthy option.  She noted the veggies were a touch over salted.  The portion of salmon was small, about 3 thin pieces just over the size of a babybell cheese.  

The chirashi was good, it came with about 12 pieces of sashimi, including tuna, seared tuna, salmon, butterfish, another seared white fish (talapia maybe?) some salmon roe, seaweed salad and rice.  It was filling for me (but I had a small appetite that day. The cuts of fish were good and not just the ends which I see at a lot of other places.

The sashimi lunch was very similar to the chirashi, minus the rice and I think had maybe 1 or 2 more variations of fish.

Seafood Udon:  the udon was silky smooth and came with a miso-mushroom based broth; very light and flavourful.  Shrimp tempura, imitation crab, fried egg and mushrooms to top off the dish,  Good but not worth the money.  Should have more seafood.

The food was average however the unfortunate part of our experience was that all the food came at different times, my mother ate first and nearly finished her salmon by the time my sister and I received our chirashi and sashimi plates. And they totally forgot about my dad's Udon!  He did not get to eat until about 40 minutes after ordered which was very unfortunate.  The staff was very apologetic as apparently the chef forgot about the order.  They gave us a free fried tofu appetizer which was nice."}
{"text":"Wow! Sushi is definitely in the top tier of Toronto sushi and for the price it can't be beat.  I go here usually around 2 or 3 times a month whenever I need a boost in my mood or a good meal with friends.  The dynamite roles are delicious and surprisingly spicy.  The sushi lunch special is top notch and if you are in a group getting a boat is a great idea.  

Definitely top notch place and will keep going for years to come."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi is one of my favorite spots for a la carte sushi. Their fish is fresh daily so be sure to ask the chef if there are any specials for the day and for their recommendations.

Service has always been attentive when I've visited. They bring your tea, miso and salad within five minutes of seating.

The space is a bit cramped and have limited seating. Best to make reservations before you make the trip here."}
{"text":"Having had tried crunchy salmon sushi rolls from a take out sushi bar, I thought it was time to check out a real sushi restaurant. Nestled on the outskirts of Yorkville, Wow! Sushi is warm and comfy establishment. We walked in around 5:30 and the place was empty, but quickly filled up to a capacity by 6 (also note this place is pretty small). Once we walked in we were greeted with a Japanese hello from the sushi chef. We were seated quickly and given complementary miso soup and green tea. We took in our surroundings, a red wood finish with authentic Japanese decor. The place was quiet homely and felt like we were somewhere in rural japan. Our server was adorable; she barely knew English but tried very hard to help us out, as we were newbies to sushi. We ended up ordering the Louis, Dragon, Calforina, and Spicy Salmon rolls. All our dishes looked great, but tasted very similar to one another. Considering that I am not a sushi expert, I didn't enjoy my meal all to well. Perhaps sushi is no for me, but I preferred the fast food sushi that I had prior. All in all the atmosphere is great and so are the people, unfortunately the place thought me that sushi is not for me."}
{"text":"It pains me to drop the rating on WOW as this used to be my fav place for sashimi, however today's plate was disappointing.

Firstly, the server got my order wrong.  I ordered the sashimi lunch, which is the same thing I order on every visit so there's no way I could've said it wrong, but instead came a sushi lunch.  This resulted in a slight delay in recieving the correct sashimi lunch.

The sashimi was so basic today, no sea bream no uni no sweet shrimp.
What annoyed me was how small tge sashimi was cut, it was only 1/3 of an avg slice of fish, so they definitely skimped on both variety and portion size today.

It's not like quality went down because it was busy or anything either, as we were the only table...

Overall a disappointing experience and I wont be back for a while.  I am posting photos of ALL the sashimi lunches I have had here for comparison purposes."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is legit. Freshest sushi and sashimi I've had in a long time. I've learned to be critical of any establishment that has an exclamation mark in the name but my initial skepticism was erased at first bite. The best was the hamachi. Had to get a double order because of how awesome it was.

Be warned though - this place can be considered pricey. $6-8 per nigiri and $14-18 for the sashimi cuts (slices of 4). The cuts were also on the smaller side (real Japanese portion). Price / portion aside, this place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Decided to quell my Japanese food urges today with a visit to a place I'd never been to before. Verdict? Good call. 

Service was nice and loud, kind of Guu-esque in the way they said hello as you walked in. 

Ordered the lunch Chirashi (by the way, lunch here is until 4:30pm, unlike some of the other Japanese places which end at 3:30pm) along with Aji sushi, which they'd gotten 'just that morning.'

When I got the horse mackerel, I can definitely say that it was super fresh -- probably the freshest aji I've had.

The chirashi's plating is a little conventional, but sometimes you do get bored of the usual presentation. All of the fish was very fresh, with the standout being the BC tuna which was positively silky and oh-so-tasty-melt-in-your-mouthy. The escolar seemed to be a tad overblowtorched though, which is a slight disappointment. I will however chalk it up to the fact that anyone can make mistakes! 

If you do go (which you should, by the way!) do remember that it seats only around 20 people. Cheers!

{"text":"Wow Sushi is a nice and affordable place for both lunch and dinner with a variety of combos in tempura, sushi, sashimi, or whatever you want really! I went on a Sunday evening and it was a fairly calm atmosphere with not too many people, which is surprising considering how good it is for the price. 

You can get full on their big rice bowls (Eel/Sashimi for $15, Pork/Chicken for $13), or their mains which range from $13 all the way up to $45 for the Sashimi Platter. The platter came with 35 assorted pieces which rotate based on what the chef thinks is fresh. This time, there was stuff like hamachi belly, aji, and sea bream from Greece and Japan. 

The restaurant is fairly small, with about 35 seats and easy parking. 

For a full review, look on my new blog which you can find on my profile."}
{"text":"I'm wondering if they changed owners because the chef and the server are different and we have been here a few times over the past 2 years. Sushi was pretty good, service was good, but the tables could have been cleaner. The main menu is still the same but the lunch menu changed and seems to be cheaper now. The presentation of the food isn't as nice as before though. I would still continue to come back."}
{"text":"I have always been skeptical of restaurants off of Yonge as they are typically kitschy tourist traps so I was not particularly enthused when we first walked into Wow... But was my mind quickly changed!!!

Before even having decided on drinks, the waitress brought each of us a serving of miso soup and green salad. Nothing mind blowing but the thoughtfulness is appreciated.

We ordered the spicy scallop roll and the sushi and sashimi dinner. Everything was fresh, succulent and beyond expectations (for a meal under $50). I had always revered Japango or Sushi Couture as the best sushi joints in downtown Toronto but Wow has stolen my heart. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to give this place credit the fish is really tender and almost melts in your mouth, it definitely left me wanting more. Only complaint would be the price but I'm cheap and like value so I'll still give the place 5 stars based on great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Bought a medium party tray from this place to take out and ordered 2 uni sushi while waiting for my order.  The restaurant is small and cozy and the service is pretty good. While waiting for my order the waitress served us tea and gave us miso soup with our uni order which normally don't include the soup.  The party tray is pretty good. They gave us some premium sushi and both sushi and rolls are very good! I wouldn't definitely come back again for their other stuffs."}
{"text":"I've always thought Yonge and Bloor lacked good restaurants.  My friend introduced me to Wow Sushi and I was wowed.  It's such a small unassuming place.  We got a medium boat for 3 of us and the sushi tasted great especially the one with garlic bits on top.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Our go-to Japanese place in this area. Their sushi rolls are great - Japango, dynamite, wow and Louis are the ones I've tried and they are delicious. Their tempura and agedashi tofu is my favourite. Always hot, fresh and crispy!! Sooo good. Their sashimi is pretty fresh too. The only thing is I wish they would have photos on their menu.. it would really help us decide what to get, lol. I have yet to try their chicken katsu don or their udons. Regardless, in this area.. you really wouldn't find a legit Japanese place. For the price, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"To quote my sushi-loving friend (and in one of my favourite complements to date) - \"Kasey, you are really awesome at finding sushi places from Yelp!\". If you knew this friend, you'd know what a big deal this was - so to you Yelp, I say thank you. Which brings me to lunch at Wow Sushi last week. After meeting said friend just over on Bloor, we were looking for a delicious and budget-friendly catch-up lunch in the area. You wonderful Yelpers lead me to Wow Sushi, and as the name says - Wow! We were greeted in the small but comfortable restaurant by the sushi chefs and waitress, with tea and miso soup (along with salad) that quickly followed. We both ordered the chirashi lunch - $15 for a dish of gorgeous looking (and delicious fresh tasting!) sushi. Friendly staff that were helpful and didn't rush us, and a comfortable spot for a 3 pm weekday lunch. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'd be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite sushi place in the whole of Toronto! The dynamite rolls and also prawn tempura sushi are my go to orders. I ordered a sushi lunch once and they were super helpful when I wanted to substitute one roll for another. Very reasonably priced and worth a visit! Their green salad is also one of the best I've had. The only downside is that it's a very small place so if it's packed you may have to wait a little for a table."}
{"text":"The beef lunch $13 (with the name yaki-something) was a teeny tiny portion of shaved marinated beef with bean sprouts. From the description on the menu (AAA prime beef whatnot) I thought it would be a piece of steak, but what we were served was more like tiny shavings of beef.

My mom ordered the salmon lunch ($11), which was 3 small pieces of salmon and some steamed veggies, quite bland. Nothing special.

After tax and tip, it was definitely not worth it. I was quite upset because I didn't realize that if I had walked a little further on Bloor I could have had a bento box with a lot more food for the same price."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but the sushi in this place is out of this world!  Now it's going to be hard for me to settle for buying sushi at a grocery store.  The atmosphere is cozy but small for my liking. I don't care if II have to be packed like a sardine when it's busy there, I am going back and getting more sushi from here."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this little gem and sushi has undoubtedly become a staple food in my weekly diet.

Why you should eat here: 
- Fish is always fresh, service is great, and the food is made by authentic sushi connoisseurs

What you should eat: 
- Japan Go Maki - California roll wrapped in seared salmon and scallop (eel substitution available)
- Sashimi - every type of fish is delicious. After watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I always order the Tomago Sashimi to gage the restaurant's authenticity. Order the Tomago A La Cart to get it swapped into the Sashimi dinner, definitely worth the try. 
- Unagi donburi - Because I love eel and Wow Sushi does not disappoint. 

Other: 
- Delivery is free if you make an order over $20.
- They're great at making substitutions and alterations to the sashimi and maki orders. I have a shellfish allergy and they've always been very accommodating. 
- Seating is limited, recommend you make a reservation and go with a group no larger than 4. 

Rating Summary: 
Food: (9/10) - food here is legit, sashimi is always fresh
Atmosphere (6/10) - classic petite Japanese restaurant
Service: (10/10) - tea service was in check, glass was always full"}
{"text":"One of the cheapest set lunch menus that I have seen in Toronto, although boyfriend from Vancouver almost had a heart attack seeing the prices.

Right when we sat down, we were serve with miso soup. Then we ordered our combos and were given salads right away. 

Fish was tasty. I had the sushi lunch ($13) and my boyfriend ordered the chirashi lunch ($14). I liked all my nigiri and one was uni! We both enjoyed the rice which was seasoned and held together nicely. The chirashi was not all contained in a bowl but spread out on a plate, and it also had uni which my boyfriend enjoyed. We also tried sea bream from Japan, sushi 2 pcs for $7, and that was only okay, not mindblowing and not particularly better than the other nigiri that we had. I'd stick to just the combos."}
{"text":"If I were not accidentally coming into a busy rush hour, then I would not expect  such a good review rated restaurant should have a under expected sushi quality and squared hand rolls."}
{"text":"I have had the maki dinner here a few times and have always enjoyed it. Occasionally I like to have the fried chicken as an appetizer. 

I usually have my food delivered and it tastes as good it did in the restaurant and is still warm when it arrives.  

The restaurant atmosphere is friendly and cosy. 

One of my favourite places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"I mean it's not the best but it's not the worst. The service is super duper fast but the food is really meh. I ordered the pork Katsu don and the breading on the pork was really soggy. Like REALLY soggy. It wasn't just a but softened or anything but it literally dissolved the moment I put it in my mouth. Even picking up a piece with my chopsticks would make the breading smush. Despite the outside being super wet the pork was surprisingly dry. The rice was also really over cooked and mushy which didn't really help the also mushy texture of the pork. At the bottom of the bowl there is literally liquids pooling there. Plus I found an egg shell in the rice. But the prices are reasonable, the service is fast, the location is convenient. But sadly the food is not that good."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was around the time it opened many moons ago. I live across the street and have an obsession with sushi, match made in heaven, right? No dice, though, as I was very disappointed at the time, and never returned. The rolls were tiny, the fish was chopped, the flavours were run-of-the-mill, and the prices were through the roof. BUT I went back last night, for the first time in years simply due to location and convenience on a late Sunday evening, and it has decently picked up. The rolls are still tiny and the prices are still high but some interesting flavours are now present, making the trip at least worthwhile."}
{"text":"Been there twice in the past month and wasn't impressed either time. Food was decent at best and service was just OK."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a date the other day. I had the chirashi sashimi and rice platter. I'm Japanese and from Japan so I can be alittle critical when it comes to non Japanese, Japanese food. The rice was really well done. Good selection of sashimi but it was pretty bland."}

My gooder friend Minnie and I needed an edible pick-me-up...mostly because lately it just seems like she wants to cheer me up...I wanted to try Wow! since a friend posted pictures.  Of course after 14 or so years in Toronto I never expect anything from sushi joints...save and except paying way to much for substandard sh*t.

Now wait, before you angry Torontonians sling your insults, be damn sure you know what you're talking about more than I do.  Like, be sure-sure...because I know.

The biggest problem us Vancouverites have with sushi in Toronto is the rice and the way the sushi is crafted - big and without any finesse.  We don't necessarily take issue with the fish because we get that its all about geography.

But let's not get into a Toronto sushi debate - you'd lose.  Never mess with the girl on edge.

Wow! is cute.  Friendly and oh so Japanese.  We ordered one of my all-time favourite japanese dishes: Agedashi Tofu and it was delicious - the first time in Toronto that I didn't want to spit it out.  It was exactly like home, but reminiscent.
 
Then my buddy and me shared a small sushi boat.  And plate after plate it was was shut-the-*bleep*-up surprising.  I loved it.  

The makis were well-rolled, the perfect size (not a giant wad of bad sushi rice and tasteless fish).  The rice was good, proper versus offensive.  The maki/nigiri were well-adorned with other tasty tidbits.  I loved the Japango roll and the spicy tuna (a really amazing, spicy, slightly creamy sauce, not a dollop of sirrachia like they do down on Bloor).

The nigiri made this BC girl proud.  My favourite was the albacore tuna (with a littled roasted garlic oil) and the sea bream from Greece (lightly torched to be smoky and sexy), and the butter fish, and the...well pretty much everything.

It was more than decent and I truly hope it stays that way.  (After all, Toronto has a way of wearing down restaurants the way they do people.)  
The small sushi boat is 24 rolls + 16 sushi for $45.  Exactly - amazing and cheap.  WOW!  The ultimate test will be what my sister thinks.  She's the hardest-to-please audience when it comes to sushi.  

As for me, I swear I have never been more impressed (in Toronto).  Makes me want to eat my words about never being able to find decent sushi here.  

Words.  Eaten."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me and it was good. Staff was perfect and friendly. Food was your average. I wasn't sure what the hype was about but would go back."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, simple/straight forward menu, polite service

Go with the Sashimi dinner (18 pieces $26) - you won't be disappointed. Mine came with butter fish, salmon, tuna, seabream, shrimp, yellow tail, and mackerel to name a few. Some were smoked, others were lightly seared and dipped in a soy/garlic sauce, and most came as is - sweet, delicate, melt in your mouth amazingness. Drool. 

This is a small no frills neighborhood shop so not great for groups and be prepared to wait. While we were eating several people came to pick up large to go orders. Wish I could go for dinner tonight..."}
{"text":"Wow is one of the better sushi joints downtown and definitely one of the ONLY sushi establishments where the owner/staff are actually Japanese! (If you're Asian you know what I'm talking about...and it's a BIG DEAL) 

Sushi is fresh and I find the quality very high for the price. Excellent value there. The guys behind the counter are skilled and avoid slicing huge pieces of sashimi or stuffing oversized mayo-y rolls.  Everything is appropriately sliced bite sized, and for the rolls all the add-ons are minimalist, which is ideal. The hamachi is particularly good in my opinion, tuna great as well - again a good sign because when the fish isn't fresh you get lots and lots of salmon. Wow even carries uni most the time, again, a true testament to the quality and freshness. 

The best thing at Wow is their nabeyaki udon. It is a warm hug in a bowl and there is no udon even comparable in Toronto. They make their own dashi broth and it's the type of broth that gets better and better the more you slurp. Best part is it's LOADED with fish, scallops, mushrooms, just tons of flavour and texture mixed in...not just sad noodles in broth. 

If it's cold outside or you're having a bad day, do yourself a favor and go eat this nabe udon. You will leave feeling transformed with warmth and happiness. Your taste buds and tummy will applaud you. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"This is actually more like a 4.5, cause I absolutely love this place. Great food and great service. Boyfriend and I ordered the 40 pc sushi boat, and instead of coming in a boat the sushi comes in waves (which was good cause it helped pace my eating so i didn't inhale everything in one go). Everything presented to us was amazing! Unlike typical sushi joints (mainly the AYCE ones), the sushi is actually more fish/filling than rice. There was one particular piece of sushi where the fish ACTUALLY melted in my mouth. No joke. One second I was chewing on it, next second it was gone! In addition I also think that $45 for 40 pieces of well made sushi is extremely fair, since it only works out to a bit more than $1 a piece. Also, despite the fact that the sushi isn't packed with rice you still leave the place extremely full and satisfied. My only wish is for them to expand their business so I can sit more comfortably in the restaurant, since it is an extremely small place. They may also benefit from improving their plating because although the individual pieces of sushi looked amazing, the boring plain white plate kind of took away from the \"beauty\" of the sushi in a way (not that important IMO, but I'm sure some ppl actually care). Overall, I can not wait 'till I return to this place to try other things!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a pleasant surprise - 3.5 stars. The small sushi restaurant provides minimal decor but makes up for it with good quality sushi at a low price point. 

WoW is a lower price alternative to my \"go to\" Sushi restaurant - Yuzu. I'm told the WoW sushi chef once worked at Yuzu which explains some obvious similarities I noticed right away (Regulars at Japango will also notice these similarities as well).

I shared the small sushi boat with another Yelper. The boat included the following:

- 8 pieces of spicy salmon roll. Rolls were a little on the small side but good flavour and not too much spicy sauce.

- 8 pieces of Japango roll (also shows the connection to Yuzu / Japango). Again, the roll was a little on the small side but tasted great.

- 8 pieces of Tuna roll, probably my least favourite.

- 16 mixed pieces of Sushi - this was the real standout for me. Not your standard fish selections (see photos). Just like Yuzu, I loved the butter fish (but the pieces are smaller). They use the blowtorch to alter the fish textures.   

The one negative was that they served everything on separate plates which was a problem for the small table. We had no room for our drinks.

In comparison to Yuzu (it's a natural comparison)  - the fish portions are smaller, presentations simpler and the Sushi pieces lack some of the unique spices... but the lower prices make WoW a viable option for sure. 

I may not rank WoW at the top of my list but at this price point, I will be back for sure.

{"text":"Really disappointed about the size of these rolls! The pictures on the website are really deceiving. They are pretty much just bite size rolls. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dining at this spot after reading all the rave reviews. I was prepared for disappointment as places usually don't live up to the hype. I have good news here folks this one does and more. 
I went for an early lunch (actually walked in when they opened the door at 11 AM) There were only two other diners in the place and they ordered cooked food so I was glad that I had the full attention of the sushi chef. I asked the chef what he would recommend and he said I should go for the lunch sushi combo. I took his advice and waited anxiously. In the meantime I was given a bowl of miso soup, Side of Salad and some tea. Nothing special here just your watered down miso and regular green tea. Salad was actually sub par but I am not a salad eater so could care less. 
The lunch special arrived pretty fast and was a decent sized serving consisting of maguro, sake, butter and white fish and on the side was a salmon roll. Visually appealing for starters. I asked the chef whether he had put any wasabi in sushi (as not to offend him) and he recommended I use the a small dab of wasabi to get the right taste (I wish I had brought my own tube of real wasabi, yes I am one of those people who take their wasabi to the restaurants!)
I went for the rolls first the salmon was fresh but kind of lost itself with the creaminess of the rest of the items. The rice was done very well BTW. 
I cleansed my palate with some ginger and then started with the maguro, excellent ratio of rice to fish just the way it is in Japan full marks here. Sake (Salmon) was great  and so were the other two fish especially the butter fish had nice lightly grilled consistency . I wish I could have this meal with Sake but heck it was not even noon. 
High recommendation here folks for the lunch.
So why not the 5 stars? a) I have to come back for dinner and get a whole experience with some good sake and real wasabi as the sub par stuff that's served here doesn't do it justice. b) though I am not a salad eater but it was not good and miso was weak.  c) the roll was weakest Part of lunch.
But for all this goodness under 20$ including tax and tips run don't walk here for lunch."}
{"text":"I went for the first time with another friend of mine and it was really comforting. I didn't expect it to be as small as it was, but walking in they all kindly greet you and have you seated right away, serving you this delicious soup and salad (It doesn't get included in the check). Food wise I found their dishes really clean, I grabbed some sushi rolls and I really must recommend the Philadelphia sushi, my absolute favorite! not expensive either. I find that it being a smaller restaurant they're really welcoming and always interactive when you need something. Though I wish they really explained their menus since it was kind of difficult to figure out what was what at once. But overall I really enjoyed the first time visit!"}
{"text":"Overall, I was not disappointed. The sushi was great -- very fresh. The price was fair. It is not the cheapest sushi you can find in Toronto, but for the price, it definitely beats places like Sushi Club, New Gen, and Sushi on Bloor. The service was very prompt and friendly; I enjoyed receiving soup, salad and water right away -- it is a small gesture, but it goes a long way. The atmosphere is fine; it is what you'd expect from a modest/average sushi place. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I think the sushi pieces have shrunk.  Also, not as much care is being put into the cutting of the rolls.  I was disappointed.  The fish is still fresh though.  The service was efficient and courteous.  In terms of presentation and value, I think Wow! has lost its \"Wow!\" factor."}
{"text":"Cheap as fuck, not the prettiest but the best quality for the price and legit service.  Would recommend especially the nigiri combo's sooooo good."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Another new sushi joint that opened in the east end of Markham. This is a typical Japanese restaurant serving up the usual appetizers, sashimi, sushi and bento offerings. 

Was there a few days after it opened and observed the following: 

- Salad was a bit overly dressed but apparently that has been improved after my last visit.

- Maki and sushi rolls were prepared nicely. The combination of toppings and added crispy garlic flakes created a very nice texture flavour profile. 

- Definitely give their WOW Sushi roll a try. Speciality rolls in general were better than Ai Sushi if you want something that's more unique.

- There were also some interesting pieces of raw fish as part of their combo platters. However, they could possibly provide a bit more variety as there were quite a few pieces of fish that were torched. 

- For uni lovers, it was significantly better here than Ai Sushi.

- Service was very attentive and thoughtful. We were given complimentary edamame as well.

- Prices are very reasonable for the quality of fish that you are getting.

I will need another visit or two before I can truly say whether this is a 4 star rating or keeping it as is."}
{"text":"It's a cozy place and the meals are all presented very nicely. Most of all it is very good value for the price and the sashimi and sushi rolls are all so fresh.  We've been here many times and it's always consistently great"}
{"text":"Very small portion.
The ingredients are ok, not big fan.
Absolutely no UNI in the chirashi dinner"}
{"text":"(Technically 4.5 but that's not an option) Ordered twice from Wow Sushi (off Just Eat) and both times have been great. Delivery is prompt and the sushi is fantastic. 

The Japango, Young, and Louis Rolls are worth a try (especially the Japango with the awesome sauce). The salmon sashimi was just ok. It was a bit pricy and didn't really \"wow\" me so in the future, I'd probably just stick to trying out new rolls and re-ordering my favourites.

Overall, Wow Sushi offers a lot of variety and the prices - for the most part - are fair. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"We visited wow sushi during a lunch time on a week day. We were the only customers present, yet they seemed to be rushing to get us kicked out as soon as we finished our food. The food was pretty good but customer service was a turn off."}
{"text":"Food that came out of the kitchen was good, food from sushi bar was just ok.. Maki rolls were poorly made, falling apart and all different sizes.. Never had a spicy salmon roll with cucumber in it which was different.. Service and food comes out fast. All in all not bad  but a little disappointed..."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to the area and was looking for a new sushi joint. We have been here twice for lunch and will definitely be visiting again. 

The quality of the food is superb, everything is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the chirashi or sushi lunch. The chirashi here is not your traditional sushi over a bed of rice, instead it is presented beautifully on a plate and you get some seared sushi too! The pricing is quite fair. I've paid much more for chirashi at other places and it was of lower quality and presentation. We've eaten A LOT of sushi...and this place surprised us with their quality (nothing will ever compare to fresh sushi in Japan...but for Markham/Toronto - this is pretty good). 

The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, it's not a fine dining fancy place, but everything is clean and neat."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi I've had in Toronto! As soon as you sit down your given green tea, salad and miso soup along with the menu. 
When at wow, I always order the boat, which is a selection of sushi and rolls. The fish is top quality and fresh. The rolls are delicious and beautifully plated. I always leave satisfied and full! This may be the last time I write a review for a sushi place because every time I crave sushi I find myself at wow!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for 2 years. I've been very satisfied with their quality. However I can tell that the quality has decreased over the past months. 

The sashimi cuts are becoming smaller. Each bite is more spongy and watery. They've been searing the outside of each fish to conceal that watery taste. 

I've ordered 2 pieces of sushi along with my mains. It didn't come even after 30 minutes of waiting. So I had asked the waitress for updates and she said that it's being made. 15 minutes later I asked again, and another waitress told me that they're too busy. 

They took another order as priority over mine when I ordered before them. Being \"too busy\" is not an excuse. It was literally 2 sushi pieces. There was no apology. 

Im quite disappointed. I don't think I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is located at the side of Charles Street. With its big red restaurant sign, you simply cannot miss it. There are only 8 tables with a big counter for the chef to make sushi.

My friends and I ordered tuna, white fish and salmon sushi for appetizer. The dish is quite average and I was expecting wasabi inside the sushi. For main dish, we ordered chicken yaki udon, japango sushi and black dragon sushi.  

The chicken yaki udon was quite oily and the udon seem to mushed together and not fresh at all. The sushi though is a lot better that the japango is a little spicy with a crispy feel. 

Overall, it isn't a bad restaurant but quite average."}
{"text":"A small sushi restaurant with good food & lovely service. I kinda wish they had a buffet style offering, but I know the place is too small to accommodate that. All of our food was spot on and the servers were great. We went with a group of 4 and our food was always very fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. I just wish that there are more options on the menu.
I ordered the raw shrimps, my favorites and they are nicely sized and fresh.  I also ordered ikura, salmon roe, sushi. Uni is very fresh there. I can taste their juice. 
Quite disappointed at the Chirashi plate.  The fish selection is not enough. But good that i ordered the al la carte to made up."}
{"text":"Wow! No sushi belly!! Toronto sushi often gives me an achy belly, and I keep trying different places anyway in the hopes of finding delicious, 'painless' raw fish. At Wow! I had more slices of sashimi, spicy salmon and tuna rolls than I recall having in Toronto in a long time. So fresh and succulent.

We had the maki dinner set, sashimi and dynamite rolls. The maki set had a generous amount of rolls and like I said, the sashimi was super fresh.

It's a little place on Charles that packs huge flavour. I was able to make 6PM reservations with no issues."}
{"text":"Slightly better than average sushi, lunch menu offers excellent value, yet dinner menu is overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from them on a cold Wednesday night.  The place was empty around 7:15pm when I got there, had one party of 2 show up around 7:30pm, but that was it.

Ordered their 22pc sushi/sashimi combo for $35, a spicy tuna roll and a few a la carte sushi pieces (sweet shrimp, squid, uni and scallop).  The rice on the sushi was pretty bad.  It was dry and not sticky at all.  It pretty much fell apart everytime I picked up a piece with my chopsticks.  The fish was all very fresh though.  One thing I really didn't like was their blow torched sushi.  All I tasted was the smokiness and it overpowered the freshness of the fish.  On a side note, I don't get this whole blow torched sushi trend, just give me fresh fish!!!!

While waiting for my order to be prepared (I didn't call ahead), the lady, whom I assume is the owner, served me a cup of green tea, nice touch!  She also gave me an order of miso soup with my takeout order. Very nice!

To end, average food, great service (takeout)."}
{"text":"The sushi was wow. We got a medium sushi boat for 4 of us and it was quite filling. The seared tuna and the miso soup were especially good. 
However, the restaurant itself is extremely cramped, the servers never really refilled our tea/waters and were not all fluent in English. There were some communication barrier and even though the sushi we had was delicious, half the time we honestly didn't know what we were eating. Only really loses a star for space and service."}
{"text":"Consistency is a problem. When we originally went here the food was amazing and delicious. Everything was well prepared and the sushi looked amazing. 

We came here a 2nd time, and ordered the small sushi boat again. Because we had a great experience the first time, I was really looking forward to dinner here. However, the 2nd time was disappointing. The sushi and presentation wasn't as good. One of the rolls we got, the rice was mushy and soft. I'm not sure if it was a different chef, but it wasn't the same.

We ordered the sushi boat to share. This is more than enough for 2 people. I was so full by the end of the meal. I enjoyed the Japango roll. The smokiness of the cooked salmon shined through and I loved the sauce they put on it as well. I usually don't like scallops, but I liked the ones on the sushi roll. Luckily the Japango roll was still good, and it was my favourite. 

The place is small and they definitely make use of every available space that they have. So if you come here during the rush hour you might not get a seat, and have to wait a bit.

I'm on the fence about this restaurant, my experiences here were so different. I'm not sure I would be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come back again as we loved the sushi so much and the service was friendly. I decided to try the pork katsu don and didn't like it at all. The pork was super dry and chewy and the batter tasted like it was fried in old oil. The sushi was just as good as the first time though. 
We'll still come back again, but only for the sushi, not the rolls or cooked food. Don't expect large sushi pieces/rolls from here either, but we prefer it that way."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on two separate occasions, I ordered a chirashi bowl and sushi dinner. The rice is the most important part of a sushi meal and wow sushi did not disappoint. The fish was fresh and with each meal I left extremely satisfied. As you sit down you receive a miso soup and salad and the orders don't take long. The restaurant is small but I did not have issues getting a table on weeknights. One of the best places for sushi without hurting your wallet."}
{"text":"Wow!
Itadaki-masu!

I was there last Friday and what a treat it was! First let's get the bad out of the way and trust me this is a bit of an afterthought since the real show stopper in this tiny Japanese eatery is the consistent Homerun that is the food!

Yes, this place is tiny, 10 tables, plus seating at the sushi bar, however walking in here feels as if you have strolled into Guu's smaller brother of a restaurant but without the decor. Background music is some sort of soft/romantic jazz which is definitely out of place here, however not overly intrusive. 

On my visit the waitress was a little lost and one of the (two) brothers who own the place had to take reigns of our order but that was forgiven. 

The positive? The delicious food! The sushi is amazing. You can taste the love in each piece. Obviously made with skill and concern, each dish is brought to you wonderfully (yet simply) presented. 

Along with some plum wine, our Salmon Teriyaki dinner was tasty and obviously low in fat. Which in some places you can see the lower quality of the salmon by the cheer amount of fat that has leeched onto your plate. Not the case here. 

The Calapilla Maki and Rainbow Rolls tasted as if a touch of heaven and raw fish decided to have wonderful and tasty roe together! :P The flavour was full, balanced and satisfying! Not to mention the staff at the locale seems to not only be friendly but willing to bend over backwards for you... You simply cannot fake that sort of commitment to attention!

Now, another thing to be warned it that each dish, although illustriously made, is quite small portioned, specially, if you are used to the dirt cheap proto-options like Sushi On Bloor.

Then again, Wow and SOB are in completely different leagues. While the latter is a cheap simile of sushi, Wow tries to go the true path and as such you will pay for it, both in serving size and in price. 

While you can have a filling, albeit non-authentic meal at SOB or New Generation for about $10, expect a more realistic $20 -30 per head at WOW. As some of their diner dishes pass the $22+ mark. 

For example, for the three dishes mentioned above plus a glass of wine and plum wine, it came down to about $60. Where we stuffed? No. 

Were we happy and satisfied. Yes. 
So is it authentic? Well, the place is run by two  brothers and the vibe is definitely closer to places like Guu than any of the other dozen or so-called Japanese Sushi places in the Annex. Definitely the best sushi in the area by boats, sushi boats! ;-)
 
I will definitely be back!
Wow indeed!"}
{"text":"This place is a few visits short of becoming a 5-star for me-- it would certainly be up there but I need to be a full-fledged regular and be willing to trek across the city for this sushi- I am not.  but it is possibly top 5 in my books EVER (I've also lived in Vancouver and SF so that's saying something)

I can't say much more than others here other than it is 1) yes, pricier than your average combo meal you would get at teh cheap sushi places on yonge or bloor- but it is real quality.  They also had some things that I've never tried and the presentation and quality are just top notch.

If in the neeghbourhood, I would never pass this up- definite best quality, good value sushi for a couple miles, at least."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see more a la carte places opening up in the Markham area. While I still enjoy all you can eat, I've found that I enjoy having good fresh and tasty sushi at a reasonable price. Having said that I've moved to Edmonton in the past year and sushi is good there but overly expensive for not amazing quality. One of my things I really wanted to eat this trip back was sushi, so after turning to Yelp to find a new place to try, I found WOW sushi and was pleasantly surprised. I went for lunch and got the sushi lunch special and my friend got the chirashi combo and we shared Boston and the Avocado/Salmon rolls all for a total of about $20/person with tips included. 

The sashimi had a varied assortment including uni which was surprising. All the sushi and sashimi were made with buttery soft pieces of fish and there wasn't an over abundance or sushi rice under the fish. I can say I loved how the sushi rice had a good amount of sweetness but it didn't overwhelm the fish and it found the right balance of rice and fish. I would say this is probably my new favourite place. The portion sizes were enough that I felt comfortably happy after the meal. All in all I would recommend this place no questions asked. Definitely worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place really is WOW-worthy!

I've seen this place on Yelp for awhile now and finally got a chance to try it. It's a small little place tucked away off of Yonge St, but it delivers in all the right ways. I thought it was neat that you get soup and salad almost immediately, even before you've ordered anything! That's a nice touch. 

I ordered the lunch sashimi platter, which was actually a beautiful looking dish. It tasted amazing just as well. You could tell the quality of the fish was very high. The butterfish was like heaven. My only issue was the use of roasted garlic on some of the sashimi pieces (I just didn't want to be burping that up all day!).

My friends got a selection of rolls. I thought they were delicious, although my friend wasn't keen on the spicy salmon roll. I think that's more due to the fact that he doesn't really like fish, and the fish used at this place actually tasted real! 

Overall, awesome place. I hope to be back soon.

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 4 times now and I'm noticing that their sashimi portion sizes are getting smaller and the fish not seemingly as fresh. This was my favourite sushi spot midtown but I may need to look for another go-to sushi place. 

When I come here I usually order the sushi lunch which is $13 and comes with soup and salad. It's pretty filling as there are 12 pieces and a variety of sashimi including my favourites, salmon and sea bream. The place is also very small. Only 6 tables so if you're coming around lunch or dinner you may want to call ahead to reserve or come earlier to get a spot."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal. Not exactly the best fish but dishes are tasty and plentiful. The Japango roll is my go-to. Servers are welcoming but the place is quite small. Reserve if you're going with a group!"}
{"text":"So here I am again 6 months later and they still have the $50 medium tray deal so I'm assuming the \"deal\" in its name is just a marketing scheme. 

As you can tell from comparing my two photos, they took out the uni sushi and replaced the salmon avocado roll with a (predominantly) tempura bits roll. They also changed the topping of the \"special roll\" from minced sashimi to a less appetizing mushy tempura bits mixture... 

It really became apparent to me this time that they've been cutting on costs, which is unfortunate. I'm no longer getting the types of sushi that I expected and anticipated for.. so this restaurant has dropped 1 star for my rating."}
{"text":"Sushi/sashimi and I have quite a love-hate relationship... I often crave them but I always end up feeling sick after a couple of bites. Raw fish, and even cooked rolls like california rolls don't sit quite well with me. It's probably because I've only had store bought ones or ones from restaurants that did not specialize in these dishes.

I came here with my friend who wanted to satisfying her craving for sushi. I hesitated a bit since I didn't think I could eat much but WOW, if raw fish is done right then it can taste amazing! We split a sashimi lunch and a sushi lunch between the both of us and it came to around $13.5 each + tip. Surprisingly, I ended up eating most of it! Also loved the dried garlic on top of the fish as it added a nice flavourful crunch to it.

As for the interior of the restaurant, it is very small with only 7 or so tables that seat 2-4 people each. There were two chefs who prepared the fish in an open kitchen and the service was attentive and friendly. 

Though I mentioned at the beginning of this review that I did not like sushi that much, I will be a hypocrite in saying that I will be back :)"}

We came here becuse we saw this on yelp labeled as \"hot and new\". First impression, this restaurant is small but there is enough space between each table. The server was friendly. After we got seated, they served us hot miso soup which is just right for winter time. 

The food was ok but it wasn't too impressive. 

Food presentation makes me feel like i am eatting all you can eat. They really need to make improvement on this! Food should look like a la carte. 

Nothing too impressive."}
{"text":"We randomly came across this location while doing a Google search because everything else around the area closed by 10 p.m. As soon as we walked in, we noticed how small the place actually was.  

FIRST off, I can't understand why the reviews here are so bad. Let's be real, I'm obviously not comparing this to a high end, posh sushi spot. No, it's not hip and trendy inside. But for the location it's in, the prices were ridiculously low while still offering many variations and quality food. They also put a generous amount of stuff inside the sushi rolls vs very little inside and mostly rice around used as a filler like some other (even high end) places that I've been to do.

We quickly figured that this was a mom and pop owned shop and that the guy taking the order had to have been the owner. He was super quick at taking our order but still understanding and accommodating... he was also ringing up orders at the register ( there were a lot of takeouts).

From this point on, we all had a feeling that we would like this place and that the food would be good! There are a ridiculous amount of different Sushi rolls to choose from. There is actually a whole separate menu for Vietnamese pho & Tonkinese soups too.

You will probably be saying \"WOW\" several times as you flip through the menu and notice the inexpensive prices, then another few \"WOW\"s as you're enjoying what you're eating and then for sure another \"WOW\" at the end when you get your bill to really reconfirm how good and inexpensive everything was!!"}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away a block south of bloor and Yonge. Friendly and fast service. They gave us the best table by the window. Lots of spicy wasabi !!"}
{"text":"Very fresh. And they don't put a lot of rice on their maki rolls (which is obviously a good thing). But their hours suck and it's so small :("}
{"text":"pretty good sushi. good service. knowledgable staff. 

small restaurant but it was not busy when we came in.
We ordered the small platter and a Wow roll. The small platter came with louise roll and japango roll.

I really liked the wow roll. The louise roll is good too but lacked some flavour. The japango and wow roll tasted similar except wow roll has tempura shrimp and japango has imitated crab. 

sushi was fresh. I really enjoyed it. flavours of the roll was great- tad saucy. The rolls are on a smaller side but overall we were quite filled with what we ordered.

pay in cash and tax is waived off"}
{"text":"DEAR WOW! CHEFS: I LOVE YOU. THIS IS MY FAVOURITE RESTAURANT. I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS.

Just wanted to get that out of the way. Another stellar dining experience today, this time with my sweet friend Eunice, who is the millionth person I've introduced to my favourite sushi spot. I also book numerous business lunches here.

Soup + salad were offered almost immediately after we sat down and our orders didn't take long at all. Eunice enjoyed her elaborate sashimi meal ($15), especially/despite (not sure which) the decorative horse mackerel carcass. My tuna sushi set ($12) was flawless, as usual. Butterfish best. Spicy rolls very spicy. Please see my previous review for more details.

The owner hooked us up with some scrumptious agedashi tofu on the house and the little crispy triangles came hot, liberally doused in sauce, seaweed and bonito flakes. Thank you!!!

Epilogue: I was excited to treat my friend to lunch but our server, despite my begging and the fact that I'd approached him first, refused to let me pay and took Eunice's blood money instead. \"DO NOT TAKE HER MONEY!\" I pleaded, and he ignored me. \"Why are you doing this?!\" I cried, and he gave Eunice her change. \"I will never forgive you for this,\" I said, literally verbatim, but he just smiled and nodded so I don't think the message was clear."}
{"text":"love this place! japango roll is my favorite. good lunch and dinner specials.  food is always fresh. love their torched, or roasted garlic topped sushi.  
been a regular for 3 years, they need to update their menu."}

Hands down, the best Japanese sushi restaurant in Canada.

1. Authentic Japanese people.
2. Superior attention to presentation and the finest details.
3. Most accommodating staff I've experienced.
4. Tastiest sushi and sashimi I've had in GTA
5. Best value in every category I can think of.

This IS a real Japanese experience, and better than any of the sushi I had during my travels through Japan.  

I'd say to order specific things, however everything I ate on both visits was outstanding.  Each piece had something new and different about it; tastes and aromas I'd never experienced.

Yes, it is THAT different.  Trust me, you'll love it!

 If I had to pick, I'd say the mackerel and escolar stood out on the sashimi dinner ($26). During two separate visits I had: Japanese Fried Chicken (tiny, crispy nuggets!), agedashi tofu (yum!), yakitori (tender and amazing), hokaido scallops (wow!) and the sushi dinner. The sushi dinner was just as amazing as the sashimi dinner. 

The food is so good here, you won't need wasabi or soy sauce. It's that good!  Not only is the sushi award winning, but the portions are amazing compared to the cost.  

This is a new restaurant and you can tell they're going overboard to make sure everyone will come back.  Our first visit we received a free appetizer which was just magnificent.

The one tweak I'd make would be the music. It wasn't horrible but didn't seem to quite fit the place.  I love to hear some Pizzicato Five or 
Maki Nomiya.

Liquor license is coming.

Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Before our main sushi pieces arrived, the server served us a portion of Agedashi Tofu that was on the house.  This was really nice and we enjoyed eating this complimentary plate of deep fried tofu with tempura sauce.  The tofu was crispy on the outside yet very soft and squishy on the inside with tempura sauce.  

The Louis Roll had shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, and avocado.  This roll was unique in the sense that each one was placed in 'formation' on the plate as if each one was lining up.  The spicy salmon and avocado were also piled on top of the shrimp tempura roll which made it look like a little appetizer instead of a sushi roll.  It tasted pretty good.  Although it was 'spicy salmon', it didn't taste spicy at all.

I absolutely loved the Japango Roll.  This one had California roll, salmon, scallop on top, and was torched.  It was also a little spicy too.  This one was the best tasting one since the scallop on top of the sushi roll was fresh and quite largely portioned.  A touch of torching completed the overall texture and taste of the sushi too.  It was just very well put together."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi lives up to it's name - but it's definitely a hidden gem in Toronto. Tucked away across from the Dollarama store near Bloor and Yonge, it's on a little side street of Yonge St., and looks pretty average from the outside. However, where the wow factor comes in is with the food and service. The portions are generous, the flavours are sensational, and the service is fast. It's quite a small place inside (cozy). My one complaint is about the space, but I know there's not too much they can do. I know real estate for a restaurant can't be cheap in downtown Toronto. That being said, I do wish tables were more further apart, because it feels like the people at the other table can totally hear your conversations and you can hear theirs. Too close for comfort haha. Otherwise, I'd give this place 5 stars. Good for dates or small groups (no larger than 4), this is not a place for a large social gathering. Definitely order the sashimi/sushi boat (comes on plates) and the tempura udon, so good!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I would declare this as the undisputed champion of sushi in Canada but I can safely say that this is one of the better sushi restaurants I've been to. 4.5 stars for me since it is yet to totally hit the tre 5 star experience. 

It's not cheap but for around $20 you can certainly have a very tasty sushi dinner. We had the black dragon roll along with the \"sushi dinner\" and the server went piece by piece describing them and in some how it was prepared which was a welcome first for me at a sushi restaurant. 

I would say out of the 10 sushi pieces, 5 had exceptional taste which I would love to try again. But for $22 I don't know if I can really afford to keep coming here when there are cheaper options available. The dragon roll was very tasty too, it seems like you can't go wrong with the food choices here. Add complimentary agedashi tofu and this place is a definite top spot for anyone looking for a sushi fix. 

The service was good, our tea had regular refills and the 2 guys serving were very friendly although I would have liked the service to be a bit quicker since this is a pretty small locaation. 

It looses out on the 0.5 star for the higher than average price (it's a very tough line to cross since you do get a great product in return) and the fact that \"wow sushi\" brings no \"wow\" to the actual restaurant atmosphere apart from their very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My go-to delivery sushi spot (when I am feeling like a little splurge) We tend to go for their sushi platters because we find we get good quality for the price of their sushi. Their nigiri are all very fresh and tasty. Some of their sushi are even torched! Delish! Sometimes you can even find 20% off Just Eat coupons if you order via Just Eats! They are fast with their delivery service but the delivery driver is a little rude and will count his tip infront of your face. Overall, good quality fish and great delivery service"}
{"text":"I picked up the sushi dinner from here for takeout and it was excellent. Still the best sushi I've had at this price range. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best taro sashimi I had & one of the best spicy salmon rolls! The place is small & had one server when I went; it can be a little slow to get the food but the wait is honestly worth the quality of the food you get. The fish is fresh (important!!!) and the size of the slices are generous."}
{"text":"Wow sushi lives up to its name. Wow!

After living in Richmond hill/Markham for so many years, my list of restaurants that I would want to go back to again and again is short. But Wow sushi is going on that list! 

Quality food. Good service. Comfortable seating. Reasonable price. What else can you ask for? 

I came her for dinner with a friend. We each spent about $25 and had really good sashimi, including toro, uni, shrimp. 

Ample parking in the plaza parking lot."}
{"text":"Wow!
Sushi. 

And I'm not jut saying that because I am amazed. 

This small place is a great addition to the common Chinese owned sushi places in the area. 
The fish was very fresh and I loved the presentation of my 18pc Sashimi combo. 
Some of the fish was served on beds of finely sliced cucumber with taro chips on top. My white tuna was not only on top of a Wakame salad but the edges were seared ! 

It was a bit pricy at $26 but the fish size portions were not skimped (like some other places ) and you get soup and salad. There wasn't else much on the menu except your general teriyakis and a myriad of rolls. 
I would come back here if I was craving raw fish. 

Te service was okay. Very rarely our tea cups were empty, but they also don't really come bug you for orders unless you ask them.  Maybe it's Japanese culture. 

Also small space means the table space also tight. I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow. 
Cozy place with friendly staff. Hand rolls were bomb."}
{"text":"I was really not wowed by this place. I had heard of it before. I had noticed the crazy amount of yelp reviews and the solid 4 stars. So my partner and I decided to try it out. It was within walking distance. You would think this would be a home run.

It's so tiny. I'm not sure if the upstairs is part of the sushi house, but we were shuffled into the tiniest little hole for two. In front of the steep staircase to the washroom. And the doorway to the kitchen.

Even before that, you walk in and just get hit in the face with the smell of fish. Good sushi houses don't smell like fish. That generally implies that the fish is going bad. I'm not saying the fish was bad when I ate it. But the smell of fish is not something I enjoy when going to eat sushi.

My dining partner didn't enjoy his Chicken Katsu very much. He didn't expect it to be quite as it was (chicken cutlet, breaded and baked and then cut into strips over too much rice). I found the sushi rolls to be small in size, which is good. But then it felt inadequate to the amount I was paying. Or rather, not a bargain, as the price per maki roll was cheaper than other places.

I think I will not be returning here simply because I've had much better sushi experiences at equally affordable prices."}
{"text":"Sushi here is so basic! I came here after reading the good reviews, but I was disappointed with what they had to offer.
I don't know what the big woop is about of this place. 
This place cannot even compare to Osaka."}
{"text":"This place is awsome! One of my favourite sushi restaurant of all times!
I haven't tried anything else other than the sushi boat (sushi&maki) but this is so good I never want to venture out and try something new. 

They have unique(don't worry it's the good kind of unique) sushi selections in their boat and will never serve you california rolls or the generic makis. It is a bit more expensive than most sushi restaurants but you won't regret paying extra for quality.

I will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This tiny place had delicious sushi, sashimi, endamame, and soup.  Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Salmon in philadelphia roll was not pink but brownish. Not fresh. Not particularly yummy :( didnt end up finishing it"}
{"text":"After eating at this place, I don't think I'll go back to eating at AYCE places. The food here is great and fresh. You get a free bowl of salad with a vinaigrette dressing and miso soup. I don't like miso soups from sushi places, but the soup here was different and pretty good. 

My 2 friends and I ordered the Dynamite roll, Spicy Salmon roll, Japango roll, and Butterfish sushi pieces. They were all good, but the Japango roll (a California roll topped with salmon and scalloped, then torched) was by far the best and our favourite. Everything combined so well together and it literally just melts in your mouth. It was like an explosion of heaven in your mouth. We also ordered a plate of the Yaki Beef Udon, which was flavourful and very tasteful. 

The service is outstanding, as the staff members are very friendly and on top of their waiting game. Our total bill was around $60 for the 4 rolls, udon, and 2 sushi pieces. So it turned out to be around how much you would pay for an AYCE lunch. Even though it was less quantity, the quality was 100 times better and we were all full. But not that gross fullness you get from AYCE. I wish I lived downtown so I can come here more often!!! WORTH IT. FIVE STARS."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check out a random sushi place downtown Friday night called Wow Sushi and it was exceptional rating speaks for itself.

I made reservations ahead of time because I heard this place always gets packed on a weekend evenings.

SERVICE: The staff were friendly and greeted us upon arrival as we were seated immediately. Even before ordering out food, tea, salad and miso soup was served right away. The server also offered complimentary black sesame ice cream when I asked what type of ice cream they had at the end of our main dish.

AMBIENCE: The restaurant had a very cozy and warm feeling with several small tables and there was a nice jazzy type music playing in the background.

FOOD: The food was what took me away as being a sushi conaisseur, I was blown away by the presentation and quality of the sushi and sashimi. We ordered the Global Leslie roll as was recommended by a friend and it was absolutely delicious and a type of roll never before had. It consisted of spicy tuna, red snapper and cucumber roll topped with unagi and avocado. It was fresh and tasty. Secondly, we ordered the sashimi dinner as the main entree to share and it was so beautifully presented, the fish size was somewhat small but it was fresh and cut perfectly. The platter also came with one piece of raw oyster which was also very tasty!

Overall, I was very impressed with Wow Sushi and it was worth paying the extra dollar or two."}
{"text":"Our Christmas was made merrier with a party tray from Wow Sushi! For $50, we had the chef's choice 66-piece tray. The sushi rice had a delicate vinegar flavor and there was a variety of fresh fish including uni! It was a popular dish at our party! 

We discovered this place after having lunch there the day before. I ordered the two roll combo for $7 and there were 16 pieces in total. I chose yam-avocado and spicy salmon, it was so good! The spicy salmon had a nice kick! My mom ordered the sushi lunch for $12 and each piece was packed with delicious and unique flavors."}
{"text":"Went last night @ 7pm. with my husband. We sat down and within 3 minutes were served water, salad and soup. We were going to order beer, but no one asked us. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 sushi dinners. 5 minutes later we get our sushi dinners, and subsequently, our apps. (edamame/ tempura) The sushi was decent but the rice was still warm. I found the fish to be a bit uneven, and hacked looking. Half way through our meal the server asked us if we were going to order anything else(?) (hey, I am still eating!!) She then proceeded to take my husband's sushi plate away, while he was still eating app's. So he has to eat tempura with no plate. RUDE. When we did ask for check it was already prepared. (what if we wanted an after dinner beer?) Anyway the food was decent but the rushed atmosphere was NOT. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came here today for my birthday lunch, choosing here over Osaka, because of the Yelp reviews.  This is another place where I totally disagree with my fellow Yelpers.  

We arrived at 12 noon and were the only patrons.  We ordered the Louis Roll, Sushi Lunch, Fried Chicken(starter) and Uni Sashimi.  First off the rice was too hard, seemed dry, and didn't seem fresh.  The sushi are small, like AYCE places.  The rolls are pretty small and are not uniform in diameter or height.     Only 2 other tables dined in, while we were there, and somebody else got takeout.  The uni sashimi was the only good thing about the meal and they were tiny pieces.  The fried chicken was ok, I've yet to eat bad fried chicken anywhere.  Sushi lunch is supposed to have tuna but we didn't get any.   Miso soup and salad was served with our lunch.  The single server was pleasant.

I don't understand how my experience differs so greatly to other Yelpers.  Supermarket sushi rice is better than the rice that I was served today.  I will not be back or recommend here to anybody."}
{"text":"I just moved from Van, the land of fresh and amazing sushi, and I had not found a single decent sushi place in downtown Tdot in three weeks.  I was getting depressed and worried.

Then a colleague from work recommended this restaurant.  I was dubious, but hopeful.

First off the restaurant is like two doors down from 7 West Cafe.  Major plus!

Then as soon as you're seated they serve miso soup and salad!  Ah-mazing!

And then I had the JAPANGO ROLL.  Holy crap this roll is DELICIOUS!  Seared salmon and fresh scallops!

Really cute hole-in-the wall restaurant.  Just love it."}
{"text":"Really small portions for the cost, doesn't stand out in taste, awkwardly designed Chirashi, and \"dinner\" doesn't really come with anything. 

There are much better options out there for the cost. I don't know how this place got reviewed so high."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night for a quick dinner. The place is small. Service is very friendly and attentive. We were given complementary tea, miso soups and salads right while seated. Ordered tempura dinner and my friend didn't like others (veggies, kanis) so we asked for all shrimps. We got 8 pcs for $15 pretty good deal! The sashimi is so delicious and fresh. I actually prefer it over the sushi rolls. The owner is a really nice Japanese guy and he even gave us black sesame ice cream on the house!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to wow! sushi for our 2nd year anniversary. It was great! The food was delicious, reasonable priced and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a girlfriend during the weekday lunch .really great sushi ,.great service.japango roll soooooo is good ! best sushi I ever had .all food are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi, so not just a clever name! Went for lunch on a Saturday, the restaurant is small but clean. I went with two friends, two of us had the sashimi lunch and the other had chicken katsu. The sashimi was lovely, varied and beautifully presented.

Our waiter was very attentive and brought over an on the house set of maki rolls which they were trying out, these were topped with scallops and were just delicious!

The fact that I am writing this review before I have had breakfast is a bad idea because now I just want to go to Wow Sushi. I will most definitely be returning there!"}
{"text":"We got the maki dinner, spicy salmon roll, and gyoza. The food was decent, but I've definitely had better sushi elsewhere for the price. The restaurant is quite cramped, so I wouldn't come here with a large group or with kids."}
{"text":"I wasn't WOWed with WOW Sushi. Although I didn't try too may items, the portions all just seemed a bit less than I expected. With the price I pay, I expected more. Granted that the quality is top notch and the service is great, I still expected more. 

Due to the overwhelming hype Yelp has given it, I wanted to try Wow Sushi ever since the first review. With my busy schedule and laziness I found myself here decades after inception. Now that I have tried it, I'm confused. 

I tried a few rolls, my favourite being the Capilla roll because of the spicy sauce. The freshness of the seafood was there but the portion was small. 

The store itself is quite small too. This isn't entirely a bad thing because it gives the sense of authenticity and exclusivity. However, larger parties would find it difficult to find room without a reservation or a wait. 

Overall, it's an alright sushi restaurant. I think I should go for another visit and go strictly sashimi on this hoe. But from what I had, it was just o.k."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review.

We came in for lunch and none of the tables in the place were clean, so we waited for one to be cleaned. This same thing happened to the next two or three customers who came in after us, and it was confusing to me why someone didn't take time to clean the tables in anticipation of future customers.

I had two medium-sized tempura sushi rolls that were very heavy on the tempura versus the fish. The rice also seemed kind of stale. My dad had the vegetable pad thai. It was a huge serving but mostly noodles, minimal vegetables. I did like the chicken gyoza appetizer, but was surprised that it was served with spicy mayo.

Prices were good, food was okay, but service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to it's name.  WOW, is this what sushi is supposed to taste like?  I've tried going here so many times during lunch at around 12:30 - 1 pm, but it's always packed.  This time, I came at 12 with coworkers and we were so lucky that we got the last table.  

We all ordered the sushi lunch and shared a spider roll between the three of us as well.  We were all very impressed.  My coworker from Vancouver had some bites into the sushi (which I think was butter fish) and he literally said \"oh wow\".  I felt the same way.

Details:

Food: Sushi lunch is reasonable price - I think $12-$13, had about 8 pcs of spicy maki and really fresh sushi.  Everything melted in your month.  The spicy maki had a nice kick to it and much better than any spicy salmon roll I've had.  Also, the Spider Roll actually had soft shell crab in it and had a great crunch to it (I am so sick of AYCE restaurants calling things Spider Rolls with absolutely no soft shell crab or very minimal).  In addition, the miso soup actually had great taste without being overly salty.  

5/5

Service: Fairly good, but I'm glad they took the time to serve our entire table at the same time.  Some Asian resto's do serve entrees to patrons at different times (not sure why though), so I have to give them credit for being served fast in such a busy place. 4.5/5

Verdict: Probably best sushi I've had in GTA, better than Mi-NE.  Just get there early or make reservations as it has less than 20 seats."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars. Yes it is good but I like Etsu better. The sushi at Wow is tasty but the pieces are a little small for my liking. I will say the service is very good."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about WOW Sushi 

I missed the Yelp event there a couple months ago regrettably and finally was able to drop in today. 

Nice small restaurant with about 10 tables and nice bay window which I sat at. 

Very friendly and attentive servers, and the Sushi Chef  was very nice and greeted you as you entered. 

The menu was simple and easy to read and all of the selections sound great. No photos on the menu (which I always find odd), and it was the regular sushi restaurant items - a couple has some variations.  

Placed my order of a yam and avocado roll and a spider toll. 

The server arrived with nice warm green tea - not scalding like so many places that you can not even hold the cup..... Really tasted nice and warmed me up from the outside cold today. 

Then within a couple  minutes she brings me miso soup and salad which I did not order and was apparently included.....both were great.....then a few minutes later she brings over aged tofu in a sauce.....compliments of the restaurant......very nice of them and it was incredible. 

Then my rolls arrived and they were artfully arranged on the plates in the flare that only the Japanese can do. They looked like little works of art on a white canvas. With the white ginger and little ball of wasabi......both were just wonderful. I will have the yam and avocado again - it was really nice. 

All in all the place is worth many trips back....it's close to home....and I will enjoy trying other items on the menu

{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a high rating. The food was quite bad and the price was not that cheap. The salmon we had was definitely not fresh, the rice was bad and the presentation was terrible. Of course, the chefs are not Japanese. Regret our visit."}
{"text":"Wow sushi was very good. I went here and ordered a couple of plates. I thought the service was excellent, the server was nice, and was patient with our inability to order in Japanese. The food was very very good, and I liked the decor.I really honestly enjoyed eating in this little restaurant. The food seemed very fresh. I was actually very tempted to say \"Omakase gozaimasu\" , but I wasn't sure of myself for some reason. Maybe I should have, though the food was fabulous. I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"A lot of times, I feel like the Chirashi is a good indication of the quality at a sushi restaurant. Chirashi Don is rice with sashimi on top. It's simple and if the fish shines through despite the simplicity, then it's a good indication everything else will be done well. The fish should always be the star at a sushi restaurant. 

Reading Wow's reviews, there was no doubt in my mind that this was what I was getting. \"Piece of art\" was what people referred to it as. For $18, I certainly got a rather avant garde version of Chirashi Don. But it wasn't as beautiful as some of the pictures I saw. The pieces of fish were small, almost like strips, and some were kinda placed messily on the plate. But there was no denying that it was absolutely, 100% delicious. 

Garlic on sushi makes so much sense. \"Ew garlic on raw fish\" - says someone that doesn't know what they're talking about. NO. Sear the top of a butter fish/white tuna/whatever that thing is, put some crispy garlic pieces and then talk to me. It's heavenly.  Cod, salmon, tuna, and that pinkish piece of sashimi. I don't even know what it was. Maybe some kinda tuna? It just needs to get into my mouth. 

And then there's the Japango roll. $12 for 8 pieces of that bad boy: salmon and scallop on top of California roll (which I can unashamedly eat forever). Perfect amount of sauce, perfect amount of sear. Pork katsu was crispy and tasty and somehow even the accompanying steamed veggies were on some sort of next level. 

Wow Sushi has been in my bookmarks since the beginning . While waiting an hour to see the ROM exhibit, I was dreaming of Wow Sushi. While freezing my face off, I was awaiting the reward of Wow Sushi at the end of my trek. So yes, my expectations were high. And luckily for me, they did not disappoint. Would I do all that again? Probably not. But that's because I just found out there's now a location uptown. Woooooooo!

(6/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places in Toronto! 

Came here for dinner with a friend. We were given complimentary miso soup before we even ordered, which was great since it was freezing outside. It's such a simple soup but it was surprisingly really good.. a lot more flavourful than the generic miso soups you get from Japanese restaurants. 

I then ordered the Maki Dinner (spicy salmon roll, tempura roll and alaska roll). The sauce on the spicy salmon didn't look like the traditional spicy mayo sauce that you'd normally expect (it was yellow). It was quite spicy but it didn't overpower the roll itself. You could taste the quality of sashimi. 

The tempura roll, which may seem pretty basic, was also surprisingly good. The tempura was crispy even inside the roll and all the flavours came together really harmoniously. 

The alaska roll was the fanciest roll of the three (california roll with salmon on top) and had various sauces.  Something I also want to comment on is the temperature of these rolls. Some sushi restaurants serve rolls so cold, but these were served around room temperature, which just made things taste more flavourful - almost savoury. 

We also ordered sake called \"Okunomatsu Kinmon\" (the first sake on the list). Although it was a little expensive at $22, this was the BEST sake I've ever had. It went down so smooth, did not feel overly acidic or overpoweringly alcoholic at all, and complimented the sushi really well. 

Really recommend this restaurant and can't wait to explore their lunch options!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The only problem is I am uptown, otherwise, this would be the\"GO-TO\" place for Sushi. I had the Chirashi meal and cost aound $18. For that price tag, I would have set a higher expectation and they did not disappoint me at all. All sashimi were fresh and served at the right temperature (i hate all you can eat places that served frozen sashimi). Some of the fish I don't even recognize (pretty exotic)..  I like how they added some pan-seared Tuna and japanese style grilled fish. I also tried out their Black Cod @ $9 and sushi pizza, both were top notch! I would higherly recommend and go back anytime."}
{"text":"My GF took me here recently, to prove to me that Wow! Sushi is among best sushi in Toronto. I wasn't skeptical per se, but obviously not being a coastal town, I'm simply of the mind that Toronto has a plateau that can't really be topped - certainly there's only so good you can get maintaining tradition while using frozen transported fish. 

Noooope. Wow! Sushi does what all the other generic and supposedly \"upscale\" sushi restos in T.O fail to recognize is essential in setting themselves apart: they employ creativity; Wow! serves up platters that, based on the menu description, contain a standard sushi-place-combo ensemble of fish. Yet on closer inspection, it's clear there's something going on here that you wouldn't find anywhere else.

Highlights of our extremely reasonably priced Sushi/Sashimi combo include rectangular prisms of Sea Bream, roasted-garlic-topped seared tuna, and sea urchin. It was all delicious - the rice perfect, the service excellent, the fish scrumptious - but as I said, what puts this above every other Toronto sushi place is that they offer something different; I appreciate that attempt to be unique, and it's what's going to have me coming back again and again to try everything on the menu. That and the perfect rectangular bream prisms."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Very pleasant, attentive service. Nice portions. Priced fairly. Can't miss"}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch around 2pm. 

It is a tiny place, very close to Yonge and Bloor intersection. This place probably fits 30 people max, sitting very closely together.

There was only one waitress working at the time, and there were 3-4 tables including mine. As soon as I entered, I was seated right away. A small bowl of salad, miso soup, and a cup of water was set on my table almost instantly when I haven't even opened the menu. When I decided what to eat, I had to flag down the waitress to order. That was probably the last time I have seen the waitress until we left the restaurant. We had to get saucers ourselves, water was never refilled, and the waitress didn't provide any napkins. As soon as she dropped down the plates on my table (without saying a word), she went into the back kitchen and never came out.

I ordered their \"sushi lunch\", and it is the only lunch combo that you get nigiri sushi pieces. Considering the location of the resaurant, they have a relatively cheaper price tag when it comes to lunch- 8 pieces of nigiri and 8 pieces of sushi for $13. However it is not THAT much cheaper, and I would rather pay couple bucks more to have higher quality sushi.

Sushi rice was mushy and bland. Fish did not taste fresh at all. The portion is smaller than other sushi lunches I have had at various sushi restaurants in the GTA.

After the meal, we sat around waiting for waitress to show up. When we saw no signs of the waitress, I decided to walk up towards the kitchen. That is when one of the sushi chefs came around the sushi bar to give us a bill. The waitress was still nowhere to be seen.

Overall, I am not too pleased with the quality of food, service, and the ambiance. I will not come back."}
{"text":"Great new place in the neighbourhood.  Came here during opening special and got a discount on the total bill.  Came both times during lunch.  

On one of the days the heat must have not been working, it was really cold inside, but they tried to accommodate by serving us miso soup and salad right when we sat down, so it was nice to have something hot to drink. 

We tried the sashimi lunch, and it came with a wide variety of different sashimi, some torched which added a nice touch.  
We also tried some of the rolls that's on their lunch special, the rolls aren't that special, as the unique ones are not part of lunch and must be ordered a la carte.

We also tried the sashimi don lunch, on the dinner menu it states it's served with rice, vegetables and spicy sauce, but the lunch didn't come with the vegetables or spicy sauce.  It was like a charashi, only difference was the sashimi was cut in cubes.  We thought it would be a Hae due bap, so was a little disappointed when it came.  Both lunch and dinner named the same thing, but served differently. 
Either way the sashimi was really fresh so we still enjoyed it. 

The service was pretty good, attentive.  
I'm glad to have a new sushi place in the neighbourhood. I tried the one downtown before, and was excited they opened one up town. 

Will come back and try their dinner or maybe their take out trays."}
{"text":"The sushi here is the best I have had....EVER!! The place is sooo small and not amazing ambiance but if you go off hours and get the place to yourself, you will have the most amazing experience. The presentation is unbelievable and the taste exquisite. Well done WOW sushi !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with artful preparation and super friendly service. Yes, it's pricier than most of the area sushi shops in the area, and the portions are a little smaller, but the quality can't be beat. Your best bet is the sashimi assortment, which offers the chef's choice of gorgeous piscine delights -- some are seared, some accented with house-made oils, and all beautifully presented. 

The only disappointment I've had here is the philadelphia roll, which probably should be taken off the menu because it just doesn't match the caliber of the rest of the menu. So don't order that. Order the sashimi instead. 

The service is super nice and practically over the top. I want to give the entire staff hugs every time I come in. I try bowing instead, but it just doesn't seem like enough thanks for such a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Try our their 7 course meal for $60 per person! Husband and I went for our anniversary!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch there today following a recommendation from a friend. Was good overall, quiet little spot, would go again."}
{"text":"Small place on Markham road tucked in the corner of a decently multicultural plaza.

Ordered Salmon/Avocado and Spicy Salmon Rolls, Chirasi, two pieces of Uni sushi and Sushi Lunch with my partner. The fish was very fresh as was the uni.

Portions are decent enough to be satisfying without feeling that there's more to be ordered. Service was exceptional and staff was friendly.

The only shortfall is that the restaurant is closed Tuesdays when we originally intended to go. Otherwise it is an excellent spot to enjoy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is the only sushi place I order from and regularity eat at. They have great torched fish and their sushi combo for lunch or dinner is well with the price! Highly recommend for a date or a one on one meet up!"}
{"text":"A very delicious spot in the area!

Given the large amount of sushi restaurants at your disposal around this area, Wow Sushi may be neglected due to it being a rather small and hidden joint.  

When I arrived, the place was bustling, and they were unavailable to accommodate me for about 10 minutes.  As I was about to leave, they were able to find me a spot... and boy am I ever glad I stayed

I ordered the chirashi lunch and spicy salmon roll.  The latter came first, and looked different from any other spicy salmon roll i'd ever eaten: the quality was absolutely amazing! It's hard to find a good quality spicy salmon roll, and this one really shown above the other place I've recently tried.  

Their Chirashi lunch was also fantastic.  They enjoy the blowtorch technique (or at least that's what I assume,) as a few of the white fish I received were cooked on the outside, and raw on the inside.  

In addition, there were some fish I had not tried beforehand, and I wish I could tell you I now know what they are, but due to the busy nature of the restaurant I wasn't able to ask.

The one downside to the visit would probably have been the service.  Now they weren't extremely bad, I am going to lean toward the \"they were extremely busy\" side.  

Overall my experience there was fantastic, definitely the best of the restaurants I've tried in the yonge/wellsley area.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's about time that a great quality sushi place opened up in East Markham! I would say aside from Osaka (which I would only go for their rolls), Markham has been missing what I would call 'mid tier' sushi, and that is good quality sushi at higher than average pricing. But here's the kick, Wow Sushi's pricing is bang for your buck considering the quality you get. This combination of quality and value, earns a five-star from me with no hesitation.

We ordered three special rolls: the Japango, Markham, and Louis rolls. I love the heat levels of these spicy rolls, they're actually spicy for once and have a nice kick to them. The Japango roll featured blowtorched salmon and scallop, combined with sweet and spicy sauces. It was definitely my favourite of the night. The Louis roll is perfect if you like crunchy and spicy! My only minor complaint were that the rolls were on the small side, but maybe that's because we've been used to seeing such ginormous special rolls around these parts.

Next up was the Sushi Sashimi Moriawase which I really enjoyed. There were plenty of types including: Hamachi, BC tuna, sea bream, octopus, squid, sea urchin, etc. Highlights included the eel tempura sushi and torched seabream. The quality of fish was good, quite fresh and is a lot better than what most of Markham has to offer.

With a grand opening discount of 13% off with all those complimentary items, this was amazing! Wow Sushi certainly has the wow factor, it will definitely be my go to sushi place from now on."}
{"text":"Took a break from the Royal Ontario museum for some sushi at Wow Sushi restaurant. The place is small with limited seating. Took advantage of the weekday lunch special for the sushi deluxe, chirashi,  3 maki rolls and chicken katsu. The sushi was ok. The tuna sushi wasn't the usual slice over rice. Instead it was 3 small pieces squished together. It wasn't fresh. The salmon was alright. I didn't know what the other fishes were since those were all seared on top. The spicy salmon rolls were tasty. We ordered the chicken katsu but received pork katsu instead. The waitresses had a difficult time understanding but were attentive. This place is overrated."}
{"text":"Love WOW sushi!  Always the friendliest staff and chefs, and great sushi!  Comparable to BC sushi IMO.  Very small restaurant but the service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Ordered 7 or 8 specialty rolls .. all were great but I like the caterpillar and narudo the best .. service was a bit slow but food made up for it"}
{"text":"You never go wrong with WOW Sushi. Good quality, lots of option, quick delivery and good value for money.

The restaurant itself is nice too, not that big but nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Wow sushi just slightly missed the mark from being a wow! The lunch deals were especially worth their prices, but everything felt a little sloppy for me unfortunately. 

We had their sushi lunch deal (miso soup, salad, 8 sushi and 8 pcs roll). It was plenty of food and definitely worth the money. The rolls were unassuming and did not standout. The sushi had some good pieces but other ones lacked refinement (thin and uneven slices of fish, un trimmed slices of fish)

Overall, I would definitely recommend coming for a cheap lunch but its not the type of place I'd come back over and over again."}
{"text":"Good food and a cozy interior! 

 The food was pretty good, we got the small boat for about $50. The fish all tasted very fresh! Rice was kind of on the warm and soft side. Some pieces of sushi would fall apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks. Their soy sauce has this strange flavor to it that I can't quite explain (in a good way, though).

Service was very fast and attentive. We got salad and miso soup a couple minutes after we sat down.

The inside is VERY small, there's only about 7 or 8 tables, each seating 4 people. I actually don't usually like small spaces or restaurants, but this place was cozy, warm, and peaceful."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in Toronto for sure! Price hasn't changed for the last 7 years, yet the quality is amazing! Will recommend"}
{"text":"Don't think it's as great as everyone makes it seem. Personally think it's overpriced & not that tasty. Spicy salmon roll wasnt even spicy, chopped scallop roll was a piece of scallop with cucumber."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. I had the chirashi platter and it was hands down the best sushi I've had in recent memory. I will be back."}
{"text":"We found Wow Sushi through Yelp and quite impressed with it. They have premium sushi with reasonable prices. Their sushi tastes wonderfully and you don't have to make your wallet cry. Their tempura udon is good and don't recommend it to people who don't like mushrooms because it's mushroom based. Their salmon is delicious and their service is very nice. Highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Ok... This place reminds me a lot of japango because they have almost the same rolls, they even have a japango roll..
However the quality of the sushi it's not as good... The rice is sticky and to be honest I felt the place was overpriced for the quality. The service was good and everybody was friendly."}
{"text":"wonderful super friendly awesome food super affordable i have come here multiple times and i always enjoy myself"}
{"text":"Wow Sushi totally rocked my world.
I don't know what my boyfriend and I were doing around here (I think looking for a theatre). I don't know why we were around here, but when we saw Wow Sushi, we decided to check it out since our friend Bernie goes here.
We absolutely loved it.
The place is small. We were lucky to get seated right away on a Saturday night.  There aren't many tables here. Maybe like 5-7 and a party was taking up two of them.
No sooner had we sat down when diners started appearing at the door.
I had spicy salmon that was so good it made me sad I didn't live in the area. I would get take out from this place any day of the week.
We also shared the Philadelphia roll (cream cheese, avocado, salmon). It was heavenly.
My boyfriend loved his meal as well.
I did feel a little rushed when we were here... more from the people waiting at the door, staring down my food than from the servers (although we felt a little pressure from them too).
The sushi however, was so good that I would definitely want to return."}
{"text":"If it weren't for yelp i think i would still be sticking with Shinobu, aoyama, or zen for my sushi fix in Toronto. I have been here twice-once on saturday and again for dinner today. Both times i ordered the medium sushi platter and was not disappointed. 

The medium platter comes with 32 pieces of sushi rolls and 30 pcs of sushi. The rolls are: dynamite roll, japango, louis, and another roll which i forgot. I asked to switch the japango roll to wow! Sushi roll. I suggest you do the same if you like torched scallop, fish roe, torched salmon, tempura shrimp, and avocado.   

They put fried garlic sticks on top of the butterfish sushi which is to die for. I had hamachi on saturday night but wasn't lucky enough to have it again today. The salmon sushi wasn't as fresh as i had it on saturday night which might be my only qualm with Wow.

Other than that, bring cash to pay and you get a discount. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I like this japanese restaurant a lot. Good location in the east end of Markham and offers good value for the quality of food. Mid range Japanese food. Though quality varies depnding on when you go. Not consistent. But overall its good. Call in take out orders a head of time and its always ready when I arrive. Even includes salad and soup when ordering takeout. No tax if u pay by cash as well! What a bonus."}
{"text":"Amazing fish quality and very nice staff. Definitely one of the best sushi places in the city."}
{"text":"Heard good things about Wow Sushi and wasn't let down. I found it had a lot of different things to choose on the menu and the price wasn't all that bad just a little more then then the average sushi place.

My favorites were butter fish, eel, spicy salmon and squid sushi.

Not much seating so glad we came on a quiet night."}
{"text":"This place is so overrated!! The food is mediocre at best and the service was awful. Out of all of the amazing sushi spots in Toronto, don't chose to go here and be ridiculously underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Came in late one night expecting a run of the mill sushi place - it's small but decently arranged, though can imagine seating could get scarce at busier times.  

Got the small susi boat to go (they were closing soon) and was pleasantly surprised.  Although a little pricey at $45ish, they actually lightly sear the fish and that gives it a very unique flavour worth coming in for.  

Miso soup was standard fare, was surprised there was none of the wonderful orange-dressing salad, but the soy sauce in individual dipping-friendly containers was a nice touch.  

Would definitely consider here again if in the area."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was not. They weren't rude but they definitely did not make us feel welcome! They brought the check without us even asking for it (and it wasn't that there were people waiting for a table or anything!); and no one even asked us if we wanted to have desert!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered the sushi lunch special for myself and a Costco roll to share (I ordered this roll just for the name. I like Costco). 

SUSHI LUNCH SPECIAL ($12) 
This lunch special included a miso soup and salad. I normally don't drink miso soup so I can't comment on it but the salad was really good! I really enjoyed it. 
The sushi lunch consisted of a spicy salmon roll (8 pieces) and 8 pieces of assorted sushi. The spicy salmon roll wasn't that spicy but was still good. I would order this again. 

COSTCO ROLL ($12) 
This roll consists of eel tempura, shrimp, and avocado. I liked this roll but it didn't wow me. I don't think I would order it again since it is rather pricy compared to what you can get in the lunch specials. 

In terms of the restaurant itself, the place is on the smaller side. There were 2 tables that seated 6, 3 tables that seated 4, and 2 tables that seats 2. Not that well suited for large groups. 

You get a discount if you pay in cash here. I paid in cash and didn't have to pay the tax on my meal.

I would come back here for lunch.

(Random side note: I really like the tea they serve here)"}
{"text":"I really like the sushi platter I ordered before. A bit expensive, but the food satisfies my taste buds."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place quite frequently since their grand opening because it was down the street from me and a decent place.

They have since changed.  We always order The same thing and have noticed that he portions have gotten significantly smaller..

 the tuna and avocado tartar used to be plated on a long plate and had lots of tuna and avocado. Now it's in a giant circular plate with very little tuna. The chirashi dinner used to be a square plate with full pieces of sashimi and some sea urchin and a big triangle of rice. Now there is no urchin, the sashimi is half sized and the rice is barely a handful.

They seem to have pulled out the big portions for their grand opening weeks, to drum up business and now they have scaled back to keep costs down.

Generally not a good sign. Especially if the bill is over $50 and you walk away hungry.

I will not be back. I feel ripped off and I hate that feeling. Value and consistency are important. I can go elsewhere and get better value."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Soft shell crab was delicious in the roll. Great portion sizes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first meal at Wow Sushi and I look forward to going back!
My husband and I shared a variety of dishes - Agedashi Tofu, Yakinasu, Spicy Tuna Roll, Dynamite Roll, Unagi Roll(I'm allergic to avocado, so we omitted that), and a Cucumber Roll. The tofu and the eggplant dishes both came garnished with bonito flakes, which complimented them quite nicely. I have had grilled eggplant before that was quite sweet and oily, which was not the case here. I left feeling full but not like I had done something I regretted haha. 
The rolls are on the smaller side, but not overly expensive, so we tacked the Unagi on at the end and that rounded out our meal perfectly - it was absolutely delish!
Although there is limited seating, the service was friendly and our food came quite quickly - there were a few other tables and a pretty constant stream of people coming for takeout and delivery pickup. We paid about $38 before tip for what we ordered and didn't walk away feeling like we paid too much. We would absolutely eat at Wow Sushi again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I happened to be in the area; I was so elated to catch Wow! Sushi in it's opening week. 

We were here to experience:
- Eating at a \"Hot and New\" restaurant in Canada
- Having torched sushi (beware the plate is HOT)
- Watching animated bonito flakes wave around from the heat coming off the food.

Restaurant is small and bright. The waitress was polite,  pleasant and attentive. She greeted us at the door, sat us at a table by the window and immediately served us complimentary miso soup and piping hot green tea made with toasted or roasted rice. The chef came to our table to serve us our complimentary appetizer of deep fried tofu with katsuo-bushi (bonito flakes); watching the flakes dance definitely kept me entertained!

We ordered the calamari appetizer that came with a small side of mayo sprinkled with spices, the Japango roll (a spicy California roll with salmon and a scallop on top) and the Salmon Teriyaki Lunch which came with a small bowl of white rice.

Everything was tasty but my favorite was the deep fried tofu (deliciously soft and not spongy) and the Japango roll (tender scallop with a nice tingle of spice). The flavor of the miso soup was a little too strong for my taste, the salmon and steamed veggie side was a little overcooked and the calamari was more chewy than I like (hubby actually prefers it this way). So overall I would rate it a solid 3.5 stars, rounded up for the hospitality of the staff."}
{"text":"Not sure what got into me, but I had a sushi craving all week, yesterday at Hub and today at WOW-sushi.  Based on the reviews this was among one of the best places for sushi in Toronto.  Thankfully this was a short hop from the subway as my sushi hunger grew on me. 
Firstly the place is easy to miss due to the size of the place, and all the crazy signage plastered near Yonge and Charles.  HOwever WOW is amazingly clean, and small (approx. 8-10 tables) Our server was very efficient as were the sushi chefs.  Overall layout of this place is open concept with the sushi bar in the center, fixtures are Japanese themed, and generally I felt pretty cozy. 

Their menu, and choices are perfectly selected, and if you're looking for meat, they only carry chicken, as I skimmed through their menu. 
We ordered their Japango Roll, Spicy Sushi, Philadelphia, Salmon Avocado sushi and vegetable tempura...... Out of all the Japango was by far their specialty and it was totally delish with the lightly torched salmon to top off the dish! Presentation was superb, and taste factor was present! 

My only recommendation is to make reservations due to the size of the restaurant, as well to add a few more meat items...kobe beef??"}
{"text":"I've got to Wow Sushi is a great addition to this plaza that's lacking some Japanese flare.
Recently opened we decided to stop by to end our sushi crave.
The layout of the restaurant is great, clean and most of all, clean.
Wow has a great selection of specialty rolls, two of which we tried; Costco lol..and their Japango.  If you're here for lunch, they've also got set menus that run from 11-3:30 daily.

Japango - in terms of specialty this is usually our go-to dish, beautifully presented. 

Costco was good, but it seemed similar to a California roll.

Great place overall"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite sushi spots in Toronto. The fish is so fresh and though I don't live that near anymore, they are a go-to for delivery. I usually order the small boat with a friend and we can never finish all the sushi in one sitting. 

The restaurant is tiny so be prepared to crammed. 

I have yet to have a bad experience at Wow Sushi."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi was a surprising find for delicious sushi. We picked up a medium boat for a work party and the taste was a magnitude better than the 6 other sushi platters we ordered from various other sushi joints.

The sushi options were well varied especially when the total came out to $68 dollars for 62 pieces (30 pc. sushi and 32 pc. maki) which is an amazing value for a downtown establishment (In comparison, Japango, another popular sushi joint was around the same price for 33 pieces). 

It stacks up well against some of the more expensive, popular places in town as well such as Miku and JaBistro with its unique flavours. To keep things interesting, some pieces were cooked \"aburi\" style and others seared lightly at the edges which added depth to the flavour profile of the platter. After such a wonderful sampling I would definitely say that this is one of my new favourite places for sushi!

Come here if you want premium tasting sushi without the premium prices."}
{"text":"I have no other words than: amazing sashimi! The pieces were so delicate and every bite melted in my mouth. Wow.
Other than that I would say that they have low prices for pretty much everything. 

Staff was friendly and helpful, they even returned my mothers cellphone which she had forgot in the downstairs bathroom. 

Lovely atmosphere and the best sashimi I've ever had. Would have ordered the sashimi dinner if I get the opportunity to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location a couple times and got excited when I heard this location popped up 10 minutes away from me. I came at around 11:45am on a Sunday and it was quite empty, there was only one other table occupied.

I got the chirashi lunch special (comes with miso soup and salad) and my boyfriend got the curry katsu. The pieces of sashimi were fresh and very buttery - I really liked the torched salmon since it brought out some nice smokey flavours. I was still a bit hungry (Normally the portions would be fine but I had an intense workout so I was about 3/4 full) so we ordered a japango roll. It was as good as I remembered it to be at the downtown location so I'm glad it's close to me now.

The value is great for the quality of fish you get - chirashi was about $13 and the curry katsu was $10. I would absolutely be back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Second time at Wow Sushi today, and loved it again! For the price point this sushi restaurant is a definite 5/5. I find it to be similar to Japango but more reasonably priced. Both times I have had the sashimi dinner (DELICIOUS) and the Japango roll, which I highly recommend. I also tried the Caterpillar Roll and Wow Roll today, which were good but not mind-blowing. The miso soup was surprisingly good. The place is tiny, so call ahead if you have a large group. For take-out or a casual sushi dinner I would absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came to Wow sushi as part of the Yelp UYE. Wow sushi is a pretty tiny restaurant with around 6-7 tables of 2 people each. As soon as I entered I was extremely warmly greeted by the chefs behind the sushi bar.  Coming in from a bleary and wet outdoors, this set a relaxing tone for the rest of the dinner. 

Our table immediately got two large bowls of complimentary edamame. No agedashi tofu, unfortunately but I`m not complaining. Everyone received miso soup and salad. When taking our order the waitress immediately asked if we`d like separate bills (+1 star for being unusually courteous). More restaurants should take a page from Wow`s level of service. 

I wasn`t famished that night so I opted for rolls instead of a main dish, but as it turns out, the special rolls are huge. The top four special rolls require a bit of a description, so I prompted our server for a run-down and decided on the Louis Maki - Scallop, topped with spicy salmon and tempura shrimp as well as the Spicy Salmon Maki. 
The Louis Maki was delicious, and extremely attractively decorated but it was huge and very filling, after that the Spicy Salmon Maki was a little average-looking and paled very slightly in comparison to the Louis Maki. 

I will be back the next time I`m craving sushi, which is pretty much always."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sashimi dinner at Wow Sushi and had a SEVERE CASE OF FOOD POISONING the same night - I felt nauseous and was vomiting the whole night. The next day, I even caught a fever and was sick for most of the day.

I've been to Wow Sushi a few times prior to this and the sashimi is generally quite fresh but at times I find certain types of sashimi to be a little fishy. I think this time it was the oyster that was part of the Sashimi dinner that caused my food poisoning. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS PLACE as the freshness of their sashimi is so inconsistent."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best sushi I've had in Toronto. The quality is excellent. The downfall is that the place is too small. It can compare to 5 star dining. I ordered the chirashi dinner and sushi pizza. They were delicious."}
{"text":"I didn't know trying to find a Japanese place that had good rating on a holiday.and downtown was this hard...ended up @ Wow Sushi after searching for a little bit... 

First impression was it was small, we were sat down at a table with a toddler and immediately the server gave the toddler a small bottle of juice to quiet down..thats a plus.. +0.5 star.. 

Before even ordering,  we were offered a small appetizer on the house...Which definitely impressed a first -timer here... meee... =)

We ordered a small boat, tempura, black cod, uni..
Small boat came up set by set instead of one boat which felt smaller than big boat coming all at once.. 

I liked the presentation of the food, the sizes were slightly smaller in comparison with other sushi places.. 

The rice and salmon ratio on sushi was another +.5 as I find alot of places nowadays have way too much rice ratio... 

Everything felt right, tasted good... I'm happy!"}
{"text":"This sushi is great to have when your having friends over for dinner. Good prices and lots of different things to order. I order the party trays and they are great!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is so great! The staff is very kind and attentive and the restaurant is very intimate. The food is exceptional and high quality. Portions might be small but you go for the quality and presentation. I tried this restaurant on a whim and was so pleasantly surprised. I will become a regular here because I really believe in their business. Ps my server drew on my take out boxes, kawaii!"}
{"text":"Great service and fresh sushi!  We received complimentary agedashi tofu just after being seated for a few minutes. The food came out quickly, except for my brother's dish. Because he was still waiting while the rest of us were eating, they gave him a complimentary hand roll. This place is very small so don't plans large dinner party. It more for an intimate lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi doesn't have the most creative name, but it does invoke thoughts of \"wow, this is really great sushi!\"

A tiny restaurant with only a handful of tables, Wow Sushi is just south of the Bay & Bloor intersection. If you drive, you'll need to pay for parking at one of the local lots.

Their raw fish is above average in quality, think Aoyama quality where all their raw fish melts in your mouth. Everything here, from food quality to japanese staff to decor, screams authenticity.

I can't wait to return to Wow Sushi!"}
{"text":"After dining at the downtown location of Wow Sushi, I had to try their Markham location. I actually enjoyed the food here more.

We ordered agedashi tofu (was alright), sushi moriwase (chef's combination of nigiri and sashimi, was very good), karaage (fried chicken, was also tasty and fairly priced), and Japango roll (felt it was of much better quality here compared to the downtown Wow Sushi.

To put it into perspective, their raw fish grade is higher than average, but lower than that of Zen / Aoyama / JaBistro. It's great for when you want to eat a little more upscale but won't break the bank. 

A couple of noticeable differences, however. The Markham WOW employees were all speaking Mandarin, whereas the downtown WOW all spoke Japanese. Also, the service was a bit slow in Markham despite the restaurant not being busy at the time.

They're located in a plaza with plenty of free parking.

All in all, I highly recommend WOW sushi."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi is a small, sit-down restaurant located near Young and Bloor.  The restaurant is not accessible, as there are stairs to enter the restaurant and to access the bathroom.  The bathrooms are gendered.  The menu is not very vegetarian/vegan friendly.  

The restaurant has around 8-10 tables, however they are very close together.  If you need your space in a restaurant or are hoping for an intimate setting, I would recommend getting take-out.  

My friend and I were seated quickly in the packed restaurant.  We immediately received complimentary miso soup and tea, which was a nice touch.  The menu offers standard, Canadian sushi, donburi bowls and cooked dishes.  

My friend is vegetarian, which isn't normally an issue when getting sushi.  We have had success asking to substitute fish with other ingredients such as avocado, tempura, spicy sauce or other ingredients.  However, we had difficulty communicating with the waitress.  We ended up ordering edamame, agedashi tofu, tempura rolls, yam and avocado rolls and Philadelphia rolls with no fish.

The edamame was a little over-cooked, but still good.  The agedashi tofu was a bit on the soft side and COVERED in bonito, or fish flakes.  It seemed a little odd that one of the only vegetarian dishes was covered in fish.  None the less, everything was good.  We then received the Philadelphia rolls and tempura rolls.  Despite trying to explain that we did not want any fish in that Philadelphia roll, it came with fish.  But our very sweet server took them back and replaced them.

I would have normally given the place 3 out of 5 stars had the rolls not been so amazing.  I've eaten and even worked at sushi places and was blown away. I'd ideally like to return when it's not totally packed or for take out.  I may also have to accept that you can't order much vegetarian food here."}
{"text":"Came here on the week of opening of the restaurant. Was only one here for dinner. Sushi was definitely really delicious. 

It's great that there is another sushi restaurant in Markham that I can go to. Prices are actually very decent considering the quality of fish provided and how you can also get blowtorch Sushi as well.

Got 13% off on the bill since it was a grand opening special and also got complimentary tofu edamame and ice cream.

I would definitely come back to try their lunch specials!!!"}
{"text":"Im giving out my 1st 1-star review because their dumplings are definitely the worst ones i have had so far in my life. 

I ordered pork & cabbage dumplings. It tastes nasty. the stuff tastes like 2 day old boiled lettice. The only reason i finished them was because they are about  5 times expensive as the frozen machine-made dumplings i can get from grocery stores.

And their spicy-and-sour soup is absolutely a joke. Its made from imitation crab, shrimp, egg drops and plain water with few drops of hot sauce."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant in Toronto (both for dine in and delivery). The chefs and servers have never been anything buy nice to me, and the food is always fresh and perfectly prepared.

My usual is the sashimi dinner, which is 18 pieces of sashimi usually a mix of tuna, salmon, hamachi (seared topped with fried garlic), butter fish (blowtorched), scallop, and mackeral (blowtorched). it will also come with an extra piece of uni and sweet shrimp to make it 20 pieces in total.  the mix of fresh salmon and tuna, with the smokiness of the torched butterfish and hamachi makes for a great plate of sashimi.

In addition to the sashimi, they also make some great maki rolls. They're not that big, especially given the price but they're good. My favourite rolls are the Japango Roll , and the spicy scallop roll.

They don't give descriptions of what's in the special rolls, so here's a brief rundown in case you're interested.  

Global Leslie Roll: spicy tuna, snapper and cucumber roll, topped with unagi and avocado, and drizzled with teriyaki sauce

Wow Special Maki: Dynamite Roll topped with shrimp and avacado

Japango Roll: California roll topped with cooked salmon, scallop, and fish roe.

On occasion when dining in, they've given me a complementary tofu appetizer, and/or ice cream for dessert. The black sesame ice cream is awesome."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 star rating. I came here for lunch with a friend on Saturday as we were in the mood for sushi. The restaurant is very small but decorated well. We were welcomed immediately and brought to one of the few remaining tables. As soon as we sat down we were given complimentary green tea, salad, and miso soup. We had not even opened the menus yet! So far they were starting off very well.

I ordered the shrimp sashimi ($8 - four pieces) and the cucumber roll ($3 - eight pieces). After ordering, we enjoyed our appetizers and both commented on how much we like our salads. Although it was the standard iceberg lettuce that you tend to get at Japanese restaurants, the dressing was different and was really good! Neither of us had the miso soup as we just do not enjoy it in general. 

Our main dishes arrived quickly and we both commented on the size of the rolls - we were not expecting to receive eight pieces - and eight pieces that were stuffed well with a good rice to filling ratio! I like that they brought all four of our dishes at the same time (my friend's two rolls and my sashimi and cucumber roll); however, it was a bit odd that they split up our two orders and put one if each of our orders on two different plates. As in my shrimp was plated with one of my friend's rolls and my cucumber roll was plated with her other roll. My shrimp sashimi was very fresh and were good sized pieces. 

The service was also very good and the wait staff were pleasant. WOW Sushi loses half of a star because I thought that $8 for four pieces of shrimp sashimi was a bit steep. They do have lunch specials, so the prices may not be as bad if you order one of those.

All in all this was a good experience and I will return. I would recommend WOW Sushi if you are looking for a quiet place for lunch in Yorkville where you will get good quality food and not pay astronomical prices."}
{"text":"Before starting a lovely Saturday afternoon filled with shopping, I decided to fuel up with sushi! Being in the neighbourhood, I headed to Wow! Sushi. I ordered the Maki Lunch, with consisted of California roll, tempura roll, spicy tuna roll & spicy salmon roll (a total of ~16 pieces). This came along with the customary miso soup and salad. The rolls were well prepared and perfect mouth size, which is the O shape.

Service was fantastic. As soon as I sat down, green tea was served. This is impressive because I usually have to ask for tea when they bring the menu. Once I placed the order, the master preparing the sushi brought it over."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I took my little sister here last week to celebrate her birthday since its close to U of T and we ordered the omakase, soft shell crab app, toro, and a roll that had seared tuna and scallop. It was amazing although the toro sashimi was expensive ($20/4pieces). The service was also outstanding. I mentioned that it was my sisters birthday and they came with 3 scoops of green tea ice cream with a candle and the waitress sang for us, adorable.

The bill came to $90 for 3 ppl and it was worth every penny. Without the toro it would've been a steal at $65"}
{"text":"Saw that the review was good here so came for lunch to try it out. We ordered the salmon teriyaki lunch, sushi lunch and sashimi lunch. The salmon and sauce was very good. The assortment of sashimi was pretty nice, taste wise it was normal as compared to other places. The sushi, however, was quite disappointing. The rice was packed very loosely so it would fall apart once you try to pick it up. Overall food wise, it's average but the service is very good."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi is just that. It's an incredible little Sushi Place off Charles and Yonge. It's pretty small so if you're expecting to come by, be careful with larger groups. The menu has all your sushi favorites, but also includes some Japanese dishes like udon, karaage, and teriyaki dishes.

Terrible name in my opinion, but you can't say that about their food. As soon as you sit down, they bring you a bowl of miso soup and ginger salad. We had the sushi dinner and the Chef's Choice. The dishes were very similar, but we had quite a bit of selection. The sushi dinner came with a mix of sushi favorites like salmon, tuna, mackerel and others as well. I will be completely honest in that there were sushi pieces that I didn't quite know what they were. They come 2 pieces &nbsp;so a sushi dinner can actually be shared as well if you so choose. The sushi dinner also comes with a shrimp tempura roll just in case you weren't going to be full enough.

The Chef's choice was a nice mix of sashimi and sushi. There was salmon, tuna, uni, and sweet shrimp sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and the pieces had nice subtle flavor without being fishy at all. There were cooked fish sushi which I loved and some that were slightly seared. The uni and salmon were my favorites as they were thick and just plain good.

Loved the sushi and the service wasn't so bad. Prices are pretty good for dinner, but I hear it's way better for lunch so I will have to make it a point to come sometime. This is a nice little place for a date as well as the restaurant is small and intimate. With food this good though, I don't really care who I come with."}
{"text":"Wow this place was incredible. Very authentic and cozy feel inside the restaurant as there were only 5-6 tables. The food itself was fantastic. Small menu selection made choosing easier in my opinion- the chirashi dinner that I had was awesome."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience. salmon was  not fresh. The waiter changed the plate but still the same taste. I honestly regret paying for my meal in the resturant"}
{"text":"Read the Yelp reviews and thought I'd give it a try, since it has been very highly rated.  
Walking up the stairs of what looks to be a converted house, this small place seems like an ideal little sushi shop.

I was immediately greeted and motioned to a table.  There are only 5 tables for 4 and then 2 tables for 2.  So luckily it wasn't that busy.  I sat down was immediately given a hot cup of tea, and a bowl of miso.  Nice start.  I decided to order the Louis Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, and a California Roll.  All were served in record time.  I've seriously never had sushi come out that fast.  The rolls were definitely very good, although the seemed a bit thin.  I get, I didn't order a futomaki, but still, a bit on the small side.  

The only downside of this quaint sushi place is the incredible lackluster performance of the wait staff.  The two gals working in there didn't smile, weren't friendly, never refilled the tea, never offered up water, or really had anything else to do with you once you placed the order.  I think the gal tried to smile when giving me my bill but her heart wasn't in it, and it was pretty obvious.

Overall the quality of the food was good and the sushi chefs seemed to be enjoying themselves, but the rest of the staff seeming like they had been beaten into submission.  No Joy there.
Was going to offer up a solid 4 stars, but sorry, the staff and service just doesn't warrant it."}
{"text":"Tried their bento box for lunch. The food and service were although a bit pricey. Will definitely going back again since it's near where I'm staying."}
{"text":"Slow service, unorganized staff and mediocre sushi. 

Decided to give this place a try, arrived here on a Sunday around noon to a empty restaurant. I ordered the chirashi lunch, girlfriend ordered the two rolls special. Girlfriend's order arrived as more customers started to come in. After 30 minutes of waiting for the chirashi, we noticed the other tables were getting their orders ahead of ours. When we asked what was taking so long, the waiter explained that they were short staffed in the kitchen. When we noted that other tables were getting their orders of nigiri and maki, he said the kitchen ran out of rice... (how does a sushi restaurant run out of rice during a weekend lunch service?!) We asked wouldn't it have been smarter to finish one table's order before starting another? He replied that it was easier for the sushi chef to make nigir and maki than a chirashi. When the chirashi finally arrived, it was very underwhelming. A plate of rice with some sashimi slices on the side.  

Plenty of better sushi options in the area, would not be returning here."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi for such an unassuming place. Probably the best place in the area for Sushi. The staff are nice and friendly too. The sushi lunch at 12$ has a great mix of fish and is a really good deal."}
{"text":"WOW, Service!

We came here tonight and it was my first time.  The place is really small, they've converted a house into a restaurant.  Don't look up the stairs cause when we were there, the stairway to go usptairs (whatever is up there) was dark...I think I'm getting scared....

Anyways, there was a small group ahead of us and I went in just to ask what the wait was.  They said it was a ten minute wait, so we figured ok let's wait.  In the meantime the group that was there left.  We went out to look at pictures of food by the door and I think they thoguht we were leaving, kept telling us \"it's almost ready\"

I personally don't like eating in cramped spaces but I was hungry and the food looked ok (I admit that I only eat Salmon, not a fan of the other fish).  Some of the sushi is placed onto a nest, looks cool but is the nest washed or thrown away? Hmmm

we had the small boat (24 pieces) and the katsu donburi.  I didn't like the donburi it was ok I guess.  The boat came with 8 japango roles, spicy salmon .... mmmmm

The owner there is really friendly and the people there seem good.

If you've seen my other reviews, this one is no exception.  Make sure you bring lots of money here.  They take VIsa, don't think they take AMEX or MC but cash is good.

If your eating alone, be prepared to spend $30.  Take a friend here?  Don't even think you can get away with less than $65+ tip.  And if you want to be full when you leave here, expect to spend $100 for two.  I'm serious....this place ain't cheap !"}
{"text":"The rolls are to die for!! I ordered the Japango Roll which is a California roll topped with scallop and salmon, drizzled which a delicious sauce. The sashimi don is good as well, offering salmon, sea bream, shrimp and tuna. 

Their lunch prices are great value and the food comes fast too. All patrons receive a soup and salad when they arrive as well."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious : one of my favourite places for sashimi/ good quality sushi in Toronto - their butter fish and salmon is great!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is good, it's true. But being made to feel as if I'm in the way of all the take-out money pouring thru the door? No food is THAT good. There are just too many very competent joints in town to put up with attitude. 

Notes:
1. Was reseated twice to accommodate larger parties. 
2.  My order was incorrect. The solution, to sarcastically pinch uni in chopsticks and offer it over the bar. Ever been offered sea urchin on a stick? If there's one food that requires presentation, this is it. (I offered an empty plate as a middle ground, btw. Didn't help.)
3. My sake order was effed up. Re-delivered, it burned my tongue. *sigh*
4. Miso soup was nowhere to be seen despite the reviews. I can live with that. 
5. The kicker was the $30 price tag for the thumbnail-sized portions. Thumb. Nail. 

So, sadly, this diner will decidedly not be back which is too bad because there were some tasty items to be had. I won't be the one to encourage greedy indifference though so sorry folks, find another sucker."}
{"text":"I just ordered in. Asked for no raw fish eggs on all rolls and added a note to each roll I ordered. Guess what! Covered in fish eggs. Quality of actual sushi was not good, messy all around. Barely any soy sauce. Half a small container for 2 rolls.

Also the photo below are rolls I haven't touched. They showed up like that! What a mess."}
{"text":"Came here since I was craving some sushi. Ambience is typical of japanese restaurants - dark wooden chairs, tables, open view of kitchen.

Got the small sushi boat. Came out pretty quick. It was decent, not outstanding, but above AYCE quality. Good selection of items. I found the Japango roll actually didn't taste as good as the one at Japango (possibly overcooked/seared) although I heard it's the same owner. In general, I would say there's not as much finesse in the sushi (e.g. uneven/unproportionally sized pieces) compared to Japango. The service was great though but I was seated right by the kitchen.

Worth trying if you're in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Very decent sushi right in downtown.  The venue is a bit cramped, but that gives it a special vibe.  The ingredients are fresh and that's most important for sushi - you can taste the freshness.  The portions are medium sized and good value for the price. We went there right after a day at the ROM and were famished.  Sushi and light beer make a great combination :)"}
{"text":"Underwhelming (un·der·whelm) - fail to impress or make a positive impact on (someone); disappoint; Wow Sushi.

Wow Sushi fails to impress or really distinguish itself amongst the rest. If you want sushi, you are honestly better off going to somewhere for AYCE, and will get more and at least the same quality or better sushi. I've also been to the Wow Sushi on Yonge/Bloor and felt it was underwhelming and the one in Markham is no different. 

Food 2.5/5 - I ordered the Tori Karaage (fried chicken) and Sashimi Lunch, and I can honestly say that I have had better Japanese food/sushi from half of the AYCE places I have been to. The Tori Karaage was very little, and the taste was average. The Sashimi Lunch, came with a very small bed of rice, salad, miso soup, and 2x each of salmon, white tuna, mackarel, octopus, imitation crab meat, striped bass, and some other mystery fish that was similar in looks to mackarel but softer and not nearly as fishy. Everything tasted average, or subpar compared to other Japanese places I have been to. The White Tuna in particular was seared and in fact I think that made it worse than if it were just raw. 

Service N/A - I ordered take out, but if i were to gauge from my interactions with the waiter, I would probably say a 3/5 or 4/5 at most.

Price 2.5/5 - All of what i paid for was $20, the only thing keeping the price from being a 2/5 is the fact that they offered a 13% of cash discount (I wonder where they got such a specific number... not that I'm complaining). I mean honestly with that price I could have gotten a way better meal going to an AYCE place for lunch, and it would be cheaper too. Considering that what I ordered, Sashimi Lunch, was the most expensive think on the lunch specials menu, and it came with that little, I wouldn't expect the other items to be much better."}
{"text":"Just ate here and it's incredible. Everything you want: fast service, friendly atmosphere, VERY reasonable prices and high quality, high flavour sushi!

We came here after seeing the Yelp review and were not disappointed. We ordered the agedashi tofu, spicy salmon, yam avocado and eel avocado rolls. All superb. 

The place is very small but it adds to it's friendly atmosphere. Even the water with lemon is extra delicious here!

Love it."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi is very good sushi. Here are some takeaways from my visit.

1. The front entrance is about 4-5 wooden steps with no visible access for patrons with limited mobility.
2. Service is commensurate with other better sushi places- not amazing , but good.
3. Prices are higher than many places. While the sushi really tastes fresh, expect to pay 15-20$ after tax and tip to eat lunch here. Definitely a higher price point than general fast food meals.
4. The salad that comes with the meal is fresh, but basic iceberg lettuce. The soup is excellent.
5. The sushi and rolls are excellent. The veggies in each roll are super fresh and crisp.
6. Seating inside is ample, mostly four tops. There is no individual bar seating or large table seating.

If you like sushi and want to spend all-you-can-eat prices on a large enough plate of sushi that is very fresh, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Update November 28, 2017
Came back here and things have definitely changed. The wasabi is now made from powder and it was very unlike them to serve surf clam as a piece of sashimi. We ordered a japango roll and it never came so we had to cancel as we were already finished our main course. Good news is if you pay cash it's still tax free. Wasn't a great experience that the waitress was mopping the place as we ate.

--------------------------------------

So it's New Years Eve, and we have a fridge full of holiday leftovers, yet we decided we wanted to end the year by going out for one last lunch! Restaurants uptown haven't really caught my attention lately so I was scrummaging through Yelp for hopefully something new. 

I was so excited to come across WOW sushi, I had to do a double take at first as I'm a huge fan of their downtown location! The great thing about this location is that the prices are cheaper than the downtown location and, they have a 13% grand opening discount!

We started with a WOW roll - which is a tempera shrimp roll topped with salmon, Scallop and fish eggs all seared with their house sauce. It was delicious!! $12! 

We each ordered the sushi lunch which was also $12 for 8 pieces sushi and a spicy salmon/tuna roll. What a steal. The fish was very fresh and unique! Our favourite was the seared tuna topped with Garlic oil! 

What an extremely satisfying way to end 2016, nothing better than finding one of your favourite restaurants expanding uptown!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I have worked in the area for 5 years plus and we have finally decided to try out Wow Sushi.  The reviews on yelp seemed very positive so I felt we couldn't go wrong here.  Prices were a bit expensive, the place was small yet cozy and the customer service was okay.  I ordered the Chirashi.  It was a bit pricy for lunch ($13), and I knew other places in the area had this for $10 (lunch special).  Overall, food tasted alright but we weren't that 'wowed'."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality sushi over quantity, then this place is for you.  We had the chicken and salmon teriyaki for lunch, plus japango roll.  The staff here are nice and I would definitely come back in the future.  I work near the downtown Toronto location so it's also nice to see a Markham location as well!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday evening with two friends. The place is very tiny, and we were sort of brushed off when we went in to tell them that we needed a table of 3. It was a little awkward.

We were seated after 10 minutes or so. We ordered the medium (or ... the \"mediun\" according to the menu) boat - mainly because we knew there were going to be sushi, and some maki rolls (including the Wow sushi roll, Louis sushi roll, and two other sushi rolls, which one was spicy). I have to admit, this was the best sushi that I've had in Toronto.

Yup. That's right. I said it. The best. Every thing tasted really fresh! Can't believe I went to this place during my last few weeks in Toronto! Hopefully I will be there again in the near future."}
{"text":"I use to order take out from here a lot and it was good. Yesterday we decided to sit in and order food. The food was still great, but the service was really creepy. I am giving it 3 stars because the waitress was literally standing behind us the entire time while we ate and stared at us for our entire meal and picked up each plate as we put the last bit of sushi into our mouth. We sat around with our group and chatted for a bit, because it was a Friday night after all and there were still people eating in the restaurant. She took the menus from the table next to us and smacked them really hard on the table as she was putting stuff away - obviously our cue to leave!

I definitely recommend the food. That server, not so much."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this quaint little place. I went twice the same week!

Here is what I had and what I thought:
- Yellow tail sashimi : super fresh 5/5
- Butter fish sashimi: great, but can't be really done wrong (5/5)
-  louis roll: AMAZING 5/5
- agedashi tofu: comfort on a plate 5/5
- yam & avocado maki: nothing special 3/5
- caterpillar roll: delish 4/5
- ginger icecream: my secret love 5/5

They are very friendly, the food is good, what more do you want?

We ate well, had drinks and the bill was under $60 ( tip not incl.)"}
{"text":"Sushi dinner and sashimi dinner were both amazing! Good quality fish and great variety. The place is very small and a bit cramped, but the service is great!"}
{"text":"Im not sure why this place is getting such high reviews. The food is solid but mostly average. I tried the recommended rolls and yes while being good, it wasnt WOW as the name implies. I found it very small and cramped inside. Old decor. Service was solid but again not WOW. This review reflects 3.5 stars. I wouldnt come again since it was such an average experience."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me. It is a tiny restaurant that I never noticed until a friend told me about their fresh sashimi, and this friend of mine really knows her fish. 

Their rolls are delicious and I love that they are willing to substitute things for me without any extra charge. I am allergic to shellfish and they replace shrimp or crab for salmon. I like their tuna & avocado tartare and their Leslie roll. 

I noticed that the sushi chefs are very skilled and they are not just some guys they hired to make rolls like so many other places in Toronto. 

The small staff is friendly and they will give you discount if you pay in cash.

Awesome find!"}
{"text":"Might actually be the best sushi I've ever had. They serve you green tea, soup, and salad right away. 

I'd definitely recommend the Chirashi (or sashimi) lunch. Not only is the food delicious, the presentation is on point. 

I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"We checked out this sushi spot for lunch. I would probably give a 2.5 if possible. 

It's close to Yonge / Bloor and easy to get to. 
We had the Sushi dinner and Tempura dinner with edamame to start. 

Pros -
Generous portions - decent value. 
Food served promptly and hot. 
Sushi was fresh 
Owner pitched in when it got busy. 
Salad and soup and water was brought over right away. 

Cons - 
Small place. Tables are close. The table next to us at one point was having a rather gruesome conversation - geez people - you are in public and eating!  Please keep that for home.  
I don't remember getting offered a luncheon size which I would have opted for.  Didn't realize until the table next to us did.  :(.   
Also - the tempura dinner had almost exclusively sweet potato tempura for the veg (mine had only 1 piece of broccoli and rest all sweet potato) which was not great especially when I saw the table next to us got a great variety on their tempura plate.
Service was prompt but indifferent. The waitress could have been more forthcoming"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have heard and tried the place.  The staff was friendly and the environment was cozy. It's not a huge place, so if you are going with a group I would definitely recommend you calling ahead to make a reservation.  I went with a group of people and they got pretty busy near the end of the day which resulted in us waiting for our food for over an hour.  The server, apologized for the long wait and offered us edanames and ice cream dessert on the house. There aren't a lot of food choices but the proportions were decent."}
{"text":"I love this place for some quick sushi.

 it's cozy and simple, the staff are very kind and attentive and the food is tasty. good quality and fresh food, I never feel too full or like I ate something super heavy after. 
prices are appropriate for the quality; not too high.

I'd recommend coming here on a casual night to have some sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"Went for dinner but would definitely come back for lunch.. the pricing is reasonable for dinner but the lunch pricing is a steal! We ordered the tempura dinner and there were so many pieces, tho most of the pieces are sweet potato. However at $15, it was not bad. We also ordered the small sushi boat. The sushi didn't come out on a boat but perhaps that is better since the rolls come out as soon as they are made. The best roll of course is japango - this is worth $12 alone! The top is torched, which really brings out the flavor. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Location: 4/5
Value: 5/5

This place honestly has some REALLY GREAT SUSHI. Don't be fooled by its modest looks, they make some fantastic tasting sushi. We ordered the sushi sashimi moriawase, perfect to share between two (as there are two of each nigiri). They do the classics really well and also had some unique cuts of fish (aka raw sweet shrimp, blowtorched items). Everything melts in your mouth and I personally think they have their rice ON POINT. We also tried their spicy salmon rolls and spicy scallop rolls - both delicious. However, I do prefer their nigiri over the rolls. 

The location is small, but very conveniently located right next to Bloor/Yonge Station. I think they have pretty efficient turnover since most people that came by during dinner time didn't seem to have too long of a wait before they were seated. I also know  that this is a very popular spot for takeout and delivery (JustEat), so you can beat the crowd that way."}
{"text":"Really good sushi with amazing fresh fish. Its not an ace place but if you want to save a bit of money, try the boats."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch this weekend. There was a good amount of parking spots available. The restaurant itself is small but we had no problem with getting a table. 

I ordered the Chirashi Lunch special for $13, which was well priced. It came with assorted sashimi with rice. The lunch specials all come with miso soup and salad. They're available on weekends too! Most places don't offer lunch specials on weekends. The salad ended up being a seaweed salad instead of the typical lettuce salads you would get as at other restaurants. I really liked it. The sashimi was a good size and tasted fresh. My only complaint about the Chirashi lunch is that it was served on a rather large plate. The plating was much too big for the table. I would have also preferred to have the rice in a bowl with the fish overtop but it wasn't really a big deal that it was plated instead. The presentation of food is really nice.

A Costco roll was ordered to share ($12). For those of you that don't know, this location is right next to a Costco so I felt a Costco roll was fitting. The roll had eel tempura, shrimp and avocado. It was good but I don't think I would order it again. I felt it was a bit pricy, especially since they also had a special where you can get 2 rolls for $7 (although they were more of basic rolls). 

As for service, I'm not sure if there was an actual waiter as I think it was the sushi chef who was taking orders. However, this wasn't an issue as we had no problems getting our order in and they came around to fill up our drinks. But I could see it become more difficult to get service if the place were busier. 

Overall, the food was good and I would come back. 

(You don't have to pay tax if you pay with cash)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite. My friend and I went around 6pm to grab a light bite and we were delighted with Wow Sushi. We sat down right away and the place began to fill up as we were there. They served us miso soup and tea as soon as we sat down. The service was quick and friendly. We ordered edamame and tempura as well as an avocado cucumber roll and a dynamite roll. The food was quick and fresh. We both agreed that it was a gem of a place and I will totally go back when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"They have another store in Yonge/Bloor which is also impressive! Yonge roll and Dragon roll are really good."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I've heard good things about the downtown one and I'm always looking for good sushi places. Located way in the corner of the plaza on New Delhi. The sign is really easy to see. Interior is clean and simple, the kitchen side is a little more industrial looking but not a big deal.  Not too much seating but it's an okay amount.
Service was really nice here - the chefs and the server greet you on the way in. She really nice and kept trying to refill our tea and asked us how our food was.

On to the food. We ordered a green dragon roll ($12), salmon lover's lunch (13), and a set of two rolls (7 dollars, 16 pieces total).

All the ingredients were fresh. The salmon lover's lunch came with sashimi, sushi, and salmon avocado rolls. The fish tasted great and was the meal presented really nicely. The sashimi was sliced to a nice thickness and for some reason felt slimy? But the taste was quite good. Even the salmon in the roll tasted good. The only thing was the rice - for the sushi it was kind of dry and slightly hard! And on the chewier side. Not so great. Everything else was fine though - even the avocado was at a good ripeness.

The two rolls for 7 dollars is a good deal, however you pay for what you get. It's a combination of the cheaper rolls (yam/avocado/cucumber/tempura bits/etc.) Presentation didn't look quite as nice and I don't know how you could screw up the taste of rolls with one or two ingredients in them. If you just want something super clean and simple and cheap you could go for this.

Portion wise it was on the small side - surprising since I'm used to restaurants giving huge rolls. I wasn't 100% full and I'm a light eater so keep that in mind. I might try this place again - everything tasted good except maybe the sushi rice. I would probably choose another place because there are others around that also have fresh ingredients with a similar price point and bigger portions. That being said, Wow Sushi is still probably a solid choice for food. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my new GO-TO sushi restaurant for sure. I don't typically write reviews for anyone or anything, good or poor experience.. but I couldn't help myself this time.

I discovered this place because I ordered delivery via Skip The Dishes. Omg.. The soup was piping hot when it arrived, the salad was cold and fresh, the sashimi tasted like it just took a direct flight from Japan. So because of this impressive meal I decided to try the place for dinner.

I was raving about this place to my boyfriend on the drive over... And it did not disappoint. When we had arrived it was quiet, just us (just the way I like it). The tea came immediately, we placed our order, and the rest is history. Everything was fresh and melt in your mouth. Food came fast. Tea was always filled. Service was A1. I could not be happier.

For all the Sour Patch Kids giving this place a 3 star review....... Lol you're tripping.

For more info, look at the photos."}
{"text":"Amazingly good sushi. 

I finally had the opportunity to eat here on Saturday with my Yelp pal Chad M. 
I was definitely impressed by the food and service. With the complimentary soup and salad for our starters, we shared the dinner sashimi plate and salmon rolls. The food is crafted with care and beautifully presented.   

Everything you've heard about how fresh the food is true: the fish, rice and all other ingredients are fresh and excited my taste buds with each bite. I would have no problem eating more than what we ordered  - I'm a bit of a sushi nut - but it opened up an opportunity for me to return and try more.

Service was top notch thanks to the friendliness of the staff. You're treated like gold here which makes the eating experience that much more magnificent."}
{"text":"With such high Yelp ratings and number of reviews, I had high hopes for this place.  Went in for a quick week night dinner after visiting the museum with my toddler and the restaurant was so tiny that they were barely able to get the high chair to our table.  We ordered tempura dinner, cucumber maki and a sashimi dinner.  

Tempura dinner arrived very quickly alongside complimentary miso soups and a few bowls of rice.  The shrimp tempura was ok and the accompanying veggies were plentiful.  The cucumber maki fell apart as soon as my daughter took her first bite and the rest of the maki suffered the same fate of not so well rolled maki.  

My sashimi dinner was the real disappointment though.  The fish were sliced so small that even with 18 (?) pieces, the plate looked sparse.  To make it worse (at least for me), there were too many torched/cooked fish on my sashimi dinner.  Variety was also not so great as most of the plate was dominated by oily fish (salmon, butterfish, mackerel...etc).  

I had an upset stomach afterwards so I don't think I'll be going back to this joint again.  It's such a shame to see a highly rated place fail so miserably."}
{"text":"Came in without a reservation on a chilly winter night and I was surprised to see that the restaurant was much smaller than what I had anticipated from the photos.  This tiny 40 seater dining room was packed with just one waitress serving the dining room which made for a very slow evening.  

We had to share a 6 person table with another couple who was already seated there.  How very European, I thought.  We ordered some a la carte sushi and a small sashimi platter with seaweed salad for our meal.  The sashimi platter was very unimpressive as half of the platter was loaded with salmon.  The lack of variety is really what took away from our experience and when we tried to order more a la carte sushi, we were told that they ran out of fish.  Only fish they had were tuna and salmon!  This explained the dominant presence of salmon in the sashimi platter.  They also hadn't received their liquor license so we had to dine without our usual hot sake.  

Overall, I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat fish here any time soon.  I'll give them another chance later in the year when they will have worked all the bugs out of running a restaurant."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh, which is really all you can ask from a sushi place... My friend ordered the sashimi dinner ($26) which came with a great selection of sashimi (tuna belly, tuna, salmon, sweet shrimp, uni, octopus... though she mentioned that the selection differed greatly from the last time she ordered it), while I ordered the ten zaru (cold soba noodles with tempura - $12) and a side of uni ($10/4 pieces). The food - ALL of it - was impeccable. The service, on the other hand, is the only reason this place didn't get that 5th star... The server spent a lot of time at the sushi bar chit-chatting with the chefs. Despite the fact the space is already tiny, and doesn't seat many, it made the service seem that much longer because our waiter was so preoccupied with his conversation."}
{"text":"This one star review is for the reception I received at Wow Suishi. After reading all the great reviews on Yelp I needed to check this place out. I arrived at 9pm. They close at 10pm. I asked when I entered if they were still serving as there was no one there. They said yes - last call is at 9:30pm.  So being a table of one and knowing I was there to eat vs. dine and it was sushi... I went in. I had the sashimi plate and sake.  I was served promptly and I will say the food was very good. However, no sooner had I sat down then the lights went on full bright, the music was turned off, the mops and brooms came out to sweep and clean the floor in this very small restaurant space.  The chairs were put up on top of all the tables, except of course the one in which I was sitting.   This all took place between 9:00 and 9:20 PM. I ate and drank very quickly and left with $50 less in my purse. The place is a bit more expensive but I do think if I had the time to enjoy the food it was very good. HOWEVER,  Wow Suishi, don't allow customers in if you're not prepared to give them full service. I could've spent my 50 bucks easily somewhere else and came back another time when they were fully open.  I know restaurants don't like when you get there just before closing but a full one hour ahead of closing does not seem inappropriate to me. I ate fast and spent $50 in 25 minutes - that is $2 a minute! All I can say is Wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmmmmm..wow, I didn't expect that! My friends been raving about this place for a bit and I've always been skeptical but after giving it a try tonight, I can't believe I haven't come sooner! Very fresh sushi. We got the tempera app and the small sushi boat. I was expecting an actual boat with the typical California rolls, salmon sushi, cucumber roll to fill the space etc, but it was actual legit rolls and torched sushi pieces. I wouldn't say each of the rolls or sushi pieces were extremely tasty but it's definitely above the average and for the price, it's a pretty good deal! We came on a Tuesday night and it got packed real fast. The servers were friendly however there was only one server working the whole night so it took a while to get her attention to order and to get the bill - thus knocking off a star."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in town. Always fresh , great service, & friendly servers. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend - it was a cozy small sushi place off of Yonge St. in Toronto. 

I came in with no expectations except that their website didn't seem to be working very well. haha.

We were seated immediately in a spot near the front window. The makeup of the venue seemed to be mostly made of students and hospital workers of the University St. hospitals nearby. 

The menu has a decent selection of raw and cooked options. 

We had:
- Agedashi Tofu
- Yonge St. Roll
- Spicy Salmon Roll
- Chirashi
- Unaju Dinner 
- Assortment of Sushi including Ikura and Uni

Overall the food tasted good. I was constantly thrown off by the fact that the dishes didn't look quite as I expected. As an example - the Chirashi came out on a large round plate with a serving of rice and the sashimi placed around the dish. Call me a traditionalist but it just wasn't what I was expecting. The same could be said about my girlfriend's Unaju dinner - the first time the dish came out, the eel was battered and deep fried, not grilled as expected.

All in all, a decent place that I'll keep in mind for future when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"good sushi, went there with my girlfriend for a few nice rolls. The ambience was decent and the sushi was definitely well prepared with a strong attention to detail. If you don't mind the fake japanese chef barking random orders at the waitresses, this place is a go. Simliar to Japango, but probably one notch lower."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Bloor area.  Had the small sushi boat, it was so good!!! It is prefect for two people.

I would say Japango/Yuzu are still better.  But this place is good value =)"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +/5 for service

If you're expecting an experience similar to the downtown location, your expectations might fall a bit short. However for Markham quality, this place is definitely up there for best in the city.

I dined here on New Years Eve as my second last dinner spot before flying back to Winnipeg. I passed by this location many times, but never dined in here as my parents were hesitant on whether this place is good or not. I finally convinced them on New Years Eve, since most other places we wanted to go were already fully booked.

The menu was markedly different than the downtown branch, which I guess was due to the difference in clientele. There's also a lot more take out orders and not so much in terms of dine in.

My family had the chicken karaage, tuna avocado tar tar, sushi sashimi moriawase, WoW roll, Yonge roll, and Japango roll. The food was really good aside from the chicken karaage, which was only mediocre. There was a wide variety of aburi sushi and sashimi in the moriawase dish, which I personally like. We even ordered the WoW roll and Japango roll twice cause my parents loved it so much.

Service was excellent, though it'd be an interesting experiment to come when it's busier next time. Nonetheless, I'll likely return next time I'm back in the GTA. My parents are likely regulars now here."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Wow. Not so much the food quality, but the value for their lunches.

I came here alone for Saturday lunch at around noon, and there was another single table, a table of 4, and a table of 2; quite busy overall. I was welcomed by the male (owner?) sushi chef and a lady waitress, and was promptly served tea, salad, and miso soup. The miso soup was decent, the salad was okay though wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.

I ordered the sushi lunch. Normally I prefer sashimi over sushi, but I was on a slightly tight budget and would rather pay $12 over $15 in this case. I was impressed with the quality of the sushi; one of the reasons why I go sashimi over sushi is the rice quantity, but the proportion here is perfect, as well as the fact the rice actually tasted fresh! The chef also chose some unique kinds of fish in addition to the salmon and tuna fish, and they all tasted very good! I never found out what they actually were in the end. The spicy salmon roll that came with it was probably the disappointment of the meal, as it fell apart quite easily after I picked it up. For $12 though, 8 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of rolls is a really good deal.

I hope to try the sashimi if I'm ever with friends, as this place really seems to know what good quality raw fish is."}
{"text":"Ordered agedashi tofu and was pleased at the portion for the price. It was only $3, so for that alone, I'll be coming back.

I ordered the Chirashi Lunch ($13) and it was all delicious. The wasabi was hotter than any other I've tried, and all the fish tasted great. 

The miso soup was yummy, but I prefer a more vinegary taste on the salad that I've had other places (but my Japanese friend said the salad tasted like ones she's had in Tokyo.

I guess WOW SUSHI doesn't get the full 5 stars because it's a little pricey for my student budget, but I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sushi was top quality and service was exceptional.  5 of us arrived on a Sunday night and they shuffled some tables to accommodate us.  Portions were a bit small but I am used to Los Angeles portions so I can't give a negative star for that.  But the rolls were just not 5 star, its a small place and chefs were interactive, and service was quick...but I just can't give the 5th star.  I asked for the most popular roll and i think it was the Japango roll,  a B roll at best.  Soft Shell Crab was excellent.  Salmon Sushi were very small, but very good cuts.  Overall we had a really nice meal and I would go back."}
{"text":"Loved the food! We ordered tori karaage ($5), Alaska roll ($12) and Japango roll ($12). It's a very cozy small place in Markham. We didn't need to wait for a table. The staff was very welcoming and nice! Definitely worth a try and would go back."}
{"text":"This is our regular sushi restaurant now, in a location with four respectable nearby competitors, all of which we've tried. While the sushi is not as phenomenal as Japango restaurant near City Hall (our city-wide favourite), the sushi at Wow is consistently delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that it's cheap and the candy at the end is great, along with the tea and soup. But my rolls were not great (spicy salmon and spicy tuna), and they forgot one of our rolls. I would probably give it 2.5/5. Convenient location and great prices."}
{"text":"The sushi is incredible I had the wow sushi and japango roll and it looks like art but the price is way too expensive their lunch special.is not bad but it doesn't really fill you up its 2 rolls for 7 dollars. When I went there I got the 42 piece sushi but it was so good I ate it so fast. There's a certain texture about the sushi that is really addicting and it melts in your mouth I think they haveeally good quality fish. I only come here once in a while on occasion because it's is pretty expensive for sushi."}
{"text":"This is my Yorkville go-to. It's conveniently located just steps from the Varsity cinema and offers consistently good food and service. Lunch specials are a steal (chirashi lunch for $13 including soup and salad and tea!), and the dinner options are not too expensive either. A sushi dinner will fill you up for $22. It's kind of between those Annex budget sushi places and higher end options like Ja Bistro or Yuzu. They are usually pretty fast, which is good if you are on a short lunch break or need to catch a movie! 

Nothing much to add, but just to echo others' comments. Fish is so fresh and nicely presented! Your tea cup will never go empty. Like Japango, they have a chopstick wall for regular customers to keep their chopsticks - a cute idea. 

They take reservations, but unless you are a big group or it's Friday/Saturday, you should be able to get a table just walking in."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time last night for dinner and service was horrible. I sat down and was there for about 15 minutes before they came over and greeted us. After she said hi and gave us our drinks she took another 15 minutes to give us our drinks. We waited so long and the restaurant was not busy. We decided to get up and leave after waiting for so long. I felt bad, but horrible service is the worst."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials! Great price and lots of choices. I'm a big fan of the sashimi don and always quite happy with it. Instead of big pieces of fish, there are some chopped and some are in pieces, the torched butterfish is one of one absolute favourite, buttery and smoky with fried garlic on top as garnish added some texture to it. The octopus is also great touch, add bite to the dish. I like the variety of this dish and according to the chef and what is available it subject to change so it is a pleasant surprise what you end up getting. The sushi lunch is pretty great as well. Grab a friend or co-worker to share a couple of different dishes. It is nice to go early for lunch since they normally take lunch break around 2:30pm."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and I already know we will be coming back here very often! Sushi was soo fresh and the rice in the sushi was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever. The fish are always so fresh and I honestly love their soy sauce, I can tell it's low in sodium but so tasty. This is the only place I eat wasabi too. Servers and the chef are uber friendly and I just can't say enough good things. I love their lunch specials! You can't go wrong with the price and value, probably the best sushi I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was definitely better than any of the other little sushi joints around. We had one maki combo and one roll combo and split them between us. It also came with miso and a salad. The lunch combo was a bit more expensive than what you can get on Bloor or in other places, but it was worth it for the higher quality. We had decided we were done with sushi in Toronto, but finding Wow! might just have put it back in the rotation."}
{"text":"Food:  ordered a platter, the sushi was really fresh. The blowtorched sushi was really well done

Service: the servers were really kind and were always coming back to check up on our table

Environment: a bit small, however it is very cozy and good for conversation.

Will come again."}
{"text":"The only Japanese restaurant in my immediate vicinity.  I am thankful for it's existence.  The chef increases the value of his prepared rolls by putting extra effort into presentation and preparation (even blow-torched sushi and rolls).  The sauces accompanying the rolls were also flavourful and a major plus.  These features separated it from base level Japanese restaurants. The owner also prepared complimentary age dashi tofu with generous amounts of bonito flakes and seaweed. Thank you.  

The bad are that the quality of the fish itself was middling, lacking in flavor. I had the white,  tuna,  and red tuna as part of my platter.  I would hope the chef would work with a better supplier. I recognise the value he added with his preparation of the fish,  but the base ingredient was lacking. Maybe it was just the fish selections in my plate? He can do better, though I'm sure this would come at a cost to customers.  Regardless,  still better than the fish you'd find at main street sushi nearby (if it's not closed by now). Sorry! 

Service was exemplary.  

I note: the cooked foods served at other tables looked really good!  Especially the tempura dinner!  I actually wish I had ordered that instead, but when you crave sushi.... 

TL;DR chef makes good effort in preparing.  Works with ingredients to bring value to the customer,  but the base ingredients lacking in quality (-1 star happens here).  Would hope owner works with a better fish supplier.  Did not try the cooked food,  but wish I did!  Check out the tempura dinner.  It looks...  Right. Good service.  Complimentary appetiser was appreciated. Convenient location."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and sashimi. Good quality fish. Great prices, especially their lunch deals. Not the greatest service (unfriendly waitress), but I don't even care because it's such delicious sushi at such a great price.

Will definitely eat here again. So much better than any sushi you'll find in yorkville for a much better price."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, i had to try the grand opening special tray.

Nice friendly staff.

Overall the sushi was very tasty!

What i did notice was the size of the rolls were smaller than other places.
The fish for the sushi were thin.
The rice is not the best rice.

Still a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in downtown Toronto. Everything that arrives at the table is delivered with care and an artful twist. The sushi tastes fresh compared to much of what is served elsewhere. The friendly staff and intimate space of this restaurant make it perfect for small groups or date night. Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"There really aren't that many good mid-range, legitimate sushi places in Markham. Thankfully, WoW is one of them.

I've been to WoW a number of times now, and I have to say, it's definitely my go-to place for good quality sashimi and sushi for reasonable value. I typically get the $15 sashimi lunch (I've had both as takeout and sit in), which gives you chef's choice of fish. Unlike the other Markham restaurants of a similar price point you're getting things like scallop, uni, bc tuna, butter fish, sea bream, in addition to the usual salmon, tuna, octopus, surf clam. As this is chef's choice, your items will vary based on their supply, but it's not uncommon for me to get most or nearly all of those higher end items - uni, sea bream, butter fish, etc. And some of these are seared. They don't phone it in. I might be out of the loop but the only other place I can think of that provides bc tuna, butter fish and sea bream for lunch at a reasonable price is Japango, and that will be more than $15 per-tax and in downtown Toronto. 

For lunch you can also look at their 2 rolls (the simpler ones, not the fancy ones) for $7, which also includes soup. That's a really good deal. I've also tried the karaage which is pretty decent too. For dinner I've had the sashimi dinner (which is the dinner version of sashimi lunch - a few more pieces of sashimi, at a higher cost) and also the sushi moriawase, which is $35.

The quality of fish is high and consistent, the miso soup I think is pretty decent (not overly salty like at some places), and they use a good quality soy sauce. As well, the people are friendly. And like others mentioned, there's a discount (not sure if this is a temporary deal or something they plan to keep) if you're paying in cash.

The major drawback is the location is small (there are only a few - maybe 6-8 tables), so if you would like to eat in, you should probably call if it's the weekend. Otherwise, take out is always an option. I suppose another drawback (for some) is that there's no bento box option. This is not an issue for me."}
{"text":"Came here for diner tonight. Wow Sushi is a small location, but we came earlier so we easily got a table. As soon as we arrived the server gave us cold water, tea, miso soup xand salad. We ordered the rainbow roll,  sashimi combo and the tempura veggies.r The food came quickly. Everything was delicious and the food was fresh. The price was also fair and the staff very friendly.  I  will come again."}
{"text":"4.5*  WOW, this place really surprised me!

Having already been to Japango, Yuzu, Sushi Couture, and refusing to go to Kaji (min. $120/pp, are you kiddin' me??!!), I decided on Wow for a sushi lunch, based on the reviews + pics.

(This is another establishment that I would've totally walked by had it not been for Yelp.  Being just off Yonge, I'm sure it goes unnoticed.)

Anyway, this is what was ordered:  Agedashi Tofu ($3), Kirin ($4), Sushi Lunch ($13, 8 - nigiri/8 maki), a Philadelphia ($7), Salmon Avocado ($5), & Avocado/Tempura Yam roll ($5).  We would've been OK if we skipped the extra Avocado/Yam roll - that was overkill!!! 

This place totally blows my fav Mississauga place outta the water!  First of all, it's not only cheaper, but there's more variety in the cuts of fish being offered in something like Sushi Lunch.  Sure, the pieces are smaller, but I'd rather have variety than bigger pieces any day!  As you can see, the prices are very reasonable, at least for lunch.

Fish was fresh and they charred at least half of the nigiri pieces that came with the Lunch.  Complimentary Soup/Salad came even before we ordered!  Service was pleasant.  For some reason, I preferred it over Japango.  

Wished this place was closer to me!"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times before for take out. So my review is based purely on the food and the service I received when placing my order on the phone and when picking up.

Every time I order - I only get the sashimi - cause it's so fresh. This is probably the freshest and one of the best sashimi's I can get in the Markham area so it's hard to resist getting this once a week. I always get one of the sashimi platters they have, it's never really specified what I will be getting in my order, but I'm always more than happy with what I get. The sashimi you get is pretty much any sashimi they have on their a la carte menu, but one time I got oyster too. 
The presentation of the sashimi in the take out box is always really nice too. 

It's a litttllee pricey, but to be honest, you're paying for the quality so in my opinion, it's worth it.

When I call in to order, they always get it right and it's usually ready within 20 minutes.

So just purely based on my take-out experience, if I am to ever dine in here, I'll update my review. But for now, I love this place for take-out sashimi!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. We ask for a plate with all the recommendations from the chef and it was wonderful. The price is perfect and the flavors can't be better. Love it!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for a very late dinner and it was one of the few places in the area that was still open. 

Roll selection was great, but not so much for sushi. I visited this place a while ago so they probably have their liquor liscene by now! The quality of the sushi is very similar to all you can eat sushi places. For what you end up spending here, it will probably be around the same for what you pay at AYCE. 

There are way too many great sushi places in GTA and wow just does not compare."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is really friendly. I wish they had more of a restaurant inside"}
{"text":"TLDR: Prepare your taste buds for an amazing assault.
Quality - 5/5
Quantity - 4.5/5
Value - 4.75/5
Service - 4.25/5

Small boat plus Spider roll.

The good: 
The portions of meat was very high compared to the rice.
The rice was perfectly prepared, melt in your mouth good and extremely subtle.
The ambience was quiet and cozy, it was warm as well (in winter you don't want to wear a coat in a restaurant).
The servers were friendly and when asked what each meat was in the boat made sure we knew what each was.
The actual meat was to die for (some of the best I have ever tasted) they each had distinct flavour and none seemed to be old but rather all had a fresh taste.
The lighting was perfect.
A great place to go regularly or a great second date place.
The bad:
I said second date because it is small, and \"cozy\" but not in a date way. As in, I'm broad, 6' tall and I was a bit pressed for space. 
The bill wasn't asked for, it just came automatically despite that there wasn't any rush.
After payment we had to ask for tea (which is complementary), and it was slow in arriving.

Summary: I am planing to go back ASAP, try a few other dishes, see if the bad was only situational or rare. The food is worth it."}
{"text":"When my friend told me about this place I wasn't expecting anything at all.

Well, to be perfectly honest... I was expecting it to be terrible. I guess I shouldn't be so quick to judge a restaurant by its name.

Miso soup and salad were brought to the table as soon as we sat down, that was nice.

The first things I noticed about the chirashi dinner was that it was served on a plate instead of a bowl, and that the sushi rice was warm. I've never had chirashi with warm sushi rice before, and I actually liked it a lot. I was also impressed with the selection that came with the chirashi, there was a good mix of raw and lightly seared fish.

Great value, good sushi, would go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of traditional, high-end nigiri and decided to try this place based on the favorable reviews. 

Disappointment. The nigiri is a definite and sizable step below JaBistro, Zen, Kaji, and Yasu.
It's similar in quality to Shinobu. 
The fish was fresh but the rice wasn't the right temperature, taste, or consistency."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night recently and expected a packed house (from reading the other reviews) but was pleasantly surprised to get a table.

I ordered the small boat and enjoyed it.  At $45 I'd say it's a bit pricey but the quality of the food was excellent, the service was fast, and the variety was good.

Fave roll of the night was definitely the Japango roll!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place - we wandered in at a weird time late afternoon, but were seated promptly and service was quick. The room has a lovely, cozy feel. Our sushi was fresh tasting with really cute presentation, and I especially loved the agedashi tofu. It's wasn't soggy at all due to the plating (laid out in a shallow dish instead of a bowl), which was a nice plus. For the quality, I thought everything was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Been for lunch a few times and had the sushi lunch, which was excellent each time. The service is the best I have ever encountered, as the food is delivered in minutes and is very good quality!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times because it is close to where I work, it's not the best sushi place in the area and it's not the worst. The store itself is cute and the servers are generally pleasant. However it kind of felt like they were annoyed by me/making fun of me, and the menu was hard to read. The selections were not very vast but the ingredient quality and prices almost make up for it."}
{"text":"The food was more of a western style Japanese food. Wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was good either."}
{"text":"The service here is really good, even when ordering takeout. The interior is casual but looks really nice. They had a takeout 13% discount as part of their opening special when you pay with cash. I like that they also take credit card. 

I ordered 2 vegetarian rolls to go. The yam avocado roll and the avocado cucumber roll. Both of them tastes good but I found the sizes to be very small compared to other sushi places. 

Since this is pretty much the only Japanese food in the area, I will definitely be returning. Especially for the lunch specials which would make getting 2 vegetarian rolls much more worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Wow a few times now and have found them to be pretty consistent. The place is really small but is never too busy (which concerns me!). Their lunch menu is pretty good value at $10-$13 which includes a salad and miso soup.

My go to lunch menu item is their Katsu Don which you can have with either fried pork or chicken. The portion is generous and the taste is great. The one thing to note is the meat you choose is always in the rice already and the breaded meat is no longer crispy.

For rolls, my favourite is the Narudo roll which is wrapped in a cucumber instead of rice. 

I've taken out their platters before too and can say they are pretty good value and have a decent variety. 

For me, the location is a 2 minute drive from home and is an easy choice if I'm craving for some quick sushi. Recommended."}
{"text":"At most 3.5. Pretty average meal, 24 rolls for $20. We got the Maki Dinner which came with the salmon and avocado roll, Dynamite roll and Alaska roll. The Alaska roll would be my favourite.

Unfortunately, the rice was dry and clearly not fresh. Minus 1 star. 

Staff is friendly, the food came out pretty quickly ... but then again they weren't as busy."}
{"text":"This place is small and not very good with service.  Watch out for red flying fish roe!  It tasted like DDT, insects spray!!!   I have told the server and they said that they have opened a new box which did not solve the issue!!! It is terrible to know that the server did not care about the food they serve nor their customers!!!   Bad experience and bad services!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a local sushi place. I tried their sushi lunch special which came with 6-8 pieces of sushi (some raw and some slightly torched), yellow tail roll, miso soup, and salad for around $15. It was a great deal and definitely preferred torched ones to the raw ones. Would definitely go back for lunch. May even be my go to sushi for lunch. But would I go back for dinner? Probably not. 

Their unaju, $15, which was microwaved right in front of me, was decent. Comes with seaweed salad. The taste was there but if cooked right before with meatier eel, it would have been better. I guess it is $15. 

So overall, pretty decent. Definitely a lunch place which is what my review is on, not a dinner place."}
{"text":"I think I enjoyed the second time around here at wow. I had lunch and got the wow roll, japango roll and the sashimi lunch platter. 

The rolls were perfect as there wasn't too much rice in it but had a variety of ingredients. The fish torched on top of the sushi were soft and juicy which compliments the sushi rolls.

I think the best is the sashimi platter. It was $15 (I think) which gives you a good amount and variety of high quality, fresh sashimi. There were a few pieces of UNI which was surprising as we all know Uni is typically expensive. 

Service is good. The waiter checked up on us a few times and refilled our water."}
{"text":"Tiny little sushi spot with delicious food!

Fortunately, we got in right before the dinner rush. We were able to snag a table for two right by the window, perfect for people watching and admiring the city.

Small space with minimal decor but the sushi chefs are lively and quick to greet you upon arrival and departure.

We had...

Tuna Tar Tar - The tuna was fresh and delicious chopped with chunks of fresh avocado and topped lightly with a ponzu sauce. Not drenched in sauce - just right if you ask me. 

Spicy Salmon Roll - Delicious. My favorite.

Rainbow Roll - Fresh.

Alaska Roll - The menu didn't mention that this was cooked salmon skin. I was expecting the standard fresh salmon. Also, this roll was topped with Unagi sauce which I wasn't a fan of.

Agedashi Tofu - Good but not as sticky as the Agedashi Tofu I am used to. 

Seaweed Salad - Delicious. Not too much dressing. ON POINT.

Our dinner came with a garden salad mixed with ginger dressing and miso soup. 

Their fish is excellent quality. I actually regret not ordering Sashimi. They use just the right amount of rice - not too much and the rice texture and taste is perfect. 

The Tuna Tar Tar, Seaweed Salad and Spicy Salmon Roll were my top three favorites!

The prices were good.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Very average experience. We walked into the restaurant and none of the tables were cleaned. It was only later when I realised they only have two staff members! One of them was working the kitchen while the other one did everything else. 

Food was rather average and the sushi was really small. We ordered the small platter (42 pieces) for two people and was still hungry after dinner. The fish was marginal and sushi rice did not hold very well. They did offer us uni which was nice, but that was probably the highlight of the whole platter. The pieces will also come at different times, on different plates.

Overall, it was a below average experience, but I am giving it 3 stars because of how much effort the staff put in."}
{"text":"I LOVE Wow Sushi! I used to live around the block from this place and I continue to order from them online and even make the trek out despite living in a different part of Montreal. 

Sushi is consistently good, great selection, and most of all, amazing service!

The owner is very friendly and always goes the extra mile for his customers. 

Will continue to eat here as long as I live in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Been to this place lots of times. Always reliable. The only thing I'd say is it's a bit more expensive that I'd like, and the portions aren't that big. But clearly it's quality over quantity here. 

My two favourite rolls are:

Louis Maki
Calapilla Maki


They also have really good brown rice which you can substitute. Nice place."}
{"text":"Best sushi I had! So fresh and good quality and the price is amazing for what you get. My new go to spot"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is a reincarnation of Japango (since the original still exists in all of its gloriousness), but there is a photo of the chef and the late Jack Layton posing in front of what looks like Japango on the walls. Regardless of where the chef has worked before or who he is affiliated with though, there is no arguing that the quality and presentation of the food at Wow! is fantastic and comparable to other Japanese favourites of mine in the city.

The artfully presented chirashi features organic salmon, head-on shrimp, and a beautiful array of delicately sliced fish. The service is warm, the space is nicely sized (not too big, but not too small for a cozy restaurant). The decor is minimalist and tasteful.

There is surely no shortage of sushi options around this area, but I would pass the others by and walk that extra mile to Wow! any day."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I had HUGE expectations for Wow Sushi. I was a little disappointed by my meal as a result - it was definitely good sushi, but I had expected mind blowing! 

Wow Sushi is a tiny little sushi shop with only a few tables - maybe 10 total. Their menu is quite extensive, including appetizers (such as the deep fried tofu - yum!), lunch specials, dinner sets, and a la carte. 

On this occasion, I had the sushi dinner as well as the black dragon maki roll, as well as your typical starter miso soup and salad. First of all, the salad was really good! Way better than a typical salad, though it was basically the same set-up. Only difference was their amazing dressing! Way more flavourful than your usual, and it wasn't creamy. The sushi itself was definitely delicious, everything was well prepared, fresh, and a great selection. I also love that the server explained where all the fish was from, what it was, and how they had prepared it. The maki roll was also good, but I've had other rolls just as delicious in other places. 

The service was really good as well - just two people running the place, but they managed to be prompt and friendly the whole time. Our tofu appetizer was complementary as well, which was definitely a bonus! 

Cost-wise, I'm not sure that the price is totally justified. The sushi is definitely good, but $22 for a sushi dinner ($26 for sashimi!) is a bit much for me. 

If I lived in the area, I could see myself stopping by here again - but I can't imagine myself going out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars**

** 4 stars ** 
- super fast service (from order take out to get out of the shop within 10 minute) 

- discount if pay by cash

- selection of fish: I am surprise to see little urchin, on small amaebi (sweet shrimp) as part of the Chirashi. The freshness of fish was OK. 

** 3 stars ** 
- small amount of rice and quality was OK. The sushi rice lacks flavours 

- salad only contained a few slices of lettuce, but the salad dressing was nice. 

I would like to go back to try their other offerings like sashimi lunch or sashimi don."}
{"text":"Tried this sushi spot on a whim while on the area and craving sushi with a friend. Lots of good reviews on Yelp helped us choose this place!
It was smaller than we had thought, but that's not a big deal. Upon sitting down we were served miso and tea which was nice. 
We ordered the dragon roll, spicy salmon, rainbow roll and the Louis roll. All had good flavour, though portions seemed small for the price. 
The rice was warm, and spicy mayo was a fun surprise. They seemed to be torching a lot of their rolls which was interesting, gave a cool flavour to the eel. 
Will stop by again if in the area"}
{"text":"Lunch menu is decent and standard selection. Had the sushi lunch and salmon lunch, everything tasted fresh and of good quality. Ordered the 2rolls for $7 on top so much for two came to over $36.00.
Note for the spicy salmon/tuna fans, it's actually really spicy and a different heat that lingers which irritated me as you couldn't switch bites to another sushi/sashimi piece. Even eating the ginger didn't qualm the heat or chili on your palate, so if you go that route eat that last! 

Parking is ok but busy being shared with so many tenants in the plaza, place is clean and cozy. Nothing extremely amazing but not bad either, try this place if you're in the area but wouldn't drive over from too far.

No more promo eat in prices from grand opening, only on take out orders."}
{"text":"We're nearby and Yelp indicated this was nearby for a good lunch spot with kids. It was empty inside around 1pm - I think more people will choose takeout because there are only around 6 groups of tables for sit-in. 

Ordered two sushi meals from the lunch specials. $12 and $15, I believe it was Sushi Lunch and Salmon Lovers. Also ordered Yaki Udon. The lunch specials came with salad and miso soup. Both were very tasty and enjoyable. Hot green tea also accompanied the meal which was also great. 

Sushi lunch specials were below average. The portions were small. The sashimi on top of the rice was poorly sliced and did not look fresh (you can see that they're not smooth and firm). Rice around the rolls were dry, and the rolls lacked substance. My friend who took one course from George Brown can do a much better job than this. Granted, I've only been here once and maybe they were having an off day. 

Udon noodles were very wet and you can barely see any chicken pieces in it, but my kids actually ate a lot so that was good. The sushi and sashimi should be the star of the menu at a Sushi restaurant though. 

Not \"Wow\" sushi. Will not be returning. 

P.s. If you do want to sit in, there is no tax if you pay cash but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"According to Yelp this was the most decent sushi around the area. Was craving for sushi and this was the best thing around here. Portions are a bit small and just tastes average. Hard to compare becase I been used to eating sushi from Van where its fresh and much cheaper. Service was great. They refill your tea often and take your finished dishes away quite quick. At the end you get milk candy with your bill. Come only if you around the area, dont purposely come because im sure there better sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had read good reviews for this one online and were craving some sushi but couldn't get in for dinner the night before. Deciding we could do Japanese food one more time, we went in for lunch the next day - NOT DISAPPOINTED! Our food arrived quickly (although we needed to send a reminder for our edamame) and was so fresh, so good. I, personally, enjoy smaller rolls so that I don't fill up on the rice and can actually finish my meal, and thought that the price matched up with the quantity quite nicely. The service was also friendly and we were greeted as we entered and bid adieu when we left. Overall, a very positive experience and one that I would seek out again!"}
{"text":"Solid sushi place with delicious food and nice decor! All the fish we ordered was fresh, their spicy rolls were actually spicy, and the service was quick/courteous. Tempura was good as well.

Probably the best place i've had sushi at downtown. But be warned you pay for it, definitely not one of the bargain sushi places."}
{"text":"This sushi place has amazing customer service and excellent food. Prices are great. I love bringing my friends here for sushi."}
{"text":"So good! 
A small place tucked away on the street behind Manulife building. 
I didn't notice this place until a friend recommended it. 

Try the Japango roll.
It is the best.
Great service too. Gave us tofu appetizer on the house."}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant with decent food and service. Katsu Don took a long time but it tasted great. Note that they charge extra if you are paying by credit."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch based on the reviews and had maki lunch. It consisted of shrimp  tempura roll, spicy roll and california roll for $16. Sounds like a good deal right? I asked the waitress for spicy mayo she said there was charge which was fine. It had a bright orange oily colour to it and looked clump. Immediately turned me off. The maki lunch arrived and tempura shrimp was ok at best. The 'spicy roll' which the waitress said was salmon was white and diced up with lettuce. It looked inedible and the california roll was tasteless. I did not eat both rollls and the chef and waitress scoffed at me and charged me full price which was the cherry on top. As a torontonion foodie do not bother on this one.."}
{"text":"This place totally deserves 5 stars. I've only been here once, but I already can't wait to go back. I thought Japango had the best sushi in the city, but I would put WOW Sushi as a fair contender. This place is definitely in my Top 5 in the city when it comes to rolls, sashimi and hand rolls. The restaurant itself is pretty small I should say, but the rolls are heavenly. Fresh ingredients combined with chef's passion to surprise the patrons with elaborate decorations on the plate make for a great experience. You know the place is authentic when it's owned and operated by Japanese. In this case, it's one of the few venues in the city which is indeed owned and operated by Japanese. if you have any doubts you absolutely owe yourself to check them out. Your tummy will be thanking you afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Wawawewa! Yelp buddies Jen and Chad, thanks for taking me to WOW Sushi.

Maki set lunch ($12) was pretty delicious. And the portion size was big for lunch. 

I didn't try any of the sashimi, but it was obvious from Chad & Jen's meals that the fish here is ridiculously fresh. Next time I will go for the Chirashi for sure.

Service was the usual over-the-top Japanese friendliness. (THANK YOU BYE!!!!, THANK YOU BYE!!!!)

Everything was perfect here except the decor is really quite simplistic. Makes for a great lunch but I can't see wanting to do a dinner here (especially a date)  since it's somewhat lacking ambiance."}
{"text":"I always get takeout here. Love their chirashi ($18) and sushi platter ($68). Their sushi platter is different from other jap places. It's not the \"usual\" sushi. Everytime is a surprise! However, their chirashi is on a small size (good portion for me, but a lot of guys find it too small)."}
{"text":"I really wish yelp allowed half stars because this place deserves a bit more than a 3. I've really been meaning to try this place since I saw it had some nice reviews.

I ordered over the phone for pickup to save time, and I'm glad I did. There's a 13% discount for all pickup orders (cash only)!

When I arrived I noticed that the place is a little small, so if you're dining in with a bigger group you may be a little smushed together. There's maybe 5-6 tables in the restaurant. The place was nicely decorated, but when you stand up you can see in plain view the entire kitchen and back area. It's actually kinda funny that more space is used for the kitchen than the seating area.

I really wanted to see what they had that was new so I ordered the japango, Louis and wow roll (recommended over the phone). After the discount it came to a little over $35. When I handed the cashier $41 she stopped for a minute and asked if I wanted my change. For takeout? I just thought that was a little funny, but didn't think much of it.

When we finally dove into those rolls they were pretty good. The wow roll was a bit over torched but the flavour was still on point. What I especially liked was that they had a little spice kick in them. However, I was a bit disappointed that the rolls were kind of small. For $12 each I had hoped they would be a little larger.

Overall this place was good. Sushi is nice and flavourful but kind of small. Without the discount I don't think I would be able to justify ordering the $12 rolls. I would definitely come back, maybe on a quiet afternoon for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Went back already and again loved it.

There was another waitress, who was very attentive and nice. The chef was a different one, also attentive though not as nice as the first one, but who similarly cared whether the food and service were good!"}
{"text":"Great sushi lunch specials I've tried a few and they usually give you at least a few premium pieces. 

The chirashi lunch is fantastic where else will give you uni too for less than 20$ !!! 
Everything is super fresh. My only complaint is that the restaurant is tiny and usually is packed. I've gotten take out a few times because of this."}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner from Wow Sushi for a year and a half without noticing it or trying it. I am so pleased that I read some reviews, and tried it for dinner with my husband. I've eaten Wow Sushi three times, and I think I can safely say this is some really really good sushi. It doesn't reach the levels of Miku or other high end sushi restaurants, but in terms of mid-range sushi, this is some of the best. 

I've only been here for dinner, and all three times I've had the small sushi boat. It comes with a mix of sushi and rolls. The fish is fresh. The rice to fish ratio is nearly perfect. There isn't much else to say, other than go to Wow Sushi now!!!

I absolutely love this place and will continue to return."}
{"text":"Fast service, amazinggggg food.  I got the spicey tuna roll and dragon roll.  Mmmm mmm."}
{"text":"We just went there for lunch & had delicious sashimi & salmon rolls!  It's small on the inside, but food was great!  We will be returning here for more sushi!"}
{"text":"Had a great sushi experience today. Great taste for the price range."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! The best sushi in Toronto! Their sushi are always fresh and delicious. I get the Japango roll, which is cuttle fish that is lightly heated with a blow torch. Their portions may seem small compared to other places like Sushi on Bloor but it's quality not quantity. Hands down, this is my favourite sushi place to go to. But recently, they've hiked up their prices and the salad and soup appetizers (which are free with any order) have gotten smaller. Their ice creams are nice, but nothing to write home about. Stick with the sushi or sashimi. The place is owned by 2 brothers who are super friendly. Great venue that's tucked away on Charles Street. It's near the Second Cup and next to 7 West Cafe. Go before 6 pm to get seats without waiting. Music is relaxing. It can be pricy for two to dine, but still the best sushi in town. A must try!"}
{"text":"This was probably the first time I went out for sushi in Toronto and, of course, went after checking out reviews on Yelp. Wow might be a bit of an overstatement, but it was definitely great sushi.

I needed a place to go because a cousin of mine was in town, so we were looking for a nice, cosy place for 3 and that's exactly what we got here. The place was pretty small, maybe 6-7 tables although I didn't take a proper look around, to be honest. 

We got a table as soon as we walked in, and were presented with miso soup and brown rice water immediately after we sat down. The menu was pretty extensive but we decided to keep it simple and stick to the a la carte sushi menu. Well, simple in terms of sticking to sushi but not so simple in terms of the sushi that we ordered. Between three people, we decided to order six rolls and go splitsies on all of them. We went with spicy tuna, Philadelphia, salmon & avocado and then three of their more special rolls: Japan go, global Leslie and rainbow. 

The simpler ones came out first and we all decided that the Philadelphia was probably the tastiest of the three. The cream cheese always does it. The more complicated rolls, of course, took longer to come out. The global Leslie was probably the least favourable from the three. The others were actually very good. 

Overall, comfortable environment, not very loud, great sushi and (I know this is biased) plus points for being very close to where I live."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi may have some of the freshest, and well-selected fish in the city.  A kind of dumpy hole-in-the-wall just off Yonge Street, don't let the decor and tiny size of the place fool you: there's some great sushi being served here.  Quality and price both outperform downtown favorite Japango, to which comparisons seem inevitable: the size of each piece of nigiri at both restaurants is a bit smaller than what I'd consider to be standard for Japan - which is to say it's tiny - and the emphasis is on high-impact flavor in tiny portions.

And that's where Wow Sushi truly succeeds.  Though I found the technical skills on display at Japango to be superior - Wow Sushi's cuts of fish were at times rougher and almost seemed kind of hacked away at - the fish is incredibly fresh, and the flavour is often remarkable.  Torched sea bream was perfectly prepared, with a sort of delightfully crisp texture to the exterior flesh and a bite of surprising saltiness.  Salmon was smooth and rich, oily enough to be flavourful but not overpowering.  The otoro was the best I've had in this city - though the cut was a bit rough, the translucent pink flesh was gorgeous, and the fish just melts the moment it hits your mouth, the flesh and oil blending into one.  I'm actually not a big fan of otoro, but freshness and quality at this level could easily make me a convert.  Maguro was blindingly fresh as well, the ruby color impeccable, the flesh delicate, and the flavour mild but appreciable.

The lunch sushi combo is a steal at twelve dollars for eight pieces of nigiri and a tiny eight-piece roll of spicy salmon and avocado.   Again, the small size wasn't a detractor here: the roll was packed with flavor, and despite being a pretty simple construct that was largely just filler the result was still tasty and memorable.  The throw-in could've been a lame AYCE-style California roll, a la Japango.  But it isn't, and I appreciated that.

The one disappointment was the Louis Maki, a tiny tempura shrimp roll each piece topped with spicy salmon, a sliver of jalapeno, mayo, and a dab of tobiko.  The presentation and care that was evident didn't really come together to create a memorable roll: it was a fun little bit of fluff amongst a sea of genuine gems, that might have been more interesting if it wasn't overshadowed by everything else going on around it.  At twelve bucks it felt like a cash grab aimed at those who didn't know better, and was the only item I sampled that didn't seem like an outstanding value.

While it's outpaced in my opinion by ND Sushi & Grill, I'll definitely be dropping in on Wow Sushi any time I'm in the area and looking for a great sushi lunch.  The fish here is stellar."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in a week. I think thats all I need to say."}
{"text":"The sushi and miso soup are excellent. Ramen is fine, but I like the mushroom inside."}
{"text":"4.5 Star almost perfect?

Back here for dinner. No more spoon in my miso soup and the side salad had just the perfect amount of dressing! (Thanks for reading my review!)

Sashimi Dinner so Fresh! Good and Interesting selection of fish. Love the raw oyster and the uni/oyster/roe shooter! The bowl of sushi rice was just perfect!

Japango Roll was over sauced. A more balance is needed but that should be easily adjust.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Update already? What had changed in a week's time?

Came back again with Lauren M and Chad M (the M & M?) for lunch. Same restaurant, same waitress, same lunch special order but a different Chef...

If I didn't have that Chirashi lunch last week, I would still be happy with what I got this time, but what a big difference!

Presentation was not as good. I know it is just a $13 Chirashi but one of the most important factor in Japanese cuisine is the presentation. This time my lunch is no longer a piece of art... more like just have all the fish dumped together on a plate and ask me to eat it.

Quality was not as good as the fish was not cut as well. I got the same kind of fish but just not done as well as last time.

Before I leave, I show the chef the photo I took of the Chirashi I had last week. Maybe I expecting too much? But I guess I was too spoiled last time and I just want a repeat experience!

I'll be back for Chirashi again, soon! I hope the 3rd time will be a charm..."}
{"text":"To date I have been to Wow Sushi twice and both times the meals were very good. It is a small establishment with maybe 8 tables inside, but it was full both times i went there, meaning the food must be good. 

Overall the sushi/sashimi platters were very fresh and the selection was good in a sense that nothing too strange was on the platter. The salad/miso soup were both great and the service was quite quick. They even brought us a free dish at the start which was extremely nice. 

For me it is not a destination spot to travel too, but definitely a good choice if you want sushi and are in the Yonge/Bloor area."}
{"text":"Price 4/5 - it ok. $30 for 2

Food 3/5 - too soft, soggy and watery. I never tried like these ones. weird!!!

Service 4/5 - nothing special. You have to pay at the registry. Place is super small! 

Will NOT be Back!"}
{"text":"Pretty wow-inducing sushi at this place. This pint-sized sushi spot is just up a short flight of stairs on Charles street, a few doors down from 7 West. It's warm and inviting, especially on my rainy-day visit. It's a decidedly cozy place and I would guess that it seats fewer than 30 people (ten along the bar, and the rest at two-tops throughout).

The menu is a bit confusing, which lots of named options. I opted for the sashimi plate and I was not disappointed. It was 18 pieces of really big and tasty morsels of fish. I wasn't too keen on the shrimp, but everything else was a knockout, really. 

Also worth mentioning that the service here was solid. I'd probably come back here and try the Chirashi plate everyone has been talking about.

Obligatory Title Pun: Enter the World of Wasabi (WoW).

Menu Readability: I remember only that it was big.

Need to mention: If you're a group larger than four, you'll need a reservation.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'd probably play a sushi-based MMORPG."}
{"text":"I would call myself a sushi lover, others refer to me as a sushi snob. So, I was naturally on the lookout for sushi as a neophyte Torontonian. We decided to go to Wow after reading many good reviews.

I ordered the sushi dinner for $22 (12 piece nigiri and 8 piece dynamite roll), which again isn't a bad size for its money. It's usually a bad move to order sets like this, unless you're doing omakase, but at an average price of $5-7 per 2 nigiri, my usual ordering pattern (3-6 types of nigiri + 1 maki) would have run a bloody gash in my wallet - I decided to risk it for the sake of saving money. Besides, there's a lot one can tell with an order like this.

The order came, nicely plated (not really a relevant issue for me), and the spread looked ok. Their fish was by and large fresh, with a sizable selection. This usually means better-than-average in my books (extra points for the effort at least). There was Salmon, Tuna, white tuna, Aji (Spanish mackerel), butter fish, and Madai (snapper), 2 pieces of each. The sushi was aburi style (torched) for the tunas and madai. The pieces were also dressed (e.g. green onions, garlic oil). 

The Rice:

Perhaps the most important but oft neglected part of sushi is the rice. Here. it was decently flavoured compared to other places I've been to in Toronto. Even compared to all the places I've been to in Vancouver, Hong Kong, Japan, the flavour here is good balance of salty, sweet, and vinegary. However, like so many places, the texture of the rice was sorely lacking. The rice had become crumbly, which is likely due to overcooling and excess evaporation (it was probably 8:30 pm). Thus the rice lost much of its chewy and toothy textures. Also, suboptimal (below body temperature) temperatures also affected the rice's aroma, taking away from the overall experience. A lot of this can be remedied by using a higher-quality rice. Since I don't think it's always a sustainable practice in restaurants, extra effort is needed to make up for this. 

The Fish:

The fish was fresh, so no complaints there. It wasn't overwhelming fresh, either, so no extra points. I liked their variety and their aburi. Sadly, I think the sushi suffered from a size issue. The fish was sliced fairly thin, to a point where it compromised the flavour of the fish slightly. The fish to rice ratio was still good (in general smaller pieces), but with the aburi and dressing, the flavour of the fish was somewhat lost. Slices that are a touch thicker would have made this a strength instead of a flaw. Oh, they used pickled ginger on the Aji instead of grated normal ginger - NEVER do this. The sugariness drowns out everything. The Madai was nice, albeit a bit over torched. That being said I could still taste the fish and it was pretty good. Plus, the heating added a new flavour to an otherwise standard piece of tai. The over torching may have made it a bit too smoky though.

The Others:

I am a fan of nigiri. Maki sushi is secondary in my books, so I don't focus on that too much. I would have to say that the dynamite roll was well done. The cucumber was English long, and in strips, both of which I don't care for, but the shrimp was of good quality and well-fried. All in all, the roll was a win. We also ordered grilled eggplant and agedashi tofu, both of which were satisfying. The tofu was fried without batter, so it development a chewy skin (cool variation), and the eggplant was grilled, peeled and served in a dashi shoyu concoction (actually just the agedashi broth). You can still taste the grilling in the soupy dashi broth, which was a nice contrast.

Overall:

Wow sushi has got some good things, and the prices for certain items are very reasonable. This is not meant to be an indictment, but I would rate Wow as a mid-high level tier 2 sushi place in my ranking system (tier 1 sushi places have to make no consistent glaring mistakes, and have a good selection of fresh fish). I recommend it, and would definitely come back (still need to try tamago and some simple maki's), perhaps at an earlier hour to see if some of the rice texture issues go away for me. I'd give this place as 3.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me do that."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of Yelp gave it good reviews.  And this place was great!  I ordered the Sashimi Dinner which was very nice, reasonably price but it didn't fill me. 

This place had a variety of sushi options, and i would definitely go there again.  The staff didn't seem very knowledgeable but the food was amazing.  

definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about Wow Sushi from Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike, so when I was in the area I decided to give it a try. I didn't expect a small restaurant when I walked in. I took off my coat to reveal my ?????? attire, the menu, a cup of water, and miso soup were already served.

I ordered the chirashi dinner after a recommendation from a friend, and started drinking the miso soup. Yum! Not like other miso soups I've tasted, definitely a lot more flavorful. The service was extremely quick, the chirashi and salad arrived before I finished the miso soup. Similarly, the salad was better than at other places. The sauce that it comes in was not too sweet, which I appreciate.

The chirashi looked odd. I usually see chirashi served in a bowl. This was more like slices of fish around a mound of rice. All the same ingredients, just a different presentation. I liked the yellow flower that they added, so pretty :). I started to dig in, fish after fish. \"Wow\" I thought to myself, as the restaurant's name implied (though the menu says that the name is \"wa\", which means peace). The salmon was one of my favorites, it was simply more flavorful and I could taste the sweetness of the fish more so than any other places I've had salmon sashimi. I really liked the charred skin on one of the fish, the butterfish and seared tuna were also excellent. I'm not a fan of seaweed salad, but the seaweed was really good. I saved my favorite for last, the uni, which was sitting on a lime wedge the whole time. It simply melted in my mouth and had that citrus note to it that made it so sublime. My mouth is watering just writing this review.

Would I come back? You bet!"}
{"text":"Chose this spot based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint! 

We walked in an hour before closing on a Tuesday night, and were greeted immediately by every single member of the visible staff (it's a small, hole-in-the-wall place). Within seconds of becoming comfortable in our seats (which were available immediately) warm green tea arrived, followed minutes later by fresh miso soup. 

Our waitress was very friendly and answered our questions with an understanding smile. I ordered a dragon roll as well as a California roll (boring, I know) and my date ordered the $26 Sashimi dinner, which is 18 pieces of fresh fish organized in a very interesting display (I'll attach a photo). My food was delicious, - rice perfectly sticky enough, still nice and cool, cucumbers crunchy to the bite indicating freshness, eel perfectly tasty, avocado fresh and ripe. His, he tells me, was also amazing. 

If I lived in Toronto, this would definitely be my go-to spot for satisfying a sushi fix."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, the first time I only ordered take-out. All I can say is that the place really lives up to its name. It is truly WOW. We had the cod, japango roll, sushi dinner, unaju and house sake."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area, authentically made by the Japanese chefs.
The fish is so fresh and nicely marinaded so it's full of flavour. 
We usually get a medium boat for two of us."}
{"text":"This is the second location in the GTA. I used to frequent the young/bloor location when we lived downtown. So I was excited to find out they opened the second location in Markham.
We went for lunch today. Lunch menu is very good value. $7 for 2 rolls (simpler rolls, of course not the specialty ones) and miso soup. Lunch boxes came with soup and salad. We had 4 rolls (California, tempura, spicy salmon, and Boston) and a salmon lover lunch special to share between 2 of us. We were both stuff. Agedashi tofu was delish; fresh warm and flavourful. 
Overall, sushi was fresh and good value for lunch. I have to come back to try their specialty rolls so I can compare it with the downtown location."}
{"text":"I think this is a hidden gem around bloor yonge area. It's a small little place in an old part of a house but the sushi is fresh and delicious. Each time I've come here, the sashimi and sushi just melt in my mouth. There is construction around the Charles St &Yonge intersection so it makes this even easier to miss. Their lunch menu is great for its price but dinner isnt bad either. Miso soup is also complementary when you come by. It might be more difficult to get a larger party here though"}
{"text":"Great experience having dinner here. They served miso soup and salad as soon as we got seated. Excellent service and great food! Chicken Teriyaki was very tasty and tender and sushi was fresh. I am really glad we found this place during our visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I love sushi - if forced to choose one cuisine I had to live on everyday of my life, sushi would be it.  Wow is the best I've been able to find in the city thus far.  The quality and freshness of the fish is outstanding.  I still am searching for a place that can come close the sushi of Vancouver but until then, Wow is on top."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed at this place, came here because saw the 4 stars on yelp, the rolls r small in size because they are cut into 8 pieces when at other restaurant it is normally cut into 6 pieces. The orange sauce they put on the rolls taste like mayo mix with spicy oil sauce, which doesnt go with sushi. All you can eat places have better quality."}
{"text":"Food was worth the price. Servers constantly refilled my glass of water and I didn't have to ask them to. The place is small and feels cramped though."}
{"text":"I ordered an Unagi Don to go. It's tasty and a good amount of portion. Went to the place after 20 mins and my order was ready and warm. P.s. It's not spacious."}
{"text":"Came to try out this place since it has been so highly reviewed on yelp. Not sure if there is a recent change in ownership or what, my experience was disappointing. 

I have chosen one of the higher price point item on their lunch menu- the sashimi don lunch combo and was greatly disappointed. First off I have inquired the server when deciding between the chirashi don and sashimi don, server was not able to tell me what kind of fish will be served from either but she did suggest the sashimi don will serve the higher quality fish.

When my dish came, it was simply a bed of miscellaneous diced up seafood on a bed of WARM rice. Other than salmon was in that mix, there were only tamago (sweetened-egg), tofu, imitation crab meat and seaweed. 

Upon some observations, sushi chefs mostly do not handle food hygienically, and it seems that the restaurants are owned by a group of Chinese or at least they have all Chinese employees which most are not very knowledgable."}
{"text":"Nothing \"WOW\" here. Small, unfresh sushi rolls. Service was friendly and that is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Really expensive for what you actually get."}
{"text":"Love it! 

Goal: To make it on their chopstick wall for regulars...

ATMOSPHERE: Very small, authentic and bustling with activity. It's as small as Japango. Maybe even smaller. So either make reservations, or swing by earlier part of dinner service to make sure you get a table!

Located near Yorkville, just behind the TD Manulife Centre building - it's great for those catching a film at the Varsity, or just before/after shopping. With a place like this, why would you go to the likes of Sushi Inn?

SERVICE: Excellent. Very attentive. Drinks were refilled regularly.

PRICE: Moderate. It's not cheap, but not astronomical either that it's only for those once-a-year special occasions.

FOOD: Fantastic! I always believe the best test for quality at a Japanese restaurant is the sashimi. Y'gotta try the basics and see if they've got it. If they pass the Sashimi Test, then I'm confident to try other things, or know that I'll be back for more. Having said that, Wow!, has some of the BEST sashimi I've ever had in Toronto. Super fresh. I've had the Sashimi Dinner a few times now, and it has been so. I also love that you can taste distinctly that each fish is different - which is not the case for all restaurants. 

At most average Japanese restaurants, the salmon is the most flavourful fish. But I find at top notch joints like this one? Salmon was the least interesting - because everything else on the plate was THAT exceptional.

Also, the quality of food and the presentation has been very consistent from visit to visit.

Really want to come back and try their omakase, sometime. Priced at $60, it's actually quite reasonable compared to other authentic shops."}
{"text":"Quality sashimi, very friendly service, but small servings and cramped venue. Wow Sushi gets a 3.5 star overall. 

We ordered the sashimi dinner, karaage, and eel avocado roll. I enjoyed the sashimi freshness and the chef's selection but wished that the serving size was larger. The karaage was tasty but not authentic. It was basically popcorn chicken rather than actual chicken  pieces. Lastly the eel avocado roll was delicious but again small serving size so we ordered another plate. 

Meanwhile, service was very friendly and prompt. Probably because it's such a tiny, cramped restaurant. 

Overall, the price point is a bit higher than average, but the quality is arguably better. I feel that this place is missing personality to justify eating here again. Perhaps if they made their serving sizes larger and renovated the venue to be more classy, then this place could be at least a 4 star."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best sushi joints in the city. 

The whole restaurant is smaller than my family room yet it is authentic as it gets. The salmon, butterfish and tuna sashimi is perfect. I tend to get the Chirashi lunch special (assorted fish served on a bed of sushi rice) for $13 and it hits the spot every time. Even the rice is amazing. 

Never had a disappointing meal here."}
{"text":"I only ever ordered sashimi and sushi here and they were pretty good. But the miso soup was merely fine and the place is really narrow so its bad for big gathering."}
{"text":"I heard blogger friends say this place was ok so we decidedvto try it.  The space is really tiny.  The sushi was ok but nothing special. The 2 young Asian servers seemed half asleep though and scrwed up our service a couple of times.  I doubt inwill return becausevthere are so many better places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I didn't expect to love this place so much! 

It's a very small place, with maybe 8 tables??

They made TWO mistakes on us -which probably explains why they treated us extremely well. The important part is that they made up for it!! THANK YOU!!!!

We ordered the ikura (salmon roe) sushi with quail egg. This is just regular ikura sushi, but they crack a quail egg right in the center. It's really different, but since I love ikura (A LOT) I'd be okay without the quail egg.

The nabe yaki udon is seafood yaki udon, but the seafood wasn't very special: crab meat, shrimp tempura, one scallop, one piece of (really fresh) cooked fish. The soup was amazing and the udon is the good kind (not soggy, doesn't break apart). Served in a large stone bowl!

Spicy scallop sushi roll: OMG THIS WAS SOO AMAZING, and VERY SPICY. 

Japango roll is just California roll but with cooked salmon, scallop, and fish eggs on top. This was pretty amazing too actually, and very filling with the salmon.

In total, the meal for two was $42 (with tax, before tips). I thoroughly enjoyed the food here (especially that spicy scallop). 

=========OUR STORY WITH THEIR 2 MISTAKES:
They gave us ikura sushi (2pcs) instead of ikura with quail egg. We thought the egg was going to be inside the sushi or something.... so we ate one. Oh. It's not there (lol) so we returned it. They remade the remaining sushi with the quail egg, but they gave us 2 uni sushi (sea urchin) \"on the house\" (the chefs said that) -very yummmmmyyyy.

After finishing our food, we overheard the chef's yelling in Japanese something about JAPANGO. And something like \"okay we'll make it now.\" YEP, it's ours. They forgot to make it.... At the end of our meal, they offered ice cream \"on the house.\" 

Thanks Wow! Sushi!!!!!!!!!!!! We were definitely WOW'D by your service!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day.  Quick and simple. Better than most of the places in this area.  I heard good things about this place, so may have to check back for dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place off Markham Road (near the Costco).

Definitely way above average quality and service than typical sushi places, especially around this area.

Have come here multiple times since opening, prices are great and food quality is superb!"}
{"text":"This will be probably mt one of sushi restaurant.
I always looking forward fresh sushi. 
Now , Finally i founded.
I got Sushi Dinner(25cad).
It was 8pics shrimp fried roll and various sushi.
But i recommend to go Lunch time (until 3pm)
It's better. (Becouse you can eat more cheap!)"}
{"text":"Was looking primarily for an a la carte sushi resto to satisfy my 9 month absence from spicy salmon sushi, my fave roll, but unfortunately their version of it just did not satisfy my taste buds the way I expected and excitedly anticipated. The rest of my order which I believe was a salmon dish just did not leave a lasting impression and for this reason I am giving a 3. Service was good but probably never coming back."}
{"text":"Wow Sushi is located a bit off Yonge St, south of Yorkville. I've been twice for lunch and I would suggest arriving a bit before noon if you want to guarantee getting a seat. The inside is fairly narrow and dark but feels nice and cozy. 

I've had really fresh fish both times and service was attentive. A typical lunch will set you back around $15-$20."}
