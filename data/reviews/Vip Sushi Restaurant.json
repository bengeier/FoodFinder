{"text":"Buried in a strip mall in Thornhill, this place is hard to find. But don't let its  location discourage you; the food here is definitely top notch sushi, probably some of the best I have ever tried. Not to mention, this place is all-u-can-eat. But wait! Don't stuff your face just yet. The food you'll be eating is not thrown together like the boxes of sushi that they serve at the grocery, but it's actually quality, authentic  cuisine. And if you don't finish what you order, you will be charged, no joke.  For my appetizer, I had the miso soup, which is delicious in every way. The consistency is nice and smooth, and the dashi flavor is present without being too strong. For the entree, I had the dragon roll, which is just outstanding. The ingredients are fresh and the tempura inside is cooked to perfection.  I haven't been here in a year, so I don't remember the fine points, but I'll write a follow up review the next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of sushi until I tried this place. The food was great and the all you can eat menu was quite large. Very affordable and great service."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat sushi place with a few twists. 1. A much better menu on Weekends (more expensive) 2. Within that better menu items that you can only order once, not AYCE. 3. If you leave anything you will be charged extra. 4. You have a 2 hour limit on the AYCE.  The outside is distinctly understated. Inside it is a pleasant environment with nice soji  screen divider that are quite attractive. You can see the sushi making from pretty well anywhere in the restaurant.  The food is fresh, but not of the greatest quality. We ate there on a weekday and our options were limited. The sashimi was fresh and tasty, but limited. The seaweed salad was truly second rate. A fish roe salad consisted of a mayo dressing on head lettuce that had a little fish roe worked into it. Not very tasty.  Overall all the sushi offering including the hand rolls had a bit too much rice, which was 'clumpier' that it should be.  For dessert you are also limited to one scoop of ice cream. All these limitations are probably due to the price which is a couple of dollars less than my 'gold standard' Maison du Japon.   Overall this would have been OK for lunch but for dinner I will be returning to Maison du Japon."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place a lot, but I stopped a while ago because of the limits - the length of time you can sit a table, how much sashimi you can order, ect.  These limits really started to annoy some of my friends and for that reason we started going somewhere else.  Their food is all right, but there are other restaurants that are definitely better."}
