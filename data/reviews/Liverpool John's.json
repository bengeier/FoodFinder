{"text":"It was my first visit to Liverpool Johns and I will likely return. They had some pretty great specials on: $16.00 for ribs & wings with fries and slaw and less than $5 for their Liverpool John's draught. Cons: Service was a slow (considering it wasn't too busy) & nachos came out cold."}
{"text":"Great food, staff, prices and perfect beer pours! My Go-to spot in the east end! Menu has a ton of choices and with 3 floors there is choice in what kind of seating you prefer"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. We were greeted right away, server was very attentive and the drinks were good quality as well as the food. Clean and lots of tvs to watch the games."}
{"text":"Delicious food !!! A large menu with a wide selection and a very friendly owner. There is a room at the front with a pool table that you can eat in and it is kind of like your own personal room which is nice. The service is always fast and friendly. Apparently this place is haunted too."}
{"text":"We went on a  Saturday evening and had a difficult time to decide what to get. The menu offers a great variety of food. Burgers, poutine, sandwiches, salads, a few typical British/Irish dishes (I think), pasta, soups and quite a few other selections. We had some poutine, a burger and two little yorkies.  Everything was tasty! Even the poutine. I also had some sweet potato fries and it was perfect. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside instead of soggy.  Service was nice and the atmosphere pleasant.  We will definitely come back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Sadly this place did not do anything special for me. It's pretty much the same bar as before, just different pictures on the wall. I  feel like this space should be turned into Keg.  My girlfriend and I came for wings, and noticed a deep fried hair ball attached to them. Thankfully the manager did take them off my bill.   This building is beautiful it's sad to see it jump from bar to another bar"}
{"text":"Liverpool John's is close to home and I've seen several restaurants open and close in this space over the years. It's not a bad location so I don't know they don't seem to last.  I drive by all the time and they seem to be busy most of the time. Today, however, a Sunday afternoon, they were very quiet, in more ways than one. There were very few customers and the music was intermittent, leaving lots of very quiet periods.  There is lots of seating in this place, spread over three floors, an enclosed patio, and an outdoor patio. I saw a pool table on the ground level but I didn't exoplore the other floors. They have TVs all over the place, showing all kinds of sports. They even have TVs mounted in the windows facing the parking lot.  Their menu has a lot of the usual pub favourites - wings, nachos, burgers, etc. There's a whole section of poutine, curry chicken, butter chicken, and some other atypical pub grub. One item caught my attention almost right away - Rack of Lamb for only $18.00. That's it!  The lamb was more chops than a rack, even though they were Frenched. I really wasn't expecting a standing rack for that price. It was cooked much closer to well done than I would have preferred but the flavour was good, with rosemary and mushrooms in a red wine sauce. I had asked for a side Caesar salad and they were able to accommodate my request at a special price, no problem.  The food, service, and value were all good enough to contemplate a future visit. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my niece.  I thought it was going to be a normal pub food but they actually have a great selection of meals to choose from.  I had the grilled veggie wrap and my niece had the bangers and mash.  We both enjoyed our meals.  Also the price is reasonable for a sit down restaurant.  I would come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and had a great time. The food is great and at a good price. They even have their own house beer and they have a dance floor on the lower level with a live dj. A great place for a night out"}
