{"text":"After reading the reviews I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a beer. Staff was great very friendly especially Christy. Food was good you should  try the California burger, cooked to perfection. I don't know why everyone is complaining must be associated with the previous establishment.  Yes I ride, but I was welcomed with the same hospitality as everyone one else dressed in suits. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Terrible service was so so seemed like they were under new management. Everyone I talked in there was unhappy. We had plenty of time to talk because service was non existent."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fun, easy going, great patio!  Exactly what this area needs. Girl day before the spent training game!!! So fun!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Only been here once thus far but can't wait to come back - such a great looking menu. Zipps FINALLY has some competition in Scottsdale in terms of a sports bar with great bar food. Also is a great open air bar with TVs, friendly staff etc. Try this place, trust me!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Kimmyz today. The service was good, food was pretty good too. This place is great if you're a smoker.... the whole patio was filled with people lighting up and the breeze wasn't strong enough to move the smoke out. We ate quickly and left."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday, someone posted they had good fish and chips - not so, not even on menu :(.  Since I was there checked out menu, nothing to write home about.  Service was terrible, waited and waited, looks like a place like the TV show \"Cheers\", the staff know the regulars and if you're a newbie, you're SOL."}
{"text":"Nice environment for sports, lots of TV's. Food was meh. Bland meatloaf/mashedngravy, canned corn. Ribeye had a funky flavor to it and veggies were old. Loaded baked potato was good and so was the fried shrooms and onion rings."}
{"text":"Kimmyz 3rd location.  As expected.... great food, drinks & service!  Keep on growing Kim!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Using the online ordering link from their website, I ordered the 12 Jumbo-sized Wings for lunch. I love it when restaurants offer online ordering.  My order was hot and ready when I arrived to pick it up.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The wings were delicious and crispy but really small and not much meat.  I'm giving 3 stars because the menu said Jumbo-sized so I was disappointed to see such small chicken wings.  The wings were even smaller than those offered by the surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"The servers were very nice and attentive. The food (meat) was less than ideal. My teenage son's burger was very rare and he had already eaten half of it when I came back from the bar to get some honey mustard for my chicken (which they charged me 59 cents for). I probably should have sent it back if he didn't devour it. My chicken sandwich was very chewy and muscly tasting. Yuk, not tender at all. I didn't eat it all. The fries and tater tots were wonderful. The prices were ok 8.99 for burger and fries or chicken. Oh well"}
{"text":"Threw a small impromptu birthday party at Kimmyz and we all enjoyed the food and the service was excellent. For a party of 5 our food and drinks were less than $70.    I really liked the layout and how clean the restaurant was.  We will be back to try out the daily specials.   Easy access off 101 a bonus!"}
{"text":"Love the new location great atmosphere....The Staff is always incredible very friendly and love seeing the owner Kimmy in her locations ...an owners presents makes a huge difference. Kimmy great job!"}
{"text":"Its got pretty good food. Don't get me wrong i'm giving 4 stars based on the fact I know what to expect. I have had it a few times for lunch and its better than most things around here. If anyone is coming here with the expectations of having food that is going to change how you look at your life then you are going to be disappointed. Its got decent food and is priced accordingly. Im not sure what other people were expecting when they walked in. I used to go when it was Ventura Grill and I believe it is better now. Also for people who are giving one star because people in there have tattoos, grow up and get off your high horse."}
{"text":"Nice people.  Good food and drinks. Convenient to the freeway, baseball and the Aquarium.  I've even seen families with kids.   Nice patio."}
