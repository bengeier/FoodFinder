{"text":"The food is very authentic, especially the hotpot soup and fried rice. And I really like the sauce station that allows you to mix your own special sauce. It is specious and well decorated inside. But I took the two stars away. I understand it is a self-service restaurant. However, it's kind of messy when crowed with people. If I have not tried hotpot and didn't fall in love with it, I would hesitate to walk in. And I was quite shocked when I walked to the counter and found a cleaning cloth on my tray. I guess the server just walked away and left it on my tray. And the air there really hurt my eyes. I don't know if the extractor hoods don't work well or what. I had really uncomfortable eyes after eating there. I expect the restaurant gets better cos I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"We ordered Spicy Tang, and the food has no other flavors but spicy taste. It is really hard to make bad taste of Spicy Tang. I would not   Recommend this place."}
{"text":"EDIT: It appears that the restaurant owners (or somebody else affiliated with the business) have taken to writing fake shill reviews in a pathetic attempt to manipulate their overall rating. Notice that all of the 5-star reviews are by users with only 1 or 2 reviews. They probably gave one another most of their useful/funny/cool votes. In fact, Gabrielle Y.'s original review was removed by the Yelp admin, but a new one was posted IMMEDIATELY (literally within a few minutes). I urge my fellow Yelpers to read everything carefully and decide for yourself which ones to trust.

My original review is below:
--
Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. My fiancée and I had been excited about coming here since we first saw the signage outside last month, and we finally came today (a Saturday), around 11:30 AM. The first thing we noticed is how disorganized the place is; they were busy training a new employee and none of the others was dealing with the line of customers waiting to order. The place wasn't super busy, maybe a dozen people eating and 4 others in line ahead of us.

The way this place works: ingredients are separated into meats (which include fish, shrimp, etc.), vegetables, and \"mixed meats\" (fish balls and quail eggs). You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice. Meats are $2 each, vegetables $1, mixed meats $1.50. While the concept is fine, the poor organization here means ordering is very inefficient. The staff are Chinese and so are we, but they didn't know the names of several items we asked for. I imagine it would be even more confusing for English speakers. They don't have a large quantity of the ingredients on the counter, so they are constantly running out of things and running to replace with a new batch. They also failed to keep track of what ingredients we ordered, and we had to help them add it up. All in all, ordering was a messy ordeal and I don't want to imagine how they handle the crowds during busier times. 

Personally, I think they should let customers fill their own bowl and pay by weight (like most similar places in China), or a fixed price per bowl (like the Mongolian grill type places in America). By charging different prices for different ingredients they may be squeezing out better profit margins, but at the cost of poor operating efficiency. I also think they should call your number and have you pick up your order at the counter, rather than trying to bring it to your table, which they can't find and end up constantly calling out numbers anyways. At the very least, they should let customers get their own chopsticks, napkins, and cups of water - it's yet another extra burden on the already disorganized staff. 

We asked for \"slightly spicy\" broth but what we got lit our mouths on fire. I don't know if they misheard or just don't have anything less spicy, but keep that in mind. They don't give you white rice, so make sure you order enough for the soup. My tongue was completely numb so I can't comment much about how the food tastes. But my fiancée had stomach cramps during the drive back home, and ended up getting sick. 

Overall, it seems that the owners didn't do sufficient preparation before opening the restaurant. They should have had the staff properly trained and rethought their operation procedures. As of right now, the place is a complete mess, which is a bad sign for a place that just opened and should have had things planned out. I won't come back because of the food poisoning, but in any case I would urge them to consider adopting the self-serve model of several other nearby eateries (Spoon House, Sushi Ichiban, etc.). It would significantly speed things up while not adding to their costs.

{"text":"TLDR: DONT GO! It's a FRAUD!!!
I registered Yelp for writing this. It reads 10.99 per lbs. I saw mine weighed 9oz and it cost me freaking 19 bucks. The cashier speaks little English."}
{"text":"Food taste= spicy only with no other flavors
Food amount= e.g for two dollars, you are getting only three pieces of frozen sliced beef. No rice provided 
Food diversity= very limited. 
Food quality= not sure if the food was fresh or cooked appropriately, but my stomach was not happy after the meal
Service= unorganized, not just a little bit

I noticed that there are three positive reviews came out the same day same hour, and I think as a true customer, I should write a real review here to let people know. I hope the owner of Spicy Tang will take care of their business more seriously!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The only problem is the price. I'm from China so I know this dish is usually among the cheapest Chinese food. But it's kind of expensive here compared with other Chinese food."}
{"text":"Could've given 0 stars if I could, or negative infinity. I placed an order to go, received a buzzer that never vibrated, so I questioned a staff on the progress of my order after a 1 full hour wait. They told me that they handed my food to another customer, and there's nothing they could do at this point. That's the end of the story. I never received my food. 

I was told that I could repick my 2.5 lbs worth of food items across 20 categories, and wait again. Or go to my afternoon classes hungry, and receive a refund. I chose the later. The refund process was not satisfying either. They could not locate my credit card transaction in their system, handed me an approximate amount in cash, and compensated my misfortune with a $2 coupon, which I rejected kindly, telling them that there wouldn't be a need for it since I will not return to this mess again. 

Going to my class hungry now, but a lesson learned."}
{"text":"It is very pricy specially when you didn't pay attention and got too much iced stuffs. But tastes ok, the spicy tomato soup is not bad. But just too pricy for that small bowl"}
{"text":"Disappointing  bland  slow  service  high  prices? never  come  back  for the fake spicy tang?damnnn!!"}
{"text":"Despite the not so great reviews, I gave this place a try, and I loved it! Had the beef noodle and it was great! Good price for a ton of food. Beef was really tender. Will come back to try their spicy tang stuff."}
{"text":"I have been there several times, and I really like the food in spicy tang. The new spicy stir fried in this restaurant is very delicious and spicy. This restaurant is very characterize, because we can choose the food by ourselves. The service in this restaurant is very good, they serve the food for us and we do not need to clean the table after we finished. I also recommend you to try the daily special in this restaurant since they change the menu everyday."}
{"text":"Very authentic \"mala\" (Sichuan spice) flavor, but only if you ask for extra spicy. The \"mala\" pot is the way to go and a great reminder of the flavors of my home town, which is hard to find on campus.

Try them out if you like hot and spicy food, try something new, and want to try some authentic Chinese \"mala\" flavor.

Oh, and I'm from Sichuan, China :)

????????????????\"??\"???????????????????????????????

??????????????????????"}
{"text":"AVOID THE PLACE!!! You have to pick up at least 1 lb for the spicy bowl, and it is way toooooo overpriced. There is almost no flavor of the soup and the raw ingredients are soooo bad!  They won't tell you that you have to get more than enough until you check out, and you have to go back to the end of the line to pick more stuff so that they allow you to check out. There is no waiter, and the cashier has no idea what he is doing."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch earlier this week and I actually really liked it. We walk in and there is 2 bowl sizes to choose from. You pick whatever items you want and put it in the bowl. They have an assortment of fishballs, meats, and noodles that you can add to your bowl. Once you get to the register, you put your bowl on a scale, choose from 4 different soup bases and pay ($10.99/lb). My bowl was just under a pound. They take the food that you picked and cook it in the soup base that you chose. You then receive a buzzer and you seat yourself. During busy hours, it gets pretty packed but we were lucky enough to find seating. The bowl that you get is a soup with all the ingredients in it. It is almost like Boiling Point if anyone has been there or a precooked hot pot. Your order comes with rice if you ask and overall I really enjoyed the taste, speed, and quality of the food. 

I wouldn't recommend taking this togo. The store is big but it gets crowded so seating is limited. Also, the raw items that you can choose from are not labeled so people who have never seen some of these foods might get confused. And for those reasons, I took off a star."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had. The pepper broth was so overpowering I couldn't eat more than a few spoonfuls."}
{"text":"To summarize, I have to agree with the person who wrote the first review. I saw their ads a few months ago and was very excited. My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. 

First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.

Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.

I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week and was very confused on what to do. I grabbed a bowl and started filling it up with the limited options that were presented. Nothing was labeled and they had very little vegetables. When I got my bowl weighed I was shocked to hear it was $15 since I only got tofu, ramen, spinach, and mushroom! My friends total came out to be $25 even more ridiculous! They give you an option of broth or having it stir fries and I chose broth which was a mistake. The broth was spicy but it didn't mix well at all with the ingredients I had chosen. My friend got stir fry and wasn't a huge fan because again, they didn't have a wide variety of ingredients to pick from. The only reason I'd ever come back here is if they increase their topping options."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Over priced and has a 2lb minimum for stir fries. No choice for stir fry sauces either. The stir fry was so oily that it was impossible to eat it. We left our 2.5lb meal on the table and just walked out."}
{"text":"I went to spicy tang a while and just got the chance to write the review. I like the many choices of small hotspots flavors. I was surprised that they even have non-spicy options such as bone soup and tomato soup. Sides are also very good. If you like Chinese food or spicy food, this is a definitely a place to go around the area."}
{"text":"I was craving some warm and spicy food in this cold Illinois winter. So my boyfriend and I went to Spicy Tang for the first time and the food was way beyond our expectations!!!!! 
Since I was starving, I got both the Hot Pot and the Spicy Stir Fried (????). There was a variety of veggies and meat available for us to choose from and the ingredients were all very fresh. We had a medium hot pot with tonkotsu broth. The food was decent. The sesame sauce was the best part of the Hot pot!
I love the Spicy Stir Fried even more!!! I'd say it definitely tasted much better than what we had in EVO and is probably the best spicy stir fried on campus. It was authentic, delicious, and just the right amount of spicy! I will definitely come back for more of that. Nom Nom Nom!!!
The service was also wonderful. With the cashier's help, it was easy for us to figure out what to order the first time we went. We didn't wait long to get our food either. All in all, it was a wonderful and satisfying experience for us and the price was decent. Keep it up, Spicy Tang!"}
{"text":"I think this is the first authentic Chinese stir fry place on campus. A friend introduced me to Spicy Tang about a week after it opened, and I absolutely loved it. You select your ingredients -- meats, veggies, and noodles -- and put them in a bowl for the cooks to prepare in whichever style you specify. You'll have to order at least 2 pounds of ingredients, which is about $24, so I suggest you try this place with a group of friends... or by yourself if you're hungry enough. You can always put the leftovers in a takeout container if you can't finish it.

Unfortunately, I see a lot of negative reviews for this restaurant and I think it stems for some misguided expectations. Spicy Tang isn't a fast food restaurant and it does get crowded during peak hours, which is the case for a lot of restaurants. For the best experience, I suggest you get a group of friends and try this place with an open mind."}
{"text":"This is quite an excellent Chinese soup place. Overall I give it 3.5 stars when compared to food everywhere and 4 stars for a place on campus town. 

The concept is essentially pick your own ingredients and soup stock and they make a single serving of personalized hot pot for you. They have non-spicy fish stock for you people with cats tongues."}
{"text":"The menu is so confusing. It's on the wall. When I walked in, i had no clue how to order my food. I walked to the register and asked the cashier. Basically you just pick the raw ingredients you want and put them in a bowl and they charge you by weight. After that, choose a broth. They charge extra for the broth. I had the spicy broth 4$. And it came out very plain. I didn't like the flavor. And it was  overpriced."}
{"text":"I was visiting UIUC and wanted to try something new. What sparked my interest is basically it's create your own type of noodle shop. You get to pick what you want and what you want to put in. It cost $10.99 per pound which is a little pricy. You get to pick the soup broth you want out of 5 choices (some spicy and some non), the taste was disspointing nothing that stood out in flavor or spices. Overall the idea and concept was creative nothing about the food blew me away."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst taste ever. I think the food ingredients have expired. I will report the restaurant if I get food poisoning later, and I am sure this restaurant will shut down soon."}
{"text":"I love ma la tang and was really excited when I found this place. They have a pretty large selection of meats, veggies and noodles to choose from. There's also a good selection of soup bases to try. My favorite is their Tom yum soup. 
I'm giving this place 2 stars because (1) it's pretty pricey for what the restaurant is offering and haven't been able to try the dry stir fry by myself since you have to buy 2 pounds worth of food at about $10.99/lb I believe. And (2) the owner can be a bit rude at times. They offer 10% off if you check in on yelp and was refused every time because the owner said they \"forgot to take it off\" ?
The food itself is not bad but some of the soup bases can either be pretty bland or so spicy that you'll have to bring milk with you when you eat here.
Overall, if you're having a craving for ma la tang then this can give you a quick fix!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy stir fry. The lady at the counter didn't speak much English but nonetheless was very nice, and the owner told me that they do not use MSG (a rarity for any Chinese restaurant)! My food arrived in a cute black pot with a plate of white rice. However, my rice was ice cold, and the stir fry was lukewarm. While the stir fry's flavor was good, the vegetables were undercooked. This place could do very well, they just need to cook the food through and serve it hot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, expired - tasting ingredients, and tragic flavors. It's an ideal place for you to take your boy/girlfriend if you wanna breakup and hate each other for every second in the rest of your life."}
{"text":"awesome food and friendly service. i ve tried quite a lot and spicy tang is really good."}
{"text":"For those who want a quick review: I liked what I got (the beef and noodle soup), and I'll most likely come back at least once more.

For those who want more detail in a review: I came here on a whim to try something new. I got a tiny bit anxious when I saw no menu displayed anywhere, but the staff at the counter was kind and gave a small brochure menu that had  pictures on it of the pre-made orders (you could also make your own - cost was determined by how many items you put in it) and gave me his recommended item - the beef and noodle soup. Since I had no preconceived idea of what I wanted and I figured something basic would tell me a decent amount about their food quality and preparation, I decided to order just that.

It didn't take that long for the soup to arrive, but it wasn't that busy when I had ordered, though a decent amount of people came in after me- not too many that it got crowded, but enough to tell me that this wasn't a place that got few customers. But I digress. The presentation was kind of unique - it came in a black pot/kettle with chopsticks, a fork for those not comfortable with the chopsticks, and what I think is a broth spoon . I thought it tasted quite good by itself. I added some spicy taro to it and I liked it better that way, but that's a personal preference. 

I finished it all, full and satisfied. Admittedly, it was a bit more than I would have liked to pay (9.40 is what I paid), but I had a good enough time and enjoyed what I had that I can deal with it. When I come back again, I'll try one of the custom dishes and see if that's any good, and if I remember, update this review."}
{"text":"They use fresh materials for all of their dishes. The spicy stir fry (????) is especially good compared to other places in Champaign-Urbana area. If you like spicy Chinese food, you should come. The one thing that I don't like about this place is that the wait time is always long during lunch time."}
{"text":"There was honestly nothing special about this place..unless if you've never had this type of cuisine before. First of all, it's way overpriced. This place works by putting various raw ingredients into a bowl, where they weigh it at the end of the line (meat, veggies, fishballs, noodles). Being me, I decided to weigh the bowl first, which came out to a quarter lb (that's almost $2.50 right there). I then got my ingredients, there is a decent variety, I'll admit. But then again, it's not too hard to buy raw ingredients. There were no labels, so you kinda had to use intuition for some of the items. There were about 5 soup bases, they were eh (yellow curry I think? was not appealing to me). Asides from the price..expect over $16, there were also limited sauces, and once again with no labels. (Don't get me wrong, I'm Chinese, but a lot of my friends struggled)."}
{"text":"Asked for wild spicy, the host is very impatience. Told us there is no way to do so. Neither take or go. Unhappy experience."}
