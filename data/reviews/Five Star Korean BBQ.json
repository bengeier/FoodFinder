{"text":"Best Korean food in Madison, hands down! Madison was in dire need of some legit Korean food. I wish they had cooking at the table, but was told they are adding that. So stay tuned??! The kimichi is bomb. The galbi is sweet and perfectly tender.  Love the hostess/waitress too. Sweet korean lady who seems like she could be your mom or grandmother. Would def recommend."}
{"text":"Worst korean bbq I've ever been to:

- Not all you can eat
- Flies were everywhere
- Waitress consistently pestering us, putting things on the bbq and cooking it for us even though it was mentioned we wanted to do it ourself and kept on coming back on top of that, she served us the food on our bbq without asking if we wanted it or if it's to the desired \"doneness\" we liked.
- Appetizers were just okay
- Limited options for things to bbq
- Very expensive for the quantity of food $20 per option
- Quality of the food is mediocre
- Sauces for dipping the bbq was mediocre
- They also took the check/tipping receipt while we were still at the table!?

I never plan to come back here, I love korean bbq, but this place was horrid."}
{"text":"The authentic-but-mediocre food might have earned three stars on its own, but the appalling customer service makes this the worst restaurant experience I have had during my six years living in Madison.

We arrived around 8pm on a Friday to a nearly full restaurant--of the 12ish tables in the restaurant, two of them were empty but hadn't yet been bussed. We waited about ten minutes near the cash register by the door before asking someone behind the counter if there would be a wait--about ten minutes, she said--and proceeding to grab our own menus from a stack piled up on a nearby chair. We perused the menus for another twenty minutes before asking to be seated for a second time, at which point another group had arrived behind us and the woman who helped us before actually began bussing the tables.

Unfortunately, she got distracted midway through, so it was another ten minutes before we were seated and half an hour more before she returned to take our order. At this point, it was past 9pm. She took our order, promised the food would come out quickly, and disappeared for another twenty minutes. The next time she checked on our table, it was to tell us that they were out of the bibimbap, which all three people in our party had ordered. She took our new orders and returned again about ten minutes later to tell us they were also out of the dumplings, which we had ordered more than half an hour before.

When we finally got our food, it was nearing 10pm. That's more than an hour and a half to be seated, order, and be served. It might have been authentic Korean, but it was greasy and my bul go ki beef was nowhere near worth the wait."}
{"text":"Unfortunately very disappointed. Food was undercooked (red meat inside) and flavor wasn't there."}
{"text":"Lunch here is super cheap and amazingly filling! 

I went in the other day to get the bulgogi lunch box (under $10), and I was absolutely impressed by the ample variety of sides and large portions of bulgogi and rice that I got served in a bento-like dish. The sides included a cabbage salad topped with a tangy dressing, mandoo (fried dumpling), kimchi, and delicately sweet cucumber pickles (I could eat these all day). In the main dish sections of the box were a generous helping of well-marinaded bulgogi and a big scoop of rice (albeit slightly dry).

The bulgogi was perfectly salted and delightfully sweet. Bonus - the beef had no annoying gristle! I honestly expected to chew and grind through it seeing as how it was under $10, but every bite was tender. 

My lunchmate, on the other hand, had the spicy pork lunch box, and, oh my god, I hope you can tell I loved the bulgogi, but get this: next time, I'll order the spicy pork. It was that good. It wasn't too spicy (so if you love spicy, ask them if they can make it hotter), but, like the bulgogi, the pork was perfectly salted and tender. The difference is that the sauce had that red pepper flavor that I so adore.

For the appetizer which showed up a little bit after the boxes, we got the kimchi pancake. I. Love. This. Pancake. If you're not familiar with kimchi pancakes, it's not a risen hot cake you get at a diner. The batter is usually a liquidy combination of water, chopped kimchi and extra kimchi juice, flour, and corn starch which is then panfried to achieve a lightly crisp outer layer and soft inner layer. Guys, their kimchi pancake reminded me of my Korean friends' cooking but EVEN BETTER. If you thought I loved the spicy pork lunch box, well, I could marry their kimchi pancake.

I definitely will be back here again. And if you're there and hear someone whispering sweet nothings to her kimchi pancake, well, that's probably me."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 5 stars for the food. FINALLLY, some decent Korean food in Madison. Yes, do give yourself a LOT of time when going to eat here. This is NOT one of those quick lunch places. We were lucky and went during a random weekday and we only stayed 1 hour in the restaurant. 

Be prepared to wait and make sure you have good company with you. You know you're at a legit Asian place when the food is great, the wait is long, and the service sucks. 

We ordered the Ddukboki which was spicy and good. The pork bulgogi lunch box was bigger than we had expected. They replenished our side dishes and our waitress kept us updated on my soup. I order Soondoo boo (soft tofu soup) which was excellent!! Prices are decent. Don't waste your time at those fusion places, this place is legit Korean."}
{"text":"the best Korean food restaurant in Madison, the third best Asian restaurant in Madison"}
{"text":"Newest Korean restaurant in town. Very friendly stuff except men, cook ? I don't know and I don't care. Women servers are great, they talk to you so friendly even they keep talk to you almost non-stop, don't give you time to bite your food. I believe this place's TASTES are closest to Chicago Korean town level. But could be better."}
{"text":"Hold on, I'm still noming on my delicious Dukbokki and kimchi pancake right now to type a full review but this is my second time here and everything I've gotten is oh so good and authentic. 

They do not skimp on the finely ground dried chili pepper here (gochugaru )! 

There are no pre portioned or premixed ingredients here, you can see the hardworking ajumma cooking your dish in their open kitchen right where you walk in.

K brb"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is so-so. The lunch bento box is really worth it."}
{"text":"Don't let the one-star yelp reviews dissuade you or you'll regretfully miss out on this gem. I've been to several Korean and Korean-fusion restaurants around Madison and this place is the most authentic in my opinion. 

In terms of the decor, it's not the greatest, but hey, I'm there for the food! We ordered the kimchi jjigae, pork bulgogi, and beef bulgogi (banchan is served as well). The food came out pippin' hot. Both bulgogi dishes were packed with flavor! Though I do think the kimchi jjigae could have used a bit more tweaking of flavor. Overall, still not disappointed. The service is quite good and our waitress was so incredibly nice. She reminded me of my mom!

A reviewer further down wished that this was an LA joint...which makes no sense because we're in MADISON. And as someone who has been had Korean food in both Los Angeles and Chicago...this place is still a home run."}
{"text":"Really good food, legit Korean flavours and the two ladies working there are super kind. Portions are big and prices are very reasonable for the quality. They were making us try other food too and they didn't charge for it. We loved it and we want to back again."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous; WAYYY gooder than Sol's on the Square. 

The dukbokgi was spot on, spicy and not too soupy. Loved the shredded cabbage and fish cakes, could've lived without the shredded carrots but I just pushed them aside. 

The Banchan (side dishes) were all light and tasty. 

The Kalbi was marinated with some type of fruit (the best kalbi's usually are) and I inquired. She said it's marinated in , , ,  and something else I forgot. Five fruits total and the meat was perfectly tenderized. I did miss the onions that Sol's had on the skillet but without was just fine. 

Kimchee jjigae (kimchee soup) was good. Not spicy enough and not enough flavor, but still good. My dining buddy is sick so I was focusing on soups but the duk guk came to the rescue. 

Duk guk (rice cakes in ovals, rather than the tubes like dukbokgi...otherwise same. It's just mashed rice) was SOLID! Best soup in a long time, beef broth was flavorful, rice cakes were cooked well, eggs were light and fluffy, and the seaweed garnish added a nice saltiness to the soup. 

Bibim naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles) were ok. Served with a side of mul naengmyeon (cold noodles in a cold, sour soup? soup was a nice addition, as the noodles were too dry to eat without some soup in it. I added more gochujang but I always do. My dining buddy did NOT like the mul naengmyeon soup, and didn't care much for this dish overall. More for me! 

Actually ate here twice in one day; solid Korean choice! We'll be back next time we're in town for more Badger-mania!"}
{"text":"I think this is a 3 star restaurant, but I am going to give it a 4 because I personally think it is the only place in Madison to get decent Korean food - not Korean fusion or modernized Korean food. Just legitimately, typical food you would get from a Korean restaurant.

I get jjajjangmyun cravings, and before I moved here, I could go to 10 different restaurants  within 20 minutes away and fulfill those cravings, but not anymore! So trust me when I say, i take my jjajjangmyun seriously! This is the only place that i can find that has decent jjajjangmyun. It is so easy to mess this dish up, so I was really happy when I enjoyed the dish. Good portions, variety of vegetables, and they dont skimp out on the meat in this dish (lots of places do!)

What sets apart Korean dining experience from other Asian experiences, is the banchan. Their banchan (side dishes) were medium. I had better and I've had worse. Decent variety, but banchan is eaten with rice, and here, You have to pay for the first bowl. Ive never eaten at a korean restaurant where they charge the first bowl of rice.

I haven't had their bbq yet. But judging from rhe prices, seems like the usual korean bbq price. 

Their service has gotten a lot better since the last time I ate here, but let's be honest, who goes to an Asian restaurant expecting good service? If I don't leave feeling verbally abused, did I even experience authetic Asian food? 

In conclusion, I like this place. whenever I miss my mom's cooking and am lazy to cook Korean food for myself, I know this place will hit the spot."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. 

The first time I came was not such a great experience. I was really excited to try this new Korean place so I only had a light lunch so I could eat a lot for dinner. That was a mistake! It was packed! But we did get seated right away but waited 20 minutes to have someone to bring us water and take our order. I knew they just opened and it was packed so we tried to be patient. But an hour passed. So we were already there for 1 hour and a half with only the half filled glass of water we got from a gentleman that didn't seem like he really wanted to serve us. After waiting a little longer we decided to leave and eat somewhere else before we became a bag of bones. I didn't right a review at the moment since I wanted to give this place another chance.

The second time here... we came at the right time. Only another table was there. We ordered three dishes and a kimchi pancake. There were two ladies that served us. Only one was pleasant. Which is why I gave this place a better score. The other lady brought out a seafood pancake instead of the kimchi one I ordered. I told her ordered a kimchi one but she said it was a mistake on their part and just made us take it. I thought it would at least get taken out of the bill since the one I ordered never got delivered. But nope be paid for a pancake we didn't order and never got the one we ordered. But the food was good, good portions.

They just need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! They really do have THE BEST TASTING dukboki in town!

The stone bowl and tofu soup is also really good! 

Definitely recommend for anyone who wants authentic Korean food!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, lots of food, like a bowl feeds a family. The people that work there cracked us up. Only problem, I can't go back for at least a week. That is how long it's going to take to eat the leftovers for lunch and supper."}
{"text":"The first time we tried this place, we were blown away.  Kind of pricey, but the BBQ was really tasty.  My wife and I didn't mind paying $15 a head for the meal we got.

The third time we visited, the place was a disaster.  The waitresses were curt and even a little unpleasant.  We had to pretty much ask for each piece of silverware that was missing from the table.  As icing on the cake, their stereo was broken and we listened to the same 45 seconds of \"I'm Yours\" by Jason Mraz on loop.  But we were there for food - not atmosphere.

They brought out the BBQ suspiciously fast.  Expecting the piping hot, aromatic masterpiece from our first two visits, you can imagine how dissapointed we were to witness a few unseasoned strips of half frozen beef swimming in what looked like tepid bathwater.  At that point, we couldn't help but laugh at how surreal things had gotten - paying $30 for what looked like a Hungry Man frozen dinner from a server that we had seen twice in sixty minutes.  I tried to be chill, but it was so hot that I melted and fell right through the cracks... oh yeah did I mention that nobody fixed the music?

We returned a fourth time.  Maybe they just had an off night.  It's a new restaurant, and I could  forgive them if they simply got blindsided by the first nice day of spring and the sudden surge of hungry customers.  We ordered takeout, and when I got home and witnessed the same $30 tepid bathwater beef from our last visit, I couldn't help but laugh.  My wife called and explained that her beef was still cold in the middle and clearly not done cooking.  The woman on the phone said she would need to see the meat before she could issue a refund.  We were amazed.  What kind of place requires physical evidence before issuing a refund?

So I guess you, dear reader, need to make the judgement call.  Are we just a couple of beef snobs?  Are we a pair of scammers that tried to get a free meal?  Maybe we travel the country with our own half frozen Korean bathwater BBQ decoy meal and, now that Madison is sacked, we're on our way to Chicago tonight to run the same hustle.  Or maybe this restaurant is giving up on making people happy."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: as good as it was, one of the main reasons I'm giving this place a 5 is because it is one of the only places to get good Korean food in Madison. Being Korean, this is something I dearly miss. But be aware that this is not exactly \"Korean BBQ\" in the cook-the-meat-on-a-grill-in-front-of-you sort of way. They have a standard Korean menu with some Korean meats, along with sushi and other Japanese selections.

Food (4.5/5): We shared the galbi (beef ribs), which were my favorite, dolsot bibimbap, kimchi jeon (kimchi pancakes), and a spicy salmon roll. The galbi was seasoned with a yummy sweet and salty marinade and came out sizzling hot. It compared well with the galbi my mom makes, as well as galbi I've had in Korea. It definitely makes me wanna try the other, cheaper meats on their grill section. The dolsot bibimbap was pretty fantastic; I would definitely order it again. And the kimchi jeon was HUGE and the texture and flavor was on point. The spicy salmon roll was good, but I'm also not a huge sushi connoisseur so it wasn't my favorite. The banchan (extra side dishes) hit it out of the park for me. The cabbage kimchi was extremely delicious, as was the radish kimchi (my personal favorite)! They also gave us this sweet, soy sauce based potato banchan that was very delicious. Serving sizes were generous. We all had food babies afterwards, and we didn't even get to finish the jeon.

Atmosphere (3.5/5): Nothing special. Feels like they are still getting prepared.

Service (3.5/5): They are definitely still getting experience running the restaurant, as the service was sometimes slow, but we didn't mind as we conversed and waited for the food (or ate the food after it was out). We never ran low on water though, so nothing to complain about, just don't be in a rush to leave. They were all very friendly.

Overall: Best Korean food I've had in Madison so far. I still need to check out some other places, but so far I have not been impressed by other offerings. Only complaint is it is a bit pricey, but I guess that is expected for Korean food in Madison. It is still worth it since you'd have to drive to Chicago (or cook it yourself) to get good Korean food otherwise. I will definitely be checking out more of their dishes soon, and updating this review. Check it out and give them some business so that good Korean food will stay in Madison!"}
{"text":"*sigh* this place.....where to begin?

I went here a few nights ago with some friends and had a disaster of an experience.  The first hint was when i was walking in (a little after 7PM), I noticed the sign said 'closed'. I knew my friends were in there waiting for me, so I walked in and found their table. Once I sat down, my friends promptly told me how the waiter was turning everyone who walked in down and saying something about 'not having enough food'. There were only about 3 other tables with people and the every other table was empty. 

We waited for about 15 minutes before the 'server' came over to take our order. He struggled really hard to take our orders. He didn't know the menu, he asked us to repeat our orders several times, and subsequently wrote our order on 4-5 Post-it notes and stuck them to the wall. At the same time I ordered something I couldn't pronounce so I used the numbering system they provide on the menu. He promptly told me that he didn't know the menu so I attempted to say the name at which point he told me that he 'wasn't Korean'. Okay? Not sure why that matters to be honest because you are the server at the restaurant and should be familiar with the dishes offered and their names. But whatever, moving on.

As we waited for our meal, we continued to watch the server turn down customers. Our food came out, was haphazardly placed on the table. One of my friends orders was completely wrong. In addition the server forgot to bring rice out for the dishes and the 'sides' you ask? Oh he just placed them on another table and forgot about them. So we had to go get the side dishes ourselves. The rice came out about 15 minutes later. 

Most my friends did not enjoy their meals. I got some kimchi and pork dish which I thought was tasty, but I tried some other dishes and they were pretty 'meh'. Too sweet, not warm enough, etc etc.

Anyways we finish our meal and are closing out this restaurant at 8PM. We asked to split the check (we had asked in the beginning and thought that's what the Post-It notes were for) and he told us that it was 'too hard' to do it at the table and to come up to the cash register and tell him what we ordered. This experience took 10 freaking minutes. Several people repeated their orders and he just couldn't figure out how to ring them up. It was a mess. In the end, my husband and I ended up paying a suspiciously high bill and just gave up. 

So overall, avoid this place or order take-out if you can. Regardless, it's overpriced and poorly run. The food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I read the reviews but the food looked good and we decided to try it. 

It was a Friday and they are open to 10. We got there by 8:30 so we figured we had plenty of time.  

Greeting was nice but took a while to take a drink order. 

We asked for the table barbecue but were told they were out of meat. Really?  On a Friday night?  And then they had meat if you got a dish made in the kitchen. In hindsight it seems like they thought we would take too long. 

So we were finishing our sake at 9:38 and watching a close curling match between Japan and Korea. Suddenly the waiter came over and told us and another table they were closing and we would have to leave. 

No warning. Just get out. 

Then they promptly turned off the TV,  at the end of the overtime round, and started turning off the lights.  

If it were closer to 10 I could better understand.  But two tables left and a close match on TV and no heads up they wanted to close early.

Food was very good, as was the service, but the manners of the managers were awful."}
{"text":"Food was great. Did the cooking at the table option and as long as you properly cook the meat, very delicious."}
{"text":"Ok. So I've been waiting here an hour and realize it's thanksgiving eve and all the staff are out of town. But put a fucking CLOSED sign on the door then. This is Korean right? Can I get a pickle plate!! Seriously burnt peanut butter noodles? Dry kimchee pancake? I should have just jumped into traffic at the busy corner instead. Oh, the soup was good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try 5 Star Korean BBQ for quite awhile. It's on a busy intersection we drive by all the time. Last Thursday night we finally stopped while walking back from Breese Stevens Field. It does have a little parking lot, but its location might make it a challenge to get in and out of by car.

It was incredibly hot that day so I was looking forward to eating inside a cool air-conditioned restaurant. It wasn't that cool inside 5 Star. Our table was by the window and I was sweltering. When I went to use the restroom on the other side of the restaurant where the grill tables are, it was cool over there. They need to work on the circulation for these hot days. I was uncomfortable throughout the entire meal.

The atmosphere is a little bit divey/dingy but everything seems clean. Our waitress brought us menus and a couple of small waters which I knew she'd need to refill many times. She was very friendly and made recommendations when asked. We ordered the Bul Go Ki Beef and the Oh Sam Bul Go Ki. We were served five sides for our banchan. Thin slices of marinated fish cake, seaweed salad, kimchi, steamed eggplant, and broccoli with some radish. My partner loved the eggplant. He also loved the beef and says this is his new favorite Korean restaurant and he can't wait to go back. Mine was the pork and squid in spicy sauce. The pork was delicious and juicy. The squid however was terribly overcooked. It was like trying to chew through rubber. The flavor of the sauce was great, but the texture of the squid was nearly inedible. Portion sizes were good and we took leftovers home.

My partner loved it so I'm sure we will go back. I will not order the squid."}
{"text":"Korean food experience starts with superb service. Here at 5 star, I give them less than 1 Star if I could. We were seated right away but after that nothing went right. It took them ages to take our order. They were busy and unorganized. I went with a party of six. They were taking orders for people who came much after us but we were left with a glass of water they start with. 

After taking our orders, it felt like ages till our food arrived. I actually had to mention to the lady that we had to wait for so long. Our waiter who claimed to be New didn't know what he was serving also. When our food came out, he just left it at the end of the table. When we asked him what it was, he says I don't know, I am New. We had to figure things ourselves. The lady who seem really busy herself later came to tell us what each one was. Once which was noted mild on the menu and we ordered mild were extremely spicy and once we ordered spicy were mild. When we mentioned that to the lady, she says this soup is never mild. -- I don't know why the heck they have that as an option on their menu. It's J-2 on their menu. 
We ordered 2 appetizer, 4 different soup dishes and one bulgogi. One of our appetizer didn't come till we actually had to ask what happened to the rice cake order??? Well... our waitress didn't even put the order in the kitchen. So after we had all almost finished eating- our appetizer came out. The lady was working really hard but I can't see her being able to handle all the customers by herself. 

The food wasn't at all impressive either. I have had much better Korean here in Madison. I think New Seoul is way better. 

If u plan to try this place, have a lot of patience. For me- it's my last time here for sure."}
{"text":"Everything won't be available on the menu and the service will be delightfully disorganized but the food will make you feel like your at your Korean Aunties house you didn't know you had. Sooo good, sooo authentic and they have pitchers of beer."}
{"text":"Wow... not being from madison and have been traveling the US for the past 2 months I have tried many korean restaurants.. Me being a native newyorker this hands down beats all of the korean restaurants i have been to so far!! what can i say this spot is amazing.. talk about home cooking.. speechless.. im honestly suprised this place isnt packed with people.. the food and sevice was delicious!! The dduk man doo guk was as good if not better then my moms cooking.. (dont tell her) lols the kalbi and bulgogi was definitely as traditional as it can get .. wow i am beyond speechless.. if you want to have a try or enjoy yourself some traditional korean food this is the place!! This place definitely is under the radar which is great but i need to spread the love. I brought a few friends with me to eat here and they are beyond satisfied.. the side dishes were how they were suppose to be free of charge which is what made me happy lols. Belly is full and happy thank you 5star korean bbq for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried this place because the Yep reviews were positive. 

We order 1 app and 2 dishes. I have to say we both agreed the food was too salty for our taste. However, the  service was fast, which was nice."}
{"text":"It pains me to do this, but I've got to lower my rating based off my second visit here. On my first visit, the service was impeccable and the food was great.

I came here again recently, and we had a new second waitress I hadn't seen the first time around. I have it on good faith that she has a good personal reason for her attitude, but she was very rude to us, and good faith alone cannot justify tainting the sanctity of my Yelp honesty - I mean come on, we Yelp reviewers are using our hard-earned procrastination time to write these reviews in the hopes that the ratings have more depth and accuracy to them than Facebook or Google reviews, right? Right??

Anyway, the food was great again - albeit a bit on the pricey side - and while the seasoning of our dishes was perfectly balanced, we were given a bit of an extra sour taste from one of the servers, and left with a bit more saltiness than expected.

*On the bright side, the establishment has upgraded their seating accommodations since my first time here as well as getting brand new menus and opening Korean BBQ tables now. Here's to hoping some of these service issues are resolved as well! I'm rooting for this place!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but service was poor. The waitress misheard us and came out with the wrong order, but insisted that we were the ones that made the mistake. She refused to get our orders right and in the end we had to pay for something we didn't want. We had to repeatedly ask for water refills, everything was slow. Granted, there was only one (or maybe two) waitress for the whole restaurant, but if you're so understaffed please at least be courteous to customers."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 for dinner. We sat for 2.5 hours, half of us got our dish and and half of us didn't. I was the half that didn't. They could seriously use some waitressing experience. If you go, make sure you order at the register because they don't come to the table. For me, its gonna be a first and last visit. Prices are overly expensive for the poor service."}
{"text":"Boo Dae Ji Gae was not even filled up with soup...I'm not asking you to put more meat or noodles in it but as least give me enough soup that I can drink! N for the first time that I know you don't put ramen noodles in a boo Dae Ji Gae but Udon?! N no rice cake in it?! WTF boo Dae Ji Gae aka Army base stew, it is a Korean style stew with American ingredients! So what's that Udon coming from? 
We also got a Dol Sot bul go Ki Bibimbob. It taste ok. Nothing special but I was surprised to see a bowl of miso soup came with the bibimbob... n again... half filled up... i mean I'm ok with not having any miso soup but if the restaurant decided to offer, then you should offer at least a decent size instead of half filled everything."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Wisconsin  hands down.  It was almost as good as when I was actually in country.  I loved the fact that they had duk boki.  Look forward to coming here whenever I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! After we were seated, they told us to stand up and move the table because a larger group of people came in. We stood there awkwardly for several minutes. It was extremely rude. Then when we asked questions about the menu, the waitress answered very impatiently. It also took them forever to bring out our food. Also took forever for them to take my check! Finally i had to hand them my card. She printed the receipt and was like: \"I need you to sign!\" I signed and gave her no tip and I don't feel sorry for it!"}
{"text":"Please read this review if you're vegetarian:

Given all the five star reviews that this restaurant has received, my boyfriend and I showed up with high hopes. However, the experience that we had here was akin to going home for the holidays...but in all the worst ways. 

We arrived around 6:30 pm and were warmly greeted and seated. It seemed like they were understaffed for the day, so we didn't mind the service itself. The one waitress in the restaurant truly was doing the best that she could to manage 7 tables, which varied from pairs to groups of 5. Of all the tables there, only two had their food, so we knew we were in for a wait. About fifteen minutes in, our waitress was able to free herself to take our order and drop by with water. I ordered a vegetarian dolsot bibimbap, and my boyfriend ordered the kimchi pancake and seafood soondubu jjigae. 

Here's where it starts going downhill.

Another 30 minutes passed by before our waitress came by with side dishes, at which point, we saw another table get up and leave because they had been waiting to place their order for some 15 minutes to no avail. Tensions were clearly rising in the kitchen, as we heard yelling between our waitress and one (of two) cooks. At one point, the cook walked out of the kitchen, angrily glared at the other patrons waiting anxiously for their food, and went back to yelling at our waitress. Believe me when I say it was like being back home all over again and witnessing a divorce in the making.

Around 7:20, our waitress brought out my dish (the vegetarian one), and I noticed that it had beef in it. I told her about the mix up, she hurriedly took the dish back, and more yelling ensued in the kitchen... When she brought it back out, it was clear that she had just removed the meat and artfully replaced the old ingredients on top. When I moved the vegetables to the side, the rice was still brown from the meat sauce, and specks of beef were still present. I really didn't want to complain, but I'd gotten sick from eating beef before (after some 25 years of vegetarianism...), so my boyfriend approached her and asked if they could replace the dish with one that didn't have beef mixed in already. Cue more kitchen yelling. 

After about 5 minutes, the cook personally approached our table and told me, quite bluntly and very loudly, \"Miss, I won't serve you. Everything that I cook has beef broth in it. You say you'll get sick, so, yeah, *I'm not going to serve you.*\" She then turned and walked away while I sat gaping behind her. The thing is... I completely understand that they were backed up on orders and were rushed for time, but the tone of voice and body language that she used genuinely made me feel like I was being chastised for /being a paying customer/ at their restaurant. Despite the fact that the initial mix-up was on their end and not mine, there was no apology; and when it was pointed out that they had simply recycled the dish right back to me, she got angry with *me*. What.

Both the cook and waitress stood in the kitchen, arms crossed, as I glanced back and forth between them and my boyfriend, wondering what weird world I had stepped into. First off, didn't the menu have vegetarian icons next to /several/ dishes? Second, how was a miscommunication between the waitress and the cook (i.e., the wrong order) suddenly the reason why I was being yelled at in front of an entire restaurant? Honestly, I was beyond mortified at that point, and now that I look back on it, I'm wondering why I wasn't, instead, indignant over the way she'd spoken to me! If I wanted to be talked to that way, I'd go home to eat!

After a few more moments of awkward staring, the cook called out from the kitchen that, -maybe-, there were other dishes I could order. I'd mentioned that I was vegetarian, so she offered several seafood dishes... Given the potential language barrier, okay, sure, I guess I could understand how \"vegetarian\" might translate to \"no land meat\"... However, I'm not so sure if, when a dish is incorrectly made (and the difference takes it from being vegetarian to NOT-vegetarian), it's acceptable to simply remove the beef, mix up the veggies, and call it fixed... 

So she brought over the menu to me and then pointed to three dishes I could have as a vegetarian--all of which were seafood-based. At this point, I asked her why I couldn't have the dishes that had VEGETARIAN marked beside it (and believe me, there were PLENTY of those). Again, she said that she used beef broth to cook all the veggies. I'm just so flabbergasted by this. Why mark dishes as vegetarian if they're cooked with beef broth?!

So... My boyfriend, being such a great sport, asked if they'd cooked his dishes yet. It was 7:45 at this point (an hour and 15 minutes since we stepped in). They hadn't. *We* apologized for wasting *their* time and left.

Long story short: The menu says vegetarian. It's not vegetarian. Also, it's cheaper to get yelled at, at home."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife and her parents for lunch. Food came out hot and you can tell it was nice and fresh. Food overall lacked seasoning and was bland. Had good spice to it but the hot sauce they use is so over powering it killed flavor out of the food. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly authentic Korean in Madison!
My boyfriend and I were craving Korean on the way back from the Dells and decided to swing by on a Sunday evening for some Korean grub. The place had a good mix of patrons so we felt good about our decision. Given the cold weather, we decided that warming ourselves up with some jjigae/soup would be an excellent decision.

We ordered:
- Beef Soondubu: I'm kind of used to small mom and pop Korean shops to use the standard stock you find at Korean super markets. However, this place's broth was surprisingly flavorful and rich. I loved the generous portion of tofu and vegetables - however the beef in the soondubu was a bit lacking. What was present was pretty tough. Nevertheless, I gobbled up the entire bowl of jjigae and ended up warm and happy.
- Gamja Tang: Pretty authentic gamja tang. We went with the spicy soup and there was a heft amount of pork and potatoes. My boyfriend was a a little bit annoyed at how little meat was on the bone of the pork and left a little bit hungry after our meal.

I know that sometimes Korean shops are a bit rougher around the edges in terms of service, but the ajummas that served us were very nice and made sure we always had enough napkins, banchan, and water. 

Overall, I'm definitely a fan of the soondubu - and the portions for the bulgogi/kalbi from our neighboring tables seemed quite hefty. Some minor edits to the food would earn this place a 5 from me!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Five Star Korean BBQ was a firm FIVE! My dining bud and I feasted on Hae Mul Pa (TOTAL SCORE!!), Bi Bim Bob (the fried egg on top is da bomb diggety!!), and Bul Go Ki Beef (yuuuuuuum!)! I've not before experience Korean cuisine, so this was a fab first time endeavor!! These dishes were so flavorful and darn right GOOD! I, also, had a Milkis beverage...which to me, was like carbonated, melted Dreamsicle!! OOOOOOH YEAH!!!! My pal had a Crunch Crunch Pear and thought it was equally fantastic, with a genuine pear flavor. We had gone on a Tuesday evening and service was stellar! The female server (I'm thinking she was the owner) was so helpful to my novice self in explaining so many of the dishes and being delightfully available and fun. However...visit number two was a bit different. This was a Friday after work and it was VERY BUSY, both with walk-in traffic and online orders. Service was poor at best because of this, including bad attitude. My dining bud and I brought along another friend and we were VERY hurriedly rushed to order. This, being our friends first time in a Korean eatery with no idea as to where to begin, was not a good start. I ordered a Katsu Chicken and a Katsu Pork (to go), Dining Bud ordered the Bi Bim Bob, and Another Friend ordered Duk Bae Gi Haemul Tang. Both Katsu dishes were subpar...flavorless, flatted-flat meat between deep fried breading. The Katsu sause was equally without zest of flavor and the salad was an iceberg variety (ehh). Dining Bud LOVED her Bi Bim Bob and was very satisfied. Another Friend liked the seafood in her Duk Bae Gi Haemul Tang, but found the broth and vegetables bland and flavorless and ended up leaving it. DANG! This was such a disappointment for me and Another Friend. Dining Bud was pretty happy though. But this visit dropped my rating to a one star and I decided to split the difference with a three. On a positive note: the place was hoppin' with patrons and the online business was going crazy (the phones and iPad were ringing off the wall). I'll give it one more shot with my son, who is at the ready to give it a whirl as a first-timer."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I will definitely come back. The restaurant has its own big parking lot and right by the corner so it is very convenient. The staffs are overly friendly and sometimes she insisted on what I should order, which I found a little bit annoying because I wanted to have a little bit privacy and control over what I am going to eat lol. But the food was quality which convinced me to give this a 3 star. It was very homey and priced decently. I love the chicken soup with sesame leaf. The broth was very flavorful. All other soups looked amazing on the menu too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first date here. He loves it and was super excited to find a Korean spot that serves the real deal (he lived in Korea for 3 years and misses the food terribly).

The staff are great, though some of them don't speak English fluently, so if that's a problem and you're gonna get huffy about it, stop looking for authentic food from other cultures and go back to Culver's.

The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but I think the food makes up for it. We always get the grill-your-own dinner (please don't ask me to say/spell it - I'm not there yet). The steak and pork belly are my favs.

I'm anxious to come back and try the japchae (which is MY all-time favorite Korean, and now that Yelpers have spoken, will have to be my next meal here).

Bathrooms are clean and there's a little private parking lot on the side (getting in and out can be a bit dicey if you're unfamiliar with the area, but it's worth it, I think).

Let me know what you think - I'm always down to discuss Ko-foo!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has now opened!! We ate here for dinner and are pleased that it's an authentic Korean restaurant with fresh ingredients and seasonings.  Our group had the Kalbi ribs, seafood tofu soup and  a pork tofu soup and everyone liked what they had ordered.  I appreciated that the tofu soup was not overly salty and had that authentic spiciness that built up as I was eating it.  Dinner included Banchan (side dishes) which included a few radish sides, broccoli, bean sprouts, and kimchi which was particularly good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, i found the food to be mostly great but with terribly slow, unresponsive, but not mean service. I recently went back because I was really craving jajiang men black bean noodles. This time, the food hit the spot, and the service was was wicked fast, so I'm bumping them up to 4.

By now, I've tried a lot of their menu items. I really like their bbq dishes; they all perfectly balance the flavor theyre going for. My favorite is the sam gyap sal kimchi bokeum (pork and kimchi). It's not too sweet or spicy, and the chewy pork blends well with the carmelized kimchi and crunchy cabbage. The individual ingredients are very detectable, but they still seem to become one flavor. The bibimbap is satisfying and full of fun ingredients to mix into your rice. The jajiang men has wonderfully chewy noodles, smooth and savory blacl bean flavor, and surprisingly julienned cucumber that really takes the dish to the next level when it comes to fragrance.

The only thing I don't like is the haemul pajeon seafood pancake. This is usually one of my favorite foods, but theirs could be crispier and less mushy.

Also, free wifi!"}
{"text":"If you think this place is good, you haven't had real good kbbq(Korean barbeque). Server was a little too efficient. I'm more use to just cooking the meat myself. Didn't like how the server brought out the check so fast and after signing the receipt, she grabbed it right away. Very low portion for what we've paid for, for the two plates (beef and pork). 

Note: Came by on a Tuesday evening around 5 pm. I it's 5:40 when we left. Felt like I just left a fast food joint. Definitely DON'T recommend this place & NOT coming back."}
{"text":"Tip #1 for everyone who plans on eating here: Be patient. If you're starving and need food now then maybe this isn't the place for you.

This place is a real ma and pa shop and their staff is very very small. We saw 2 cooks and 2 waitresses. Came here on a Friday night so it was busy. I did notice that there was a couple who yelled at the waitress and left because they had to wait too long for their dishes so I was concerned at first. Once we were seated we received water right away but it did take some time for the waitress to come back to take our order but hey, it was a busy night and they did their best to get to every table. When you're sitting in the restaurant you literally see everything. You see the waitresses running back and forth to get everything done, you see the kitchen and how hard to cooks are working to get everyone's order out. Be patient. They're doing what they can to get to their customers.

Once we ordered it took about 20 minutes to get our food out and it all didn't come out at once, which we didn't mind. The food is absolutely outstanding and everything is made absolutely fresh and hot. I don't want to bash other Korean restaurants (since they're all not bad) but this was by far my favorite and definitely worth the wait. The waitresses didn't necessarily check on us or asked how things were tasting but they made sure our drinks and side dishes were always full.

I know there are a good chunk of negative reviews based on the service but once I was there I understood why service was slow. Its fresh, it's real, and it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is a family run Korean restaurant and it is usually pretty slow. The service is a little strange, however very friendly. The decor is pretty boring and you can tell that these ladies simply needed a place to cook and share their food. 

Which is there best thing about this place - the food! It is simply amazing. Great, authentic Korean BBQ. You don't cook it at your table, but that is ok. Fantastic prices and the staff will answer any questions you have. 

I got the spicy seafood soup and was simply blown away. It came to the table still boiling, filling my nose with its scent. It tasted like heaven, everything perfectly cooked and the flavors working together perfectly. It had so many different things and flavors in there. 

My friends and husband all got different items and were very impressed. Our table was just filled with so much amazing food. They came out and refilled our water very often, and when we went to order 3 fried ice creams for dessert the staff was nice enough to tell us \"two is enough!\" And she was right, two was plenty. 

Overall, this is the best restaurant I have been to in Madison. Strange vibe and service, however just amazing food. One bad thing is that you have to pay at the counter, which my party didn't know, so we sat waiting for our bill for about 15 minutes until we figured it out. 

However, even after that, I tipped them $25 on a $35 bill because it was just that good. They could easily charge double what they are."}
{"text":"Can't really speak about the food because we waited 1.5 hours and NEVER saw a morsel of anything. And, there were people there before us and they didn't have food either. Not a good sign. Great place if you bring your own food. Don't go if you're hungry cause you'll die."}
{"text":"The attitude of server is really poor!!!
We've been waited for like 1 hour to get our food. We ordered kimchi with pork belly meat is cold without meat. 
The older server is yelled at us. 
Loyal advice, never visit this restaurant if you don't want to waste your time and get yelled at."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. A solid place to go, especially with a big group. Unfortunately, there was no space for KBBQ when we got there so we sat at the regular dining area. We tried several different dishes (from all parts of the menu), including chap chae, seafood pancake, bulgolgi, some soups, some sizzling dishes, stir fried rice cake, etc. Everything came out quickly and was decently tasty. Portions were decently sized and we appreciated the little dishes that we had on the side. I wasn't a fan of the Myul Nang Mun cold soup (buckwheat noodles) but that's a personal preference. 

It's a little pricey, but I have to keep reminding myself this isn't California, where AYCE KBBQ exists. Overall, Madison has sparse pickings for Korean BBQ so I definitely wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered jjajangmyun to go and was very disappointed. The noodles were too soft and sauce tasted like instant jjajangmyun ramen from the Asian store. Why spend $14 here when you can get the same flavor for $2? They also didn't have any garlic, peppers, or lettuce when we went for kbbq."}
{"text":"Warning: THIS IS KOREAN FOOD, not American BBQ. I can't tell you how many times, while eating with friends, I've seen people come in thinking it's American BBQ because they see 5 Star BBQ. So if you're checking the out via Yelp first...good for you. Now you know. 

This place is honestly a great place when comparing it to other Korean options in Madison. There are practically only 2-3 other options that are  1) overpriced, 2) too \"fusion\"' for me, and 3) limited menus.

Service
This is something they will probably work on. It's honestly a family business where one sister is in the kitchen with a prep cook and the other sister is the server, hostess and all of the above. You have to be super patient and understanding considering their situation. I've thought about applying for a job there to help them out. Be kind y'all. 

Food
If you like spicy, they can make it habanero spicy so be cautious. I recommend everything. Gamja Tang (pork bone potato soup) had a nice kick to it and the potatoes were huge! The Samgyupsal Kimchi Bokeum was good. I'd recommend you ordering it with the tofu for $2 extra. Friends have ordered the Al Tang (fish soup) and it's soooo good. You have to get the Seafood Pancake as the appetizer. This is probably the best Seafood Pancake I've had in the Midwest. It almost takes like my Grandma's! 

Location
Pretty nice that they are located on the corner of Blair and East Wash. Lots of parking available. I'd recommend you carpool with friends if you can Justin case they get busy during the dinner time. It definitely got busy when I was there two different times with friends. 

Alcohol is available. Water is refilled often. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the quality of the food nor how it compares to other Korean restaurants.  My companion and I arrive at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon looking only for a quick bite.  We ordered a single plate of appetizers.  After waiting half an hour, we realized that the people who had been there when we came in also hadn't been served.  Parties that came in were not waited on, and the kitchen staff didn't seem particularly energized.  To be fair, there was only one person working the floor, but why would you seat people and have them wait fifteen minutes without waiting on them?  Lots of tables looking around and putting their heads in their hands.  We got our food after 50 minutes and maybe ate it in ten.  It was also not exactly what we had ordered (half and half of a mandu).  Do I feel sorry for the staff? Not really.  Unprofessional in a very competitive dining market likely spells the end.  Would I eat here again?  You're kidding, right?  At least two other reviewers complain of waiting waiting waiting.

Addendum two months after making my review:

Some reviewers counsel patience, but others state that they simply are not served, or that the service is rude.  One cook and maybe one server work the shop. Also, others complain of not getting their order (not available) or getting a modified order (my experience).  I don't see the point of opening a restaurant and putting money on the table if you don't intend to operate as a functioning food-service business.  This place won't stay in business long if the owners don't correct their may deficiencies."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place! Given the limited amount of korean BBQ options in the area, I'd say this is the best one (probably one of the only ones too...). The food I had was good. Their japchae was really awesome. I'm definitely going to be coming back here some time to satisfy that craving of Korean food. 

Overall, I rate this place pretty highly! Definitely should take a look in this direction and try out the food here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 start rating because, I do believe it's as good as it gets for authentic Korean food in Madison. Having been to Korea several times to visit family I think I'm an ok judge in authenticity of flavor. 

The ambiance and decor of the place is okay. It used to be a BBQ place. Their menu has a lot of various korean BBQs. You don't get to cook them at tableside, that requires a more advanced setup and a better HVAC system. Another table ordered some and it did come out pretty quick and sizzling hot. They also have a variety of soups, lunch time specials, and appetizers. 

I ordered the Gam Ja Tang. Which is pork and potato soup and with various veggies. I enjoyed the flavor very much and it is a bit spicy but I like spicy. it was a massive bowl!  We also got Dol sot bulgogi bi bim bap. I say if you're going to get bi bim bap its so worth it to pay a couple of dollars more to get it in the hot stone bowl. I love the way the heat crispens the rice at the bottom. We also got the seafood pancake which was tasty. Even really good as leftovers. The pancake is HUGE. At home we heated it up in a pan with some oil and it got it all nice and crispy on the outside again.

The banchan here was good. The kimchi tasted almost perfect to me. Which is also why I choose to give this place a high rating. Good kimchi is a must for me since it is such a staple of Korean cuisine. 

The waitress stopped by to check us on periodically. Was attentive and really wanted feedback on what we thought of the food since they've been only open for 3 weeks. The cook came out and apologized for the appetizer (seafood pankcake) taking awhile since she had made one and didn't feel it was up to par so made a new one. I appreciate her honesty and commitment to delivering quality food. 

Most of the korean places around Madison are more fusion style and not authentic. There is one place on the west side that serves traditional Korean fare but I think the flavors at Five Star Korean BBQ are more on point."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great portion sizes. The only reason I am giving it 4/5 stars is because it is a little on the pricey side! I am a relatively picky eater so I didn't try anything too risky (; but I really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki! I definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Warning: Non-Korean reviewer.

If you can get past the staff with weak English skills, you will find what I think is the best Korean food in the city. Consistently flavorful and plentiful, well-prepared. Worth taking out after ordering online."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the corner of East Wash and Blair Street is a tough location that's had its share of businesses go under while occupying its space. 

Enter Five Star. A restaurant that aspires to offer food beyond the bland Midwestern offerings of pizza and burgers. This aspiration, however, comes at a price. Literally, it comes at a price, and quite a ridiculous one at that.

Its menu is amazing and hits all the delicious beats of a Korean restaurant while you're being served by a somewhat courteous staff. You are provided with multiple side dishes to accompany your meal and most of the time they'll give you more free if charge. I say somewhat because 2 out of the 4 times I've been here, the service has been fast and attentive. The other 2 has been the opposite.

The dukbokki is a delicious appetizer of sweet and spicy rice cakes and the cooks are willing to make it as hot as you'd like it. The pork bulgogi was drenched in flavorful sauce and came out on a sizzling platter. They have a couple different variations of jjigae, which is a kind of savory stew that comes out in a boiling bowl. All of these were wellcrafted and good, except for the head scratching price. 

The price for a two entree meal is a bit overpriced for what you get. While an American-sized appetite is hard to satisfy, even those with tinier stomachs would find that the small portions, no matter how good they may be, hardly justify the price.

This is highlighted even further with the addition of new Korean Barbeque grills where you can grill fresh meat right at your table. At the time, the price of a small handful of steak shavings is $20 and three slices of pork belly (more like bacon) is about the same. This Korean BBQ meal comes with three pieces of mushroom and an onion slice. Now, I don't know if I'm paying for the atmosphere or the service but this markup price is insane.

Sadly, this is one of the only Korean places in town that offers great authentic food, so its a bit of a sacrifice to eat here. I'll come back, but probably just to treat myself on a really good day or something. Don't do the barbeque, you can easily get more food and better variety of ingredients at home with a skillet, hot plate and a trip to Asian Midway."}
{"text":"Me and 4 others friends ate there Sunday. Our first time there. Menu little confusing for not really know what we wanted. The server was really helpful with explaining the menu. We all were very happy with the service. The food your get is a large amount. We look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever! Waited for almost 1 hour for food and it still didn't come, asked the waitress how much longer it's going to take she replied with an extreme arrogant attitude, she said: This is nothing( how long we have been waited), some people would wait for over 2 hours. We only have one cook, you want our food you'll have to wait. Well, I guess I didn't really want your food because I left right away."}
{"text":"So glad this place is here. Had the soondubu jigae. Was delicious as was the kimchi pancake. I'll have to come back for actual BBQ."}
{"text":"Must admit I went here with an equal interest in seeing if the food was as good as some of the reviews state as I was in seeing if their would be any knife-waving yelling and screaming from the staff.  Happy to say that the food was really good, and there was no drama (it was a perfectly normal experience with friendly staff!).  

Went for lunch and stuck to the lunch menu-- only 5 or so choices (3 were bulgogis) but they come in a (big!) Korean bento-box format with several sides and rice (the menu said that the lunch specials come with soda, but we weren't offered any and I typically stick to water anyway).  Dishes I saw on other tables that didn't stick to the lunch menu looked great.  All in all, I'd go again."}
{"text":"So as someone who's lived close to Koreatown for four years, I LOVE Korean BBQ. I was starting to lose hope that I'd have any kbbq in Madison, but I heard about this place from a friend. If you're expecting LA level KBBQ prices and taste you may need to adjust your expectations. This isn't the best Korean BBQ I've had (or the cheapest) but it's the midwest. If you're looking for some delicious, authentic Korean food then you'll enjoy this place. The place is run by Koreans, has a large menu (ranging from bibimbap, hot and cold soups, Korean barbecue, etc) and has great service. I came here on a Saturday night with a group of about 20 people and we immediately got served. This is a great place to go in a group (the tables for KBBQ are 4-6 people each but there are tons of tables). If you're looking to eat tons of meat expect to pay about $20/person. We were a group of four and ordered 4 meat dishes and were completely stuffed. Each plate of meat comes with a serving of rice and Korean appetizers (fish cakes, kimchi, etc.). Definitely, come with an appetite! Also for those who have never had Korean BBQ and are hesitant, three of the people I ate with had never eaten it before and LOVED IT. So it's definitely for everyone. Just make sure to ask the waiter about the spiciness level of each dish. The service was also wonderful- the woman was incredibly attentive and friendly. Would 100% come back and recommend this place to others! They take credit card and will split your bill if you come in a large group too."}
{"text":"This aptly named Korean restaurant served up one of the best meals I've had in Madison. A friend and I swung by for dinner last night and we were both blown away by the food. There was not a crumb left over because I could not stop eating. I wish I had ordered a second serving to take home with me so the eating wouldn't have to stop. I had the Bolgogi beef and my dinner companion had Bipimbap. We also received some complimentary Korean veggie side dishes (kim chi, seaweed, sprouts etc). It was all delicious. 

The prices were reasonable, service was prompt, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Only one issue...NO ALCOHOL. That stung a little bit at first but by the time the food came I completely forgot about it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a joke. No service at all. We ordered kimchi with pork, but it comes with the picture, no meat at all. We have been waiting for one hour and no food comes at all. The waitress speaks very poor and not responsive at all."}
{"text":"Was busy at the dinner hour (good sign). Looks like they are still getting situated in their space as some of the decor is of previous tenant.  

I had the bulgogi pork which is served on a sizing plater. Had good spice and was delicious. Entree came with pickled radish, kimchee, pickled tofu, and broccoli salad. 

Hit the spot. 

Will come back again!"}
{"text":"They do not seem as if they are prepared to open yet. There are boxes stacked in a corner, a table as a workspace with a toolbox, somebody busily unpacking. Much bustle and loud conversation in what I assume to be Korean and seems dissatisfied in tone behind counter. I had a lunch special for $9.99, the portion was average for price as it came with a can of soda, no fountain set up.yet. Came in bento box, veggies were past their prime. Came with Japanese miso soup, barely passable, lukwwarm. Had shreds of radish in one space. Low quality meat that was bland, lukewarm. There were small fried crescents that were tasty, filled with vegetables and grain, and the Kim hee was good, however these are not enough to save the lunch.  The soy sauce is on the table with salt and pepper placed on a white dinner plate, instead of a soy bottle. There are rolls of paper towel on the table, likely leftover from recent days as a barbecue joint (with decent barbecue). It is bland and nondescript in here, feels unwelcoming. Wish this was a Korean place in LA. Oh my gosh, the server just came and took her tip off the table! I give up. Don't come here.."}
{"text":"This place is rather new and serves decent Korean dishes. I have been there three times and was satisfied with the food every time. They offer a wide range of menus and have nice space for a bigger group. However, they definitely need more staffs as they are beginning to attract more customers. Sometimes you have to wait more than an hour without even getting a menu. The waiting could go up to two hours, but the owner doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"The most authentic Korean food that I have found in Madison!  While the other restaurants are very good, this one tastes like my Korean mother is in the kitchen.  Luscious Kalbi , terrifiic Jab Jae, and soul satisfying Soon du bu Jigae are just a few of the highlights. Will go (and have gone) again and again."}
{"text":"**** Please read before going!!

My boyfriend and I are visiting Madison for friends and decided to come to a Korean BBQ joint because we all love it. We decided on trying this place because some friends referred it to us. We went on a Thursday night and we got seated at a regular table and asked the server if sitting at a grilling table was okay. She responded with attitude saying they \"had no meat.\" Then turned to my boyfriend and I, said a very curt \"sorry\" and proceeded to push past us. So confused, we sat down. We were looking over the menu and as she was bringing iced water, I asked if they served hot tea and again, she responded with a negative and poor attitude with \"no. We don't serve that.\" And it's hard to explain how rude her demeanor was but it instantly turned me off after her first. But I decided to ignore it and started to order, it was a slow night but she stuck to our table as we were still deciding and got noticeably annoyed that we were debating on options. We were finally ordering and my friend asked if they had brown rice. The waitress didn't even look up from her pad of paper and waved in my friend's face signaling a \"no.\" So that was it for us, we were baffled. The order went in but we got up and said we were leaving. We all left in pretty bad spirits because we were so excited to try out a new KBBQ place. But this place is NOT the restaurant to be at. I swear, she looked like she was ready to spit in our food. Just don't."}
{"text":"This place fills the hole that is missing in Madison's culinary landscape. They serve good and diverse Korean food in the campus/capital area. The location might make them overlooked by people, not to mention their facade is a old bar with minimal focal point.

Pro:
- Diverse menu offering 
- Generous portion
- Serves Banchan () - assortment of side dishes serves as appetizers

Con:
- Limited staff (I did not experience this problem, but it might affect their service during busy hours)
- Hours seems irregular (would recommend calling them before going there)

My friend and I ordered:
- Kimchi Pajeon (Kimchi pancake) -- the pancake is fluffy and the spiciness is just enough to make the food enjoyable. The kimchi in our portion was not strong enough, however.

- Budae Jigae -- it has generous portion of carbs, protein, and vegetables. The broth has some spicy kick to it, which is great. Meat lovers please beware that this menu has more carbs than the proteins. They do include proteins such as tofu, spam, and bacon, but you might want to adjust your carnivorous expecation accordingly.

- Jajangmyeon with seafood -- your classic black soybean paste noodles, but ten times better with seafood. They have crab and clam, which add a spin and add a great depth of flavor to the sauce.

Please do not complain when you see the menu and see average price of $11 - $16 per dish. Their size is hearty, and it can worth 2 - 3 meals. 

There were only 3 people in the kitchen who juggles between prepping the food and servicing customers. I would advise people be more considerate and patient. We were actually amazed because they are really quick on their feet in serving us and constantly checking our needs. Best of all - they keep their smiles at all times.

I am quite excited to try other dishes to this new addition in the Madison foodie community."}
{"text":"We came here on a reservation for around 15 people, ordered food ahead of time on the phone, then when the food came out, at least 3 dishes were wrong. Since they wouldn't take back the incorrect dishes, we just ended up eating and paying for them anyway, which is fine but then they refuse to let us pay our bill with one card. Our card wasn't even a credit card, it was a debit card. So, one of our friends had to drive all the way back to state street for an ATM to take cash out. It's outrageous that they flat out refuse to let us pay for our bill with a debit card just because our party was big. I've come here before with only 2 other people and we were able to pay with a card just perfectly fine. The service here is horrendous, and I'm never coming back here again even though the food isn't too bad. 

5 star bbq? More like 1 star."}
{"text":"The reviews about service scared me, so my group of 5 showed up at 6pm. The place was empty and we were seated right away. I got the galbi (thank you, Yelpers!) and my friends got jjigae and two plates of meat for KBBQ. It's overpriced but I really enjoyed the galbi. And the appetizers (banchan) were all good. My dish was voted the fan favorite. At the checkout, the server told me the galbi is marinated with 6 different fruits. It was so tender. Yum! 

Service was fine. Phew. I had to ask for more water from time to time but overall, okay."}
{"text":"The bibimbop take out is definitely worth it--plus you get soup and 4 side dishes for under $13. No complaints here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! TRUE Korean food. 
Things to check out: kalbi (short rib), any of the jigae (the spicy soups), and the bibim nang myun (cold spicy noodles)."}
{"text":"The waitress had really bad attitude! And there is no pork in the pork with kimchi at all!"}
{"text":"I would rather eat cup ramen noodles. Some shady crap going on in here. The korean waitress made my husband go to the atm to get cash because she couldn't void a payment she closed as cash she said. Doesn't make any sense. They can't void anything because the owner doesn't live in Madison? I will never go back because the food was terrible too."}
{"text":"For the first time in my life I've ever wanted to share my opinion on yelp so badly-They have AMAZING staff and service.

Came in late night and got seated at the bar area. Waited quite a long time for the menu, and 20min for water. 
Then starts the tragic drama:
There were lots of people waiting for food , and also seats. There were only three staff, which two ladies started to yell at each other. One began to slam all the dishes she could and using F words. They had wrong orders, and having food delivered to wrong tables. After a 1hr wait and seeing all this entertainment, we decided t follow other customers to \"politely\" say that if the kitchen hasn't started our order, we would like to cancel it and leave. After asking, the lady was waving her knife in the open kitchen with her language, and still yelling at other people.

Wow."}
{"text":"There's a new menu with slightly different food items at Five Star Korean BBQ that lists the dishes in English with the Korean translation in parenthesis, so you know the place is pretty authentic. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times for date nights and we've been here once with his siblings for Korean BBQ.

Each time, we switch it up but most recently we've narrowed down to our favorite dishes. He prefers the mackerel and I order my seafood tofu soup without any green onions and if I remember to request for no white onions either. 

My favorite side dish is also the strips of fish cake and occasionally seaweed or kimchi. The dumplings are also fairly delicious. Keep in mind, the first two rounds of side dishes is free but if you request for a third one, then it's charged, and the same for an additional bowl of rice as well. 

Other than that, the wait time for food has gotten a lot better, it used to be hours before you'd be served food but if you go right after work, you'll be seated and served in no time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! All made from scratch! Owner is the sweetest lady! Amazing service to top it all!"}
{"text":"Wish I could rate as zero stars. 5 stars for food, 4 stars for value, 3 stars for service, ZERO STARS overall after talking with the owner about a bad experience there. The owner absolutely doesn't care. I tried to reasonably deal with her but she was full of excuses about being tired and wanting to get home. When I told her that's not my concern, I expect to get what I paid for, all she said was \"sorry.\" Well she did apologize, but offered nothing. And considering they've had these issues for a while I don't see how they could possibly improve.

Based on the food I'm half tempted to just occasionally deal with crappy management. But on principle I just don't want people like this making money. Permanent boycott.

Me and one other guest spent over $100 between food, drinks and tip. Our server was a great kid, he did everything right. No complaints there. It's the managers that screw it up.

Don't you hate when someone is smiling and talking very sweetly while at the same time delivering crap service? We came in near closing time and it would have been better to have turned is away. That would be fine. Or if they suggested carry out. Anything would be better than what happened.

We ate at a normal speed. We were just beginning to grill when our check was dropped off. A few minutes later the manager asked if we could pay so they could close the register. I didn't want to ruin a good night for my date by being difficult so I obliged.

A few minutes later, with both my hands holding together a lettuce leaf wrapped around meat and rice, the manager came back with the receipt and my card. But she was holding out the receipt... It took me a couple seconds to readjust my grip on the food... She was still, holding out the receipt for me... I wiped my hand on a napkin and reached out for the card and just as I was about to take it she said \"no no no keep eating I'll just leave it here!\" ??? Why did she stand there for ten seconds waiting for me to take it?

I tipped over $25 on a $75 check because our server deserved it.

Then the manager offered to help us grill. Which we didn't mind since we're new to this experience. She kept insisting that you have to cook the beef fast and then she overcooked the beef and in her hurry undercooked the thick cut of pork. I know I had been grilling a little slowly but we were liking crispy pork and rare beef until she ruined it all by dumping all meat on the grill at once and messing it up.

Then instead of eating meat hot off the grill it cooled off on our plates before we could get to it.

Next the place went dark, and employees paced in their jackets while the manager put our dinner into take-out containers. Major riddled job, high pressure to get out. I didn't finish my soup because at that point I didn't even want to ask for a carryout container. We weren't done eating and we took food home and reheated our dinner there.

Their words of niceness ring hollow when their actions are rude.

I'm not the type to complain to get free stuff. But when a business screws up it may be wise to make some sort of offer. I don't think they are capable of \"making up\" for their mistakes. Sticky fingers when it comes to money, which is reflected in their pricing.

The owner has the most at stake and has the authority to offer a discount to apologize for a bad experience. I don't know what the Korean tradition is but it's common practice here in Madison.

Honestly, it doesn't matter what the owner said as excuses. But it basically came down to everyone's been there since 9am, everyone's tired they've been there all day, and they're in a hurry to get out. At that point, when an owner is talking to you like that and you have no further recourse as a customer, you know the business is a loser.

My advice is this if you're still determined on going because the food is that good. Do not inconvenience the servers, don't expect miracles, get your food, hope it's a good experience and get out.

If they screw up and treat you like crap, guess you just gotta suck it up"}
{"text":"Our first experience to this intimate Korean restaurant was a hit!  The warm hospitality was refreshing, and it was one of the best Korean food I have ever eaten!  
We ordered Bulgogi and Jajiang.  It was delicious and cooked properly.  The noodles were tight as they should- very authentic.  The Bulgogi was marinated and cooked with no MSG and it was worth the price of $15.99.  The banchun was also fresh, crunchy, and a great compliment to our meal. Yum!
The service was amazing!  Our waitress was friendly and took care of our craving for Kimchi.  In speaking with her, we found out the Kimchi is made fresh everyday.  We weren't surprised because it was crisp and tasty.  
We can't wait to try this wonderful Korean spot for lunch as we heard their lunch box is also good and starts at $9.99.  You got to try this one of a kind Korean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went here for the Japanese food, but it seems to be mostly Korean. It was pretty yummy. I do not know Korean food to be able to say that it is authentic or not, but I thought it was pretty yummy. And huge servings for the price- especially the lunch box. The appetizer soup that came before it was also good. I wonder what it was! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Definitely a hidden gem. I don't like the fact that you can't order the lunch portion to go and that the full portions are a bit pricey, however it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm just going to start by saying that my husband and I have lived in Korea and absolutely Fell this n love with Korean food! Living in the Midwest however makes finding GOOD TRUE Korean food is pretty hard  this place is legit! We walking in the door and instantly felt like we were back in Korea! The broken English the smells all of it was absolutely delightful for us! The only down side is the parking is crap! We have an SUV and that tiny little parking lot was not very fun  but the food got an A+ in our book!!! The soup delish! The bbq DELISH!! The pickled radish MY FAV!! It was seriously all perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going here expecting spicy Korean, think again. I put half the bottle of \"gochujang\" on my Dol sot Bibimbop, and it may as well have been ketchup. Completely flavorless. Really skimpy on the meat in the Bibimbop.
Hubbs ordered the Katsu chicken, and was pleased. 
The banchan was good.
Once again, I find that I make better at home. We won't return."}
